    "description": "Reborn amid viral infamy, Lucy White dismantles her \"talentless heiress\" narrative with guzheng virtuosity, wilderness grit, and chef-level precision. As mockery turns to awe, A-lister Ethan Smith hijacks headlines by posting a video of himself pleading to publicly date her—upending his \"Ice King\" persona. Beyond the spotlight, Lucy’s hand-drawn talismans stun mystics, her films dominate awards, and her tech empire reshapes industries. When asked about retiring to inherit her family fortune, she declares, “I’ll keep acting,” while Ethan—now her doting CEO husband—vows to bankroll her stardom indefinitely. The internet’s verdict? Lucy isn’t just rewriting her story; she’s scripting a legacy where genius and love defy every limit.",

    "description": "Evelyn Sinclair thought marrying into the Blackwood dynasty would secure her future. Instead, she awakens to a nightmare—her \"husband\" Nathan is secretly funding her rival, her best friend is a spy, and her own identity is a lie. Trapped in a gilded cage, Evelyn discovers her late parents’ murder was no accident. The Blackwoods stole her inheritance, replaced her with a changeling twin, and used her as pawn in a decades-old power play. Now, with a hidden camera exposing their darkest secrets, she must navigate a deadly web of corporate espionage, arranged marriages, and a long-lost sibling determined to destroy her. Armed with nothing but a sharp wit and a thirst for vengeance, Evelyn wages war on the family that shattered her life. But when Nathan’s \"first love\" returns with proof of a secret child, Evelyn realizes the biggest betrayal might be the one she’s been living…",
