Celeste Ashford believed she had left her former life behind, and Caspian Hayes, the man whose name used to send her heart racing until the day she found herself standing outside his door. However, as her family's house hovers on the brink of foreclosure, fate pulls him back into her life. Seizing the opportunity to right the past, Caspian makes her a disturbing offer: if she becomes his wife until he succeeds his father as head of the empire, he’ll save her house. Years earlier, Celeste had disappeared from his life at his most vulnerable moment. Now, Caspian’s resentment is deep, but so is his desire. Bound by debt and obligation, they sail a treacherous sea of corporate demands, family meddling and smouldering emotions neither can ignore. When vengeance collides with yearning and secrets unspool in the unrelenting desert heat, they must each wrestle with what matters more: punishing the sins of the past or creating a love that might redefine their futures.
