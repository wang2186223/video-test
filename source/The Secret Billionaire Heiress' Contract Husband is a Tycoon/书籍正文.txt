###Chapter 1

The rain poured relentlessly.

The black Rolls-Royce Cullinan struggled along the rugged mountain road, its wipers swinging frantically against the downpour. A dull thud suddenly jolted the car, and the man in the back seat, who had been resting with his eyes closed, snapped them open.

The dim interior light outlined his sharp profile—deep-set eyes, a straight nose, and thin lips pressed into a firm line. Adjusting his suit cuff, he spoke in a low voice, "What happened?"

"I'll check right away, Mr. Sullivan."

The trembling driver stepped out, opening a black umbrella to shield the man from the rain. Long legs emerged, polished shoes sinking instantly into the mud. He frowned at the trapped wheel, rainwater tracing the line of his jaw.

"At least we didn’t hit anyone..." The driver exhaled in relief—until—

"Move."

A cold female voice cut through the storm.

The driver nearly jumped out of his skin, stumbling as he turned. Under the headlights stood a slight figure in an oversized raincoat. A yellow hard hat shadowed a pale, mud-streaked face.

But what sent chills down his spine was the shovel in her hands.

Dark red liquid streaked the metal, diluted by rain as it dripped from the blade. The driver’s legs wobbled, horror movie scenarios flashing through his mind.

"W-what are you doing here?" His voice shook.

The girl wiped her bloody hand across her wet face. "Burying something."

The driver sucked in a sharp breath, instinctively edging closer to Ethan Sullivan. A girl with a bloody shovel in the middle of nowhere, in a storm, talking about "burying something"—what else could it be?

Yet Ethan remained unfazed, his gaze sweeping over her. She was painfully thin, the raincoat swallowing her frame, her wrists so fragile they looked ready to snap. But her eyes—unnervingly calm.

"Burying what?" Ethan asked mildly, though his sharp gaze betrayed his suspicion.

The girl scowled impatiently. "A cat."

She pointed to a small mound nearby. The rain had eroded the soil enough to reveal a striped tail poking out.

The driver exhaled—then tensed again. "Our car—"

"Is stuck," she interrupted. "This road collapses all the time. If you don’t leave now, you won’t make it."

She strode to the vehicle, bent down, and—to their shock—lifted the car out of the mud with one hand.

"Get in." She shook mud from her fingers and yanked open the back door. "Take me to Skywater Villa No. 3."

A flicker of interest crossed Ethan’s eyes. He slid gracefully into the seat, studying the drenched girl. "Your name?"

"Evelyn Laurent."

She leaned back and closed her eyes, wet hair clinging to her face like a soaked kitten. Ethan noticed a fresh cut on her hand, still bleeding.

The car rolled forward through the storm. No one saw the small grave behind them, now washed open by the rain—revealing far more than one animal’s remains.
###Chapter 2

Ethan Sullivan's slender fingers paused on the car door handle.

The leather seats were splattered with mud. His brow furrowed almost imperceptibly before he turned and slid into the passenger seat. His peripheral vision caught the figure curled up in the far corner of the backseat, and his lips pressed into a thin line.

His father's words from this morning echoed in his mind: "The seventh daughter of the Laurent family, missing for seventeen years, has been found in White Stone Village. You're to retrieve her personally."

Yet after scouring the village all day, he hadn't found a trace of her. Then the storm hit during his return, trapping his car in the mud—only to stumble upon this strange girl.

"Body disposal?" A cold glint flashed in Ethan's eyes. Perfect. He'd take her back to the city and let the police handle this.

He glanced sideways. The girl was hunched into a ball, her helmet pulled low. Just as he looked away, her eyes snapped open—sharp as blades. "What are you staring at?"

In the darkness, her gaze burned like a feral cat's.

Without reacting, Ethan shrugged off his mud-caked suit jacket. "You'll catch a cold in wet clothes."

A scoff was her only reply. She yanked her helmet lower, vanishing into the shadows.

His fingers tapped twice on his knee. Something unreadable churned in his eyes.

——

Celestial Waters Estates.

The mud-streaked luxury car rolled to a stop. The driver turned with a shaky voice. "W-we're here."

Evelyn Laurent rubbed her eyes, grabbed her shovel, and pushed the door open. She paused mid-step and tossed over her shoulder without looking back: "Thanks."

Morning light stung her eyes. Squinting, she surveyed the familiar-yet-alien mansions, her grip tightening on the shovel. Ten years. She was finally back.

"Mr. Sullivan, should we—" The driver's voice trembled. His back had been drenched in sweat the entire ride, terrified the shovel-wielding madwoman might lunge at any second.

Ethan tossed his ruined jacket into a trash bin. "Head to the office." Then he pulled out his phone and dialed three digits. "Police. There's a suspicious individual at Celestial Waters Estates."

At the gates, security blocked Evelyn's path.

"Get lost, beggar!" The guard wrinkled his nose in disgust, eyeing her shovel.

Evelyn lifted her chin. "They invited me."

"You?" The guard burst into laughter. "Who the hell do you—"

Crack!

A slap sent him spinning three times. Evelyn kicked him aside. "Good dogs don't block the road."

Other guards rushed forward—only to be knocked down by her shovel. Rage simmered in her eyes. After ten years, the Laurents still played these petty games? If they wanted humiliation, she'd tear their precious gates apart.

"Evelyn Laurent!"

Vincent Lowell arrived with his wife and children, his face darkening at the sight of groaning guards.

"You bitch! How dare you—" Brandon Lowell started forward but shrank back under Evelyn's glare.

Her gaze locked onto the girl in white—a face eerily similar to Margaret Hill's, oozing condescension.

"That bastard child is still a bastard!" Margaret screeched. "Today's your wake-up call—Sophia is my real daughter! You—"

Slap!

The blow sent Margaret stumbling. Evelyn yanked her collar and delivered a backhanded strike. "Say it again. I dare you."

Vincent roared, "Evelyn!"

Crack! A third slap landed squarely on his face. "Patience. Your turn's coming."
###Chapter 3

Evelyn Laurent had always possessed extraordinary strength, but today she deliberately held back, using less than thirty percent of her power.

Since childhood, she had been far stronger than her peers. Years of roughhousing with village troublemakers and manual labor had only honed her raw power.

Even at thirty percent, it was enough to make the Lowell family suffer.

She didn’t dare use her full strength—she might have sent their heads flying.

Slap!

The sharp crack of her palm echoed through the living room. Vincent Lowell clutched his rapidly swelling cheek, lips trembling. "Y-you—"

Slap!

Another strike silenced him. Evelyn’s voice was icy. "Stuttering? Can’t speak properly?"

Sophia Lowell trembled, her bravado thin. "Evelyn, assault is illegal!"

Evelyn turned sharply. The coldness in her gaze made Sophia instantly recoil, shrinking back in terrified silence.

Brandon Lowell had already hidden behind his father, wishing he could vanish. He shook uncontrollably, praying Evelyn wouldn’t notice him.

If even his parents couldn’t fight back, what chance did he have?

Since when had this bitch become so dangerous?

A flicker of venomous hatred crossed Brandon’s eyes. If only they’d known she wasn’t blood-related back then—

"Ah!"

Agony erupted across his scalp. Brandon screamed before a flurry of slaps left him dazed, blood streaming from his nose.

"Shut up," Evelyn snapped.

Margaret Hill and Vincent, seeing their precious son attacked, finally lost control and lunged at her.

Thud! Thud!

They were kicked away before they could even touch her, crumpling to the floor in pain.

Sophia muffled a whimper behind her hands.

Evelyn’s sharp gaze locked onto her—and the hatred in Sophia’s eyes.

Slap! Slap!

Two more strikes left Sophia’s hair disheveled, her face marked with vivid handprints, tears and slick smeared across her cheeks.

Surveying the ruined family at her feet, Evelyn finally felt a sliver of satisfaction.

She crossed her arms, looking down at them. "Now. Have you learned to speak properly?"

Her gaze landed on Brandon first.

He nodded frantically. "Yes!"

Slap!

"Did I say you could speak?" Evelyn flexed her hand.

Brandon clutched his face, trembling. This wasn’t a woman—this was a demon.

"Speak. Why did you call me here?" Evelyn’s lips curled in mocking amusement.

Vincent spoke through gritted teeth. "You’re not our real daughter. Sophia is."

"Ah." Evelyn nodded. "Makes sense. All four of you share the same stupidity."

Vincent’s face twisted. "We called you to sever ties. We’ll give you money—"

"Where is it?" Her voice turned lethal.

Vincent shakily pulled out a card. "There’s a hundred thousand—"

"Pocket change?" She cracked her knuckles.

"F-five hundred thousand!" Sweat dripped down his face.

"Last chance." Her tone was glacial.

"Ten million!" Vincent shrieked. "And—information about your real parents!"

He rushed on. "They live in Cloudhaven’s Everpeace Village. Six unmarried brothers, all farmers."

Evelyn tapped her chin, watching the transfer complete before grabbing her shovel. "If I see any of you again, I’ll beat you every time."

The family seethed with humiliation—but what could they do? Their bodyguards were down, and together, they were no match for this madwoman.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

"Officers!" Margaret cried like a drowning woman clutching at straws. "She broke in and attacked us! Arrest her! Trash like her belongs in jail!"

With the police closing in, she grew bolder. "She threatened me too!"

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. In a flash, she broke through the circle—her shovel whistling toward Margaret’s face.

"Aaaah—!"

Margaret screamed as the blade stopped less than an inch from her skin, embedding in the floor.

A dark stain spread beneath her.

She fainted on the spot.

Evelyn released the shovel and slowly raised her hands, smiling coldly at the remaining three. "Just say the word if you want to die."
###Chapter 4

Vincent Lowell and his two companions froze in place, their eyes wide with shock.

The shovel was deeply embedded in the brick floor, with cracks radiating outward like a spider's web. If Evelyn Laurent had struck a person with that force, their bones would have shattered instantly.

"What are you waiting for?" Evelyn flexed her wrist. "Weren't you going to take me to the police station?"

The officers snapped out of their daze and quickly restrained her. Surprisingly, the fierce young woman became completely compliant, quietly boarding the police car.

Brandon Lowell followed unsteadily, his face swollen and his steps faltering. Vincent and Sophia Lowell were busy loading the unconscious Margaret Hill into an ambulance.

Inside the police interrogation room, Evelyn sat calmly. Her delicate fingers interlaced on the table, presenting an innocent facade.

"Start talking!" The officer slammed his hand on the table.

"They attacked first." Evelyn didn't even lift her gaze. "I have proof."

She pulled a flash drive from her pocket and slid it across. It contained footage of Brandon's predatory behavior over the years, along with bank records showing the Lowell family withholding her living expenses.

The officer frowned. "That's not what we're asking about. Someone reported you for burying a body!"

Evelyn's head snapped up. "I was burying stray animals!"

She immediately realized it must have been that meddling man from last night. The thought made her grind her teeth.

After verifying her story, the officers led her to a waiting room. Protocol required a guardian to collect her.

Evelyn leaned against the sofa, tapping her fingers impatiently on the armrest. She had no guardian left—Vincent had even DNA tested her himself, eager to be rid of his troublesome responsibility.

Meanwhile, in the top-floor conference room of Sullivan Group...

Ethan Sullivan had just picked up a document when his assistant rushed in. "Mr. Sullivan, the police called—"

Thirty minutes later, Ethan stood in the police station hallway, studying the intake form. Evelyn Laurent, 17, from White Rock Village.

His eyes narrowed. Wasn't this the person he was supposed to collect?

When the waiting room door opened, Evelyn tensed like a wary cat. Recognizing him, she sneered. "So it was you."

Ethan gave a slight nod. "A misunderstanding. I'm here to take you home."

"Home?" Evelyn scoffed. "I don't have one."

She followed Ethan outside, arching an eyebrow at the black Maybach. The driver paled when he saw her.

"See a ghost?" she said coldly.

The driver forced a laugh, sweat beading on his back. This girl could smash bricks with her bare hands!

Once inside the car, Evelyn cut straight to the point. "Who are you?"

Ethan adjusted his cufflinks calmly. "Your fiancé."

The air turned to ice.

Evelyn grabbed the door handle. "Stop the car."

"Don't be rash." Ethan caught her wrist. "Your parents abroad asked me to look after you."

"I don't need it." She shook him off. "And I definitely don't need a fiancé."

Ethan suddenly smiled. "Good. I don't want a fiancée either."

Their eyes met—and for once, they agreed on something.
###Chapter 5

The air inside the car turned glacial.

Evelyn Laurent pressed herself against the window, fingers absently tapping the leather seat. The rearview mirror reflected her tense jawline and almond eyes swirling with complex emotions.

Ten years.

Since being dumped in that remote mountain village with spotty cell service, she never imagined returning to Cloudhaven this way. Least of all discovering that deliberately concealed paternity test in the police archives.

"Ms. Laurent seems familiar with Cloudhaven?"

Ethan Sullivan's deep voice shattered the silence. His slender fingers toyed with a bronze pocket watch, its metallic clicks punctuating the stillness.

"Not really."

Evelyn tore her gaze from the window. Plane trees blurred past as dappled shadows flickered across her face. She suddenly narrowed her eyes—

Three unmarked black SUVs were tailing them in a sinister formation.

"Mr. Sullivan." Her voice turned arctic. "It appears someone objects to your homecoming."

The pocket watch snapped shut. The driver floored the accelerator, launching the Maybach into hyperspeed as the needle hit red.

"Brace yourself."

A truck loaded with steel rods careened from a side road. Amid screeching brakes, Evelyn glimpsed the driver's contorted face—and the viper tattoo coiling around his neck.

CRASH!

The deafening impact of twisting metal made her ears ring. Airbags deployed as she instinctively shielded her vitals. The car somersaulted, shearing through guardrails before landing sideways on the median.

Gasoline fumes choked the air.

Evelyn kicked the mangled door open, glass shards slicing her knuckles. Squinting through smoke, she counted a dozen machete-wielding thugs closing in.

"Mr. Sullivan!" The trapped driver yelled. "Three minutes till backup!"

She was already hefting a crumpled door panel. The steel slab whistled through the air, sending three attackers flying like ragdolls.

Ethan moved with terrifying precision. His manicured hands snapped wrists with clinical efficiency. When he roundhouse-kicked the seventh assailant, his bespoke suit remained immaculate.

"Keep one alive."

Evelyn disarmed the last goon, pressing a bloodied pipe to his throat. Then she spotted the telltale gun calluses on their hands.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Ethan adjusted his cufflinks, moonlight silvering his profile. He picked up a ringing phone and purred into the receiver: "Tell Charles Kensington..."

"I accept his welcoming gift."

Three armored Range Rovers screeched to a halt. Twenty black-suited bodyguards bowed in unison—their leader's serpent earring matching the truck driver's tattoo.

Evelyn's pupils contracted.

Now she knew who this ambush was really for.
###Chapter 6

The bodyguards efficiently hauled up the groaning thugs from the ground.

The interrogation was swift. These were mere hired hands with no knowledge of who hired them.

A cold glint flashed in Ethan Sullivan's eyes. He hadn't expected useful leads from such small fry.

Once the questioning ended, he had them delivered straight to the police station.

Evelyn Laurent stood by, watching coldly. She casually yanked the trapped driver out of the wrecked car.

After the farce concluded, they switched to another vehicle.

Evelyn eyed Ethan warily, her voice icy. "Who are you really?"

According to Vincent Lowell, her parents came from a remote village called Yongning.

How could such a backwater produce a man with this commanding presence?

Luxury cars. Bodyguards. Even Vincent couldn't match this level of extravagance.

If the police hadn't verified his identity, she'd never have gone with him.

"Ethan Sullivan. Current head of the Sullivan family in Capital City." His tone was casual, as if stating the weather.

Evelyn's pupils contracted sharply. Even living in White Rock Village, she'd heard of the Sullivans.

The conglomerate's helmsman. The nation's wealthiest man. A business legend.

"Bullshit." She suddenly laughed derisively. "You're Ethan Sullivan? Then I'm the heiress of the Langley family!"

Ethan nodded indifferently. "Correct."

With a cold snort, Evelyn turned away, refusing to engage with this smooth-talking liar.

Outwardly refined as jade, but who knew what schemes lurked beneath?

Ethan reclined lazily in his seat, a frosty gleam surfacing in his eyes.

He'd told her the truth. Believing it was her choice.

Meanwhile, at Central Hospital in Seacliff City...

Margaret Hill awoke from unconsciousness, her swollen face still etched with terror.

Only after confirming Evelyn's absence did she relax.

"Mom!" Sophia Lowell threw herself at the bedside, eyes red. "Brandon's being held at the police station. Dad went to get him—"

"What?!" Margaret nearly fainted again. "That little bitch actually dared—"

Her precious son was the Lowell family's future heir!

Not only had Evelyn laid hands on him, she'd called the police?

The hospital door suddenly swung open.

Vincent entered with Brandon, both wearing thunderous expressions and prominent injuries.

"Where's Evelyn?" Margaret hissed through clenched teeth.

"Her family took her," Vincent said grimly.

Brandon's face twisted. "Dad, we have to make that bitch pay!"

Vincent waved a hand. "Forget her for now. The Langleys in Capital City found their missing seventh daughter. They're throwing a homecoming banquet."

His eyes gleamed with ambition. "This is our chance to climb into the Langleys' good graces."

Margaret's eyes lit up. The Lowell fortunes had declined recently. A connection with the Capital City Langleys...

"I hear they're making a huge deal about this seventh daughter," Vincent murmured. "If we can win her favor..."

Greed flashed across the family's faces, temporarily pushing Evelyn from their minds.

Sophia suddenly spoke up. "Mom, Dad—I got accepted as an exchange student at Harvard."

"Really?" Vincent's voice rose excitedly. Harvard was the nation's top university!

Margaret hugged her daughter proudly. "That's my girl! That bastard Evelyn isn't fit to lick your boots!"
###Chapter 7

Vincent Lowell swatted Margaret Hill's hand away with a dark expression. "Don't mention that jinx. Hurry and prepare the gifts. We can't be late for Miss Evelyn's birthday banquet."

Margaret's cheerful expression faded, replaced by worry. "But the Langley family in the capital is an elite dynasty. We can't even touch their doorstep."

Brandon Lowell and Sophia Lowell exchanged frustrated glances.

Vincent gritted his teeth. "I pulled some strings to get us positions as waitstaff."

"What?" Margaret shrieked. "You want us to serve tea and water?"

Sophia clenched her skirt, her nails digging into her palms.

Vincent slammed the table. "You don't understand! Countless people would kill for this opportunity!"

His burning gaze locked onto Sophia. "This is your chance to enter elite circles. Once you get into Harvard..."

Sophia's eyes lit up briefly before dimming again.

Margaret muttered resentfully, "It's all that jinx's fault..."

A ruthless glint flashed in Vincent's eyes. "We'll deal with her when we get back."

Meanwhile, in the VIP lounge of Cloudhaven International Airport.

Evelyn Laurent eyed Ethan Sullivan warily. "Where are you taking me?"

Ethan tapped the armrest with his long fingers. "Home."

"My parents are in Evergreen Village," Evelyn scoffed. "Or are you planning to kidnap me?"

He arched a brow. "How much are you worth?"

She sat down without hesitation. "A free plane ticket? I'm not passing that up."

Ethan typed a message on his phone. "Your little wildcat has sharp claws."

Three hours later, at the capital's international airport.

Evelyn eyed Ethan's full disguise. "Afraid to be seen?"

Ethan remained silent.

His bodyguards stifled laughter.

A group suddenly rushed toward them from the VIP corridor.

"Evelyn!"

Before she could react, Evelyn was engulfed in a warm embrace.

"I finally found you..." Victoria Langley wept uncontrollably.

Evelyn stiffened like a startled cat.

Six sharply dressed men surrounded them, their eyes red-rimmed.

Richard Langley gently pulled his wife back. "Don't scare her."

Victoria's trembling hands cupped Evelyn's face. "You've lost weight..."

Evelyn took a step back, her gaze sharp. "Don't call me family until the DNA results come back."
###Chapter 8

"The paternity test must be done."

Evelyn Laurent's voice was icy, freezing the entire living room into silence.

Victoria Langley's fingers trembled violently. Her eyes reddened instantly. She gripped Evelyn's wrist with bruising force.

"No test needed. You are my daughter!"

Victoria's voice shook. After seventeen years, she had finally found her child. That face—bearing seventy percent resemblance to hers—those identical peach-blossom eyes needed no proof.

Richard Langley stood behind his wife, his Adam's apple bobbing. His gaze burned into Evelyn's face as if trying to reclaim seventeen lost years.

"Evelyn, we've searched for you for seventeen years."

Her six brothers stepped forward in unison, surrounding her. Their eyes shimmered with the same wild joy—the euphoria of recovering something precious.

The accident seventeen years ago had haunted the Langley family like a nightmare. Victoria had been ambushed during premature labor in Cloudhaven. She awoke to news of her daughter's death—yet she distinctly remembered hearing an infant's cry before losing consciousness.

They had scoured the country, even registering DNA in global missing persons databases. Three days ago, a police call made them abandon everything to return home.

Evelyn felt the warmth on her wrist. Her brows furrowed slightly. She withdrew her hand calmly, creating distance.

"The test is necessary."

Her soft voice brooked no argument.

The Lowells' betrayal had taught her caution. Love didn't appear from nowhere. She was accustomed to licking her wounds alone—this sudden affection was unnecessary.

Victoria's tears hit the floor. Her daughter's guarded stance pierced her heart.

"Fine. We'll do it."

——

At Harvard Genetics Center, Evelyn mechanically opened her mouth for the oral swab. Seven pairs of burning eyes never left her.

The VIP lounge was oppressively silent.

Evelyn sat in the corner, fingertips absently tracing the sofa edge. Across from her, the Langleys were statues—their gazes locked on her.

"Results are ready."

Evelyn shot up when the technician entered. She snatched the report, eyes darting to the conclusion:

[Genetic match: 99.99%. Biological relationship confirmed.]

The paper trembled in her hands.

"I knew it..." Victoria embraced her from behind, hot tears soaking her collar. "My Evelyn..."

Her six brothers closed in. Evelyn looked up into breathtakingly handsome faces. The adoration in their eyes stole her breath.

That look—she knew it too well.

As a child, she'd peek through door cracks watching Brandon Lowell cradled in his parents' arms. Margaret Hill's gaze at him held the universe's most treasured thing.

Eventually, she stopped hoping.

Yet now—that very gaze was fixed on her.

Evelyn clenched the report, knuckles whitening. Her eyes burned. Something wild and warm erupted in her chest.
###Chapter 9

Evelyn Laurent was enveloped in Victoria Langley's tight embrace. The delicate scent of her mother's perfume lingered in the air. She felt dampness on her shoulder - Victoria's tears.

"My precious daughter, let's go home." Victoria released her, wiping away tears with a tender smile.

As the motorcade glided through bustling streets, Evelyn stared blankly out the window. Victoria kept holding her hand, chattering away despite receiving only occasional responses.

The gates of Beverly Hills slowly parted. Evelyn's pupils contracted slightly. Each mansion resembled a miniature palace, surrounded by breathtaking gardens.

"Welcome, Miss Evelyn!" Two rows of servants bowed in unison.

Evelyn froze, fingers unconsciously clutching her clothes. She remembered Vincent Lowell telling her that her biological parents were rural farmers.

Richard Langley noticed her confusion. "Yongning Village is our ancestral home," he murmured softly.

Evelyn suddenly recalled what she'd said to Ethan Sullivan. Her cheeks burned. He had been telling the truth all along.

The villa's interior surpassed her wildest imagination. When Victoria showed her the rooms, Evelyn nearly held her breath. Every space was meticulously designed, down to the unique curtain patterns.

"All this is yours." Victoria opened the walk-in closet door.

Evelyn stood transfixed. An entire floor of clothing, shoes and bags, organized by color scheme, glittered under the lights.

"We prepared new pieces every year," Victoria said, voice trembling. "Waiting for your return."

Under the warm shower spray, Evelyn felt like she was dreaming. The bathtub was larger than her former bed, with mirrors that never fogged.

Meanwhile, the living room downstairs was thick with tension.

"Have you confirmed everything?" Victoria's voice was icy.

Richard handed her a file, knuckles white. Her six brothers stood nearby, expressions dark and dangerous.

Victoria's hands shook as she reviewed the documents. When she read about "winter cold showers" and "sleeping in storage rooms," her nails dug into her palms.

"The Lowells of Seaview City..." She spoke through gritted teeth, murderous intent swirling in her eyes.

When Evelyn came downstairs dressed in fresh clothes, she sensed the frozen rage in the air. Instinctively, she halted, spine stiffening. This oppressive atmosphere was all too familiar - it always preceded Vincent's outbursts.

Were they... angry with her?
###Chapter 10

The tense atmosphere in the living room dissolved the moment Evelyn Laurent descended the stairs.

Victoria Langley's face instantly brightened. She rushed forward in three quick steps and seized Evelyn's hands. "My darling Evelyn, you look absolutely stunning in this outfit!"

The icy expressions on Richard Langley and his six sons melted away instantly.

Evelyn was momentarily dazed by the sudden warmth. Before she could react, she was gently pulled onto the sofa.

Six strikingly different brothers stood before her in a perfect line.

"Evelyn, I'm your eldest brother, Alexander Langley."

"I'm Sebastian Langley, your second brother."

"Julian Langley, your third brother."

"Nathaniel Langley, the fourth."

"Dominic Langley, number five."

"Theodore Langley, your sixth brother!"

The youngest, Theodore, beamed. "Finally, I'm not the baby anymore!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together softly. "Hello, Mom, Dad... brothers."

That simple greeting made the entire family's eyes glisten with emotion.

Who would have thought these formidable figures, each a titan in their own right, would now revolve around one young woman?

"Evelyn, Mom bought you ten luxury villas."

"Dad's giving you a few companies to play with."

"Sebastian designed a custom wardrobe and jewelry collection just for you."

"Julian's card here has half a billion."

"Nathaniel's private hospital is yours now."

"Dominic prepared another half billion."

"Theodore got you ten limited-edition sports cars."

In moments, property deeds, black cards, and car keys piled around Evelyn.

Victoria was still calculating. "In a few days, I'll buy you a private island."

Evelyn waved her hands hastily. "Really, that's too much."

She gazed at these priceless gifts, her heart swelling with complex emotions.

This was warmth she'd never known in her seventeen years.

Victoria embraced her gently. "My poor Evelyn suffered so much. Those who hurt you will pay dearly!"

A cold glint flashed simultaneously in the six brothers' eyes.

"How would you like to deal with the Vincent Lowell family?"

At that name, Evelyn's eyes turned glacial. "I'll destroy them myself."

Victoria smiled approvingly. "That's my daughter! We'll host your homecoming gala in three days. The world will know the seventh Langley heiress has returned."

Evelyn hesitated. "But..."

Victoria was firm. "Everyone must recognize your status."

Evelyn stopped protesting, warmth flooding her heart.

She studied her family discreetly:

Father Richard Langley, helm of the Langley conglomerate.

Mother Victoria Langley, empress of a global cosmetics empire.

Eldest brother Alexander, venture capital legend.

Sebastian, ruler of elite fashion brands.

Julian, Oscar-winning actor.

Nathaniel, medical prodigy.

Dominic, top-tier attorney.

Theodore, founder of a luxury automotive empire.

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips.

She couldn't wait to see Vincent Lowell's face when the truth came out.
###Chapter 11

Evelyn Laurent sat by the floor-to-ceiling window of the Langley family mansion. Sunlight streamed through the glass, casting a warm glow over her. She looked down at her hands, her nails neatly trimmed and rounded.

Victoria Langley approached with a fruit platter, setting it gently before her. "Evelyn, have some fruit."

"Thank you," Evelyn replied politely, though she didn’t reach for it.

Victoria sighed softly at her reserved demeanor. She turned and dialed her husband’s number. "Don’t come back yet. Let Evelyn adjust for a few days."

Richard Langley’s voice came through the phone. "Understood. We’ll handle the banquet preparations in the meantime."

After hanging up, Victoria glanced back at Evelyn. The young woman was staring out the window, lost in thought, sunlight dappling her lashes with delicate shadows.

At the Sullivan estate, Ethan Sullivan stepped out of his car and strode through the front gates without expression. The butler greeted him. "Young Master, your father is waiting for you."

In the living room, Vincent Sullivan set down his newspaper. "Where’s Evelyn?"

"Returned to the Langleys," Ethan replied flatly.

Vincent frowned. "Did you give her the gift?"

"No." Ethan removed his suit jacket. "She needs time with her family."

Vincent nodded thoughtfully, then brightened. "What about gifting the Langleys the East District land?"

Ethan didn’t respond, heading straight upstairs.

Once behind closed doors, his expression darkened. He opened his laptop, and an encrypted chat window appeared.

"Any updates?"

The reply came swiftly. "Still no leads, boss."

Ethan’s fingers hovered over the keyboard before typing, "Keep searching."

He shut the laptop and pulled a velvet box from the depths of his drawer. Inside lay a faded woven charm bracelet.

At thirteen, he’d been kidnapped and locked in a basement. In the darkness, a small girl had taken his hand.

"My name is Cici," she’d whispered, a red butterfly tattoo behind her ear.

They’d promised to meet under the great tree at the mountain’s base. But when night fell, his men brought only grim news: "That girl... might be gone."

Ethan clenched the bracelet, his knuckles whitening.

A knock came at the door. "Young Master, dinner is ready."

"Understood." He tucked the box away, his stormy expression smoothing into practiced calm.

The mirror reflected a man of effortless grace. Ethan adjusted his tie, lips curving into a perfect, measured smile.

He would find Cici. As for Evelyn Laurent? She was merely a temporary arrangement.
###Chapter 12

News of the Langley family's grand homecoming gala for their long-lost heiress Evelyn had sent shockwaves through high society.

The Grand Hyatt, the crown jewel of the Sullivan empire, blazed with light. Crystal chandeliers scattered prismatic brilliance across the ballroom as staff perfected every detail.

"Look up, Miss Langley."

Evelyn sat motionless before the vanity as the stylist traced her features. The mirror reflected porcelain skin and cool, distant eyes.

"Mother, isn't this excessive?"

Her fingers twisted in the priceless couture gown. Seventeen years of ordinary life left her unprepared for such opulence.

Victoria Langley squeezed her daughter's hand. "This is your birthright, darling. Tonight all of Manhattan will witness the return of the Langley princess."

Footsteps announced the arrival of her six brothers. Their collective breath caught at the vision before them.

"Ethan Sullivan doesn't deserve this," Theodore muttered.

The words barely escaped when a tall figure appeared in the doorway. Ethan stood framed in black bespoke, diamond cufflinks glinting like stars.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn - the same girl he'd seen covered in construction dust, now breathtakingly transformed.

"Speechless, Mr. Sullivan?" Victoria teased.

"Miss Langley is radiant tonight," Ethan admitted freely.

Evelyn turned away coldly. This arranged marriage meant nothing to her. Were it not for her family, she'd gladly remain invisible.

"Ethan, show Evelyn the venue," Victoria said with a meaningful glance. "And remember - no one lays a finger on my daughter."

Ethan's mouth twitched at the police report flashing through his mind.

Harm her?

The real danger was Evelyn sending someone to the ER.
###Chapter 13

The car door slammed shut.

Evelyn Laurent sat stiffly in the passenger seat, her face icy.

"I don't acknowledge this engagement." She stared straight ahead, her voice sharp as frost. "I don't need a fiancé."

Ethan Sullivan's long fingers rested on the steering wheel. He chuckled softly.

"Your mother seemed to think otherwise just now."

Evelyn whirled to face him.

Her amber eyes burned with scorn.

"Didn't Mr. Sullivan declare he didn't need a fiancée?" Her red lips curved mockingly. "How easily 'your mother' rolls off your tongue now."

Ethan started the car with deliberate calm.

"Family arrangements take time to undo." His tone was mild, but his gaze remained glacial. "This isn't the moment."

The temperature in the car plummeted.

Evelyn studied him through narrowed eyes.

Unfazed, Ethan withdrew a document from his inner jacket pocket and handed it to her.

"Read this."

Evelyn flipped through the pages, fingertips brushing the paper.

The terms were clear—Ethan needed a decoy while searching for someone long missing. One million monthly, ten billion upon termination.

She scoffed and signed without hesitation.

"Deal."

Surprise flickered in Ethan's eyes.

"No questions?"

Evelyn tossed the contract back.

"Mutual benefit." She adjusted her cuffs carelessly. "Saves me from other arranged matches."

The car descended into The Grand Hyatt's underground garage.

Meanwhile, at the service entrance.

"Stay sharp!" Mr. Liu snapped impatiently. "You're lucky to get in at all."

Vincent Lowell bowed obsequiously. "We won't cause any trouble, sir."

Behind him, Brandon kicked aside a mop in disgust.

"Dad, we're really doing janitor work?"

"Quiet!" Vincent hissed. "Tonight's crowd is elite. One connection could change everything!"

Sophia Lowell touched up her lipstick, pulse racing.

This was high society!

The elevator doors slid shut.

Margaret Hill gasped suddenly.

"I thought I saw—"

"Impossible." Brandon snorted. "No way Evelyn Laurent would be here."

Vincent shook his head firmly. "That country bumpkin couldn't even get past the front gates."

But Sophia stared at the closing elevator, pensive.

That man... he looked familiar.

In the VIP corridor, crystal chandeliers bathed the hallway in light.

Evelyn's heels clicked sharply against marble.

"Clever play, Mr. Sullivan." Her voice cut the silence. "Avoiding marriage while pacifying the elders."

Ethan paused mid-step.

"Likewise." He turned slightly. "Miss Laurent gets her peace too, no?"

They exchanged smiles—each hiding calculations.

The ballroom loomed ahead.

Suddenly, Evelyn tensed.

She glanced back. The hallway stood empty.

"Something wrong?" Ethan asked.

"Nothing." She faced forward again. "Just my imagination."

Around the corner, in a service closet, Sophia clamped a hand over her mouth, heart pounding.

It was Evelyn!

And that man beside her—the head of Sullivan Group!
###Chapter 14

"Evelyn? Here?" Brandon scoffed, waving his hand dismissively. "Impossible. That trash doesn't belong in a place like this."

His lips curled into a sneer at the mention of Evelyn Laurent.

Sophia blinked, then smirked. "Must've been my imagination."

Contempt flickered in her eyes.

The Lowell family had scraped together five million just to sneak into this gala as janitors. Only officially invited VIPs could access the elevators.

Who did Evelyn think she was?

The four of them composed themselves and entered the ballroom, gawking at everything like wide-eyed country bumpkins.

The Grand Hyatt's opulence exceeded their wildest dreams. Priceless antiques they'd worshiped back home were mere decorations here.

Vincent discreetly eyed a Ming vase with an eight-figure price tag.

He nearly choked.

The gap between a provincial tycoon and old-money elites was staggering.

This only strengthened his resolve to cozy up to the Langley heiress. Failing that, he'd settle for rubbing shoulders with other bluebloods...

Soon, the family split up.

Vincent worked the room, schmoozing with guests. Brandon ogled debutantes, practically drooling.

Sophia clung to Margaret's arm, scanning the crowd for eligible bachelors. Yet her mind kept drifting back to that striking man by the elevator.

If only she could meet someone like him...

Her gaze kept darting toward the elevators, hoping for another glimpse.

Ding.

The doors slid open.

Sophia craned her neck—only to freeze.

"Evelyn?!" she shrieked. "What are you doing here?"

Margaret whirled around, her pupils contracting.

So she hadn't been mistaken earlier! How did this little bitch get in?

Evelyn turned at the commotion. Spotting the mother-daughter duo in janitor uniforms, her nose wrinkled.

Just my luck.

She'd just helped Ethan change upstairs. Finding the ballgown cumbersome, she'd planned to change back before the main event.

Now this unpleasant reunion.

"Evelyn!" Margaret stormed over. "Who let you in?"

Evelyn lifted a bored eyebrow. "None of your business."

Margaret's face purpled. "Do you even know where you are? This is no place for trash like you!"

Her eyes burned with envy at Evelyn's casual athletic wear.

They'd paid millions to sneak in as staff, yet this waltzed in like she owned the place?

She must've snuck in!

"Security!" Margaret screeched. "An intruder without an invitation!"

She grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "Are you trying to sabotage Miss Langley's gala?"

"Get off!"

Evelyn yanked her arm free, sending Margaret sprawling.

"Evelyn!" Sophia put on a show of concern. "Mom's just worried. This is the Langleys' event—not some backwater party you can crash."

Noticing gathering onlookers, she lowered her voice. "Leave before the Langleys notice."

Evelyn flexed her wrist, smirking. "Try making me."

"You insolent—" Margaret scrambled up. "Think this is Harbor City? You can't act wild at the Langleys'!"

Spotting the growing crowd, she turned performative.

"Everyone, look at this ingrate! She stole my daughter's privileged life for seventeen years, assaulted her adoptive parents, and now crashes the Langleys' gala!"

Margaret's voice rose with faux outrage.

Perfect chance to impress Miss Langley while ruining this bitch. She'd make sure Evelyn left in disgrace tonight.
###Chapter 15

Without hesitation, Evelyn grabbed the woven basket and hurled it at the two intruders.

The siblings stumbled backward, caught completely off guard.

Fueled by adrenaline, Evelyn chased after them relentlessly.

The boy tripped over a root and went sprawling, slamming hard against an oak trunk.

Though no bones were broken, the impact would leave him sore for days.

Evelyn couldn't help laughing at his狼狈 posture.

His sister hastily helped him up, and they fled in disgrace.

Amused, Sophia watched the scene unfold.

"What did they do to provoke you?" Evelyn asked while gathering scattered herbs.

Sophia produced the wild eggs from her pocket. "They wanted these."

Evelyn kept her head down. "Pheasant eggs are rare finds."

"Pathetic, attacking someone over eggs." She assumed there was only one.

Sophia cradled her treasure. "Who said anything about one?"

Evelyn's head snapped up.

Two eggs?

"Oh my God!"

Her eyes widened at the clutch in Sophia's hands.

"How did you find so many?"

No wonder they'd tried stealing them!

Anyone would covet such a prize.

Evelyn abandoned her basket, staring transfixed.

The more she looked, the more precious they seemed.

"These could trade for weeks of provisions in town."

The wealthy merchants prized such delicacies.

She lined the basket with soft herbs, carefully nestling the eggs inside.

A thick protective layer went on top.

"Safe now," she declared.

Sophia nodded approvingly at the clever arrangement.

Shouldering her load, Evelyn started homeward.

"Imagine catching the actual bird," she mused. "That meat's divine!"

But she knew it was wishful thinking.

Pheasants were notoriously elusive.

After several paces, she realized Sophia hadn't followed.

"Coming?"

Sophia arched a brow. "You want the pheasant?"

Evelyn shook her head. "The eggs are blessing enough."

"Those birds don't surrender easily."

Sophia beckoned. "Over here."

Puzzled, Evelyn approached.

"Part those ferns."

With skeptical fingers, Evelyn complied.

"Holy—!"

Sophia urgently signaled silence.

Clapping a hand over her mouth, Evelyn's eyes shone with disbelief.

"How did you know it was here?"

Sophia smiled wryly at the sudden term of respect.

One pheasant had bought the girl's loyalty.

To Evelyn, Sophia might as well have performed magic.

"Spotted it earlier. Its leg's injured."

Evelyn lifted the bird, confirming the wound.

"You're charmed today!"

Eggs and now the bird itself—both delivered to hand.

Evelyn regarded Sophia with newfound awe.

She'd misjudged this woman—clearly a bearer of good fortune.

Anticipating roasted pheasant, Evelyn grinned from ear to ear.

"Let's gather more greens," Sophia suggested.

The current herbs wouldn't conceal the bird.

Evelyn nodded eagerly. "Rest, I'll forage."

She worked swiftly, soon filling the basket to capacity.

On their return, they encountered village women.

"Productive morning, Evelyn?"

The group closed in curiously.

Evelyn's palms grew damp. "The heat's rising—we should hurry back."

"Look, half these are weeds anyway."

She displayed a handful as proof.

As the women began dispersing, a muffled cluck sounded.

"What was that?"

"Sounded like fowl!"

"Wild fowl? That's rare!"

The circle tightened again.

Evelyn broke into a cold sweat.

Caught.

Sophia pointed dramatically. "Look! Over there!"

The women stampeded toward the false lead.

The duo seized their chance to escape.

Heart pounding, Evelyn finally relaxed upon reaching home.

In the kitchen, Margaret fretted over meager lunch options.

A new daughter-in-law deserved better fare.

Her calculations were interrupted by Evelyn's breathless arrival.

"Back so soon?"

She frowned at the messy herb bundle. "You've brought weeds!"

Another woman came to help sort.

Evelyn gasped for air, speechless.

Despite scolding, Margaret brought water.

Then came the shriek: "Margaret! Look!"

"A pheasant!"
###Chapter 16

Evelyn lunged forward and kicked Vincent to the ground.

"Ah!"

Vincent howled like a slaughtered pig, rolling in humiliation.

"Ungrateful wretch! You ill-bred trash!" He clutched his stomach, snarling.

Evelyn smirked, yanking his collar before delivering a dozen sharp slaps.

Slap! Slap! Slap!

The crisp sounds echoed through The Grand Hyatt's banquet hall.

Blood gushed from Vincent's nose. His teeth loosened as he collapsed, trembling.

"Evelyn! This is The Grand Hyatt!" Margaret shrieked.

Evelyn backhanded her, sending the woman spinning three times.

"I'm beating all you garbage today!"

She seized Margaret's hair, raining more blows.

Brandon scrambled to escape.

"Running?"

Evelyn stomped on his back.

"Didn't get enough jail time? Who let you insult me?"

She grabbed a chair and smashed it over him.

"Ah! Help!"

Brandon wet himself, sobbing for mercy.

The hall fell deathly silent.

Every guest gaped at the spectacle.

This athletic girl fought like a storm, her words sharper than blades.

Upstairs in the VIP lounge, Ethan Sullivan never looked away.

He'd never seen her unleash violence like this.

That ferocity reminded him of the stubborn little girl from years ago.

"Ethan, that's the Langley heiress?"

Oliver Valentine appeared behind him, eyeing the scene with amusement.

"Hmm." Ethan's response was curt.

"Tsk. Such a spitfire. You'll have your hands full." Oliver teased.

A dark glint flashed in Ethan's eyes as his lips curved slightly.

Below, Evelyn finally paused, breathing hard.

Vincent's family lay crumpled like discarded rags.

Sophia wept into her hands, hatred burning in her heart.

Then the banquet doors swung open.

The Langleys entered with their six sons.

Victoria Langley's face darkened at the wreckage.

"Mr. Langley! Madam Langley!" Vincent cried like a drowning man. "This bitch ruined everything! Throw her out!"

Margaret screeched, "Make her kneel and apologize!"

Victoria's icy gaze swept the room. "Who disrupted my daughter's party?"

Evelyn dusted her hands and turned.

The hall became so quiet you could hear a pin drop.
###Chapter 17

Brandon Lowell gasped in pain but stubbornly straightened his back.

He glared at Evelyn Laurent with a sinister smirk. "Evelyn, it's not too late to get on your knees and beg for mercy!"

Evelyn crossed her arms, her cold gaze fixed on the ridiculous spectacle before her.

The faces of Vincent Lowell's family of four were twisted with malice and triumph, as if they could already see Evelyn groveling in humiliation.

Victoria Langley's eyes were frosty.

Richard Langley swept his gaze across the room, ensuring his daughter was unharmed before finally settling on Vincent.

The six Langley brothers' expressions darkened dangerously.

To humiliate Evelyn right in front of them?

They were asking for death.

Vincent remained oblivious to the danger. Instead, he fawned as he stepped forward. "Mrs. Langley, I'm Vincent Lowell of Lowell Group in Cloudhaven. This girl may be my adopted daughter, but we've long severed ties! Such an ill-mannered creature deserves—"

"Silence!"

Victoria's sharp command instantly hushed the entire room.

Alexander Langley lifted a hand, his voice icy. "Security."

A team of well-trained guards swiftly filed in.

The eldest Langley heir's presence alone seemed to drop the temperature of the banquet hall.

"On your knees," he ordered Vincent, his voice like frozen steel. "Apologize."

Before Vincent could react, security forced him down with a brutal shove.

The sickening thud of his knees hitting the marble floor sent chills down everyone's spines.

"W-what—?" Vincent looked up in terror, meeting Evelyn's indifferent stare.

The guests who had earlier clamored to have Evelyn thrown out now paled in horror.

Alexander's gaze swept over the crowd. "Who was it that demanded her removal?"

A chorus of sharp inhales echoed through the hall.

Security forced Brandon's head down, slamming it against the floor. "Apologize!"

Blood trickled from Brandon's forehead, staining the carpet crimson.
###Chapter 18

Evelyn Laurent stood at the center of the ballroom, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

Her gaze swept over the crowd kneeling before her, a flicker of mockery in her eyes.

These very people had sneered at her moments ago. Now they groveled like beaten dogs.

"Miss Laurent, we were wrong!"
"Please forgive our ignorance..."
"We didn’t recognize your status..."

Their pleas echoed through the grand hall.

Alexander Langley stood beside her, his slender fingers lightly tapping a crystal glass.

Each sharp chime sent a tremor through the kneeling figures.

"Get out." His voice was ice.

Security immediately moved in, roughly hauling the offenders to their feet.

"Wait." Evelyn's voice cut through the tension.

The room held its breath.

She stepped toward Vincent Lowell, looking down at the man who'd once called himself her father.

"Mr. Lowell," she said softly, "Now do you see who the real bastard is?"

Vincent's face turned ashen. His lips trembled, but no words came.

"Throw them out." Evelyn turned, her gown swirling gracefully.

What followed was a spectacle.

A dozen well-dressed socialites tumbled through the doors like discarded toys.

The Lowell family—all four of them—were shoved out last, their humiliation complete.

Outside, the winter wind cut like knives.

"This is your fault!" A middle-aged man grabbed Vincent by the collar. "If we hadn't listened to your lies—"

Fists rained down.

Vincent curled on the pavement, his face bloodied.

His hate-filled eyes remained fixed on The Grand Hyatt's golden doors.

Inside, the daughter he'd discarded was being treated like royalty.

While his family lay in the gutter where they belonged.

"Dad..." Sophia Lowell wept prettily. "What do we do now...?"

Vincent clenched his jaw.

This wasn't over.

Back inside, Evelyn accepted a champagne flute from a waiter.

"Satisfied?" Alexander asked.

Evelyn studied the golden liquid. "This is just the beginning."

The chandelier's light danced in her eyes like flames.

The gala continued, but everyone knew—

After tonight, the power structure of the city would never be the same.
######Chapter 19

Outside The Grand Hyatt, Vincent Lowell lay sprawled on the ground like a dead dog. He struggled to rise, his nails digging deep into his palms.

Margaret Hill had just regained consciousness and immediately burst into sobs. Sophia Lowell wept pitifully, her face streaked with tears. Brandon Lowell lay on the ground rolling his eyes, drool dripping from the corner of his mouth.

"Shut the hell up!" Vincent roared before wincing in pain. His hands trembled as he pulled out his phone to call an ambulance, his eyes dark with fury.

The ambulance arrived with flashing blue lights. Even as the paramedics lifted the stretcher, Vincent continued grinding his teeth and muttering curses.

Tension crackled through the banquet hall. Guests exchanged glances but no one dared approach. New arrivals immediately sensed the charged atmosphere.

Victoria Langley hurried toward Evelyn Laurent, grasping her hand and steering her toward the elevators. "Are you hurt?" Her voice shook.

Evelyn flexed her wrist. "They got the worse end of it."

Only after a thorough inspection did Victoria finally exhale in relief. She whisked her daughter straight to the penthouse suite, smacking her forehead in frustration along the way. "This is all my fault for not anticipating this."

Evelyn paused while unzipping her tracksuit.

"Wear whatever you want from now on." Victoria carefully straightened Evelyn's collar. "You didn't sprain your wrist during the... altercation, did you?"

Evelyn froze. She'd braced for scolding, not this. Her chest ached as if soaked in warm water—tender and swollen with emotion.

"Mom." She suddenly grabbed Victoria's hand. "I hit someone in public—"

"Good!" Victoria squeezed back. "Pity we didn't get it on video though." She clicked her tongue in genuine regret.

Evelyn's eyes burned. So this was how unconditional love felt.
###Chapter 20

Victoria Langley's expression froze instantly.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she gently touched Evelyn Laurent's cheek. "Silly girl, what nonsense are you saying?"

She gave Evelyn's forehead a light, affectionate flick. A tender smile warmed Victoria's eyes. "My daughter must have looked magnificent throwing punches. I'll ask Ethan for the video and frame it to admire every day."

That playful flick carried such warmth it made Evelyn's heart tremble.

She pressed her lips together, emotions churning in her eyes.

Seeing her daughter's silence, Victoria felt like needles were piercing her heart.

Vincent Lowell's venomous curses echoed in her ears. The horrifying details from the investigation files flashed before her eyes. Tears blurred her vision instantly.

"Evelyn..."

She pulled Evelyn into a tight embrace, her voice shaking with emotion. "Mommy failed you..."

If only she'd been more careful back then, maybe she wouldn't have lost her precious jewel.

This was the daughter she'd yearned for after six sons!

Since their wedding, she and Richard Langley had dreamed of a little princess. Yet six boys arrived first.

Then came Evelyn.

The day they confirmed it was a girl, Victoria wept with joy. She immediately filled the nursery with princess dresses and jewelry, determined to spoil her daughter rotten.

But fate played a cruel joke.

This belated love arrived seventeen years too late.

Her daughter, who should have lived in luxury, endured seventeen years of hardship.

Just thinking about it made Victoria's chest tighten with pain.

Evelyn stood stiffly, arms hovering awkwardly in the air.

Such intense maternal affection overwhelmed her.

After flexing her fingers uncertainly, she finally whispered, "Mom, it wasn't your fault."

Victoria wiped her tears and linked arms with Evelyn. "Darling, it's your time to shine."

She gazed into Evelyn's eyes with conviction. "I know you dislike attention. But everyone at The Grand Hyatt tonight represents high society in the capital and beyond."

"They must remember you, Evelyn Laurent, as the Langley family's princess!"

"I'll ensure they keep your information confidential."

Victoria gently smoothed Evelyn's stray hairs. "Sweetheart, your father, brothers and I will always stand by you."

"You can...try leaning on us."

Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest as she felt the weight of that unconditional love.

"Mhm."

After a long pause, she gave a quiet response.

Taking her mother's hand, Evelyn offered a small smile. "Let's go."

Tonight's gala belonged to her.
###Chapter 21

Night fell as the lights of The Grand Hyatt flickered to life one by one.

The banquet hall on the first floor had been completely restored, showing no trace of the earlier chaos.

Guests gathered in small clusters, their gazes repeatedly drifting toward the second floor.

"That girl in the tracksuit..."

"It must be Evelyn Laurent, the seventh daughter of the Langley family."

"The Sullivans didn't even throw her out..."

Whispers spread through the crowd. Everyone remembered the agile girl in black from earlier—and The Grand Hyatt's unusual tolerance.

Just last month, the young master of the Montgomery family had been blacklisted by the Sullivans for merely breaking a glass here.

On the raised platform, Richard Langley adjusted his bowtie. Behind him stood his six distinguished sons, while the Sullivan father and son stood to the side.

"Thank you all for joining us tonight," Richard's voice echoed through the hall. "Today marks my daughter's homecoming."

He paused, scanning the room.

"We trust you'll keep this matter confidential. In return, the Langleys and Sullivans will open select partnership opportunities."

The moment he finished speaking, the banquet hall plunged into darkness.

A single spotlight illuminated the grand staircase on the second floor.

Victoria Langley descended gracefully with Evelyn on her arm. She wore an onyx mermaid gown, its subtle embroidery shimmering in the light.

But all eyes were glued to the young woman beside her.

Evelyn's white evening gown cascaded like liquid starlight, countless diamonds catching the light with every step.

Her chin lifted slightly, porcelain skin glowing like pearls under the spotlight. Those phoenix eyes—identical to Victoria's—swept coolly across the room.

"My God..."

"Is that really the same girl who..."

Gasps rippled through the crowd as mother and daughter descended. The diamond fringe at Evelyn's waist swayed gently, accentuating her slender silhouette.

The spotlight followed her like a loyal attendant.

When she reached the center of the platform, the hall fell utterly silent. Guests held their breaths, as if fearing they might disturb this suddenly materialized princess.

Evelyn stood bathed in light, diamonds refracting brilliance across her gown. The corners of her lips lifted in a faint smile.

In that moment, everyone understood—the seventh daughter of the Langleys had returned.
###Chapter 22

Vincent Sullivan's gaze never left Evelyn Laurent, his eyes brimming with paternal affection. The girl carried herself with innate grace, and her earlier display of authority had been both fierce and captivating—like a young leopard baring its claws, equal parts adorable and dangerous.

Under the spotlight, her composed demeanor mirrored Victoria Langley's elegance. An air of natural poise and quiet confidence radiated from her.

Vincent subtly nudged Ethan Sullivan's elbow.

Ethan schooled his icy expression into a polite smile. He stepped forward, taking Evelyn's delicate hand from Victoria, who gracefully retreated to Richard Langley's side.

The two figures stood side by side—one clad in black, the other in white.

One cold as frost, the other warm as jade.

Their contrasting auras blended seamlessly, as if destined to complement each other.

The Langley family gathered behind them, their gazes tender as they watched Evelyn. Ethan held her hand loosely, feeling the slight chill of her skin. She merely frowned faintly but didn’t pull away.

"This is Evelyn Laurent, the seventh daughter of the Langley family," Ethan announced, his voice smooth though his smile didn't reach his eyes. "And my fiancée."

His sweeping gaze turned the room frigid.

Richard followed with a grave warning. "My daughter values her privacy. Should anyone dare disclose her identity—" Before he could finish, the six Langley brothers hardened their expressions, their collective presence casting an oppressive weight over the ballroom.

Oliver Valentine observed from the front row, intrigued. Beside him, a young woman in white clenched her fists, resentment burning in her eyes. A sharp glance from her brother forced her to swallow her words.

"Rest assured, Mr. Langley," Oliver spoke first. "The Valentines will remain discreet."

A chorus of agreements rose from the crowd. No one dared defy the combined authority of the Langleys and Sullivans.

When the lights brightened again, Victoria guided Evelyn through the gathering of socialites, eagerly introducing her to every eligible young woman. She longed to present the world's finest offerings to the daughter she had once lost.

The memory of Evelyn's lonely past twisted Victoria's heart. From now on, her precious girl would never be alone again.
###Chapter 23 

The chandeliers of The Grand Hyatt blazed with blinding brilliance.

Evelyn Laurent stood in the corner of the ballroom, her fingertips absently tracing the rim of her champagne flute. The fractured light from the crystal overhead scattered into tiny sparks in her eyes, yet failed to pierce the darkness within.

"Little Seven, are you tired?"

Victoria Langley appeared beside her without warning, gently adjusting the shawl draped over her daughter's shoulders. Evelyn realized with a start how rigid her own posture had become.

"Mother, I'd like to return home."

Her voice was feather-light, brushing against Victoria's heart. The matriarch's eyes softened with concern as she summoned the chauffeur. "Take Miss Evelyn back to the manor to rest."

As Evelyn wove through the glittering crowd, countless heated stares clung to her back. The pitying smirks and scornful glances she'd endured in Cloudhaven had transformed overnight into sycophantic admiration.

Three days ago, she'd been the discarded daughter mocked across high society. Now, she was the Langley family's treasured jewel.

The bathroom mirror reflected Isabella Valentine's contorted expression.

"How dare she?" The diamond-encrusted clutch slammed onto the marble countertop, making her two lackeys flinch. "That backwater peasant has no right standing beside Ethan!"

The faucet screeched as she twisted it violently, the gushing water failing to drown her shrill voice. Perfectly manicured nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

"Don't upset yourself, Bella," cooed the girl in pink tulle. "I heard she dropped out of high school and ran with street gangs."

"Exactly," the other chimed in. "Mr. Sullivan's only tolerating her because of their engagement contract. After he sees your piano recital—"

Isabella silenced them with a raised hand.

The reflection showed a girl whose lips now curved into a serene smile, all traces of fury erased. She reapplied her lipstick with deliberate strokes. "Next month's charity gala will show everyone what a true socialite looks like."

Water droplets fell from the gold-plated faucet, splashing against the marble like the first whispers of a spreading conspiracy.

At the corridor's end, Ethan Sullivan leaned against a fluted column, moonlight through stained glass dappling his sharp profile like an aristocrat stepped from a Renaissance painting.

Isabella's footsteps instinctively softened. Watching him check his watch, her heartbeat stuttered. A man of his caliber deserved a refined heiress like her—not some uncouth...wildling.
The bathroom lights glared harshly.

Evelyn Laurent touched up her lipstick in the mirror while her two lackeys fussed over her hair. 
######Chapter 24

"Isabella, only someone like you deserves a golden boy like Mr. Sullivan."

"That Jiang—no, Evelyn—who does she think she is..."

Before they could finish, the stall door at the far end swung open. Evelyn stepped out expressionlessly and walked to the sink.

Isabella's lipstick clattered to the floor. "You—you were eavesdropping?"

Water rushed from the faucet. Evelyn methodically washed her hands without glancing up. "You weren’t exactly whispering."

The two lackeys paled, instinctively stepping back.

Isabella flushed with anger. "Evelyn Laurent! Don’t you dare act so smug!"

"I’m curious," Evelyn shut off the tap, flicking water from her fingers. "What’s so special about Ethan Sullivan that has you all obsessed?"

"You—"

"If you like him, go after him." Evelyn tilted her head. "Gossiping behind his back? Pathetic."

Isabella’s face burned. She clenched her fists. "Stop pretending you’re above this! Everyone knows you’re his fiancée!"

"Not for long." Evelyn shrugged. "Arranged marriages aren’t my thing."

She turned to leave but paused. "Next time, pick a better spot for your little chats. The walls here are paper-thin."

The bathroom door slammed shut.

Isabella stood frozen before finally snapping out of it. "Did she just... mock me?"

Her lackeys exchanged uneasy glances.

"Please. She’s just bitter." Isabella smirked, adjusting her skirt. "She knows she’s not good enough for Ethan."

Her steps were light as she exited, already picturing Evelyn’s humiliating exit. A triumphant smile curled her lips.
###Chapter 25

Evelyn Laurent made only a brief appearance at the banquet before slipping away unnoticed. She headed straight for the penthouse suite at The Grand Hyatt, shutting out the sounds of clinking glasses and lively chatter behind her.

Victoria Langley watched her daughter leave with aching tenderness in her eyes. She never forced Little Seven to do anything against her will.

Just as Evelyn settled on the edge of her bed, her phone vibrated.

The caller ID displaying "Prof. Benjamin Klein" softened the usual sharpness in her features.

"Evelyn!" The elderly man's excited voice crackled through the line. "When are you coming to Cambridge? I've arranged your dorm—just bring your suitcase!"

Benjamin Klein's voice brimmed with barely contained anticipation. "Don't worry about tuition either. This old man even secured your financial aid! With your talents, scholarships will be effortless."

The corners of Evelyn's lips lifted. "Professor, I'm already in Cambridge."

"What?" Benjamin's voice cracked with excitement. "You're here already? Where are you staying? Move into my house immediately!"

"I have accommodations." Her voice remained gentle. "Thank you for your concern."

Hanging up, Benjamin beamed with unrestrained joy. He immediately pulled out his phone, eager to share the wonderful news with his colleagues.

Evelyn stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, gazing at the city's glittering lights below.

Memories surfaced of that physics competition two years ago. She'd been a temporary backstage worker who solved every competition problem during breaks.

That was when Benjamin Klein first noticed her. The distinguished professor had pursued her for two hours of conversation, forging an unlikely friendship across generations.

For two years, Benjamin had tried to sponsor her education, but she always refused. Until last month, when the professor used his Harvard University special admission privilege.

As night deepened, Cambridge's elite tossed and turned. Some regretted tonight's missteps, others schemed how to approach the seventh Langley daughter.

Evelyn remained motionless, her reflection in the glass revealing her composed expression. Tomorrow would mark a new beginning.
###Chapter 26

 Evelyn Langley's return sent shockwaves through the elite circles of the city.

The ballroom buzzed with activity as camera flashes lit up the space. Evelyn stood under the spotlight in a white evening gown, her aloof expression barely masking her discomfort.

Victoria Langley immediately noticed her daughter's unease. After a brief appearance, she whisked Evelyn away from the chaotic event.

"Have all these gifts delivered," Victoria instructed the butler, gesturing to the mountain of presents. "Send them directly to Miss Evelyn's suite."

The black Maybach glided away from the hotel. Evelyn absently traced the embroidery on her dress while watching neon lights blur past the window.

"Are you tired, darling?" Victoria squeezed her daughter's cold hand. "I know you dislike these events."

Evelyn lowered her lashes. "I'm just...not used to it."

"The world must know you're our most precious treasure," Victoria murmured, stroking Evelyn's hair. "From now on, we'll decline any invitation you don't like."

Evelyn's heart trembled. She'd never experienced such unconditional devotion before.

Richard Langley watched them through the rearview mirror. "Evelyn," he said suddenly, "I have a question for you."

Victoria shot her husband a warning look but still prompted, "What are your plans after graduation? We'll support whatever you decide."

Silence filled the car.

"I didn't take the college entrance exams," Evelyn admitted softly.

Victoria's eyes instantly welled up. The investigative reports about Evelyn's turbulent childhood flashed through her mind, each memory like a needle piercing her heart.

"That's alright," Richard said calmly. "I can arrange admission to any university you choose."

Evelyn lifted her gaze, amber eyes glinting. "A professor offered me special admission."

Both parents froze.

"Professor Klein from Harvard," Evelyn continued. "He said my mathematical talent shouldn't be wasted."

Richard's grip on the steering wheel tightened. The mathematics department at Harvard—even the Langley family would need considerable influence to secure admission there.
###Chapter 27

Evelyn took a deep breath and spoke solemnly, "Dad, Mom, there's something I need to tell you."

Richard Langley and Victoria Langley set down their teacups simultaneously, their gazes fixed intently on her.

"I've been granted special admission." Evelyn enunciated each word clearly. "No need to take the entrance exams."

Victoria's teacup tilted abruptly, spilling tea onto the tablecloth. She ignored the mess and grasped Evelyn's hand. "Evelyn, what did you say?"

Richard frowned deeply. "Special admission? Which university?"

Evelyn sensed her parents' tension and replied softly, "Harvard University."

The living room fell into absolute silence.

Victoria's fingers trembled slightly. She knew exactly what Harvard represented—the most prestigious institution in the country, where only a handful of students gained admission through special recruitment each year.

"Evelyn..." Victoria's voice quivered. "Are you certain this is real?"

Evelyn nodded. "Professor Klein personally recommended me."

Richard suddenly stood and paced across the room. He stopped abruptly and stared at Evelyn. "Professor Klein? The eminent physicist?"

"Yes," Evelyn answered quietly.

Victoria covered her mouth, her eyes instantly welling up. She pulled Evelyn into a tight embrace. "My precious daughter! I'm so proud of you!"

Evelyn froze in her mother's warm arms, inhaling the faint scent of her perfume. She had expected skepticism and doubt, not this overwhelming display of affection.

Memories flooded back—the time in elementary school when she'd rushed home excitedly after acing a midterm exam, only to be slapped across the face by Vincent Lowell, who accused her of cheating. Her tearful explanations had earned her harsher punishment.

"Mom..." Evelyn's voice cracked. "You...don't doubt me?"

Victoria cupped her daughter's face, her gaze steady as stone. "Why would we? You're our daughter."

Richard approached and gently ruffled Evelyn's hair. "I believe in you. Harvard doesn't make mistakes."

Evelyn's eyes suddenly brimmed with tears. She lowered her head, not wanting her parents to see her emotional state.

"But..." she whispered. "My grades weren't good before..."

Victoria tenderly wiped away her tears. "Silly girl, that was because of your environment. Now that you're home, of course you'll shine."

Richard snorted coldly. "Let's see who dares call our Evelyn a country bumpkin now!"

Evelyn looked up and saw the pride gleaming in her father's eyes. In that moment, she knew—their joy was genuine. They truly celebrated her achievement.

"Dad, Mom..." Evelyn's voice was barely audible. "Thank you."

Victoria hugged her again, whispering in her ear, "We should be thanking you—for coming back to us."

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, stretching their three shadows long across the floor until they merged into one.
###Chapter 28

Evelyn Laurent's fingers twisted the hem of her blouse unconsciously.

Victoria Langley's words—"I'll always believe in you unconditionally"—acted like a key, gently prying open the hardest lock in her heart. Her throat tightened, her eyes burned, and she hastily lowered her head.

"Silly child." Victoria pulled her into a tight embrace.

The warmth of the hug left Evelyn stiff. She caught the faint scent of jasmine on her mother—an unfamiliar yet comforting sensation of safety.

A single tear fell onto Victoria's shoulder.

"Mmm." Evelyn finally managed a soft sound from her throat. Something inside her chest quietly melted away.

The next morning, sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains into the room.

Evelyn hesitated in front of her walk-in closet before finally selecting a light beige tracksuit. The girl in the mirror looked less sharp around the edges.

"Miss, the car is ready," the butler reminded her softly outside the door.

Morning light refracted through the café's glass door.

Evelyn chose a private booth by the window, ordered, and gazed outside. She had arrived half an hour early, her fingertips tapping idly against the table.

The rich aroma of coffee filled the air.

She noticed a familiar figure entering. Ethan Sullivan wore a dark gray suit today, his sharp gaze behind gold-rimmed glasses as piercing as ever.

Harrison Whitmore moved to follow, but a single glance from his boss stopped him in his tracks.

"What a coincidence." Ethan took the seat across from her without invitation.

Evelyn's spine straightened reflexively. "I'm waiting for someone."

"I can see that." Ethan glanced at the two coffee cups on the table. "Professor Klein is late?"

Her pupils constricted slightly. How did he know?

As if reading her mind, he adjusted his glasses. "I overheard keywords during your phone call yesterday."

Outside the floor-to-ceiling window, Professor Benjamin Klein hurried across the street.
###Chapter 29

Evelyn Laurent tapped her fingers lightly on the table, her icy gaze fixed on Ethan Sullivan across from her.

"None of your business."

Her voice was frosty, sharp as shards of ice.

Ethan's brow furrowed briefly before smoothing out. He should be used to this by now—Evelyn always kept her guard up, pushing everyone away.

"Cambridge isn't like Cloudhaven," he said, lifting his coffee cup. "Watch your back, or you'll end up getting played."

A flicker of mockery crossed Evelyn's eyes.

"Save your concern."

Ethan set the cup down with a crisp clink against the saucer. He adjusted his suit cuff, his tone casual. "About the old man—"

"Be my guest."

Evelyn didn't even glance up.

As Ethan turned to leave, the café door swung open. Four silver-haired men entered in single file, led by Professor Benjamin Klein, whose sharp eyes immediately locked onto Ethan.

"Ethan!"

Ethan strode forward and bowed respectfully. "Professor Klein."

He greeted each elder in turn—Professor Montgomery stroking his beard, Professor Whitmore giving a slight nod, and Professor Ashford clapping him on the shoulder.

"We brought you here to meet your junior," Professor Klein said, his crow's feet crinkling with delight.

Ethan looked surprised. "You made an exception?"

"She's worth it." Professor Klein scanned the café, his pride growing when he didn't spot the person he sought. "I spent two years chasing her down before I finally convinced her."

Ethan's gaze darkened with intrigue.

For Professor Klein to hold someone in such high regard…

"Professor."

A cool voice came from behind. Evelyn stood at the edge of light and shadow, all traces of frost gone as she bowed respectfully.

"Evelyn!" Professor Klein hurried over, taking her hand and presenting her to the group. "This is the Evelyn Laurent I've told you about."

Ethan's pupils contracted sharply.

Evelyn Laurent?

His fiancée?

"Meet Professors Montgomery, Whitmore, and Ashford," Professor Klein introduced proudly. "From now on, they'll be your seniors."

Evelyn greeted each one politely—until her eyes landed on Ethan. The corner of her lips twitched almost imperceptibly.

"Senior?"

Her voice lifted slightly, laced with amusement.

Ethan's throat moved as he suddenly found his tie too tight.
###Chapter 30

Evelyn Laurent's lips curved into a faint smile as she bowed respectfully to the three elderly men. "Good afternoon, professors."

"This is your senior, Ethan Sullivan. He's quite the celebrity at Harvard University."

Professor Benjamin Klein introduced with enthusiasm.

When Ethan's name was mentioned, a subtle shift crossed both their expressions.

Evelyn's gaze met Ethan's deep, assessing eyes. A flicker of surprise passed through them. She blinked, then nodded politely. "Hello, senior."

Professor Klein's eyes darted between them. "Do you two know each other?"

"Yes."

"Not really."

Their simultaneous but contradictory answers made the professor raise an eyebrow. He didn't press further, continuing to introduce Evelyn to the other three professors.

Under Ethan's arrangement, the group moved to the largest private room in the café.

"Evelyn, I brought these old fellows here today to show them something extraordinary!"

Professor Klein sat across from her, his eyes crinkling with pride.

The three professors studied the composed young woman before them with veiled curiosity.

Her poised demeanor and quiet confidence betrayed no trace of her supposed rural upbringing.

Without further preamble, Professor Klein produced a test from his briefcase. "Evelyn, solve this."

She accepted the papers, scanned them briefly, and began writing.

The room fell silent.

All three professors watched her moving pen with rapt attention.

Ethan leaned back in his chair, his intense gaze fixed on Evelyn.

He never expected the prodigy Professor Klein raved about would be Evelyn Laurent.

Records showed a chronic truant with failing grades. Yet the girl before him solved problems with fluid grace, her pen dancing across the paper.

The soft scratching of her pen filled the private room.

Professor Klein crossed his arms, beaming with pride. The three professors grew visibly astonished.

Ethan narrowed his eyes.

This was a side of Evelyn he'd never seen.

Not the prickly girl from before. Not the ice-cold assassin. Here, she radiated focus and confidence—a brilliance impossible to ignore.

Like a pearl long buried in dust, finally revealing its true luster.
###Chapter 31

Evelyn's pen glided swiftly across the paper, its scratching sound filling the air.

She was so focused that loose strands of hair fell across her forehead unnoticed.

An hour passed as she solved the final problem.

"Professor Klein, I'm finished." She handed over the exam with trembling fingers.

Benjamin Klein accepted the papers and immediately passed them to the three professors. "Take a look. This is the apprentice I've chosen."

The professors huddled together, their eyes gleaming behind spectacles.

"This problem-solving approach..."

"She's even mastered advanced calculus?"

"She just graduated high school!"

Professor Montgomery suddenly looked up. "Young lady, have you considered studying mathematics with me?"

"Step aside, Montgomery. Her physics aptitude makes her perfect for my program!"

"Nonsense! Chemistry offers far better prospects!"

Professor Klein stroked his beard in amusement. "Now you're fighting over her? Who was it that said high schoolers weren't capable?"

Evelyn glanced uncertainly at her mentor.

"Don't worry." Professor Klein patted her shoulder. "Let them teach you whatever they want. You'll always be my official protégé."

Ethan Sullivan stood nearby, his eyes warm with approval. "Miss Laurent truly has remarkable talent."

"Then what are we waiting for?" Professor Klein waved his hand. "Let's get her enrolled at Harvard immediately!"

As the group reached the doorway, the glass door suddenly swung open.

"Ethan!"

Isabella Valentine stood framed in the entrance, her cheeks flushed. Her smile faltered momentarily when her gaze landed on Evelyn.

Ethan's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly. "What are you doing here?"

"I...I came to see Professor Klein..." Her voice trailed off as her eyes locked onto Evelyn's hand resting on the professor's arm.
###Chapter 32

Isabella Valentine stood at the café entrance, her fingers tightly gripping the strap of her purse.

She had dressed meticulously today, hoping for a chance encounter with Ethan Sullivan.

Instead, she was met with Professor Benjamin Klein first.

Her eyes lit up when she spotted the familiar figure emerging from the café.

"Professor Klein!"

She hurried forward with a ninety-degree bow, presenting her resume with both hands in reverence.

"I'm Isabella Valentine from the Valentine family. I've applied to the Physics Department this year and wish to become your protégé."

Professor Klein paused mid-step.

His brows furrowed slightly as he glanced at the resume.

"No more apprentices."

The blunt rejection made Isabella's face stiffen.

"But—"

As she prepared to showcase her awards, a familiar figure caught her peripheral vision.

Evelyn Laurent?!

Isabella's pupils contracted sharply.

Evelyn walked calmly behind Professor Klein, carrying several academic textbooks.

"Evelyn, let's go."

The professor's affectionate tone sent a tremor through Isabella's heart.

Evelyn responded indifferently without even sparing her a glance.

Two black sedans drove away in succession.

Isabella remained on the steps, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"How dare she..."

Her hands trembled as she pulled out her phone.

"Oliver, find out immediately if Evelyn Laurent is enrolling at Harvard University!"

A puzzled voice came through the line. "Her? That's impossible—"

"I saw her with Professor Klein myself!" Isabella's voice turned shrill. "Ethan must have pulled strings for her!"

Her gaze burned into the retreating taillights.

The rejected resume crumpled into a ball in her clenched fist.
###Chapter 33

Sunlight filtered through the sycamore leaves, casting dappled shadows on Harvard University's cobblestone paths. The ivy-covered walls exuded an air of scholarly gravitas befitting the nation's most prestigious institution.

Evelyn Laurent stepped through the shifting patterns of light, her curious gaze taking in the centuries-old campus. Students clutching textbooks hurried past ornamental rock gardens, the crisp autumn air carrying traces of ink and parchment.

"That's Professor Klein!"
"Oh my god, Ethan Sullivan is here too!"
Whispers rippled through the courtyard.

Professor Benjamin Klein led the way, occasionally turning to explain historical landmarks. Ethan maintained a respectful half-step distance, though his attention never wavered from Evelyn's silhouette.

"The headmaster's office," Professor Klein announced, rapping his knuckles against an antique oak door.

Dr. Gregory Evans didn't look up from his paperwork. "Enter."

His fountain pen clattered onto the desk when he recognized the visitors. The typically stern administrator practically tripped over himself rushing forward. "Professor! You came in person?"

His eyes lingered a beat too long on Evelyn.

"Allow me to introduce," Professor Klein beamed, crow's feet crinkling, "my youngest protégé, Evelyn Laurent."

Dr. Evans inhaled sharply. As the professor's former student, he understood the weight behind that single word—"protégé." It meant this delicate-looking girl had earned the endorsement of physics' greatest living mind.

Outside the window, a tall figure melted into the shadows, his phone screen still glowing with an unsent message.
###Chapter 34

Professor Benjamin Klein cleared his throat, his gaze sweeping across the room.

"I've already submitted her special admission application. Today we're here to complete the enrollment process."

Dr. Gregory Evans frowned slightly, his eyes lingering on Evelyn Laurent's youthful face. "Professor Klein, even with your recommendation, she must pass the entrance exam," he said firmly.

"I understand the rules." Professor Klein gave a slight nod.

Dr. Evans turned and retrieved a sealed exam packet from the safe, handing it to Evelyn. "This is Harvard University's special admission test."

"It covers physics, mathematics, biology, and other advanced subjects," he added. "The passing score is 80 out of 100."

Evelyn took the exam, her fingers lightly tracing the paper.

Without even glancing at the questions, she walked to an empty seat and began writing.

The scratch of her pen filled the room.

The office door suddenly swung open, revealing Oliver Valentine. He nodded politely to the group, but his eyes remained fixed on Evelyn.

Could this girl, raised in the countryside, really pass Harvard's special admission exam?

Oliver sidled up to Ethan Sullivan and whispered, "Is your fiancée really up for this? These special admission spots are highly coveted."

Professor Klein's sharp gaze cut through the air like a blade.

"Are you doubting my protégé?"

A chill ran down Oliver's spine. He quickly raised his hands. "Professor, that's not what I meant!"

Others in the room, including Dr. Evans, shot disapproving looks before refocusing on Evelyn as she worked.

Oliver awkwardly pulled Ethan out of the office.

"What's really going on here?" he demanded the moment the door closed.

Ethan remained impassive. "You saw for yourself."

Oliver ran a hand through his carefully styled hair. "Professor Klein actually took her as his final disciple?" He studied his friend suspiciously. "This isn't some scheme of yours—"

Before he could finish, Ethan's expression turned icy.

"Do you think Professor Klein can be manipulated?" His voice dripped with frost. "When he refuses someone..."

Ethan stepped closer, each word sharp as a blade. "Not even God himself could change his mind."

He gave Oliver's shoulder a meaningful pat. "Your family should know that better than anyone."

Oliver winced. "Don't remind me."

His sister Isabella had exhausted every possible method to become Professor Klein's student. Yet the professor's answer never changed: No.

It had become a sore point for the entire Valentine family.
###Chapter 35

Oliver Valentine leaned lazily against the corridor wall, absently flipping a coin between his slender fingers. Sunlight streamed through the glass windows, casting sharp contours across his handsome features.

"Ethan," he suddenly spoke, his voice laced with playful resentment, "Why must you be so damn perfect? Now Professor Klein won't even look at anyone else."

Ethan Sullivan stood by the window, his expression unreadable behind gold-rimmed glasses. He adjusted them with a slight smirk. "Natural talent."

"..."

Oliver nearly crushed the coin in his grip.

They'd grown up together, yet Ethan had always been steps ahead. No matter how hard Oliver tried, he could never catch up to his childhood friend.

Eventually, he'd stopped trying.

Through the classroom door's small window, Oliver's gaze settled on Evelyn Laurent. The young woman sat absorbed in her exam, sunlight gilding her silhouette.

"Your fiancée," Oliver whistled low, "is going places. Professor Klein doesn't take just anyone."

"Hmm."

Ethan's response was glacial in its indifference.

Oliver raised an eyebrow, lowering his voice. "Still hung up on your unrequited love? Honestly, Evelyn's gorgeous, and she is your fiancée—"

"The engagement won't stand."

Ethan's interruption came like an ice blade.

"We'll dissolve it eventually."

Oliver blinked, then shook his head. Ethan's polished exterior hid an unshakable stubbornness. That genteel charm was merely armor.

No one truly reached his heart.

Oliver's eyes returned to Evelyn. Sunlight sculpted her profile into something breathtaking, her writing hand steady as stone.

"If you're not interested," Oliver suddenly grinned, mischief dancing in his eyes, "mind if I pursue her?"

"No."

Ethan turned sharply, his gaze razor-sharp.

Oliver laughed at his reaction. "The Valentines and Laurents are equals. She wouldn't be marrying beneath her."

"I said no."

Ethan's voice brooked no argument. His assessing stare swept Oliver before adding disdainfully, "Besides, you're too old."

"What?!" Oliver's eyes widened. "We're the same age! How am I old?"

Ethan adjusted his glasses with aristocratic grace. "I'm better looking."

Oliver clutched his chest as if struck.

Before he could retort, his phone rang sharply. "Isabella Valentine" flashed on the screen.

"Brother!" Isabella's shrill voice pierced through. "Evelyn actually got into Harvard? Ethan must've pulled strings! That country bumpkin could never—"

"Isabella," Oliver cut in sternly, "Professor Klein doesn't play favorites. Evelyn earned her spot."
###Chapter 36

"Oliver, how could you do this to me!"

Isabella Valentine's shrill voice pierced the air. Even her flawless makeup couldn't conceal the fury twisting her delicate features.

Oliver Valentine's gaze turned icy. "Enough."

He had never spoken to his sister with such chilling detachment before. "If you want Professor Klein's approval, earn it through merit—not underhanded schemes!"

Isabella froze, tears welling in her eyes.

The cold dismissal in his voice felt like a knife to her heart. She slammed the phone down, tears streaming uncontrollably.

Underhanded schemes? She had pulled all-nighters for that physics competition, worked equations until her fingers cramped. All she wanted was to leverage family connections to get closer to Professor Klein—and her own brother shamed her for it?

Her nails dug into her palms. She clenched her jaw. She would prove to everyone she was a hundred times better than Evelyn Laurent!

——

In the examination hall, Evelyn set down her pen and handed the test to Dr. Evans. "Headmaster, I've finished."

Professor Klein and three other faculty members immediately gathered around. Ethan Sullivan and Oliver Valentine entered just then, their gazes locking onto the composed young woman.

Evelyn flexed her wrist slightly, watching calmly as the professors graded her paper.

"This can't be!"

Dr. Evans' hands trembled as he stared at the perfect score. He looked up at Evelyn, too stunned to speak.

Oliver stepped forward, scanning the immaculately written answers. Every question was flawless, even the most obscure concepts addressed without error.

Had he not witnessed it himself, he might have suspected cheating.

"Well? Isn't my protégée brilliant?" Professor Klein beamed, eyes crinkling with pride.

Though they'd expected excellence, the other three professors were equally awed by the perfect score.

"Astonishing!" Dr. Evans murmured, a sheen of sweat on his brow.

Professor Klein stroked his beard smugly. "Good thing I recognized her talent and admitted her directly."

"Wise decision, Professor!" Dr. Evans nodded fervently, scrambling to process her enrollment. He dreaded to imagine the global frenzy if Evelyn had taken standard entrance exams—every top university would have fought to recruit her.

When the official seal stamped the documents, Dr. Evans exhaled in relief. This prodigy now belonged to Harvard University.

He had a feeling—Evelyn Laurent would become a legend on campus, just like Ethan Sullivan.
###Chapter 37

September sunlight bathed the grand entrance of Harvard University.

New student orientation day buzzed with activity. Cars lined the streets as young faces, accompanied by parents, dragged suitcases filled with dreams.

Sophia Lowell stood out in the crowd in her white dress. Her wavy hair fluttered in the breeze, her flawless makeup accentuating her elegance.

"Truly the nation's top institution," Vincent Lowell murmured, gazing at the majestic gates.

Margaret Hill held her daughter's arm, pride shining in her eyes. "Sophia is now a Harvard student."

Sophia smiled faintly. "Don't worry, Mom and Dad. I won't waste this opportunity."

Entering Harvard as an exchange student marked a new chapter in her life. Graduates from here were destined for greatness.

Three months had passed since the incident. The Lowell family's injuries had healed completely. Sophia regained her poised demeanor, drawing admiring glances.

Though expelled from The Grand Hyatt, Vincent avoided further retaliation. He lost his title as Cloudhaven's wealthiest man, his fortune diminished.

"Sophia, the family's future rests on you," Vincent whispered. "Whether we reclaim our status or establish ourselves in Boston depends entirely on you."

The past three months had been spent grooming Sophia relentlessly—etiquette, talents, even dossiers on Boston's elite families.

"I understand," Sophia replied demurely.

Her parents nodded in approval. This was their trueborn daughter, refined despite seventeen years away.

Unlike that Evelyn Laurent...

Vincent's expression darkened at the thought of his adopted daughter. The humiliation of being publicly ejected from The Grand Hyatt still burned. Though spared further consequences, he blamed Evelyn entirely.

"Evelyn Laurent!" Brandon Lowell suddenly shouted.

A taxi pulled up at the gates.

Evelyn stepped out in simple black athletic wear, a document folder in hand. Sunlight illuminated her bare face, fresh and unadorned.

She had declined her brothers' offer to accompany her. As a newcomer, she preferred to avoid drawing attention.
###Chapter 38

The sunlight was bright at the entrance of Harvard University.

Evelyn Laurent had just stepped out of a taxi when she heard Brandon Lowell's grating voice.

Her brows furrowed as her icy gaze swept toward the sound.

Fate had a cruel sense of humor.

Vincent Lowell curled his lips into a sneer upon seeing her arrive by cab. Margaret Hill rushed forward with mocking sweetness. "Well, if it isn't Evelyn Laurent, the girl who landed herself a sugar daddy. Still taking taxis?"

"Did your benefactor dump you?" She dramatically covered her mouth. "Country girls will always be country girls. Even in designer clothes, they'll never fit in."

Brandon sidled up, his face twisted in disdain. "Look at how she's dressed. Trying to seduce another rich heir?"

Evelyn uttered a single word through clenched teeth. "Leave."

She had no patience for these fools.

"Disgraceful!" Vincent barked. "You didn't even take the college entrance exams. What right do you have to be at Harvard?"

A crowd began to gather around them.

Evelyn flexed her wrist, knuckles cracking ominously. "Seems I didn't hit you hard enough last time."

Sophia Lowell suddenly stepped forward with righteous indignation. "Evelyn! This is Harvard, not some back alley for you to brawl in!"

"My sister is a Harvard freshman," Brandon boasted. "Know your place and get lost!"

Whispers rippled through the onlookers.

"Kids these days..."
"Pretty face, but always looking for shortcuts..."
"I heard she didn't even take the exams..."

The murmurs grew louder.

Sophia lifted her chin, looking down her nose. "Evelyn, I suggest you learn some humility."

She raised her voice deliberately. "Harvard isn't for people like you."

A sudden commotion erupted at the back of the crowd.

A black Maybach glided to a stop before the university gates.
###Chapter 39

At the gates of Harvard University, Sophia Lowell stood in an elegant maxi dress, her hair fluttering in the breeze—the very picture of a refined young lady from an aristocratic family. Her gentle, coaxing voice contrasted sharply with Evelyn Laurent, who wore a cheap T-shirt and was the target of the crowd's scorn.

"Are you saying I'm the one causing trouble here?" Evelyn scanned the crowd, her lips curling into a cold smirk. "Who was it that started hurling insults? 'Country bumpkin'? 'Ill-bred'? 'Man-stealer'?"

With each word, her gaze grew sharper.

She took slow, deliberate steps toward Sophia. "You claim you have an acceptance letter? Show it to me."

An oppressive aura radiated from her, her eyes as sharp as blades.

Sophia instinctively took half a step back, forcing herself to stand her ground. "Evelyn Laurent, what do you think you're doing?"

Vincent Lowell and the other two immediately shielded Sophia, their voices harsh. "You wouldn't dare hit someone right at Harvard's gates!"

"Since when do I need to pick a place to slap you?"

Before the words had fully left her mouth, Evelyn's hand lashed out—

SMACK!

The crisp sound of the slap echoed across the campus entrance.

Vincent staggered back, clutching his face, his ears ringing. He stared at Evelyn in disbelief, never imagining she would actually strike him in public.

The crowd fell dead silent. The gossiping women shrank back, terrified of drawing her wrath.

"Evelyn Laurent, you—"

Brandon Lowell barely got a word out before another sharp slap landed on his face.

"Idiots, the lot of you." Evelyn flicked her wrist in disgust. "You just had to ask for it, didn't you?"

For the past three months, she'd been occupied with far more important matters—these clowns weren't worth her time. But if they insisted on provoking her, she'd happily oblige.

Sophia watched as her father and brother were struck, a fleeting glint of satisfaction flashing in her eyes. Then, her lashes fluttered, her voice trembling with feigned distress. "Evelyn, they raised you for seventeen years! How could you do this?"

She deliberately raised her voice, ensuring the crowd heard every word.

Just as she intended, the onlookers erupted.

"Ungrateful wretch!"
"Such cruelty at her age!"
"She must've seduced her way into everything!"

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial. In a flash, she closed the distance between them—

CRACK!

The force of the slap sent Sophia sprawling to the ground.

Her ears buzzed, her cheek burning with searing pain. Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth as she clutched her face, the picture of pitiful misery.
###Chapter 40

"Sophia!"

Margaret's piercing scream shattered the air as she lunged toward her daughter like a madwoman.

Evelyn seized her by the hair and delivered two sharp slaps across her face.

Crack! Crack!

The crisp sound of impact echoed through the grand hall.

Margaret staggered and collapsed, blood gushing from her mouth.

Her newly fitted dentures went flying again, clattering across the marble floor.

The crowd recoiled in horror, some covering their eyes.

"Stop this!"

Three young men pushed through the spectators, faces contorted with rage.

They scrambled to help Sophia up.

"Have you lost your mind, Evelyn?"

The leader clenched his fists until the knuckles turned white.

"After everything Sophia's done for you, this is how you repay her?"

Evelyn's lips curled into an icy smile.

"Done for me?"

Her gaze swept over them like a blade.

"Such kindness is more than I can bear."

"You ungrateful wretch!"

Another young man spat through gritted teeth.

"Seventeen years under the Lowells' roof, and this is what they get?"

Vincent trembled as he stood, disappointment etched across his face.

"Evelyn, you've—"

"Silence!"

Her command cut through the air like a whip.

Alone at the center, Evelyn stood encircled by a sea of scornful stares.

Whispers slithered through the crowd.

"No upbringing..."

"Vicious..."

"Backstabber..."

Each word stabbed deeper than the last.

Her nails bit into her palms.

Chest heaving, her eyes burned crimson.

"Vincent."

Her voice could freeze hellfire.

"You forfeited the right to lecture me."

"I'm your father!"

Vincent shook with fury.

"Father?"

Evelyn's sudden laughter made spines shiver.

"Fine. If I'm truly this monstrous..."

She slowly raised her hand, pointing at Vincent.

"Call the police."

"Let them judge who's in the wrong."

"Do you dare, Vincent Lowell?"
###Chapter 41

Evelyn's accusation struck Vincent like a dagger to his weakest spot.

Vincent's face darkened instantly, his eyes flashing with malice.

Before he could speak, the three boys beside Sophia erupted. "Call the police then! We're not afraid!"

Sophia trembled at the mention of police. "No! You can't!" she shrieked, unaware of how shrill her voice sounded.

Her scream cut through the noisy crowd like a knife.

The three boys stared at her in disbelief.

Realizing her slip, Sophia quickly lowered her head and sniffled. "She's still my sister... I don't want her to go to jail."

Vincent's voice was icy. "Family scandals shouldn't be aired in public."

Evelyn suddenly burst into laughter.

Her eyes reddened as her nails dug into her palms. "Is it really about family honor? Or are you just guilty?"

Vincent stiffened before scowling. "Nonsense!"

The crowd exchanged uneasy glances.

"Evelyn, I know you want to go to college too..." Sophia forced tears, enduring the pain in her face. "I'll give you my exchange student spot. Okay?"

She shakily extended the folder in her hands. "You can have anything you want!"

"Sophia! Are you insane?"
"You worked so hard for this!"
"She didn't even take the exams. Why should she get it?"

The three boys protested immediately.

Sophia gave a strained smile. "It's fine... I can try again next year..."

Evelyn watched the farce coldly.

Then she reached out and grabbed the folder. "Sure."

Sophia froze.

She instinctively tried to pull back, but Evelyn's grip was ironclad.

"Didn't you say you'd give it to me?" Evelyn smirked mockingly. "Having second thoughts?"

Sophia's face paled.

This spot was something she'd schemed tirelessly to obtain. There was no way she'd actually surrender it.

But now, under everyone's watchful eyes...
###Chapter 42

Sophia Lowell's fingers trembled as the document folder slipped from her grasp.

Her eyes welled up with tears. "If Sister wants it, she can take it," she whispered meekly.

Her pitiful demeanor made Evelyn Laurent look like some villainous bully stealing her prized possession.

"You—" The boy beside Sophia started forward angrily.

Evelyn's sharp glare froze him in place.

"Evelyn Laurent!" Margaret Hill shrieked. "Have you no shame? Stealing from your own sister!"

Ignoring the outburst, Evelyn calmly opened the folder and scanned its contents.

"Aha," she sneered. "An exchange student position at Harvard."

She held the acceptance letter between two fingers with visible disdain.

"That's Harvard's exchange program!" A red-faced boy protested. "Do you know how competitive that is?"

"Yeah," another chimed in. "Better than someone who couldn't even get into Harvard!"

Laughter rippled through the crowd.

The corners of Sophia's lips twitched upward briefly before she resumed her tearful act. "Does Sister think this opportunity is beneath her?"

One side of her face remained swollen, her tears poised to fall—a sight designed to evoke sympathy.

But those glistening eyes held unmistakable calculation.

Though not as prestigious as full admission, Harvard's exchange program remained many students' dream.

Sophia intended to humiliate Evelyn publicly, to make her writhe under everyone's scorn.

Evelyn noted her smug expression.

With a flick of her wrist, she tossed the letter to the ground. "Indeed. It's beneath me."

Sophia scrambled to retrieve it, her voice suddenly shrill. "You may look down on me, but don't insult Harvard!"

Her dramatic delivery drew stares.

"Apologize!" Three boys demanded in unison.

Evelyn crossed her arms, gaze razor-sharp. "Acting so high and mighty—one might mistake you for an actual Harvard student."

She stepped closer, her voice dropping to an icy timbre. "Why not get into Harvard properly? Don't you like it?"

Each word struck like a dagger, piercing Sophia's insecurities.
###Chapter 43

Sophia Lowell's face turned deathly pale.

Her lips trembled, but no words came out.

Evelyn Laurent curled her lips in disdain. "Seems like it's not that you look down on it—you just can't reach it."

Mocking laughter rippled through the crowd.

Sophia clenched her skirt, her nails digging into her palms.

Her proudest achievement as an exchange student had become a joke in Evelyn's presence.

"You worthless trash!" Margaret Hill shrieked hysterically. "You couldn't even touch the gates of Harvard!"

Brandon Lowell chimed in, "Yeah! How dare a country bumpkin laugh at my sister?"

Evelyn's eyes turned icy.

She moved like lightning.

A sharp slap echoed across the campus entrance.

Three boys lunged at her—only to be kicked back with brutal efficiency.

They crashed to the ground, howling in pain.

"Cross me again, and you'll regret it."

Evelyn turned toward the university gates, her silhouette sharp as a blade.

Sophia lay sprawled on the pavement, her white dress smeared with dirt.

Her eyes burned with venom as she stared at Evelyn's retreating figure.

She refused to believe Evelyn could enter.

The crowd held its breath.

Evelyn calmly produced an admission letter—the embossed school crest gleaming under the sunlight.

"A special admission letter?!" someone gasped.

Sophia froze as if struck by lightning.

Her scream pierced the air. "Impossible!"

The crowd erupted.

Harvard's special admissions were reserved for once-in-a-generation geniuses.

Business cards were thrust toward Evelyn from all directions.

"Miss, let's get acquainted!"

"I'm from Evergrande Group—"

The Lowell family stood rooted in shock.

Sophia trembled violently, her vision blurring.

She finally understood—Evelyn had planned this all along.

A bloodcurdling scream cut off abruptly.

Sophia collapsed like a felled tree.

The commotion at the gates faded into the distance.

Evelyn strode into the campus without a backward glance.

The chaos behind her ceased to exist.
###Chapter 44

Evelyn Laurent walked straight through the crowd, ignoring the sycophantic gazes fixed on her.

The wail of an ambulance pierced the sky as it carried the unconscious Sophia Lowell away.

Outside the school gates, Ethan Sullivan tapped his slender fingers against the window of his black Maybach.

His eyes darkened as he watched the ambulance disappear into the distance.

The fools of the Lowell family had no idea what they were playing with.

Daring to provoke Evelyn right under his nose?

It was time they learned their lesson.

——

The sharp scent of disinfectant filled the hospital air.

Sophia lay on the bed, her face wrapped in bandages.

A perforated eardrum. Mild concussion.

Vincent Lowell and the others were also bruised, their expressions grim.

"That bitch!" Sophia slammed her fist against the mattress, then winced in pain.

She couldn't understand it.

How had Evelyn, who couldn't even get into a third-rate college, secured an acceptance letter from Harvard?

"Don't upset yourself, darling," Margaret Hill soothed, pressing her hand down. "I'll make sure justice is served."

Sophia suddenly grabbed her mother's wrist. "Mom, Evelyn must have cheated!"

Vincent's eyes lit up. "Exactly! Someone was backing her at The Grand Hyatt that day."

The three exchanged glances, their lips curling into venomous smiles.

The door swung open as three young men hobbled in, supporting each other.

"Seniors..." Sophia's eyes instantly welled with tears.

"Don't worry, Sophia," the leader said indignantly. "Harvard has semester exams. She'll be exposed sooner or later!"

"Exactly!" another chimed in. "Someone like her, who got in through connections, will be weeded out in the first round."

Sophia's tears turned into a fragile smile as she lowered her gaze demurely. "Thank you, Seniors..."

The trio burned with righteous fervor.

"We'll dig up her secrets!"

"We'll make sure she doesn't last a day at Harvard!"

As they marched out, Sophia watched their retreating backs, a cold smirk twisting her lips.

This time, Evelyn, I'll ruin you completely.
###Chapter 45

Zhou Zhuangfei pushed open the door to find Ye Chen leaning against the window, cigarette in hand.

"The safehouse is ready," Zhou said, rubbing his palms together, sweat beading at his temples. "Shall we take a look now?"

Ye Chen stubbed out his cigarette, lips curling into a smirk.

"Efficient as always, Fei." He clapped Zhou's shoulder. "Consider us partners from now on."

Zhou bobbed his head obsequiously. "Just call me Old Zhou. In Dongzhou, you need only ask."

Jun Wuhui crouched in the corner polishing a blade. He glanced up. "Boss, take me along this time. Let me see how things are done."

Ye Chen eyed the glaring sunlight outside. "Fine. Go with Fei."

Three black SUVs idled in the courtyard. Zhou personally opened the middle vehicle's door. "After you."

The convoy wound through downtown before turning onto a tree-lined lane. At its end stood a three-story villa, its pale facade half-hidden by bamboo groves.

"Discreet." Ye Chen surveyed the property approvingly. "You've outdone yourself."

Zhou produced a brass key. "There's an escape tunnel in the basement. Back gate leads straight to the mountain trails." He lowered his voice. "Things are tense lately. Be careful."

Dongfang Xin'er waited under the portico, suitcase in hand. Sunlight filtering through bamboo leaves dappled her face with shifting patterns, breathtaking in their effect.

"Wuhui." Ye Chen stopped the departing youth. "Remember the rules."

The boy flashed a grin, canines glinting. "Wouldn't dream of embarrassing you, Boss!"

As engine noise faded, Ye Chen turned to find Dongfang staring blankly at the second-floor balcony.

"Like what you see?" He took her luggage.

A soft hum of agreement. Her lavender qipao cinched a waist slender enough to span with two hands.

The villa's interior was minimalist. Ye Chen pushed open the master bedroom door—fresh white roses adorned the nightstand. His gaze darkened. Suddenly he seized her wrist.

"That night..."

Amid the roses' scent, her lashes fluttered. "I chose it."

Ye Chen slammed her against the wall. The qipao's slit revealed a flash of pale thigh. His Adam's apple bobbed.

"I'll make you Dongzhou's most revered woman." His teeth grazed her earlobe. "Anyone touches you, I'll wipe out their bloodline."

Bamboo shadows danced beyond the window. Dongfang tilted her face upward. A single tear traced her cheek.

"Just stay alive."
###Chapter 46

Vincent Lowell's pupils constricted sharply.

Evelyn Laurent's cold, distant face flashed before his eyes.

He shook his head violently, as if trying to dislodge something filthy.

"Darling!" Margaret Hill shrieked, clutching her face. "That bitch Evelyn must have sent someone to attack us!"

Vincent sneered. "Is she even capable?"

He checked his phone, his gaze darkening.

"If she'd really climbed the social ladder, wouldn't she have a private car by now?"

The hospital room air turned frigid.

Vincent's eyes swept over the three bruised boys before locking onto Sophia Lowell.

"Sophia." His voice was glacial. "Who have you offended recently?"

Sophia trembled.

She'd never seen her father look at her like this—like she was nothing but trouble.

"I didn't..." Her voice was barely audible.

Vincent snorted and pressed the call button.

When the doctors rushed in, he was carefully examining Brandon Lowell's injuries, ignoring his daughter in the corner.

Sophia's fingers dug into the bed rail.

The bruises on her face burned, but the pain in her chest was worse.

"Evelyn Laurent..." She gritted her teeth, nails cutting into her palms.

Her phone screen flickered.

Several messages were sent in silence.

——

The sun glared mercilessly on opening ceremony day.

Evelyn stood in the Physics Department line, an empty space forming around her.

Whispers coiled around her like venomous snakes.

"That's her..."
"I heard..."
"Disgusting..."

Her expression remained blank as she flipped open her notebook, pen carving deep grooves into the paper.

Under a distant tree, Sophia touched up her makeup in a compact mirror, lips curling into a smirk.
###Chapter 47

Physics students clustered in small groups, their gazes flickering toward Evelyn Laurent in the corner.

They kept a deliberate distance, as if she carried some contagious disease.

Sophia Lowell stood at the center of the crowd, basking in attention.

Though she wore a mask, the smugness in her eyes was unmistakable.

She toyed with a strand of hair, her icy stare fixed on Evelyn, who sat alone.

"Evelyn Laurent..." she sneered inwardly. "This is what happens when you cross me."

Three boys hovered around her like loyal hounds, whispering to those nearby.

"I heard she didn't even take the college entrance exam..."

"Must've gotten in through shady connections..."

"Tch. Look at her acting all aloof..."

The murmurs slithered through the crowd like venomous snakes.

Sophia coughed lightly, feigning concern. "Don't say that. Evelyn just... doesn't know any better."

She glanced at Evelyn, only to find her still staring at her phone, fingers flying across the keyboard.

Her research with Professor Benjamin Klein had been incredibly fruitful these past few days.

"It's Ethan Sullivan!"

"Ethan Sullivan is here!"

A burst of shrieks shattered her focus.

On the stage, Ethan stood in a crisp suit, his gold-rimmed glasses lending him an air of refined gentleness.

His gaze swept over the crowd before settling on Evelyn.

The screams intensified.

"He's looking this way!"

"Oh my god, he smiled at me!"

Evelyn frowned and lifted her head, meeting Ethan's eyes for a brief moment.

Without a flicker of expression, she looked back down at her phone.
###Chapter 48

Evelyn Laurent averted her eyes from the dazzling figure on stage.

She rolled her eyes internally. The man was utterly ostentatious.

Ethan Sullivan caught her glance instantly, reading the disdain in her gaze with unsettling clarity.

"..."

His expression remained impassive as he looked away.

He'd only noticed the Physics Department students deliberately distancing themselves from her and wondered if she needed assistance.

Yet all he received was her contempt.

Then again, with Evelyn's capabilities, isolation was inevitable. But anyone foolish enough to bully her? The entire Physics Department combined wouldn't stand a chance.

Ethan lowered his lashes, masking the flicker in his eyes as he picked up the microphone to deliver his speech.

The moment he stepped onstage, screams erupted—only to die into absolute silence when he began speaking.

Evelyn's thoughts scattered. She half-heartedly listened to a few lines.

The usual motivational platitudes for students. Dull beyond measure.

While she remained indifferent, others stared at Ethan with blazing intensity, their eyes brimming with fervor.

Especially Sophia Lowell.

Her gaze clung to the stage, shimmering with awe and infatuation.

She recognized him—the man who'd captivated her at the gala!

So this was Ethan Sullivan, the youngest business prodigy in the country.

In person, he was a hundred times more striking than in photographs.

If she could just earn his favor...

Sophia's fists clenched unconsciously, her stare so intense it could weave silk from the air.

Ethan remained unperturbed by the sea of hungry gazes.

When his speech concluded, thunderous applause erupted.

He bowed gracefully and exited the stage.

The moment he turned, the warmth in his eyes vanished.

Those brazen, coveting stares sickened him.

After the dean's address, students returned to their departments with their advisors.

Evelyn walked amid the Physics Department group, classmates maintaining deliberate distance around her.

Isabella Valentine was among them.

Arms crossed, her coldly beautiful face etched with scorn, she strode toward Evelyn.

"Evelyn Laurent, seems you're not exactly thriving in the Physics Department," Isabella sneered. "Drop out now before you fall behind and embarrass Professor Klein."

She refused to believe Evelyn had earned Benjamin Klein's respect through merit.

This impostor needed to be exposed.

Evelyn gave her a dismissive glance. "Even if I left, Professor Klein would never waste his time on someone like you."
###Chapter 49

"Evelyn Laurent!"

Isabella Valentine trembled with rage, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Evelyn's careless words sliced through Isabella's carefully maintained pride like razor blades.

How infuriating!

This was nothing but blatant bragging!

"Just you wait. One day I'll rip off that mask of yours!"

Isabella clenched her fists, eyes burning with fury.

Evelyn didn't even glance at her. "You're not worthy," she said coldly before walking away, her posture straight as a pine.

Isabella stood rooted, staring at Evelyn's retreating figure, her lips pressed into a bloodless line.

Evelyn knew exactly how to hit her where it hurt.

Every word was a poisoned needle stabbing her heart.

That "not worthy" comment made her blood boil.

Taking a deep breath, Isabella hurried after her.

Sophia Lowell witnessed the entire scene.

Her eyes lit up, a calculating smile curling her lips.

She'd been searching for an opportunity to get close to Isabella. Now Evelyn had handed it to her on a silver platter.

In the physics classroom, Sophia scanned the room. Confirming Evelyn's absence, she sidled up to Isabella.

"Mind if I sit here?"

Sophia flashed a saccharine smile, her voice dripping with sweetness.

Isabella, still seething, shot her a frosty look and stayed silent.

"You and Evelyn seem to have some... misunderstanding?"

Sophia lowered her voice, feigning concern.

"None of your business."

Isabella's sharp retort made heads turn.

Sophia's smile faltered but quickly recovered.

"My apologies. Evelyn grew up in the countryside. She's always been... uncivilized."

She paused before adding, "She skips classes constantly and has terrible grades. If she offended you, please don't take it personally."

Her words were carefully crafted—appearing gracious while subtly disparaging Evelyn.

Isabella frowned. "You know Evelyn?"

"Of course."

Sophia sighed dramatically. "Her parents are country bumpkins. Her brothers are uneducated too. That's why she's so rebellious."

Isabella stared at her like she was an idiot.

This girl must be delusional.

Evelyn's family were country folk?

What a joke!

The Laurents were one of the most powerful families in the city.

Clearly Sophia had no clue about Evelyn's true background.

Otherwise she'd never dare speak like this.

"Please don't hold it against her. We're all classmates after all."

Sophia continued playing the saint.

"Why are you defending Evelyn?"

"Yeah, why should we tolerate that wild brat?"

"Someone like her should be expelled!"

"It's embarrassing sharing a class with her."

The surrounding students eagerly chimed in.

Sophia hid her glee behind a mask of concern.

"Don't say that. She's just... brutally honest."
###Chapter 50

Evelyn Laurent had just reached the classroom door when she heard Sophia Lowell's deliberately pitiful voice.

"Please don't misunderstand my sister... She's just very straightforward..."

Sophia stood by the lectern, her eyes slightly reddened, putting on an innocent, vulnerable act.

The surrounding students whispered among themselves, casting disdainful glances at Evelyn.

"I heard she bullies her sister just because her family's rich..."

"How can someone like her be student council president..."

Sophia lowered her head, but a smug smirk secretly curled her lips.

Suddenly, an icy gaze made her freeze.

Isabella Valentine leaned against the window, her slender fingers tapping the desk, eyes sharp as blades.

"I-Isabella..." Sophia's voice trembled.

Isabella let out a cold laugh. "Had enough of your performance?"

The classroom instantly fell silent.

Sophia turned pale. "I don't know what you mean—"

Bang!

Isabella slammed the desk and stood, her red lips curling in mockery. "Stop pretending. You think I'm stupid?"

She strode toward Sophia, her heels clicking sharply against the floor.

"Trying to use others as your weapons?" Isabella whispered in her ear. "You're not worthy."

Sophia staggered back, nearly falling.

"Get out." Isabella straightened, looking down at her. "Try this act again and you'll regret it."

The classroom was deathly quiet.

Sophia covered her face and fled, her lackeys scrambling after her.

"Isabella Valentine! That was too much!" a girl shouted angrily.

Isabella casually adjusted her cuffs. "Want to defend her?"

The girl immediately fell silent.

Evelyn stood at the doorway, watching thoughtfully.

Isabella noticed her gaze and scoffed. "What are you looking at?"

Evelyn smiled slightly. "Thank you."

"Don't flatter yourself." Isabella turned away. "I just hate being used."

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting a golden glow on Isabella's delicate profile.

For the first time, Evelyn thought this young heiress might not be so bad after all.
###Chapter 51

The classroom fell deathly silent.

The gossiping girls turned ghostly pale, their lips trembling uncontrollably.

Who in the upper echelons didn't know the name Isabella Valentine, the Valentine family's prized heiress?

"W-we're so sorry, Miss Valentine..."

"It was an accident..."

They bowed frantically, beads of cold sweat forming on their foreheads.

Isabella swept them with an icy gaze. "Get lost," she murmured.

Her quiet command froze everyone in place.

Outside in the hallway, Sophia Lowell collided with Evelyn Laurent leaning against the wall.

"You've been waiting to watch the show, haven't you?" Sophia's eyes burned red with rage.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow and yanked off Sophia's face mask.

Sophia's shriek pierced the corridor.

Her swollen, crimson cheeks were exposed—resembling a pig stung by hornets.

"Evelyn Laurent, how dare you!"

Her lackeys fumbled to offer a replacement mask, but Evelyn's glare pinned them in place.

"Try me again."

Evelyn tapped Sophia's shoulder with each word, the pressure like knife points.

Sophia's knees buckled, nearly sending her crashing to the floor.

Inside the classroom, students automatically cleared a path as Evelyn strode to the front row.

The moment she sat down, nearby classmates scattered like frightened birds.

The entire front section emptied instantly.

Evelyn opened her notebook, the scratch of her pen filling the silence.

Those complex equations and experimental data held far more appeal than these tedious people.
###Chapter 52

The winter snow still clung to the streets of Versailles as Lobsang Dhondup stood by the window of his residence, gazing at the distant palace walls. A month ago, he had arrived full of hope. Now, he would leave empty-handed.

"Chancellor, Prince Liam still refuses to see us," his aide murmured.

Lobsang's fingers tapped rhythmically against the windowsill. He had already investigated Liam Chamberlain's lucrative enterprises in secret. The workshops generating mountains of gold made his eyes burn with envy—especially the paper mill, rumored to produce sheets finer than those of the noble houses.

"Prepare my horse. I'll go myself."

At the gates of Windsor Palace, Marcus Valerius blocked his path with practiced courtesy. "His Highness is unwell and cannot receive guests."

Lobsang produced a flawless piece of mutton-fat jade from his sleeve. "Inform him the Bavarian envoy departs tomorrow and wishes to bid farewell."

Half a cup of tea later, he was finally admitted to the grand hall.

Liam reclined on a divan, idly turning a white jade chess piece between his fingers. "Must you be so persistent, Chancellor?"

"Your Highness jests." Lobsang's eyes swept the room—every furnishing a treasure, even the ambergris incense worth its weight in gold. "I've long admired your culture. Before leaving, I hoped to purchase some of your exquisite paper."

Liam chuckled and snapped the chess piece onto the board. "The eastern market has plenty of paper shops."

"Rumors say your mill uses unique techniques—"

"Chancellor." Liam sat up abruptly, his gaze sharp as a blade. "We're both men of the world. Did you think the Crown was unaware of the noble houses smuggling salt and iron to you?"

Lobsang's pulse jumped, but his expression remained smooth. "Your Highness misunderstands—"

"Enough!" Liam waved a hand. "I sold you grain at low prices precisely to cut off their profits. If you were wise, you'd know which alliance serves you better."

The air in the hall turned brittle.

Lobsang narrowed his eyes. "Your Highness isn't afraid of our armies—"

"Ha!" Liam's laughter cut him off. "Tens of thousands of soldiers? You can't even feed them without smuggling." He rose, looking down at the envoy. "Remember—in Versailles, even a dragon must coil and a tiger must crouch."

Lobsang's face darkened. He stood abruptly. "Prince Liam flaunts his power boldly! We shall see!"

"Don't trouble yourself to see him out." Liam flicked his fingers lazily. Only after Lobsang stormed away did he address Marcus emerging from behind the screen. "Have him watched. Ensure he doesn't cause trouble before leaving."

Marcus bowed but hesitated. "My lord, provoking him like this—"

Liam spun the chess piece on his fingertip. "I want him rattled. Men make mistakes when they're desperate."

Outside, the last rays of sunset painted Versailles' sky crimson.
###Chapter 53

Ethan Sullivan stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows of his penthouse office, slender fingers swiping rapidly across his tablet. The Harvard University forum page refreshed continuously, each malicious post about Evelyn Laurent like a knife to his eyes.

His phone vibrated violently on the desk.

Messages flooded the group chat titled "Princess Evelyn Fan Club."

Alexander Langley: "List is ready. None of them are getting away."

Sebastian Langley: "@Ethan Sullivan Some fiancé you are. Didn’t even know Evelyn was being bullied?"

Julian Langley: "Cease-and-desist letters are drafted. They’ll be served by morning."

Nathaniel Langley: "Dissection lab could use fresh specimens."

Theodore Langley: "I’m heading to Harvard right now. Try and stop me!"

Ethan massaged his temples. The cringe-worthy group name could only be one person’s doing.

"Working on it," he replied tersely.

Harrison Whitmore had been the first to flag the forum scandal. Ethan immediately alerted the Langley family—the resulting roar through the phone nearly shattered his eardrum.

As night fell, Ethan changed into casual wear, pulling on a baseball cap and face mask. His black Mercedes glided discreetly onto Harvard’s campus.

He’d already contacted Professor Benjamin Klein. Evelyn had been holed up in the lab all week, completely unaware she’d become the university’s hottest gossip topic.

Knowing her temper, she’d probably hack the forum servers if she discovered the slander.

The corner of Ethan’s mouth lifted as he parked outside the science building.

Evelyn approached from the dormitory direction, backpack slung over one shoulder, ponytail swaying with each step.

"Evelyn."

She turned, studying him for two beats. "What?"

"Dinner. Your treat." He removed his sunglasses.

"Busy." She pivoted away.

Ethan caught up in three strides. "Your parents and Dominic are waiting."

Evelyn froze. "Dom’s back?"

It had been months since all six brothers left. Though gifts arrived daily, nothing compared to seeing them in person.

"Car’s here. I cleared it with Professor Klein."

Evelyn typed a quick confirmation text before reluctantly yanking the car door open.

The engine roared as the black sedan dissolved into the night.
###Chapter 54

A shadowy figure emerged from the rustling trees. A girl lurked halfway behind the trunk, clutching her phone with icy eyes fixed on the departing luxury car.

Her fingers flew across the screen. Several covert photos were instantly transmitted.

Evelyn Laurent remained oblivious. She leaned back in the car seat, eyelids heavy with exhaustion. Ethan Sullivan hesitated, then silently started the engine.

Inside The Grand Hyatt's private dining room, Victoria Langley and Richard Langley frantically refreshed Harvard University's forum. Every supportive comment they posted for their daughter was instantly drowned in a flood of vitriol.

Dominic Langley's expression darkened as he meticulously recorded each malicious username in a notebook.

The door hinges creaked.

All three froze, hastily pocketing their phones as they turned toward the entrance.

"Evelyn!" Victoria rushed forward, enveloping her daughter in a fierce embrace. Her eyes glistened as fingertips traced Evelyn's gaunt cheeks. "You've lost so much weight."

"I'm fine, Mom." Evelyn forced a weak smile.

They seated her at the head of the table, her father and brothers immediately showering her with concern. The family carefully avoided mentioning the forum scandal, maintaining their cheerful facade.

Victoria discreetly studied her daughter's expression. Seeing no awareness of the rumors, she exhaled slightly in relief.

When Ethan returned from his phone call, the room was filled with laughter.

Meanwhile, Harvard's forum exploded.

The hashtag #EvelynLaurentSugarDaddyProof trended at the top. The limited-edition BMW in the photos drew venomous comments.

"Gold diggers don't belong at Harvard."
"That wrapped-up sugar daddy must be some decrepit old man."
"Expel her immediately!"

The digital lynching intensified.

Back at The Grand Hyatt, Victoria kept Evelyn entertained with anecdotes. Seeing the faint smile on her daughter's lips, the three men exchanged relieved glances.

Unbeknownst to them, the university president's office remained brightly lit. Harrison Whitmore stared at his computer screen, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"This requires immediate action," he said gravely into the phone. "Things are escalating dangerously."

Outside, the night thickened like ink. A greater storm was gathering.
###Chapter 55

Victoria Langley was gently comforting Evelyn Laurent when the fan group chat for "Princess Evelyn" exploded with activity.

Theodore Langley spammed the chat relentlessly.

"Those blind idiots! How dare they insult my sister?"
"I'll sue them into bankruptcy!"
"Just wait—I'm heading to Harvard's forum right now!"

All the brothers, Harvard alumni who never logged into campus forums, suddenly went online to defend Evelyn.

But the backlash had spiraled out of control. The smear campaign against Evelyn was clearly orchestrated—every rebuttal post was instantly drowned out.

Dominic Langley's expression darkened dangerously.

As a top-tier lawyer, he rarely showed emotion. Yet now, his knuckles turned white from how tightly he clenched his fists.

"Fifth brother?" Evelyn sensed the tension immediately.

Dominic forced a calm smile. "Just work stress."

He shot Victoria a discreet look.

Victoria caught on instantly. "Sweetheart, there's an urgent matter at the company. Why don't you chat with Ethan for a bit?"

Evelyn frowned, about to refuse, then remembered her agreement with Ethan Sullivan. Reluctantly, she nodded.

The three left the private dining room in haste.

The moment the door closed, Victoria's eyes welled up. "How dare they treat my daughter this way!"

She burned to reveal Evelyn's true identity publicly. But respecting her daughter's wish for privacy, she held back.

That didn't mean they'd stay passive.

Alone in the room, Evelyn and Ethan sat in suffocating silence.

Evelyn's spine stiffened, her entire body bristling like a porcupine.

"You're hiding something from me," she said abruptly, her gaze sharp as a blade.

Ethan feigned perfect confusion. "What?"

She stared him down but found no cracks in his facade.

"I need the restroom." She stood and left.

Outside, thunder roared.

Rain hammered against the windows in a violent downpour.

Evelyn stood at the sink, water rushing over her slender fingers.

Something was wrong.
Deeply wrong.

Her family's odd behavior, Ethan's微妙 expressions—it all stuck in her throat like a fishbone.

She dried her hands and gripped the door handle.

CRACK—

A flash of lightning split the sky.

The bathroom plunged into darkness.

Evelyn's breath froze in her chest.
###Chapter 56

Evelyn Laurent's fingers clenched the doorknob with desperate strength.

She yanked hard.

The door didn't budge.

Her breathing turned ragged as darkness swallowed her vision. Memories of suffocating blackness surged like a tidal wave, drowning her completely.

Her legs gave out. She slid down the wall, collapsing onto the cold tiles.

"Get away... all of you!"

She hugged her knees to her chest, nails digging crescent moons into her arms.

——

In the private dining room, Ethan Sullivan looked up at the sudden clap of thunder.

He checked his watch, brow furrowing.

Evelyn had been in the restroom for over twenty minutes.

His phone screen lit up briefly before dimming again. He rose and strode toward the hallway.

"Evelyn?"

Only his own echo answered in the empty corridor.

"Evelyn!"

His pace quickened, pulse accelerating inexplicably.

The restroom door resisted when he pushed it. His expression darkened.

Locked from inside.

"Evelyn! Open the door!"

His pounding knuckles met muffled sobs from within.

Ethan's pupils contracted. He stepped back and kicked the lock with brutal force.

Crash!

The door flew open.

Simultaneously, the hallway lights flickered out.

A lightning flash illuminated the scene—Evelyn curled into herself in the corner, dark hair spilling wildly over her shoulders.

"Don't come near me..."

Her voice was shredded beyond recognition, her entire body convulsing.

When Ethan reached for her, she shoved him away violently.

"Get out! Don't touch me!"

The force sent him stumbling back several steps.

"Evelyn! Look at me!"

He raised his voice above the thunder.

But she seemed deaf to everything, repeating fragmented phrases like a broken record.

"Why won't you believe me..."

"I didn't do anything wrong..."

Her whispers faded into nearly silent whimpers.

Ethan crouched down. Another lightning strike revealed her paper-white face.

"It's me. Ethan."

He extended his hand slowly, voice softening.

Evelyn jerked her head up, eyes unfocused.

"No... don't hit me..."

Her nails screeched against the tiles.

Ethan's chest constricted. Ignoring her thrashing, he pulled her into his arms.

"It's over. I'm here."

Her body stiffened momentarily before trembling violently again.

"Let go!"

She clawed at his arms, drawing blood.

Ethan tightened his embrace, murmuring reassurance against her ear.

"Look at me, Evelyn."

Lightning flashed once more.

Recognition finally flickered in her dilated pupils.

"E...Ethan?"

Her voice wavered uncertainly.

"Yes."

He wiped her tear-streaked face, alarmed by her icy skin.

"Can you stand?"

She nodded blankly, but her legs refused to cooperate.

Without hesitation, Ethan scooped her up bridal-style.

"Don't be afraid. I'm taking you out."

A waiter's startled voice echoed from the hallway.

"Sir! What happened?"

Ethan strode past without acknowledgment, heading straight for the elevator.

Evelyn lay motionless in his arms like a porcelain doll, only her fluttering lashes betraying her distress.

"Why..."

Her whisper barely reached him.

Ethan looked down into her glistening eyes.

"What?"

"Why did you come for me..."

Her voice thickened with unshed tears.

The elevator doors slid shut, sealing them away from the storm.

Ethan adjusted his hold, his deep voice resonating in the enclosed space.

"Because you were waiting for me."
###Chapter 57

"Lucian?"

Gasps erupted through the grand hall.

Every head swiveled toward the entrance. Lucian Blackwood stood framed in the doorway, an elegant woman at his side.

Her porcelain skin glowed, her features exquisitely sculpted. Every movement carried innate grace.

"Aurora Sinclair?"

Someone blurted the name aloud.

Violette's pupils contracted. Why was she with Lucian?

Before anyone could react, Victor Montgomery sneered, "You dare show your face?"

"Mr. Blackwood will arrive any moment," Zachary Winthrop added with mock concern. "Shouldn't you be running for your life instead of walking to your doom?"

Dylan Prescott and Nina Rutherford exchanged smirks.

"I came to celebrate Violette's birthday." Lucian's calm voice cut through the tension. Behind him, servers carried stacks of gilded gift boxes.

"Celebrate?" Zachary scoffed. "You think you're worthy?"

"Allow me to handle this." Charles Kensington stepped forward, his smile dripping with condescension.

Dylan muttered, "This venue belongs to Mr. Kensington. Is Lucian begging for humiliation?"

"Let's watch him get thrown out," Jasper Kensington snickered.

Charles looked down his nose at Lucian. "This is my private event. No invitation means no entry."

"Frankly, you don't belong here."

"Security!" he barked. "Remove these trespassers!"

The guards hesitated. "Sir, this is an exclusive gathering..."

"I'll pay double." Lucian's tone never wavered.

The security team froze.

"Double?" Charles laughed. "After swindling my son, now you challenge my wealth?"

As Southridge's richest man, he'd never lost a financial battle.

The crowd tittered. Beating Jasper in a spending contest meant nothing against a true tycoon.

"Name your terms." Lucian remained unruffled.

Violette stamped her foot. "Lucian, stop! You can't possibly—"

Charles lifted his chin. "You want a bidding war? Let's make it interesting."

He'd spend any amount to curry favor with the incoming Mr. Blackwood.

"Very well." Lucian gave Violette's hand a reassuring pat.

The guards scurried to fetch the owner.

All eyes gleamed with anticipation.

A portly man with long hair hurried in. His gaze lingered on Lucian, recognition flickering.

"Mr. Zhang." Zachary greeted him obsequiously.

This venue owner moved in powerful circles, far above Zachary's league.

"Shall we begin the auction?" Mr. Zhang asked with interest.

"No." Charles smirked. "Every bid gets paid immediately. No refunds—consider it birthday entertainment for Violette."

The room buzzed.

This wasn't mere posturing. The loser would forfeit actual millions.

"Still game?" Charles taunted.

Try me, boy. You're out of your depth.
###Chapter 58

The moment the corridor lights went out, Ethan Sullivan felt the same suffocating dread. But he couldn't afford to think about himself.

He had to admit—in that instant, only one thought consumed him: Evelyn Laurent must be kept safe.

Because in his dazed state, he'd almost convinced himself she was the person he'd been searching for.

Ethan's gaze darkened.

He held his phone in one hand, demanding updates from Harrison Whitmore. His other hand remained trapped in Evelyn's desperate grip.

Keeping her here had been a precaution—to shield her from certain truths. He feared her impulsive nature might drive her to pummel every last one of those men.

That was why Victoria Langley and the others had left.

But who could've predicted their planned solitude would dissolve into a storm, a blackout, and the onset of claustrophobia?

Ethan looked down at the woman curled against him.

All her usual sharp edges had melted away. Her pale face was a canvas of vulnerability. She huddled like a frightened fawn.

His phone vibrated abruptly.

Harrison's call.

The moment Ethan answered, white-hot pain lanced through his hand. Evelyn had unconsciously tightened her grip.

"Mn."

Harrison's voice cut off mid-sentence.

Had he misheard?

"Continue," Ethan commanded coldly.

Harrison hurried to report—only to hear another muffled groan.

This time, unmistakably female!

Harrison's eyes widened.

Then came the real shock: Evelyn's tearful accusation, "Ethan Sullivan, you're hurting me!"

Her voice bore no resemblance to its usual timbre—hoarse yet laced with an unfamiliar softness that left Harrison utterly speechless.
###Chapter 59

The phone slipped from Ethan Sullivan's palm, landing heavily on the bed.

He collided with Evelyn Laurent unexpectedly, his forehead pressing against her slender shoulder.

In a flash, he braced himself with his elbow against the mattress.

The distance between them vanished in an instant.

When Ethan lifted his head, the tip of his nose barely grazed Evelyn's jawline.

Their breaths mingled—warm and rapid.

Evelyn's eyes burned with fury, her gaze sharp as a blade.

As for Ethan—

His heartbeat stuttered out of rhythm.

His expression remained unreadable, every trace of emotion buried beneath icy detachment.

"How long do you plan to stay like this?"

Evelyn's voice was cold enough to freeze fire.

Ethan's arm muscles tensed as he pushed himself upright, abruptly ending Harrison Whitmore's call.

On the other end of the line, Harrison scratched his head in frustration.

What on earth were Mr. Sullivan and Evelyn doing?

What was that muffled thud?

Why did the atmosphere between them sound both charged and dangerously tense?

"An accident."

Ethan took half a step back, his tone betraying nothing.

His fingers absently twitched.

That moment—

Had been too close.

Close enough to count her lashes.

It was his first time being this physically near a woman.

The faint orchid scent clinging to Evelyn's shoulders left his pulse erratic.

Evelyn sat up, radiating an aura that warned against approach.

She struggled to piece together fragmented memories.

Only after her outburst did she realize she'd been gripping Ethan's wrist in a death hold.

His fall hadn't been accidental—she'd yanked him down.

Her last clear memory ended with the bathroom lights cutting out.

Upon waking, she'd thought herself trapped in darkness, but—

The room's atmosphere turned glacial.

"My fault."

Evelyn lowered her head, her voice still rough from sleep.

Stripped of its usual edge, her tone held an unexpected softness—like feathers brushing Ethan's ear.

A flicker of surprise crossed Ethan's eyes.

Who knew this thorny rose could show vulnerability?

Without her defenses, Evelyn seemed almost... docile.

"No harm done."

The moment he spoke, his phone rang again.

Harrison's cautious voice came through: "Um... should I call back later?"
###Chapter 60

Ethan's face darkened instantly.

"Your monthly bonus is revoked."

Harrison's eyes widened in shock. "Mr. Sullivan! I apologize!"

He had only asked a polite question—why was he being penalized?

Ethan cut him off impatiently. "Get to the point."

Harrison straightened immediately. "The forum incident has been investigated, but the storm prevents us from apprehending the suspects at Harvard right now."

He hesitated before adding, "There's another matter... Professor Klein discovered what happened to Miss Laurent and spoke up on the forum. The students mocked him."

A dangerous glint flashed in Ethan's eyes.

Meanwhile, in Professor Klein's dorm...

"Outrageous!" The elderly professor slammed his fist on the table.

He had just created a forum account when he saw his prized student being viciously slandered.

Three other distinguished professors—including Dr. Ashford—rushed over to support him.

The four gray-haired academic titans now fumbled awkwardly with their phone screens.

"These insolent brats!" Dr. Ashford's hands trembled with anger.

For every reply they typed, dozens of mocking responses flooded in.

Thunder rumbled outside as the four professors sat grim-faced.

Finally, Professor Klein snapped. He called President Evans.

The startled university president answered groggily. "Professor? What's wrong?"

"Gregory Evans! How dare you allow this!" Professor Klein roared. "My protégé is being cyberbullied, and now your students are insulting us to our faces!"

President Evans jolted awake. "What?"

"Fix this! Now!" Professor Klein stomped his foot. "If my student leaves because of this, I'll hold you personally responsible!"

President Evans nearly dropped his phone.

The Physics Department's four most revered scholars—plus their genius protégé—were being attacked on the university's own forum?

This was unacceptable.
###Chapter 61

The downpour outside rattled the windows when Gregory Evans jolted awake to Benjamin Klein's call.

"The forum's exploding!" Benjamin's voice cut through the storm.

Gregory tumbled out of bed. The computer's blue glow cast shadows across his ashen face. His vision swam at the sight of Harvard University's forum homepage flooded with red-hot posts.

"Handle this now!"

His fingers trembled as he dialed the forum administrator. Simultaneously, he fired off an urgent message to Ethan Sullivan.

Ethan's reply came startlingly fast. A detailed list materialized—each username matched to a real identity.

Gregory stared at the names with a bitter laugh. This would be an all-nighter.

——

In the Grand Hyatt's hallway, Ethan had just hung up after calming Benjamin.

He turned—and froze.

Evelyn Laurent stood in the doorway. Her gaze was colder than the rain lashing the windows.

"What happened?" Her voice held a razor's edge.

A flicker of panic crossed Ethan's eyes before his composure returned. "Nothing major."

Evelyn's stare could flay skin. She'd overheard the call. Sensed the tension.

"Ethan Sullivan. Don't lie to me."

That look made his chest constrict. For a heartbeat, he saw the fierce little girl from his memories.

"Rumors on the forum." He softened his tone. "Already contained."

Evelyn arched a brow. "That's it?"

Her nonchalance left him speechless. Six brothers were tearing the forum apart, yet she remained unshaken.

"The rumor-mongers..." Her eyes narrowed to slits. "Just beat them up."

Ethan shook his head. "Not an option."
###Chapter 62

Master Alistair stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his gaze fixed on Felix Arnault. "Felix, are you satisfied?"

A faint smile touched Felix's lips, but his eyes remained icy. "His groveling was the price for earlier offenses."

His finger pointed at Magnus Blackthorn. "Now... he dared raise a hand against me. The price has changed."

Master Alistair's brow furrowed slightly. "What do you want?"

"Magnus is powerful and harbors deep hatred for me." Felix's voice was calm. "Letting him keep his cultivation would cost me sleep."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Magnus's eyes burned crimson, his entire body trembling. "Felix! You go too far!"

"Know your limits, Felix," Master Alistair warned.

"I find this perfectly fair." Felix didn't yield an inch.

He knew Magnus's nature too well. Sparing the tiger today meant certain death tomorrow.

Master Alistair fell silent.

To stand at the pinnacle of the heavens, he was no saint. Justice and righteousness meant nothing to him. Only profit mattered.

Had Felix been an ordinary First Star cultivator, he'd have crushed him already. But now...

Magnus's internal alarms blared at his master's silence.

"Master!" His voice cracked as he struggled to rise. "You'd actually listen to him?"

With a flick of his sleeve, Master Alistair froze Magnus in place like a marionette.

Felix's pulse quickened. This old monster's power was unfathomable—killing him would be child's play. His leverage existed only because he still held value.

Power. That was the only truth.

"Magnus." Master Alistair finally spoke. "Shatter your own cultivation, and I'll spare your life."

Magnus looked as if struck by lightning, his face deathly pale.

"Master!" His voice shook. "You'd discard decades of my training... for him?"

"Had you not repeatedly targeted Felix," Master Alistair said coldly, "we wouldn't be here."

"I—" Magnus suddenly laughed, a broken sound. "Fine. Just fine!"

Before the echoes faded, he lunged toward the Trial Tower's exit.

Master Alistair sighed and raised his hand.

Magnus froze mid-air as if trapped in quicksand.

"Since you refuse, I'll do it for you."

Invisible forces dragged Magnus back, his eyes filled with despair. "Master! Felix! Spare me!"

Felix's expression didn't change.

Master Alistair's palm descended lightly.

"Ahhh—!" Magnus's scream tore through the air.

The crisp sound of shattering came from within his body. Countless starlight erupted from his orifices like a celestial river pouring forth.

A full minute passed before the light dissipated.

Magnus collapsed, his cultivation utterly destroyed.
###Chapter 63

Ethan Sullivan's gaze pierced through Evelyn Laurent like a blade.

"You're wrong."

Evelyn stiffened instantly, her eyes flashing with frost. "About what?"

Her voice dripped with ice.

Ethan adjusted his cuffs with deliberate calm. "You think fighting solves everything?"

"None of your damn business," Evelyn scoffed, her lips curling. "I do what I want."

She bristled like a feral cat, claws ready to unsheathe.

Ethan realized then—this girl was pure defiance. To her, fists spoke louder than words.

"Violence only makes things worse."

"Spare me the lecture, Saint Sullivan," she mocked, nails digging into her palms. "Next you'll call me uncivilized?"

She took a step closer. "Or maybe..." Her voice turned venomous. "You'll call the cops on your favorite 'murderer' again?"

His throat tightened. That mistaken accusation still weighed on him.

Silence stretched between them. A flicker of pain crossed Evelyn's eyes.

"What would you know?" Her voice trembled.

"I know defending yourself isn't wrong," Ethan said suddenly.

Evelyn's head snapped up.

"But what about the people who care about you?" His voice softened. "Your parents. Your brothers. Professor Klein..."

Her pupils contracted.

She saw it then—the disappointment in her family's eyes, just like Vincent Lowell's gaze years ago.

The image stole her breath.
###Chapter 64

Raindrops tapped against the windowpane.

Evelyn Laurent stood by her dorm window, fingers absently tracing the phone screen.

Ethan Sullivan leaned against the doorframe, his gaze fixed on her tense silhouette.

"The forum incident... your family knows."

His quiet words made her whirl around.

"They—"

"Your parents and brothers acted immediately." Ethan took a step closer. "They gathered all the evidence and cleared your name online."

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

"Professor Klein and several faculty members posted too." Ethan paused. "President Evans personally contacted the forum moderators."

The rain outside suddenly grew louder.

Evelyn looked down at her whitened knuckles.

"So now," Ethan's voice held a note of admonishment, "do you still want to storm out for revenge?"

Her phone screen lit up.

Evelyn opened the forum. Professor Klein's statement topped the pinned posts.

Dozens of replies followed—testimonies from lab mates, support from seniors in her department, and...

She spotted Alexander's username.

Her usually stoic eldest brother was methodically debunking every rumor, each word radiating protectiveness.

"I didn't know..." Her voice cracked.

Ethan studied her reddened eyes, something flickering in his expression.

"Don't let them down."

The words surprised even himself.

They should have been strangers.

Yet he remembered that little girl standing alone in the hospital corridor years ago, drenched in rain.

The forum page kept refreshing.

More voices rose in her defense.

"Special admissions screening is stricter than regular exams!"

"I've seen Evelyn's lab reports—she's more than qualified."

"Will the rumor-mongers dare to use real names?"

Each comment settled like a weight in her chest.

Not painful.

But an unfamiliar sensation—being protected.

She suddenly realized she wasn't alone anymore.

Ethan noticed her shoulders gradually relaxing, the faintest smile touching his lips.

When he turned away, his usual aloof mask slid back into place.

The rain continued.

But somewhere deep inside, Evelyn felt a sliver of light breaking through.
###Chapter 65

Sophia Lowell curled up under her blankets, the cold glow of her phone screen casting eerie shadows across her contorted face.

Her nails dug deep into her palms as she stared at the flood of comments defending Evelyn Laurent.

What were these sudden posts?

Those people claiming to be Evelyn's professors even had Harvard faculty verification badges?

Impossible!

She'd investigated thoroughly—Evelyn was just an uneducated country bumpkin!

Sophia's breathing turned ragged, her chest heaving violently.

With trembling fingers, she sent a voice message to her clique: "Seniors...please don't worry about me...Evelyn is...truly exceptional..."

Her voice carried the perfect tremble of suppressed tears.

Her phone immediately buzzed with frantic responses.

"Sophia, don't be fooled! Those are obviously paid trolls Evelyn hired!"

"Just wait—we'll teach her a lesson!"

"That bitch deserves to be ruined!"

Three male students typed furiously in their respective dorm rooms, eyes bloodshot with rage.

"Professor Klein? Don't make me laugh! Evelyn's not worthy!"

"Special Harvard admission? More like sleeping her way in!"

"How much is Evelyn paying you? I'll double it!"

Their insults grew increasingly vicious, fingers flying across keyboards.

Suddenly, all three screens went black simultaneously.

"What the—"

"My account got suspended?"

They exchanged bewildered glances just as their dorm doors burst open.

Campus security officers stormed in, faces grim.

"So you're the ones spreading slander online?" The lead officer barked. "And insulting Professor Klein?"

"We didn't—" they chorused in panicked denial.

The officer冷笑ed, thrusting forward a phone screen.

"Professor Klein personally filed the complaint. The evidence is irrefutable."

All color drained from their faces.

One boy's legs gave out, collapsing to the floor in a heap.
###Chapter 66

Harvard professors were notoriously low-profile.

They rarely appeared on campus forums.

Publicly berating students was unthinkable.

"Enough talk! Come with us!"

The head security officer barked. Several burly guards immediately restrained the three students.

"On what grounds are you arresting us?"

"We're exchange students! We have IDs!"

"Let me go!"

They struggled violently against the iron grips. Fear crept into their hearts as confusion set in.

The commotion woke the entire dorm floor.

Students rubbed sleep from their eyes and peeked out.

A thunderstorm raged outside.

Security personnel swarmed the halls.

This level of mobilization was unprecedented.

When the trio reached the dorm supervisor's office, Dr. Gregory Evans was waiting.

Rain lashed against the windows.

Water still dripped from Evans' hair.

He'd rushed to campus after receiving Ethan Sullivan's list.

This couldn't wait until morning.

Evelyn Laurent was Harvard's prized protege.

She wouldn't suffer injustice.

Especially not after enduring vicious rumors for a week.

Delaying action risked irreparable damage.

Along with the three instigators, over a dozen copycat harassers were brought in.

All fell silent upon seeing Evans' stormy expression.

"You three started this?"

His gaze cut like a blade.

The exchange students came from the same university.

Respectable, but no Harvard.

Now they trembled before the dean.

"We...we just shared opinions..."

Evans slammed the desk.

Printed forum posts scattered across it.

Every malicious comment clearly visible.

"Opinions?" He sneered. "This is blatant defamation!"

The office held its breath.

"The university has contacted law enforcement."

"Your exchange privileges are revoked."

"You'll be escorted home at dawn."

Evans turned to the others, voice glacial. "The rest receive disciplinary marks. Tomorrow's bulletin will announce it."

Rain hammered the windows like a judge's gavel.
###Chapter 67

Silence fell over the dormitory the moment Dr. Gregory Evans finished speaking.

"President, we were just expressing our opinions. Why should we be punished?"

A male student's face flushed red, his fists clenched tight.

The three exchange students jumped to their feet. "Revoked? We're the top students from our universities!"

Dr. Evans' gaze was icy. "Harvard doesn't tolerate students with corrupt morals."

"Evelyn Laurent didn't even take the college entrance exam. How did she get in?" One exchange student sneered. "Did she use some shady connections?"

Thud!

Dr. Evans slammed a test paper onto the table.

"This is how."

All eyes locked onto the perfect score.

Harvard students gasped. They knew the difficulty of the special admission exam—achieving full marks was nearly impossible.

"Defaming a classmate. Insulting a professor." Dr. Evans enunciated each word. "Explain yourselves to the police tomorrow."

"Police?"

The three exchange students paled instantly.

"We just posted online. We didn't hurt her!"

"A police record will ruin our futures!"

Panic set in, their voices trembling.

Bang!

The dorm door flew open.

Dominic Langley strode in with a legal team, rainwater still glistening on his suit.

"I'm Evelyn Laurent's attorney." His cold gaze swept the room. "You're being sued for defamation. Expect legal notices."

The trio's legs gave out, collapsing to the floor.

Other students bowed their heads in apology, not daring to breathe too loudly.

Meanwhile, Harvard's official website released an urgent announcement:

Findings on the Rumor Investigation

"After verification, forum posts claiming Evelyn Laurent 'gained admission through backdoor deals' and 'lacks academic qualifications' are confirmed as malicious rumors."

"Although Ms. Laurent didn't take the college entrance exam, she scored perfectly on Harvard's special admission test."

"The perpetrators—exchange students Liu Yu, Wang Fei, and Duan Gang—have committed defamation. The university has decided:"

"1. Immediate revocation of their exchange student status and repatriation."
"2. Handover to judicial authorities."
"3. Public censure for all other participants in the rumor campaign."

A lengthy list of names accompanied the notice.

That night, Harvard's forums erupted in chaos.
###Chapter 68

The blue glow of the phone screen illuminated Sophia's twisted expression.

Her fingers clenched the bedsheet so tightly her nails nearly tore through the fabric.

"Evelyn Laurent..." She gritted her teeth as she spat out the name.

The hushed whispers of her roommates pierced her ears like needles.

"Did you hear Evelyn got special admission to Harvard?"

"Perfect scores? That's insane!"

"Didn't Sophia say she was some country bumpkin?"

Sophia abruptly turned over and buried her face in her pillow.

Her chest felt like it was weighed down by a boulder, making it hard to breathe.

The forum announcement had been a slap to the face.

All her carefully crafted rumors had been shattered in an instant.

"No..." She bit her lip, a ruthless glint flashing in her eyes.

She had to find a way to turn this around.

At the very least, she needed to cover her own tracks.

By the floor-to-ceiling windows of The Grand Hyatt, Evelyn set her phone down.

Moonlight spilled over her cold, delicate profile.

"Had enough of staring?" she suddenly asked.

Ethan lounged on the sofa, his gaze dark and unreadable.

"You have claustrophobia." It wasn't a question.

Evelyn's fingertips trembled faintly.

She turned to face him, her eyes sharp as blades.

"Investigating me?"

Ethan rose and stepped closer.

"Why were you sent to a psychiatric hospital?"

The air froze instantly.

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

"Get out." Her voice was ice.
###Chapter 69

Ethan Sullivan's gaze lingered on Evelyn Laurent's face before finally looking away.

"Get some rest."

He turned and left, his tall frame elongated by the corridor lights.

Evelyn stared at the closed door, brows slightly furrowed.

She hopped off the bed and locked the door with a sharp click.

The warm glow of the bedside lamp cast shadows across half her face.

Her phone screen lit up as messages from Victoria Langley flooded in one after another.

"Don't forget breakfast, sweetheart."
"Don't overwork yourself in the lab."
"Come home this weekend. I'll make you soup."

Her fingers skimmed the screen, then paused. The deleted forum posts flashed through her mind.

Her family had always protected her in silence.

Just as Ethan said—she could disregard the world, but not this warmth.

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Evelyn opened her door and met Ethan's deep, unreadable eyes.

"Morning."

He handed her a glass of warm milk, his sleeves carrying the faint scent of the kitchen.

She turned away and headed straight for the elevator.

The aroma of fried eggs filled the dining room.

She took a few hurried bites before standing to leave.

"Wait."

Ethan caught her wrist, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Last night... I crossed a line."

Evelyn let out a cold laugh, nails digging into her palms.

Memories of forced sedatives surged back.

"Save the apology."

Ethan grabbed his car keys and followed.

"I need to see Professor Klein anyway."

As the black sedan entered campus, Evelyn gazed blankly out the window.

The lab stood empty.

An assistant explained the professors were sleeping in after an all-night battle with online trolls.

Evelyn pulled on her white coat and walked into the sterile room without looking back.
###Chapter 70

Ethan Sullivan watched Evelyn Laurent's focused silhouette and sighed softly.

Her slender fingers danced across the keyboard, streams of data reflecting in her clear eyes.

He turned toward the lounge area, waiting for Professor Benjamin Klein's arrival.

Meanwhile...

Professor Zhou Wen from the Physics Department led eight elite students across campus.

Sunlight filtered through the plane tree leaves, casting dappled shadows on their figures.

"Today we're visiting the national laboratory headed by Professor Benjamin Klein," Zhou adjusted his glasses.

"It houses the country's top physicists and most advanced equipment."

The students held their breaths, eyes gleaming with anticipation.

Isabella Valentine clutched her notebook tightly.

She had deliberately worn her most formal white blouse, every strand of hair perfectly in place.

This was the opportunity she'd dreamed of.

Sophia Lowell trailed at the end of the group.

She adjusted her collar nervously, trying to hide her unease.

Since the three troublemakers got expelled, she'd noticed the strange looks people gave her.

The laboratory doors slid open.

A wave of chilled air carried metallic and chemical scents.

Through glass walls, researchers in white coats bustled around precision instruments.

"Watch your step," Zhou whispered. "Don't touch anything."

Evelyn adjusted a laser interferometer with meticulous precision.

Her forehead glistened with sweat, stray hairs clinging to her skin.

A sudden knock interrupted her work.

Unfamiliar faces stood outside. Zhou smiled amiably. "Excuse me, may we tour the facility?"

Evelyn's gaze swept across the group, pausing briefly on Sophia.

"Did Professor Klein authorize this?" Her voice was flat.

Zhou's smile froze.

Isabella's eyes widened in recognition. This was the legendary prodigy everyone talked about.

Sophia instinctively stepped back, nails digging into her palms.

She never expected to encounter Evelyn here.

The laboratory air seemed to solidify.
###Chapter 71

Zhou Wen maintained a professional smile as he pulled out his phone, the screen still glowing. "Professor Klein has approved it." He handed the device to Evelyn Laurent.

Evelyn took the phone, her fingers gliding over the screen. Professor Benjamin Klein's reply was clearly visible. She gave a slight nod and stepped aside. "Proceed." Her voice was soft but carried an unmistakable warning. "But maintain distance. Do not touch any equipment."

The instruments on the lab bench emitted a faint glow, their data cables arranged with spiderweb precision. This optical system had taken her three sleepless nights to assemble. The slightest vibration could render a week's worth of data useless.

Zhou Wen immediately straightened. "Understood." He turned to the students behind him. "Everyone, observe only. No touching."

The students nodded in unison. Sophia Lowell lingered at the back of the group, her brow furrowed. That voice earlier... She shook her head. It must have been her imagination. There was no way Evelyn could be here.

As the group moved forward, the full layout of the lab came into view. Sophia's pupils constricted sharply. The slender figure standing by the lab bench, holding a clipboard—wasn't that Evelyn?

Her nails dug into her palms. Impossible! How could Evelyn be in a national-level research lab?

Zhou Wen had already begun explaining the equipment's principles, but Sophia didn't hear a word. Her gaze was magnetically locked onto Evelyn. Only when she noticed the broom in Evelyn's hand did her tension ease slightly.

"Just a janitor," Sophia sneered inwardly, finally taking in the lab's grandeur.

The silver precision instruments gleamed coldly under the lights, their intricate piping arranged like works of art. Zhou Wen warned the students again. "Optical alignment requires extreme precision. Any contact will ruin the experiment."

Everyone took a step back—except Sophia, whose attention snagged on the metal plaque on the wall. When she read the engraved words, her breath stopped.

Lab Director: Evelyn Laurent.

"You've got to be kidding!" Sophia nearly blurted aloud. Her eyes burned into those three words as if trying to incinerate them. This had to be a mistake. It had to be!

The lab lights suddenly felt blinding. A wave of dizziness hit her. She forced herself to look away, only to find her hands trembling uncontrollably.
###Chapter 72

Evelyn Laurent's gaze pierced Sophia Lowell like shards of ice.

She detected the subtle shift in Sophia's expression with predatory precision.

Evelyn closed the distance between them without breaking stride.

She maintained exactly three paces between them, her eyes tracking Sophia's every move.

Cold sweat trickled down Sophia's spine.

"Evelyn..." Sophia finally turned, her voice trembling. "Why are you looking at me like that?"

A glacial smile curved Evelyn's lips.

"Thief prevention." The two words cut through the air like a scalpel.

The laboratory atmosphere turned arctic.

Zhou Wen and other students cast confused glances their way.

Sophia's eyes reddened. "I...I just came to observe..."

"Really?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Last time you 'observed,' my experimental data got corrupted."

Sophia's face drained of color.

Professor Zhou strode over, positioning himself between them.

"Miss Lowell," he said sternly. "Mind your conduct."

Sophia's eyes widened in disbelief.

She hadn't expected even her advisor to side with Evelyn.

"Professor..." Her fingers twisted the hem of her blouse as she lowered her head.

Zhou's gaze sharpened. "Leave now if you're not here to learn."

Sophia's entire body stiffened.

Suppressing her fury, she forced an obedient smile. "I'll pay close attention."

As she turned away, her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

Evelyn observed the performance with detached amusement.

She knew her cousin's tricks all too well.

The tour resumed.

Sophia pretended rapt attention while her eyes darted around the lab.

Her focus locked onto a senior researcher ahead.

The opportunity presented itself.

Sophia drifted closer with calculated nonchalance.

As the researcher turned—

"Ah!"

A shriek echoed through the laboratory.

The senior stumbled backward into a workstation.

Evelyn's pupils contracted to pinpoints.
###Chapter 73

Bianca Fairchild was completely absorbed in analyzing experimental data, her fingers flying across the keyboard.

Suddenly, she felt a chill run down her spine as someone pressed against her from behind.

"Ah!" she gasped, lurching forward—nearly colliding with the delicate lab equipment.

At the last second, a pair of slender but strong hands caught her from the side, steadying her.

"Careful," Isabella Valentine murmured in her ear.

Bianca trembled in Isabella's arms, her chest heaving. Only then did she notice Sophia Lowell standing behind her, blinking innocently.

"Sorry, senior. I just wanted to see the data..." Sophia said meekly.

Evelyn Laurent strode over, her gaze sharp as a blade. She seized Sophia's wrist with enough force to make her yelp.

"Was that on purpose?" Evelyn's voice was ice-cold.

Tears welled in Sophia's eyes. "Evelyn, you're hurting me! It was an accident..."

Professor Klein rushed over to inspect the equipment, sighing in relief when he confirmed everything was intact. He glared at them sternly. "This is a laboratory, not a playground! Bianca, you're usually the most careful. What happened?"

Bianca bit her lip, pale-faced. "Professor, I didn’t realize someone was behind me..."

Her hands trembled slightly. The precision instruments were worth a fortune. If she had damaged them...

"Stop pretending," Isabella sneered suddenly. "I saw you deliberately bump into Bianca."

Sophia's face twisted, tears streaming harder. "Isabella, how could you accuse me like this?"

She turned pleading eyes to Evelyn. "Evelyn, I was just curious..."

Evelyn released her wrist without expression and pointed to the door. "Get out."

"Evelyn—"

"Now." Her tone brooked no argument.

Sophia covered her face and fled the lab, shoulders shaking. But no one saw the venomous glint in her eyes as she turned away.

Professor Klein rubbed his hands awkwardly. "Evelyn, this is my fault..."

"Not yours," Evelyn said, her voice softening slightly. "But with all due respect, your student needs to review lab safety protocols."

She turned to methodically check each piece of equipment, her movements precise and efficient. Isabella handed her tools seamlessly, their coordination flawless.

With a sigh, Professor Klein ushered the other students out.

The lab fell silent except for the faint hum of machinery—and Evelyn's tense profile.
###Chapter 74

Zhou Wen clenched his fists so tightly his nails dug into his palms.

He wanted nothing more than to slap Sophia Lowell and Bianca Fairchild right then and there.

For this lab tour opportunity, he had camped outside Professor Klein's office for three straight days. All those humiliating pleas, those all-nighters writing guarantees—wasted.

"Stand still!" Zhou Wen whirled around, his voice a dangerous whisper. "Who gave you permission to fool around in the lab?"

On the hallway bench, Sophia's sniffles cut off abruptly. She wiped her tears hastily, shrinking behind her classmates when she spotted Isabella Valentine.

"Stop playing victim," Isabella yanked aside the shielding student. "Weren't you the one throwing yourself at Bianca in the lab?"

Sophia's face paled, lips trembling. "I—I just wanted to steady Bianca—"

"Shut it!" Isabella sneered. "We all see through your act."

Bianca suddenly stepped forward, her voice barely audible. "M-Mia, it was my fault—"

"Here we go again!" Isabella shoved Bianca hard. "Every single time! Sophia pushes you, you claim you slipped. She steals your thesis, you say your work was subpar. Bianca, where's your spine?"

Bianca staggered back, slamming against the wall. She opened her mouth but ultimately hung her head, letting loose strands hide her reddened eyes.

Isabella stormed off, her lab coat flaring sharply behind her.

"Mia!" Bianca reached out but grasped only air.

Zhou Wen's temple throbbed. His glare swept over the students before landing on Sophia. "Out. Now. All of you."

Sophia hurried away with her classmates' support, shooting Bianca one last venomous glance around the corner.

Bianca trailed behind, each step deliberate as if walking on knives.

Inside the lab, Evelyn Laurent observed coldly through the viewing window. As Bianca passed, her fingers tapped twice against the glass.

"What happened?" Professor Klein's voice carried from the stairwell.

Zhou Wen stiffened, rushing to intercept. "Professor, we... concluded early."

Professor Klein frowned at the dejected group, his gaze lingering on Bianca's swollen eyes. Ethan Sullivan stepped forward slightly, his eyes narrowing behind his glasses.

"Professor Zhou," Ethan's tone was mild. "The lab equipment... nothing's missing, I hope?"
###Chapter 75

Zhou Wen stood at the laboratory entrance, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. His fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white. After much hesitation, he bowed deeply to Prof. Benjamin Klein.

"Professor Klein, my sincerest apologies." His voice strained. "My students nearly knocked over the lab equipment."

Prof. Klein's brow furrowed slightly. His sharp gaze swept over the cowering students behind Zhou Wen. Every instrument in this lab represented years of his painstaking work.

"Fortunately no damage was done." Zhou Wen kept his forehead pressed against his clasped hands, not daring to look up. "I'll accept any disciplinary action."

An oppressive silence filled the laboratory. The students held their breath, shoulders hunched.

"Don't let it happen again." Prof. Klein's voice cut like ice. "Control your people."

Zhou Wen nodded vigorously, visibly relieved. As he turned to leave, Isabella Valentine cast one last longing glance toward the lab's interior—but received no acknowledgment from the professor.

Inside the lab, Evelyn Laurent was intently calibrating equipment. Without looking up, she remarked, "Professor, they almost toppled the centrifuge."

Prof. Klein's expression darkened instantly. "Were you hurt?"

"I'm fine." Evelyn finally glanced up, then froze when she spotted Ethan Sullivan. "Why are you still here?"

Ethan spread his hands helplessly. "I came to discuss the collaboration project."

Prof. Klein's eyes darted between them, amusement flickering in his gaze. "Did young Sullivan offend you?"

"No." Evelyn turned away abruptly, handling the equipment with unnecessary force.

The professor tactfully changed the subject. Clearing his throat, he said, "Evelyn, you'll resume classes in the Physics Department starting today."

Her hands stilled mid-motion. "Now?"

"Your schedule's been sent to your phone." He patted her shoulder. "We don't want other professors thinking I'm hoarding students."

Evelyn packed up her equipment and strode out without a backward glance. Passing Ethan, she deliberately stomped her feet.

In the Physics Department classroom, Sophia Lowell was slumped over her desk, sobbing. A group of girls clustered around her.

"Sophia, did the lab tour go badly?"

"Did Professor Klein yell at you?"

Sophia lifted her tear-streaked face just as Evelyn pushed through the door. Her fingers tightened around the tissue in her hand.
###Chapter 76

Sophia Lowell slumped over her desk, shoulders trembling slightly.

"I was just standing near the senior during the experiment..." she sniffled. "She didn't notice me and accidentally bumped into me..."

Outraged murmurs erupted around her.

"How is this Sophia's fault? That senior wasn't paying attention!"

"Exactly. Sophia would never block someone on purpose."

Several boys nodded in agreement.

The corners of Sophia's lips twitched upward before she quickly suppressed it. She buried her face deeper, voice laced with feigned remorse. "The senior was probably focused... I shouldn't have stood so close..."

"Are you sure it wasn't intentional?"

A cool voice cut through the chatter from the doorway.

Sophia's head snapped up. Evelyn Laurent leaned against the doorframe, her black athletic jacket making her porcelain skin glow.

"Evelyn..." Sophia's expression faltered. "Of course I didn't—"

Evelyn smirked coldly and strode to the front row.

The classroom fell silent.

All eyes followed her slender figure.

After a hesitant pause, a few girls gathered the courage to approach Evelyn.

"Sorry..." A ponytailed girl murmured. "We shouldn't have believed those rumors online."

"You're actually amazing..."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

She hadn't expected apologies.

"It's fine." Her voice softened. "We didn't know each other before."

"Your smile is gorgeous!" the ponytailed girl exclaimed.

Another girl with short hair stepped forward. "I'm Lillian Rothschild! Can we be friends?"

Evelyn stiffened at the sudden warmth but nodded.

"Perfect!" Lillian beamed, grabbing her hand. "Can I ask you for help with assignments?"

"Sure."

Encouraged, other classmates swarmed around her.

"Me too!"

"I want to be friends!"

Surrounded by genuine smiles, something inside Evelyn quietly melted.

So this... was how friendship felt.

At the other end of the room, Sophia clenched her pen so tightly her nails nearly pierced her palms.

Watching Evelyn bask in the spotlight, a shadow flickered in her eyes.
###Chapter 77

The classroom atmosphere froze abruptly.

Sophia Lowell's fingers turned white as she clutched her skirt, her nails nearly digging into her palms.

She glared at Evelyn Laurent surrounded by admirers, her chest heaving violently.

"Sophia, maybe..." her best friend began hesitantly.

Sophia violently shook off her hand, a dark glint flashing in her eyes.

"Evelyn." She suddenly smiled sweetly, her voice crisp as morning dew. "I was wrong to judge you by appearances earlier."

She sauntered toward Evelyn, her skirt swaying gracefully.

"But..." Sophia lowered her voice to a whisper only Evelyn could hear. "Do you really think this means you've won?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, watching her with amusement.

A sharp slap echoed through the room.

Sophia collapsed onto the floor dramatically, clutching her cheek with teary eyes. "Evelyn, I already apologized. Why did you hit me?"

Gasps filled the classroom.

"Hit you?" Evelyn scoffed. "With acting skills that bad, you should audition for drama school."

"Enough!" The class president slammed his desk. "Evelyn, don't push your luck!"

Several boys immediately formed a protective circle around Sophia.

Evelyn glanced around, then smiled.

She leisurely pulled a voice recorder from her bag and pressed play.

"...Do you really think this means you've won?" Sophia's venomous whisper filled the silent room.

The air turned to ice.

Sophia paled, her lips trembling wordlessly.

"Keep performing." Evelyn toyed with the recorder. "I've got plenty more where that came from."

A quiet chuckle came from the doorway.

Everyone turned to see Ethan Sullivan leaning against the frame, twirling car keys.

"Perfect timing." His gaze swept the room lazily. "What a scene."

Sophia's tears vanished instantly as she frantically smoothed her skirt.

"Ethan..." she called timidly.

He walked straight past her, draping his jacket over Evelyn's shoulders. "Let's go. Professor Klein wants you."

Pausing beside Sophia, he added without looking back: "Oh, Professor Zhou asked me to tell you - the research team roster needs reevaluation."

Sophia staggered back as if struck.

Evelyn turned, giving her a knowing smile.

As the door closed, Sophia's hysterical scream pierced through.
###Chapter 78

Evelyn Laurent's gaze was icy.

She stared at Sophia Lowell's hypocritical face, feeling nothing but disgust.

This so-called cousin had been making snide remarks about her since the moment she walked in.

"Country bumpkin." "Bottom-ranked loser." "Ill-mannered brat."

Every word from Sophia's mouth carried venom, yet she pretended to be innocent.

The other students in the classroom began whispering, casting sidelong glances at Evelyn.

Then Evelyn smiled.

She rose slowly and walked toward Sophia.

"Since you love spreading rumors so much," she said softly, "how about a bet?"

Sophia instinctively took half a step back. "W-what kind of bet?"

"On the midterm results." Evelyn pulled out a stack of test papers from her bag. "If I score lower than you, I'll kneel and apologize in front of everyone."

She paused, her eyes sharpening.

"But if I score higher..."

Sophia's face paled.

She knew Evelyn's grades had improved drastically recently.

"I-I won't bet with you!" Sophia waved her hands frantically. "You're just some—"

"Then shut up." Evelyn cut her off coldly. "If I hear one more word from you..."

Her hand suddenly lifted.

Sophia shrieked and dropped to her knees.

The classroom fell silent.

Everyone stared in shock.

Evelyn looked down at her. "Apologize."

Sophia trembled, tears rolling down her cheeks. "I-I'm sorry..."

Just then, the classroom door opened.

Ethan Sullivan walked in with a stack of textbooks, his gaze landing on Sophia kneeling on the floor.

He raised an eyebrow, his eyes lingering on Evelyn for a second.

Sophia's face turned deathly pale.

The person whose opinion she cared about most had just witnessed her humiliation.

"Evelyn..." She clutched at Evelyn's sleeve. "Please forgive me..."

Evelyn shook her off without a word and returned to her seat.

Ethan cleared his throat and stepped onto the podium.

The classroom erupted in squeals.

"It's Ethan!"

"Oh my god, he's so handsome!"

The girls blushed with excitement.

Only Sophia remained on the floor, biting her lip hard.

She glared at Evelyn's back, her eyes filled with venom.

That bitch did this on purpose!

She waited until Ethan arrived to humiliate her!

Evelyn seemed to sense it. She glanced back and gave Sophia a knowing smile.

Sophia shuddered, nearly collapsing again.
###Chapter 79

Ethan Sullivan stood at the podium, a faint smile playing on his lips. His slender fingers tapped lightly against the edge as his gaze swept across the lecture hall.

The room fell silent instantly.

Evelyn Laurent sat in the front row, twirling a pen between her fingers. She noticed his eyes lingered on her longer than anyone else.

"The girl in the white blouse, third row."

His voice rang clear as jade.

Evelyn looked up, meeting his amused eyes.

"Would you answer the question I just posed?"

Every head turned toward her.

She set down her pen and stood. Her cool, precise response cut through the air.

A flicker of surprise crossed Ethan's eyes before he countered with a more complex question.

Evelyn answered without hesitation.

After several rounds, whispers rippled through the classroom.

"She actually knows the answer to such difficult questions..."
"No wonder she's a scholarship student..."

Sophia Lowell's grip on her pen turned her knuckles white. She glared at Evelyn's back, disbelief burning in her eyes.

Ethan suddenly smiled. "Your name?"

"Evelyn Laurent."

"Excellent." He nodded. "Starting today, you'll be my teaching assistant."

The room erupted.

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "I decline."

Silence crashed over the murmurs.

Ethan regarded her with interest. "Reason?"

"Waste of time." Her reply was razor-sharp.

Sophia rose gracefully. "Professor Sullivan, Evelyn is rather introverted. Perhaps she's not suited—"

Ethan raised a hand, cutting her off.

"Miss Laurent," he drawled, "this position grants early access to research materials."

Evelyn's eyes flickered.

"Including..." He paused meaningfully. "Internal documents for next month's international symposium."

A collective gasp filled the room.

After a beat, Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "Deal."

Ethan's smile deepened.
###Chapter 80

"Professor Sullivan, perhaps you should choose a new class representative."

The classroom erupted in murmurs. Several female students gazed longingly at Ethan Sullivan standing at the podium.

"Then we'll decide by lottery."

Ethan's tone was indifferent. His slender fingers swiped lightly across the screen.

Names scrolled rapidly on the display before stopping at one—Sophia Lowell.

Ethan's pupils constricted sharply.

He stared fixedly at the name, his knuckles tightening unconsciously.

Sophia sprang up from her seat, her face alight with triumph. She shot a challenging glance at Evelyn Laurent, her lips curling in victory.

"Which student is Sophia Lowell?"

Ethan's voice remained gentle, but his eyes were icy.

"That's me!" Sophia eagerly stood up, deliberately flashing her sweetest smile.

"From now on, you'll be my class representative."

With that, Ethan turned and left without granting her another glance.

The moment the bell rang, Sophia chased after him to his office.

"Professor Sullivan, may I add your WeChat?" She extended her phone toward him, subtly displaying her delicate wrist.

Ethan impassively scanned the QR code to approve the request.

Sophia's fingers trembled with excitement. This was the heir to the Sullivan Group! She had actually obtained his contact information!

"I look forward to working with you." She took a step closer, her perfume drifting faintly between them.

Ethan suddenly narrowed his eyes. "This necklace..."

His gaze locked onto the silver star pendant around Sophia's neck.

"Huh?" Instinctively, Sophia covered the necklace, her eyes darting. "I've worn this since childhood. It might be something important."

Ethan's breathing noticeably quickened.

"May I see it?"

Sophia sensed his unusual reaction and feigned shyness as she unfastened the necklace to hand it over.

The silver star glimmered with fragmented light under the sun. Ethan's fingertips trembled slightly.
###Chapter 81

Ethan Sullivan's pupils constricted the moment his fingertips touched the necklace.

He flipped the pendant with practiced ease, his thumb tracing the star pattern repeatedly. The tiny diamonds scattered fractured light under the lamplight, but none of it reached the darkness in his eyes.

Three nearly imperceptible letters were engraved inside the pendant—SQN.

The initials of Ethan Sullivan.

This necklace should have been around Evelyn Laurent's neck.

"Professor Sullivan?"

Sophia Lowell's voice dragged him back to reality. She twisted the hem of her shirt nervously, her nails digging into her palms.

Ethan lifted his gaze, the coldness in his eyes vanishing instantly. He handed the necklace back with practiced nonchalance. "It resembles my late mother's keepsake."

"Really?" Sophia pressed urgently. "Then is this one—"

"No." His voice was ice. "My mother never took hers off."

Sophia paled. She ran her fingers over the necklace, her voice trembling. "But I don't remember how I got this..."

"Excuse me."

Ethan turned toward his desk, his retreating figure radiating unmistakable distance.

The moment the door closed, Sophia's expression darkened. She clenched the necklace so tightly her nails scraped against the metal with a grating sound.

Inside his office, Ethan dialed Harrison Whitmore's number.

"Dig up everything on Sophia Lowell," he ordered, voice sharp. "I want a full dossier in ten minutes."

He slammed his fist against the wall after hanging up. The pain in his knuckles was nothing compared to the fury churning inside him.

This necklace shouldn't be here.

And it certainly shouldn't be on Sophia.

Snatching his car keys, he stormed out—only to nearly collide with Evelyn at the hallway corner. The girl staggered back, arms full of documents.

"Professor Sullivan?"

Ethan halted. His throat worked as he took in her clear, guileless eyes. "Class over?"

"Yes." Her gaze dropped to his tense jawline. "You don't look well."

"I'm fine." He started to reach for her hair but aborted the motion midair. "Go home early."

He strode away, his usual composure replaced by uncharacteristic agitation.

Evelyn watched him leave, then absently touched the red cord around her neck. Beneath the knot, there was nothing.
###Chapter 82

Harvard University's Physics Department welcomed a distinguished visiting professor.

Ethan Sullivan.

The name exploded across campus like a detonation.

The university forum servers crashed repeatedly.

"Is Ethan Sullivan really coming to teach us? Is this for real?"

"Absolutely! The Physics Department already posted the schedule!"

"Oh my God! I'm crashing his class!"

Girls' dormitories erupted with shrieks of excitement.

Ethan's legendary reputation spread like wildfire.

The youngest CEO.

A physics prodigy alumnus.

The prince charming in countless girls' dreams.

Now this icon was returning to teach.

Even more shocking—he chose to lecture only twice a month.

"This is highly unusual."

"He rarely accepts speaking engagements."

"Unless..."

A trending post suddenly appeared on the campus forum.

"Rumor has it Evelyn Laurent is enrolled here?"

The thread shot to the top instantly.

"That low-key Lowell heiress?"

"They say she's hiding her identity."

"So Ethan came for his fiancée?"

The speculation spread rapidly.

Meanwhile.

Sophia Lowell sat on her dorm bed.

Her fingers clutched a gleaming silver necklace.

Under a magnifying glass.

Three initials stood out clearly.

E.S.N.

Ethan Sullivan's initials.

Sophia's breathing turned ragged.

Her hands trembled slightly.

"It was him after all..."

A bold scheme took shape in her mind.

She immediately dialed Brandon Lowell.

"Brandon, tell me about Evelyn's childhood."

A derisive snort came through the line.

"Why bother with that bitch?"

Sophia kept her tone sweet.

"Just curious."

Brandon rattled off a few anecdotes impatiently.

Suddenly.

Sophia interrupted.

"Wait! She was kidnapped as a child?"

Her voice spiked sharply.

Her grip tightened around the necklace.

A horrifying realization dawned on her.
###Chapter 83

Brandon Lowell smirked and shrugged indifferently. "Who knows? That bitch disappeared for five days and came back covered in blood."

He spat in disgust. "What bad luck. Why didn't she just die out there?"

He was only ten at the time, but he remembered Evelyn Laurent's disheveled return vividly.

In the Lowell family, Evelyn had always been invisible. Vincent Lowell found her gloomy and called her a worthless burden. With Brandon constantly bullying her, her status was lower than the servants.

For the first two days of her disappearance, Margaret Hill pretended to search for her. But after he distracted her with some whining, the matter was quickly forgotten.

Brandon had hoped she would never return.

Yet five days later, Evelyn crawled back on her own.

A glint flashed in Sophia Lowell's eyes. "Brandon, do you remember the details of her kidnapping?"

"Sis, why do you care?" Brandon frowned in confusion.

That was ancient history—ten years ago.

Besides, Evelyn meant nothing to the Lowells. Vincent couldn't even be bothered to report her disappearance to the police. They just took her to some small clinic to patch her up, afraid she'd die and taint their home.

Somehow, the bitch survived.

But after that, she became even weirder, screaming in the middle of the night. Annoyed, Brandon convinced Vincent to send her to a mental institution before dumping her in the countryside to rot.

After rambling through the story, Brandon hung up impatiently.

Sophia stared at her phone, her nails digging into her palms.

She quickly pulled up Ethan Sullivan's profile, scanning it repeatedly. But his impeccable resume showed no record of any kidnapping.

Either it never happened... or the Sullivans had erased every trace of it.

She had stumbled upon the necklace among Evelyn's old belongings. Its unique design caught her eye, so she kept it. She never imagined it would connect to Ethan.

Sophia's red lips curled into a cold smile.

If Evelyn could use that past to get close to Ethan, why couldn't she?

Her fingers brushed the necklace at her throat, ambition burning in her eyes. If she could secure Ethan, she would crush Evelyn beneath her heels forever.

——

Top floor of Sullivan Group headquarters.

Harrison Whitmore placed a stack of documents on the desk respectfully. "Mr. Sullivan, here's the full background check on Sophia Lowell."

Ethan's long fingers flipped through the pages, his gaze growing colder.

The report showed Sophia had been adopted as a child, excelling academically before being reclaimed by the Lowells and becoming a wealthy heiress.

But there was no mention of any kidnapping.
###Chapter 84

Harrison Whitmore cautiously observed Ethan Sullivan's brooding expression.

"Mr. Sullivan," he ventured, "is there a new lead that prompted you to investigate Sophia Lowell's records?"

He remembered Ethan had previously shown complete indifference toward Sophia.

Ethan's long fingers tapped rhythmically on the desk, his gaze sharp as a blade.

"Dig deeper into Evelyn Laurent's background. I want every detail from her childhood onward."

"Leave no stone unturned."

Harrison hesitated. "But sir, haven't we already reviewed Evelyn's files multiple times?"

When the Lowells had arranged for Evelyn's return, both families had thoroughly vetted her history.

Ethan's lips curled into a cold smile. "Did your reports mention she was a prodigy?"

Harrison fell silent.

He lowered his head awkwardly.

Their investigation showed Evelyn had consistently ranked at the bottom of her class, let alone any connection with Prof. Benjamin Klein.

Ethan's eyes turned glacial. "Investigate again. The more detailed, the better."

Harrison straightened. "Understood!"

Unearthing these old records would be challenging. After leaving, Harrison immediately dispatched teams to San Francisco and Jade Peak to interview those who might remember.

This would be a lengthy inquiry.

But Ethan's orders were absolute. No matter the difficulty, Harrison would execute them flawlessly.

Silence reclaimed the office.

Ethan leaned back in his leather chair, shadows gathering between his brows. He loosened his tie irritably, fingers resuming their restless drumming.

Years of searching had yielded nothing. Now that a lead had surfaced, hesitation crept in.

He feared another dead end.

He feared discovering only that same devastating truth once more.

The mounting frustration became unbearable. Ethan snatched his car keys and strode out.

——

At Harvard University's physics lab, Evelyn Laurent had just set down a test tube when Prof. Benjamin Klein shooed her out.

The professor regarded her with concern. "Evelyn, a girl your age shouldn't spend all day in a lab."

"The world outside is vibrant. No more daily lab marathons."

"Go have fun."

Evelyn blinked in confusion.

Hadn't he gone to great lengths to recruit her?

"Professor, I enjoy experiments," she insisted.

Benjamin's expression turned stern. "Not negotiable. Out you go!"

He valued Evelyn's brilliance, but refused to let a young woman waste her youth among old academics.

The lab door shut firmly behind her.

Evelyn stood in the hallway with a resigned sigh. Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting her slender shadow across the floor.
###Chapter 85

Evelyn Laurent clenched her fists on the bench outside the laboratory.

The humiliating memory of Professor Benjamin Klein ejecting her from the lab still burned fresh.

"Don't set foot in this lab again without my permission."

His words stabbed through her heart like daggers.

She stared at the sealed laboratory door, her eyes tinged red.

No matter how meticulously she'd performed every experiment, the rejection remained inexplicable.

Her phone buzzed, interrupting the spiral of thoughts.

A campus anniversary notification flashed from the Physics Department freshman group chat.

Evelyn dismissed it with one glance.

Festivities held no appeal compared to the precision instruments now denied to her.

Her fingers flew across the screen, accessing the philanthropy website with practiced ease.

One million dollars transferred in seconds.

This ritual had become habit since rejoining the Langley family.

Silk gowns and lavish meals couldn't erase memories of hunger pangs.

The electronic chime confirmed the transaction.

Tucking away her phone, she gazed at the indifferent sky.

Without lab access, only lectures and family obligations remained.

Victoria Langley reveled in this forced domesticity.

"Evelyn darling, join me for afternoon tea?"

"This couture gown was made for you."

"Evelyn..."

She endured her mother's effusions with quiet compliance.

Her quick study of aristocratic graces left no trace of rural upbringing.

Meanwhile, Professor Ethan Sullivan's lectures grew increasingly popular at Harvard.

Sophia Lowell, as class representative, seized every pretext to approach him.

"Professor, I'm struggling with this concept..."

In his office, she clutched her notebook with hopeful eyes.

Ethan's gaze flickered with concealed distaste before settling into academic cordiality.

"Which part troubles you?"

His long fingers tapped the desk absently.

Through the window, his attention drifted to Evelyn walking alone beneath the elms.
###Chapter 86

The notebook lay open on the desk. Sophia Lowell's slender fingers tapped lightly on one page.

"Professor Sullivan, I don't quite understand this part." Her voice dripped with sweetness as she traced circles on the notes.

Ethan Sullivan's gaze swept over the handwriting. His brows knitted tightly. "I explained this three times during last Wednesday's lecture."

His long fingers drummed against the desk with dull thuds.

Sophia's shoulders trembled. Her lashes fluttered rapidly. "Perhaps I'm just too slow..."

She leaned forward abruptly. A wave of overpowering perfume flooded the space between them.

Ethan shot to his feet. His chair screeched against the floor. "Keep your distance when speaking."

His voice carried the chill of winter frost.

Sophia's eyes instantly reddened. Her fingers twisted the hem of her blouse. "I'm sorry, Professor..."

As she bowed her head, the diamond pendant at her collarbone caught the light with a blinding flash.

Ethan's pupils contracted sharply.

"It's just that..." Sophia suddenly looked up, tears glistening in her eyes. "You remind me so much of someone from my past."

A cold laugh escaped Ethan's lips. "That pickup line went out of style a decade ago."

"No!" Sophia clutched the necklace desperately. "This...this was left by the person who saved me."

Her voice cracked. "When I was twelve, after the kidnapping...I woke up wearing this."

The office air turned to ice.

Ethan's knuckles whitened, though his expression remained impassive. "Finished?"

Sophia bit her lip and reached for the notebook. Her wrist "accidentally" knocked over the teacup.

Scalding liquid splashed across Ethan's trousers. "Let me help you—"

As she bent closer, the office door burst open.

Evelyn Laurent leaned against the doorframe. Her sharp gaze flickered between them. "Am I interrupting?"

The corner of her mouth curled in sardonic amusement.

Ethan retreated to the window instantly. His face darkened like a gathering storm.
###Chapter 87

Evelyn's voice was icy.

She pushed open the door just in time to see Sophia practically draped over Ethan.

Ethan stood abruptly, his office chair screeching across the floor.

Sophia's fingers still hovered in the air, mere inches from his collar.

"I—I was just wiping water off Mr. Sullivan's shirt!" Sophia blurted, her voice trembling. "Don't get the wrong idea, Evelyn!"

Evelyn leaned against the doorframe, idly tapping her arm.

Frost gathered in Ethan's eyes. "Shut up."

His gaze swept over Sophia's flushed face with disgust. "You're only making it worse."

Sophia twisted her hem, on the verge of tears. "I didn't want Evelyn to misunderstand—"

"What does that have to do with me?" Evelyn chuckled.

She'd only come to deliver a message.

Her mother had asked her to inform Ethan about tonight's family dinner. Who knew she'd walk in on such a scene?

Her mocking gaze flickered between them.

The Sullivan heir certainly had... unique taste.

That look ignited a fire in Ethan's chest.

This woman always wore that detached expression.

Especially with him.

"Still here?" He shot Sophia a cold glare.

Sophia bit her lip and edged toward the door. As she passed Evelyn, her eyes flashed with venom.

That bitch had ruined everything.

But it didn't matter.

Her fingers brushed the sapphire pendant at her throat, recalling Ethan's sudden change in expression.

This necklace was clearly his weakness.

At the Sullivan patriarch's birthday banquet next week...

Sophia's steps grew lighter as she plotted how to convince her parents to prepare an extravagant gift.

Silence reclaimed the office.

Evelyn crossed her arms, studying Ethan with frost in her eyes.
###Chapter 88

Ethan Sullivan was organizing lecture notes when the office door swung open.

He looked up to see Evelyn Laurent leaning against the doorframe. His brow furrowed. "What is it?"

This marked her first time seeking him out voluntarily.

A mocking smile played on Evelyn's lips. "Seems I interrupted Professor Sullivan's private moment."

"That was her one-sided pursuit." Ethan set down his fountain pen, voice dropping lower. "Sophia Lowell means nothing to me."

"Not my concern." Evelyn twirled her phone carelessly. "Mother wants you for dinner tonight."

She turned to leave without waiting for a response.

"Wait."

Ethan blocked her path with sharp movements. His gaze turned piercing. "That woman isn't worth a second glance."

"Fascinating." Evelyn didn't even blink.

He pulled her inside and shut the door. "Why come to my office directly?"

"No phone number." Her tone remained flat.

Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

After all this time, she hadn't even saved his contact?

"Give me your phone." His voice turned icy.

Evelyn took a half-step back. "Why?"

"To program my number." He enunciated each word. "Now."

She scoffed. "Unnecessary. I prefer no connections with Sophia's playthings."

Disgust flickered in her eyes at the mention of that family.

Ethan's pupils dilated. "I told you there's nothing between us!"

"Wasn't she your handpicked class representative?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

A vein pulsed at Ethan's temple. "The system assigned her randomly!"

"You seemed to enjoy it." Her laugh held no warmth.

During their standoff, Ethan suddenly dialed a number.

Evelyn's phone rang immediately.

"Yes?" She answered without checking.

"Ethan. Sullivan." The words came through gritted teeth.

"Noted." She ended the call and strode away.

Ethan inhaled sharply before grabbing his jacket.

At the campus gates, he clicked his key fob. "Get in."

Evelyn didn't turn. "No need. My driver's here."

A black Maybach glided to the curb. The door opened soundlessly. She slipped inside, leaving Ethan with nothing but the sight of her indifferent back.

###Chapter 89

Ethan Sullivan watched Evelyn Laurent walk away, his knuckles turning white from gripping too hard.

He took a deep breath but ultimately didn't chase after her.

After what she had witnessed today, she must have misunderstood everything.

Sophia Lowell's half-hearted explanation had only poured fuel on the fire.

A cold glint flashed in Ethan's eyes.

A black Maybach was parked at the school gate.

Evelyn checked the license plate before getting in, completely unaware of the icy gaze watching her from behind a tree.

Sophia stared at the retreating car, a smirk curling her lips.

She scrolled through the photos on her phone, her eyes dark with malice.

"Who would've thought, Evelyn? Even a balding old man is fair game for you."

The middle-aged man in the driver's seat stood out starkly in the photos.

Sophia pocketed her phone and turned away.

She would save these photos for the perfect moment.

Not long after the Maybach drove off, Ethan's car followed.

The two vehicles headed toward Beverly Hills one after the other.

The Langley family mansion was brightly lit.

Victoria Langley bustled around the kitchen in an apron, while Richard Langley had surprisingly left work early to help.

Their three sons were also assisting.

"Theodore!" Victoria brandished a spatula and smacked it against his head. "You're crushing the vegetables! What's the point of having you here?"

Theodore dodged with a yelp. "Mom, I'm sorry!"

Richard gave him a dry look. "He can't even tell chives from green onions. You know that."

"Useless." Victoria waved him off dismissively. "Just throw him away."

Theodore was about to protest when his eyes lit up. "Evelyn!"

He dashed over and wrapped his arms around her the moment she stepped inside, nuzzling her like an overgrown puppy. "Did you miss your sixth brother?"

Evelyn laughed and patted his back. "Theodore."

Sebastian approached, holding out a velvet box. "See if you like it."

Inside was a pink diamond bracelet, shimmering under the light.

"Thank you, Sebastian." Her eyes curved into crescents.

Julian reached out and ruffled her hair. "You've gained a little weight. Feels even better now."

His peach-blossom eyes narrowed with satisfaction, like a contented cat.
###Chapter 90

Evelyn's lips curved into a faint smile.

The moment she stepped through the front door, the tension in her nerves instantly melted away.

The overflowing affection from her six brothers and parents wrapped around her like a warm embrace.

"Didn't Ethan come with you?"

Richard's gaze swept past Evelyn, searching the doorway.

"He took his own car. He should be here soon."

As soon as the words left Evelyn's lips, Theodore popped a ripe strawberry into her mouth.

The burst of sweet-tart juice made her eyes crinkle with delight.

"Take the fruit platter to the living room!" Victoria shoved the tray into Theodore's hands. "And stay out of my kitchen!"

Theodore scratched his head sheepishly before obediently leading his sister away.

"Kitchen disaster?" Evelyn teased.

He flashed a boyish grin, revealing his canines. "Don't listen to their nonsense. Try this cherry!"

No way was he losing face in front of his little sister.

Julian suddenly leaned in. "It's not like you can't tell chives from scallions or landed in the ER from instant noodles."

Theodore clenched his fists.

Evelyn burst out laughing.

"Shut it!" Theodore shoved a piece of honeydew into Julian's mouth.

In the kitchen, Sebastian listened to the lively banter, his lips quirking upward unconsciously.

Ever since Evelyn came home, the house had finally come alive.

Victoria watched her bickering sons and beaming daughter with contentment shining in her eyes.

The doorbell rang.

The butler opened the door to reveal Ethan holding an elegant gift box.

"Aunt Victoria, I brought some tea."

"You shouldn't have brought gifts just for dinner. Come in!" She ushered him inside while discreetly studying him—and liking what she saw.

Ethan's gaze immediately zeroed in on Evelyn curled up on the sofa.

"Go join Evelyn and the others." Victoria nudged him toward the living room.

Ethan deliberately maintained distance from Evelyn.

His sharp eyes noticed how her smile vanished the moment he appeared.

"What's wrong, Evie?"

Theodore turned and saw his sister's darkened expression. He immediately glared at Ethan. "Did you upset my sister?"
###Chapter 91

Ethan Sullivan's smile froze on his face.

His gaze instinctively darted toward Evelyn Laurent, panic flashing in his eyes.

They had agreed on this. Why the sudden change?

Ethan desperately tried to catch Evelyn's attention with meaningful looks.

The Langley brothers were infamous for their overprotectiveness, especially Theodore—the most hotheaded of them all. If he thought Ethan had wronged Evelyn, there would be no end to the consequences.

Just as Theodore rolled up his sleeves to charge forward, Evelyn spoke coolly, "Sixth Brother, he didn't bully me."

Theodore's aggressive stance deflated instantly.

He narrowed his eyes at Ethan, unwilling to let it go. "Really? If he dares mistreat you, Evelyn, we'll make him pay."

Evelyn sighed faintly and nodded.

Her sidelong glance at Ethan carried a silent warning.

Ethan inwardly groaned.

She was still hung up on his secret meeting with Sophia Lowell.

He knew Evelyn too well. Her hatred for the Lowell family ran deep—she wanted them gone, though she was biding her time. Sophia's recent provocations had already grated on her nerves.

And yet, he had met with Sophia in private.

All for that necklace—the one that might hold clues about his long-lost sister.

But what if the necklace had originally belonged to Evelyn?

What if Sophia had stolen it from the Langleys?

The thought unsettled him. Evelyn was around the same age as his sister, and something about her felt eerily familiar.

The investigation was ongoing, but records from a decade ago were nearly impossible to trace.

Ethan lowered his lashes, masking the turmoil in his eyes. He sat quietly on the sofa, listening to the siblings' conversation.

Theodore interrogated Evelyn about every detail of her daily life while shoving snacks into her hands. Ethan, the outsider, didn’t even warrant a glance.

Ethan didn’t mind.

His attention remained fixed on Evelyn, trying to catch a glimpse of the spot behind her ear. But her raven-black hair cascaded down, concealing it completely.

"Dinner's ready!"

Victoria Langley's voice rang out from the dining room.

Theodore immediately pulled Evelyn up. "Come on, Evelyn, let's eat!"

The table was laden with meticulously prepared dishes, all made by the Langley family.

Victoria seated Evelyn beside her. Theodore tried to claim the spot to her right, but a sharp look from his mother sent him retreating.

"You sit across from us."

Grumbling, Theodore squeezed between Sebastian and Julian.

Victoria beckoned to Ethan. "Ethan, sit here."

Obligingly, Ethan took the seat next to Evelyn.

A nearly imperceptible frown flickered across Evelyn's face, her eyes glinting with cold displeasure.
###Chapter 92

Ethan Sullivan immediately detected the faint hostility radiating from Evelyn.

A master of emotional concealment, he maintained perfect composure while chatting with Victoria Langley, effortlessly drawing delighted laughter from her.

Across the table, her three brothers glared daggers at Ethan, their resentment almost palpable.

Mom's favoritism knew no bounds!

To his credit, Ethan proved remarkably considerate. Though seated beside Evelyn throughout dinner, he maintained just the right distance, never making her feel uncomfortable.

After the meal, Theodore Langley bounded over with sparkling eyes. "Evelyn! Let's play a game!"

He waved his phone excitedly. "I found this amazing 5v5 competitive game!"

Beyond his obsession with cars, Theodore was a hardcore gaming enthusiast.

Rumors said he was considering going pro.

At nineteen—two years older than Evelyn—he was at peak reaction speed.

"I don't know how to play," Evelyn admitted truthfully.

Growing up without even a smartphone, gaming was foreign to her.

Theodore thumped his chest. "No problem! Your big brother will carry you!"

Unable to refuse his enthusiasm, Evelyn agreed.

Theodore recruited not just Evelyn, but also Sebastian, Julian, and Ethan.

"Perfect five for a full team!" He grinned ear to ear.

But his expression turned teasing when his gaze landed on Ethan. "Little Ethan, at your age...do you even game anymore?"

Ethan's temple twitched.

"Little Ethan"—the nickname grated ever since Theodore learned about their engagement and started playing the overbearing big brother.

And now being called "old"? Ethan fantasized about sewing the brat's mouth shut.

Julian chuckled diplomatically. "Theo's always been like this. Don't take it personally."

Ethan forced a smile. "I'm pretty rusty. Counting on you to carry me, big bro."

Theodore preened. "Watch and learn!"

He swiftly set up Evelyn's account, chose her ID, and launched their first match.

"Just follow my lead!" Theodore cracked his knuckles. "Prepare to witness a slaughterfest!"

Evelyn smiled faintly but didn't immediately follow, instead studying the game mechanics and hero abilities.

The first match was brutal.

Theodore dragged two noobs and two beginners through the wringer, shouting instructions nonstop.

By the second round, Evelyn and Ethan showed shocking improvement, easing Theodore's burden.

Then came the third match...the fourth...

A horrifying realization dawned on Theodore.

Evelyn's gaming talent...was downright terrifying!
###Chapter 93

Evelyn's fingers danced across the screen with practiced ease.

The girl who once couldn't read a map now predicted enemy movements with pinpoint accuracy.

Ethan's gameplay was equally breathtaking.

Theodore watched, stunned, as two novice players dominated the battlefield.

Evelyn's assassin dove past enemy defenses, eliminating targets with surgical precision.

Ethan's warrior took on three opponents at once—emerging victorious with a sliver of health remaining.

Julian's clumsy movements stood in stark contrast.

The Oscar-winning actor was notorious in gaming circles as a walking disaster.

He trembled in the bushes, utterly useless.

After several matches, Theodore's eyes gleamed with excitement.

During the break, he seized Evelyn's wrist. "Eve! Join my esports team!"

"This game's competitive scene is just starting. We need talent like yours—you could win championships!"

His voice shook with enthusiasm.

Her reflexes were extraordinary—almost instinctive. A natural-born gamer.

"Sixth brother, I'm not interested in professional gaming." She gently withdrew her hand.

Theodore immediately turned to Ethan. "What about you?"

Ethan adjusted his cufflinks, lips quirking. "Sullivan Group requires my signature on hundreds of documents daily."

Theodore deflated like a punctured balloon, collapsing onto the sofa.

But he bounced back instantly. "Eve! If you change your mind, I get first dibs!"

Nearby, Sebastian and Julian exchanged exasperated glances.

Julian suddenly spoke up. "Eve, I'm filming a variety show next week. Want to join?"

"No thanks, third brother." Her refusal was immediate.

She hated being in the spotlight.

An awkward silence settled over the living room.

Ethan's phone rang. After the call, he excused himself politely.

Victoria immediately sidled up to her daughter. "Eve, what do you think of Ethan?"

Evelyn's fingers stilled.

She remembered how he'd always appeared when she was in danger during the game.

And that time during her claustrophobia attack—his warm embrace.

Then Sophia's smug smile flashed through her mind.
###Chapter 94

A cold glint flashed in Evelyn's eyes before she quickly replaced it with a gentle smile. "Not bad."

Victoria nodded approvingly. "Theodore has always been sensible since childhood. Now that he's successful in his career, he's a perfect match for our Evelyn."

She had watched Ethan Sullivan grow up and couldn't be more satisfied with the young man.

At least he was far better than her own troublemaking sons!

Theodore scoffed. "He's barely passable as Evelyn's boyfriend."

Sebastian and Julian immediately chimed in. "Just barely."

Victoria shook her head helplessly. "You boys..."

Their devotion to their sister bordered on absurd.

Ever since Evelyn was found after seventeen years missing, they'd wanted to give her the world.

To them, their sister was the brightest star in the sky, the rarest treasure on earth.

Even if Ethan was the youngest billionaire with striking looks and poise, he was merely adequate in their eyes.

Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest.

Over time, she had gradually let her guard down.

The Langleys' love wasn't superficial—it showed in every small gesture.

The thoughtful surprises, the unconditional support—all of it made her feel truly cherished.

"Dad, Mom, brothers... thank you," she murmured, her eyes glistening.

Victoria froze.

Tears welled up instantly, but no words came out.

Even the usually composed Sebastian had reddened as he carefully pulled his sister into an embrace. "We should be the ones thanking you."

His arms trembled slightly, as if struggling to contain his emotions.

As the second son, Sebastian's upbringing hadn't been easy.

Their eldest brother Alexander had been groomed as the heir, subjected to strict expectations. The entire Langley household had been bound by rules and discipline.

It wasn't until the twins Julian and Nathaniel were born that laughter finally filled the home.

With the arrivals of Dominic and Theodore, the family grew even larger.

But Victoria had always carried one regret—she'd wanted a daughter.

If not for that longing, she wouldn't have borne six sons.

When the doctor announced her seventh pregnancy was a girl, the entire Langley family had erupted in joy.

Sebastian would never forget that moment—when his parents told him he'd have a little sister, his heart had swelled with exhilaration.

Even baby Theodore's first word had been "sister."

They poured all their love into this unborn child.

Yet fate played a cruel trick—their baby girl was stolen the day she was born.

Seventeen long years passed before they found her again.
###Chapter 95

The seventeen-year wait felt like an endless nightmare for the Langley family.

Every corner of their home was shrouded in lingering gloom.

Victoria Langley's vanity always displayed a childhood photo of Evelyn Laurent, its frame worn smooth from constant touching.

In Richard Langley's study, stacks of documents about his missing daughter gathered dust—always missing that crucial final page.

Countless nights found Sebastian Langley alone on the balcony, staring blankly at the stars.

They'd tried every method, even consulting mystics, yet their lost princess remained unfound.

Until the police call breathed life back into the Langley household.

Now Evelyn trembled in Sebastian's crushing embrace, her ear pressed against his racing heartbeat.

"We should be thanking you," Richard murmured with uncharacteristic softness, eyes glistening.

The iron-willed tycoon's gaze overflowed with seventeen years of pent-up paternal love.

Evelyn couldn't speak. Her chest burned.

This was the warmth of being truly cherished by family.

Meanwhile, Ethan Sullivan's car tore through Beverly Hills' tree-lined avenues.

Moonlight sharpened his angular profile.

Harrison Whitmore's urgent call had derailed his plans.

"Mr. Sullivan, we've found something."

Harrison stood exhausted in the living room, dark circles under his eyes.

He presented a thick dossier with both hands. "Sophia Lowell's adoptive parents adored her, but she severed ties herself."

"As for Evelyn Laurent..." Harrison swallowed hard. "There were irregularities when she was seven."

Ethan's grip tightened. Paper crunched in protest.

"Irregularities?" His voice turned glacial. "I need proof, not speculation."

Harrison's back prickled with cold sweat.

"The Lowells acted suspiciously," he rushed to explain. "Not reporting their daughter missing for five days—that's unnatural."

Ethan slammed the files onto the coffee table. Glass cracked like a spiderweb.

The room's temperature seemed to plummet.
###Chapter 96

Ethan Sullivan's knuckles turned white, veins pulsing faintly at his temples. His eyes burned with a terrifying storm as he stared at the investigation report.

"Find out." His voice was dangerously low. "Why didn't Vincent Lowell report it to the police back then? Why didn't he look for Evelyn?"

Harrison Whitmore's back broke out in a cold sweat. He straightened immediately. "Understood!"

He retreated from the study, barely daring to breathe.

In the hallway, Harrison wiped his forehead. After years by Ethan's side, he'd rarely seen the usually composed man lose control like this.

Ethan always wore a flawless mask—calculating in business, charming in social settings. But now, that facade had shattered completely.

Inside the study, Ethan slammed the report onto the desk. Papers scattered across the floor, revealing a childhood photo of Evelyn.

The little girl in the picture looked timid, her frail frame a stark contrast to the opulence of the Lowell mansion.

Ethan closed his eyes briefly.

He picked up the documents again, fingers trembling.

Sophia Lowell's records showed she'd been doted on since childhood, never experiencing abduction. But Evelyn's file was a knife twisting in his heart.

At seven, Evelyn had gone missing for five days. Yet the Lowells took Brandon on vacation. When Evelyn returned alone—bruised and battered—she was met only with scolding.

"Why didn't you just die out there?"

The words exploded in Ethan's mind. His fist clenched violently, nails digging deep into his palm.

Records showed Evelyn had returned in a daze, prone to screaming fits. The family, unable to tolerate her distress, sent her to a psychiatric hospital.

Ethan's chest heaved. He remembered the flicker of terror in Evelyn's eyes when they first met.

"Was it you...?" he murmured. "That little girl from back then..."

Outside, dark clouds gathered. The rumble of distant thunder signaled an approaching storm.
###Chapter 97

Ethan Sullivan's fingers trembled slightly over the documents.

He remembered the icy glare Evelyn Laurent gave him when he tentatively asked about the psychiatric hospital.

"Ethan, you've crossed the line."

Those words stabbed through his heart like a knife.

Just reading these records made it hard to breathe.

And Evelyn had lived through it all.

Those days locked in dark rooms had given her crippling claustrophobia.

Bang!

He slammed the files onto the desk.

His chest heaved violently.

Everything he'd uncovered before had been whitewashed.

Now the brutal truth lay exposed, choking him like an invisible hand around his throat.

Vincent Lowell and his family were absolute monsters.

Sophia Lowell was no better.

Gritting his teeth, he picked up the documents again with shaking hands.

He read every word detailing Evelyn's childhood.

The pain hidden beneath a calm facade.

Her family's cruelty had left deep scars.

That's why she armored herself like a porcupine.

Even the Langley family had faced her wariness at first.

Only their patient love had slowly melted her defenses.

Now Evelyn could accept her real family.

But him...

Ethan suddenly stood, grabbing his car keys.

"Monarch Lounge. Bring Xander."

Oliver Valentine barely processed the call before it disconnected.

The black sports car roared out of the garage like an arrow.

Oliver blinked, then dialed another number.

"Xander, get to Monarch now!"

"Miss me already, Ollie?" Xander Quincy's lazy voice drawled.

"It's Ethan!"

In the KTV booth, Xander pushed away the girl clinging to him.

"Emergency. Gotta go."

All traces of playfulness vanished from his face.
###Chapter 98

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Landon Croix rose leisurely from bed.

He tied his tie with meticulous precision before the mirror.

At the breakfast table, he slowly savored his soy milk and fried dough sticks as if it were any ordinary day.

Yet a vigilant gleam flickered in the depths of his eyes.

He knew the County Discipline Commission agents were watching his every move from the shadows.

Meanwhile, in the temporary detention cell, Leonard Croix jolted awake.

Rubbing his sore neck, he glanced at the wall clock—already past nine.

"Guards! Bring me cigarettes!" he bellowed.

A cold voice responded from outside: "Stay put!"

"I demand a smoke!" Leonard kicked the metal bed with a deafening clang. "This is illegal detention!"

His three sons woke next door and immediately joined the shouting.

The hallway descended into chaos.

When Terrence Ashford and Gideon Ashford arrived, two officers were pinning Leonard to the floor.

"What happened?" Terrence frowned.

"He demanded cigarettes," an officer reported wearily.

Gideon smirked. "Think this is your living room?"

"Who the hell do you think you are?" Leonard snarled, glaring up at Gideon.

Tension crackled between them like live wires.

Finally, Terrence waved a hand. "Give him a cigarette."

Leonard took it greedily, inhaling deeply.

As smoke curled around him, his eyes darkened with calculation.

He remembered his eldest son's instructions—deny everything if arrested, then implicate Bronson Maddox at dawn.

"Landon must have everything under control by now," he thought.

The ashtray filled with stubs.

Beads of sweat formed on Leonard's forehead.

Suddenly stubbing out his cigarette, he barked, "I demand to see Terrence Ashford!"

An officer glared. "The Chairman isn't at your beck and call."

"I have a confession!" Leonard stood abruptly. "Can you afford the consequences of delaying justice?"

Ten minutes later, Terrence entered with a stenographer.

Leonard suddenly adopted an officious tone. "Chairman Ashford, I'm still the village chief. Show some respect."

Terrence clenched his jaw. "Chief Croix, get to the point."

"I'm hungry." Leonard rubbed his stomach. "And so are my sons. You can't starve us."

Gideon gritted his teeth as Terrence signaled for breakfast.

An eerie silence settled over the interrogation room.

Leonard narrowed his eyes, plotting his next move.

The real game had only just begun.
###Chapter 99

Ethan Sullivan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, the cigarette between his fingers burned down to the filter.

He never imagined things would turn out this way.

Evelyn Laurent's past was like a blunt knife, sawing relentlessly at his heart.

"So..." Oliver Valentine cautiously broke the silence. "Who is she really?"

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed as ash fluttered from his cigarette.

"Evelyn Laurent."

The name slipped out like a sigh, freezing the entire private room in an instant.

Xander Quincy's glass slammed onto the table with a crack, amber liquid splashing onto his designer suit. "Your fiancée is the one you've been searching for?" His eyes widened in disbelief. "This is too..."

Oliver's face turned ashen. "Did you tell her about Cici?"

Ethan silently crushed the cigarette butt, the ember leaving a searing mark on his palm.

Oliver sucked in a sharp breath.

Game over.

He could already picture Ethan kneeling on a bed of nails begging for forgiveness.

Someone as proud as Evelyn would never accept being a stand-in.

Even if the stand-in was the original.

"Just go after her," Xander drawled, crossing his legs. "The engagement's already in place."

Ethan's gaze turned glacial.

"I won't force her."

Each word dripped with ice.

Xander shrugged with feigned nonchalance. "Suit yourself." He swirled his drink with a smirk. "Not like I've ever had to chase—"

CRACK!

Ethan's fist smashed into the coffee table.

A spiderweb of fractures spread across the glass.

"Say one more word."

Xander shot to his feet, face darkening. "Have you lost your damn mind, Sullivan?"

Oliver hastily stepped between them. "Both of you, calm down!"

Ethan gave a cold laugh before yanking Oliver backward by his collar. "Let's settle this."

The hum of machinery echoed from behind a hidden door.

Xander tore off his tie and followed. "Bring it on!"

Oliver's wail trailed down the hallway. "I don't want to referee—"

FVossrescent lights flickered on in the shooting range, illuminating three men squared off like dueling pistols.
###Chapter 100

Gunshots echoed through the shooting range.

Ethan Sullivan's slender fingers gripped the trigger with steady precision. His hawk-like gaze never wavered. He always came here to vent his frustrations. Today was no exception.

"Have you both lost your minds? Using me as target practice?"

Oliver Valentine stood twenty meters away, trembling beneath an apple balanced on his head. His bulletproof vest was soaked with sweat, making him look like a walking bullseye.

Xander Quincy adjusted his scope with mechanical precision. The cold clink of metal filled the air.

"Begin."

At Ethan's command, two shots rang out simultaneously.

Bullets sliced through the air, striking dead center. Ethan's movements flowed like water, each shot perfectly aligned, the holes nearly overlapping.

The moving target activated.

Ethan's eyes narrowed. His fingers danced on the trigger as bullets chased the shifting target, leaving flawless patterns.

"Final round."

Xander's voice carried stubborn defiance.

Both men raised their weapons, aiming at the wobbling apple atop Oliver's head.

"Hey! You can't—"

Oliver's protest was cut off by gunfire.

"Bang!"

The apple exploded.

"Ah!" Oliver crouched, clutching his forehead. "Xander, you missed!"

First round: Ethan's flawless victory.

Xander's face darkened. "Again."

Ethan smirked coldly. "Bring it."

Oliver fumbled for his phone. "Julian! Get to Monarch Lounge now! These lunatics are trying to kill me!"

The second round escalated.

Paint pellets splattered across Oliver's body in vibrant bursts. He darted around like a rainbow-colored rabbit.

"What the hell?"

The private room door burst open. Julian Langley stormed in, surveying the chaos before locking eyes with Ethan.

Ethan's gun arm dropped.

Xander seized the moment, nailing Oliver's forehead with a paint round. "I win," he gloated.

"What are you doing?" Julian demanded, stepping closer.

Ethan stared at the floor, voice rough. "She won't talk to me."

"Who?"

"Evelyn."

Julian froze. He studied Ethan's red-rimmed eyes and suddenly understood.

"You hurt my sister?"

Ethan shook his head like a chastened child. "Someone framed me... She misunderstood."

The rare vulnerability in his voice left Julian speechless.

An eerie silence filled the room.

Finally, Julian gritted his teeth. "Ethan, your acting puts my Oscar to shame."
###Chapter 101

Julian Langley glared coldly at Ethan Sullivan.

The man's acting skills were truly masterful.

"Would winning an Oscar make Evelyn Laurent talk to me?" Ethan's voice was hoarse. "Then I'd gladly accept it."

Julian nearly laughed in disbelief.

The sheer audacity of this man.

He studied Ethan with a frown.

The transformation was startling.

When Ethan had kicked the door open earlier, the stench of alcohol had hit Julian like a wave.

Ethan had drunk the most, his entire body reeking of liquor, his cheeks flushed from the fight. Yet his eyes were terrifyingly clear.

Julian couldn't tell if this was drunken nonsense or genuine confession.

"Get lost," he snapped, waving a dismissive hand. "You've already taken every advantage."

His gaze swept over the two drunkards. "If you keep causing trouble, I'll call Nathaniel back."

Xander Quincy jolted. "No! Don't bother Fourth Brother!"

"You call him 'Little Four'?" Julian narrowed his eyes.

Xander immediately turned sycophantic. "Third Brother! You're my real brother!" He grabbed Julian's arm, the alcohol fumes making Julian recoil.

In the end, Julian became their designated driver.

At least they all lived in Beverly Hills.

When they reached the Sullivan estate, Ethan suddenly dug in his heels. "I want to see Evelyn."

"She's asleep," Julian said coldly.

Ethan's eyes darkened. Silently, he stepped out of the car.

His walk was perfectly straight, showing no sign of intoxication.

Julian watched his retreating figure until the butler came to receive him.

The moment Julian stepped through his own front door, Victoria Langley raised her feather duster. "You went drinking?"

"Mom! I didn't drink!" Julian stood at attention. "It was Ethan and the others!"

"Ethan knows how to drink?" Victoria scoffed.

"I drove them home!" Julian protested.

The feather duster finally lowered.

Julian exhaled in relief.

Even an Oscar-winning actor had to be an obedient son at home.
###Chapter 102

Evelyn Laurent curled up in the corner of the sofa, her lips curling into an unconscious smile. Theodore Langley grinned beside her, his eyes crinkling with mirth.

Her almond-shaped eyes curved into crescents, radiant as if bathed in sunlight.

"Ethan Sullivan drinks alcohol?" Evelyn tilted her head in question.

Julian Langley blinked in surprise.

"Of course he does!" He recovered quickly. "He holds his liquor well, though he usually abstains. Today he went wild—not only drinking but challenging Xander Quincy to a shooting match."

Julian clicked his tongue. "They had fun, but poor Oliver Valentine nearly got turned into Swiss cheese."

The four elite families—Langley, Sullivan, Valentine, and Quincy—had maintained close ties for generations. Their heirs grew up together, with Ethan and Xander always using Oliver as target practice. Over the years, Oliver had become quite adept at dodging bullets.

Victoria Langley narrowed her eyes and grabbed her feather duster. "Julian Langley, since when do you lie so brazenly?"

"Mom! I'm telling the truth!" Julian hopped in agitation. "Call Vincent Sullivan if you don't believe me! Ethan must be reeking of alcohol by now!"

Victoria actually dialed the number.

The Sullivan mansion blazed with light.

When the butler helped Ethan inside, Vincent Sullivan was reviewing documents. The pungent alcohol smell made his head snap up.

Ethan's suit was disheveled, his gaze unfocused.

"You've been drinking?" Vincent stood abruptly.

"Yeah." Ethan responded flatly.

"What's gotten into you?" Though his tone was stern, concern flickered in Vincent's eyes as he signaled the butler.

The butler shook his head helplessly. The young master never touched alcohol, yet tonight he was thoroughly drunk.

Ethan moved silently toward the stairs, his steps steady but his stare vacant.

"Support him properly!" Vincent called after them anxiously.

The butler hurried to assist.

Back in his bedroom, Ethan locked the door and retrieved the woven charm bracelet from his drawer's depths. Pressing it to his cheek, he whispered, "Evelyn..."

The next moment, he collapsed onto the bed clutching the bracelet, sinking into deep slumber.
###Chapter 103

Ethan Sullivan was jolted awake by blinding sunlight.

His eyes flew open. A dull throbbing pulsed at his temples. Every muscle in his body ached as if he'd been run over by a truck.

He instinctively raised a hand to rub his temple—then froze. His right fist was clenched around something.

The woven charm bracelet glimmered faintly in the morning light.

Memories crashed over him like a tidal wave.

Ethan's pupils constricted violently. His grip on the bracelet turned white-knuckled. Fragmented scenes from last night's drunken stupor flashed through his mind—especially the words he'd said to Julian Langley.

"Damn it."

He cursed under his breath, raking a hand through his disheveled hair. The stench of alcohol clung to his wrinkled shirt.

Steam fogged the bathroom mirror.

Hot water cascaded over Ethan's tense muscles as he stood motionless under the shower. He inhaled sharply before opening his eyes, resolve flashing in their depths.

If Evelyn Laurent really was his lost Xi Xi...

The thought made his pulse accelerate. He would never let her slip away again.

Vincent Sullivan was reading the newspaper when Ethan descended the stairs.

"Dad, I'm heading out."

Ethan strode past without stopping for breakfast.

Vincent lowered the paper, watching his son's retreating back with knowing eyes. Only after the front door slammed did he set the newspaper aside, an unconscious smile tugging at his lips.

"You seem pleased this morning, sir?"

The butler approached with a tea tray.

"Harrison," Vincent accepted the cup, "have you ever seen Ethan drunk before?"

The older man shook his head. "The young master has always been exceedingly disciplined."

"Precisely." Vincent sipped his tea, eyes glinting shrewdly. "Someone made him lose control."

Their gazes met in silent understanding.

——

The black Maybach tore through city streets.

Ethan activated his Bluetooth headset, voice glacial. "Report."

"Got everything." Harrison Whitmore's voice carried faint moans in the background. "Miss Evelyn Laurent was indeed kidnapped years ago. The Lowells knew and deliberately concealed—"

A muffled thud interrupted him.

"Continue." Ethan's eyes darkened dangerously.

"She escaped on her own. After returning, she wore a necklace constantly until it somehow got lost. As for where she was held..." Harrison paused. "Miss Evelyn herself doesn't remember."

Ethan slammed the brakes.

Tires screeched against asphalt.

"Confirmed?"

"Verified through...persuasive methods." Harrison glanced at the barely conscious Vincent Lowell. "He wouldn't dare lie now."

Ethan's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel.

Memory loss... This complication he hadn't anticipated.
###Chapter 104

Harrison Whitmore would really beat him if he refused to cooperate.

The fist came at Vincent Lowell's face with a whoosh of wind.

Darkness swam before his eyes.

He'd never seen such brutal precision—every punch landed exactly where it hurt most.

"I'll talk! I'll talk!" Vincent finally screamed, breaking down.

His entire body trembled, blood seeping from the corner of his mouth.

Only then did Harrison stop, standing coldly before him.

Vincent couldn't see the man's face behind the sunglasses and mask, but he knew someone far more terrifying must be pulling the strings.

"It... it was Sophia Lowell's idea..." Vincent gasped out between labored breaths.

A glacial glint flashed in Harrison's eyes.

Without a word, he unleashed another savage beating.

By the time Ethan Sullivan arrived, Vincent was barely clinging to life.

Ethan pushed open the door, a baseball bat in hand.

The air in the room froze instantly.

"Mr... Mr. Sullivan..." Vincent's eyes widened in terror.

The bat came down with a whistling arc.

"Agh—"

A bloodcurdling scream echoed through the cramped space.

Vincent's right leg twisted at a grotesque angle.

His eyes rolled back from the pain before he passed out again.

Ethan wiped his hands expressionlessly.

"Throw him back."

Harrison nodded immediately. "Understood."

The black sedan sped through the night.

Margaret Hill paced anxiously in the living room.

A dull thud suddenly sounded from outside.

She opened the door and nearly fainted from shock.

"Vincent!"

Her husband lay crumpled on the doorstep like a broken doll, drenched in blood.

Hands shaking, Margaret dialed 911, then called her daughter. "Sophia! Come home now! Something's happened to your father!"

Meanwhile, Sophia was hiding behind a tree.

Her hate-filled gaze bored into Evelyn Laurent's retreating figure.

Her phone suddenly rang.

"What?!" Sophia's face drained of color.

With one last venomous glare at Evelyn, she turned and sprinted away.

Who dared lay a hand on her father?

Could it be... had Ethan discovered something?
###Chapter 105

The red light above the operating room glared ominously.

Margaret Hill paced the corridor, her knuckles white from gripping her purse strap.

Brandon Lowell slumped on the bench, staring blankly at the floor.

"Mom!" Sophia Lowell's heels clicked rapidly as she approached. "How's Dad?"

Margaret seized her daughter's wrist. "He never came home last night. This morning someone dumped him at our doorstep and ran..."

Her nails dug into Sophia's flesh.

Sophia frowned and pulled away. "Did you call the police?"

"The cameras caught nothing." Margaret's voice trembled. "They knew all the blind spots..."

Brandon suddenly looked up. "Sis, is Dad gonna die?"

Dried blood still streaked his face.

Sophia's stomach clenched.

She studied her mother and brother with calculated detachment.

Margaret's makeup had smeared, her expensive fur coat stained. Brandon's limited-edition sneakers were scuffed beyond recognition.

"Mom, calm down." Sophia handed her a tissue. "Did Dad make any enemies recently?"

Margaret grabbed her shoulders. "Did you cause trouble somewhere?"

Sophia's pupils contracted.

The operating room doors swung open.

"The patient is stable for now." The doctor removed his mask. "But we need to monitor him for 48 hours."

When Vincent Lowell was wheeled out, his face was swollen beyond recognition.

Sophia covered her mouth, summoning perfectly timed tears.

She assessed her adoptive father's battered form with cold efficiency.

Her true identity as the Langley heiress remained undisclosed.

There was still time to cut ties.

"I have class." She wiped her tears. "Call me if anything changes."

Outside the hospital, Sophia dialed a number.

"Find out who's targeting the Lowells."

Hanging up, she gazed at the bustling street.

Ethan Sullivan preferred gentle, kindhearted girls.

An ICU-bound father simply wouldn't do.
###Chapter 106

Ethan Sullivan's car idled outside Harvard University's southern gate.

The engine had just quieted when his window slid halfway down.

His slender fingers rested on the steering wheel. His gaze pierced through the campus gates toward distant lecture halls.

That birthmark festered like a thorn in his heart.

His phone screen flickered on and off. After three attempts, he finally sent the invitation.

"Ding—"

Evelyn Laurent's reply came swiftly, laced with familiar detachment.

Ethan stared at the question mark, his knuckles whitening. He could practically see her arched brow and mocking smirk.

When he typed his full name, his lips twisted in self-deprecation.

The rejection came instantly.

Only after promising "I won't take much of your time" did she reluctantly agree. Ethan's tense shoulders finally relaxed against the leather seat. The window reflected his faint smile.

"Professor Sullivan?"

A saccharine voice shattered the silence. Sophia Lowell approached, her diamond necklace glinting obnoxiously in the sunlight.

The Sullivan family heirloom.

Ethan's eyes turned glacial. His stare sliced across her throat like a blade. "Take it off."

Sophia pretended not to understand, adjusting the necklace deliberately. "But Mother said—"

"Last warning." The window descended fully, unleashing winter air. "Unless you want me to remove it myself."

Class bells chimed in the distance.

Evelyn appeared at the tree-lined path's end, her black hoodie accentuating porcelain skin. She kicked a stray pebble absently, glancing up just as Sophia fumbled with the necklace.

"Tch."

That derisive sound made Ethan whirl. Twenty meters away, the faint red mark behind Evelyn's ear burned into his vision.

Like a blooming rose.
###Chapter 107

Sophia Lowell lurked beneath the tree shadows, her gaze venomously locked onto Evelyn Laurent in the distance.

Her fingers instinctively brushed against her still-swollen cheek, a flash of malice flickering in her eyes.

That bitch must be expelled from Harvard University.

What disturbed her more was the unmistakable look Evelyn had given Ethan Sullivan during their last encounter in the office.

She'd combed through every forum post until they were memorized.

Evelyn was Professor Benjamin Klein's prized protégé, Ethan's junior in their academic lineage.

So what?

Sophia dug her nails deep into her palms until crescent marks formed.

She refused to believe Ethan would ever fancy some country bumpkin from the sticks.

At the university gates, Evelyn glanced around impatiently.

Weren't they supposed to meet at the south entrance?

The black Maybach glided to a smooth stop beside her.

The tinted window lowered, revealing Ethan's sharply defined profile.

"Get in."

His deep voice carried an edge of command that brooked no refusal.

As Evelyn pulled open the car door, a faint gasp echoed from afar.

Sophia stood frozen, trembling violently.

She recognized that car!

Ethan had claimed urgent business earlier—yet here he was, personally fetching Evelyn?

Impossible!

Her knuckles turned white as she clutched the pendant at her throat.

When had Evelyn climbed into the Sullivan family's orbit?

Could those rumors about her being...?

"No!" Sophia shook her head violently. "She's just white trash!"

With shaking hands, she pulled out her phone and dialed.

"Dean Evans? It's Sophia..."

A twisted smile spread across her face as she ended the call.

Evelyn Laurent, this time I'll bury you for good.

——

The car interior carried a faint trace of ambergris.

Evelyn watched the blurring cityscape through the window. "What's this about?"

Ethan's grip tightened slightly on the steering wheel.

"Dinner first."

He took her to an exclusive Chef's Table tucked away from public view.

Red plum blossoms peeked over the gray brick walls.
###Chapter 108

Ethan Sullivan pushed open the private dining room door. Warm golden light spilled across the dark hardwood table.

Evelyn Laurent strode directly to the window seat in her stilettos, fingertips tapping the tabletop. "Cut to the chase, Mr. Sullivan."

A server placed two glasses of lemon water between them. Condensation slid down the chilled surfaces.

"The engagement." Ethan unbuttoned his suit jacket as he sat, his Adam's apple bobbing.

Evelyn's head snapped up, dark hair sweeping her shoulders. "Found your unrequited love?"

His fingers absently traced the rim of his glass. "Possibly—"

"Fantastic!" She clapped suddenly, delight brightening her features. "Shall we terminate the engagement tomorrow?"

The glass tipped abruptly, spreading a dark stain across the linen tablecloth.

Ethan's breath caught as he noticed the faint pink birthmark behind her ear. That butterfly-shaped mark glowed under the ambient lighting.

"You—" His voice tightened. He stood so abruptly his chair toppled over.

Evelyn leaned back warily. "What's gotten into you?"

Instead of answering, he circled behind her and flung open the window. Night air rushed in, carrying osmanthus fragrance and ruffling his disheveled bangs.

"Too warm." The excuse came out hoarse, but his gaze remained locked on that telltale mark.

The little girl from the rainstorm a decade ago now sat before him—eager to sever their connection.

"So when exactly are we dissolving this arrangement?" Evelyn tapped her watch impatiently.

Ethan suddenly seized her wrist. "What if I told you—"

"Hmm?"

His words died as he drowned in her clear eyes. That damned contract between them might as well be a blade, mocking his past foolishness.

"Food's getting cold." He released her mechanically, returning to his seat.

Evelyn frowned at his erratic behavior. "Don't tell me you're having second thoughts."

The chandelier's light fractured into icy shards in his eyes. "Eat first."

"Ethan!" She stood abruptly, her napkin fluttering to the floor. "Are you toying with me?"

Fireworks exploded outside, illuminating his ashen face. After ten years of searching, his answer now trembled on his lips—yet remained unspoken.

###Chapter 109

Flames ignited in Evelyn Laurent's eyes.

Her gaze locked onto Ethan Sullivan like a dagger, her fingernails digging into her palms.

That piercing stare seemed capable of tearing through his facade, exposing every buried secret.

Ethan tapped the table with elegant fingers. "The candidate still needs verification. The engagement termination must wait for the right moment."

"Patience is key."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes.

She sensed a shift in his expression—something hidden, something unspoken.

Ethan had already regained his composure, lifting his teacup with effortless grace. "There's another matter. About Vincent Lowell."

Evelyn's face froze.

Just hearing that name made her stomach churn.

"His legs were broken. He's hospitalized now," Ethan said casually, a faint smirk playing on his lips.

Evelyn's eyes brightened. "Which hero did the world that favor?"

Her undisguised glee drew a low chuckle from Ethan.

If it pleased her, he wouldn't mind delivering a few more kicks himself.

But her suspicion flared. "How do you know about this?"

Ethan paused mid-motion, adjusting his response. "I have investments in that hospital."

"Oh."

Evelyn's attention was already stolen by the aroma of arriving dishes.

She eagerly grabbed a piece of sweet and sour ribs, cheeks puffing as she chewed.

Ethan subtly slid the dishes she favored closer. "Slow down."

He had ordered a dozen signature dishes, each portion meticulously small.

This was his test—to learn her tastes.

That rainy night a decade ago, this girl had given him a second chance at life.

Now reunited, he would lay the world's finest treasures at her feet.

When Evelyn finally set down her chopsticks, she met Ethan's gaze—soft enough to melt glaciers.

She shuddered. "Did you poison the food?"

Ethan laughed outright.

Then he leaned forward abruptly. "Evelyn, what exactly is your grudge against Vincent Lowell?"
###Chapter 110

Evelyn's fingernails dug into her palms the moment Ethan uttered the name "Vincent Lowell."

Her gaze turned glacial. "That entire family deserves to die."

Ethan studied her reaction carefully. "Do you need me to handle them for you?"

"No." Her refusal was absolute. "I'll settle this debt with them personally."

The warm restaurant lights cast shadows across her tense profile.

Ethan swallowed hard. "Did they...treat you badly?"

A cold laugh escaped her lips as she stared into the darkness beyond the window.

Suddenly, exhaustion weighed on her—perhaps from the exquisite steak, or maybe Ethan's uncharacteristically gentle expression.

"I'll never forgive them." Her voice was feather-light. "Why should I have endured all that?"

His fingers tightened unconsciously. "Can you tell me...about your childhood?"

Evelyn leaned back against the sofa, her hollow eyes fixed on the ceiling.

"Just the tired old tale of favoring sons over daughters." Her tone was eerily calm. "Brandon was their golden child, while I...was worth less than a dog."

Ethan's heart constricted painfully.

"Your claustrophobia..." He struggled to form the words. "Was it from that kidnapping?"

Her head snapped toward him, eyes sharp as daggers.

"I don't remember." Her lips twisted. "But I'll never forget being locked in that psychiatric ward's solitary confinement."

Her fingers began trembling uncontrollably.

That episode in the pitch-black bathroom had confirmed one thing—the terror never truly left.

Ethan's breathing grew ragged. "You were actually...kidnapped?"

"Five days." Her voice could freeze hell itself. "When I finally escaped, they said..."

Her nails drew blood from her own arms. "They wished I'd died out there."

The restaurant lights suddenly felt blinding. Evelyn narrowed her eyes.

"That day, I made a vow." Each word was measured and lethal. "I'll make them repay what they owe me—tenfold."
###Chapter 111

Ethan's knuckles turned white, his palms marked with crescent-shaped indentations from his nails.

He gazed at Evelyn Laurent, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Did it hurt badly back then?"

Her fingertips trembled slightly.

The emotion in Ethan's eyes felt achingly familiar—the same look her family gave her after every nightmare.

Not pity. Just heartache.

She turned away. "It doesn't matter now."

"Vincent Lowell will pay in blood."

An invisible fist clenched around Ethan's heart.

Never had he felt this out of control, this close to shattering reason and pulling the stubborn girl into his arms.

"I'll help you," he rasped.

Evelyn whirled back. "Stay away from Sophia."

Ethan stepped forward urgently. "There's nothing between us!"

"If I'm lying, may every wish I ever make turn to dust."

The intensity of his stare burned the tips of Evelyn's ears.

"Who asked for your oath?" she muttered, rising to leave.

Watching her flustered retreat, Ethan's lips curved unbidden.

So that's what bothered her.

"Evelyn!" His voice halted her mid-turn.

Backlit by sunlight, her hair glowed like spun gold. "When are we ending this engagement?"

Ethan's smile froze.
###Chapter 112

The words "break off the engagement" left Evelyn Laurent's lips again.

Ethan Sullivan felt his temples throb violently.

He suppressed the storm of emotions rising in his chest, his Adam's apple bobbing. "You'll see when the time comes."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened like a blade. "Ethan, you promised you wouldn't go back on your word."

Ethan fell silent.

The pit he'd dug for himself was too deep—now it had become his own prison.

How could he fix this?

Before he could think of a solution, Evelyn suddenly smiled. "I trust Mr. Sullivan is a man of his word."

With that, she turned and walked away.

This time, her retreating figure was resolute and final.

That phrase—"a man of his word"—echoed in Ethan's mind like a curse.

He took a deep breath, steadying the rapid rise and fall of his chest.

He'd buy himself time. He wouldn't let her go.

Ethan's eyes darkened as he turned toward the parking lot.

Evelyn walked along the sidewalk, the early spring breeze carrying a slight chill.

Ethan's words clung to her like a brand.

Annoyed, she shook her head and quickened her pace toward Harvard University.

A black Maybach pulled up beside her.

The window rolled down, revealing Ethan's sharply defined profile. "Get in. I'll give you a ride."

Evelyn instinctively took a step back. "No, thanks. I'd rather walk."

"Three kilometers," Ethan said, eyes fixed ahead. "I have business at Harvard too."

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn opened the car door.

An awkward silence filled the vehicle.

Ethan's grip on the steering wheel tightened slightly. The rearview mirror reflected Evelyn's distant expression.

He sighed inwardly.

The car stopped at Harvard's south gate.

Evelyn practically fled the vehicle, rushing into the campus without a backward glance.

Ethan watched her retreating figure, a bitter smile tugging at his lips.

Only when she disappeared around the corner of a building did his expression darken.

Thoughts of the Lowell family's mess made his eyes flash with fury.

He dialed Harrison Whitmore. "Teach Brandon Lowell a lesson. Just don't kill him."

"Understood," Harrison replied crisply.

That afternoon, Sophia Lowell was studying in the library when her phone vibrated.

Margaret Hill's sobs came through the receiver. "Sophia! Your brother's been beaten up!"

Sophia frowned. "I'm studying for midterms."

"How can you be so heartless?" Margaret shrieked. "Your brother could be dying!"

Sophia hung up and silenced her phone.

She stared at her textbook, but the words blurred before her eyes.

What trouble had that idiot brother gotten himself into this time?
###Chapter 113

The Lowell family's misfortunes kept piling up, stretching Sophia's nerves to the breaking point.

She paced her dorm room, phone clutched in a white-knuckled grip. The screen displayed a message from Brandon—another major client had pulled out.

"Damn it!" She hurled the phone onto the bed with a snarl.

The mirror reflected her contorted expression. Ever since returning to the Lowells, bad luck clung to her like a curse. The glamorous heiress life she'd envisioned had disintegrated into chaos.

What galled her most was the involuntary tremors that seized her whenever she saw Evelyn. That bitch played dirty.

"This has to be her doing." Sophia glared at the oak tree outside, suddenly recalling the sight of Evelyn climbing into Ethan's car.

Her chest constricted.

The Sullivan Group... If Ethan got involved...

"Impossible!" She shook her head violently, nails screeching against the windowsill. How could trash like Evelyn catch the eye of someone like him?

The classroom door creaked open, interrupting her spiral.

Evelyn entered with pallid skin and faint shadows under her eyes. Sophia's lips curled in malicious delight.

"Got dumped, didn't you?" The thought sent her fingers clawing grooves into her textbook.

The professor's lecture faded into white noise as Sophia fantasized about ruining Evelyn. Only when the bell rang did she realize the room had emptied—except for Evelyn solving equations at her desk.

Opportunity knocked.

She slipped out silently, retrieving a prepped padlock from her bag.

Two metallic clicks secured both exits.

"Enjoy your stay, dear sister." Sophia smirked at the locked door before nearly colliding with a girl carrying files.

"What're you staring at?" She bared her teeth, storming off.

Inside, Evelyn stretched her stiff neck. Sunset stretched her shadow across the floor.

The door didn't budge when she tried it.

"Childish." She eyed the chain on the back exit with disdain.

Without hesitation, she vaulted through the window, landing soundlessly on the grass.

"Evelyn!"

A ponytailed girl sprinted toward her.

"It is you!" The girl beamed. "Remember me? Vivian Ho!"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed in recognition.

"Cousin?"

Vivian moved to link arms but met empty air.

"I just transferred to Harvard! Never thought I'd bump into you here." Undeterred, she grinned. "Come on, my treat!"

Evelyn studied Vivian's outstretched hand—and froze at the familiar scar on her wrist.

A decade-old wound from when Vivian shielded her.

"Alright." Her voice softened slightly.
###Chapter 114

Evelyn Laurent gazed at the radiantly smiling woman before her, a complex emotion stirring in her heart.

Margaret Hill blinked her large, dewy eyes, her tone laced with playful coquetry. "Evelyn, darling, you're not still upset with me, are you?"

Her delicate fingers twisted the hem of her dress subtly, her eyes studying Evelyn's reaction with calculated nonchalance.

Memories flooded back like a relentless tide.

That winter, Margaret had indeed taken in the homeless Evelyn. But when the Hill family relocated, they abandoned her at the orphanage gates without a second thought.

"Of course not," Evelyn pressed her lips together. "I owe you for your kindness back then."

Margaret's face instantly brightened as she looped her arm through Evelyn's. "Then you must join me for dinner! My treat!"

Evelyn instinctively tensed to pull away but paused when she met Margaret's expectant gaze.

"Alright."

Margaret chattered nonstop like a cheerful songbird as they walked.

"You always hated being touched as a child. Some things never change," she teased lightly.

Evelyn remained silent beside her, her fingers absently tracing the strap of her designer bag.

The moment the private dining room door swung open, Evelyn froze mid-step.

Harrison Whitmore and his wife sat at the round table, their hushed conversation halting as they looked up in unison.

"Mom, Dad, guess who I ran into?" Margaret tugged Evelyn forward eagerly. "It's Evelyn!"

Harrison's eyes lit up as he rose. "Well, if it isn't our dear Evelyn!"

His gaze swept over her, lingering on her flawless makeup and luxury handbag.

"Where did you find her?" Lydia chimed in, her smile saccharine.

Margaret pouted playfully. "I'm a teaching assistant at Harvard now. I bumped into Evelyn right after class. She's a famous designer these days!"

Evelyn's fingers tightened imperceptibly.

"Evelyn," Harrison began, rubbing his hands together. "About what happened back then—"

"Dad!" Margaret cut him off sharply. "Let's not ruin this happy reunion."

She guided Evelyn to a seat, pouring her a glass of lemon water with exaggerated hospitality. "Try this—it's wonderfully refreshing."

Evelyn stared at the crystal-clear liquid, noting from her periphery as Margaret took a sip before accepting the glass.

"A toast to our reunion!" Margaret raised her glass, her smile dazzling.

Evelyn drained hers in one swift motion.

As she set the glass down, she caught the fleeting glance exchanged between Harrison and Lydia.

Their eyes held a glint of something unspoken—something calculating.
###Chapter 115

"Evelyn, try this."

Margaret beamed as she eagerly piled food onto Evelyn's plate.

Harrison and Lydia chimed in, their voices syrupy with false concern.

Evelyn took a sip of lemon water, discreetly spitting it into her napkin under the guise of dabbing her lips.

A sudden throbbing pulsed at her temples.

Her vision blurred. Her limbs turned leaden.

"Evelyn?"

Margaret's voice echoed as if underwater.

She dug her nails into her palms, fighting the creeping paralysis.

The drug worked faster than expected.

"It's working!" Lydia clapped her hands, beady eyes gleaming. "The little bitch is finally out."

Harrison rubbed his hands together, yellowed teeth bared. "Imported goods never disappoint. Hurry—the car's waiting out back."

"That face alone is worth six figures." Margaret licked her lips. "Sophia was right. We should sell her to the mountains."

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

Sophia Lowell.

So it was her.

She let Lydia haul her up, reeking of cheap liquor.

"Make it convincing." Harrison splashed vodka down her collar. "Say she got wasted."

The backdoor wind slapped her face.

A black sedan crouched like a panther in the shadows.

They shoved her into the backseat. Her phone glowed silently in her pocket.

"Stupid girl, thinking we'd help her." Lydia spat. "If not for Sophia's money, who'd bother with this trash?"

Margaret cackled. "Once we get paid, we're buying a penthouse downtown!"

Evelyn kept her eyes shut, nails biting into her palms.

The drug was wearing off.

Sensation prickled back into her limbs.

As the car jolted over potholes, she stealthily sent her GPS coordinates.

"Heard they like tender meat like hers." Harrison whispered. "Cut out her tongue—see how she runs then."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Now she understood Sophia's plan.

Not mere revenge.

A fate worse than death.

The scenery outside grew desolate.

She counted heartbeats, biding her time.

Tonight, these leeches would learn their lesson.

Permanently.

###Chapter 116

This show was doomed to fail from the start.

——

Inside the CEO's office of Sullivan Group, Ethan Sullivan's knuckles turned white as he gripped his phone, fury burning in his eyes.

He snatched his suit jacket and stormed out, sending a voice message to his inner circle: "Evelyn's been kidnapped!"

A location pin followed immediately.

The black Maybach shot out of the underground garage like an arrow, trailed by three security vehicles.

At the same time, the police line connected.

The recording clearly captured the Hill family's scheming—each word deepened the crimson rage in Ethan's gaze.

The convoy sped away from downtown, racing toward an abandoned factory on the outskirts.

"Stop pretending to be pure!" Margaret Hill kicked Evelyn Laurent's unconscious form. "Aunt's family is useless. They couldn't even handle trash like this."

Harrison Whitmore took a drag from his cigarette and sneered. "That's why it's up to us. My brother-in-law's leg is broken, my nephew's still bedridden—this revenge is non-negotiable."

He turned to the driver with a sycophantic grin. "Mr. Sun, before handing her over to the boss, maybe we could..."

The driver remained impassive. "Rules are rules."

Harrison shut his mouth but couldn't tear his gaze away from Evelyn.

Such a delicate girl. What a waste not to touch her.

On the backseat, Evelyn's lashes fluttered imperceptibly.

She heard every vile word these scum uttered.

The drug's effects were fading. Sensation slowly returned to her limbs.

She'd see just how long this farce could last.

Who they'd called didn't matter.

What mattered was—her brothers would come.

On the highway, Ethan's car pushed past its limits.

The three Langley brothers closed in from different directions.

Victoria Langley's grip on the steering wheel turned her knuckles white. "Touch my daughter, and I'll make them regret being born."

Screeching brakes echoed outside the abandoned factory.

"She's dead weight!" Nina Rutherford panted, dragging Evelyn. "Margaret, help me!"

Margaret yanked Evelyn's other arm. "Keep your voice down, Mom. Let the boss inspect the goods already!"
###Chapter 117

Margaret Hill and Sophia Lowell dragged Evelyn Laurent toward the abandoned factory, each gripping one of her arms.

Evelyn let her body go limp, deliberately making them bear her full weight.

She cracked her eyelids open just enough to scan their surroundings.

Peeling paint. Rusted machinery. This place had clearly been deserted for years.

Harrison Whitmore and the driver led the way ahead.

From deep inside the factory, muffled male voices drifted through the air.

"Why is this bitch so heavy?" Margaret panted, stopping to catch her breath.

Sophia wheezed beside her. "Let's rest for a minute."

The moment their grips loosened, Evelyn struck.

Her fists flashed out like lightning, striking both women's temples with precision.

Margaret and Sophia collapsed without a sound.

Evelyn gently lowered them to the ground before spinning on her heel.

She had already spotted the unlocked car.

The keys glinted on the driver's seat, beckoning in the sunlight.

Evelyn lunged into the vehicle. Ignition. Gearshift. One fluid motion.

The engine roared to life as the car shot forward like an arrow.

"What the—?" Harrison whirled around at the noise.

His wife and daughter lay unconscious on the ground. Evelyn was already speeding away.

"After her!" the driver bellowed.

Five or six burly men burst from the factory, piling into a van in hot pursuit.

Evelyn's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel.

This was her first time actually driving.

Yet her movements remained calm and precise, every action measured.

In the rearview mirror, two vans closed in rapidly.

"You're not getting away, bitch!" Harrison leaned out his window, face contorted with rage.

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile.

She jerked the wheel hard. Tires screeched as the car executed a perfect drift onto the main road.

Harrison slapped his thigh in frustration. "Faster! That's two million dollars right there!"

The thought of Sophia's promised bonus—another million—made his eyes burn with greed.

Evelyn floored the accelerator. The needle on the speedometer climbed steadily.

She had to lose them.

A sharp curve loomed ahead. Evelyn's eyes gleamed.

This was her chance.

###Chapter 118

Ethan Sullivan's crimson eyes burned into the fleeing sedan ahead. Two million dollars—slipping right through his fingers.

He stomped his foot in frustration, itching to chase down Evelyn Laurent and drag her back.

Evelyn's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel. Two vans pursued relentlessly in her rearview mirror. She inhaled sharply, forcing calm into her veins.

She didn't know the men from the factory. Fighting them head-on would be suicide. Escape was her only option.

Whoever answered her call would come. Fast.

The speedometer needle climbed.

A black streak of lightning appeared in the opposite lane. The familiar Maybach roared toward her, its engine deafening.

"Ethan!"

Evelyn rolled down her window, screaming into the wind. Her voice shattered but carried.

Ethan's gaze sharpened, instantly assessing the situation. He spun the wheel without hesitation. "Jump!"

As the cars passed, Evelyn launched herself from the sedan. She stumbled toward the Maybach, collapsing into the passenger seat.

"Hospital." She gasped, her forehead glistening.

Ethan glanced at her pallid face and floored the accelerator. His men had already surrounded the vans in the rearview.

"Stay with me." His voice was steel.

Evelyn nodded weakly, her vision darkening. The adrenaline faded, and the drugs reclaimed her.

Inside the van, Ethan pounded the seat. "We lost the prize!"

The driver trembled, his grip shaky on the wheel. He stared at the Maybach's license plate and suddenly swerved.

"Turn around! Now!" He barked into the radio.

Ethan scowled. "Are you insane? We're walking away from the money?"

"To hell with the money!" The driver spat. "Do you know whose car that is? The Sullivans!"

"The... Sullivans?" Ethan stammered. "No way. That girl's just some country—"

"Shut up!" The driver slammed the gas, the van screeching into retreat. "You just got us all killed!"

Ethan slumped in his seat. His two-million-dollar fantasy evaporated. Worse—he realized with dawning horror that he'd crossed the wrong people.

###Chapter 119

Clayton Heron kept spewing profanities in the car, his face twisted like a rabid dog. He lunged for the steering wheel.

"Get out!" the driver roared.

The two henchmen in the backseat sprang into action. One yanked the car door open while the other delivered a vicious kick.

"Ah—"

Clayton Heron tumbled onto the road, rolling several times before coming to a stop. Blood gushed from his forehead, staining half his face crimson.

A van nearly ran him over. His agonized moans blocked Ethan Sullivan's pursuing vehicles by sheer accident.

Two black-clad bodyguards dragged Clayton Heron to the roadside like a dead dog. The convoy sped past without slowing.

Inside Ethan's car, Evelyn Laurent slumped against the passenger seat, her face ghostly pale. Cold sweat drenched her back as nausea wracked her body.

"Hold on a little longer," Ethan rasped, his knuckles white on the steering wheel.

He floored the accelerator while dialing emergency services. His bloodshot eyes reflected in the rearview mirror like a raging beast.

Five minutes later, the Langley family convoy appeared ahead. Ethan rolled down his window and shouted, "Is Nathaniel here?"

Screeching brakes filled the air as the Langley brothers jumped out. Victoria Langley stumbled forward, her makeup streaked with tears.

Nathaniel Langley led the charge. His pupils contracted at the sight of Evelyn.

He still wore his lab coat from the research institute, having rushed over without changing.

"The ambulance is coming," Ethan said tightly. "Check her first."

Nathaniel carefully lifted Evelyn into the backseat. Victoria trembled violently as she took the passenger side.

The convoy turned around, sirens piercing the night.

Nathaniel's face darkened after a quick examination. "It's a new neural paralytic. Enough to take down an elephant."

Ethan swerved past slower vehicles, the speedometer needle kissing the redline.

They intercepted an ambulance halfway. Medical personnel took over immediately. Nathaniel jumped in and began intubation as heart monitors screamed warnings.

By the time they reached the hospital, the operating room lights already glowed.

Victoria clutched Ethan's sleeve, her nails digging into his flesh. "Who did this to my daughter?"

Ethan stared at the OR doors, his voice glacial. "Her so-called 'beloved relatives.'" He spat the last three words with murderous intent.
###Chapter 120

Ethan Sullivan summarized the incident in a few terse sentences.

Victoria Langley's teacup shattered on the floor, porcelain shards scattering. "How dare they!" Flames of fury burned in her eyes. "Where are the bastards who touched my daughter?"

"They're being pursued." Ethan's voice was glacial.

A phone rang abruptly.

Harrison Whitmore's voice came through the receiver. "Mr. Sullivan, we've captured them all. Benjamin Hill jumped from the car and broke his leg. He's at the hospital now. His wife and daughter are also in our custody."

"They planned to sell Miss Evelyn to thugs in the suburbs."

Muffled screams echoed through the line.

After Ethan took Evelyn Laurent away, Harrison had continued the chase, apprehending the fleeing culprits in their panic.

Inside an abandoned warehouse, a thug with a brutish face was pinned to the ground. He trembled violently. "Spare me, Mr. Sullivan! I didn't know she was yours! I never laid a finger on her!"

Regret twisted his gut.

He'd just taken a job—a premium deal with a stunning girl in the photos. The payment was settled, the delivery awaited. Then he'd kicked a steel plate.

"Shut him up."

A bodyguard's fist smashed into his face. Blood instantly seeped from his lips.

Listening to the report, Ethan's eyes frosted over. "Lock them up. If Evelyn..."

He didn't finish. Harrison understood.

Screams soon filled the warehouse.

The Hill family suffered the worst.

Margaret Hill and Sophia were bound, mouths gagged with filthy rags, trembling in a dark storage room. They only remembered being knocked out by Evelyn before waking in this hellhole.

Sophia writhed desperately.

The metal door swung open.

Harrison stood silhouetted in the doorway, his voice icy. "Bring them out."

Two black-clad bodyguards dragged the mother and daughter like carcasses into the open, yanking the gag from Sophia's mouth.

"Do you know who I am?" Sophia's voice shook. "Kidnapping is a felony!"
###Chapter 121

Margaret Hill and her daughter found themselves surrounded by bodyguards, with no possible escape route.

"Talk!" Harrison Whitmore barked, his gaze sharp as a blade.

Margaret trembled violently, her face streaked with tears and snot. Before she could attempt an excuse, a bodyguard's palm struck her cheek with brutal force.

Slap!

The crisp sound of the slap echoed through the hallway.

"I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!" Margaret sobbed, clutching her stinging face. "It was Sophia Lowell! She paid us—"

Harrison smirked coldly and pulled out his phone, dialing Ethan Sullivan's number.

"Send them to the police station," came Ethan's icy voice on the other end.

Meanwhile, outside the hospital operating room, the five Langley brothers and Ethan stood in tense silence, the air thick with dread.

When Nathaniel Langley pushed open the OR doors, all eyes locked onto him.

"How is she?" Victoria Langley rushed forward, her voice trembling.

"The dosage wasn't lethal. We've pumped her stomach," Nathaniel said, removing his surgical mask, his eyes darkening. "It was a new type of sedative."

Ethan's fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white.

Inside the VIP ward, Evelyn Laurent lay motionless, her face as pale as parchment.

Victoria gently stroked her daughter's cheek, tears streaming uncontrollably.

"Sophia Lowell again!" she hissed through gritted teeth.

Ethan stood rigid by the doorway, his gaze fixed on Evelyn. He pulled out his phone and fired off several rapid messages.

"We've traced it," Nathaniel murmured. "It's linked to the traitor from the research institute."

Ethan's expression turned glacial, the air around him dropping several degrees.

At the far end of the hallway, nurses quickly diverted their path, unnerved by the terrifying aura radiating from him.

Outside the hospital, the Langley motorcade caused a stir among passersby, though no one dared approach for answers.

Inside the ward, the steady beep of the heart monitor filled the silence.

Evelyn's eyelashes fluttered faintly—she was waking.

Ethan moved toward her instinctively but halted three steps from the bed.

He drew a sharp breath and turned toward the window instead.

Beyond the glass, storm clouds gathered, heralding the tempest to come.
###Chapter 122

Victoria Langley remembered the Lowell mother-daughter pair vividly.

That night at The Grand Hyatt, Sophia Lowell had put on such a pitiful act. The memory still made Victoria nauseous.

This white lotus appeared pure on the surface but was more venomous than a scorpion.

How dare she target Evelyn?

Did she really think Evelyn Laurent was easy prey?

"Aunt Victoria."

Ethan Sullivan noticed her darkening expression. "Evelyn said she wants to handle the Lowells herself," he reminded her quietly.

"Though Vincent Lowell already got beaten up. He's still hospitalized."

Victoria gave an approving nod.

She longed to crush the Lowells.

But her daughter wanted revenge on her own terms. As a mother, she had to restrain herself.

Still, teaching Sophia a lesson wouldn't hurt, would it?

A dangerous glint flashed in Ethan's eyes.

He wanted nothing more than to throw Sophia behind bars.

But the woman was too cunning.

Her instructions to Isabella Valentine had all been verbal. Not a shred of evidence remained.

If the law couldn't touch her, other methods would.

That afternoon, Sophia had just entered the hospital when masked men cornered her.

Fists and kicks rained down.

Margaret Hill tried shielding her daughter—only to get beaten alongside her.

Sophia shrieked in pain. Her carefully maintained face swelled like a pig's head.

"Mom! What's happening?" Sophia gasped between sobs. "Dad must've pissed off the wrong people again!"

Margaret collapsed on the floor, trembling. "Impossible..."

In the capital, they'd been cautious. Who would they dare offend?

Unless...

Both women thought of Evelyn—then immediately dismissed the idea.

A country girl couldn't possibly have such power.

Just then, Sophia's phone rang.

Seeing the caller ID, her eyes lit up.

"Sophia Lowell! I hope you rot in hell!"

Isabella's hysterical scream exploded through the speaker.

"You destroyed my family! I'll haunt you from the grave!"

Sophia's hand jerked. The phone clattered to the floor.

Margaret stared at her daughter in horror. "Who... who was that?"
###Chapter 123

Margaret Hill's phone rang incessantly like a death knell. Sophia Lowell coldly rejected each call before finally blocking the number.

Just as Margaret opened her mouth to speak, her phone blared to life again.

She answered absentmindedly. A hysterical shriek exploded from the receiver: "Margaret Hill! Look what your precious daughter has done!"

It was Liu Qin.

The voice was so shrill it nearly pierced her eardrums.

A torrent of vulgar curses followed.

Suddenly, a man's furious roar and Liu Qin's bloodcurdling scream cut through the line.

The call ended abruptly.

Margaret clutched her phone, bewildered. "What...?"

Sophia's eyes flashed with irritation before transforming into tearful distress. "Mom...it was all Cousin's idea. She wanted to kidnap Evelyn Laurent for ransom..."

Her voice trembled with sobs. "Now they're blaming me for their failure..."

Margaret immediately pulled her daughter into a protective embrace. "Useless fools! They dare shift blame for their own incompetence?"

She swallowed Sophia's lies without question, cursing the entire He family instead.

Sophia exhaled inwardly.

This gullible woman was so easy to manipulate.

Her eyes narrowed. The Hes were truly worthless—they couldn't even handle one Evelyn Laurent.

That beating she'd endured was undoubtedly connected to Evelyn too.

She needed to secure Ethan Sullivan's affection—fast.

"Mom, I need money..." She lowered her voice, outlining her scheme.

Margaret's eyes lit up.

If her daughter could latch onto the Sullivan family...

Without hesitation, she handed Sophia Vincent Lowell's black card.

After hastily tending to her injuries, Sophia left despite the pain.

She had to uncover Vincent Sullivan's preferences immediately.

This was the key to getting closer to Ethan!

——

Hospital room.

Evelyn Laurent's eyelids fluttered open.

"She's awake!" The entire family rushed to her bedside.

"Does it still hurt?"

"How do you feel?"

She blinked, consciousness gradually clearing. "I'm fine..."

That drug had been terrifyingly potent. Just a whiff had knocked her out for hours.

Ethan Sullivan stood apart from the crowd, watching her with complex emotions.

He wanted to approach but restrained himself.

Victoria Langley clasped her daughter's hand, eyes red-rimmed. "Thank goodness Ethan found you in time..."

Evelyn froze.

Her gaze traveled past the others, locking with Ethan's.
###Chapter 124

Ethan Sullivan leaned against the sterile white hospital wall, arms crossed over his chest. Noticing Evelyn Laurent's gaze, his lips curved slightly as he gave her a subtle nod.

Evelyn's throat tightened. "Thank you," she rasped.

Her fingers had accidentally dialed Ethan's number during the crisis. His contact remained in her phone, yet she never expected him to be her rescuer in that dire moment.

Without him, tonight's outcome would have been unthinkable.

Ice flashed in Evelyn's eyes as she recalled Margaret Hill's betrayal. She'd gone to meet them out of gratitude for childhood kindness, only to discover they'd planned to sell her like merchandise.

Her trust had been gravely misplaced.

Only after confirming Margaret's legal punishment did Evelyn relax. With her robust constitution, she quickly discharged herself and returned to the Lowell estate with Victoria Langley.

Ethan didn't follow.

He'd recognized the pure gratitude in Evelyn's eyes—nothing more. The realization inexplicably irritated him, prompting his abrupt departure to investigate the drug's origin.

This matter would be thoroughly uncovered.

The next day, Evelyn took a rare leave of absence.

Meanwhile, whispers spread through Harvard University's campus forums like wildfire.

"Did you see the Lowell motorcade yesterday? They ran every red light to the hospital—must've been the seventh daughter in trouble."

"I spotted the Sullivan vehicles too! Who is this seventh daughter anyway? Rumor says she studies here."

"Imagine having that kind of powerful backing..."

The gossip remained contained, but Sophia Lowell's eyes gleamed with calculation as she scrolled through her phone during her own medical leave.

The seventh daughter of the Lowells—the same mysterious figure who'd denied her entry to The Grand Hyatt.

If no one knew the seventh daughter's true identity...

A predatory smile curled Sophia's lips as she strode back to her dorm.

Her roommates' excited whispers greeted her:

"Who do you think the seventh daughter is?"

"With yesterday's commotion, she must've been hospitalized. Sophia's at the hospital too today—could it be...?"

Three pairs of eyes widened in sudden realization.

The door creaked open.

Sophia stood framed in the doorway, surgical mask in place. "Lydia," she inquired with perfect innocence, "what are you all discussing?"
###Chapter 125

Sophia Lowell stood outside the dormitory door, her fingertips trembling slightly. Every word of the conversation inside reached her ears with perfect clarity.

"I heard the seventh daughter of the Lowell family recently returned from abroad..."

"That's a real heiress we're talking about..."

She took a deep breath and deliberately made her footsteps audible before pushing the door open.

"What are you all discussing?" She feigned nonchalance.

Her roommates exchanged glances. "We were just talking about that mysterious seventh daughter of the Lowell family."

Sophia's hand jerked involuntarily as she hurriedly shut the door. "D-don't talk about that outside..."

Her odd behavior made her roommates stare at each other in confusion.

"Sophia...don't tell me you're—" The short-haired roommate suddenly covered her mouth.

Sophia bit her lower lip, her eyes darting nervously. "Now that you know..."

The dorm fell into a deathly silence.

The three girls' eyes widened as everything clicked into place—the designer handbags, limited-edition perfumes, endless skincare products...

"Oh my god!" The round-faced roommate grabbed Sophia's hands excitedly. "You're actually—"

"Shh!"

Sophia pressed a finger to her lips with a mysterious smile. "This stays between us."

Their attitudes transformed instantly. One offered her fruit while another started organizing her desk.

Sophia basked in their sudden adoration, inwardly delighted. Since the real seventh daughter was practically a ghost who never showed her face, why not borrow the identity while she could?

As she applied lipstick before the mirror, a smug curve lifted the corners of her mouth. Once she secured Ethan Sullivan, who would care about being some Lowell heiress?

Right now, the priority was Old Mr. Sullivan's birthday banquet.

On the day of the celebration, Sophia dressed meticulously. The white sundress accentuated her innocent charm, and the gift box in her hands was wrapped with flawless precision.

At the entrance of The Grand Hyatt, security stopped her.

"Private event today."

Sophia lifted her chin. "I'm here for Old Mr. Sullivan's birthday celebration."

"Invitation, please."

Her smile froze. Her fingers unconsciously tightened around the gift box's silk ribbon.

The guard noticed. His expression hardened. "No invitation, no entry."

A cold sweat broke across Sophia's back. She hadn't anticipated the elite's security being this stringent—she couldn't even get through the door.

The growl of an engine approached. A black Maybach glided forward, its rear window partially lowered to reveal a glimpse of an exquisite profile.

The guards immediately straightened. Sophia's pulse quickened—her opportunity had arrived.
###Chapter 126

Sophia Lowell's knuckles turned white as she clenched her phone.

"I'm Professor Klein's student," she forced a smile, showing the security guard her contacts list. "See? His private number is right here."

The guard gave it a disinterested glance. "No invitation, no entry."

She took two steps back, the gift box digging painfully into her chest.

"Filthy gatekeeper," she muttered under her breath, venom flashing in her eyes as they landed on the gold buttons of his uniform. "Just wait until I become Mrs. Sullivan..."

The roar of an engine cut through the air.

A black Maybach glided into view. Sophia's pupils constricted.

The door opened. Evelyn Laurent stepped out gracefully in stiletto heels. Ethan Sullivan circled the car to offer her his arm.

"Good evening, Mr. Sullivan! Miss Laurent!"

The guards bowed in unison, their voices gratingly loud.

Sophia's nails bit into her palms. Her gaze locked onto the diamonds swaying from Evelyn's ears—the legendary "Stellar Tears" heirloom she'd only seen in auction catalogs.

Inside The Grand Hyatt, crystal chandeliers blazed.

"Evelyn, my dear!" Vincent Sullivan excused himself from guests to greet her. "Has this rascal been treating you well?"

Evelyn offered a demure smile. "Happy birthday, Uncle Vincent."

Her moon-white cheongsam shimmered under the lights, the Sullivan emerald brooch pinned at her collar. She looked like a porcelain goddess.

By the time the Lowell family arrived, the ballroom was alive with clinking glasses.

"Go mingle with the young crowd," Vincent patted her shoulder, then lowered his voice. "The Valentine girl is here. Don't engage."

In the lounge area, Isabella Valentine toyed with her diamond-studded manicure. She deliberately slammed her champagne flute down as Evelyn approached.

The glass clatter revealed another figure in the shadows.

Bianca Fairchild sat curled in a peacock-blue velvet chair like a sparrow trapped in a gilded cage. A half-eaten cake slumped on the table before her.

"That's the Quincy heiress," a waiter whispered. "They say she has depression. Best not to—"

Evelyn's gaze shifted—and collided with two burning stares.

Xander Quincy dragged Oliver Valentine through the crowd, his suit button popping off. "Dude, look! Since when is she some country bumpkin? She's—"

His voice died.

Evelyn lifted her lashes, casting delicate shadows across her cheeks. Her swan-like neck curved gracefully, a crimson birthmark peeking above her collarbone.

Oliver's glass tilted. Red wine splashed across his tailored trousers.
###Chapter 127

"Xander Quincy, you'd better stay away from Evelyn Laurent." Oliver Valentine blocked Xander with a cold expression, his gaze sharp. "She's Ethan Sullivan's fiancée."

Xander raised an eyebrow, studying Evelyn as she sipped her drink alone.

"What? You're smitten too?" He nudged Oliver playfully. "Last I heard, you were planning to pursue her."

Oliver scoffed. "That was a joke. Besides—" His eyes swept over Xander. "You're too old."

"What?!" Xander bristled, pointing at his handsome face. "Women swoon over me everywhere I go. How dare you call me old?"

He launched into a tirade, but Oliver ignored him and strode toward Evelyn.

"Miss Laurent." Oliver gave a slight nod.

Evelyn glanced up, her fingers tapping the glass with a crisp sound.

"Ethan didn't come?" Oliver scanned the room.

"No idea." Her tone was indifferent, as if discussing a stranger.

Xander sidled up, grinning. "You don't even know where your fiancé is?"

Evelyn's eyes turned icy. "Should I put a GPS tracker on him?"

Xander choked on his words and retreated, though his gaze flickered toward Bianca Fairchild in the corner.

The air grew heavy with tension.

"This is the third son of the Quincy family," Oliver offered, trying to lighten the mood. "He and Ethan grew up together."

Evelyn didn’t even lift her eyelids.

Oliver tactfully pulled Xander away. Evelyn picked up her glass again, her gaze drifting lazily across the ballroom.

Suddenly, a sickly sweet voice pierced through the chatter.

"Uncle Sullivan!" Sophia Lowell curtsied dramatically in her white dress, her hands trembling as she held up a gift box. "I’m Ethan’s student. I came to wish you a happy birthday!"

Vincent Sullivan narrowed his eyes, the air around him turning frigid. Sophia froze under his stare, a cold sweat breaking out on her back.

The ballroom fell silent.
###Chapter 128

Vincent Sullivan's icy gaze swept over Sophia Lowell like a blade.

"Must you shout? Do you think I'm too old to hear?"

His voice simmered with suppressed anger.

Sophia trembled and hastily lowered her head. "Uncle Vincent, I would never imply such a thing."

Vincent's expression darkened. If not for his birthday banquet, he would have already ordered this insolent girl thrown out.

Seeing the tension ease slightly, Sophia quickly presented a wooden box like a prized offering. "I brought this gift especially for you."

The butler stepped forward to accept it. Inside lay a rolled-up antique painting.

"It's a Longevity Scroll I found at an antique market," Sophia said softly. "One hundred calligraphy styles for good fortune. May you enjoy endless health and happiness, Uncle Vincent."

Vincent gave it a cursory glance—then his pupils constricted sharply.

The butler exchanged a look with him, his face instantly hardening.

"We'll accept the gift," the butler said coldly. "Miss Lowell, you may leave now."

Sophia froze. "But I came to celebrate Uncle Vincent's birthday—"

"I personally issued every invitation." The butler's lips curled in derision. "I don't recall sending one to you."

Sophia paled. "I'm Professor Ethan Sullivan's student—"

"Regardless of who you are," the butler cut in sharply, "no invitation means no entry. We're quite familiar with social climbers like you sneaking into events."

His tone turned dangerous. "But presenting a counterfeit painting as a birthday gift? What exactly are you playing at?"

Every guest's eyes locked onto Sophia.

Her blood turned to ice.

This was the most exclusive banquet in the city, attended only by elite family heads. She'd schemed relentlessly to get in—only to fail spectacularly at the critical moment.

"That's impossible!" Her voice shook. "I paid a fortune for it—"

The butler raised a hand. "Compose yourself. If you continue making a scene, I'll have security escort you out."

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

Just as humiliation threatened to crush her, a gentle male voice intervened. "Uncle, perhaps this is a misunderstanding."

A slender man in a gray suit approached. Pale and coughing lightly, he nevertheless stood firmly beside Sophia.

"I brought her as my guest," he said calmly. "The girl knows nothing about antiques—buying a fake is an honest mistake. Must we publicly shame her?"
###Chapter 129

Sophia Lowell's eyes welled up as she stared at the man shielding her.

"I truly know nothing about calligraphy..." Her voice trembled with unshed tears.

The three-million-dollar longevity scroll turned out to be a fake.

Each penny felt like a knife twisting in her heart.

Though it was Vincent Lowell's credit card, that money would have been her future inheritance.

Her attempt to impress Vincent Sullivan had backfired spectacularly.

At least Sebastian Royston intervened.

"Since she's Sebastian's guest, let it slide." Vincent Sullivan's icy gaze swept over them like a blade.

Sebastian cleared his throat and presented an exquisite gift box. "Uncle, my humble offering."

The butler received it with deference, presenting it to Vincent.

The older man's expression softened slightly as he dismissed them with a wave. "Go enjoy yourselves."

Sebastian bowed gracefully, flashing Sophia a faint smile over his shoulder. "Come."

Flustered by his attention, she trailed after him, missing the glacial glint in his eyes.

"Thank you, Mr. Royston." Her voice dripped saccharine sweetness.

Her gaze clung to his pallid features.

He bore a passing resemblance to Ethan Sullivan, but illness lent him a fragile, almost ethereal quality.

"Which family do you belong to?" Sebastian inquired casually.

Sophia flushed crimson. "I'm...just Professor Sullivan's student."

His attention snagged on the necklace at her throat.

Ethan's most treasured possession.

The very piece that vanished after the kidnapping, rumored to have been gifted to his savior.

Frost crystallized in his gaze.

So it was her.

"Your poise suggests aristocratic breeding." His smile remained gentle.

Sophia preened at the compliment. "You flatter me, Mr. Royston."

Her mind raced through his dossier.

The eldest son of Sullivan's second branch—brilliant but plagued by poor health.

When Vincent seized the family throne, his three nephews had battled ruthlessly.

Ethan emerged victorious, but Sebastian remained a formidable player.

After all, blood always tells.
###Chapter 130

Sophia's heart skipped a beat when Sebastian Royston approached her with champagne.

He knew how to charm women far better than Ethan Sullivan ever could.

"Miss Lowell, you have such exquisite grace." Sebastian swirled his glass, letting his gaze linger on her. "I mistook you for a debutante from some distinguished family."

Her cheeks burned.

She missed the icy detachment in his eyes.

Evelyn Laurent turned away after one glance.

Disgusting.

"Who upset you?" Ethan noticed Evelyn's darkened expression upon his return.

"Nothing." Her tone was glacial.

Ethan wisely didn't press further, silently taking a seat beside her.

Evelyn shifted away.

He didn't dare close the distance again.

"Ethan." Sebastian arrived with Sophia in tow.

"Professor Sullivan!" Sophia chirped sweetly.

Ethan's eyes frosted over. "What are you doing here?"

His revulsion was undisguised.

Sophia paled.

"I found her being turned away at the door." Sebastian chuckled. "She claimed to be your student."

"I have hundreds of students." Ethan's eyes narrowed. "Shall we invite them all in, Sebastian?"

"It's Father's birthday."

"Not some charity event for strays."

His smile remained pleasant, but the words cut deep.

"Professor—" Sophia's eyes welled up.

"Silence." Evelyn's sudden command sliced through the air.

Sophia flinched and hid behind Sebastian.

Only then did Sebastian properly notice Evelyn.

His brow arched. "So this is your type now?"

"I thought you swore to marry only the owner of that token."

"Ah yes, you're engaged to the seventh Miss Laurent."

Leaning closer, he dropped his voice to a venomous whisper: "Playing both sides now?"
###Chapter 131

"Miss!"

Housekeeper Zhou's face paled as he rushed to Evelyn's side. She was curled up on the bench, her slender fingers clutching her chest, her complexion ghostly white.

"Dr. Sullivan! Now!" Housekeeper Zhou barked.

Ethan's smug expression froze. He stumbled forward, fumbling for his stethoscope.

"Asthma attack..." His voice shook. "That kid was right."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Nurses scrambled for emergency equipment. But Evelyn's breathing grew more labored, her chest heaving violently, her lips tinged blue.

"Useless!" Housekeeper Zhou kicked Ethan aside. "Ambulance! Call an ambulance!"

"Too late!" someone shouted. "Find that young man from earlier!"

Ethan's face darkened. "What does he know—"

"Get out!" Housekeeper Zhou slapped him hard before bolting through the crowd.

Three hundred meters away, Lucian was studying a map when strong arms suddenly wrapped around his legs from behind.

"Please save my mistress!" Housekeeper Zhou knelt, forehead pressed to the pavement. "She's having an asthma attack!"

Lucian's pupils contracted. He shoved the man aside and sprinted back.

From a vantage point, a pair of sharp eyes glinted faintly.

"Clear the area! Keep it ventilated!"

Lucian returned, silver needles already between his fingers. Evelyn's face was now purple, her consciousness fading.

The needles fell like rain. The Three Talents Acupuncture technique gleamed coldly under the sun. Lucian pressed his palm to her chest, channeling energy into her.

"Cough—"

Evelyn arched violently, vomiting stomach contents. Lucian swiftly cleared her airway and removed the needles one by one.

As the last needle withdrew, her breathing finally steadied.

"She's stable for now." Lucian wiped his brow. "But she needs rest."

Housekeeper Zhou nodded frantically, his back drenched in sweat.

"I'm Evelyn Laurent." The girl weakly grasped Lucian's sleeve. "Tell me your name."

Her fingers were cold and soft, like willow leaves in early spring.

"Unnecessary." Lucian pulled away and walked off.

"Wait!" Evelyn tried to follow but collapsed from weakness.

Housekeeper Zhou caught her. "Don't worry, Miss. I'll find him."

Evelyn watched Lucian's retreating figure, a strange light flickering in her eyes. "Interesting..."

Lucian quickened his pace toward Blackthorn Lair. The setting sun stretched his shadow long behind him.

"Maintenance shutdown?"

He narrowed his eyes at the sealed entrance. Swiping his keycard, the lock clicked open—

"Beep—"

Every hair on his body stood erect. He dove to the ground.

"BOOM!"

The deafening explosion engulfed Blackthorn Lair in flames.
###Chapter 132

The sharp crack of a slap echoed through the hallway.

Sebastian Royston staggered back from the blow, his back slamming against the wall.

He pressed a trembling hand to his stinging left cheek, blood seeping between his fingers.

Evelyn Laurent shook out her numb palm with deliberate calm.

"With skin this thick, no wonder you dared to threaten me."

Her razor-sharp gaze sliced toward Sophia Lowell cowering behind Sebastian.

These two snakes coiled together always meant trouble.

But what infuriated her most was Sebastian's blatant threats.

Car accident? Fall from a building?

He was signing her death warrant.

A glacial glint flashed in Evelyn's eyes.

If someone was begging for death, she'd gladly deliver it early.

Ethan Sullivan chuckled low, the shadows lifting from his brow.

He watched Evelyn's display with keen interest.

The little wildcat's claws were sharper than he'd imagined.

Sebastian's face darkened, his lips twisting into a sneer.

"Do you know what happens to those who touch me? When Ethan tires of you—"

Crack!

Another slap silenced his threat.

Evelyn flexed her wrist, eyes dripping with disdain.

"Do you know what happens to those who touch me?"

Sebastian's cheek swelled instantly, blood trickling from his lip.

He glared at Evelyn with murderous intent.

Sophia trembled in the corner like a frightened mouse.

She never imagined Evelyn would dare strike the third son of the Sullivan family.

The little bitch had lost her mind!

Ethan stepped forward with a jade-smooth smile.

"Third Brother, your health is fragile. Don't collapse at Father's birthday banquet."

He offered a handkerchief with false concern. "How unlucky to drop dead here."

Sebastian's temple pulsed with rage, fists clenched white-knuckled.

He finally shoved the handkerchief away and stormed off.

Sophia hesitated, craving more drama, but fled when Evelyn's lethal stare promised another beating.
###Chapter 133

The doors of The Grand Hyatt burst open.

Sebastian Royston and Sophia Lowell stumbled out as if demons were at their heels.

"Mr. Royston, are you alright?" Sophia frantically steadied the swaying man.

Her gaze landed on his swollen cheeks. The two vivid handprints made her gasp.

"Who the hell was that madwoman?" Sebastian spat through clenched teeth.

Sophia quickly replied, "That was Evelyn Laurent. Just some vulgar country bumpkin with no manners."

Flames of fury ignited in Sebastian's eyes.

A nobody from the countryside dared to lay hands on him?

What infuriated him more was Ethan Sullivan shielding that little savage!

He'd arrived too early today—not only missing the Lowells and their seventh daughter, but getting publicly slapped twice.

"Evelyn Laurent..."

He ground out the name like he wanted to chew it to pieces.

His eyes suddenly caught on the necklace at Sophia's throat.

Ethan couldn't have missed it. Why had he been so indifferent?

Yet he'd been unusually attentive to that Evelyn girl.

Sebastian narrowed his eyes.

He needed to contact the Lowells immediately. They had to see Ethan's true colors.

"Mr. Royston, shall I take you to the hospital?" Sophia asked sweetly.

His face was now grotesquely swollen, mottled with bruises.

He forced a gentlemanly smile. "Yes."

Sophia's heart fluttered.

Despite the humiliating scene, Sebastian's status remained untouchable.

And he was being so gentle with her...

This golden goose—she'd cling to him with everything she had.

——

Inside The Grand Hyatt, Evelyn finally relaxed her icy expression as she watched the two flee.

"Thank you," Ethan said softly.

Evelyn arched a brow. "For what?"

"For teaching Sebastian a lesson."

"I just couldn't stand him." Evelyn stood. "He deserved it for targeting me."

Without another glance, she walked away.

Ethan rubbed his temples, watching her go.

How could he capture her attention?

He could feel the distance Evelyn kept between them.

If not for their agreement, she'd have left him far behind already.
###Chapter 134

Ethan Sullivan's gaze darkened.

He watched Evelyn Laurent walk alone to a corner, casually picking up a slice of cake before settling in an isolated spot.

His fingers tapped twice against his wine glass before he stood and headed toward Oliver Valentine.

Xander Quincy was downing drinks one after another.

Several empty liquor bottles littered the coffee table.

"Drinking alone?" Ethan took the seat opposite him, pouring himself a whiskey.

Oliver immediately straightened with alarm. "Not like last time."

Their previous drinking contest had left him suffering the consequences.

Xander didn't even glance up, continuing to refill his glass.

Yet his eyes kept drifting uncontrollably toward one direction.

In the corner, Bianca Fairchild sat as quietly as a shadow.

Several socialites gathered nearby, occasionally casting mocking glances her way.

Evelyn was equally solitary.

But no one dared approach her.

The memory of those two slaps remained vivid.

"Did you hear? Bianca's adopted."

"Shh, lower your voice. Rumor has it they took her in as Beatrice's luck shield."

The whispers reached Evelyn's ears.

Her grip tightened slightly on the fork.

A sudden commotion erupted at the ballroom entrance.

"Miss Beatrice has arrived!"

The crowd surged toward the doorway like a tidal wave.

Beatrice Quincy appeared in a dazzling red gown.

In the corner, Bianca's head bowed even lower.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes.

Now she understood why Bianca always endured humiliation silently.

Behind this glittering façade of wealth hid such an ugly truth.

Ethan swirled his drink, his gaze shifting between Evelyn and Bianca.

Xander suddenly slammed his glass onto the table.

"I need air."

He strode toward the terrace, his stiff back radiating irritation.

Oliver sighed. "What a miserable party."

Ethan remained silent.

His attention stayed fixed on Evelyn.

She was staring at Bianca with a deeply furrowed brow.

Amidst the clinking glasses and forced laughter, dangerous undercurrents swirled beneath the gilded surface.
###Chapter 135

The Grand Hyatt glittered with lights as glasses clinked in celebration. The younger generation had naturally divided into distinct social circles.

Oliver Valentine, Ethan Sullivan, and Xander Quincy occupied their own corner, an invisible barrier keeping others at bay.

Isabella Valentine held court at the center of another group, while Beatrice Quincy commanded her own flock of admirers.

Only Bianca Fairchild remained curled in the shadows, isolated.

Evelyn Laurent stood alone as well—though no one dared approach her.

She savored the solitude, leisurely indulging in an exquisite strawberry cake. The rich cream melted on her tongue, tempting her to take another slice.

Ethan's gaze cut through the crowd, discreetly tracking her every move.

Each delicate bite, each sip of wine—he memorized them all.

So absorbed was he that his own glass remained forgotten in his hand.

Clink.

Xander slammed his drink down, glaring. "If you like her, go after her. What kind of man just watches from the shadows?"

Ethan withdrew his attention. "You wouldn't understand."

"Wouldn't I?" Xander scoffed, loosening his tie with irritation. "Then enlighten me. What do you understand?"

Alcohol burned through him, fueling his frustration. "If you can't even confess, does it even count as love?"

Ethan's eyes darkened. "She doesn't care."

Evelyn had never needed his affection.

He knew exactly where he stood in her heart.

That girl who'd survived alone for over a decade had built walls no one could breach.

Victoria Langley and the others had barely managed to crack them open.

And him? He was just a passerby in her life.

The thought made Ethan throw back his drink in one sharp motion.

Xander faltered, momentarily speechless.

"Brother, why are you drinking so much?"

A sweet voice interrupted them.

Beatrice glided over in a violet mermaid gown, her skin luminous under the lights.

Xander's expression softened slightly at the sight of his sister. "Finished your shoot?"

"Came straight after wrapping." She smiled gracefully, every inch the Oscar-winning actress. "How could I miss Mr. Sullivan's birthday celebration?"

Xander nodded and reached for another glass.

"Brother." Beatrice caught his wrist. "Father will be furious if you keep this up."

His fingers stilled, conflict flashing in his eyes—but he ultimately set the glass down.

Beatrice glanced around casually. "Where's Bianca? Mother said she arrived."

At the name, Xander's face froze.
###Chapter 136

Beatrice Quincy scanned the room before spotting Bianca Fairchild in the corner.

Her lips curved into a radiant smile as she dragged Xander Quincy toward her.

"Bianca!"

The bright call made Bianca's head snap up.

Recognizing them, she scrambled to her feet, fingers nervously twisting her skirt.

"Sister... Brother..."

Her voice was barely audible before she lowered her lashes.

Beatrice linked arms with her affectionately. "Still so shy?"

Her nails dug imperceptibly into Bianca's inner arm.

"I... I'm not used to these events..."

Bianca paled but forced a smile.

Beatrice tapped her forehead playfully. "You must learn to be more poised."

Her sweet smile belied the unrelenting pressure of her grip.

Xander observed coldly without comment.

Evelyn Laurent swirled her juice glass, taking in the entire scene.

She took a sip before looking away.

"You must be the seventh Laurent daughter?"

Beatrice suddenly appeared before her, extending a manicured hand.

"Beatrice Quincy."

Evelyn gave her hand a perfunctory shake.

"May I call you Evie?"

Beatrice batted innocent lashes.

"Whatever."

Evelyn took half a step back to create distance.

"Didn't your brothers come?"

Beatrice pretended to glance around casually.

"No idea."

"But they're your brothers, aren't they?"

Beatrice feigned confusion.

"Should I leash them?"

Evelyn turned on her heel and sat beside Ethan Sullivan.

Amusement flickered in Ethan's eyes as he subtly leaned closer.

"Is the wine any good?"

Evelyn studied the cocktail glass on the coffee table.
###Chapter 137

Ethan Sullivan swirled the wine glass with his slender fingers, his deep gaze fixed on Evelyn Laurent. "This wine tastes terrible."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Terrible? You seemed to enjoy it earlier."

The corner of Ethan's lips curved slightly, his voice dropping to a husky murmur. "You were watching me?"

Her expression remained impassive. "I observed everyone in the room."

Ethan shook his head with an amused chuckle.

He should've known. This girl had no romantic interest in him whatsoever.

Beatrice Quincy, who'd been standing nearby, stiffened momentarily before plastering on a gracious smile.

"Evelyn, have I offended you somehow?" She blinked her doe eyes at Ethan. "Ethan, won't you help me out here?"

Ethan ignored her completely, his attention never wavering from Evelyn.

"We're not acquainted," Evelyn stated coldly.

Beatrice tucked a stray lock behind her ear. "That's why I'd like to be friends."

She'd always been confident in her charms. A child star turned Oscar-winning actress by twenty, beloved throughout the industry.

Too bad Evelyn wasn't buying it.

"Miss Quincy," Evelyn met her gaze directly, "I've made myself clear. Also, your Green Tea Bitch act is so strong it's giving me a headache."

Beatrice's fingers clenched abruptly.

She had spritzed on green tea perfume today, but the implication stung.

"My apologies for disturbing you." She forced a smile before turning away.

"Don't mind that country bumpkin," several socialites whispered as they gathered around Beatrice. "She's downright savage—throws punches without warning."

"We all steer clear of her."

Beatrice shook her head gently. "Don't say such things. She's just... refreshingly blunt."

The group took the hint and changed the subject.
###Chapter 138

Merrick Hale was never one to back down.

He wasn't being merciful—he simply wanted to regain control of the company before slowly dealing with Finn Carter and his crew.

His more sinister move was directing the conflict toward the Liu family.

This ensured the Voss Family wouldn't stand idly by.

The rise of the Liu family had always been a threat to the Voss Family, compounded by years of bitter rivalry.

His decision to approach Xander Voss was a calculated one.

Though the Voss Family looked down on someone like Merrick Hale, the enemy of their enemy was an ally.

That was why Xander Voss agreed to mediate.

But who knew Eira Sutton wouldn’t play along?

How dare a small firm like Blueprint Investments act so arrogantly?

Xander Voss’s expression darkened.

Eira Sutton was enjoying a rare moment of leisure.

She cradled her coffee cup, lazily leaning against the window.

Outside, people hurried past, each lost in their own world.

It reminded her of an old saying:

"All the hustle and bustle under heaven is for profit; all the coming and going is for gain."

She had fled an arranged marriage to this city, only to meet Finn Carter by chance.

The memory of his flustered reaction when he first saw her made her lips curve unconsciously.

Who would’ve thought he’d achieve so much in just half a year?

She glanced at her watch. Today, she wanted no responsibilities.

Just quiet observation of the streets, savoring this rare peace.

Later, she’d share lunch and an embrace with the one she loved.

Life was beautiful.

A sudden commotion erupted at the café entrance.

Xander Voss strode in, clad in a tailored suit, his wristwatch glinting under the sunlight.

His arrival drew awed whispers.

"It’s Young Master Voss!"

"So handsome!"

The waitresses blushed.

The Voss Family was one of Jiangzhou’s elite, with billions in assets.

As the heir, Xander Voss was an untouchable figure.

His fiancée was the daughter of a Zhonghai power broker.

Yet when he entered the café, his gaze froze.

The silhouette by the window stole his breath.

Eira Sutton tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, her profile breathtaking in the sunlight.

Xander Voss felt as if struck by lightning.

He’d met countless socialites, but none compared to this vision.

"Young Master Voss, that’s Eira Sutton, CEO of Blueprint Investments," his assistant whispered.

Xander Voss straightened his tie and approached.

Ahem.

Eira Sutton didn’t turn.

"Ms. Su, what a pleasant surprise," Xander Voss said, forcing composure.

Two bodyguards behind him watched intently, ready to act.

Eira Sutton gave him a cool glance. "And you are?"

"Xander Voss of Voss Enterprises." He extended a hand.

She ignored it. "So you’re the one who called the front desk?"

He withdrew his hand awkwardly. "About Merrick Hale… Have you reconsidered reconciliation?"

"If the Voss Family were majority shareholders, would you surrender control?" she countered.

"But he founded the company—"

"Is that what you learned abroad?" Eira Sutton smirked. "Survival of the fittest is business 101."

Xander Voss faltered. "Fine. The Voss Family will step back. But be warned—Merrick Hale plays dirty."

"Noted." She lifted her coffee cup.

"Perhaps I could take you to lunch?"

His assistant nearly choked.

What happened to mediation?

"Sorry. I have plans." Her tone was icy.

"Another time, then." He bowed gracefully and left.

Back in his car, he murmured, "I’m in love."

His assistant gaped. "You’re engaged!"

"I’ve never seen a woman so captivating," Xander Voss mused. "Tell Merrick Hale the Voss Family now supports Blueprint Investments."

The assistant stared.

Inside the café, Eira Sutton’s phone rang.

"Look outside," Finn Carter’s voice said.

She turned to see him leaning against a car, waving.

Her smile bloomed as she grabbed her purse and hurried down.

The moment she slid into the car, she threw herself into his arms, startling Magnus Carter into nearly hitting the wrong pedal.

"Hey! Some of us are single here!"

Eira Sutton straightened. "Let’s go home."

Finn Carter grinned.

"Boss, we’ve got tails," Magnus Carter warned.

"Change of plans—head to Vientiane International," Finn Carter ordered.

Eira Sutton glanced back. "What’s happening?"

"Don’t worry. They’ll regret following us." He squeezed her hand. "If they make a move, they won’t leave alive."
###Chapter 139

Ethan Sullivan's lips curved in an almost imperceptible smile before settling back into his usual gentle expression.

Only those closest to him would notice just how delighted he was at this moment.

Evelyn Laurent casually picked two bottles of fruit wine and returned to their seats beside Ethan.

Reluctantly, he released her hand, his fingertips still tingling with the warmth of her skin.

Ethan sighed inwardly. If he held on any longer, she might suspect something.

Then it would be harder to find another excuse to hold her hand again.

A thought crossed his mind—perhaps he should host more banquets.

Under the pretense of social events, he could create more opportunities for intimacy.

But then he remembered Evelyn's aversion to crowded gatherings. She wouldn't have come tonight if not for Vincent Sullivan's birthday celebration.

His gaze softened as he watched the girl beside him.

Evelyn took small sips of the fruit wine, her cheeks tinged with a faint blush. He had deliberately chosen a low-alcohol option, suitable for someone her age.

In two months, she would turn eighteen.

Ethan's eyes darkened as he contemplated what gift could possibly outshine those from her brothers.

That would be no easy feat.

Shaking his head, he pushed the thought aside and focused on enjoying the moment with her.

Not far away, Beatrice Quincy gripped her wineglass so tightly her knuckles turned white.

A polished smile remained on her face, but her eyes slithered toward Evelyn with venomous intensity.

"Uncle Sullivan, apologies for being late!"

Theodore Langley's booming voice suddenly rang out.

The doors of The Grand Hyatt swung open as the four Langley brothers escorted Victoria and Richard Langley inside.

Vincent Sullivan greeted them warmly.

While the adults exchanged pleasantries, the four young men fidgeted restlessly, their eyes darting around the room.

"Go on, find your sister," Vincent said with an amused wave.

Like prisoners granted amnesty, the brothers immediately made a beeline toward Evelyn.

"Evie!"

Evelyn, who had been sharing a drink with Ethan, looked up at the sound.

In the blink of an eye, she was surrounded by her four brothers, while Ethan found himself unceremoniously shoved aside.

Ethan's expression darkened instantly, his gaze turning resentful toward these unwelcome intruders.

"Theodore!" Theodore snatched the glass from his sister's hand. "Who said you could let Evie drink?"

Four pairs of accusatory eyes locked onto Ethan, as if he were some villain corrupting their precious treasure.
###Chapter 140 

Ethan Sullivan blinked innocently at Evelyn Laurent.

She shifted uncomfortably under his gaze and cleared her throat. "I insisted on drinking. He tried to stop me."

A low chuckle escaped Ethan, his eyes softening with warmth.

"I want some too!" Theodore Langley snatched the bottle and downed it in one gulp.

Normally under strict family supervision, he seized this chance to indulge thanks to his sister.

Julian Langley quietly retreated to a corner.

One drink was enough to knock him out.

Sebastian Langley sipped politely, maintaining his usual elegance.

As a lawyer, Dominic Langley had the highest alcohol tolerance among the brothers.

Theodore was the life of the party despite being a lightweight.

Evelyn had already polished off two bottles without batting an eye.

Ethan massaged his temples in frustration.

He'd hoped for alone time with Evelyn, but now found himself surrounded by four protective brothers.

His gaze drifted toward the doorway, wishing Victoria Langley would appear to rein in her sons.

No such luck.

Beatrice Quincy noticed Julian's isolation and immediately abandoned her friends.

"Mr. Langley." She flashed a dazzling smile, locking eyes with him. "Long time no see."

Julian stood stiffly and offered a perfunctory handshake. "Ms. Quincy."

Beatrice produced an autograph book from her purse. "Would you sign this? I'm your biggest fan."

She batted her lashes, feigning familiarity.

Julian frowned as he scribbled his signature and returned the book.

Undeterred, Beatrice pressed on. "I heard you're joining a family reality show? Which relative are you bringing?"

His expression turned icy. "That's none of your concern."

The production required confidentiality, yet she dared pry.

Beatrice stuck out her tongue playfully. "Don't misunderstand—I'm also invited. Just curious."

"Then you should respect the rules." Julian's tone was distant.

Unfazed, she grabbed a glass. "My apologies. I'll punish myself with a drink."

She tossed it back with practiced ease.

Evelyn slammed her bottle down, eyes blazing. "Beatrice Quincy, what's your game?"
###Chapter 141

Beatrice Quincy's smile froze on her face.

She hadn't expected Evelyn Laurent to confront her so abruptly.

"Julian can't handle alcohol." Evelyn's voice cut like an ice blade. "Yet you deliberately toasted him."

Her almond-shaped eyes brimmed with frost.

Beatrice's fingertips trembled slightly.

Of course she knew Julian Langley's drinking limits. Victoria Langley had mentioned the Oscar-winning actor got drunk after one glass and turned unruly.

That's precisely why she'd chosen this tactic.

"Evelyn, you misunderstand." Beatrice quickly adopted a wounded expression, her voice dripping with honeyed sweetness. "I was only punishing myself..."

Tears welled in her eyes.

Evelyn responded with a cold laugh.

The private room's atmosphere turned glacial.

The four Langley brothers maintained a silence. A flicker of approval crossed Julian's eyes - his little sister had grown up, now protecting her older brothers.

Ethan Sullivan's gaze burned into Evelyn.

Jealousy gnawed at him.

Why wasn't he the one being defended?

Xander Quincy frowned at the unfolding drama. For the first time, his sister's behavior struck him as excessive.

"I'm sorry..." Beatrice finally let her tears fall. "I shouldn't have been such an eyesore here."

She turned and fled.

Her stilettos left chaotic imprints on the plush carpet.

Evelyn leaned back into the sofa, taking a sip of red wine. Julian immediately nuzzled against her shoulder like an overgrown puppy.

"My Evelyn's the best!"

Her three other brothers watched longingly, their faces screaming "me too."

Ethan's grip tightened around his glass.

The crystal reflected his brooding profile.

In the restroom mirror, Beatrice viciously wiped away her tears. Her carefully drawn eyeliner had smudged into grotesque streaks resembling lacerations.

She pulled out her phone and dialed a number.

"Change of plans." Her voice turned terrifyingly cold. "I want Evelyn Laurent ruined beyond redemption."
###Chapter 142
Beatrice Quincy stood before the bathroom mirror, her gaze locked onto her reflection.

Her nails dug deep into her palms, knuckles turning white.

That bitch Evelyn Laurent!

A country bumpkin dared to humiliate her in public!

She was Beatrice Quincy, the Quincy family's heiress and a rising star in Hollywood. How could she lose to that vulgar woman?

Julian Langley actually rejected her for that trash!

The memory of Julian shielding Evelyn made Beatrice's chest heave violently.

She swept all the cosmetics off the counter with a violent motion.

The sound of shattering glass echoed sharply in the empty bathroom.

Then a stall door suddenly opened.

Bianca Fairchild hurried out with her head down, but froze when she saw Beatrice.

"Stop."

Beatrice's voice slithered out like a venomous snake.

She grabbed Bianca's wrist, nails sinking into flesh.

"Running away from me?"

Bianca gasped in pain but didn't dare struggle. "Miss Quincy, I wasn't—"

"Shut up!"

Beatrice slapped her across the face.

The sharp crack of the blow reverberated through the bathroom.

Bianca's cheek immediately swelled, a trickle of blood appearing at the corner of her mouth.

"Remember your place." Beatrice gripped her chin. "You're just a dog the Quincy family keeps."

She leaned closer, her voice icy. "I heard you've been quite popular on set lately?"

Bianca trembled. "I...I haven't—"

"Better not." Beatrice sneered. "Don't forget your grandmother's still lying in that hospital bed."

She suddenly yanked Bianca's hair. "Were you laughing inside when Evelyn humiliated me?"

Tears streamed down Bianca's face as she shook her head frantically.

Beatrice shoved her against the wall. "Keep an eye on Evelyn for me. If I find out you're disobeying me..."

She left the threat unfinished, but Bianca's face had already turned ashen.

The flickering bathroom lights cast eerie shadows across Beatrice's twisted expression.

Staring at Bianca's disheveled reflection, she suddenly smiled. "Get out. Remember—you'll never escape my grasp."

As Bianca stumbled out of the bathroom, she faintly heard Beatrice's chilling whisper behind her:

"Evelyn Laurent...this isn't over."
###Chapter 143

Bianca Fairchild's body trembled slightly.

Her nails dug deep into her palms, yet she felt no pain.

Beatrice Quincy admired her pitiful state, a cruel smile curling her crimson lips. "Remember your place."

The words were light as a feather but carried the weight of mountains.

Bianca's lashes fluttered faintly.

She bit down on her lower lip until the metallic tang of blood filled her mouth before releasing it.

Suddenly, Beatrice lost interest.

"How dull."

With a careless flick of her wrist, she slapped Bianca across the face before strutting away in her stilettos.

The restroom was eerily silent.

Bianca slowly unclenched her fists, revealing four crescent-shaped wounds in her palms.

As she adjusted her collar in the mirror, a faint bruise peeked out from her wrist.

"Bianca."

Isabella Valentine rushed out from a stall and seized her wrist.

The bruise looked horrifying under the fVossrescent lights.

"Have you lost your mind?" Isabella's voice shook. "How long has this been going on?"

Bianca tried to pull away, but the grip only tightened.

"Bella, don't ask."

Her whisper was barely audible.

Isabella's eyes reddened. "Do you even know what the Quincy family has been—"

"Please!"

Bianca's voice rose sharply before she immediately lowered her head.

Her shoulders slumped as if all strength had drained from her body.

The faucet dripped faintly.

Each drop echoed loudly in the suffocating silence.

One.

Two.

Bianca stared at her reflection as water trailed down her cheeks.

It was impossible to tell if it was tap water or tears.
###Chapter 144

Isabella trembled with rage, her fists clenched tight.

She had pleaded with Bianca countless times, but the girl remained unmoved.

"You just stood there and took her beating?"

Evelyn strode in on stiletto heels, her sharp gaze pinning Bianca in place.

"Evelyn?"

Isabella immediately shielded Bianca, her eyes wary.

Evelyn's lips curved as she looked past Isabella. "If it were me, she'd be leaving on a stretcher."

"You've trained for years. Black belt in taekwondo."

"Why didn't you fight back?"

Isabella whirled around. "Nonsense! If Bianca knew those skills, how could Beatrice—"

She cut herself off mid-sentence.

Bianca's face turned ashen, her lips trembling wordlessly.

"She does." Evelyn's voice held absolute certainty.

That day in the lab, Bianca's reflexes when shoved had betrayed her.

Evelyn had followed with her drink, just in time to catch Beatrice's threats.

When she pressed record, it reminded her of her own past.

Brandon's fists. Vincent's cold indifference.

But she chose to return violence with violence.

Bianca had the ability yet chose to play the sacrificial lamb.

"What does Beatrice have on you?"

Bianca's pupils contracted violently.

A bitter smile twisted her lips. "Those things...would destroy me."

Not just her grandmother's life.

But that unspeakable secret.

The nightmare coiling around her like a venomous serpent.

No one could save her.

This was her fate.
###Chapter 145

Bianca's words hung in the silence.

The private room became deathly still.

Her fingers dug into her skirt, nails nearly piercing her palms.

Beatrice's constant humiliation was like a dull blade, carving wounds into her heart day after day.

But what could she do?

That secret loomed over her like a sword, ready to strike at any moment.

"Bianca..." Evelyn hesitated, her voice catching.

She watched the trembling girl before her, throat tight.

Isabella slammed her hands on the table. "You're just going to take this? The Quincys can't destroy you!"

Bianca gave a bitter smile.

This spoiled heiress would never understand her position.

"I have the recording," Evelyn said before leaving.

When the door closed, Bianca finally lifted her head.

The mirror reflected her red-rimmed eyes—like a stray cat drenched in rain.

"What took so long?" Julian approached with concern.

Evelyn shook her head and downed her drink in one gulp.

Ethan watched her furrowed brow before turning away.

"Control your sister," he growled, grabbing Xander by the collar.

Xander blinked drunkenly. "Did Bianca cause trouble again?"

"I meant Beatrice," Ethan said coldly. "Or have you disowned her too?"

"She was never my sister!" Xander suddenly roared, shattering his glass.

He staggered toward the exit, muttering, "Not family... never was..."

The hallway lights stretched his shadow long and unsteady, swaying as if he might collapse at any moment.
###Chapter 146

Ethan Sullivan frowned, watching Xander Quincy sway unsteadily before him. He sighed and stepped forward, catching the stumbling man by the arm.

"Careful," he murmured, bracing Xander before he could topple into a nearby table.

The Grand Hyatt was his domain tonight, filled with distinguished guests. A drunken scene was the last thing he needed.

"My sister...not my sister..." Xander slurred, his weight sagging against Ethan.

Ethan scanned the room, debating where to deposit the drunkard—until he spotted Bianca Fairchild approaching with her head bowed.

"Miss Fairchild," he called out.

Bianca's head jerked up, alarm flashing in her eyes. Her face paled when she registered the scene.

"He's had too much," Ethan explained tersely.

Bianca instinctively retreated half a step, but Xander's bleary gaze locked onto her.

"Bianca..." he mumbled, wrenching free from Ethan's grip to stagger toward her.

She bit her lip but stepped forward to catch him, her slender frame buckling slightly under his weight. "Why did you drink so much?"

Ethan signaled security. "Escort him upstairs."

"Thank you, Mr. Sullivan." Bianca nodded gratefully, flanking Xander with a guard on each side as they led him away.

Ethan turned—and nearly collided with a petite figure.

"Evelyn Laurent?" He stared at the girl who'd materialized behind him. "What are you doing here?"

Her gaze tracked the retreating trio. "Something's off about them."

Ethan's pupils constricted. Since when had she become so perceptive?

Before he could respond, Evelyn added coldly, "Xander must've helped Beatrice bully Bianca again. What a scumbag."

Ethan opened his mouth, then shut it. There was no point explaining the complexities to this clueless girl.

Though...she wasn't entirely wrong.

"Ethan." Evelyn's voice trembled slightly with intoxication.

"I'm here." He softened his tone, studying her upturned face.

Alcohol painted delicate pink across her eyelids and cheeks. Her lips glistened under the lights like ripe cherries begging to be tasted.

Ethan's throat moved involuntarily.
###Chapter 147

Evelyn Laurent squinted through her drunken haze, her fingertip lightly tapping Ethan Sullivan's chest.

"If you dare follow Xander Quincy's example..."

Her voice carried a tipsy coquetry, the ending note lifting slightly. "And side with Sophia Lowell against me..."

Ethan caught her wandering fingers, his gaze darkening abruptly.

"Never."

The word rumbled from his chest, each syllable weighted with unshakable conviction.

Evelyn tilted her head, studying him before bursting into giggles.

Her steps faltered, and she swayed into Ethan's arms. He caught her waist effortlessly, the warmth of her skin against his palm stealing his breath.

"I'm not drunk!"

Her protest was bold, but her body melted against him like liquid. The faint scent of gardenias mingled with alcohol, drifting into his senses.

Victoria Langley watched her daughter with a resigned shake of her head. Richard Langley gave his wife's hand a reassuring squeeze.

Upstairs in the suite, Evelyn curled into a kitten-like ball the moment she touched the bed. She tugged weakly at Ethan's sleeve, murmuring incoherently.

"Drink this."

Ethan knelt beside the bed, carefully supporting the nape of her neck. She wrinkled her nose after a sip, turning her face away in distaste.

The soft glow of the bedside lamp cast a rosy hue over her porcelain skin. Ethan's gaze traced the flutter of her lashes down to her slightly parted lips.

He stood abruptly, his Adam's apple bobbing.

The overlapping shadows of the lamplight danced on the wall. Ethan retreated like a man fleeing battle, his fingers trembling as he shut the door behind him.

The next morning, Evelyn stared blankly at the ceiling.

Her temples throbbed from the hangover, yet the memories of last night remained vivid. She grabbed a pillow to smother her face, her toes curling involuntarily.

"Two percent alcohol..."

Counting the empty bottles, she suddenly remembered something and reached for her phone.

In the family group chat, Julian Langley was boasting about his heroic feat of downing three beers the previous night. Evelyn glanced at her own tally of five bottles and quietly exited the conversation.
###Chapter 148

Evelyn Laurent stared blankly at the ceiling.

For the first time in her twenty-something years, she'd discovered her fatal weakness.

She'd always been able to pin Brandon Lowell to the ground since childhood. When bullied, her first instinct was to throw punches.

But now—

She turned out to be a one-drink wonder.

Last night, after that single glass of red wine, the entire world had started spinning.

Thankfully, she was a quiet drunk who simply passed out.

The honey water on her nightstand still steamed faintly.

Evelyn lifted the cup and took a sip.

Sweetness spread across her tongue.

The throbbing in her skull eased slightly.

A memory surfaced—that time Margaret Hill had kidnapped her.

If her captor had forced alcohol down her throat then...

A shiver ran down Evelyn's spine.

This stuff was dangerous.

Never again.

She stretched her limbs and pushed open the bedroom door.

Ethan Sullivan leaned against the opposite wall.

His gentle smile appeared the moment he saw her. "Headache?"

"Manageable."

Evelyn instinctively took half a step back.

"Let's get breakfast." Ethan extended his hand naturally.

She sidestepped the gesture. "I can walk by myself."

He withdrew his hand, smile unwavering. "Of course."

Evelyn studied his retreating figure.

He'd clearly been waiting for her.

But why?

She couldn't be bothered to dwell on it.

The Grand Hyatt's breakfast spread was lavish.

Ethan spent the entire meal catering to her preferences.

Afterwards, he arranged for his driver to take her back to Harvard University.

The moment Evelyn entered the classroom, she felt a venomous glare.

Sophia Lowell hastily averted her eyes.

Evelyn smirked.

This clown again.

She strode directly to her seat.

"Sophia, she's insufferable!"
"How dare she treat you like that?"
"Someone should teach her a lesson!"

Sophia's roommates fumed indignantly.

Sophia adopted a wounded expression. "Don't say that. Evelyn is..."

"You're too kind!"
"Trash like her doesn't belong at Harvard!"

Sophia lowered her head, the corners of her lips curling upward.

Evelyn opened her textbook.

Whispers reached her ears.

She lifted her gaze in one sweeping glance.

The murmuring ceased instantly.

The classroom plunged into eerie silence.
###Chapter 149

Sophia Lowell's lips curved into a gentle smile, her voice soft as a spring breeze.

She arranged her textbooks with elegant precision, as if Evelyn Laurent's existence meant nothing to her.

"Some people simply aren't worth my attention," she murmured, her eyes gleaming with quiet superiority.

Her three roommates immediately clustered around her, chiming in with sycophantic agreement.

"Sophia is so refined and gracious."

"Honestly, Evelyn isn't fit to polish your shoes."

"If she'd laid a hand on me, I'd have called the police immediately!"

A shadow flickered through Sophia's gaze before her demure mask slipped back into place.

"Let's not dwell on such unpleasantness," she said with a dismissive wave. "I never waste energy on petty conflicts."

The girls exchanged knowing glances and fell obediently silent.

Sophia turned her attention to her phone, fingers gliding across the screen.

She typed "The Seventh Lowell Heiress" into the search bar. The sparse results made her lips twitch upward.

The less information available, the easier it would be to exploit the narrative.

She opened Harvard University's campus forum. The top trending post featured photos of her arriving this morning in a luxury car.

The comments section had exploded.

"That ride costs seven figures minimum!"

"Could she be the missing Lowell heiress?"

"I heard the Lowells are searching for their long-lost daughter..."

Sophia smiled at the carefully cultivated speculation.

Even more satisfying was Sebastian Royston's attention.

Though not as prestigious as Ethan Sullivan, Sebastian was still a Royston heir.

Most importantly—

He enjoyed spending money on her.

Her fingers traced the pink diamond bracelet around her wrist, its facets catching the light.

A gift from Sebastian just yesterday.

"Celestia Designs' latest collection," she murmured, positioning her wrist prominently on the desk.

When class ended, excited chatter filled the room.

"Sophia!" gasped a roommate. "That bracelet is stunning!"

"Pink diamonds! I saw this in Vogue!"

"My god, what does something like that cost?"

Sophia gave a practiced laugh, casually tucking a strand of hair behind her ear.

"My brother said it suited me," she replied, turning her wrist to make the gems sparkle.

A chorus of awed admiration rose around her.

"He spoils you rotten!"

"Only the best for a Lowell heiress!"

Sophia basked in their worshipful gazes, already calculating her next move.

If she was going to play this role, she'd do it properly.

She needed more evidence to cement her "Lowell heiress" persona.

And Sebastian Royston would be her perfect stepping stone.
###Chapter 150

Sunlight streamed through the classroom windows. Sophia Lowell lazily lifted her wrist, the pink diamond bracelet from Celestia Designs glinting brilliantly in the light.

"Oh my god! Isn't that the limited edition from Celestia?" Her deskmate gasped, drawing the attention of nearby students.

Sophia blinked with feigned surprise. "Really? My brother just gave it to me casually. I thought it was just an ordinary bracelet."

A chorus of shocked inhales filled the classroom. Everyone knew Celestia Designs was backed by the prestigious Lowell family, with Sebastian Lowell himself as the lead designer.

"Sophia, you don't mean..." someone ventured cautiously.

Sophia pressed a finger to her lips with a mysterious smile. "Shh, it's a secret."

Her ambiguous response instantly changed the atmosphere. Several girls flocked to her side, offering drinks and even straightening her textbooks.

Out of the corner of her eye, Sophia noticed Evelyn Laurent still reading quietly in the corner. Her nails dug into her palms. How dare that bitch ignore her?

"Don't forget your water bottles for PE class this afternoon," the class monitor reminded everyone.

A scheme suddenly formed in Sophia's mind.

After PE, a shrill scream pierced the classroom.

"My bracelet is gone!" Sophia cried, frantically searching her bag with red-rimmed eyes. "It was a birthday gift from my brother!"

Three roommates immediately surrounded her. "It was just here!"

"Could someone have stolen it?" someone whispered.

A bespectacled boy spoke up. "I saw Evelyn leave last when I locked the door."

All eyes turned to Evelyn. She remained seated, not even looking up.

"Evelyn, did you steal it?" One of Sophia's roommates charged forward aggressively.

Evelyn finally lifted her gaze, her expression terrifyingly calm. "Where's your proof?"

"Who else could it be? Give Sophia's bracelet back now!"

The classroom erupted. Some demanded to search bags while others shouted about reporting to the teacher. At the center of the chaos, Sophia allowed herself a barely perceptible smirk.

This time, let's see you wriggle out of this.
###Chapter 151

The classroom was eerily empty, making Evelyn Laurent's vacant seat stand out conspicuously.

Gossip erupted like boiling oil in a pan.

"Walter, are you sure Evelyn was the last one to leave?"

"She always acted so aloof. Who knew she'd stoop to this?"

"Pfft. She's got a history of violence. What's petty theft to someone like her?"

Two factions squared off. Evelyn's supporters clenched their fists while Sophia Lowell's roommates sneered with superiority.

Sophia's eyes were red-rimmed as she frantically emptied her backpack.

"That bracelet was a birthday gift from my brother..." Her voice trembled on the verge of tears.

Her roommates immediately closed ranks around her.

"Don't worry, we'll find it!"

"Search her desk! It's gotta be there!"

Several girls shoved past protesting classmates toward Evelyn's seat. Books scattered across the floor as they yanked out the entire drawer.

"Found it!" One girl triumphantly held up a glinting silver chain.

The room fell silent.

Sophia accepted the bracelet with shaking fingers. "It's mine... But how—"

"What do you mean 'how'?" A roommate scoffed. "The thief's right in front of us!"

"This could be a setup!" someone countered.

"With irrefutable evidence? Stop making excuses!"

The argument nearly blew the roof off.

Evelyn walked in to this exact scene.

"What's going on?" Her quiet voice instantly silenced the room.

Sophia's roommate leapt forward. "Evelyn Laurent! How dare you show your face after stealing Sophia's bracelet?"

"Caught red-handed!"

Evelyn's gaze swept over the ransacked desk before settling on the silver chain in Sophia's hand.

The corner of her mouth curled into a cold smirk.
###Chapter 152

Evelyn's cold eyes narrowed slightly.

Interesting.

Stealing Sophia's bracelet?

Her gaze sharpened like a blade, piercing through Sophia. "Sophia, are you certain I took it?"

Sophia trembled under her stare, her voice barely above a whisper. "Evelyn, how could I suspect you...? But my bracelet was found at your seat..."

Her eyes reddened, the picture of pitiful vulnerability.

Evelyn's smirk hadn't faded when Lillian suddenly gasped. "Wait! Look at Evelyn's wrist—"

"Oh my god, it's the same pink diamond bracelet as Sophia's!"

"But Evelyn's diamonds are clearly larger and more brilliant!"

"Someone who owns a piece like that would never steal an inferior one!"

Murmurs rose around them.

Sophia's head snapped up, her pupils contracting.

The dazzling pink diamond bracelet on Evelyn's wrist shimmered under the sunlight, making Sophia's own look dull in comparison.

How...?

Sophia's nails dug into her palms, her face draining of color.

"Let me see."

Evelyn snatched the bracelet from Sophia's hand, comparing it carelessly to her own.

"Tch."

She shook both bracelets dismissively. "Sophia, your diamond... looks positively malnourished."

"Couldn't afford a proper one, so you settled for this?"

The corner of Evelyn's lips curled in mockery.

This exquisite pink diamond bracelet had been custom-made for her by her second brother—a limited-edition piece.

Sophia's?

Nothing more than a mass-produced trinket.

"Evelyn..." Sophia's voice quivered. "Someone must be trying to drive a wedge between us..."

She forced a smile, though bitterness seethed beneath.

Ethan had actually gifted Evelyn something so extravagant?

Evelyn had no patience for her act. "Pull up the security footage."

"I want to see exactly who dared plant trash at my seat."

She tossed Sophia's bracelet back with a flick of her fingers, wiping her hand in disgust. "Wearing such cheap imitation—how embarrassing."
###Chapter 153

Sophia Lowell's face flushed crimson.

Her knuckles turned white as she clenched the pink diamond bracelet.

"Evelyn Laurent, what do you mean by that?" Her voice trembled.

Evelyn leaned back lazily in her chair, tapping the table with her fingertips.

"Can't understand simple words?" She smirked. "I said you're not worthy."

The room fell silent.

Sophia's friends immediately erupted.

"How dare you say that?"

"That bracelet is a limited edition!"

"Maybe yours is the fake one!"

Evelyn slowly pulled out a gilded certificate from her bag and slapped it on the table.

"Celestia Designs authentication." She arched a brow at Sophia. "Where's yours?"

Sophia's breathing grew ragged.

She suddenly remembered Sebastian Royston's evasive eyes when he gave her the bracelet.

"I... left it at home."

Evelyn laughed.

The sound sent chills down Sophia's spine.

"What a coincidence." Evelyn turned to Lillian Rothschild. "Lillian, what's Celestia's purchase protocol?"

Lillian adjusted her glasses. "Each piece comes with a digital certificate tied to the buyer's ID."

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

She felt everyone's stares like knives against her skin.

"My brother gave me this! It's real!" She forced out the words.

Evelyn stood.

She walked toward Sophia, looking down at her with icy disdain.

"Shall we call your brother right now?" Her voice was soft. "Ask him what he actually bought for you?"

Sophia's pupils contracted.

She realized Evelyn had planned this.

The bitch knew everything.

"I—" Her voice caught in her throat.

Whispers swirled around them.

"Is it really fake?"

"Look at her reaction..."

Evelyn leaned in, whispering words only Sophia could hear:

"This is just the beginning."

Straightening, she smiled at Sophia's ashen face.

"Oh, one more thing." She raised her voice. "My brother Sebastian founded Celestia. Need me to authenticate it for you?"

The words detonated like a bomb.

Sophia's world spun.

Now she understood why Evelyn had targeted the bracelet.

"You—"

"No... I don't..." She stumbled backward.

Evelyn watched her flee, cold satisfaction glinting in her eyes.

The game had only just begun.

She would teach Sophia the true meaning of humiliation.
###Chapter 154

Sophia Lowell's nails dug deep into her palms.

How could she not know about Celestia Designs' policies?

E-invoices? ID registration? She had none of those!

She shot Lillian Rothschild a venomous glare.

This meddlesome woman was to blame!

"If you're so certain, why not show us the e-invoice?" Evelyn Laurent said coolly.

"Yeah, Sophia. You keep accusing Evelyn of stealing. Maybe you're the imposter?"

"Stop throwing baseless accusations around!"

Sophia trembled but forced her chin up. "Why should I prove anything to you? Who do you think you are?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes.

This paper tiger was putting on quite the act.

The game was getting more amusing by the minute.

"Fine. No proof needed." Evelyn leaned lazily against the desk. "Then explain—how did this bracelet end up at my seat?"

Her gaze swept the classroom like a blade before landing on Walter Evans. "You claimed I was the last to leave. But I clearly saw you stay behind."

Walter flinched, his face paling. "Lies!"

"Accessing security footage is child's play for me." Evelyn's voice turned icy. "Should I invite the principal to review the tapes?"

She deliberately drew out her words. "Confess now, or face the consequences."

Sophia's nails bit into her flesh.

When had this bitch become so cunning?

Her eyes darted nervously, but she forced composure.

Evelyn couldn't possibly trace this back to her.

"It was me!" Walter suddenly screamed, breaking down. "I planted the bracelet!"

The classroom erupted.

"You despicable snake!"

"Playing the righteous act earlier? Disgusting!"

Under the barrage of scorn, Walter panicked. "Not my idea! It wasn't me!"

He pointed frantically to the corner. "It was Lydia! Lydia Montgomery made me do it!"

Lydia went deathly pale, her eyes flicking to Sophia.

"How could you do this?" Sophia suddenly shrieked. "Why frame Evelyn?"
###Chapter 155

Sophia Lowell's voice suddenly rose to a deliberately shrill pitch.

She practically begged to be overheard.

Her venomous glare pinned Lydia Montgomery in place. Lydia shuddered under the weight of that look and immediately understood.

"I just couldn't stand Evelyn Laurent!" Lydia spat through gritted teeth. "And Sophia's constant bragging!"

"So I stole the bracelet to frame her!"

"I admit it, okay?"

Evelyn leaned against the desk, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

Sophia moved forward with fake concern, only to be shoved away. Lydia stumbled back like a startled rabbit before fleeing.

"Evelyn..." Sophia's eyes reddened, her voice trembling. "This is all my fault..."

Evelyn didn't even glance at her before turning away.

Sunlight glinted off the pink diamonds on her wrist, casting sharp reflections.

Sophia lowered her head, nails digging deep into her palms.

Strangely, she didn't explode in rage as she usually would.

This numb sense of defeat was somehow even more sickening.

Harvard University's Centennial Gala.

Sophia narrowed her eyes.

If she couldn't touch Evelyn right now, she'd at least prove her worth to Sebastian Royston.

She would stun everyone at the gala.

As for Evelyn...

A cold smile curled Sophia's lips.

Just a bookworm.

"Evelyn!" Lillian Rothschild jogged to catch up. "Let's team up for the gala performance!"

Her eyes sparkled. "You'd dazzle the whole audience just by standing there!"

Evelyn shook her head. "Not interested."

"Come on!" Lillian tugged at her sleeve. "We'll do classical dance. You can just be our beautiful centerpiece!"
###Chapter 156

"Evelyn!" Lillian clasped her hands together, her eyes sparkling like stars. "If we get selected for the talent show, we'll earn two extra credits!"

She bounced toward Evelyn like an excited bunny.

Lillian had always been Evelyn's shadow.

Full of energy, her smile bright as a sunflower.

Now she gazed at Evelyn with hopeful eyes, her lashes fluttering.

Evelyn sighed. "I really can't dance."

Her skills were limited to combat and takedowns.

"No worries!" Lillian beamed. "I'll design the simplest routine. You just need to stand there and look pretty!"

She playfully winked.

Evelyn reluctantly nodded. "Fine."

"Perfect!" Lillian twirled in delight, looping her arm through Evelyn's. "Let me treat you to dinner to celebrate!"

The sudden contact made Evelyn stiffen.

She instinctively tried to pull away.

Lillian immediately released her. "Sorry, sorry! I got too excited."

She remembered Evelyn's aversion to physical touch.

"It's fine." Evelyn shook her head gently.

She didn't dislike Lillian.

The girl's sunny warmth reminded her of sunlit sunflowers.

Years of intense training had just conditioned her to recoil from closeness.

Lillian exhaled in relief and cheerfully hailed a cab. "I found this exclusive private kitchen! It took me a whole month to get a reservation!"

She rattled off an address.

Evelyn frowned slightly.

Why did that sound familiar?

The car stopped before an elegant heritage building.

"Here we are!" Lillian tugged Evelyn's sleeve as they exited. "The chef only serves ten tables a day—super selective!"

Evelyn looked up, her pupils contracting.

Wasn't this the same place Ethan had brought her?

Lillian was already pulling her toward the entrance. "Hurry! They cancel reservations if you're late."

The host meticulously verified their booking before allowing them in.

Evelyn was baffled.

Last time with Ethan, they'd walked right in.

"Check out the menu!" Lillian guided her to a corner table. "Only two dishes per person."

Evelyn stared at the menu in confusion.

Ethan had ordered nearly every signature dish that night.

"Will two dishes be enough?" she couldn't help asking.

Lillian lowered her voice conspiratorially. "The portions look small, but they're surprisingly filling!"

Evelyn grew even more puzzled.

Last time, each plate had been an exquisite work of art...
###Chapter 157

Evelyn Laurent's fingertip traced the menu, pausing briefly at the price column.

Chef's Table was indeed expensive, but every dish had dazzled her during her last visit with Ethan Sullivan. Fresh ingredients, exquisite plating, even the tableware exuded luxury.

Her gaze swept across the dining patrons. A slight frown creased her brow.

The portions were simply too large.

Two women ordering four dishes meant wasted food and limited choices.

"Wait here."

Evelyn suddenly stood.

Lillian Rothschild grabbed her sleeve in panic. "Evelyn?"

Watching Evelyn stride toward the reception desk, Lillian's heart clenched. She hurried after her.

"Do you have private dining available?"

Lillian paled at the cool inquiry. "Evelyn! Private rooms require one-month advance reservations!"

She'd pulled countless strings just to secure this main dining area spot.

Evelyn patted her hand reassuringly before addressing the hostess. "A private room, please."

The hostess offered a professional smile. "May I have your reservation number?"

"No reservation."

The smile froze. "Apologies, but we can't accommodate walk-ins for private dining."

Evelyn considered briefly. "Then we'll take smaller portions to sample more dishes."

The hostess's expression turned peculiar. "Are you certain?"

Lillian stamped her foot anxiously. "Evelyn! They never do half portions here!"

She knew this establishment's ironclad rules. A billionaire had once been permanently blacklisted for demanding a larger private room.

"It's fine." Evelyn remained unruffled.

The hostess's face hardened. "Since you insist on breaking protocol, we must ask you to leave."

"My apologies!" Lillian bowed repeatedly. "My friend didn't understand. We'll return to our table."

She tugged desperately at Evelyn's sleeve, but the other woman stood immovable.

"We're not going back." Evelyn's quiet voice carried steel.
###Chapter 158

The receptionist's face darkened instantly.

"Are you here to cause trouble?"

Evelyn Laurent met her gaze with icy clarity.

"I'm simply exercising my rights as a customer."

When Ethan Sullivan visited last time, he could order anything from the menu, reserve private rooms, and even request half portions.

Why were the rules different for her?

"Miss Sun."

A smooth male voice sounded behind them.

The voice was oddly familiar, but Evelyn didn't bother turning around.

Sebastian Royston stepped beside her, smiling at the receptionist.

"Accommodate the lady's request. Since it's her first visit, I'll take responsibility for any breach of protocol."

Evelyn flicked a glance at him, her expression turning colder as she subtly distanced herself.

This was the third son of the Sullivan family—the same man who had publicly defended Sophia Lowell at the banquet.

The clown she had slapped in front of everyone before Ethan kicked him out.

The receptionist remained impassive.

"Apologies, Mr. Royston. You don't have that authority."

Sebastian's smile froze.

A dangerous glint flashed in his eyes.

"Say that again."

"The owner's orders." Her tone was strictly professional. "You hold no privileges here."

New policy—Sebastian Royston had zero special treatment at this establishment.

His knuckles whitened as he struggled to maintain composure.

"Seems I overstepped."

Turning to Evelyn, he feigned regret.

"Pity I couldn't help."

Evelyn looked at him like he was trash.

"Did I ask for your help?"

Sebastian's fists clenched audibly.

His gentlemanly facade nearly cracked.

This bitch!

"Sister, that's no way to speak!" Sophia Lowell peeked out from behind Sebastian, voice trembling. "Mr. Royston meant well..."

Her words trailed off weakly.

She couldn't control her shaking around Evelyn.

But to impress Sebastian, she forced herself to speak up.

Evelyn's gaze sliced toward her.

"Who gave you permission to interrupt?"

Sophia immediately retreated behind Sebastian.

The receptionist snapped a warning.

"One more disturbance and I'm calling security!"

Evelyn stated calmly,

"Evelyn Laurent."

The name landed like a guillotine.

The receptionist opened her mouth to scoff—then her eyes bulged.

"You...you're Miss Laurent?"

She scrambled from behind the counter, bowing at a perfect ninety degrees.

"My deepest apologies, Miss Laurent! I failed to recognize you!"
###Chapter 159

The entire room fell silent.

Sebastian Royston's face twisted into something terrifying, his eyes churning with dark currents.

His knuckles turned white, teeth clenched so hard he tasted blood.

How perfect.

Ethan Sullivan would go this far for some country bumpkin!

Just a name was enough to make the staff grovel.

Ethan must have given explicit orders—otherwise, why would this waiter change his tune so quickly?

Lillian Rothschild stood frozen, staring blankly at Evelyn Laurent, completely bewildered by the sudden turn of events.

"Prepare a private room."

Evelyn's voice was cool.

"Right away, Miss Laurent."

The waiter fawned, immediately issuing instructions. "The one reserved for Mr. Sullivan—completely private. Enjoy your meal with your friends!"

Evelyn gave a slight nod.

Her gaze swept over Sebastian and Sophia. "Check if they have a reservation."

After a quick search, the waiter replied respectfully, "Miss Laurent, they don't."

A mocking smile curled Evelyn's lips. "Then why are they still standing here?"

The sight of Sophia made her sick.

Both their faces darkened instantly.

"Evelyn Laurent! Do you know who I am? How dare you throw me out?"

Sebastian's eyes flashed with cold fury.

Evelyn scoffed. "Sebastian Royston, the third son of the Royston family."

She lazily rotated her wrist. "Seems like that slap last time wasn't hard enough?"

Sebastian's face turned ashen.

He glared at her with venom. "Fine. Sophia, let's go."

This grudge was now set in stone.

Sophia bit her lip in frustration.

She couldn't accept that Evelyn wielded such influence—even Sebastian had to back down.

Did Ethan value her so much that he'd openly humiliate Sebastian?

Compared to Sebastian, Ethan was clearly the more valuable connection.

The two left in disgrace.

Sebastian stormed off, Sophia scrambling to keep up. At the corner, he suddenly spun around and struck her across the face, sending her sprawling.

"Ah!"

Sophia clutched her cheek, looking up in shock.

Sebastian's expression was twisted, his eyes gleaming with something unhinged. "Enjoyed watching me lose face?"

Sophia frantically shook her head. "No, Sebastian! I didn't—"

He yanked her up by the collar. "Then what the hell is her deal?"

His rage burned.

He'd thought she was just some plaything.
###Chapter 160

Sebastian Royston's expression darkened the moment Sophia Lowell finished speaking.

His fingers tightened unconsciously as he stared at the woman weeping before him.

"Country bumpkin?" Sebastian sneered. "Then explain why Ethan Sullivan would go to such lengths for her."

Sophia froze at the question.

She instinctively touched her stinging cheek, tears still streaming. "She—she's just using her looks—"

"Idiot!" Sebastian suddenly exploded, grabbing her throat. "You think Ethan is the type to be swayed by beauty?"

Sophia's breath cut off instantly.

Her face turned crimson as her nails clawed bloody streaks across Sebastian's hand.

"Let...go..." She struggled desperately, her eyes rolling back.

But Sebastian seemed possessed, his grip tightening. He watched her contorted face with manic gleam in his eyes.

"You all think I'm inferior to Ethan, don't you?"

Sophia could no longer speak.

Her vision blurred as a buzzing filled her ears. The terror of death made her whole body tremble.

Just as she was about to lose consciousness, Sebastian abruptly released her.

"Cough—" Sophia collapsed, gasping for air, her face streaked with tears and snot.

Sebastian looked down at her, leisurely adjusting his cuffs. "Remember. Your life belongs to me now."

Sophia shuddered violently.

She looked up to see Sebastian's handsome face smiling gently, but his eyes were glacial.

"I...I understand..." She crawled forward on trembling limbs, prostrating at his feet like a dog.

Sebastian stroked her hair approvingly—then suddenly backhanded her again.

Slap!

Sophia's head snapped to the side, blood trickling from her lip. But she didn't dare cry out, forcing a servile smile instead.

"You're right to discipline me, Young Master Royston..."

Watching her grovel, Sebastian's eyes flashed with satisfaction. He gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze.

"Remember. I own your life now. Betray me, and—"

"I won't!" Sophia shook her head frantically. "I'll always be yours!"

Sebastian released her and turned toward the window. His silhouette looked especially sinister against the night.

"Evelyn Laurent..." He murmured the name, a vicious glint in his eyes. "Let's see what you're really made of."
###Chapter 161

Xu Peng's fists clenched until his knuckles cracked.

He jerked his head up, his gaze sharp as daggers piercing through He Zong.

"My lord, I finally understand." His voice was low and controlled. "You allowed the water supply to be poisoned. You let the rumors spread. You've been planning to surrender all along."

He Zong's face paled instantly.

"Phoenix City's defenses are impenetrable. Without these 'accidents,' we could have held out for at least half a month." Xu Peng stepped forward, his voice relentless. "Yet you repeatedly ordered reckless attacks, wasting our soldiers' lives. I warned you time and again, but you turned a deaf ear."

His voice suddenly rose. "He Zong, what is your true agenda?"

The hall fell deathly silent.

He Zong's face turned ashen, his fingers trembling as he pointed at Xu Peng. "How dare you slander me!"

"Slander?" Xu Peng sneered. "You cowardly hide behind the people while plotting betrayal. What a noble governor you are!"

Murderous intent flashed in He Zong's eyes.

"Guards!" he bellowed. "Xu Peng has committed insubordination. Take him away and give him thirty lashes!"

Xu Peng stood abruptly, his sword unsheathing with a metallic ring.

"From this day forth, I sever all ties with you, traitor!" He swept his gaze across the room. "Brothers, who will follow me out to fight? We'd rather die than surrender!"

Before the words faded, his blade struck.

The soldiers who had spread the rumors barely had time to react before they fell, blood spraying.

He Zong stumbled back in shock. "You—you dare—"

"Well struck!" A roar erupted in the hall.

Dozens of soldiers rallied behind Xu Peng. "We pledge our lives to the general!"

Wiping blood from his sword, Xu Peng smirked at He Zong. "Try punishing me now. Maybe in your next life."

He raised his arm and shouted, "Open the gates! Charge—!"

The city gates swung wide.

The Liang army, caught off guard, scrambled in disarray. Xu Peng led the charge, cutting through enemy lines like a storm.

He Zong stood atop the city wall, his expression darkening.

"Bring me a bow," he ordered coldly.

His aide hesitated. "My lord, this—"

He Zong snatched the bow, drawing the string taut. "If he wants to die, he won't drag the entire city down with him!"

The arrow whistled through the air.

Xu Peng was about to strike down an enemy commander when he sensed danger. He twisted aside just in time, spotting He Zong's icy glare from the ramparts.

"He Zong!" he roared. "You dare betray us?!"

A second arrow followed.

Seizing the opportunity, the Liang general swung his blade. Trapped between attacks, Xu Peng's advantage vanished.

Below the walls, the battle raged on, blood staining the cobblestones crimson.
###Chapter 162

Lillian Rothschild's eyes sparkled like they were filled with starlight.

She gently waved the menu, her tone sincere. "I've tried all the signature dishes here. You won't be disappointed."

Evelyn Laurent arched an eyebrow at her.

This girl was almost painfully naive, yet oddly endearing.

"Aren't you afraid I might be dangerous?" Evelyn teased.

Lillian tilted her head, then suddenly laughed. "Dangerous people don't help strangers out of tight spots."

She lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Besides, my intuition is never wrong."

Evelyn couldn't help but smile.

It felt strange, like meeting a kindred spirit.

"My treat today," Evelyn said, closing the menu.

Lillian immediately shook her head. "No way! I invited you!"

Her stubborn expression reminded Evelyn of a squirrel guarding its nuts.

Evelyn didn't argue further.

The food arrived quickly.

Lillian eagerly picked up a piece of sweet and sour ribs, her eyes closing in bliss. "Try this! It's amazing!"

Evelyn took a bite. The perfect balance of flavors exploded on her tongue.

They chatted easily between bites, the atmosphere warm and relaxed.

Meanwhile, the restaurant manager was hastily making a phone call.

"Mr. Sullivan, Ms. Laurent is dining at our establishment."

A pause on the other end. "With whom?"

"A girl named Lillian Rothschild. Seems to be a Harvard student."

Ethan Sullivan hung up and grabbed his coat.

When he arrived, laughter spilled from the private dining room.

Evelyn's laughter—but lighter than he'd ever heard it.

Ethan lingered outside the door, his lips curving unconsciously.

He settled onto a hallway sofa and opened his laptop, pulling up surveillance footage.

Sophia Lowell and Sebastian Royston flashed across the screen.

Ethan's expression darkened.

His fingers clenched when he spotted the necklace around Sophia's throat.

The one he'd given Evelyn.

"Harrison, run a background check on Lillian Rothschild," he ordered his assistant.

The private room door swung open.

Lillian emerged arm-in-arm with Evelyn, both still smiling.

"Ethan?" Lillian's eyes widened in recognition.

He gave a curt nod, his gaze locked on Evelyn.

Evelyn ignored him completely, steering Lillian toward the exit.

Lillian glanced back over her shoulder, her lips quirking with secret amusement.

Outside, Evelyn's phone vibrated.

A notification appeared:

[Lillian Rothschild's dossier sent to your inbox]

Sender: Ethan Sullivan.

Evelyn's eyes turned to ice.
###Chapter 163

Evelyn Laurent shot a glance at Lillian Rothschild beside her and lowered her voice. "Wait for me."

Her skirt swirled sharply as she turned.

Lillian crouched under the shade of a tree outside the shop, biting her straw as she watched Evelyn's figure disappear behind the glass door.

Evelyn strode straight to the booth at the very back.

"Explain." Her fingertips tapped against the marble tabletop.

Ethan Sullivan leisurely tucked away his phone. "Routine background check."

The screen still displayed Lillian's student records.

Evelyn suddenly leaned forward, bracing her hands on the table. Her long hair cascaded down, brushing against Ethan's knuckles with a faint sting.

"You crossed the line."

Each word dripped with ice.

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed. The delicate scent of jasmine from her hair clashed starkly with her tone.

"Cloudhaven hasn't been safe lately," he murmured, reaching for her wrist. "That transfer student last time—"

Evelyn jerked her hand away.

"Mr. Sullivan." Her lips curled into a cold smile. "Need I remind you of Clause Three?"

No interference in personal affairs.

The light in Ethan's eyes dimmed. He remembered last month in the library, when Evelyn had pushed his offered umbrella back at him just like this.

"My apologies." He loosened his tie. "It won't happen again."

The glass door slammed shut with a deafening crash.

Lillian startled, jumping to her feet as Evelyn stormed out, her face stormy.

"Let's go." She grabbed Lillian's wrist.

Ethan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, watching the two girls scramble into a taxi. He pulled out a cigarette case, then shoved it back into his pocket with frustration.

His phone screen lit up.

[Old Man: Family dinner next Wednesday. Bring Ms. Laurent.]

He stared at the message for a long moment before flipping the phone facedown on the table.

When the waiter came to clear the coffee cups, he found the coaster crumpled into a twisted paper ball.
###Chapter 164

Evelyn Laurent strode out of Chef's Table in her high heels.

The sunlight made her squint.

A shrill laugh cut through the air nearby.

Lillian Rothschild stood trapped between three women like a cornered animal.

"Well, if it isn't the Cooper family's discarded bastard?" The lead woman flicked her diamond bracelet, her rhinestone nails glinting.

Her lackey sneered. "She must've heard Madam was coming and waited here on purpose!"

Lillian clenched her fists until her knuckles turned white. "I'm just here to eat."

"You?" The woman laughed mockingly. "A place like this is beneath you."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes.

She recognized the gaudy woman as Madeline Clemenson, current matriarch of the Cooper family.

"Move." Madeline's face darkened. "You're bad luck."

She raised her hand to shove Lillian.

"Stop!"

Evelyn's voice sliced through the air like a blade.

Everyone froze.

Madeline's lackey eyed Evelyn up and down. "Who let the waitstaff out? Escort us already!"

Evelyn walked straight to Lillian's side.

The faint scent of gardenias clung to the younger woman.

"Are you okay?" she murmured.

Lillian shook her head, eyes reddening.

"Cut the act!" the lackey shrilled. "They're clearly in cahoots!"

Madeline finally looked at Evelyn properly. "Little girl, meddling brings trouble."

Evelyn gave a soft laugh.

She turned to the approaching security. "Ban these women from entering again."

Madeline's face twisted.

"Do you know who I am?" Her lipstick-smudged mouth trembled.

Evelyn adjusted her cufflinks leisurely. "Madam Cooper, correct?"

Her gaze turned glacial. "Not anymore."

As the lackeys sputtered, the restaurant manager rushed over.

"Miss Laurent, why are you standing here?" Beads of sweat dotted his forehead. "Your private dining room is ready."

Dead silence fell.

Madeline's expression froze.

Evelyn took Lillian's hand. "Come, I'm treating you to lunch."

Behind them, a glass shattered against the floor.
###Chapter 165

Madame Cooper looked down her nose at Evelyn Laurent, her red lips curling in disdain. "Do you know who I am? How dare you speak to me like that."

Evelyn's gaze was icy. "Get lost."

"Who do you think you are?"

"Tired of living, bitch?"

Several women rolled up their sleeves, their faces twisted with arrogance.

To them, Evelyn was just some nobody with no connections—otherwise, why would she associate with someone like Lillian Rothschild?

Evelyn didn’t even lift an eyelid.

In the next moment, black-clad security guards emerged from the shadows, forming a protective circle around her.

"Make them disappear," Evelyn said softly. "Permanently."

The women paled. "You—"

Slap!

A sharp crack cut her off.

"Watch your mouth," the head guard growled. "This lady is under Mr. Sullivan’s protection."

Madame Cooper finally lost her composure. "I’m from the Cooper family—"

"The Coopers?" The guard scoffed. "You’re nothing compared to Mr. Sullivan."

Lillian stood frozen, her eyes reddening.

She hadn’t expected Evelyn to stand up for her.

"I just hate people who look down on others," Evelyn said coolly.

Lillian suddenly threw her arms around her. "Sister Evelyn! From now on, you’re my real sister!"

Her almond-shaped eyes shone with admiration, bright and intense.

Ethan Sullivan stepped out of the shadows. "Who was that woman earlier?"

"Madame Cooper of Cooper Realty Group," the head guard answered with a bow.

"Cooper Realty..." Ethan idly twisted the ring on his pinky. "Time for them to go bankrupt."

On their way back to campus, Lillian spilled everything like an overturned basket.

Turns out, she had once saved the young master of the Cooper family, only to be slandered as a gold-digging schemer.

"They’ve been chasing me like rabid dogs," Lillian huffed, gesturing wildly. "But now that I have Sister Evelyn, let’s see them try!"

Evelyn gave a quiet hum.

The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the ground.

"Sister Evelyn..." Lillian suddenly stopped walking, turning to face her with solemn eyes. "Thank you."

Evelyn ruffled her hair, a faint smile touching her lips.

This silly girl deserved kindness.
###Chapter 166

The business landscape of the capital underwent a silent transformation that day. The name Cooper Realty Group vanished from all major commercial rankings, along with several smaller companies affiliated with them.

Evelyn Laurent showed no interest in these corporate shifts.

"Ah—"

A piercing scream shattered the campus tranquility as soon as Evelyn stepped through Harvard University's gates. Lillian Rothschild flinched and instinctively grabbed Evelyn's sleeve.

Around the corner of the academic building, Sophia Lowell sat slumped on the ground, hands clutching her throat. Blood seeped between her fingers, staining her pristine white collar.

"Help..." Sophia's voice trembled uncontrollably. Staring at the blood on her palms, her pupils contracted violently as her entire body shook.

Students quickly gathered around.

"Are you okay?"
"Call 911!"
"Oh God, so much blood..."

Sophia suddenly looked up, her gaze sharp as a blade piercing through the crowd. "Someone stole my necklace!" she shrieked hysterically. "It was my brother's token!"

Several male students immediately offered to help search.

But the surveillance footage left everyone exchanging bewildered glances.

"There's... no one there?"
"It was clearly just a kite string."
"Could she be having a mental breakdown?"

Sophia felt plunged into icy darkness. She'd distinctly felt someone violently yank the necklace away, yet the cameras only showed her colliding with a stray kite string.

The wound on her neck burned fiercely.
The bare skin reminded her - Ethan Sullivan's precious token was truly gone.

A chill crept up her spine.

Her head snapped up, meeting Evelyn's glacial stare across the crowd. Sophia's nails dug deep into her palms.

Evelyn did this!
Yet she lacked even the courage to confront her.
###Chapter 167

Sophia Lowell stood before the clinic mirror, her fingertips lightly brushing the bandage on her neck.

The memory of her necklace being snatched away flashed relentlessly in her mind.

Who was it?

She bit her lower lip, Ethan Sullivan's indifferent face surfacing in her thoughts.

It couldn't be him.

Ethan had seen that necklace before, yet he'd always treated her with detached politeness.

Evelyn Laurent's face suddenly intruded into her consciousness.

Sophia's fingers clenched abruptly.

That necklace had originally belonged to Evelyn.

Had Ethan discovered the truth?

The thought sent a chill down her spine.

Sebastian Royston, that lunatic, had ordered her to get close to Ethan—but now...

Her phone buzzed inside her purse.

Seeing Margaret Hill's name on the caller ID, she took a deep breath before answering.

"Mom."

"Sophia, your father's condition has worsened..." Margaret's voice trembled with tears. "The company—"

"The company is being managed," Sophia interrupted. "The Sullivan heir is overseeing it."

After hanging up, she let out a cold laugh.

The Lowell Group had long been mostly under Sebastian's control.

These so-called family members were nothing but dead weight.

She unlocked her phone, and a charity donation notification popped up.

An anonymous donation of fifty million.

The signature bore only a single word: "Lowell."

Sophia's eyes lit up.

Sebastian was a viper—she couldn't stake all her hopes on him.

But if she could secure Ethan's favor...

Staring at that surname, a bold plan took shape in her mind.
###Chapter 168

Harrison Whitmore knocked lightly on the office door before entering with permission.

"Sir, the necklace has been retrieved."

He held out an exquisite velvet box containing the necklace that once belonged to Sophia Lowell. Professional treatment had erased all traces of her scent.

Ethan Sullivan accepted the box, his slender fingers tracing the intricate patterns.

This necklace carrying his mother's memories had finally returned to him.

His mother's passing came too soon, her face fading in his memory. Now holding the recovered heirloom, Ethan felt a storm of emotions.

Evelyn Laurent... do you remember this necklace?

His gaze flickered before carefully storing the necklace alongside the woven charm bracelet.

The time for testing her wasn't ripe yet.

Rash actions would only push Evelyn further away. Relationships needed careful cultivation, not haste.

Ethan continued teaching at Harvard University. As class representative, Sophia Lowell repeatedly tried approaching him, only to be deliberately avoided.

Sophia bit her lower lip in frustration.

She began orchestrating a performance in the class group chat.

"Oops, wrong screenshot." Sophia quickly retracted an image, but someone had already saved it.

"Oh my god! Sophia donated 50 million?"

"I saw it! She's so generous!"

The group chat exploded.

Isabella Valentine stared at her phone with a cold smile. The obviously photoshopped donation receipt couldn't fool her.

But she chose silence.

Doubting voices soon drowned under Sophia's supporters.

"You're just jealous!"

"Don't question others' kindness when you can't match it!"

Critics fell silent.

The chat soon overflowed with fawning praise.

"Sophia's beauty matches her heart!"

"Only the seventh Lowell heiress could be this generous!"

Everyone scrambled to flatter this "Lowell heiress," terrified of missing their chance to curry favor.
###Chapter 169

The class group chat exploded with activity.

Sophia Lowell couldn't suppress the smug grin tugging at her lips as she scrolled through the endless stream of flattery.

"Everyone, please—let's keep it low-key," she typed with faux humility, adding a shy emoji for good measure.

Isabella Valentine observed coldly, noting the barely concealed triumph in Sophia's every expression.

This girl was definitely up to something.

Five million? Sophia couldn't even scrape together fifty grand.

But Isabella couldn't be bothered to expose her. Clowns like this always tripped over their own feet eventually.

She'd just sit back and enjoy the show.

Evelyn Laurent remained oblivious to the commotion. She'd long muted these pointless notifications.

The moment she stepped into the classroom, Isabella blocked her path.

"Something wrong?" Evelyn's tone was frosty.

Their last collaboration had been a fluke. She had zero interest in dealing with this spoiled heiress again.

"Was it you who donated the five million?" Isabella whispered.

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "You investigated me?"

"So it was you." Isabella exhaled in relief and quickly explained how Sophia was taking credit for the donation.

A humorless laugh escaped Evelyn as her eyes flicked toward Sophia, currently holding court like a queen bee.

Stealing from her again?

Even charity donations weren't off-limits?

Most of their classmates were fawning over Sophia. Evelyn returned to her seat without a word.

She opened the donation site and transferred another two million.

This money would help countless children. That alone made it worthwhile.

And incidentally... she'd just built Sophia a taller pedestal to fall from.

Ethan Sullivan once said: the higher they're lifted, the harder they crash.

Sophia was basking in the adoration when the site refreshed—another two million donated under "E."

Her eyes bulged. Jealousy made her fingers tremble.

Seven million total? Was this person a money-printing machine?

Why didn't anyone shower her with cash like this?
###Chapter 170

The medical expenses for Vincent and Brandon were draining the Lowell family's savings like a bottomless pit.

Sophia stood in the hospital corridor, staring through the glass window at Vincent's unconscious form.

He lay pale as a ghost, still unresponsive.

From the neighboring room, Brandon's agonized screams pierced her temples like needles.

Margaret emerged, clutching a stack of payment slips, tears streaking her cheeks.

"Mom, how much this time?" Sophia asked, suppressing her irritation.

Margaret shook her head, voice trembling. "The doctor says Vincent needs imported medication... Brandon requires a third surgery..."

Sophia turned away before she could finish.

As the elevator doors closed, she kicked the wall hard.

The three million from Vincent Sullivan had vanished like smoke.

And that bitch Evelyn had casually donated seventy million!

Her fists clenched until her nails dug into her palms.

——

Harvard University buzzed with preparations for its centennial gala.

Lillian led the Physics Department girls through dance rehearsals in the studio.

Evelyn executed a flawless final turn before the mirror, moving in sync with the music.

"Perfection!" Lillian clapped excitedly. "Evelyn, you've truly never studied dance?"

Wiping her brow, Evelyn smiled. "Just some tai chi with an elder in my village."

"Liar!" A girl pinched her arm playfully. "This flexibility screams professional training!"

Laughter filled the studio.

Meanwhile, disjointed piano notes drifted from the music room.

The technically demanding Reminiscences of Don Juan sounded like shattered glass under clumsy fingers.

Passing students quickened their steps.

Sophia slammed the keys, teeth gritted.

She would stun everyone at the gala.

In the student council office, she slid a carefully wrapped gift toward a senior.

"About my performance slot..."

The senior adjusted his glasses, smiling cryptically.

At rehearsals, Evelyn's dance earned thunderous applause.

Lillian tugged her arm excitedly. "Evelyn! Let's add a solo for you!"

Before Evelyn could respond, she caught Sophia's venomous glare from backstage.

Their eyes locked—sparks flying in the charged air.

Three days until the gala. Final rehearsals began.
###Chapter 171

Sophia Lowell finally had a rough draft of her piano composition.

But she had secretly altered the sheet music.

She deleted most of the complex notes and simplified the difficult passages.

The original version was too challenging for her.

At least this version was listenable.

She fantasized about the audience's stunned reaction when she performed at the Centennial Gala.

Everyone would be captivated by her talent.

Perhaps she could even climb the social ladder through this opportunity.

Sophia brimmed with confidence.

She had deliberately avoided Evelyn Laurent these past weeks.

The slap mark on her face had finally faded.

No longer needing foundation to cover the bruise, she looked radiant.

Between piano practices, she meticulously maintained her persona.

Those around her truly believed she was the seventh daughter of the Lowell family, treating her with reverence.

The adoration made her giddy.

"Evelyn, we're up next! I'm so nervous!"

Lillian Rothschild clutched Evelyn's skirt, her chest heaving.

Usually lively and cheerful, she couldn't control her racing heart before such a major performance.

This rehearsal would determine their program's performance order.

Evelyn wore a rare aqua-blue gown for the occasion.

The classical dance dress gave her an ethereal grace, her water sleeves flowing with natural elegance.

"Treat it like a regular practice." She patted Lillian's shoulder.

Other teammates gathered around.

"I'm really nervous too," someone whispered.

They all admired Evelyn's composure.

No matter the situation, this girl remained unflappable.

Lillian took a deep breath.

"Let's do this! We're the best!"

"We're the best!" The girls cheered each other on.

Sophia overheard them and curled her lip in disdain.

Her gaze landed on Evelyn.

That exquisite dance dress drew a scornful glint in her eyes.

How dare a country bumpkin perform? She must have pulled strings to get on stage.

Sophia had specially rented a diamond-encrusted gown for today.

The white skirt sparkled with countless crystals, guaranteed to dazzle under the lights.

She would stun the audience like a princess.

Even though this was just a rehearsal, she came fully prepared.

It was Sophia's turn to perform.

She glided gracefully to the piano and bowed to the judges.

But she hit the wrong note immediately.

Though she recovered, the difficult passages sounded stiff and awkward.

The judges exchanged glances.

They soon stopped her performance, assigning her a late slot without ceremony.

Sophia bit her lip as she stepped offstage, eyes burning with resentment.

Then it occurred to her—saving her best for the actual performance would make an even bigger impact.

Chin lifted like a proud peacock, she swept off the stage.
###Chapter 172

On the other side of the stage, the judges whispered among themselves.

"What was that? Just showing off technique with no substance."

"Completely missed the soul of the piece. Too eager to impress."

"This is an insult to music itself."

They shook their heads before turning their attention back to the stage.

Evelyn Laurent's performance was about to begin.

Lillian Rothschild stood in the center position, with Evelyn taking the secondary center spot.

Sophia Lowell burst into laughter at the sight.

Crossing her arms, she stared at Evelyn with undisguised contempt.

How dare some country bumpkin take the secondary center position?

The music began.

Ten dancers moved in perfect harmony.

Their water sleeves flowed like liquid silk, blending strength and grace in mesmerizing patterns.

Sophia's mocking smile froze.

Her expression shifted from derision to shock, then twisted into bitter jealousy.

Impossible... Since when could Evelyn dance?

Hadn't she grown up in some backwater village?

Sophia trembled with rage.

This was only the rehearsal.

Yet Evelyn executed every move with flawless precision, her expressions perfectly controlled.

Though positioned second, she outshone even Lillian in the lead role.

The dance concluded.

Thunderous applause erupted through the auditorium.

Lillian excitedly grabbed Evelyn's hand. "You were amazing!"

Evelyn offered a faint smile.

While the other dancers gasped for breath, she didn't even break a sweat.

After heated discussion, the judges selected their performance as the opening act.

"Perfect!" Lillian babbled excitedly. "We did it!"

Even Evelyn's lips curved slightly at her enthusiasm.

Unbeknownst to her...

In the last row of the auditorium, Ethan Sullivan watched intently behind his mask.

His gaze hadn't left Evelyn since she stepped onstage.

Now observing her surrounded by admirers, warmth flickered in his eyes.

His little rose never failed to surprise him.

Wherever she went, she shone brightest.

Ethan could already imagine how many jaws would drop during the actual Centennial Gala.

A country bumpkin?

Please.

Those who underestimated her would soon regret it.
###Chapter 173

The dress rehearsal finally concluded, and the program lineup for Harvard University's Centennial Gala was finalized.

Sophia Lowell stared at the performance list, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Her act was scheduled third from last—a position most likely to be forgotten by the audience.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Laurent's performance was prominently placed as the opening act.

"Unfair..." she muttered under her breath, her eyes burning with envy.

The dressing room lights cast shadows over her twisted expression.

Suddenly, a cold smirk curled her lips.

"If you're so desperate for the spotlight..."

On the day of the gala, Harvard University was adorned with festive decorations.

The auditorium was packed to capacity as distinguished guests were ushered to their seats by staff.

Ethan Sullivan occupied the prime center seat, his gaze repeatedly flickering toward the backstage entrance.

Richard Langley and Victoria Langley had canceled important meetings just to witness their daughter's performance.

"Darling, is this angle good?" Victoria adjusted the focus on her professional camera.

"A little more to the left," Richard replied nervously, rubbing his hands together. "We must capture every perfect moment of Evelyn."

Backstage, the top stylist brought by Sebastian Langley was putting the final touches on the performers.

"Oh my... Evelyn..." Lillian Rothschild gasped at Evelyn's reflection in the mirror.

Evelyn smiled faintly, the sequins at the corners of her eyes twinkling like stars under the lights.

"Tonight belongs to you," she whispered. "Believe in yourself."

Sophia lurked at the corridor's edge, peering through the door crack at the scene.

She bit her lower lip until the metallic tang of blood filled her mouth.

"Just wait..." She vanished into the shadows.

In the auditorium, murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Isn't that the Langley brothers?"

"Alexander Langley flew back from abroad for this?"

"Wasn't Nathaniel Langley in the middle of an experiment?"

The arrival of the Langley siblings drew countless awed glances.

Backstage, Julian Langley monitored the event via video call.

"Zoom in, damn it!" he barked into his phone. "I need to see Evelyn!"

Meanwhile, Evelyn stood in the wings, waiting for the music to begin.

Unbeknownst to her, the center stage floor had been tampered with...
###Chapter 174

"Who came up with this ridiculous rule?" Theodore Langley kicked the sofa violently, his eyes glued to the live stream on his phone.

Julian Langley gritted his teeth. "Are the producers out of their minds? They won't even approve family leave!"

He desperately wanted to rush back to Harvard University right now.

In the video Ethan Sullivan sent, Evelyn Laurent looked breathtakingly beautiful in her dance dress. Her graceful movements and radiant smile made his heart tremble.

"This is all your fault!" Theodore suddenly turned and glared at Julian. "If you hadn't dragged me into filming this stupid show, I could be there cheering for Evelyn right now!"

Even their eldest brother, who was abroad, had made a special trip back. Yet here they were, stuck in this lousy studio watching a live stream.

Julian was fuming, mentally cursing the production crew eight hundred times.

The two brothers alternated between watching the stream and ranting about the blurry footage. They looked like two lions with their hackles raised.

Meanwhile, in Harvard University's auditorium...

Alexander Langley sat in the VIP section with his three younger brothers and Ethan, their burning gazes fixed on the stage. The dean's speech buzzed in their ears like an annoying fly, completely ignored.

Five strikingly handsome men seated in a row drew frequent glances from the female students around them.

"Why are so many Langley men here this year?"
"I heard their youngest sister Evelyn is performing tonight."
"So lucky to have so many brothers doting on her..."

Whispers floated through the air.

Nearby, Sophia Lowell's roommate nudged her. "Sophia, your family's here. Aren't you going to say hello?"

Sophia clenched her fists, forcing a smile. "It's too formal an occasion. Not the right time."

Her gaze greedily swept over the Langley brothers, bitterness and longing twisting inside her.

These elite men should have been her brothers!

The stage lights suddenly dimmed.

Sophia's eyes gleamed, a cold smirk curling her lips.

The show was about to begin.

Ten graceful figures stepped onto the stage. Under the spotlight, Evelyn in her white dress looked like a moonlit fairy.

The music began.

The moment she moved into her first pose, the entire auditorium fell silent.

Everyone held their breath.
###Chapter 175

Evelyn Laurent's water sleeve dance reached its climax.

She spun gracefully, the flowing sleeves tracing elegant arcs through the air.

Then—

Her right foot landed on a loose floorboard.

A sharp crack echoed across the stage.

Evelyn lost her balance instantly.

Gasps erupted from the audience.

"Watch out!"

Her nearest dance partner cried out in alarm.

Evelyn's eyes flashed with determination.

She shifted her weight swiftly, braced her right hand against the floor, and executed a flawless side flip to safety.

But her two companions weren't as fortunate.

"Aah—"

Their screams pierced the air as they crashed onto the collapsing stage.

Dr. Gregory Evans shot up from his seat.

"What happened?!"

His face darkened with fury.

Evelyn rushed to the damaged section.

She grabbed both girls' wrists and hauled them up with a firm tug.

"Are you hurt?"

The shaken dancers shook their heads.

"Just... startled..."

University officials swarmed the scene.

Stagehands scrambled to inspect the damage.

The performance came to an abrupt halt.

In the audience, Victoria Langley clutched her husband's hand.

Her nails dug into his palm.

The four Langley brothers tensed simultaneously.

Ethan Sullivan's gaze turned glacial.

The intensity of his stare sent chills through nearby spectators.

Dr. Evans double-checked each student's condition.

"That was far too dangerous..."

He wiped cold sweat from his brow.

At the opposite end of the auditorium, Sophia Lowell bit her lip in disappointment.

"She didn't fall..."

Her resentful glare remained fixed on Evelyn.

The stage was quickly repaired.

The show resumed.

But tension still hung thick in the air.
###Chapter 176

Sophia Lowell clenched the program sheet, her knuckles turning white. She suppressed her resentment, forcing a concerned expression as she whispered with classmates about the recent mishap.

After emergency repairs, the stage was finally restored. The centennial gala at Harvard University resumed only after thorough safety checks by the crew.

Despite the accident, the dance team's performance dazzled the audience. Though the two injured girls moved stiffly—one limping slightly, the other nursing scrapes on her arm.

As the final note faded, thunderous applause erupted.

Countless admiring gazes fixed on Evelyn Laurent and Lillian Rothschild. Especially Evelyn—this girl from the countryside stunned everyone with her extraordinary grace.

Sophia listened to the unending applause, her nails digging into her palms. She never expected Evelyn to escape unscathed.

Backstage, Lillian urged the injured dancers to visit the infirmary. She turned to Evelyn with concern. "Are you really alright?"

"I'm fine." Evelyn smiled faintly, but a sharp glint flashed in her eyes.

Too convenient. The exact spot where she stood had malfunctioned. Had she not reacted swiftly, she would've been the first to fall.

Evelyn discreetly examined the broken plank. Clear saw marks lined the edges, and the nails were loose. This was no accident.

She changed calmly and returned to her seat, sensing several intense stares. Meeting Victoria Langley's worried gaze, she offered a reassuring smile.

Her phone lit up with unread messages—her parents, brothers, and Ethan Sullivan all inquiring about her condition.

She replied to each before settling back to watch the remaining performances.

In the audience, Victoria and the others visibly relaxed. Ethan, however, typed rapidly on his phone, his expression icy.

He wasn't texting Evelyn. He was mobilizing his team to review the stage surveillance footage. That broken plank reeked of sabotage.

Whoever dared tamper with Harvard's centennial gala had nerves of steel. What unsettled Ethan more was how the scheme seemed targeted at Evelyn.

The thought darkened his eyes, a dangerous aura radiating from him.
###Chapter 177

Alexander Langley's face darkened as he dialed the phone.

He had to investigate the accident during his sister's performance.

The loose stage edge was no coincidence.

If Evelyn Laurent had actually fallen... A cold glint flashed in Alexander's eyes.

The gala continued.

Backstage, Sophia Lowell took deep breaths.

She repeated to herself that she would dazzle the audience.

Her smile froze when she scanned the seats.

Ethan Sullivan's chair was empty.

What shocked her more—the Lowell couple and her four brothers had also disappeared.

The host called her name a second time before she snapped back to reality.

Under the spotlight, she walked toward the piano in her white dress.

The judges frowned the moment the music began.

The challenging piece sounded fragmented under her fingers.

But Sophia was lost in self-admiration.

As the final note faded, she rose gracefully.

Only scattered applause greeted her.

The judges scribbled notes without looking up.

The VIPs in the front row didn't even glance her way.

Sophia stepped off the stage, her face pale.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.
###Chapter 178

Sophia Lowell stood backstage, her fingertips trembling slightly.

Her performance had been flawless. So why hadn't the audience erupted in thunderous applause?

What unsettled her more was Ethan Sullivan's empty seat.

"Sophia, are you okay?" Her roommate Lydia handed her a water bottle with concern.

Sophia forced a smile. "Just tired."

"Why did your family leave early?" Lydia glanced around. "They missed your grand finale."

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

"They went to the VIP lounge." Her voice remained sweet, but her eyes darkened. "They said they have a surprise for me."

Lydia's face lit up with admiration. "Only the Lowells get such special treatment!"

A genuine smile finally touched Sophia's lips.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Laurent massaged her temples.

That piano recital had been auditory torture. How had Sophia managed to hit every wrong note?

And the girl had looked positively enraptured with herself.

Evelyn shook her head, noticing her parents had already left. The Lowells had shown remarkable restraint by staying this long.

"Let's go," she murmured to Lillian Rothschild.

They slipped out unnoticed—or so they thought.

Sophia slithered after them like a venomous snake.

She'd discover who this imposter was meeting!

"Miss Lowell!"

A male voice halted her.

Sophia looked up at a tall young man in a tailored suit, his designer watch glinting under the lights.

"I'm Nigel Winthrop." He lowered his voice. "Heir to Winthrop Realty."

Sophia's pupils dilated.

While not among the elite four families, the Winthrops were still high society. Why would he know her?

"The pleasure is mine." She extended her hand gracefully, pulse racing.

Nigel grasped it eagerly. "The honor is all mine, Miss Lowell."

A sudden realization struck Sophia.

Did he...mistake her for Evelyn?

The thought ignited equal parts fury and excitement. If true...this misunderstanding could prove useful.
###Chapter 179

Sophia Lowell's eyes glimmered as her lips curved into the perfect smile. "It's an honor to meet you, Nigel."

Her plan to follow Evelyn had completely vanished from her mind.

Now, her gaze was fixed solely on Nigel Winthrop.

The heir to Winthrop Realty was far superior to that pathetic Sebastian Royston.

Sebastian was nothing but a loser in the Royston family's power struggle—not even comparable to his two older brothers.

But Nigel was the genuine heir to a prestigious fortune.

If she could latch onto this golden opportunity...

Sophia's heartbeat quickened, her fingers unconsciously twisting the fabric of her skirt.

She tilted her head slightly, showcasing her best profile, her eyes brimming with calculated allure.

Nigel gave her a warm smile. "Your piano skills are truly impressive, Miss Lowell."

A flicker of mockery passed through his gaze.

That disjointed performance earlier had been nothing short of a disgrace to music.

Yet his gentlemanly facade remained intact.

"Really?" Sophia's eyes widened in feigned delight before she demurely pressed her lips together. "You flatter me, Nigel."

She hastily pulled out her phone, not wanting to miss this chance.

Her fingers trembled slightly as they exchanged contact information.

Nigel's smile deepened.

The prey had taken the bait.

If he could leverage the influence of the seventh Lowell daughter, Winthrop Realty's crisis would be resolved effortlessly.

His gaze discreetly assessed Sophia.

The limited-edition sports car, the priceless pink diamond bracelet, the entourage trailing behind her.

And most telling—her atrocious piano skills.

If she were truly a well-bred heiress of the Lowell family, how could she be so inept?

It only confirmed her identity.

"Call me Sophia," she cooed, her eyes tilting upward with practiced charm.

Nigel obliged smoothly. "Then you must call me Nigel as well."

They exchanged smiles, each hiding their own agenda.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had already slipped into the black Maybach parked by the curb.

"Are you hurt?" Victoria Langley gripped her daughter's wrist.

Evelyn shook her head. "I'm fine, Mom."

Her muscle memory had reacted faster than her thoughts.

It was instinct honed from countless brushes with death.

Victoria exhaled in relief, only to notice the darkening storm in her daughter's eyes.

Evelyn stared out the window, her gaze turbulent with unspoken fury.
###Chapter 180

Zhu Yuanzhang's pupils contracted violently. His teacup shattered against the table with a sharp crack.

"I can register these two hundred acres under different officials' names." Zhu Xiongying's voice held terrifying calm. "Each plot declared at the minimum six-dan grain tax rate. The imperial treasury wouldn't collect a single grain."

The hall plunged into dead silence.

Tang He's ivory tablet clattered to the floor. Eunuch Feng stumbled back three steps.

Zhu Yuanzhang's knuckles turned white.

"Outrageous!" The emperor's palm struck the dragon table with thunderous force. "You dare teach me tax evasion?!"

Xiongying calmly folded his hands. "Your Majesty sees clearly. This is the unwritten rule of officialdom. Landlords register under officials to avoid taxes—mutually beneficial arrangements."

His voice suddenly sharpened. "The only cure is 'equal taxation for officials and gentry'!"

A vein throbbed at Zhu Yuanzhang's temple.

"There's more." Xiongying met the emperor's gaze unflinchingly. "Officials' salaries are too meager. Without corruption, they can't survive!"

"Nonsense!" The emperor roared. "Our Ming laws are strict. Who dares embezzle?"

"Precisely because of this." The crown prince stood his ground. "An honest official isn't necessarily good. After decades of study, if one can't feed his family, who would advocate for the people?"

Zhu Yuanzhang looked thunderstruck. A piece of the dragon armrest splintered under his grip.

"Grandfather." Xiongying suddenly knelt and kowtowed. "When I ascend the throne, I will abolish these corrupt practices!"

"Treason!" The emperor kicked over the imperial table. "Guards! Seize this traitor!"

Commander Hu's legs buckled. "Your Majesty, reconsider—"

"Reconsider?" Zhu Yuanzhang bared his teeth in a snarl. "He's tired of living! Feng Gui! Where lies our easternmost territory?"

The eunuch collapsed to his knees. "Y-Your Majesty...Liaodong..."

"Good!" The emperor grabbed Xiongying's collar. "Today I strip you of your crown prince title! You're banished to Liaodong!"

Tang He suddenly lunged forward, clutching the emperor's leg. "Your Majesty! The crown prince is young and foolish—"

"Release me!" Zhu Yuanzhang shook off the old general. Yet Xiongying remained upright.

Those eyes—so like Empress Ma's—gazed at him with eerie tranquility.

The emperor's heart lurched violently.

###Chapter 181

Ethan Sullivan's eyes darkened like spilled ink, radiating icy fury.

His slender fingers clenched into fists, knuckles turning white.

Harrison Whitmore glanced through the rearview mirror, his grip tightening on the steering wheel.

He had never seen Mr. Sullivan this enraged before.

Evelyn Laurent's importance to him far exceeded his expectations.

Whoever was behind this would pay dearly.

The four Langley brothers wore equally grim expressions.

Alexander Langley focused on driving while the other three frantically pursued leads.

Anyone who dared harm their little sister would face their wrath.

Evelyn remained blissfully unaware.

She sat in the living room with her parents, savoring the rare warmth of family time.

"Evelyn, look!"

Victoria Langley excitedly raised the camera like a child presenting a treasure.

The projector flickered to life, casting Evelyn's performance onto the wall.

Every spin, every glance—each movement breathtakingly beautiful.

"My daughter is absolutely brilliant!"

Richard Langley couldn't tear his eyes away, pride shining on his face.

Evelyn's ears burned from the praise.

"Mom, this is too much..."

Victoria shook her head firmly. "Nonsense. My daughter is the best!"

She knew Evelyn had never received formal dance training.

Her rapid progress was purely the result of raw talent.

The judges would be stunned if they knew the truth.

Evelyn chuckled helplessly.

She had practiced tai chi daily with village elders since childhood.

To her, dance was simply another form of martial arts.

The thought stirred a pang of nostalgia for her days in White Stone Village.

The projector looped the footage.

Watching her family's rapt attention, warmth blossomed in Evelyn's chest.

Meanwhile...

The covert operatives of the Langley and Sullivan families had mobilized.

They would hunt down the mastermind and make them regret their actions.

——

At Harvard University's gates...

Sophia Lowell hummed a cheerful tune, her steps light.

Nigel Winthrop's compliment had lifted her spirits.

"Your piano skills have improved remarkably."

The words echoed in her mind.

Her lips curved upward involuntarily.

If Nigel approved, it must be true.

Streetlights stretched her shadow long across the pavement.

She didn't notice the pair of eyes watching her intently from the shadows.
###Chapter 182

Sophia Lowell's fingers trembled as she opened Harvard University's forum homepage.

Her pupils constricted at the posts flooding her screen.

"Evelyn Laurent's centennial gala performance—is this beauty even real?"

"From country bumpkin to goddess—Evelyn's glow-up is legendary!"

"What skincare does Evelyn use? Her complexion is flawless!"

With every refresh, new threads about Evelyn sprouted like weeds.

Sophia's nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

She scrolled down desperately.

Finally, on the third page's corner, she spotted a thread mentioning her.

"Sophia Lowell's Piano Trainwreck—Live Footage"

The phone nearly slipped from her grasp when she clicked it.

"Was that Reminiscences of Don Juan or Nightmares of Don Juan?"

"Next time, spare our ears and keep her offstage."

"All showmanship, zero rhythm—how embarrassing."

"That smug smile after butchering the piece? Who gave her the audacity?"

The comments were a unanimous roast.

Sophia's entire body shook.

She hurled her phone against the wall.

"Tasteless peasants!"

Her stiletto crushed a stray pebble underfoot.

She didn't notice the figure approaching from the shadows.

A pale hand shot out from the alleyway.

"Mmph—"

Sophia was yanked into the dim passage.

Acrid cigarette smoke choked her.

"S-Sebastian Royston?"

The man's venomous glare made her blood run cold.

"This was your foolproof plan?"

Sebastian gripped her chin.

"Now the whole campus worships Evelyn. Happy?"
###Chapter 183

Sophia Lowell cowered in the corner, trembling uncontrollably.

Her nails dug deep into her palms as she stared at the approaching Sebastian Royston.

"Mr. Royston..." Her voice quivered. "It really was an accident..."

Sebastian let out a cold laugh, his polished shoes clicking ominously against the floor.

He seized her chin, forcing her to look up.

"Hiding from me?" His voice was icy. "Who gave you the audacity?"

Sophia's pupils constricted, a cold sweat breaking out down her back.

This man was a complete madman.

She regretted it now.

Regretted ever getting close to this monster for personal gain.

Sebastian roughly grabbed her wrist, his grip tight enough to crush bone.

"Move."

A single word, yet it sent Sophia plunging into an icy abyss.

She walked mechanically, her eyes hollow.

Suddenly, Nigel Winthrop's face flashed through her mind.

That faint glimmer of hope was instantly detected by Sebastian.

Thud!

She was slammed against the wall.

His fingers closed around her throat, his eyes burning with twisted possessiveness.

"Thinking of running?" He whispered in her ear, his voice terrifyingly soft. "I'll make you wish you were dead."

Sophia froze, her breath hitching in her chest.

The next afternoon, the investigation results were announced.

The stage collapse was ruled as deliberate sabotage.

The suspect claimed they only wanted to embarrass the school.

But Ethan Sullivan knew better.

"Someone is targeting you," he said, his gaze fixed on Evelyn Laurent.

Evelyn remained composed, her fingers lightly tapping the desk.

"Sophia Lowell." Her tone was decisive.

Though there was no evidence, the answer was obvious.

Ethan frowned. "She might have accomplices."

Evelyn smirked, a sharp glint in her eyes.

"Just petty troublemakers."

She had faced far worse malice.

Such feeble schemes couldn't touch her.

The near-disaster at the gala was proof enough.
###Chapter 184

Ethan Sullivan pressed his slender fingers to his temple, massaging gently. "Her underhanded tactics never cease. You need to stay vigilant."

"If anything happened to you, your parents and brothers would be devastated."

And so would I.

The words lingered on his tongue but remained unspoken.

He maintained an air of indifference in front of Evelyn Laurent, as if merely making casual conversation.

Yet his heart twisted painfully in his chest.

Evelyn had always been fiercely independent.

When trouble arose, her first instinct was to handle it alone—never considering relying on anyone else.

She certainly had the capability.

Ethan wanted to protect her but could only do so from the shadows, careful not to overstep.

At the mention of her family, the ice in Evelyn's gaze softened slightly. "Understood."

She looked up at him, her expression distant. "Anything else?"

Having just left his lecture only to be summoned to his office, her impatience was evident.

Ethan studied her face for a moment before feigning nonchalance. "There's a quantum physics symposium in the neighboring city tomorrow. Interested?"

Evelyn's eyes instantly brightened. "Really?"

The corner of his lips lifted. "Mhm."

His voice unconsciously gentled. "I've been invited and can bring you along."

"Fine."

Her agreement came swiftly—this was her current field of research.

A flicker of resignation crossed Ethan's eyes before melting into amusement. "I'll pick you up at eight tomorrow morning."

Evelyn nodded, her steps noticeably lighter as she turned to leave.

The moment the office door closed, Ethan's smile vanished.

He leaned back in his chair, his gaze darkening.

At least...

He'd finally secured an outing with her.

A rare chance to be alone together.

Hard-won—he couldn't waste it.

Rubbing his temples, Ethan recalled Evelyn's earlier reaction and let out a bitter chuckle.

Without appealing to her interests, he'd never have gotten her to agree. Any other excuse would've earned him that icy "Not interested" before she walked away without a second glance.

Just imagining it made his pulse throb at his temples.

He closed his eyes and exhaled in resignation.

Who could he blame?

He'd been blind not to recognize her initially—and committed that unforgivable mistake.

That Evelyn hadn't demanded to break off their engagement was nothing short of a miracle.

At least the betrothal still tied her to him.

But if she ever resolved to dissolve it...

Ethan's fist clenched violently.

Without that bond, how could he possibly keep this aloof, untouchable girl by his side?

He could already envision it—

Evelyn would sever all ties without hesitation.

No... she probably wouldn't block him.

But she'd never voluntarily look his way again.

The mere thought made his chest constrict.

He crushed the notion ruthlessly.

Never...

He could never let it come to that.
###Chapter 185

The horizon was just beginning to pale with dawn when Ethan Sullivan's car pulled up at the gates of Beverly Hills.

Evelyn Laurent dashed out of the villa with a canvas bag slung over her shoulder, her hair still damp with morning dew.

"You're early," she said, her fingertips chilled by the morning breeze as she opened the car door.

Ethan handed her a cup of steaming hot cocoa. A droplet rolled down the cup and onto her palm.

"The lecture starts at nine," he said, his gaze lingering on her flushed cheeks. "Didn't sleep well last night?"

Evelyn took a sip, the sweetness melting on her tongue.

"Too excited," she admitted, her eyes sparkling. "Professor Klein had me grounded for two weeks."

In the rearview mirror, Harrison Whitmore caught the faint curve of his employer's lips.

As the car left the gated community, Ethan's phone screen lit up briefly.

"The physics research institute in San Francisco just discovered a new quantum entanglement phenomenon," he said casually, scrolling through emails. "The keynote speaker is a Nobel laureate."

Evelyn sat bolt upright, the strap of her bag slipping to her elbow.

"Really?" Her voice trembled. "The lab I think it is?"

Ethan watched her clenched fists, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Yes," he said, reaching over to tuck a stray lock behind her ear. "That's why I came to get you."

Meanwhile, in a suburban apartment, Sebastian Royston glared at the surveillance monitor with a sneer.

The photograph showed Evelyn's profile gilded by morning light, Ethan's fingers in her hair like a glaring intrusion.

"Sophia," he kicked aside an empty liquor bottle.

A rustling came from behind the bedroom door. A woman staggered out, the collar of her nightgown stained with blood.

"Tell me again," Sebastian nudged her chin with the toe of his shoe. "About that lab."

Sophia Lowell's teeth chattered.

The purple bruises around her neck rose and fell with each breath, like some grotesque centipede.

"Evelyn...top physics student..." She broke into violent coughs. "Professor Klein's...favorite..."

Sebastian yanked her hair.

"What else?" He leaned closer to her bleeding ear. "Why is Ethan taking her to San Francisco?"

The window reflected Sophia's twisted face.

Remembering last night's agony—being pressed into broken glass—she suddenly laughed, a shrill, hysterical sound.

"Because..." Blood-flecked spittle sprayed as she whispered in his ear. "She's more important...than you think..."
###Chapter 186

"Evelyn's just some country bumpkin. What's so special about her?"

Sophia clutched the thin blanket around her shoulders, speaking cautiously.

Sebastian's gaze turned icy. His slender fingers gripped her chin. "Go change. You're leaving for San Francisco immediately."

"W-why San Francisco?" The question slipped out before she could stop herself.

A sharp slap echoed through the room.

"Have you forgotten my rules?" Sebastian's voice was laced with venom. "Don't ask questions that don't concern you."

Sophia bit her lip until she tasted blood. Trembling, she nodded and stumbled toward the bathroom.

The mirror reflected a woman with tear-streaked cheeks and bruises covering her body. Last night, Sebastian had tortured her like a madman. Every inch of her skin throbbed with pain.

She muffled her sobs with a towel.

Sebastian held her family's fate in his hands. Her father's medical bills. The survival of the Lowell empire. All depended on his whims.

She wiped her tears, expertly concealing the bruises with makeup. A practiced smile curved her lips.

"Ethan took Evelyn to the physics symposium," Sebastian said abruptly.

Sophia's pulse jumped.

"I heard they're both Professor Klein's prized students..." She kept her eyes down, nails digging into her palms.

Sebastian's expression darkened. "Once you're in San Francisco, find a way to separate Evelyn from the group."

A chill ran down Sophia's spine.

What was this monster planning?

But she could only nod. The consequences of defiance were unthinkable.

Three hours later, outside Culture Plaza.

Ethan opened the car door for Evelyn. "The symposium doesn't start for a while. Shall we grab lunch first?"

"Whatever." Evelyn's reply was indifferent.

Once Harrison tactfully excused himself, Ethan reached for her hand.

Evelyn pulled away with a frown. "Just lead the way."

Her fingertips still tingled from his touch. She pretended not to notice the flicker of hurt in his eyes.
###Chapter 187

Ethan Sullivan lowered his gaze slightly, a flicker of barely concealed frustration flashing in his eyes.

"Apologies. I forgot to mention it beforehand."

His voice was deep, laced with cautious hesitation.

Evelyn Laurent shot him a glance before stepping into the uniquely decorated restaurant.

"Online reviews say this place has exceptional flavors."

Ethan walked ahead, deliberately slowing his pace.

Soft lighting bathed the dining area, each table adorned with elegant candelabras. Evelyn noticed the surrounding patrons were all couples, the air thick with an intimate ambiance.

"Welcome!" A cheerful server approached. "Are you two here for today's Couple's Challenge?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "What challenge?"

She turned to Ethan, her gaze sharp with accusation.

Ethan stiffened visibly. "Challenge?"

The server beamed. "We host daily interactive games for couples. Winners get exclusive discounts."

Evelyn's eyes turned razor-sharp, drilling into Ethan.

"I didn’t know this was a couples' restaurant," Ethan blurted, beads of sweat forming at his temple. "I genuinely picked it for the ratings."

Evelyn studied him for a long moment before scoffing. "You'd better be telling the truth."

Ethan exhaled discreetly, his clenched fists relaxing.

"Today's challenge is especially fun," the server added with a wink. "The gentleman carries the lady through an obstacle course. The last couple standing wins limited-edition matching plushies."

Ethan opened his mouth to decline—

"What are the rules?" Evelyn interjected, suddenly intrigued.

The server gestured toward a miniature track in the center of the restaurant. "Simple. Carry your partner through all obstacles, then hold the pose for three minutes."

Ethan's pulse spiked as he stole a glance at Evelyn’s reaction.

"Only men can carry women?" Evelyn asked, a mischievous glint in her eyes.

The server faltered. "Well... technically, the reverse is allowed..."

Alarm bells rang in Ethan’s mind.

Before he could react, Evelyn rolled up her sleeves with determined relish. "Then I’ll carry you."

Already calculating the discounts and prizes, she missed Ethan’s frozen expression.

"No!" The word burst from him.
###Chapter 188

Ethan stood tall at 6'2", towering over Evelyn's 5'7" frame.

The height difference between them made him frown.

Letting a petite girl carry him?

Absolutely not.

"I'll carry you," Ethan declared firmly.

A bridal carry through an obstacle course for five minutes would be too much for Evelyn's slender arms.

Evelyn tilted her head, studying him. She poked his arm lightly. "You sure?"

His muscles tensed instantly.

No man could tolerate being questioned like that.

"Of course," he stated without hesitation.

Years of fitness training and martial arts had honed his strength.

Ethan rolled up his sleeves, revealing well-defined arms. "Want to test the merchandise?"

A teasing glint flashed in his eyes.

Evelyn hummed and actually squeezed his bicep.

The firmness impressed her.

But she arched a brow. "Your arms are solid, but—"

Before she could finish, Ethan grabbed her hand and pressed it against his abdomen.

"Abs too," he murmured, voice thick with pride.

Evelyn felt every ridge of his sculpted stomach.

Not one to back down, she yanked his hand to her own toned midsection. "I have them too."

Ethan recoiled as if burned.

"Don't be reckless!" His ears turned pink. "A lady shouldn't let just anyone touch her."

He had indeed felt firm muscle—but her boldness sent his pulse racing.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "But you can?"

"That's different." His voice roughened. "Only you get this privilege."

The heat in his gaze could melt steel.

Evelyn laughed softly. "Such a prude?"

She deliberately drawled, "Plenty of people have felt my obliques. They all said they're perfect."

Ethan's expression froze.
###Chapter 189

Ethan Sullivan's expression darkened instantly like spilled ink.

Behind his mask, those deep-set eyes grew shadowed with displeasure.

Evelyn Laurent remained oblivious.

Ethan forcibly suppressed the turbulent emotions churning inside him. "Who else has touched them?" he asked casually.

"My parents and brothers." Evelyn counted on her fingers. "And Lillian Rothschild's group."

The tension in Ethan's shoulders eased almost imperceptibly.

A secret thrill bloomed in his chest.

He was the only man outside her family who'd touched her toned abs.

Unconsciously, his lips curved upward beneath the mask.

The shop assistant watched their interaction with undisguised delight.

"Would you like to attempt the challenge?" she interjected at the perfect moment.

"Yes."

Ethan's deep voice resonated as his burning gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Trust me."

Evelyn looked up into his gentle eyes, then glanced at his tall, athletic frame. "Alright," she murmured softly.

The warmth in Ethan's eyes intensified.

With controlled movements, he lifted Evelyn securely into his arms.

Her slender waist felt impossibly delicate in his grasp.

This was the first time he'd held her while completely sober.

Instinctively, Evelyn wrapped her arms around his neck, her body stiffening.

Through the fabric of his shirt, she could feel the heat of his chest and the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.

Ethan's muscular arms carried her effortlessly through the obstacles.

His pace was measured yet unwavering.

Evelyn buried her face against his chest, the tips of her ears turning pink.

The five-minute bridal carry challenge had begun.

Ethan adjusted his hold, letting her weight settle fully against him.

Despite her delicate appearance, Evelyn's muscles were firm and well-defined.

Her skin felt as smooth as polished jade.

They were so close that each could feel the other's breath.

Evelyn's pulse quickened.

This intimate contact made her both resistant and inexplicably comforted.

Perhaps because... he was Ethan Sullivan.

He always treated her with such gentleness.

Without that arranged marriage contract between them, maybe they could interact more freely.

Ethan's breathing gradually grew heavier.

The physical exertion had raised his body temperature.

The girl in his arms felt light as a feather, yet left him utterly disoriented.
###Chapter 190

Ethan Sullivan gazed down at the woman in his arms, his heartbeat pounding so fiercely it threatened to break free from his chest.

This was the girl he had searched for over a decade.

The treasure he had schemed tirelessly to approach, finally earning the privilege of holding her close.

Though his emotions raged like a storm inside, his arms around Evelyn Laurent remained steady and unshaken.

"Congratulations! You've completed the challenge!"

The clerk's cheerful voice shattered the delicate tension between them.

Evelyn blinked, as if waking from a dream, and immediately signaled for Ethan to set her down.

Reluctantly, he lowered her gently to the ground.

"Next time, I'll carry you."

Evelyn spoke suddenly, her eyes openly studying the flush on his cheeks.

"Look at you, panting like this."

Her tone was matter-of-fact, completely unaware of the implications of her words.

Ethan's throat tightened.

How could he explain that his ragged breathing had nothing to do with exertion?

"Deal," he murmured with a low laugh, warmth flooding his gaze.

He wouldn't mind repeating this challenge a hundred times over.

But he had to pace himself.

If this perceptive girl caught even a hint of his true thoughts, he might lose even the closeness they had now.

The private room was steeped in an intimate ambiance.

The scent of roses lingered in the air.

Yet Evelyn paid no attention to the lavish bouquet of crimson blooms.

"Remember," Ethan poured her a glass of lemon water, "this kind of contact isn't for anyone else."

"Obviously," Evelyn frowned, irritation flashing in her voice. "Do you think I'd let just anyone touch me?"

Her indignant expression made Ethan chuckle.

"You'd better not even consider it," she took a sip of water. "If I didn't know you so well—if I thought you had any ulterior motives..."

Before she could finish, Ethan's grip on his glass tightened.

No ulterior motives?

Every thought in his head was exactly what she accused him of not having.
###Chapter 191

Ethan stared at Evelyn's profile, lost in thought.

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting delicate shadows from her lashes across her cheeks. His Adam's apple bobbed as he forcibly suppressed the turbulent emotions swirling inside him.

She must never know.

If this sharp-witted girl discovered his feelings, she'd probably flip him over her shoulder without hesitation. Worse yet, she might start avoiding him altogether.

Just imagining that scenario made Ethan's chest constrict.

"Ethan," Evelyn suddenly set down her chopsticks, narrowing her eyes. "Are you plotting something shady?"

His fingers twitched imperceptibly, though his expression remained impassive. He dabbed his hands with a napkin before meeting her gaze with cool detachment. "Such as?"

His pulse roared in his ears.

Anticipation and apprehension warred within him as his dark eyes locked onto her.

"Such as..." Evelyn counted on her fingers, "Stealing my research data? Kidnapping me for ransom? Or poisoning my food?"

Ethan nearly choked on his tea.

A low chuckle escaped him, laced with exasperated fondness. "That's all you can imagine?"

"What else?" She glared suspiciously. "Are you targeting my parents now?"

"Never." Ethan's voice turned grave, each word deliberate. "I, Ethan Sullivan, swear I will never harm you."

The intensity in his gaze stunned Evelyn into silence.

A hazy memory surfaced—someone had made her a similarly solemn promise long ago. But like sand slipping through fingers, the recollection eluded her grasp.

"What's wrong?" Ethan's voice tightened.

Evelyn shook her head, studying him thoughtfully. Their eyes met in a silent duel—hers probing, his overflowing with tenderness.

"We..."

A knock interrupted her. A server entered with a cart, soon covering the table with exquisite dishes.

When they were alone again, Ethan asked softly, "What were you going to say?"

"Nothing." Evelyn picked up a piece of sweet-and-sour pork. "Let's eat."

Ethan didn't press further. He finished his meal efficiently before donning gloves to peel shrimp. His slender fingers deftly removed shells, placing translucent meat into her bowl.

Evelyn stared at the shrimp, momentarily stunned.
###Chapter 192

Ethan Sullivan wiped his hands casually. "Might as well do something with my free time."

The corners of his lips lifted as his slender fingers continued playing with the shrimp on the plate.

Those hands that usually found signing contracts tedious were now clumsily peeling shrimp shells. The meat came out mangled and pitiful.

Yet he didn't mind at all. In fact, he seemed to enjoy it more with each attempt.

Harrison Whitmore would've had his eyes pop out if he'd witnessed this.

Since when did the CEO of Sullivan Group do manual labor like this?

He'd always detested shellfish, never even touching them before.

But now.

Those billion-dollar hands were encased in cheap plastic gloves, peeling shrimp for Evelyn Laurent—the very thing he loathed.

And he was loving every second of it.

The plate emptied quickly.

"Want more?" Ethan looked up, warmth glimmering in his eyes.

He knew Evelyn's appetite well. Athletes always burned through calories fast.

Evelyn patted her stomach contentedly. "I'm stuffed."

Every last shrimp had disappeared into her stomach.

"Thanks," she suddenly said.

Ethan arched an eyebrow. "For what?"

"For peeling my shrimp, obviously." Evelyn stated it like common sense.

His expression turned serious. "Don't mention it."

He cherished every moment.

He'd been waiting for this chance.

So Evelyn never needed to thank him.

"Ethan," Evelyn leaned closer suddenly, studying him with suspicion. "Why are you so nice to me?"

His heartbeat stuttered.

That question was dangerous.

The answer hovered on his tongue but stuck in his throat.

Because he loved her.

Enough to do anything for her.

But he couldn't say that yet.

Before he could formulate a response, Evelyn answered her own question. "Afraid I'll back out of breaking off the engagement?"

Ethan froze.

Why did everything circle back to that damned engagement?

His face went rigid.

Evelyn patted his shoulder knowingly. "Relax, I'll let you go the moment you find your true love."

"I'll handle my parents and brothers too. They won't give you any trouble."

Ethan sighed.

How thoughtful of her.

He massaged his temples. "That's not what I—"

"Don't be shy about it." Evelyn waved dismissively. "We'll end the engagement eventually."

"My word is my bond. No take-backs!"

Ethan's chest constricted.

Every harsh word he'd spoken before now pierced his heart like arrows.
###Chapter 193

Ethan Sullivan's fingers unconsciously clenched the fabric over his heart.

Tangled emotions coiled around his chest like vines, making it hard to breathe.

Evelyn Laurent remained oblivious to his distress, leaning in eagerly. "By the way, didn’t you say you found the person you were looking for last time?"

His Adam’s apple bobbed.

"Wrong person." Ethan lowered his lashes. "After so long, mistakes happen."

Evelyn nodded thoughtfully.

She understood that feeling all too well—the Lowell family had searched for her for seventeen years.

Her gaze fell on the small mountain of shrimp shells piled on the table. A pang of sympathy struck her. Sitting back down, she asked softly, "Who is this person you’re looking for?"

Ethan’s pupils constricted sharply.

He hadn’t expected Evelyn to ask.

"She saved me." His voice turned rough. "When I was thirteen, I was kidnapped."

Evelyn’s fork clattered onto her plate.

"She was a victim too, skin and bones." His knuckles whitened. "When the kidnappers hit her, I took the blows for her."

The sunlight streaming through the window suddenly felt too bright.

"We escaped together but got separated along the way." He paused. "All we had time for was to exchange tokens."

Evelyn’s frown deepened.

"Ten years ago?" She looked up abruptly. "I also—"

Her words cut off. Her fingers began trembling uncontrollably, a sheen of sweat forming on her forehead.

Ethan seized her wrist.

"Don’t force yourself." His palm burned against her skin. "No one can hurt you now."

But Evelyn stubbornly shook her head. "No, I need to remember." Her eyes narrowed. "Those bastards won’t get away with it."

Ethan let out a quiet laugh.

This was the Evelyn he knew.

"We’ll be late for the lecture." He deftly changed the subject.

Evelyn immediately perked up. "Let’s go!"

As they stepped out of the restaurant, both froze at the same moment.

Ethan’s gaze turned razor-sharp.

Evelyn followed his line of sight—

Only a few dry leaves tumbled across the empty alley.
###Chapter 194

Ethan Sullivan's gaze turned icy as he stared at the corridor's shadowed corner.

Evelyn Laurent followed his line of sight but saw only emptiness.

"What's wrong?" she whispered.

He withdrew his gaze and took her hand. "Nothing. Let's go."

Yet Evelyn sensed something amiss. That serpentine stare had sent chills down her spine.

As they entered the venue, Sophia Lowell stumbled out from the emergency exit.

Her nails dug into the metal railing like talons.

"Why..." Her burning eyes fixed on the entrance where jealousy festered.

Ethan's tenderness toward Evelyn carved through her heart like a blade.

Her phone vibrated. Sebastian Royston's message made her tremble: [Don't disappoint me]

The taste of blood filled her mouth from biting her lip.

She had to complete Sebastian's task. But what terrified her more was the demon's true intentions for Evelyn.

The lights dimmed inside.

Ethan leaned close, his warm breath brushing Evelyn's ear as he whispered.

Evelyn listened intently, nodding occasionally. Their intimacy stabbed at Sophia's eyes.

Her hand flew to her bare neck.

The priceless diamond necklace had vanished without explanation. Police dismissed the case for lack of evidence, and surveillance showed nothing.

What galled her most was Ethan's indifference.

"Liars...all liars..." Sophia muttered, nails drawing blood from her palms.

They would pay.

Once she controlled Nigel Winthrop, Sebastian would be the first to die.

As for Evelyn and Ethan...

A twisted smile curled Sophia's lips.

When the lights brightened, she smoothed her expression and strode inside with false confidence.
###Chapter 195

Evelyn Laurent and Ethan Sullivan had just taken their seats when the symposium began promptly.

The auditorium was packed with physics enthusiasts who had come specifically for this event. Evelyn listened intently to the expert's lecture, occasionally jotting down novel theoretical concepts in her notebook.

As a special guest, Ethan also delivered a brief speech.

Though it was merely a formality.

The organizers were thrilled. Since taking over Sullivan Group, Ethan hadn't publicly attended a physics lecture in years.

Countless invitations had been politely declined.

Yet today, he made an exception.

Despite his long absence from academia, Ethan's insightful yet accessible explanations left the audience in awe. The moment the lecture ended, he was immediately swarmed by eager attendees.

Having already grasped the material, Evelyn discreetly stepped back and signaled to him, "I'm going out for some air."

Ethan nodded helplessly. "Don't go too far."

He wanted to accompany her, but the crowd made it impossible. Fortunately, he had already instructed Harrison Whitmore to arrange covert protection.

Surveying the enthusiastic throng, Ethan sighed inwardly.

He had anticipated this.

But the chance to spend time alone with Evelyn was rare.

Even just for a day.

It was worth it.

With that thought, he refocused and began answering questions succinctly.

Outside the venue, Evelyn wandered aimlessly.

The lecture had clearly drawn many of Ethan's admirers.

Bored, she meandered without noticing the figure tailing her.

Sophia Lowell hid behind a pillar, her eyes gleaming with excitement.

She had been waiting for an opportunity.

And now Evelyn was alone!

She immediately texted Sebastian Royston.

"Keep following," came the reply. "Update me on her location."

Evelyn pretended to admire the artwork on the walls while subtly checking the reflective glass.

Someone was indeed following her.

The familiar silhouette instantly revealed Sophia's identity.

A faint smirk curled Evelyn's lips.

Sophia had chased her all the way to San Francisco?

She remained unfazed. Her combat skills gave her absolute confidence—and she knew Ethan wouldn’t leave her unprotected.

Deliberately, she turned down a less crowded hallway.

Sophia hurried after her, afraid to lose sight of her target.

Then, at the corner—

An icy hand suddenly seized Sophia's hair, slamming her against the wall. Another hand clamped tightly over her mouth.
###Chapter 196

"Ah!"

Sophia Lowell's pupils contracted violently. Her blood seemed to freeze in her veins.

Evelyn Laurent's coldly beautiful face was inches away, making Sophia feel like she'd been plunged into an icy abyss.

How did she get here?

Sophia's nails dug deep into her palms, but she felt no pain.

The empty alley contained only the two of them. Even their breathing sounded unnaturally loud.

"Following me for three blocks? Looking to die?"

Evelyn's voice dripped with venom as her fingers clamped around Sophia's chin.

Sophia's knees began trembling. Her back was already drenched in sweat.

The memory of being drowned in a sink by Evelyn last time made her throat constrict.

"I—I was just passing by..."

"Liar."

Evelyn tightened her grip, making tears stream down Sophia's face.

Footsteps approached in the distance. A glimmer of hope flashed in Sophia's eyes.

"Just wait until Sebastian Royston gets here!" she cursed viciously in her mind.

Suddenly, Evelyn released her.

She looked down at Sophia with icy disdain. "You think name-dropping Ethan Sullivan scares me?"

Sophia collapsed onto the dirty ground, her dress stained with dust.

She forced herself to look up. "The Sullivan family already arranged his engagement—to the most favored seventh daughter of the Laurent family."

"And..." She deliberately drew out her words. "His heart belongs to someone else. What makes you special?"

Evelyn suddenly smiled.

That smile made Sophia's blood run cold.

"Finished?"

Evelyn stepped on the hem of Sophia's dress and leaned closer. "Now it's my turn."
###Chapter 197

"Do you remember Shadow?" Evelyn's voice was icy. "That stray dog I raised for three years. He gave his life protecting me when I was bullied."

Her gaze remained fixed on Ethan's bleeding fingers, utterly indifferent.

"How many years have we known each other? You watched me get humiliated. You handed my opportunities to the people who hurt me." Her lips curled into a cold smile. "You're worse than a dog."

Ethan stood frozen. Blood dripped onto the floor like withered petals.

He waited. For her final judgment.

"It ends here." Evelyn turned away. "I don't want to hate you anymore. I don't want to love you either. From now on, we're strangers."

Her retreating figure vanished down the hallway without looking back.

Ethan remained motionless. Until the sunset faded. Until his expression twisted from anguish into something dark.

He pulled out his phone.

"The number you have dialed is not in service..."

The automated voice repeated mechanically.

A sinister smile touched his lips as he dialed another number.

"Add another million," his voice was like a whisper from hell. "I'm buying another life."

Evelyn pushed open her front door. Thick cigarette smoke assaulted her senses.

She stiffened, instinctively turning to flee.

"Eve."

That familiar voice rooted her to the spot. When the lights flickered on, she saw Lucian leaning against the foyer.

A wine-red shirt hung loosely on his frame, revealing a glimpse of collarbone. A half-smoked cigarette dangled between his slender fingers, smoke curling around his unreadable gaze.

"How did you get in?" She exhaled in relief.

Lucian stubbed out the cigarette. "Came to pick you up. You didn't call. Thought you stayed over."

Evelyn noticed the ashtray overflowing with cigarette butts.

"Lost my phone," she said, sitting down. "Ethan wanted me to stay for dinner. I refused."

Lucian's fingers tightened imperceptibly.

She saw his Adam's apple bob, his jawline tensing.

"You knew I was there?" she asked softly. "Why didn't you come for me?"

She remembered how he'd limped into the hospital on his injured leg, swearing to protect her.
###Chapter 198

To Sebastian Royston, Sophia Lowell wasn’t even worth a second glance.

She had been thrown out as bait to lure Evelyn Laurent, but he barely spared her a look.

A dozen thugs surrounded Evelyn, yet she didn’t even flinch.

"Is this all you’ve got?" She scanned the group with a mocking smirk.

Sophia kept her head down, too afraid to speak.

She secretly wished Sebastian had sent more men.

Maybe then Evelyn would be beaten to her knees, begging for mercy!

Surely Ethan Sullivan hadn’t assigned bodyguards to this woman?

There was no way she could take on a dozen burly men alone.

"Be a good girl and surrender. It’ll hurt less."

"Let us show you a good time."

Filthy words spilled from the thugs’ mouths. One even whistled at her.

Their lecherous stares made Evelyn’s stomach churn.

It reminded her of the way street punks used to leer at her.

What had happened to those punks in the end?

They’d started running at the sight of her, terrified of getting another beating.

Back then, they’d all called her Sister Evelyn.

She rolled her wrists, lips curling into a cold smile.

It had been too long since she’d stretched her limbs.

Today was the perfect opportunity.

Without hesitation, she lunged at the one with the most disgusting gaze.

A sharp uppercut cracked against his jaw.

The sickening crunch of bone echoed through the air.

The man flew three meters back before collapsing, unconscious.

Silence fell over the scene.

One punch had taken down a grown man?

Sophia’s legs trembled.

Had Evelyn been holding back when she’d hit them before?

What kind of monster was this woman?

She watched in horror as Evelyn moved through the crowd like a panther.

The thugs might as well have been made of paper.

In under five minutes, bodies littered the ground.

Sebastian stood frozen in shock.

He turned to flee but found his path blocked by three men in black.

Harrison Whitmore leisurely removed his sunglasses.

"Where are you off to, Mr. Royston?"

Two bodyguards seized Sebastian by the arms.

"Harrison! You’ve got a death wish?" He struggled violently.

Harrison scoffed, patting his cheek with a smirk.

"That’s my line."
###Chapter 199

Harrison Whitmore looked down at Sebastian Royston with cold disdain.

Sebastian was pinned to the ground by two black-suited bodyguards, trembling like a chicken awaiting slaughter.

"Harrison!" Sebastian snarled, struggling against their grip.

Harrison casually crouched beside him, taking his time.

"Third Young Master Royston," he drawled. "You're so weak, even my boss's Tibetan mastiff could take you down."

Sebastian's face paled, his lips quivering with rage.

After their failed coup, they'd been exiled to Oklahoma. This time, they'd returned under the guise of medical treatment—only to be caught red-handed.

"You think capturing me changes anything?" Sebastian sneered. "The old man despises fratricide."

Harrison suddenly grinned.

The smile sent chills down Sebastian's spine.

"Who said we're touching you?" Harrison patted his cheek mockingly. "Young Master Nathaniel Langley is short on lab rats these days."

Sebastian's pupils contracted in horror.

Nathaniel—that deranged medical prodigy?!

"You're lying!" His voice shook. "What does Evelyn Laurent have to do with the Langley family?"

Harrison leaned in, whispering in his ear.

"The seventh Langley heiress. Figure it out."

Sebastian froze.

Suddenly, Evelyn's enigmatic smile made sense—it was the same as the Langleys'.

"No... impossible—"

Before he could finish, his eyes rolled back, and he collapsed unconscious.

Harrison nudged him with disgust.

"That's it? He fainted?"

He waved at the bodyguards.

"Wrap him up and deliver him to the Langley labs. Tie a bow on him."

The guards dragged Sebastian away like a lifeless sack.

Harrison pulled out his phone and texted Ethan Sullivan:

[Done. Handed over to Nathaniel.]
###Chapter 200

Two bodyguards swiftly escorted Sebastian Royston away from the scene.

Harrison Whitmore arrived with the remaining team and gasped at the sight of bodies strewn across the ground.

His legs nearly gave out beneath him.

The gruesome scene reminded him of the first time he'd witnessed Evelyn Laurent's terrifying prowess.

"What? Thought I killed them?" Evelyn shot him a disdainful glance.

Harrison finally noticed the unconscious men were still breathing and exhaled in relief.

"You flatter me, Miss Laurent." He wiped the cold sweat from his brow.

Ever since seeing her bend steel pipes bare-handed, he'd regarded this young heiress with deep reverence.

"Did you catch the mastermind?" Evelyn flexed her wrists.

Before they'd left, Ethan Sullivan had warned her about the ambush and asked if she was afraid.

Afraid?

Since when did Evelyn Laurent fear a fight?

Aside from alcohol and enclosed spaces, very few things in this world could unsettle her.

"He's already been delivered to Mr. Sullivan," Harrison replied respectfully.

Evelyn's gaze drifted toward Sophia Lowell, who cowered in the corner. "You handle these men," she said lazily.

She stretched, savoring the pleasant ache in her muscles.

It had been too long since she'd enjoyed such a satisfying brawl.

Harrison immediately directed the bodyguards to douse the unconscious assailants with water.

Moans and pleas for mercy soon filled the air.

"Take them all away," Harrison ordered coldly.

He didn't even glance at Sophia as he passed her.

Miss Laurent had made it clear she wanted to deal with the girl personally.

Only after everyone had left did Sophia stagger to her feet, trembling.

Horror filled her eyes.

How could Evelyn fight like that?

Even more shocking was Harrison's deferential attitude toward her.

"They caught the mastermind?" A sudden thought made Sophia's eyes gleam with manic delight.

If Sebastian Royston had been captured...

She might finally be free of that monster!

The idea made her burst into hysterical laughter.
###Chapter 201

Sophia Lowell dialed Sebastian Royston's number.

The line rang with an automated voicemail prompt.

She stubbornly redialed several times.

Still no answer.

Sophia strode briskly toward the parking lot.

Sebastian's car remained parked in its spot.

She circled the vehicle once.

Her triumphant smirk reflected in the tinted windows.

"Divine intervention," she murmured.

Sophia yanked the door open and slid inside.

Her fingers flew through the compartments, scavenging valuables.

Wallet. Watch. Limited-edition lighter.

All disappeared into her handbag.

"Car service? Yes, Culture Plaza underground parking."

Hanging up, she hummed a tune and settled into the driver's seat.

Meanwhile...

Evelyn Laurent browsed through Culture Plaza.

Her phone vibrated abruptly.

"Yes?"

"Everything alright?"

Ethan Sullivan's baritone voice carried through the receiver.

Evelyn's lips curved. "Never better."

She nudged a pebble with her shoe.

"Unlike those fools who picked the wrong fight."

A low chuckle resonated from the other end.

"Your location? I'll come get you."

"Unnecessary."

Evelyn glanced at the directory sign.

"Nearly at the venue."

After ending the call, Ethan exited the event space.

His gaze instantly found the familiar silhouette.

Sunlight danced across her hair as she approached with effortless grace.

Ethan's expression softened involuntarily.

"How was the warmup?"

His voice gentled.

Evelyn scoffed. "Pathetic."

She flexed her wrist.

"Didn't even break a sweat."

Ethan studied her restless energy.

A foreboding pricked his instincts.

Right on cue—

"Care for a real match?"

Her eyes sparkled with challenge.

Ethan exhaled in defeat.

"I surrender."

Evelyn frowned. "I'll go easy on you."

Ethan swallowed his retort.

"Let me take you somewhere."

He deftly redirected.

"You'll love it."

Her attention hooked instantly.

"Promise?"

"No deception."

Watching her animated expression, warmth bloomed in his chest.

This version of Evelyn—

Vibrant. Alive.

Infinitely more captivating than the ice queen she'd once been.

The black sedan glided toward downtown.

"What's Monarch Lounge?"

Evelyn tilted her head.

Ethan's lips curved mysteriously.

"All in due time."

From the driver's seat, Harrison Whitmore observed the pair through the rearview mirror.

He suppressed a silent whistle.
###Chapter 202

Harrison stole a glance through the rearview mirror.

Ethan gazed intently out the window, his chiseled profile illuminated by streetlights. Evelyn scrolled through her phone, an invisible wall between them.

Harrison sighed inwardly.

Just days ago on the yacht, they'd been so close. How had they reverted to this awkward distance?

The car entered downtown and stopped before Monarch Lounge.

"A bar?" Evelyn frowned, fingers tightening around her purse strap. Memories of her last drunken mishap flooded back.

Ethan stepped out with a faint smile. "Not just a bar."

He extended his hand, long fingers stark against the night.

After a hesitation, she placed her palm in his.

At their touch, triumph flickered in Ethan's eyes. He guided her through the pulsing dance floor without breaking contact.

Evelyn gasped at the hidden door ahead. Ethan input the code effortlessly. The metal panel slid open to reveal an expansive shooting range.

"Ever tried?" He shrugged off his suit jacket.

Her gaze locked on the weapon display. She shook her head, but curiosity shone through.

"There's also archery." He opened another door. His intel had been correct—Evelyn adored such sports.

She immediately gravitated toward the compound bow.

"This one..." She tested the drawstring. Its resistance made Ethan's brows lift.

"Wrong stance."

He positioned himself behind her, hands covering hers. His warm breath grazed her ear. "Relax your shoulders."

A blush crept up her earlobes.

The first arrow struck dead center.

"Bullseye?" She turned, her nose nearly brushing his jaw.

Ethan chuckled. "Natural talent."

"Obviously." She tilted her chin, competitive fire igniting.

For thirty minutes, arrows whistled through the air.

"Missed again!" She stomped in frustration.

Ethan watched her pouting profile with undisguised fondness. He nocked another arrow—perfect ten.

"Ethan!" She glared. "You've practiced secretly, haven't you?"

"For years." His gaze held hidden depths. "Waiting for someone."

Her phone rang before she could inquire. Seeing the caller ID, her expression shifted. "I need to take this."

Ethan's eyes darkened as she hurried away.

Harrison appeared silently at the doorway. "Sir, we've confirmed. Miss Laurent has been meeting with the Zhou Group."

Ethan stroked the bowstring, voice icy. "The Zhous? How interesting."
###Chapter 203

Evelyn drew back the string of her compound bow, her gaze locked on the distant bullseye.

The second arrow sliced through the air.

The third followed in quick succession.

Ethan stood nearby, his eyes never leaving her. In just over ten minutes, she had gone from awkward beginner to effortless mastery.

His gaze darkened.

This girl never ceased to amaze him. Studies, games, archery—if she set her mind to it, she mastered it.

Evelyn practiced for another half hour, each arrow landing in the eight or nine rings.

Her progress was astonishingly fast.

She was having too much fun to feel fatigue. Even as the target moved farther away, her arrows still struck true.

Most impressive was her arm strength. The heaviest bow felt weightless in her hands, the string drawn back without strain.

Ethan studied her stance, thoughtful.

They’d need to expand the range soon.

He pulled out his phone and texted his assistant: Begin preparations for an outdoor shooting range immediately.

Evelyn didn’t notice. She set down the bow, her attention caught by the firearms on the other side.

"How do you use this?"

She eagerly picked up a pistol, testing its weight.

Every weapon here was legally registered, loaded with safety rounds.

"Let me show you."

He stepped behind her, guiding her hands through loading, chambering, and aiming.

Evelyn learned frighteningly fast.

Three hours later, fatigue finally crept in, but her eyes still sparkled with excitement.

"I should ask my brother to build something like this," she mused.

Ethan stilled.

"Why?" he asked softly.

"I can’t keep bothering you." She said it like it was obvious.

He set down his gun and met her gaze. "You’re always welcome here. Anytime."

The sincerity in his voice sent a tremor through her.

"Well... alright." She relented, then added, "But the space is a bit cramped."

A faint smile touched his lips as he lifted his phone. "Already working on an outdoor range. You’ll see it soon."

In truth, he’d already ordered his assistant to expedite the project.

"Really?" Her eyes lit up.

Ethan’s efficiency never failed to impress her.
###Chapter 204

Ethan Sullivan's slender fingers tapped lightly on the desk.

He gazed at the darkening sky outside the window, a faint smile playing at the corners of his lips.

For Evelyn Laurent's birthday gift, he already had the perfect idea.

Eighteen.

That special age.

The entire Lowell family was quietly preparing for the celebration.

He knew she disliked extravagance.

So he would arrange an intimate gathering.

Only inviting those she truly wanted to see.

A shadow flickered in Ethan's eyes.

No matter what, he would be there.

"Growl—"

A soft sound broke the silence.

Ethan turned, his gaze settling on Evelyn. "Hungry?"

Without waiting for her reply, he stood. "Let's go eat."

Evelyn nodded and followed him.

Night deepened.

She studied Ethan's tall, straight-backed figure, lost in thought.

Three hours of intense training.

Yet he hadn't even broken a sweat.

His physical endurance surprised her.

But last time...

Evelyn frowned slightly.

After that obstacle run, he'd been panting heavily.

Now that she thought about it, something felt off.

She mentally noted: Ethan Sullivan—unstable stamina.

Still...

Being with him was comfortable.

Like spending time with her brothers.

Ethan remained oblivious to her thoughts.

"What would you like?" he asked softly.

When she hesitated, he decided for her. "Let's get barbecue."

It was one of the Lowell Group's restaurants.

Victoria Langley's favorite.

Evelyn had been there a few times.

But this was her first visit alone with Ethan.

In the private room, he handed her the menu.

His eyes never left her face.

Evelyn looked up after ordering, meeting his deep gaze.

"Did you want to add something?" She pushed the menu toward him. "Why keep staring at me?"

Ethan hesitated.

Finally, he silently added two more dishes.

"I'll grab some sides."

As Evelyn stood, her stomach growled again.

Post-workout hunger was relentless.

The aroma of grilled meat made her quicken her steps.

Ethan watched her leave, warmth softening his expression.

Evelyn browsed the buffet area with a tray.

She paused suddenly.

Picking up a small cake, she took a bite.

After a moment's thought, she grabbed another.

Turning back, she couldn't suppress a small smile.
###Chapter 205

Ethan Sullivan's slender fingers tapped lightly on the menu as he selected Evelyn Laurent's favorite dishes.

He lounged lazily against the leather sofa, his gaze trailing her slender figure.

Evelyn circled the buffet area before returning swiftly with a plate.

"That was fast," Ethan arched a brow.

She slid the plate toward him. Two delicate cakes exuded a sweet, rich aroma.

"Something to tide you over." She turned away again.

Ethan stared at the desserts, his lips curving unconsciously.

He carefully sliced a small piece with his fork. The cream melted on his tongue, sweetness flooding his chest.

Being remembered like this—it felt good.

When Evelyn returned, she carried two glasses of fresh juice.

A figure suddenly darted from the hallway corner. She barely had time to react before cold juice splashed onto the stranger.

"Are you blind?" A shrill voice pierced the air.

Evelyn looked up into Margaret Hill's pinched face. The woman's expression shifted from fury to terror, as if she'd seen a ghost.

"Mom!" Sophia Lowell peeked out from the private room, her face paling at the sight of Evelyn.

"Why stop now?" Evelyn smirked coldly.

Margaret forced a grimace uglier than a sob. "M-my mistake..."

Evelyn had no patience for them. She walked away without another word.

This restaurant belonged to the Lowell empire. Every cent Margaret and Sophia spent here would flow back into the family coffers.

Let them keep being fools with their money.
###Chapter 206

She carried two glasses of freshly squeezed juice as she walked away.

Margaret Hill glared venomously at Evelyn Laurent's retreating figure but didn't dare follow. Instead, she dragged Sophia Lowell back into the private dining room.

The two women frantically wiped juice stains from their clothes.

"How did that bitch end up here?"

Margaret spat through gritted teeth.

Moments ago, she hadn't dared to breathe too loudly in Evelyn's presence. Now she raged like a rabid dog.

Sophia shrank back slightly. "Mom, she has powerful backing now... we can't afford to cross her."

Her fingers trembled as she recalled Evelyn single-handedly taking down a dozen burly men.

The memory of that devastating punch to a man's temple still made her blood run cold.

Margaret crumpled a napkin in frustration. "Didn't you say you knew the Royston heir? When are you introducing me?"

Sophia's neck stiffened instantly.

Her hand flew to the bruise hidden beneath her collarbone.

Sebastian Royston hadn't contacted her in three days.

The company was in chaos—shareholders dumping stocks, the CFO absconding with funds...

Yet she couldn't go to the police.

Those shady financial records wouldn't survive scrutiny.

"We... broke up," Sophia lied, twisting the hem of her blouse. "He got bored and dumped me."

At least she'd siphoned off company assets beforehand.

The legal liability fell on Vincent Lowell, currently comatose in the ICU.

Margaret's eyes reddened. "Your father and brother are still hospitalized... and we can't even find who did this..."

Sophia stared at the fruit pulp floating in her juice.

She knew exactly who was responsible.

That invincible figure from the fighting ring was now laughing carefree in the next room.

Yet she lacked even the courage to file a police report.

"Once Sebastian tires of her..." Sophia studied her distorted reflection in the glass. "Let's see how long she keeps that arrogance."

A hairline crack suddenly split the crystal tumbler.
###Chapter 207

Margaret Hill and Sophia Lowell barely caused a ripple in Evelyn Laurent's heart.

To her, they were nothing but insignificant minnows.

Their instinctive fear when they saw her pleased Evelyn.

She would make sure that fear lasted.

Until the very end of their lives.

Evelyn returned to the private dining room with a glass of juice and placed it gently before Ethan Sullivan.

He looked up, warmth shimmering in his eyes. "Thank you."

"Since when do we stand on ceremony?" Evelyn arched a brow. "I told you not to thank me. So don't."

Her tone was casual, as if stating the obvious.

Ethan's smile deepened as he nodded solemnly.

His Evelyn was always so generous.

She took her seat effortlessly and began eating the food she'd gathered.

She was genuinely hungry.

Ethan stole glances at her between bites.

Evelyn's beauty was flawless from every angle.

She had inherited all the best features from Victoria Langley and Richard Langley.

Those large, expressive eyes. That perfectly sculpted nose.

Her facial proportions were exquisite, her skin like fresh snow.

Even after a decade of rural hardship and manual labor, her complexion remained radiant.

No one would ever believe she'd once been a country girl.

Her hands were soft and smooth, barely a callus in sight.

She carried herself like the pampered heiress she was meant to be.

Waiters arrived with their ordered dishes.

Ethan expertly began grilling the meat.

The first perfectly cooked slice always went to Evelyn.

His movements were graceful and unhurried.

Evelyn didn't lift a finger the entire meal.

Every time she tried to help, Ethan refused.

He'd finally found a chance to care for her—why would he give that up?

A steady stream of grilled meat found its way to Evelyn's plate.

She had a healthy appetite, so Ethan alternated between cooking and eating.

Only after she was satisfied did he focus entirely on serving her.

He even refilled her juice twice.

Thankfully, no acquaintances witnessed this.

They would've been shocked speechless.

Since when did Ethan Sullivan dote on anyone?

Of course, his tenderness was reserved for Evelyn alone.

He wanted to give her the entire world.

"Ah—"

Evelyn drained her glass in one go and exhaled in satisfaction.

Ethan watched her with amusement. "Full?"

"Mhm." She nodded.

She'd eaten more than usual today.

The day's exertions had left her ravenous.

Ethan handed her a napkin. "Shall I take you home?"

"Sure."

They both lived in Beverly Hills—it was on his way.

As they stepped out of the private room, they nearly collided with Margaret and Sophia, who were just leaving.

Ethan's gaze turned icy in an instant.
###Chapter 208

Evelyn Laurent wiped her lips contentedly.

The barbecue meal had lifted her spirits, making everything around her seem brighter.

Ethan Sullivan subtly observed her expression, relieved to see their earlier encounter hadn't dampened her mood. His tense shoulders finally relaxed.

At the restaurant entrance, Margaret Hill and Sophia Lowell stood frozen like frightened quails, shrinking back several steps.

Only when Evelyn and Ethan disappeared around the corner did Sophia dare to lift her head.

Her nails dug deep into her palms as she glared at the direction Evelyn had gone.

Why?

Why did Evelyn deserve such preferential treatment from Ethan?

That necklace should have been hers. Yet Ethan hadn't even glanced her way, showering Evelyn with endless care instead.

Sophia's chest heaved violently.

She needed to get close to Nigel Winthrop—fast.

This was her last chance to turn the tables.

"Sophia..." Margaret's voice trembled. "Was that really the Sullivan family's—"

"Yes." Sophia cut her off, dragging her mother away.

Once outside, Margaret immediately erupted. "That little bitch! First the Lowells, now the Sullivans? Shameless!"

"Ethan will tire of her eventually," Sophia said coldly, a dark glint flashing in her eyes.

From the hospital corridor, Brandon Lowell's furious roar echoed: "Where the hell have you been? Trying to starve me to death?"

Margaret scurried over. "Don't worry, son. I brought you food."

Brandon snatched the takeout container, his face thunderous.

Since the accident, his temper had grown increasingly volatile—smashing objects and cursing at the slightest provocation.

Standing at the ward door, Sophia surveyed the fractured remnants of her family, a cold smirk twisting her lips.

She wouldn't repeat past mistakes.

This time, she would crush Evelyn beneath her heel.
###Chapter 209

Brandon Lowell lay emaciated on the hospital bed, his cheekbones protruding sharply, his eyes sunken deep into their sockets.

He glared at the food container Margaret Hill offered him, then suddenly lashed out in fury, knocking it away. "Who wants your leftovers?"

The container hit the floor with a dull thud.

Brandon's eyes darkened, his voice hoarse. "You're mocking me now that I'm useless, aren't you?"

Margaret frantically knelt to gather the scattered food. "Brandon, I made this specially for you—"

The grilled meat inside still steamed faintly.

Brandon's gaze fixed on the golden-brown slice, his Adam's apple bobbing. Yet he sneered. "Father's still in a coma, and you have time to feast?"

Margaret paled, her fingers twisting the hem of her blouse.

"Feed me," Brandon suddenly commanded.

Relieved, Margaret quickly picked up the meat and brought it to his lips.

Sophia Lowell stood by the window, watching coldly.

Since his hospitalization, Brandon had grown increasingly volatile. Margaret's indulgence had reached appalling levels.

In the neighboring bed, Vincent Lowell remained on life support. The medical bills piled up like snowflakes.

Sophia stared at her father's pallid face, a shadow flickering in her eyes.

The doctors had said Vincent's chances of waking were slim.

That meant a lifetime of carrying this burden.

She refused.

Why should she sacrifice her life for a father who had never raised her?

In this family, she had always been disposable.

If not for the accident, Lowell Group would never have fallen into her hands.

"Why isn't this spicy?"

Brandon's roar shattered her thoughts.

His face twisted as he glared at Margaret. "Are you doing this on purpose?"

Margaret stammered an apology. "I'll add some right away—"

"Enough!" Sophia finally snapped.

Brandon whipped his head toward her, venom flashing in his eyes. "Since when does the worthless spare dare interfere?"

The insult cut like a knife.

She remembered when Brandon had once sweetly called her "sister."

Now, only naked hatred remained.
###Chapter 210

Sophia Lowell's fingers dug deep into her palms, her nails nearly piercing the flesh.

A storm of darkness churned in her eyes.

Thankfully, she had prepared in advance and transferred all her assets.

She wouldn't spend another cent on this father-son pair's medical bills!

"Brandon, calm down. The doctor said you shouldn't get agitated." Margaret Hill quickly soothed her son before shooting Sophia a reproachful glare. "Sophia, can't you be more understanding? Your brother isn't stable right now."

Brandon scoffed, his face full of disdain. "Hear that? Even Mom agrees with me. Who are you to lecture me?"

He had been a spoiled brat since childhood.

His parents indulged his every whim, molding him into an arrogant, entitled man.

His previous politeness toward Sophia had only been because she was useful.

Now that the mask was off, he couldn't even be bothered to pretend.

Sophia's face darkened, her jaw clenched tight.

"W-what's... all this noise...?"

A weak voice suddenly came from the side.

All three turned their heads.

On the neighboring hospital bed, Vincent Lowell slowly opened his eyes.

His face was deathly pale, his lips cracked, his brow furrowed in pain.

"Darling!"
"Dad!"

Margaret and Sophia immediately rushed to his side.

Brandon also schooled his expression, though his gaze remained fixed on his father.

"Where... am I?"

Vincent's voice was hoarse, his eyes dazed.

Margaret hurriedly moistened his lips with a damp cotton swab, tears spilling over. "The hospital. You've been in a coma for a month..."

She had feared he would never wake up.

Vincent's eyes widened in shock.

A month?

Sophia had already called for the attending physician.

After a thorough examination, the doctor smiled in relief. "The patient's awakening is a good sign. Focus on rehabilitation now."

Only then did Margaret relax, clutching her husband's hand. "Darling, do you remember who did this to you?"

"Ah! My leg! My leg!"

Vincent suddenly screamed.

His entire body trembled violently, as if reliving the agony of his shattered bones.

Cold sweat drenched his hospital gown in seconds.

"Doctor! Get the doctor!" Margaret panicked.

The physician rushed back, examined him, and shook his head. "His leg is healing well. This is phantom pain."

"There's no specific treatment. He'll have to overcome it himself."

Only after the doctor left did Vincent's pain gradually subside.

He strained to recall that day's events, but his memory remained blank.

Sophia leaned in close, her voice low. "Dad, think carefully. If we find the culprit, we'll make sure he pays!"

Vincent's temples throbbed, his brow furrowed in frustration.

Finally, he closed his eyes in defeat. "I... truly can't remember."
###Chapter 211

Vincent Lowell's head throbbed with excruciating pain.

He strained to recall what happened before he lost consciousness, but only fragmented flashes surfaced.

A burlap sack had been thrown over his head.

A sharp blow to the back of his skull.

Then, endless darkness.

"Who was it...?" he muttered, fingers tightening around the hospital sheets. The answer mattered more than anything, yet his memory had been erased like pencil marks under an eraser.

Worse, he realized his legs had gone numb.

The doctor said the head trauma might leave lasting damage.

"Dad, you're awake?" Sophia Lowell's voice pulled him back to reality.

Vincent jerked upright, ignoring the pain. "What about the company?"

The air in the room turned to ice.

Margaret nudged their daughter. "Tell him."

Sophia bit her lip, her grip whitening around her purse.

"Speak!" Vincent barked.

"Lowell Group..." She inhaled sharply. "Is about to go bankrupt."

"What?!"

Three gasps rang out simultaneously. Margaret's glass slipped from her fingers and shattered on the floor.

Vincent's face drained of color. The heart monitor screeched an alarm.

When medical staff rushed in, they found the patient heaving, his glare locked onto his daughter in the corner.

"The patient needs rest!" the doctor snapped at the family.

Sophia hid behind the curtains but still felt the daggers in her father's stare—as if he wanted to carve her to pieces.

One month.

Just one month, and the empire he'd built over decades had crumbled to dust.

"What happened?" Margaret's voice shook. "You said professionals were handling it!"

Sophia exploded. "What could I do?! The shareholders panicked and dumped their stocks! Sebastian Royston vanished overnight!"

Tears spilled down her cheeks.

"Those contract traps were impossible to decipher! Selling assets was the only option!"

Her hysterical sobs filled the room.

Vincent shut his eyes, chest heaving. He remembered the sleepless nights reviewing reports, the humiliations endured to build his empire...

"How much is left?" His voice was gravel.

Every word sounded wrenched from his teeth.
###Chapter 212

Sophia Lowell bit her lip. "About... a hundred million."

Vincent Lowell's eyes widened in shock.

His chest heaved violently. His face turned deathly pale. He collapsed backward like a felled tree.

The heart monitor screeched an alarm.

Margaret Hill threw herself at the hospital bed. "Vincent!"

Doctors and nurses rushed in. They wheeled the barely conscious Vincent back to the operating room.

Sophia stood frozen, her eyes red-rimmed. "Mom, I did everything I could..."

Her fists clenched. Her voice cracked. "They'd already transferred most of the assets. Recovering this much was..."

Margaret whirled around, eyes blazing with betrayal. "You swore the company was stable! Why lie to me?"

"You were taking care of Dad and Brandon! I didn't want to burden you!" Sophia lifted her chin defiantly.

A wave of bitterness rose in her chest.

Did they think she wanted the Lowell empire to crumble?

If only her father hadn't crossed the wrong people...

——

Beverly Hills.

A black Maybach glided to a stop before the Lowell mansion.

Ethan Sullivan circled to the passenger side. He opened the door for Evelyn Laurent.

"Evelyn, you're late," Victoria Langley called from the doorway.

Evelyn smoothed her dress. "Ethan took me to an art exhibition."

Standing beside her, Ethan smiled warmly. "Don't worry, Mrs. Langley. I kept her safe."

Victoria's eyes sparkled. "Come inside! Your brother Nathaniel just returned from abroad."

She called up the staircase, "Nathaniel! Your sister's home!"

Hurried footsteps echoed from above.

Four tall figures descended in succession.

Alexander Langley stepped forward first. He subtly pulled Evelyn to his side. "Did you have fun today?"

Evelyn nodded, recounting the day's adventures.

Ethan settled into an armchair. His gaze never left her.

The four brothers exchanged glances.

They used to think the Sullivan heir was decent enough.

Now he just looked like a nuisance.

Their precious baby sister...

How dare this man even look at her?
###Chapter 213

Ethan Sullivan sensed four pairs of cold eyes glancing his way at intervals.

He lifted his teacup with practiced ease, a faint smile playing on his lips.

As Evelyn Laurent's fiancé, he prided himself on playing the role impeccably.

He took her on outings. He made her laugh.

The entire Langley family had accepted him.

As long as no one discovered he'd once tried to break off the engagement...

His gaze darkened.

That agreement needed to be found and destroyed—quickly.

His own copy was already disposed of.

But Evelyn's remained missing.

If discovered, the consequences would be catastrophic.

Yet haste would only backfire.

Knowing Evelyn, she'd hidden something that important with extreme care.

Half an hour later, Ethan rose to leave.

Victoria Langley escorted him to the door, watching as he walked toward the neighboring mansion.

"Ethan's a good boy," Victoria murmured, turning back inside. "At least he lives close. Evelyn can choose whichever home she prefers."

Evelyn's fingers twitched briefly before stilling.

Alexander Langley frowned. "Marriage isn't a game."

He turned to his sister. "Forced fruit is never sweet."

Victoria's eyes turned sharp. "Alexander, where's your girlfriend?"

Alexander stiffened. "The company's been busy—"

"Busy?" Victoria scoffed. "Is Reginald Quincy not busy? He's already holding his grandson!"

Alexander pressed his lips together.

The formidable CEO now sat as quiet as a mouse.

Sebastian and his brothers stifled laughter.

Victoria's wrath immediately shifted. "Sebastian, wipe that stupid grin off your face!"

Sebastian's smile froze.

"With so many lady friends, why haven't you brought one home?" Victoria snapped.

Sebastian gave a strained chuckle. "I'm searching for true love—"

"You fall for every skirt that passes!" Victoria grabbed the feather duster. "Share half your harem with your brother!"

Finally, her glare landed on Nathaniel.

"Nathaniel, are there any girls in your lab?"

Nathaniel adjusted his glasses. "Yes."

His expression turned earnest. "Frequent contact."

Victoria trembled with rage. "For dissections?"

Nathaniel nodded solemnly. "Correct."

The medical doctoral candidate saw absolutely nothing wrong with this.
###Chapter 214

Victoria Langley's feather duster sliced through the air with a sharp whistle.

A crisp smack echoed through the room.

Nathaniel Langley's thigh took the full brunt of the strike.

"Mom!" He sucked in a sharp breath, instinctively shrinking closer to Sebastian.

"I was just telling the truth!"

Victoria scoffed. "Brutal honesty? Show me what that looks like, then."

The living room atmosphere turned glacial.

Four brothers sat rigidly side by side on the couch, barely daring to breathe.

Dominic opened his mouth to defend himself—

"Don't even start." Victoria cut him off with a glare. "Think being a lawyer makes you special?"

The feather duster rose again.

Dominic immediately straightened his spine. "I was wrong!"

Across from them, Evelyn Laurent bit back a laugh.

Who would've thought the formidable Lowell brothers could be tamed by a simple feather duster?

Especially Alexander.

The usually cold, commanding business tycoon now sat with his head bowed, meek as a quail.

"Listen up." Victoria pointed the duster at her sons. "I approve of Ethan. If any of you dare make things difficult for him—"

She paused deliberately.

Four heads shook in unison. "We wouldn't dare."

Evelyn's smile froze.

Damn it.

Mom had clearly decided Ethan Sullivan was her future son-in-law.

But marriage was the last thing on Evelyn's mind.

Breaking off the engagement would require... careful planning.

At the very least—

She needed to wait until her mother put that feather duster away.
###Chapter 215

Victoria Langley finished scolding each of her four sons before finally allowing them to leave with satisfaction.

She turned and took Evelyn Laurent's hand, her gaze tender yet firm. "Ethan is a good boy, but if he ever dares to mistreat you, I'll be the first to make him regret it."

"The jewel of the Langley family isn't someone anyone can bully."

Though the Sullivans had honored the engagement all these years and the two families remained close, the thought of her daughter marrying still twisted Victoria's heart.

At least the Sullivans lived in Beverly Hills. She could visit Evelyn whenever she wished.

The match was well-suited, and the engagement had lasted nearly eighteen years. The Sullivans' sincerity was undeniable.

Evelyn met her mother's worried eyes and reassured her softly, "Don't worry, Mom."

A sharp glint flickered in her gaze.

If Ethan Sullivan ever dared to cross her...

She had a hundred ways to make him pay.

She kept these thoughts to herself, nodding obediently instead.

Victoria lovingly stroked her daughter's hair. "Go rest now."

Unable to resist, she pulled Evelyn into one last embrace before reluctantly retiring to her room.

Late at night, Evelyn tossed and turned in bed.

Was she really going to marry Ethan Sullivan?

She knew nothing about love—had only understood familial affection after returning to the Langley family.

Romance?

What even was that?

She didn't need it.

But if an arranged marriage was inevitable...

Ethan was far more tolerable than a stranger.

The realization made her roll over in irritation.

She'd have to ask her mother about it tomorrow.

Forcing her eyes shut, she willed herself to sleep.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived punctually at Harvard University's gates.

The moment she stepped out of the car, she felt countless eyes on her.

Yet whenever she glanced their way, people hastily averted their gazes.

"That's Evelyn Laurent? She's even more stunning than the rumors say."

"I heard she was a scholarship student from some small town."

"Professor Klein's personally selected protégé. Unbelievable."

The whispers followed her.

Evelyn frowned slightly and strode briskly toward the lecture hall.
###Chapter 216

"I'd love to meet someone like her. She's incredible."

A group of girls whispered among themselves, stealing glances at Evelyn Laurent.

Evelyn noticed their stares but paid no mind.

She walked straight into the Physics Department classroom.

The room was already half-filled with students.

"Sister Evelyn! Over here!" Lillian Rothschild waved excitedly.

Ever since their last group project, Lillian had become Evelyn's biggest admirer.

Eight other girls from their group quickly gathered around.

"Try this sandwich, Sister Evelyn!"

"I bought your favorite milk tea!"

"You have to taste this chocolate—it's amazing!"

Within moments, a small mountain of snacks piled up before Evelyn.

She looked at their bright, eager faces and felt warmth bloom in her chest.

Evelyn accepted their gifts without protest.

She couldn't bear to see their hopeful expressions dim.

Sophia Lowell entered the classroom just as the scene unfolded.

Her fingers tightened around her backpack straps as she silently took her seat.

"Such a show-off," Lydia Montgomery muttered under her breath, leaning closer. "Just because she's pretty."

Lydia came from modest means with average looks.

She desperately clung to Sophia's coattails for social leverage.

Sophia's lips curved slightly. "Ignore her. Let's focus on ourselves."

She opened her textbook but couldn't process a single word.

Sebastian Royston had been missing for nearly a week.

That lunatic better stay gone forever.

Sophia shuddered at the thought of what would happen if he returned.

Just then, murmurs rippled through the doorway.

Nigel Winthrop stood in the hallway, sunlight glinting off his perfectly styled hair.

"Could someone fetch Sophia Lowell for me?" he asked politely.

A messenger soon approached.

Sophia frowned but stepped outside.

"Breakfast for you." Nigel smiled, handing her a paper bag.

The bag bore the logo of the most exclusive patisserie in the city.
###Chapter 217

Nigel Winthrop stood at the classroom doorway, sunlight streaming through the corridor windows to cast a warm halo around him.

He leaned forward slightly, offering a paper bag to Sophia Lowell. "Try this."

Sophia froze, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her blouse.

"Take it." Nigel pressed the bag into her hands without waiting for a response. As he turned, golden light caught in his hair.

Sophia cradled the still-warm breakfast, her cheeks flushing pink.

She practically floated back to her seat, fingertips tracing the embossed logo on the bag.

"Oh my god! Isn't this from that bakery with the two-hour wait?" Lydia Montgomery gasped dramatically, covering her mouth. "Sophia, who gave this to you?"

Girls immediately swarmed around, chattering excitedly.

"It must be an admirer!"

"Of course someone would bring Sophia breakfast—she's gorgeous!"

Sophia gave a modest smile. "Just a classmate."

Her gaze flickered toward the other side of the room, but Evelyn Laurent didn't even look up.

Lillian Rothschild scoffed. "Stop pretending. It's just breakfast."

"Exactly. Always showing off," another girl chimed in. "Evelyn wouldn't care about this."

Sophia bit her lower lip and slowly unwrapped the package.

The rich aroma of crab rosettes filled the air, drawing gasps from the crowd.

"You're the best, Sophia!" Lydia stared longingly at the food. "These are impossible to get..."

With graceful poise, Sophia gestured. "Let's all share."

"Only a Lowell heiress would casually split such an expensive breakfast," Lydia fawned. "You probably dine at Michelin-starred restaurants every day, right?"

Sophia nodded demurely, though her eyes kept drifting toward Evelyn.

But until the very end, Evelyn never glanced their way.

The food disappeared quickly, leaving behind a single lonely shrimp dumpling.
###Chapter 218

Sophia's nails dug deep into her palms.

Yet her face maintained an elegant, composed smile, as if completely unfazed by everything before her.

God knew how badly she wanted to flip this table.

This breakfast had cost her half a month's allowance, and now it was being devoured by these vultures.

"Sophia, these shrimp dumplings are amazing!"

"Oh my god, the custard buns are to die for!"

The chorus of praise around her stabbed at her heart like knives.

With practiced grace, she picked up the last crystal shrimp dumpling.

The burst of savory flavor between her teeth nearly brought tears to her eyes.

Not from emotion.

From rage.

At the classroom's back door, Nigel Winthrop's figure flashed past.

He watched with satisfaction as Sophia shared her breakfast with their classmates.

"Truly the behavior of a young lady from a prominent family."

Nigel's lips curled into a triumphant smile.

The identity of the seventh Lowell daughter was exactly the stepping stone he needed.

Climbing this social ladder would solve the Winthrop family's crisis in one stroke.

His steps were noticeably lighter as he walked away.

"Sophia, you're so kind to us."

Lydia Montgomery fawned over her, eyes still glued to the empty food containers.

Sophia suppressed her disgust and gently patted Lydia's hand.

"That's what friends are for."

"By the way, Sophia," Lydia suddenly lowered her voice, "I heard your birthday is coming up?"

Sophia's spine stiffened instantly.

"Your eighteenth birthday—the Lowells must be planning something grand, right?"

Eager gazes immediately turned toward her.

Sophia's fingertips turned icy.

She had no idea how the real seventh Lowell daughter would celebrate.

"Of course there will be a celebration." She lifted her chin with a flawless smile. "Would you all like to come?"

The classroom erupted in cheers.

Sophia's smile froze in place.

She was already calculating where to borrow money for this nonexistent birthday party.
###Chapter 219

"Sophia, are we really invited to your birthday party?" Lydia Montgomery's voice trembled with excitement.

Her eyes sparkled as she nervously twisted her fingers together.

Sophia Lowell was the treasured heiress of the Lowell family. Attending her birthday gala could mean rubbing shoulders with high society. Even if she couldn't make connections, just witnessing the extravagance would give her bragging rights for months.

The classroom erupted in chatter as classmates swarmed around them.

Sophia dug her nails into her palms, maintaining a saccharine smile. "Of course! But..."

She batted her eyelashes playfully. "My brothers are throwing me a private family dinner too. That one's just for relatives."

"Totally understandable!"

"You're the best, Sophia!"

Her smile turned rigid, but she kept her graceful composure.

Across the room, Lillian Rothschild scoffed.

"Such a performance," she whispered to Evelyn Laurent. "What kind of decent party could she possibly throw?"

Evelyn flipped a textbook page without looking up. "Let her be."

Her finger paused on the calendar.

A red-circled date ten days away glared back at her.

For the first time, she noticed her own birthday.

Previous years found her either working part-time or buried in assignments. The Vincent Lowells never remembered, and she'd grown accustomed to ignoring it.

But now everything had changed.

Thinking of her doting brothers and adoring parents, Evelyn's lips curved upward unbidden.

She was actually looking forward to this birthday.

Meanwhile at the Lowell mansion, her brothers were in a frenzy of preparations.

"Director, wrap the last two episodes this week," Julian Langley commanded over the phone. "Nothing takes priority over my sister's birthday."

Alexander Langley canceled all overseas trips, buried in paperwork at his office.

Sebastian Langley's studio overflowed with fabric swatches as he scrutinized design drafts.

Deep in the research facility, Nathaniel Langley methodically pulled on latex gloves.

"How are we feeling today?" He adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses and lifted a glinting syringe.

On the hospital bed, Sebastian Royston convulsed violently, emitting choked whimpers of terror.
###Chapter 220

Sebastian Royston thrashed violently, the metallic clank of shackles echoing through the sterile room.

His wrists were raw and bleeding.

"Nathaniel Langley! You're insane!"

The hysterical scream bounced off soundproof walls.

Nathaniel adjusted his cuffs with deliberate slowness, his frosty gaze magnified behind gold-rimmed glasses.

"Still not accustomed after two days, Mr. Royston?"

He trailed fingers along gleaming surgical instruments on the steel tray.

Sebastian's pupils contracted to pinpricks.

"My family will destroy you!"

His voice cracked with unshed tears.

Nathaniel's lips curved as he selected a syringe.

"Sedative. Or perhaps..."

His attention shifted to the scalpel's razor edge.

Sebastian trembled like a cornered animal.

"I was forced into this!"

Nathaniel shook his head, the needle glinting under fVossrescent lights.

"The volunteer agreement bears your signature."

He leaned down, voice deceptively gentle.

"Tell me who ordered the attack on Evelyn."

Sebastian bit his lip until it bled, sweat soaking his hospital gown.

The needle pierced skin. His scream shredded the air.

Nathaniel impassively depressed the plunger.

"Just the first dose."

Removing his glasses, he revealed eyes that promised nightmares.

"Don't worry. I'll cure your psychosis."

"My way."

Sebastian convulsed, eyeballs bulging.

Nathaniel activated the recorder, clinically noting observations.

"Abnormal muscle tension. Pain sensitivity increased 300%."

He bent close to Sebastian's ear.

"Know why I chose you?"

"You touched what's mine."

The syringe lifted again. Sebastian broke.

"The Croix family! It was Liam—"

Nathaniel froze.

He set the needle aside, patting Sebastian's contorted cheek.

"Should've cooperated sooner."

His white coat swirled like an arctic wind as he turned away.
###Chapter 221

Sebastian Royston lost consciousness from excruciating pain.

Nathaniel Langley didn't even flinch as he meticulously recorded the experimental data.

The pen scratched against paper until he suddenly paused.

His gaze lingered on Sebastian's pallid body.

A flicker of madness flashed in his eyes before vanishing into calm.

He inhaled deeply and placed the scalpel back on the tray.

Not yet.

Live dissection was too cruel.

Even for Sebastian Royston.

At least...not until he'd outlived his usefulness.

Nathaniel turned away as the heavy metal door sealed shut behind him.

No one would ever discover this underground laboratory's secrets.

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains onto Evelyn Laurent's duvet on her birthday.

Rubbing her eyes, she descended the stairs to find her entire family waiting in the dining room.

"Happy birthday, Evelyn!"

Her six brothers' synchronized greeting made her freeze mid-step.

A steaming bowl of longevity noodles sat on the table as Victoria Langley sprinkled chopped scallions.

"Come here, darling. I made them myself." Victoria beckoned with a smile.

Evelyn's eyes prickled with warmth as she hurried over.

Richard Langley looked years younger in casual wear instead of his usual suits. "After school today, Ethan will take you to Symphony Heights."

"That's...?"

"A new music restaurant," Julian Langley interjected. "We reserved the penthouse."

Just as Evelyn started to protest, her father added, "Just family."

She pressed her lips into a smile and began eating.

The noodles were perfectly chewy, the broth rich, even the egg had a molten yolk.

After breakfast, she grabbed her backpack. "Off to school!"

Instead of the family Bentley, Ethan Sullivan's Maybach idled outside.

The window lowered to reveal his striking profile. "Happy birthday, Evelyn."

She blinked before sliding into the passenger seat. "No meetings today?"

"On my way." He turned the steering wheel with a faint smile.

In truth, he'd woken at 4 AM just to drive her himself.

As they merged onto the main road, he casually asked, "Any special gift requests?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "I'll love anything from you."

Sunlight dappled gold across her lashes.

Ethan's grip tightened on the wheel.

His heartbeat skipped.
###Chapter 222

Evelyn Laurent shook her head calmly. "No need."

Birthday gifts had never meant much to her.

Her walk-in closet was already overflowing with presents from her parents and brothers.

The allowance in her bank account was more than she could ever spend.

She could buy anything she wanted whenever she pleased.

A flicker of resignation passed through Ethan Sullivan's eyes.

But he said nothing more.

The black Maybach glided to a stop near Harvard University.

Evelyn habitually exited the car early.

"Let me take you to the gate," Ethan frowned.

"No." Her refusal was crisp.

The entrance would be crowded at this hour.

She had no desire to become the center of attention.

Ethan could only watch as she walked away.

The classroom buzzed with excitement.

"Happy birthday, Sophia!"

"I picked this gift just for you!"

Students swarmed around Sophia Lowell, eagerly thrusting presents at her.

Sophia sat primly at her desk, a flawless smile on her lips.

"Thank you, everyone."

Her heart swelled with glee.

Though the gifts varied in quality, they were all freebies.

The Lowell family name truly opened doors.

Lydia Montgomery squeezed through the crowd, cradling an exquisitely wrapped box.

"Sophia, this music box is for you."

She nervously twisted her fingers.

"I saved up my allowance for months..."

The metal music box gleamed under the sunlight.

A flash of disdain crossed Sophia's eyes.

But she instantly feigned delight.

"It's gorgeous! I love it."

Lydia exhaled in relief.

This investment would pay off.

As long as she clung to the Lowells' coattails...

"I'm hosting a birthday dinner at Symphony Heights tonight," Sophia announced abruptly.

The classroom erupted.

"Oh my god! That new ultra-exclusive music venue?"

"I heard reservations are booked solid for three months!"

Sophia flipped her hair with practiced grace.

"No big deal."

Her heart bled.

Securing that reservation had nearly drained her savings.

But this party was non-negotiable.

Isabella Valentine suddenly rose from the back row.

She strode to Sophia's desk, face icy.

"You're having your party at Symphony Heights?"
###Chapter 223

Isabella Valentine tapped her fingers lightly on the desk.

The noisy chatter in the classroom made her frown, especially the shrill laughter from Sophia Lowell's group.

As the most distinguished figure in the Physics Department, the Valentine heiress always kept to herself.

Her almond-shaped eyes carried an innate arrogance, as if she looked down on everyone with faint disdain.

Many had tried to approach this privileged young woman, only to be deterred by her frosty demeanor.

Over time, no one dared disturb her peace.

"Sophia."

Isabella's voice cut through the air like ice.

Sophia, surrounded by admirers, turned in surprise.

"Isabella?"

"I heard you're hosting a birthday party at Symphony Heights?" Isabella twirled a pen idly.

Sophia's eyes lit up. "Yes, tonight!"

"May I come?"

The question exploded like a bomb in the classroom.

Sophia flushed with excitement. "Of course! I'd be honored!"

She was already calculating how Isabella's presence would elevate her social standing.

Isabella gave a slight nod, her lips curling into an almost imperceptible smirk as she turned away.

"Sophia, is Isabella bowing to you now?" Lydia Montgomery whispered.

"She must know your family outranks hers. That's why she's sucking up."

"Exactly. The Valentines can't compete with the Lowells."

The girls exchanged hushed remarks, their voices dripping with flattery.

Sophia's lips curved smugly.

She didn't notice Isabella glancing back at her with the disdainful look one reserves for clowns.

A phone screen lit up.

Isabella typed swiftly: Sophia's throwing her birthday bash at Symphony Heights tonight.

Evelyn Laurent was organizing her notes when the message arrived.

She smirked and replied: Let her play her little game.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the final class ended.

Sophia led a procession of over twenty classmates through the campus gates.

"How are we getting there?" someone asked eagerly.

"Taxis, of course," Sophia declared. "Symphony Heights isn't just any venue."

Isabella lingered at the back, watching the excited crowd with cold amusement.

She pulled out her phone and sent another message: The show's about to begin.
###Chapter 224

Sophia Lowell stood at the school gate, raising her hand to hail a cab when a sharp, mocking laugh sounded behind her.

"Sophia, are you really making everyone squeeze into taxis?" Isabella Valentine sauntered over in stilettos, twirling her car keys between her fingers. "Can't the Lowells even arrange a decent car?"

Her red lips curled as she swept a disdainful glance over the group.

All eyes instantly locked onto Sophia.

Sophia's fingers trembled. Heat rushed to her cheeks. She tightened her grip on her bag strap, forcing a smile. "Sorry, I didn't think—"

"Don't say that, Sophia!"
"Going to Symphony Heights is already amazing!"
"It's your birthday—you call the shots!"

Several girls quickly jumped in to smooth things over.

Isabella scoffed and pulled out her phone. "Uncle Wang, bring the car around."

In under three minutes, a black Maybach glided to the curb. The driver hurried to open the door for her.

"Passenger seat's free." Isabella leaned against the car, scanning the crowd. "Who wants a ride?"

Instantly, girls surged forward. "Me!"
"Take me too!"

Half of Sophia's friends abandoned her in seconds.

Isabella carelessly pointed at three before sliding in. As the door closed, she shot Sophia a smirk. "See you at Symphony Heights."

Exhaust fumes blasted Sophia in the face.

Lydia Montgomery dug her nails into her palm to stop herself from following. She peeked at Sophia's stormy expression and whispered, "Taxis are fine, Sophia..."

Sophia's nails bit into her own flesh.

Isabella was doing this on purpose!

From suddenly agreeing to attend the party to publicly humiliating her—every move felt like a calculated trap. But then again, Isabella had always been arrogant. Would she really go out of her way to target her?

"Let's go." Sophia took a deep breath and flagged down the third taxi.

By the time they arrived at Symphony Heights, Isabella was sipping tea with effortless grace. She set down her cup lazily as Sophia entered. "Took you long enough."

Sophia opened her mouth to explain—

"Table number?" Isabella cut her off. "Don't tell me you didn't even reserve a spot."
###Chapter 225

Isabella Valentine shot Sophia Lowell an icy glare.

The temperature in the private room seemed to plummet.

Three girls sat obediently beside Isabella, their eyes locked on Sophia.

Sophia clutched the hem of her dress, her voice barely a whisper. "It's... on the second floor."

"The second floor?" Isabella rose abruptly, her stilettos clicking sharply against the floor.

She looked down at Sophia with a mocking smirk. "What? You think we don't deserve the penthouse?"

Sophia paled. "No! The penthouse was already reserved..."

Isabella stepped closer, tapping Sophia's shoulder with a manicured finger. "If you can't even secure a decent room, why bother pretending to be important?"

Sophia dug her nails into her palms, fighting back tears.

Of course she knew the penthouse was the best.

But it had been reserved for Evelyn Laurent—someone she wasn't even allowed to inquire about.

"Isabella!" Lydia Montgomery suddenly slammed her hands on the table. "Sophia invited us out of kindness. How dare you speak to her like that?"

The other girls chimed in. "Yeah, that's too much!"

Isabella twirled her diamond earring dismissively. "A tacky gathering like this doesn't deserve my respect."

She turned toward the reception desk, the sharp swish of her black dress cutting through the air.

"Fifth floor. I'm booking it." She tossed down her black card, then glanced back with a raised brow. "Anyone who wants to join me, we're moving now."

The room erupted.

"Wait, we can really go to the fifth floor?"
"Miss Valentine is so generous!"
"Sorry, Sophia..."

The crowd surged toward Isabella, leaving only Lydia behind.

Sophia stood alone in the empty room, her tears finally spilling onto the carpet.
###Chapter 226

Isabella Valentine's red lips curved in a smirk as she cast a challenging glance at Sophia Lowell.

"Follow me if you want to come." She lazily tossed her long hair.

Her stilettos clicked sharply against the marble floor.

A waiter respectfully pressed the elevator button for her.

Half the classmates followed without hesitation.

Sophia stood rooted in place, her nails digging deep into her palms.

She forced a smile. "It's my fault for not planning properly..."

"Sophia, don't blame yourself!" Someone immediately defended her.

"Isabella is just throwing her weight around!"

"How could she compare to Sophia's kindness?"

Hearing the support, a flicker of satisfaction flashed in Sophia's eyes.

She waved her hand with feigned magnanimity. "I really didn't arrange things well."

At the reception desk, Lydia Montgomery leaned in curiously. "Who booked the penthouse?"

"Apologies, that information is confidential." The attendant politely declined.

Lydia turned away in frustration and headed straight for the restroom.

Inside a stall, she suddenly overheard a conversation outside.

"I heard the penthouse was reserved by the Lowells?"

"Shh. It's for the seventh daughter's birthday banquet."

"Mr. Lowell will arrive soon..."

Lydia's pupils constricted.

She rushed back to Sophia, breathless with excitement. "Sophia! Incredible news!"

"What is it?" Sophia frowned.

"The penthouse was booked by your family! For the seventh daughter's birthday!"

Sophia's breath hitched.

The same birthday? The same restaurant?

Her heart pounded like a drum.

"Could it be..." Lydia's eyes gleamed. "A surprise from your family?"

Sophia instantly replaced her expression with a sweet smile. "They always do things like this."

She smoothed her hair, feigning playful exasperation. "Honestly, keeping secrets from me again."

Lydia gazed at her enviously. "Your family spoils you too much!"

"Of course they do." Sophia lifted her chin.

Her mind was already calculating how to exploit this "coincidence."
###Chapter 227

Sophia Lowell tilted her chin up with pride, a faint smile playing on her lips.

Lydia Montgomery leaned in close, whispering, "Sophia, since your family booked the penthouse, maybe we could—"

Sophia's heart sank.

A flicker of irritation flashed in her eyes.

How could Lydia be so tactless? Did she not know her place?

The audacity to even suggest going to the penthouse.

Greedy little thing.

Sophia suppressed her annoyance and forced a hesitant expression. "It's a surprise my family planned specially. I can't go up there early."

Lydia awkwardly shut her mouth and followed Sophia to the second floor with the others.

From their vantage point, they could see the grand crystal piano at the center of the hall.

Velvet ropes cordoned it off, its surface shimmering under the lights.

"Oh my god, that piano is stunning!" Lydia gasped, leaning over the railing.

Symphony Heights was undeniably luxurious, every detail exuding opulence.

Without Sophia's connections, none of them would have gotten in.

Sophia stared at the piano, her heart bleeding.

Just three hours on the second floor had cost three hundred thousand.

And that didn't include the meal.

The thought of footing the bill for ten people made her skin crawl.

What infuriated her more was that Isabella Valentine had taken the other half of their group.

It was a slap in the face.

"Everyone, order whatever you like," Sophia said with a strained smile.

The waiter handed out menus, and the group erupted.

"Three thousand eight hundred for a steak?"
"Is this soup made with gold?"
"This is insane!"

Sophia's eye twitched at their gasps.

"It's my birthday. Don't hold back," she said sweetly before excusing herself to make a call.

"Nigel, where are you?" Her voice instantly softened.

"I'm almost there. Happy birthday, Sophia," came Nigel Winthrop's clear voice.

Hanging up, she smoothed her dress.

Soon, Nigel appeared at the entrance in a tailored black suit, a delicate velvet box in hand.

"Nigel!" Sophia's eyes lit up as she hurried over.

His gaze swept the room, a barely perceptible frown forming.

He'd expected her family, not just a bunch of classmates.

"Happy birthday," he said, masking his confusion as he handed her the gift.
###Chapter 228

Nigel Winthrop extended a velvet jewelry box with his slender fingers, presenting it to Sophia Lowell.

Sophia's fingertips trembled slightly as she accepted the box, nearly fumbling it. "Thank you," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

"Between us, no thanks are necessary." A faint smile curved Nigel's lips, warmth shimmering in his eyes. "Open it?"

Lydia Montgomery dug her nails into her best friend's arm to stifle a squeal. The tender way Nigel looked at Sophia was enough to make anyone's heart race.

Sophia took a deep breath and lifted the lid. A flash of crimson caught the light—a ruby gleaming like a drop of frozen blood, breathtaking in its brilliance.

"Oh my God!" Lydia gasped. "How much did this cost?"

Sophia snapped the box shut as if burned. "It's too extravagant. I can't accept this." She bit her lip and pushed it back toward him, her nails leaving faint marks on the velvet.

Nigel didn't budge. "I chose it especially for you." His voice lowered. "Consider it... proof of my feelings."

Three million meant nothing. Securing the Lowell heiress would solve Winthrop Realty's crisis in one stroke.

Sophia's ears flushed pink, her pulse hammering so hard she feared it might leap from her chest. Such an extravagant gift, such tender gazes—he must truly...

"Mr. Winthrop and Sophia look perfect together," Lydia interjected smoothly, her eyes glinting with calculation.

"Lydia!" Sophia stomped her foot in embarrassment but couldn't resist stealing a glance at Nigel.

He stepped closer suddenly, his gaze burning into hers. "She's right." His voice roughened. "Ever since the Centennial Gala, you're the only one I see."

Sophia's breath hitched.

"Do you believe in love at first sight?" Nigel murmured.

"I do." Her reply was feather-soft before she met his eyes boldly. "Because I—"

"Let me say it first." Nigel dropped to one knee. "Sophia Lowell, will you be my girlfriend?"

Gasps rippled through the onlookers.

Sophia's eyes welled up, her lips parting to answer—

"Tch." A derisive scoff cut through the moment. "Perfect match indeed. A playboy and a Green Tea Bitch—made for each other."
###Chapter 229

A mocking laugh suddenly echoed from the second-floor staircase.

Sophia Lowell jerked her head up. Nigel Winthrop's expression darkened instantly.

Isabella Valentine leaned against the railing, crimson lips curling. "What a perfect match."

Her fingers tapped lightly on the handrail, eyes brimming with derision.

Lydia Montgomery immediately jumped in. "What do you mean by that, Isabella?"

"Exactly what I said." Isabella idly adjusted her wristwatch. "A narcissist and a Green Tea Bitch. Made for each other."

Nigel clenched his fists but remained silent.

He knew better than anyone the power of the Valentine family.

"Let's go." Sophia murmured softly, her fingertips grazing Nigel's palm.

Nigel's thoughts instantly scattered.

A waiter approached with a food cart bearing black truffle steak on crystal plates.

"Wow!" Lydia gasped theatrically. "How much does this cost?"

Sophia elegantly picked up her cutlery. "Help yourselves, everyone."

Meanwhile, in the mall's VIP lounge...

Ethan Sullivan handed his black card to the sales associate. "Wrap everything."

Evelyn Laurent nibbled her lollipop. "This is too much."

"Not at all." Ethan ruffled her hair. "Compared to what your brothers gave you, this is nothing."

Evelyn suddenly leaned closer. "So...what's my real birthday present?"

Ethan flashed a mysterious smile. "Come with me."

The elevator ascended to the rooftop helipad.

A pink helicopter glittered under the sunlight.

"Like it?" Ethan embraced her from behind. "No more crowded subways for school."

Evelyn turned and poked his chest. "Such a spendthrift."

Ethan caught her finger. "Only for you."
###Chapter 230

Ethan Sullivan chuckled softly. "This doesn't count as a gift."

His gaze lingered on Evelyn Laurent, warmth hidden in his eyes. "I've prepared a special surprise. You'll love it."

"Oh?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

She was curious to see where Ethan got such confidence.

Even she didn't know what she'd particularly like.

Ethan winked mysteriously. "The timing's perfect. Let me take you there."

"Alright."

Evelyn agreed readily.

Ethan instructed the mall to deliver their shopping bags to Beverly Hills. Then he personally drove her toward the outskirts.

The scenery outside the window blurred past.

The setting sun painted the clouds in gold and crimson, casting a warm glow over the city.

Evelyn leaned back in her seat, her eyes unconsciously drifting to Ethan's profile.

Over their time together, he had treated her exceptionally well.

As attentively as her brothers.

Perhaps they could remain friends after the engagement was called off.

Ethan had no idea of her thoughts.

If he knew she only saw him as a future friend, he'd be both amused and exasperated.

At least she was willing to consider him a friend.

The car stopped in front of a massive venue.

"Where is this?"

Evelyn stepped out, surveying the surroundings.

The building had a unique design, resembling a sports arena.

"The surprise is inside."

Ethan smiled and reached for her hand.

Evelyn deftly avoided it.

Though inexperienced in romance, she understood boundaries.

Unfazed, Ethan pulled out a blindfold. "Since it's a surprise, why not let me guide you in?"

His voice was so tender it could melt ice.

Evelyn studied him, her curiosity piqued.

After a brief hesitation, she gave a slight nod.

Ethan moved behind her, his fingers brushing her hair as he carefully tied the blindfold.

"Walk slowly."

He took her hand.

The sudden darkness made Evelyn's heart skip.

Her fingers instinctively tightened around his.

"Don't worry. I'm here."

Ethan's voice was close, soothing against her ear.

For some reason, it made her feel safe.
###Chapter 231
The venue shimmered with brilliant lights. Ethan Sullivan's palm was warm and dry against her skin.

He felt the faint tremor in Evelyn Laurent's fingertips and instinctively tightened his grip.

"Don't be nervous." His deep voice carried a soothing weight.

The massive doors sealed shut behind them with a whisper.

When the blindfold slipped away, Evelyn gasped at the breathtaking sight before her.

The space stretched wider than a football field. Compound bows stood in military precision along the left wall, while an arsenal of replica firearms lined the right. Shooting ranges divided the area with surgical precision—stationary targets blending into moving ones.

Ethan withdrew a document from his suit's inner pocket.

"Happy birthday." The corners of his mouth lifted as he offered her a fountain pen.

Evelyn's pupils dilated when she recognized the contents.

A property transfer agreement.

"This..." Her voice wavered.

His gaze burned into her. "I started planning this after seeing how much you enjoyed yourself last time."

Her fingers absently traced the paper's edge.

Fifteen days.

She couldn't fathom how such a facility materialized in half a month.

"How much?" She jerked her head up.

"Five hundred million." His expression remained unreadable.

The air turned viscous.

Evelyn snapped the folder shut. "It's too extravagant."

Ethan's eyes darkened dangerously.

"Evelyn." His voice held a razor's edge. "Are you rejecting my gift?"

She swallowed hard under the storm brewing in his gaze.

"I just—"

"Just what?" He stepped forward, caging her between the equipment rack and his body. "Don't take me seriously?"

His breath fanned across her face, laced with inexorable dominance.
###Chapter 232

Ethan Sullivan stood at the center of the venue, his Adam's apple bobbing slightly.

He yearned to blurt it out—that he wanted to be Evelyn Laurent's boyfriend, her future husband.

But the words died on his lips.

He feared startling her.

"This venue..." Ethan lowered his gaze, fingertips lightly tapping the contract. "I had my team work day and night to finish it for today."

Sunlight streamed through the glass dome, casting fragmented shadows across his sharp profile.

Evelyn stared at the brand-new space before her.

Every detail spoke of meticulous care.

"If you refuse it," Ethan suddenly looked up, stubbornness flickering in his eyes, "then let it rot here."

His voice was soft, yet unyielding.

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

She suddenly recalled how Ethan had been taking mysterious phone calls these past two weeks.

So this was why.

"Thanks." She signed her name with a flourish, flashing him a radiant smile. "I love my birthday gift."

Stars ignited in Ethan's eyes.

"Your favorite?" He couldn't resist pressing, hope threading his tone.

Evelyn tilted her head in thought.

She hadn't seen her family's surprise yet.

"But your gift," she met his gaze earnestly, "truly moved me."

Ethan's breath hitched.

He drank in the sight of her smiling face, his throat working.

"Try it?" he suggested hoarsely, fighting to keep his emotions in check.

Evelyn's eyes lit up. She grabbed his hand and dashed toward the court.

Caught off guard, Ethan stumbled forward.

The moment their palms touched, his heart hammered wildly.

This was the first time she'd initiated contact.

The moment shattered when Victoria Langley's call came through.

"Oh no!" Evelyn gasped at the time. "Mom and the others have arrived!"

She bolted like a startled rabbit.

Watching her flustered retreat, Ethan chuckled low in his throat.

Second floor of Symphony Heights.

Lydia Montgomery stirred her coffee absently.

"Sophia," she whispered, "I heard the Lowells booked the penthouse for Evelyn's birthday."

Her eyes kept darting upward.

Sophia Lowell's grip tightened on her napkin.

"Maybe..." Lydia leaned closer, "we should take a peek first?"

Just how extravagant was the penthouse?

Her curiosity burned.

Sophia pressed her lips together.

A voice inside urged her—Go see. After all, it'll be yours someday.
###Chapter 233

Sophia Lowell's fingertips trembled slightly.

She stared at the flickering elevator numbers, her throat tight. The penthouse of Symphony Heights was within reach, yet it felt like a ticking time bomb.

"Sophia, why are you so pale?" Lydia Montgomery suddenly leaned in.

Sophia snapped out of her daze and forced a smile. "The air conditioning must be too cold."

She adjusted her expensive cashmere coat—three months' worth of allowance spent just to make an impression tonight.

The elevator mirror reflected her flawless makeup. Her face bore a striking resemblance to Evelyn Laurent, the seventh daughter of the Lowell family. That was her greatest advantage.

Ding—

The doors slid open.

Nigel Winthrop stepped out first, his eyes gleaming. He turned and extended a hand. "Sophia, come."

She took a deep breath and placed her hand in his.

The penthouse lights dazzled her. A champagne tower glittered at the center, waiters weaving through the crowd. On the distant terrace, men in tailored suits conversed.

"Is that your brothers?" Nigel whispered.

Sophia dug her nails into her palm. She didn’t recognize any of them.

"Let’s not approach yet," she suddenly pulled Nigel back. "I want... to surprise them."

Lydia had already rushed to the champagne tower for selfies. Others dispersed, marveling at the lavish decor.

But Nigel’s gaze remained fixed on the terrace. "Sophia, introduce me to your family?"

A cold sweat trickled down her back.

Then, the ballroom doors swung open.

"President Lowell has arrived—"

The room fell silent. Sophia’s blood turned to ice.

A tall figure strode in, flanked by attendants. His sharp features and immaculate suit exuded authority.

Her legs weakened.

Vincent Lowell.

The man who ruled the Lowell Group.

She’d only seen him in financial magazines. Now, he was walking straight toward her.
###Chapter 234

The elevator doors slid open, and Lydia Montgomery dashed out first.

"Oh my God!"

Her eyes widened in astonishment.

The penthouse was far more spacious than expected, with floor-to-ceiling windows showcasing the city's nightscape. A massive LED screen hung at the center, displaying dazzling animations.

"These flowers..."

Someone crouched to touch the dewy roses. The petals glistened with fresh droplets, clearly just arranged.

The crystal grand piano shimmered under the lights, more exquisite than the one downstairs. Rose petals adorned its keys as if awaiting a master's touch.

Sophia Lowell's heartbeat quickened.

How she wished she truly were the seventh daughter of the Lowell family.

"Sophia," Lydia whispered excitedly, eyes gleaming. "May I pick some roses? They're breathtaking."

The floral scent permeated the air. Sophia scanned the room before nodding with feigned generosity. "Take what you like."

Lydia immediately cheered and rushed toward the blossoms.

Nigel Winthrop stood aside, surveying the priceless paintings lining the walls—each a testament to the Lowell fortune. His fist clenched tighter, reinforcing his resolve to pursue Sophia.

"Come see!"

An excited voice called from across the room.

A long table overflowed with exquisitely wrapped gift boxes. Ribbons shimmered under the lights, forming a small mountain of varying sizes.

"These must be gifts from your brothers?" someone asked enviously.

Sophia lifted her chin proudly. "Of course. They adore me."

Yet bitterness churned inside her.

These should have belonged to the real seventh daughter.

"Hey, what's this?"

Lydia plucked colorful pebbles from a flowerpot. They sparkled strangely in her palm, as if enchanted.

"Sophia, can I keep a few?" She gazed at Sophia expectantly.

"Help yourself." Sophia waved dismissively, forcing composure.

Classmates immediately crowded around, scrambling for the gemstones. Laughter echoed through the penthouse—no one noticed the fleeting sorrow in Sophia's eyes.

###Chapter 235

In the glass conservatory of Symphony Heights Penthouse, the waitress Zhang clenched her tray.

She watched the giggling group of girls, hesitating to speak several times.

That was Sophia Lowell. The youngest daughter of the Lowell family.

She quietly retreated to a corner and sent a text message.

"Oh my God! These succulents are absolutely adorable!" A short-haired girl suddenly rushed to the windowsill, lightly touching the plump leaves. "Sophia, can I take one home?"

Sophia Lowell glanced at her wristwatch and waved dismissively. "Take whatever you like."

She strode toward the elevator, her heels clicking urgently against the carpet. "We need to go. My parents will be here soon."

Lydia Montgomery couldn’t resist snapping off another rose. The girls’ arms were already full of their loot.

As the elevator doors closed, Zhang finally exhaled in relief.

Down in the lobby, the manager’s phone buzzed. His expression darkened as he read the message.

"Stop them!"

Eight security guards formed a human barricade. Lydia nearly dropped the succulent in her arms. "What’s the meaning of this? Do you know who we are?"

The manager’s gaze swept over the flowers in their arms. His voice turned icy. "The rare roses from the penthouse retail at $3,800 per stem. Those succulents are lithops airlifted from South Africa by Mr. Lowell—each pot is insured for $250,000."

"Two hundred fifty thousand?" One girl’s hands trembled, sending a pot shattering to the floor.

Sophia’s nails dug into her palms. She suddenly remembered the auction receipt her eldest brother had posted in the family group chat last week.

Lydia shrieked, "This is extortion! Sophia is—"

"I’ll pay." Sophia cut her off, her voice shaking. "I’ll cover all the damages."

The manager offered a professional smile. "Miss Sophia, Mr. Lowell has informed us that you’ve already exceeded this month’s allowance." He turned to the guards. "Call the police."

As sirens wailed in the distance, Sophia finally remembered the blocked number—the message from her brother last week had indeed mentioned an upcoming succulent exhibition.
###Chapter 236

The hotel manager swept a cold gaze over the panicked girls, his lips curling into a mocking smirk.

"Those succulents are worthless," he drawled.

"But the planters you smashed are genuine antiques from the Ming and Qing dynasties."

"The cheapest one is valued at two hundred thousand."

Before he finished speaking, several girls' legs gave out beneath them.

Lydia Montgomery clutched the broken shards in her hand, her knuckles turning white.

"As for those stones in your hands," the manager's voice cut like a blade, "they're all remnants of Burmese jade."

"That handful you're holding," he pointed at one girl, "is worth at least three hundred thousand."

The air froze solid.

All eyes turned to Sophia Lowell, pleading for salvation.

Sophia forced herself forward, her voice barely above a whisper. "Sir, this was our mistake. I'll cover the damages. Could we... avoid involving the police?"

Seeing his expression soften, she hastily added, "Perhaps we could discuss this somewhere more private?"

Inside the private room, staff tallied the losses.

"Antique planters—eight hundred thousand. Succulents—three million. Jade remnants—five million." The manager tapped his calculator. "With the dining charges, the total comes to ten million and thirty thousand."

The number made Sophia's vision darken.

She dug her nails into her palms to keep from fainting on the spot.

These idiots!

"Charge it," she said, her hand trembling as she handed over her credit card.

The manager nodded approvingly before leaving.

When the card returned to her grasp, Sophia could almost hear her heart shattering.

"May we leave now?" She forced a smile.

Once granted permission, she took a deep breath and pushed open the door.

Security still surrounded the girls.

"Just a misunderstanding," Sophia said breezily. "My apologies for the commotion."

As the guards dispersed, Lydia crept forward nervously. "Sophia, is everything really okay?"

"What could possibly be wrong?" Sophia waved a dismissive hand. "The manager mistook us for someone else."

"Sophia, you're amazing!" The girls swarmed around her again. "What about these—"

"Keep them." Sophia's smile was sweet, but her nails bit into her palms.

These bloodsuckers!

Her ten million—

All wasted on these brainless fools!
###Chapter 237

Sophia's nails dug deep into her palms.

She forced herself to maintain an elegant facade, barely containing her rage. Thankfully, the hotel manager had the sense not to expose her lie in front of everyone.

If her classmates found out the truth...

She couldn't bear to imagine the humiliation.

"Sophia, these gifts are too extravagant..." Her classmates trembled as they held the jewelry.

She forced a flawless smile. "It's nothing."

Inside, she was bleeding.

Every piece was real gold and diamonds!

What terrified her more was the thought of running into an actual member of the Lowell family...

Just the idea made her blood run cold.

"Let's go." She turned gracefully, her heels clicking rapidly against the floor.

Too lost in their sudden windfall, none of her classmates noticed the slight tremble in her shoulders.

Meanwhile, a black Maybach glided to a stop nearby.

Evelyn Lowell glanced idly out the window, catching sight of Sophia's hurried retreat.

A mocking smirk curled her lips.

"What are you looking at?" Ethan Sullivan murmured.

"Nothing." Evelyn turned away. "Just a pathetic fraud."

The glass walls of Symphony Heights reflected her flawless profile.

The ambiance here was indeed exquisite.

Elsewhere, Sophia finally bid farewell to the last of her classmates.

"Nigel, I'm so sorry." She bit her lip, eyes brimming with feigned remorse.

Nigel Winthrop patted her shoulder gently. "Don't worry. There will be other opportunities."

A calculating gleam flickered in his eyes.

This foolish woman was the perfect stepping stone into the Lowell family.

As Nigel's car disappeared down the street, Sophia's smile vanished instantly.

"Bloodsuckers!" She viciously kicked a pebble on the sidewalk.

Ten million!

Gone, just like that.

She spent half an hour in the restroom meticulously reapplying her makeup, ensuring perfection before stepping out.

Oversized sunglasses and a face mask concealed her features entirely.

"Quite the performance."

Isabella Valentine leaned lazily against a pillar, her red lips twisting into a sneer.

Sophia froze.

Why wouldn't this bitch leave her alone?

"Move." She hissed under her breath.

Isabella swirled her champagne glass leisurely. "How does it feel, pretending to be a Lowell heiress?"

Sophia's breath hitched.

"I don't know what you're talking about." She quickened her pace.

Isabella's mocking voice followed her. "Be careful—playing with fire gets you burned."

Sophia stumbled, nearly twisting her ankle.

She fled the restaurant without looking back.
###Chapter 238

The glass doors of Symphony Heights swung open. Evelyn Laurent glided in on stiletto heels, Ethan Sullivan following close behind with a protective hand hovering near her waist.

"Miss Evelyn, Mr. Sullivan." The manager rushed forward, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "My deepest apologies—someone trespassed into the penthouse..."

His voice trailed off as he bowed nearly ninety degrees.

Evelyn tapped the railing idly, cutting him off. "Was the loss recovered?"

"Every penny!" The manager exhaled in relief. "The culprit even paid triple compensation..."

Her crimson lips curved as Sophia Lowell's furious face flashed through her mind.

The elevator chimed open.

Isabella Valentine leaned against a marble column, tossing a velvet jewelry box with careless grace. "Happy birthday."

Before Evelyn could thank her, Isabella was already striding toward the revolving doors. The champagne silk of her dress swirled elegantly as she called over her shoulder, "Lovely ambiance. I'll be back."

Ethan might as well have been invisible.

Evelyn toyed with the box, amusement glinting in her eyes. Six months ago, this socialite had vowed to steal him away—now she couldn't even spare a glance.

"Evelyn!"

Victoria Langley's voice carried across the lobby. The Lowell family converged like constellations around their brightest star, Richard Langley even nudging Ethan aside to claim his daughter's other arm.

Inside the elevator, a server clenched her uniform skirt. Now she saw the true heiress of the Lowell dynasty—that innate elegance was something no imposter like Sophia could ever replicate.

"Safe travels, Miss Evelyn," she stammered, mentally cursing Sophia a thousand times. Next time that fraud showed up, she'd have security throw her out on sight.

The penthouse chandelier cast prismatic light over the diamonds at Evelyn's ears. Glancing back at the elevator display, she suddenly laughed.

Some fools weren't even worthy of being opponents.
###Chapter 239

The penthouse of Symphony Heights had been restored to its former glory. The plants vandalized by Sophia Lowell and her crew were now meticulously arranged, radiating new life.

Delicate succulents stood in artful clusters, their pots adorned with perfectly placed gemstone gravel.

It was fortunate they hadn't damaged anything else. The consequences would have been disastrous.

"Evelyn, come open your presents."

Victoria Langley took Evelyn Laurent's hand, leading her to a long table overflowing with gifts. Her eyes sparkled with anticipation. "Guess what surprise Mommy prepared for you?"

Evelyn stared at the mountain of presents. "Why so many?"

Victoria tenderly stroked her daughter's hair. "Today is your eighteenth birthday—your coming-of-age celebration. I missed seventeen years of your life. This is my way of making up for every single birthday."

Richard Langley stepped forward, his voice thick with emotion. "Daddy needs to repay those seventeen years too."

"Us too."

The six Langley brothers spoke in unison, their gazes overflowing with affection.

Ethan Sullivan lingered nearby, silently chastising himself.

He'd focused solely on renovating the outdoor venues, never anticipating the Langleys' extravagant gestures. Though internally flustered, he maintained his composure and discreetly retreated, giving Evelyn space with her family.

Evelyn's eyes grew misty.

She picked up the smallest gift box, carefully unwrapping it. Inside lay an exquisite longevity locket and a yellowed note: "Welcome to the world, my precious Evelyn. Mommy's first gift for you—may you live a hundred happy years."

Tears instantly blurred her vision.

This tiny locket carried the weight of boundless love. Taking a steadying breath, Evelyn moved to the next present.

Every gift contained a handwritten note brimming with familial devotion. Fighting back tears, she unwrapped each belated blessing.

Victoria kept her promise—gifting a private island. Richard bestowed Symphony Heights as her coming-of-age present. Alexander transferred 15% of his company shares. Sebastian designed a complete jewelry and wardrobe collection. Julian, Nathaniel, and Dominic handed her black cards without ceremony. Theodore gifted luxury vehicles and an exclusive beta-game.

After opening the last present, Victoria whispered, "Do you like them, sweetheart?"

Evelyn nodded vigorously, tears finally spilling over.

"No crying. Today should be joyful." Victoria pulled her daughter into an embrace, though her own tears fell freely.

Red-eyed, Richard enveloped the two most important women in his life in a tight hug.
###Chapter 240

The six brothers stood nearby, their gazes tender as they watched the scene unfold.

Evelyn Laurent quickly composed herself, wiping away her tears with the back of her hand. She flashed Victoria Langley a bright smile. "Mom, I want cake!"

Victoria beamed. "Julian, go get the cake!"

Julian Langley responded immediately. "On it!"

He strode toward the back of the room.

Alexander and Sebastian Langley followed without hesitation.

Together, the three brothers wheeled out an ornate dessert cart draped in satin.

The other three brothers busied themselves with candles, party hats, and utensils.

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with anticipation as she stared at the covered cart.

She had always had a sweet tooth.

Yet in seventeen years, she had never truly had a birthday cake of her own.

The only cake she remembered tasting was one she'd snatched from Brandon Lowell.

That year, on Brandon's birthday, he had tried to bully her—only to end up wailing as she beat him up. Without hesitation, she had stolen his cake.

The price was a brutal beating from Vincent Lowell.

From then on, she stopped expecting anything for her birthday.

She knew no one would ever give her a cake.

Vincent and Margaret Hill would never love her.

She had long since learned not to crave familial affection.

But now—

Her birth parents and brothers were determined to make up for those seventeen lost years.

They wanted her to be the happiest princess in the world.

The cart stopped in front of Evelyn.

She took a deep breath and lifted the satin cover.

Before her stood a towering seven-tier cake, each layer adorned with lifelike sugar flowers so exquisite they stole her breath.

Carefully, she removed the glass dome.

The rich scent of buttercream enveloped her.

She swallowed hard.

Her stomach growled—the archery match with Ethan Sullivan had drained her energy, and now the sweetness made her ravenous.

Victoria lit the candles and dimmed the penthouse lights.

Warm candlelight flickered in the darkness.

"Make a wish, Evelyn," Victoria murmured, gently placing a birthday hat on her daughter's head.

Evelyn bit back fresh tears, clasped her hands, and closed her eyes.

When she opened them again, she blew out every candle in one breath.

"Happy birthday, Evelyn!"

Her family's voices rose in unison.

Fireworks burst across the night sky.

As the lights came back on, Victoria handed Evelyn the cake knife. "Go ahead, cut the cake."

Evelyn took the knife, eyeing the masterpiece before her. She blinked playfully. "It's too beautiful. I can't bring myself to ruin it."

Victoria chuckled fondly. "There will be one every year from now on."

Evelyn grinned, tightened her grip on the knife, and made the first slice.
###Chapter 241

Evelyn's hand trembled slightly as she gripped the cake knife.

The flickering candlelight reflected the complex emotions in her eyes. This was the first time someone had prepared a birthday cake for her.

As the knife pierced the cream, fragmented memories flashed through her mind.

The damp basement. The nights spent starving. The forgotten birthdays in dark corners.

But now, those were all in the past.

"The first slice is for Aunt Victoria." Evelyn handed the cut cake to Victoria Langley with a soft voice.

Next was Richard Langley, followed by her brothers.

When it was Ethan's turn, she deliberately chose the largest piece.

A smile tugged at Ethan's lips as he accepted the plate. His earlier disappointment vanished instantly.

He stared at the noticeably bigger slice, warmth spreading through his chest.

So he still mattered to her.

The cream melted on his tongue, perfectly sweet.

Evelyn took small bites, her eyes curving into crescents.

Waiters brought out dish after dish, each one her favorite. Laughter drifted from the penthouse into the night breeze.

At Beverly Hills, Vincent Sullivan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, lost in thought.

"Old Zhang," he suddenly said, "when do you think Ethan will finally marry Evelyn?"

The butler stifled a chuckle. "Sir, Miss Laurent just turned eighteen."

Vincent sighed heavily.

The legal marriage age loomed like an insurmountable barrier. Two years was too long—too many variables.

His fingers drummed anxiously against the armrest.

"Did Ethan deliver the gift?"

"The young master took it personally," the butler confirmed.

Vincent nodded, but his gaze remained distant.

How he wished he could have seen the girl blowing out her candles.

The butler suppressed a smile at his master's restlessness.

Apart from Ethan, Evelyn was the only one who could make Vincent Sullivan this concerned.

"By the way." Vincent's expression darkened abruptly. "Any movement from Sebastian Royston?"

His voice turned icy.
###Chapter 242

Sebastian Royston, that nephew of his, had finally made his move.

His two elder brothers still coveted the position of Sullivan family patriarch.

Years ago, out of familial mercy, he had spared their lives. Yet they still harbored treacherous ambitions.

The industries in Oklahoma were more than enough to sustain their lavish lifestyles.

But no—

Sebastian had returned to the capital under the pretense of medical treatment and dared to target Ethan Sullivan and Evelyn Laurent!

During the incident in Coastal City, Ethan had already survived one assassination attempt.

Though he emerged unscathed, all evidence pointed to Sebastian's faction in Oklahoma.

Later, Sebastian openly challenged Ethan in the capital.

Ethan hadn't mentioned it, but did the former patriarch truly not know?

He himself had ascended to power through bloodshed—these tactics were all too familiar.

Ethan had inherited his methods flawlessly.

Steward Zhang bowed slightly. "Sebastian made a move against Miss Evelyn in San Francisco. Harrison apprehended him on the spot and delivered him to Dr. Nathaniel's research facility."

Vincent Sullivan smirked. "Good."

Leaning back on the sofa, his presence alone exuded authority. "Daring to touch Evelyn? Let Nathaniel deal with him. Ethan handled this perfectly."

His tone softened. "That shooting range Ethan's been preparing—it's for Evelyn's birthday, isn't it?"

Steward Zhang beamed. "The young master has been overseeing every detail personally. Over a thousand workers are laboring day and night to complete it before Miss Evelyn's birthday."

Vincent laughed heartily.

"That's my boy. Takes after me!"

His smile faded abruptly. Fingering the jade wedding band on his ring finger, his voice grew quiet. "Takes after me in being a hopeless romantic."

The ring gleamed with the soft luster of decades of wear.

"Arianna, our Ethan has finally found the woman he loves." His eyes reddened. "You haven't visited my dreams in so long..."

Steward Zhang murmured gently, "Madam would not wish to see you grieve so. The young master and Miss Evelyn are deeply in love. You should rejoice."

Vincent shook his head. "That rascal—always giving me headaches."

He narrowed his eyes. "He thinks he's hidden it well, that the Laurents don't know about the other woman in his heart. If not for my intervention, the truth would've surfaced long ago."

"Secrets can't stay buried forever." He sighed. "I hope he realizes whether his feelings for Evelyn are genuine... or just guilt over the past."

"If he can't tell the difference—"

Vincent's gaze darkened. "He'll learn the hard way."
###Chapter 243

Sophia Lowell barely dodged the crystal ashtray hurled at her head the moment she pushed open the hospital room door.

The projectile shattered against the wall behind her, scattering shards across the floor.

"Sophia!" Vincent Lowell's roar made the room vibrate. "You blew through ten million in one fucking day?"

Brandon Lowell leaped from the couch, jabbing a finger at her. "You're bankrupting this family!"

Margaret Hill stood by the hospital bed with conflicted eyes. "This spending is excessive, darling."

Sophia slowly removed her sunglasses.

Her fingers trembled as she surveyed the wreckage. Half a second slower, and that would've been her blood splattered on the tiles.

"Since when do I need permission to spend my own money?" Her laugh was ice. "Nobody batted an eye when Evelyn got a three-million-dollar dress."

Silence swallowed the room.

Vincent's face purpled. "That was different! Evelyn—"

"Evelyn this, Evelyn that!" Sophia's voice cracked like a whip. "Where were you when she stole seventeen years of my life?"

The heart monitor screeched an alarm.

Margaret lunged for the nurse call button, but Sophia blocked her.

"Save the act." Sophia eyed her mother's shaking hands. "All you care about is money. Now that Lowell Group's failing, even my breath is a crime, isn't it?"

Brandon grabbed an IV pole. "You ungrateful—"

"Do it!" Sophia tilted her chin up. "Let the world see how the Lowells treat their real daughter."

The pole froze mid-swing.

Outside, clouds swallowed the sunlight, plunging the room into gloom.

Sophia pulled up her phone screen—a bank transfer confirmation. "That ten million bought a guaranteed admission to Juilliard." Her lips curled. "Too bad I don't want it anymore."

Vincent's pupils contracted.

Their last chance at salvation.

"Sophia..." Margaret's voice wavered. "I didn't know—"

"You never do." Sophia yanked the door open. "Just like you don't know Evelyn's buying up Lowell shares right now."

The door slammed shut behind her as glass exploded inside the room.

Down the hall, the nurses' station TV blared entertainment news:
"Rising starlet Evelyn Lowell spotted at NYSE today, signaling business ambitions..."

The elevator doors reflected Sophia's bloodshot eyes as she pressed the button.

Her phone buzzed.

An unknown number sent a photo—Evelyn shaking hands with a bank executive, a "Lowell Group Stock Transfer Agreement" placard in the background.

The elevator chimed open.

Sophia deleted the image and stepped into the blinding white light.
###Chapter 244

The biting wind wrapped around Sophia Lowell's slender frame.

She wandered aimlessly through the streets, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Why?

Why was everyone blaming her? She had only wanted what was best for the Lowell family!

Vincent Lowell's furious shouts still echoed in her ears. Brandon Lowell's icy glare cut through her like a knife.

But what hurt most was Margaret Hill's silence.

Her own mother, who had always doted on her, now chose to stand aside.

Tears blurred her vision. Sophia wiped them away roughly.

"Boom—"

A burst of fireworks suddenly lit up the night sky.

She looked up, the colorful glow reflecting on her pale face.

Laughter drifted from the direction of Symphony Heights.

Sophia's lips twisted into a bitter smile before she vanished into the darkness.

At the penthouse terrace of Symphony Heights, Evelyn Laurent was surrounded by her family.

"Evie, look!" Julian Langley pointed excitedly at the sky. "I specially ordered this fireworks display!"

Sparks formed the words "Happy Birthday" against the night sky.

Evelyn tilted her head back, her eyes sparkling. "Thank you, Julian! It's beautiful!"

Julian leaned in with a mischievous grin. "Now, Evie, out of all the gifts today—excluding Mom and Dad's—which one is your favorite?"

The table fell silent.

Theodore Langley's fork clattered onto his plate.

That dreaded question again!

Last year, his brothers had put him through the same torture on his birthday.

But this time...

He glanced at the sports car keys and limited-edition gaming console he'd gifted, suddenly feeling confident.

Ethan Sullivan's fingers tightened around his wineglass.

He had given her a pair of custom couple's watches, engraved with their initials on the back.

Evelyn's gaze swept across the table—past the stock certificates from Alexander, the jewelry box from Sebastian—before settling on Ethan.

Her lips curved into a radiant smile. "My favorite gift—"

"—is the watch Ethan gave me."

Before she could finish, all four brothers groaned in unison.
###Chapter 245

The six Langley brothers turned in unison, their piercing gazes fixed on Ethan Sullivan.

Victoria Langley's teacup paused mid-air.

Richard Langley arched an eyebrow, surprise flickering in his eyes.

Ethan stood tall, a faint smile playing on his lips. His heart had melted into pure tenderness.

Warmth radiated from his chest, spreading through every limb.

His gaze remained locked on Evelyn, so tender it could drip honey.

"Impossible!" Theodore was the first to leap up. "We never saw you give any gift!"

He scratched his head, utterly baffled by his sister's claim.

The other five brothers darkened, the air around them turning heavy.

Victoria and Richard exchanged a glance, curiosity gleaming in their eyes.

Ethan remained unruffled. "Of course I prepared a gift."

His smile deepened as relief washed over him. Against the Langley brothers' siege, he'd emerged victorious.

Theodore stormed to the pile of presents and flung a document onto the table. "This? Ten mansions and five companies? And Evelyn's favorite?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise. She remembered this extravagant gift clearly, assuming it was from her parents.

Ethan calmly replied, "That wasn't from me."

"Then who?" Theodore's eyes widened.

"A token of appreciation from my father," Ethan said smoothly.

Theodore faltered. No wonder it was so lavish—it came from Mr. Sullivan.

He pressed on stubbornly, "Then where's yours? What did you give her?"

Evelyn's pulse quickened.

The transfer agreement was safely tucked in her bag, its edges pressing into her palm.

"Here," she said softly, unfolding the document. "He gave me a shooting range."

The brothers instantly crowded around.

"Isn't that the old stadium in East District?" Julian exclaimed.

Ethan nodded. "Good memory, Julian."

The abandoned stadium had been purchased overnight and transformed into a professional shooting range.

Alexander's eyes sharpened. "You acquired and renovated it in ten days?"

"How many people can it even hold?" Theodore muttered sourly.

Losing to his brothers was one thing, but to this outsider? Unacceptable.
###Chapter 246

Ethan Sullivan's birthday present unexpectedly became Evelyn Laurent's favorite.

Theodore Langley clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white.

His five brothers glared at Ethan with razor-sharp intensity.

Ethan raised his hands in mock surrender, though his gaze slid toward Evelyn with a hint of vulnerability.

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat.

"It's perfect," she blurted out.

Theodore's expression froze.

His shoulders slumped like a kicked puppy.

Damn it. His baby sister was being stolen.

"We just finished dinner," Evelyn said softly. "Let me show you why."

Aside from her parents' gifts, Ethan's indoor shooting range truly delighted her.

Twenty thousand square meters of pure bliss.

Theodore crushed the transfer agreement in his grip.

The document spelled everything out in black and white.

How the hell had this bastard built such a massive facility in two weeks?

Must be shoddy construction.

Jealousy soured Theodore's stomach.

The Laurents never refused Evelyn's requests.

A motorcade soon rolled out.

Ethan didn't get to ride with Evelyn.

Her six brothers formed a united front, relegating him to the last car.

Watching the Laurent procession ahead, Ethan chuckled wryly.

These overprotective idiots treated him like a thief.

But...

Remembering Evelyn's instant preference for his gift, his lips curved upward.

Exclusion was a small price.

At least she'd chosen him.

That was enough.

For now, he remained an outsider in Evelyn's world.

Her approval alone felt miraculous.

As for those six obsessive brothers...

Ethan narrowed his eyes.

He'd expected the Laurent men to be difficult.

Winning Evelyn would take time.

But securing her heart meant victory over her siblings.

Just like moments ago—

Amusement danced in Ethan's eyes.

Evelyn had instinctively sided with him.

His little firecracker was utterly adorable.
###Chapter 247

The black Maybach glided to a stop before the shooting range entrance.

Evelyn Laurent practically burst from the car, sunlight dancing across her excited face. She linked arms with Victoria Langley while tugging Richard Langley along, skipping toward the entrance.

The six Langley brothers trailed behind like wilted eggplants, their shoulders slumped in defeat.

Ethan Sullivan brought up the rear, an enigmatic smile playing on his lips.

Lights flickered on with an audible snap.

The expansive facility glowed under the bright illumination. To the left lay the shooting range, to the right the archery section. Pristine equipment gleamed under the lights, the air carrying faint traces of leather and metal.

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with unrestrained delight. This was her favorite place to practice moving targets.

"Ethan's gift is my absolute favorite," she announced to her brothers, her voice chiming like wind chimes.

Theodore Langley's expression darkened. He had to admit - Ethan's move was masterful.

The brothers exchanged glances, each mentally kicking themselves for not thinking of this idea first.

Ethan watched Evelyn with tender eyes. Her words made his heart feel dipped in honey.

Victoria and Richard shared a knowing smile. This son-in-law had their full approval.

"Why didn't you tell us you wanted a shooting range?" Theodore grumbled. "We'd have built you a bigger one."

Alexander added calmly, "We could construct one at the estate."

Evelyn shook her head with a laugh. "This one's perfect." She patted her stomach. "Too full from lunch. Shall we work it off?"

The Langley clan sprang into action.

Evelyn's eyes crinkled into crescents as she challenged Ethan to an archery match.

"I'm in too!" Julian called out.

The other brothers quickly joined the competition.

Victoria picked up a pistol and cocked an eyebrow at Richard. "Care for a match, darling?"

Richard smiled indulgently. "You're on."

The couple headed to the shooting range.

At the archery section, Evelyn and Ethan simultaneously drew the heaviest compound bows.

Whoosh!

Two arrows sliced through the air.

Ethan's struck dead center. Evelyn's landed two rings off.

She pouted and nocked another arrow.

The six brothers lined up and released their arrows in unison.

Five found their mark in the bullseye.

One... embedded itself in the wall.
###Chapter 248

Julian Langley's ears burned as his fingers absently stroked the bowstring.

He glared at the untouched target, brows furrowed in frustration.

"This damn bow's defective," he muttered, slamming it onto the ground.

Theodore Langley stifled laughter, shoulders shaking.

His third brother's archery skills were comedy gold.

Nearby, Victoria Langley stamped her foot in frustration.

Three shots fired—her target remained pristine.

Meanwhile Richard Langley hit bullseye after bullseye, preening like a peacock.

"Richard!" Victoria yanked her husband's ear. "Confess. You've been practicing behind my back."

"Mercy, darling!" He winced. "Pure natural talent!"

Regret twisted his gut.

He should've missed on purpose.

Victoria snorted and raised her pistol again.

This time, she redeemed herself.

Laughter filled the shooting range.

The six Langley brothers had vowed to outshoot Ethan Sullivan—only to be humbled by their baby sister Evelyn, the novice.

Their little princess mastered everything with terrifying ease.

During the ride home, Ethan finally got his wish.

With Victoria's tacit approval, Evelyn slid into his Maybach.

Six pairs of murderous eyes glared through the rearview mirror.

The Langley brothers' hearts bled.

Their carefully nurtured rose was being plucked—by this obscenely handsome, filthy rich man who spoiled her rotten.

But—

Brothers-in-law existed solely to be despised!

Especially when their baby sister was still so young!

Ethan was practically a predator!

Six sets of teeth ground together—until Victoria's sharp glance turned them into quailing chicks.

Cool air circulated through the car.

Evelyn dabbed at her flushed face.

"Did you enjoy yourself?" Ethan's voice was velvet.

"Mm!" She nodded emphatically.

Her first real birthday—overflowing with love and surprises.

Including this fiancé who played his role so convincingly.

"Ethan." She spoke suddenly.

"Hm?"

"You don't need to keep up the act anymore."

The steering wheel jerked.

His face darkened instantly.

"Act?"
###Chapter 249

Evelyn Laurent absently fiddled with her seatbelt. "Just get me any random birthday gift."

She turned to face Ethan Sullivan with a serious expression. "We're calling off the engagement eventually anyway. No need to make my brothers hate you more."

The tension at dinner hadn't escaped her notice.

The unspoken hostility between her brothers and Ethan left a bitter taste in her mouth.

Ethan's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel.

A humorless laugh almost escaped him.

"So," his voice turned glacial, "you're saying you don't want my gift?"

Evelyn shrugged. "I don't really care."

Her brothers' gifts already piled up like a mountain at home.

Suddenly remembering something, she added, "Oh, as head of the Sullivan Group, you must be swamped. You should focus on your company."

Ethan's eyes darkened instantly.

He hadn't expected Evelyn to dismiss him so bluntly.

"Evelyn," his voice grew hoarse, "are you pushing me away?"

"Huh?" She blinked in genuine confusion.

The meaning behind his words completely eluded her.

Ethan's fingers tightened until they ached, his chest constricting painfully.

He wanted to say he'd changed his mind about the annulment.

But the words died in his throat.

If he confessed now, this oblivious girl would probably leap from the moving car.

"Listen," he inhaled deeply, "my kindness toward you isn't just for show."

"Celebrating your birthday, preparing gifts—none of this interferes with work."

"My subordinates can handle company matters."

He paused, softening his tone. "I don't... have any special feelings for you."

The moment the lie left his lips, his palms grew damp with nervous sweat.

Evelyn exhaled in visible relief. "Oh thank goodness."

Ethan: "..."

Another arrow pierced his heart.

He finally understood.

This girl's emotional intelligence was catastrophically low.

Once she made up her mind, nothing could change it.

Like that damned annulment decision.

Ethan gritted his teeth.

Conquering this fortress would require a long-term strategy.

He glanced at Evelyn humming cheerfully and sighed inwardly.

Winning her heart might prove harder than negotiating ten international deals.
###Chapter 250

Ethan Sullivan drove Evelyn Laurent to the gates of the Lowell family villa.

He watched her slender figure disappear behind the wrought-iron gates before starting the engine.

The growl of the motor sounded particularly heavy in the night air.

One hand gripped the steering wheel while the other tugged impatiently at his loosened tie.

The rearview mirror reflected his furrowed brow.

At the Sullivan mansion, the butler was polishing an antique vase when he heard the door open.

"Welcome home, young master," he greeted.

Ethan tossed his car keys onto the entryway tray and draped his suit jacket over his arm.

He didn't even look up.

The study door on the second floor suddenly swung open.

Vincent Sullivan stood at the top of the stairs, teacup in hand. His hawk-like gaze gleamed behind his glasses.

"Did she accept the gift?"

"Yeah."

Ethan undid his cufflinks and sank into the leather sofa.

The material creaked faintly under his weight.

Vincent descended slowly, the porcelain cup glowing softly under the chandelier light.

"Judging by your expression, she rejected it?"

"She loved it."

Ethan stared at the crystal chandelier overhead.

The refracted light made his eyes sting.

Vincent sat across from him, studying his son's rare display of emotion with amusement.

"Then why the long face?"

"She said..."

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed. "To stop with the superficial gestures."

An eerie silence fell over the living room.

Vincent nearly choked on his tea.

His shoulders shook with laughter, nearly spilling the drink.

"That girl...has excellent judgment!"

Ethan shot upright.

"Father!"

"Alright, alright."

Vincent wiped his mouth, though his eyes still sparkled with mirth.

"So you've been...friend-zoned?"

The chandelier swayed slightly.

Ethan's composure cracked.

"Keep this up and your future grandson might be a Lowell."

"Then that would mean..."

Vincent took a deliberate sip.

"...my son lacks charm."

The words struck like a dagger.

Ethan clenched his fists.

He remembered the clarity in Evelyn's eyes when she'd said those words in the car earlier.

She truly saw him only as an older brother.

Vincent suddenly sighed.

"Your mother was the same."

His gaze drifted past the floor-to-ceiling windows, as if seeing cherry blossoms from decades past.

"She always called me her most respected elder brother."

Ethan looked up sharply.

"What happened then?"

Vincent traced the rim of his teacup, the celadon glaze reflecting the fine lines at his eyes.

"It took me three years to teach her the difference between a brother and a husband."

His voice softened.

Only the ticking of the antique clock filled the room.

Ethan caught the fleeting glimmer of moisture in his father's eyes.

A pain he'd carried for over twenty years.

"Father..."

Ethan's throat tightened.

"How did you—"

"Listen well, son."

Vincent clapped a heavy hand on his shoulder.

"Persistence wins."

The teacup clinked sharply against the coffee table as he stood.

The chandelier stretched his shadow long across the floor.
###Chapter 251

Ethan Sullivan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, absentmindedly tracing the rim of his glass.

His father's words echoed in his mind.

"Persistence wins?"

His lips twitched, nearly crushing the glass in his grip.

With Evelyn Laurent's fiery temper, if he dared to pester her, she'd probably kick him straight into outer space.

Vincent Sullivan approached with a teacup, speaking earnestly. "That's how I won your mother over."

"Speak your heart. Don't hold back."

"That girl despises liars the most."

Ethan frowned deeply.

Confess?

Tell her he'd loved her since childhood, that he'd been waiting for her all these years?

And cancel that damned engagement contract?

He pictured Evelyn's reaction.

She'd probably punch him square in the face.

"Dad, don't worry about my affairs." Ethan set down his glass and headed upstairs.

Vincent watched his son's retreating figure and sighed.

The boy had none of his father's boldness when it came to pursuing love.

——

After Evelyn's eighteenth birthday, campus life remained uneventful.

Except for the small entourage that now followed her.

Led by Lillian Rothschild, a group of admirers swarmed around her daily, competing to fetch her meals and shower her with snacks.

Evelyn wasn't stingy either, often reciprocating with delicate little gifts.

Meanwhile, Sophia Lowell's followers grew even more attentive.

Lydia Montgomery and her clique stuck to Sophia like shadows.

The most eye-catching was Nigel Winthrop.

The campus heartthrob appeared without fail at the Physics Department entrance every day.

Breakfast, lunch, dinner—plus an array of small surprises.

Their saccharine displays often made passersby groan.

"Ugh. Public displays of affection never last," Lillian would mutter, rolling her eyes each time she saw them.

Isabella Valentine also began appearing around Evelyn frequently.

But the heiress had a peculiar way of giving gifts.

"Bought too much. Can't finish it," she'd say, tossing a carefully prepared breakfast at Evelyn.

Evelyn never refused, often sharing the treats with Lillian and the others.

Gradually, Isabella's image shifted from "haughty heiress" to "tsundere sweetheart" in everyone's eyes.

The only outlier was Ethan.

His appearances grew noticeably scarcer.

What was once a biweekly public lecture became monthly.

He rarely sought Evelyn out anymore.

Evelyn didn't even notice.

She was too busy cramming for finals.

While Lillian and the others scratched their heads over practice problems, Evelyn munched on bread and solved their toughest questions in a few succinct sentences.
###Chapter 252

The streets of Harvard University were adorned with festive lanterns on New Year's Eve.

Department store windows displayed intricate paper-cut decorations.

Joyful holiday music filled every corner of the city.

Evelyn Laurent was organizing her final exam notes in her dorm when her phone buzzed with an earthquake alert.

News of a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Oklahoma flooded the internet.

Her fingers trembled as she clicked on the video footage—collapsed buildings, shattered bridges.

Without hesitation, she immediately authorized a $500 million transfer.

She also instructed Lowell Group to dispatch emergency medical supplies and tents.

"Don't use the company name," she reminded her assistant. "Mark it as an anonymous donation."

The Lowell family patriarch convened an emergency meeting upon hearing the news.

"Allocate $1 billion in cash plus another $500 million in supplies," he declared. "Send them via helicopter."

The Sullivan and Valentine families followed suit, while the Quincy family deployed professional rescue teams.

Harvard's student union quickly organized a fundraising campaign.

In the Physics Department classroom, Lydia Montgomery carried a donation box around.

"Sophia," she leaned toward Sophia Lowell, "how much are you donating?"

Classmates nearby perked up their ears.

"You donated half a million last time for the mountain children."

"This time it must be more, right?"

Sophia's grip on her backpack strap tightened.

Vincent Lowell had recently forced her to hand over $40 million, leaving her nearly broke.

"I..."

Lillian Rothschild entered through the back door with textbooks in hand and smirked.

"Can't even afford to donate now?"

"Shut up!" Lydia snapped. "Sophia just hasn't decided on the amount yet!"

Lillian leisurely pulled out her phone.

"I just transferred $200,000 to the Red Cross."

She waved the confirmation screen.

"If someone can't afford it, just say so?"

The classroom fell dead silent.

Every eye locked onto Sophia's pale face.
###Chapter 253

"You!"

Lydia Montgomery trembled with rage, her finger jabbing accusingly at Lillian Rothschild.

Lillian's words were clearly mocking her for pretending to be something she wasn't.

Gritting her teeth, Lydia sneered, "Lillian Rothschild, what a loyal little lapdog you are. Barking before your master even gives the command."

Lillian arched a brow, unfazed. "I'm proud to be Sister Evelyn's lapdog. But you—understanding a dog's bark so well—does that make you Sophia Lowell's pet? Always snapping at people."

A smug smile played on her lips.

Evelyn Laurent was everything—gracious, kind, and genuine. Unlike Sophia Lowell, who put on airs at every turn.

Lydia hadn't expected Lillian to own the insult so boldly, making her own pettiness glaringly obvious.

What stung worse was that she couldn't match Lillian's donation.

Lillian cast a dismissive glance at Sophia and drawled, "Careful. Wouldn't want that bravado to burst like an overinflated balloon."

With that, she turned on her heel and strode away, leaving them fuming.

Sophia clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

Lydia shot a venomous glare at Lillian's retreating figure before sidling up to Sophia. "Sophia, they're just jealous of your family's status—"

"Enough!" Sophia screamed internally.

This idiot had no tact whatsoever.

Lillian's words carried an underlying meaning—did she know something?

Sophia's mind raced, but she forced a composed smile. "Lydia, donations are personal. There's no need for comparisons."

Her heart ached. Why should she donate a single penny to some earthquake in Oklahoma? Every cent in her private fund was precious.

Lydia finally shut up, but Sophia's strained smile was painfully obvious.

Meanwhile, Lillian sidled up to Evelyn, gleeful. "Sister Evelyn, wanna bet how much Sophia donated?"

Evelyn didn't even spare a glance, scoffing. "How much could a miser possibly part with?"

"Evelyn Laurent!" Lydia shot to her feet. "How dare you look down on Sophia!"

Sophia wanted to strangle this useless ally.

Evelyn's gaze turned icy. "I do look down on her. What are you going to do about it?"

Lydia froze.
###Chapter 254

Evelyn Laurent's gaze was like a sharp blade, piercing straight into Lydia Montgomery's heart.

Lydia felt a chill run down her spine. Her legs trembled weakly.

She opened her mouth, but no words came out.

The classroom was eerily silent.

"We're classmates... Don't go too far." Lydia's voice was barely a whisper. She immediately lowered her head, wishing she could disappear under the desk.

Regret washed over her.

Why had she provoked this madwoman?

What if Evelyn actually attacked her?

Lydia's palms were slick with cold sweat.

Evelyn curled her lips in disdain. Her eyes lingered on Sophia Lowell for a brief second before shifting away.

The classroom soon buzzed with noise again.

Class president Sophia was organizing a charity donation for disaster relief.

She held the Physics Department's dedicated donation card as students transferred funds one after another.

Evelyn tapped on her phone without hesitation and transferred 100 million.

This wasn't for show.

Isabella Valentine had donated 200 million, and other wealthy classmates were also giving generously.

Sophia's heart raced as she watched the account balance skyrocket.

400 million.

A full 400 million.

Her fingers trembled slightly.

So much money...

Sophia took a deep breath, forcing herself to stay calm.

The transaction record only showed surnames.

That glaring "Lowell" surname made her burn with envy.

It must have been Ethan Sullivan's money.

Why?

Why did Evelyn get so much?

While she had only donated one million.

Sophia's eyes flickered with unease.

"Wow! Sophia, you donated 100 million?!"

Lydia suddenly shrieked.

Sophia's hand jerked, nearly dropping her phone.

She frantically tried to stop her, but it was too late.

The classroom erupted in chaos.

"Sophia is amazing!"

"Some people still dare to look down on her?"

"Exactly! Sophia is the most generous!"

Amid the endless praise, no one noticed Sophia's pale face.

These idiots...

Sophia clenched her phone so tightly her knuckles turned white.
###Chapter 255

Sophia Lowell clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms. She forced a smile, but her gaze kept drifting toward Evelyn Laurent.

The murmurs around them were impossible to miss. Evelyn must have heard everything.

The one who donated 100 million was Evelyn. With that bitch's temper, she would have exposed Sophia on the spot!

But Evelyn only gave her an amused glance before looking away.

Lillian Rothschild opened her mouth to speak, but Evelyn subtly tugged her sleeve, silencing her.

Sophia's racing heart finally settled.

A wild thought crossed her mind—what if the bank had made a mistake and credited someone else's donation to Evelyn?

The possibility made her relax completely.

If Evelyn had really donated that much, she would have already slapped Sophia across the face.

Maybe the mysterious donor was someone else entirely.

A smug smile crept onto Sophia's lips.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was typing a message to Dr. Gregory Evans on her phone.

She suggested holding an awards ceremony for the top donor and inviting their parents.

Dr. Evans immediately began compiling the list. But when he saw Sophia's name, he frowned. "She only donated one million."

Evelyn tapped her screen. "Just proceed as planned, Headmaster."

Two hours later, whispers filled the Physics Department classroom.

"Sophia donated 100 million? That's incredible!"
"I never knew she was this humble..."

Students crowded around Sophia, showering her with flattery.

Evelyn watched coldly, a mocking smile on her lips.

Did stolen glory taste that sweet?

First, she faked screenshots. Now, she was stealing credit for donations.

Evelyn couldn't wait to see how Sophia would handle what was coming.

When the bell rang, an announcement blared through the speakers. "All students, please assemble on the field for the Philanthropy Awards Ceremony."

Sophia's face turned deathly pale.

Lydia Montgomery excitedly grabbed her arm. "Sophia, you're definitely going on stage to accept the award!"

Sophia trembled, forcing a smile that looked more like a grimace.
###Chapter 256

Who the hell came up with this ridiculous awards ceremony?

She had only donated one million. Where did this hundred million figure come from?

Sophia Lowell stomped her feet in frustration, nails digging deep into her palms.

Yet she forced a polite smile onto her face.

Meanwhile, a black luxury sedan glided into Harvard University.

Vincent Lowell sat in a wheelchair, Brandon Lowell leaning on a cane, while Margaret Hill pushed the wheelchair. All three wore expectant smiles.

They had been invited by the university to attend their daughter's awards ceremony.

"I heard Sophia donated quite a sum?" Vincent murmured with satisfaction.

Margaret nodded eagerly. "The university said it was a significant amount."

Brandon's grip on his cane trembled. "Our Sophia has really made us proud."

As soon as they stepped onto the field, a staff member approached.

"Mr. Lowell and family? Please follow me."

They were escorted to the VIP section at the front.

Vincent's eyes widened.

They were seated right beside the Langley family!

Richard Langley and Victoria Langley sat regally in the center, flanked by their six sons like a constellation of stars.

Vincent nearly rose from his wheelchair in excitement.

"Mr. Langley, I'm—"

Before he could finish, icy glares pierced him.

The entire Langley family turned in unison, their gazes sharp as blades.

The air froze instantly.

Cold sweat trickled down Vincent's back, but he stiffened his spine.

Sitting beside the Langley patriarch—what an honor!

He adjusted his collar smugly, his resentment toward his daughter fading slightly.

But Margaret stared fixedly at Victoria's profile.

That face... Why did it look so much like Evelyn Laurent?

A chill ran through her. Her fingers trembled uncontrollably.
###Chapter 257

Margaret Hill's pupils constricted sharply. Her fingernails dug into her palms unconsciously.

An absurd thought exploded in her mind.

Could Evelyn Laurent be Victoria Langley's daughter?

She shook her head violently, leaving crescent-shaped marks on her palms.

Impossible.

That wretched girl's records clearly stated her parents were country bumpkins.

How could a prestigious family like the Langleys have rural roots?

Margaret took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down.

She must be overthinking things because of Evelyn's recent antics.

Smoothing her dress, she sat gracefully beside Vincent Lowell, her eyes gleaming with anticipation.

This was Harvard University's Awards Ceremony.

Only a select few parents received invitations.

And they were seated right beside the Langley family.

What did that signify?

Margaret's lips curved upward involuntarily.

Sophia had truly brought honor to the Lowell name this time.

The sound of footsteps grew louder across the field.

Sophia Lowell walked amidst the crowd, her face as pale as paper.

A sense of impending doom weighed on her.

But Lydia Montgomery and her clique clung to her like glue, leaving no chance to escape.

When she spotted Vincent in the audience, her blood ran cold.

Even worse—

Richard Langley sat right beside her father!

Victoria Langley sipped tea elegantly.

Behind her stood six imposing figures—the Langley brothers.

Sophia's legs trembled, barely supporting her weight.

She bit her lower lip hard to stifle a scream.

"Sophia, look!" Lydia tugged her arm excitedly. "Your whole family came!"

"This ceremony must be for you!"

"How enviable..."

The sycophantic chatter around her stabbed at Sophia's heart like knives.

She stood frozen, struggling to breathe.

Isabella Valentine strode past in stilettos.

Her red lips curled into a mocking smirk as she headed toward the Valentine seating.

"Harvard suddenly holding an awards ceremony?" Oliver Valentine frowned.

Isabella lounged in her seat, amusement glinting in her eyes. "Just wait for the show."

The field gradually filled with attendees.

Countless curious gazes lingered on the Langley family.

Whispers rippled through the crowd:

"Which elite family is that?"

"Are those Sophia Lowell's parents in the middle?"

"Those six gorgeous men behind them must be her brothers. Unbelievable..."
###Chapter 258

Sunlight streamed through the chapel's stained glass, casting a glow on Sophia Lowell's pale face. She stood at the center of the crowd, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her dress.

Evelyn Laurent leaned against the wall, a faint smirk playing on her lips. She idly twirled a strand of hair, but her gaze remained locked on Sophia.

"Word is you're the seventh daughter of the Lowell family?" Evelyn's voice floated over, sharp as a blade.

Sophia's breath hitched.

Dr. Gregory Evans' voice cut through the tension. "Second place in the charity fundraiser—Sophia Lowell from the Physics Department."

The room fell silent.

Sophia felt the weight of countless stares like spotlights. She saw Vincent Lowell's eyes redden with emotion, while Lydia Montgomery frantically signaled at her.

"Sophia, go up there!" Someone nudged her forward.

Her legs felt like lead, each step an agonizing effort. The air in the chapel thickened, making it hard to breathe.

Sophia bit her lower lip hard. She suddenly realized she stood at a crossroads in her life.

One wrong move, and everything would crumble.

She took a deep breath and made her decision.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Sophia walked straight to Richard Langley and Victoria Langley. Her voice was barely a whisper. "Dad. Mom."

Then she turned to the six young men behind them. "Brothers."

Victoria's eyes turned icy.

"Whose daughter is this?" Her voice rang clear and mocking. "My daughter is far more beautiful than you."

Sophia froze as if struck by lightning.

She saw Vincent lurch up from his wheelchair, Lydia covering her mouth in shock. The chapel fell into stunned silence, everyone reeling from the sudden turn of events.

"I—" Sophia opened her mouth, but no sound came out.

Victoria rose gracefully, looking down at her with disdain. "So young, yet already scheming to claim relations? The Langley family doesn't open its doors to just any stray."

Evelyn let out a quiet laugh from the corner.

Sophia's world spun. She finally understood—the carefully woven lie had unraveled completely.
###Chapter 259

Victoria Langley's words pierced through Sophia Lowell's facade like a dagger.

Her fingernails dug into her palms, but she felt no pain.

"You—" Margaret Hill began to retort when Sophia yanked her sleeve.

Victoria curled her lips in disdain. "What's wrong? Scared now?"

A commotion erupted from the audience.

"Impossible!" Nigel Winthrop shot up from his seat, his chair screeching across the floor.

His burning gaze locked onto Sophia, fury blazing in his eyes.

Lydia Montgomery's drink clattered to the ground.

She suddenly remembered Sophia's enigmatic smile whenever the Lowells were mentioned.

"You deceived us all!" someone shouted angrily.

Victoria advanced slowly, her stilettos tapping a menacing rhythm.

"Who gave you the audacity to impersonate a Lowell heiress?"

Vincent Lowell's face turned ashen as he pointed a trembling finger at Sophia. "Do you realize you've endangered the entire family?"

The crowd exploded.

"Those donation records must be fake!"

"Give back my limited-edition bag!"

"Investigate all her financial sources!"

The uproar grew louder. Sophia staggered back two steps.

Her lips parted, but no sound came out.

Victoria smirked and unlocked her phone. "Shall I play your chat logs with those sugar daddies for everyone?"

The final blow landed.

Sophia's legs gave way, and she collapsed onto the stage.

Her carefully constructed lies crumbled to dust in that moment.
###Chapter 260

Sophia Lowell's tears spilled over as her entire body trembled like a leaf in the wind.

She knew she was finished.

Utterly and completely finished.

Those who had once flattered her now rushed to trample her underfoot.

Why?

They were the ones who had insisted she was the seventh daughter of the Lowell family!

"Sophia Lowell, you—!"

Vincent Lowell's fingers shook violently, his voice thick with barely contained fury.

He didn't even dare glance at Richard Langley's expression.

This audacious girl had dared to impersonate the seventh daughter of the Lowell family at Harvard University!

Even worse, she had been exposed in front of the entire faculty, student body, and the Lowell family!

His wheelchair lurched forward as Vincent raised his hand and struck Sophia across the face.

Slap!

The sharp sound of the blow echoed through the auditorium.

Sophia staggered back, a trickle of blood seeping from her lip before she collapsed to the floor in disgrace.

"Apologize now!" Vincent's voice was a low growl of suppressed rage.

His chest ached so fiercely he could barely breathe.

Clutching her cheek, Sophia knelt on the ground, sobbing. "I'm sorry... But I never claimed to be her! They were the ones who assumed it!"

"It's all their fault!"

Lydia Montgomery exploded at those words.

She couldn't accept that she had bet on the wrong horse.

To curry favor with Sophia, she had alienated Isabella Valentine—and now she had offended the Lowells too?

"Sophia, have you no shame?" Lydia's face twisted into a hysterical snarl. "You were the one dropping hints! The penthouse at Symphony Heights, the forged donation records—all you!"

Dr. Gregory Evans added coldly, "The donation records were indeed falsified. Sophia wasn't even the second-highest donor."

Lydia shrieked, "She forged them herself!"

Then her voice cut off abruptly.

As if struck by a horrifying realization, she turned stiffly toward Evelyn Laurent, her voice trembling. "E-Evelyn... That hundred-million donation—was it yours?"

Evelyn stood at the center of the crowd, a cold smile curling her lips. "Yes."

Only two students in the Physics Department shared the surname Laurent.

The answer was undeniable.

Lydia stumbled back, her face ashen. "So... you're the real seventh daughter of the Lowell family?"

"We were all fooled! Ha! Every single one of us—by Sophia!"

Her hysterical laughter broke off as her eyes rolled back, and she collapsed to the floor.

"Call the medics! Someone fainted!"

Chaos erupted in the hall.

But Lydia's words detonated like a bomb among the crowd.

Evelyn Laurent... was the true seventh daughter of the Lowell family?!
###Chapter 261

Sophia Lowell's pupils constricted violently.

She whipped her head toward Evelyn Laurent, her fingers trembling uncontrollably.

Evelyn stood bathed in the spotlight, her icy demeanor a stark contrast to the boisterous crowd. A faint smirk played on her lips, her mocking gaze cutting through Sophia like a knife.

That face—bearing an uncanny resemblance to Victoria Langley—was now unbearably painful to behold.

Sophia's world spun.

"This can't be..." she whispered, nails digging deep into her palms.

All this time, she'd been the fool.

Evelyn had known everything, silently watching her pathetic performance. Those meaningful glances, those loaded silences—they were all taunts!

"Evelyn Laurent!" Sophia's voice cracked with hysteria. "You've been playing me?"

She remembered Evelyn's amused smirk when she'd proudly claimed to be the seventh Langley heiress. Humiliation crashed over her in waves.

Vincent Lowell and his family turned ashen.

Vincent trembled in his wheelchair, lips quivering wordlessly. The adopted daughter they'd cast out was the true Langley princess!

Everything made sense now.

The sudden misfortunes, the mysterious setbacks...

Evelyn strode toward the podium.

Victoria and Richard Langley immediately rose to greet her. The six Langley brothers stood in unison, their gazes warm with affection.

When Evelyn took her place beside Victoria, the audience gasped.

The mother and daughter shared identical poise and features—more convincing than any DNA test.

Lillian Rothschild smiled approvingly. Students who'd opposed Evelyn now paled.

"Enjoying the show, brother?" Isabella Valentine swirled her wine glass.

Oliver Valentine scoffed. "That impostor should've been exposed ages ago."

The room erupted.

"My God! Evelyn is the real heiress!"
"How dare Sophia pretend to be her!"
"No wonder Evelyn never bothered to explain..."

The whispers crashed over Sophia like tidal waves.

She stood frozen, mind blank.

Evelyn calmly displayed her phone. The donation records on screen burned into everyone's retinas.

"These are the authentic records." Her voice was glacial. "Sophia's were forged."
###Chapter 262

"That hundred-million-dollar donation came from me."

Evelyn Laurent's lips curved slightly, her gaze sharp as a blade piercing through Sophia Lowell.

"I've given you too many chances."

Her voice was soft, yet every word struck like a dagger.

Sophia's face turned deathly pale, her nails digging deep into her palms.

She refused to accept this!

How could Evelyn be the seventh daughter of the Lowell family?

How could she possess so much evidence?

"Harvard University does not tolerate academic fraud."

Dr. Gregory Evans announced impassively, "Per the board's decision, Sophia Lowell's exchange student status is revoked. She will be expelled immediately."

Sophia trembled violently, her legs buckling beneath her.

Expelled?

Vincent Lowell's face darkened with rage, his finger shaking as he pointed at Sophia.

"You... you—"

Before he could finish, his eyes rolled back, and he collapsed to the floor.

"This is all your fault, you bitch!"

Brandon Lowell snatched his cane and swung it at Sophia.

"Evelyn is my real sister! You did this!"

The cane struck Sophia with a sickening thud.

"Evelyn! Mommy was wrong!"

Margaret Hill suddenly lunged toward Evelyn, tears streaming down her face.

"I shouldn't have listened to lies and driven you away—"

She reached for Evelyn's pant leg.

"Get away from her!"

Victoria Langley kicked Margaret square in the chest.

"Now you want to claim her as your daughter?"

Her eyes were as sharp as steel.

"Did you think about this when you abandoned her in the countryside ten years ago?"

Victoria's voice rang out sharply, "Guards! Escort this entire family to the police station!"

The crowd gasped.

The usually elegant Mrs. Langley now radiated an unshakable authority.

Ethan Sullivan stood in the corner, a faint smile touching his lips.

His girl was finally letting her brilliance shine.
###Chapter 263

Security guards rushed to the scene.

Brandon Lowell continued screaming hysterically at Evelyn Laurent. "Sister! Sophia Lowell forced me into this!"

Even though he despised her.

Now that he knew she was the true seventh daughter of the Langley family, he had to cling to this lifeline.

What if it worked?

The response didn't come from Evelyn.

Theodore Langley strode forward and delivered a stinging slap across his face.

"How dare you call her 'sister'? Get lost!"

Theodore was seething with rage.

This disgusting creature actually dared to claim kinship with Evelyn.

The audacity!

Brandon and Margaret Hill were dragged away by security, still wailing like banshees.

They only quieted down after being gagged with cloth.

As for Vincent Lowell, the university had already prepared a medical team.

He was immediately loaded into an ambulance and taken away.

Sophia slumped on the stage.

Not far away stood Evelyn and her family.

The sight was enough to drive her mad with envy.

The crowd below was furious.

"Sophia Lowell, get out of Harvard!" The chants rose like waves.

People began throwing objects at her.

Stones and water bottles pelted her body.

"Imposter!"

"Who do you think you are?"

"Leave Harvard now!"

The torrent of insults was relentless.

Evelyn watched coldly.

Sophia had brought this upon herself.

Greed always leads to downfall.

Sophia suddenly lifted her head, her eyes filled with venom. "Evelyn Laurent, you must be loving this, aren't you?"

She had driven Evelyn out of the Langley family.

There was no way Evelyn didn't hate her.

Evelyn smirked disdainfully. "Indeed. Watching you suffer brings me great joy."

"Your acting was laughably pathetic."

Sophia clenched her fists.

Out of the corner of her eye, she spotted Ethan Sullivan standing nearby.

She knew it was over.

But if she was going down, she'd drag Evelyn with her.

"Evelyn."

A twisted smile curled her lips. "Did you know Ethan Sullivan is actually..."
###Chapter 264

Sophia Lowell's shrill voice echoed across the field.

Her venomous gaze locked onto Ethan Sullivan as a cruel smirk twisted her lips. "You were never the one in his heart."

"Evelyn Laurent, do you really think he loves you?"

"You're just a stand-in!"

Victoria Langley trembled with rage and delivered a sharp slap across Sophia's face.

Crack!

The crisp sound silenced the entire crowd.

Ethan's face drained of color before quickly regaining composure. A flicker of lethal intent flashed in his eyes as his fists clenched at his sides.

Sophia was determined to burn everything down with her.

The six Langley brothers turned their piercing gazes toward Ethan, their eyes sharp as blades.

"Hahaha!" Sophia clutched her cheek, laughing hysterically.

She wanted to see the Langleys humiliated.

She wanted to watch Evelyn suffer.

Why should they have everything while she had nothing?

"Mom, ignore her," Evelyn said softly, gently pulling Victoria's hand away. "A rabid dog will bite anyone."

Her calm gaze swept over Ethan. "You know exactly what kind of man Mr. Sullivan is."

Victoria took a deep breath, forcing her anger down.

Ethan strode forward, his presence icy. "Security."

Two guards immediately seized Sophia.

As she was dragged away, Sophia mouthed a silent phrase at Evelyn.

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

The field fell deathly quiet.

Every ear strained to catch the next words.

This was explosive gossip about the Sullivan Group's CEO!

"Tch." Lillian Rothschild suddenly scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "People actually believe Sophia's nonsense?"

She scanned the crowd with mocking amusement. "Taking the ravings of an impostor seriously? How pathetic."

The onlookers exchanged glances, realization dawning.

Right!

How could anyone trust the words of a proven fraud?

Sophia was truly vicious—dragging others down with her even in defeat.
###Chapter 265

Ethan Sullivan secretly exhaled in relief at Lillian Rothschild's words.

Evelyn Laurent's earlier defense had clearly been protecting him.

The Langley family's expressions softened slightly.

Ethan quickly moved to Evelyn's side, addressing Victoria Langley and the others with quiet resignation. "My devotion to Evelyn is absolute."

His tone carried unmistakable sincerity.

He hadn't caught Sophia Lowell's final whisper to Evelyn—deliberately meant for her ears alone.

Evelyn's brow furrowed as she studied Ethan pensively.

Sophia claimed Ethan's heart belonged to her?

How could that be?

Ethan was the sole heir of Vincent Sullivan, former patriarch of the Sullivan dynasty in the capital.

She'd grown up in a coastal city before being sent to the countryside.

Their paths had never crossed.

Though Lillian dismissed Sophia's words as lies, they burned into Evelyn's mind like a brand.

Impossible to ignore.

Still, she quickly composed herself.

She'd find a chance to question Ethan privately.

Her contemplative gaze made Ethan tense.

But she soon looked away.

News of Sophia's expulsion exploded across Harvard's campus forums, becoming prime gossip material.

Evelyn's true identity as the seventh Langley heiress also dominated conversations.

Everyone marveled at Victoria and Richard Langley's exceptional genes.

Their six sons were extraordinary, and Evelyn's talents spoke for themselves.

Admitted to Harvard without standardized testing.

A showstopping dance performance at the Centennial Gala.

Coupled with her striking beauty, she was unanimously crowned campus queen—an idol to countless admirers.

The awards ceremony resumed after the Sophia incident, proceeding without further disruption.

Afterward, Evelyn waved goodbye to Lillian and left with her parents and brothers.

Ethan followed silently.

He felt compelled to explain today's events.

Otherwise...

Unease gnawed at him.

Seated in the passenger seat, Ethan kept his eyes locked on the Langley's car ahead.

Upon arriving at Beverly Hills, he was intercepted by Alexander Langley the moment he stepped out.

Alexander's piercing gaze radiated icy authority. "It's late. We won't entertain guests now."

His controlled tone barely masked the storm beneath.

Ethan's stomach dropped.

Victoria glanced back at him hesitantly before guiding Evelyn inside.

Ethan pressed his lips together. "I wanted—"

"Mr. Sullivan."

Alexander cut him off sharply.

His commanding presence rivaled Ethan's own.

"Leave." The quiet command brooked no argument.
###Chapter 266

Ethan Sullivan's figure disappeared at the end of the hallway.

Alexander Langley stared at the closed elevator doors, his gaze icy cold.

He turned and slammed the front door shut with such force that the vase in the foyer trembled.

The air in the living room instantly turned heavy.

Evelyn Laurent sensed something was wrong. Her eyes darted between her family members.

Her eldest brother had clearly been making excuses to get rid of Ethan.

It was only six in the evening—what did he mean by "it's getting late"?

Suddenly, Sophia's words flashed through her mind, making her heart skip a beat.

Victoria Langley set down her teacup with a sharp clink.

"Evelyn," she said, her voice low. "What exactly is going on between you and Ethan?"

Alexander leaned back on the sofa, his long fingers tapping the armrest.

"The Sullivans have stubbornly refused to break off the engagement all these years. That's suspicious enough." His eyes narrowed. "If he's really got someone else in his heart—"

He didn't finish, but the implication was clear.

Before Evelyn could respond, Victoria sighed.

"I think Ethan does have feelings for someone."

All six brothers shot to their feet, their fists clenched tight.

"He wouldn't dare!" Julian Langley yanked at his tie. "I'll break his legs right now!"

Dominic already had the fruit knife from the coffee table in hand.

"Sit down, all of you!" Victoria smacked the table. "I meant Evelyn!"

The room fell silent.

"Haven't you noticed?" Victoria gave her sons an exasperated look. "All the gifts Ethan's been giving Evelyn lately are tailored to her tastes."

"Shooting range passes, concert tickets—even that limited-edition fountain pen last time."

The tips of Evelyn's ears turned pink.

Alexander scoffed. "That doesn't prove—"

"Prove what?" Victoria cut him off. "Your sister's eyes light up every time she mentions him. Are you blind?"

Evelyn abruptly covered her face with her hands.

The six brothers exchanged glances, their aggressive stance deflating instantly.
###Chapter 267

Victoria Langley crossed her arms, glaring at her six foolish sons with exasperation.

And one foolish daughter.

Evelyn Laurent felt utterly bewildered. The situation was spiraling out of control.

If she was hearing this correctly...

Did Ethan Sullivan actually have feelings for her?

Why else would he dote on her and gift her such expensive presents?

But...

Evelyn couldn't forget Ethan's words.

He was waiting for someone.

The girl who had been kidnapped with him.

He had sworn they would break off their engagement.

Hadn't he loved that girl? Why was it suddenly her?

Evelyn couldn't make sense of it.

Her chest tightened like a stone weighed on her heart.

She lowered her head in silence.

The tension in the living room eased as the six Langley brothers relaxed.

The air remained heavy for a long moment.

Finally, Victoria broke the silence. "Everyone, get some rest. I trust Ethan."

She turned to Evelyn, her gaze softening. "Evelyn, do you love him?"

The question carried gravity.

Though the engagement had lasted years, Victoria had witnessed Ethan's devotion to Evelyn.

But what mattered most was her daughter's heart.

She needed to know if Evelyn truly loved Ethan.

She wanted her to follow her heart and be with someone she genuinely cherished.

Evelyn rarely showed uncertainty, but now she hesitated before whispering, "Mom... I don't know."

Strictly speaking, she had only known Ethan for half a year.

She had only returned to the Langley family six months ago.

Before that, she hadn't even understood familial love—let alone romance.

She couldn't define her feelings for Ethan.

Love?

She didn't even know what love meant. But being with Ethan felt... comfortable.

Victoria wasn't surprised by her answer.

She gently ruffled Evelyn's hair. "You're still young, sweetheart. There's no need to rush. But if Ethan ever hurts you, promise you'll tell me."

Richard Langley added firmly, "Evelyn, always protect yourself."

"Your mother and I would never force you into a marriage you don't want. You're not a pawn for alliances, so don't pressure yourself."

Evelyn's nose stung.

She had feared becoming a sacrificial lamb for the family's interests. After all, arranged marriages were common among elites like the Langleys.

Hadn't Ethan initially kept their engagement to avoid another match?

The thought tangled her emotions further.

But she masked it well, offering a faint smile. "I understand, Dad."

Straightening her posture, she declared with pride, "Don't worry. No one can bully me."

Anyone who tried would learn the meaning of absolute power.
###Chapter 268

Victoria Langley and Richard Langley exchanged a knowing smile as they watched Evelyn Laurent's confident demeanor.

The tense expressions on Alexander Langley and his brothers' faces gradually relaxed.

"Evelyn, promise you'll tell us if anything happens." Alexander ruffled her hair, his voice tender yet firm.

Warmth blossomed in Evelyn's chest.

This was what real family felt like.

They stood in stark contrast to Vincent Lowell's household - always having her back, protecting her unconditionally.

This warmth was slowly melting the ice around her heart.

Her fingers curled into determined fists.

She would hold onto this family with everything she had.

Back in her bedroom, Evelyn's thoughts drifted unbidden to Ethan Sullivan.

What exactly were his feelings for her?

The question kept her tossing and turning.

She strained to recall details of that kidnapping incident, but the memories remained frustratingly elusive.

Meanwhile, in Alexander's room.

The blue glow of his computer screen illuminated his grim expression.

"Find out who Ethan's true love is." His voice turned icy as he issued the command through the phone. "Immediately."

He wouldn't tolerate anyone hurting his sister.

Next door, Victoria's composed mask slipped the moment she closed the door.

"We need to uncover why Ethan hasn't called off the engagement." Her voice held a dangerous edge.

Sophia Lowell's earlier comment had allowed her to catch Ethan's fleeting moment of panic.

Though Ethan's affection for Evelyn seemed genuine, what if...

What if Evelyn was merely a substitute?

Richard embraced his wife gently. "Don't worry too much. Ethan isn't that kind of man."

"He's not an ordinary man." Victoria's eyes turned sharp.

Both knew the blood staining Ethan's hands from claiming the Sullivan family's leadership.

Sleep would elude them tonight.

Evelyn restlessly pondered Ethan in her bed.

Alexander investigated through the night.

His five brothers each pursued their own leads.

Richard deployed his most elite intelligence operatives.

As for Ethan...

Staring at the ceiling, an overwhelming unease gripped him.

All of it traced back to Sophia's fatal words.
###Chapter 269

Ethan Sullivan stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, cigarette ash crumbling from his fingertips.

The image of Sophia Lowell's deceitful face flashed in his mind, his eyes turning glacial.

"Prepare the car."

His voice was icy as he spoke through the intercom.

Thirty minutes later, in the CEO's office of Sullivan Group.

"I want the Lowell Corporation wiped out within three days." Ethan slammed a file onto the desk. "And notify all our partners—anyone who aids the Lowells will be considered an enemy of Sullivan Group."

His assistant broke into a cold sweat. "Understood, Mr. Sullivan."

The hospital room reeked of antiseptic.

Vincent Lowell's eyes snapped open, his chest heaving.

"Father!" Brandon Lowell rushed to the bedside, fury still etched on his face.

A faint sob came from the corner.

Sophia huddled against the wall, her expensive dress in tatters, bruises mottling her exposed skin.

"Where is that bitch?" Vincent rasped.

Brandon yanked Sophia by her hair, dragging her to the bed.

Sophia gasped in pain.

"Look what you've done!" Vincent hurled a glass at her. "You've disgraced the Lowell name!"

Shards sliced her cheek, leaving a trail of blood.

Margaret Hill watched coldly. "We should've left you to rot in that orphanage."

Sophia trembled violently.

A month ago, she'd been the envy of high society—the beloved Lowell heiress.

"I... I didn't mean to..." she choked out.

"Shut up!" Brandon kicked her in the stomach. "If you hadn't impersonated the real Lowell daughter, we wouldn't be ruined!"

Sophia curled into a ball, agony searing through her.

She remembered Evelyn Laurent's mocking gaze.

The true seventh daughter of the Lowells must be laughing at her downfall.

"Now all of Boston knows we raised an imposter." Vincent coughed violently. "Our stocks crashed. Creditors are pounding on our doors!"

The hospital door burst open.

Black-suited bodyguards filed in.

"By Mr. Sullivan's orders, the Lowells are to leave Boston immediately." The lead guard's voice was flat. "Or else..."

His gaze lingered on the trembling Sophia.

Vincent's face turned ashen.

He knew—the Lowells were finished.
###Chapter 270

Sophia Lowell's voice now triggered a conditioned fear response in him.

His body tensed involuntarily every time he heard it.

He braced himself for another earth-shattering revelation.

Sophia wisely pressed her lips together.

Then—

BANG!

The hospital door was kicked open violently.

A dozen men in black filed in wordlessly and immediately began attacking.

"What are you doing? This is a hospital!"

"Help! Security! Where are the guards?"

"Ah! My leg!"

Screams erupted one after another.

The assailants specifically targeted Brandon Lowell and Margaret Hill.

Sophia was already bruised and battered—they feared further blows might kill her.

Ten minutes later.

The four were tossed out of the hospital entrance like garbage.

"Scum like you aren't welcome in Harvard City," the lead enforcer said coldly. "Leave by sundown, or else—"

His knuckles cracked ominously.

The threat was unmistakable.

Vincent Lowell's face darkened with rage, his nails digging into his palms.

Yet he forced an ingratiating smile. "We're leaving right now—right now..."

His legs were useless.

He couldn't afford to lose his life too.

"What are you standing around for?" Vincent snarled at Sophia. "Carry me!"

Gritting her teeth, Sophia bent down with trembling limbs.

The moment she hoisted Vincent onto her back, her vision blurred.

Was this the elite life she'd dreamed of?

Once, Vincent had looked at her with pride.

When she got into Harvard University, the whole family celebrated her.

Now?

She was just a human crutch.

A punching bag.

Sophia bit her lower lip until it bled.

Was all of this really her fault?

If only they'd treated Evelyn Laurent better...

If they hadn't been so shallow...

She crushed the thought before it fully formed.

She would never admit that country girl was superior.

Never.
###Chapter 271

The Lowell family hastily packed their belongings under cover of darkness and fled Capital City in disgrace.

No sooner had they crossed the city limits than three black SUVs surrounded them.

"Well, if it isn't Mr. Lowell," sneered a thickset man stepping from a vehicle, his leather shoes sinking into the muddy road. "Running away like a whipped dog?"

Vincent Lowell trembled so violently his wheelchair nearly overturned.

He recognized the man—loan shark Hugo Maddox.

"M-Mr. Maddox..." Vincent forced a grimace worse than a sob. "What brings you here—"

Hugo kicked the wheelchair, sending it lurching. "Six months I've hunted you! Five million plus interest—settle up today!"

Sophia Lowell cowered behind her mother, only to be yanked forward by two brutes.

"Not bad," Hugo gripped Sophia's chin, forcing her swollen face upward. "Punched-up face but a killer body."

Margaret Hill lunged to protect her daughter—a backhand sent her sprawling.

"Mr. Maddox!" Vincent toppled from his chair. "I'll repay everything! Don't hurt my family!"

Hugo crouched, his cigarette nearly scorching Vincent's cheek. "Begging now?" His grin turned feral. "But I've got a better idea."

A nod sent Sophia being dragged toward a vehicle.

"Harvard grad, right?" Hugo's voice dripped mockery. "My club needs hostesses—she'll work off the debt."

Vincent turned ashen. "No! My daughter can't—"

"Seven million." Hugo held up two fingers. "Pay now or..." His gaze slid to Sophia's struggling form.

Margaret clung to Hugo's leg. "We'll sell our house!"

He kicked her away. "That dump?" A cold laugh. "Won't cover the interest."

Sophia's screams pierced the empty countryside. Vincent collapsed in the mud, helpless as she was shoved into the SUV.

"Dad! Save me!" Her nails left bloody streaks on the door.

Hugo patted Vincent's cheek. "Don't worry—I'll take good 'care' of her." He turned, then paused. "Your wife's aged, but she'll do after a wash."

Vincent shook uncontrollably as Margaret was hauled toward another vehicle. Engines roared—the black SUVs vanished in a spray of dirt.

Only Vincent remained, his elongated shadow stretching across the mud in the dying sunset.
###Chapter 272

Liam Croix took a drag from his cigarette, studying Vincent Lowell and his daughter through narrowed eyes.

He suddenly scoffed. "Harvard's top student? More like a failed exchange student. Vincent, your audacity is astounding."

Smoke curled around his fingers as he held up five digits. "Five million. Plus your daughter. Consider the interest waived."

Vincent's face turned ashen.

"If you can't pay..." Liam's gaze slid to Brandon and Margaret. "Shall we add your wife and son to the collateral?"

He deliberately drew out the last word.

This was a mission from his superiors—to make the Lowells suffer beyond imagination.

A perfect chance to complete his task and curry favor with the big shots.

Two birds with one stone.

"No!"

Sophia Lowell's shrill cry cut through the air.

Her entire body trembled, but she forced her chin up. "Mr. Croix, I can bring you greater value!"

"Vincent and the others are yours to deal with. I severed ties with them long ago!"

Her voice cracked with suppressed sobs.

Liam's predatory stare reminded her of the humiliation Sebastian Royston had inflicted.

That degradation—she'd rather die than endure it again.

"Interesting." Liam arched an eyebrow.

Vincent exploded. "You ungrateful bitch! Denying your own father?"

"Father?" Sophia's laugh was ice.

Her wounds still throbbed beneath her clothes.

Each scar bore their signature.

"Take them away." Liam flicked his wrist.

Bodyguards roughly shoved Vincent into a waiting car.

Margaret and Brandon struggled futilely before being dragged off.

Only Sophia remained on the empty lot.

Liam exhaled a smoke ring. "Explain. How exactly will you make me money?"

She leaned in, whispering against his ear.

A calculating gleam flashed in Liam's eyes. "Fine. We'll do it your way."

His fingers dug into her chin. "Don't disappoint me."

Sophia swallowed her revulsion, nodding obediently. "You have my word, Mr. Croix."

"Back to Cloudhaven!" Liam barked.

This game of cat and mouse had only just begun.
###Chapter 273

Evelyn Laurent quickly pushed thoughts of Vincent Lowell to the back of her mind.

Finals week descended upon Harvard University, casting a tense atmosphere over the entire Physics Department.

Evelyn sat in the library, her notebook sprawled open with formulas scribbled across the pages. Lillian Rothschild chewed on the end of her pen, frowning at the problem set before her.

"Use Fourier transform here," Evelyn tapped the question lightly with her pencil.

A few physics majors nearby glanced at them hesitantly but ultimately kept their distance.

Since Evelyn's true identity had been exposed, those who once mocked her alongside Sophia Lowell now avoided her like the plague. They skirted around her carefully, even their eye contact measured and cautious.

Lydia Montgomery's seat remained empty. After the incident, she rarely showed up to class, and when she did, she seemed lost in a daze.

"Finally done!" Lillian burst out of the exam hall, stretching her arms wide.

Sunlight filtered through the plane trees in front of the academic building, casting dappled shadows. Just as Evelyn was about to speak, she noticed the mischievous glint in Lillian's eyes.

"Your man's here!" Lillian waggled her eyebrows and jerked her chin toward the distance. "I'm out!"

Beside a black Maybach, Ethan Sullivan's tall frame stood out sharply. He leaned against the car door, his gaze burning into Evelyn.

A week apart had honed his jawline even more sharply.

"How was the exam?" Ethan reached for her backpack.

Evelyn sidestepped his hand. "Fine."

The warmth inside the car chased away the chill but did nothing to dissolve the silence between them. Ethan's fingers tightened slightly around the steering wheel.

"You're avoiding me," he said abruptly.

Evelyn stared at the scenery flashing past the window without answering.

"Is it because of what Sophia said?" Ethan's voice was low. "Or... did you find something?"

Evelyn whipped her head around, meeting his deep, unreadable gaze. Emotions she couldn't decipher swirled within them.

"You knew I was looking into you?"

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted in a bitter smile. "The Lowells pulled strings to check flight records from three days ago. And..." He paused. "The archives of Cloudhaven Orphanage from fifteen years ago."

Evelyn's breath caught.
###Chapter 274

Alexander Langley acted swiftly, kicking Ethan Sullivan out of the "Princess Evelyn Fan Club" group chat.

Ethan stared at his phone screen, fingers trembling slightly.

Evelyn Laurent bit her lower lip. "I don't believe a single word Sophia says."

Yet the phrase "Ethan Sullivan is in love with you" echoed relentlessly in her mind like a curse.

She rubbed her temples in frustration.

Ethan hesitated, then finally murmured, "Shall we get dinner?"

"Sure."

The car started smoothly, heading toward Ethan's favorite private dining spot.

Just outside campus, a black Maybach blocked their path.

Alexander stepped out with long strides, his gaze sharp as a blade.

"Get out," he said, yanking open the passenger door.

Evelyn froze.

Ethan's knuckles whitened as he gripped the steering wheel.

Their eyes locked in a silent battle.

But Alexander turned to Evelyn. "We're going home."

"What happened?"

"An emergency."

Evelyn hesitated, glancing at Ethan before finally exiting the car.

Ethan watched their retreating figures in the rearview mirror and slammed his fist against the wheel.

He dialed a number. "Cancel the reservation."

His carefully planned confession had just been ruined.

At the Langley mansion, Evelyn sensed something was wrong the moment she stepped inside.

Victoria Langley sat rigidly on the sofa, her expression stormy.

"Mom, what's going on?"

Evelyn's gaze landed on the coffee table—and her pupils constricted violently.

Why was that diary here?

Her heart leaped into her throat.
###Chapter 275

Evelyn Laurent quietly moved to the sofa and sat down with caution.

Her head was lowered, fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her dress.

Victoria Langley's expression softened slightly, but when her gaze landed on the documents on the coffee table, her brows furrowed tightly again. "Evelyn, tell me the truth. What is all this?"

The papers trembled faintly in Victoria's grip.

Evelyn discreetly glanced around the room.

Her father, Alexander Langley, wore a stormy expression. Her five brothers were equally stone-faced.

The atmosphere in the living room was suffocating.

"I—"

Before she could speak, Theodore Langley cut in angrily, "Did that bastard Ethan Sullivan force you to sign this?"

Theodore's fists clenched audibly, his eyes burning with fury.

The agreement spelled it out in black and white: Their relationship was a sham. Once Ethan found the woman he truly wanted to marry, the engagement would be terminated immediately.

Every clause stabbed at the Langley family's hearts.

Ethan had used their treasured daughter as a shield.

Worse, his heart still belonged to the girl who had been kidnapped with him a decade ago.

Victoria's hands shook slightly, her eyes brimming with disappointment.

Evelyn took a deep breath and lifted her chin. "He didn't force me."

Her voice was soft but firm.

"I was the one who wanted to call it off first."

"This is better for both of us."

The room fell deathly silent.

Evelyn bit her lip before continuing, "Mom, Dad, brothers... I don’t want to be tied down by an engagement so soon."

"I know you all like Ethan, but..."

She paused, her gaze clear and resolute. "Right now, marriage isn’t what I want."

It was the first time she had spoken her mind so openly.

Julian Langley was the first to respond. "Evelyn’s right. There’s no need to rush into this."

"I support ending the engagement," Theodore immediately agreed.

The others nodded in unison.

Victoria studied her daughter’s stubborn expression and finally sighed. "As long as you’re happy."

Evelyn’s eyes grew slightly damp. She knew her family would always stand by her.
###Chapter 276

Victoria Langley gazed at her daughter's face, her fingertips lightly brushing through the girl's hair.

"Evelyn, are you absolutely certain about this?"

Evelyn Laurent pressed her lips together and nodded, her eyelashes casting delicate shadows under the light.

"Mother, I refuse to be shackled by this engagement any longer."

A sudden smile curved Victoria's lips, gentle creases appearing at the corners of her eyes.

"Then we'll go to the Sullivans' immediately."

Evelyn's head jerked up, her fingers unconsciously tightening around the hem of her dress.

"Now?"

Ethan Sullivan's stormy expression flashed through her mind, an inexplicable weight settling in her chest.

Victoria observed her daughter's reaction with careful neutrality as she rose gracefully.

"Strike while the iron is hot."

Six brothers materialized around them in perfect synchronization. Alexander Langley seized his sister's wrist decisively.

"Move out!"

Surrounded by her brothers, Evelyn found her steps slowing despite their momentum.

She remembered the rigid line of Ethan's jaw whenever the broken engagement was mentioned.

Recalled all those times he'd quietly shielded her from trouble without a word.

The Langley motorcade descended upon the Sullivan estate in full force.

The butler burst into the drawing room in disarray.

"Sir! The Langleys have arrived in force!"

Vincent Sullivan set down his teacup with deliberate calm, his gaze drifting toward the closed door on the second floor.

"Let the boy stew for a while."

Upstairs, Ethan stood at the window, his knuckles pressed against the chilled glass.

He watched Alexander lead Evelyn from the car, his expression darkening instantly.

Victoria rang the doorbell with aristocratic poise.

"We're here to dissolve the engagement."

Evelyn lingered at the back of the group, her heartbeat stuttering.

Suddenly, she wasn't certain what answer she truly wanted to hear.
###Chapter 277

Steward Zhang had just finished speaking with Vincent Sullivan when Victoria Langley's entourage arrived at the Sullivan mansion with an imposing presence.

"Sir, the Langleys are here," Steward Zhang announced respectfully as he opened the door, but his heart skipped a beat when he saw their expressions.

He silently lit a metaphorical candle for young master Ethan in his mind.

"What a pleasant surprise. To what do we owe this visit?"

Vincent Sullivan greeted them with a warm smile, his gaze sweeping over the Langley family before settling on Evelyn Laurent.

The six Langley brothers stood rigid, their faces stormy with barely contained fury.

Though Victoria and Richard Langley appeared composed, the chilling aura around them was palpable.

Only Evelyn remained unfazed.

Vincent took note of everything.

"We came to speak with Ethan," Victoria said coolly. "Evelyn has something to say to him in person."

"Steward Zhang, fetch my son," Vincent instructed casually. "The boy locked himself in his room earlier—no idea what got into him."

He deliberately paused.

"I've never seen him so distraught before."

As he spoke, Vincent cast a meaningful glance at Evelyn.

Victoria and Richard exchanged a look, understanding dawning.

They took their seats on the sofa, and Victoria cut straight to the point. "Vincent, given our families' longstanding friendship, I'll speak frankly."

She could tell Vincent already knew everything.

And more importantly—

He seemed to be leaving the decision entirely in the Langleys' hands.

Vincent nodded. "Of course."

Upstairs, Ethan Sullivan gripped the woven charm bracelet so tightly his knuckles turned white.

A tempest of emotions raged in his eyes, his entire body taut with restless agitation.

Knock knock knock—

"Young master, the Langleys are here. Your father requests your presence."

Ethan's heart lurched.

Suppressing his unease, he schooled his expression and opened the door.

Downstairs, the Langleys and Vincent sat facing each other, the air thick with tension.

The moment Ethan appeared, his gaze locked onto Evelyn.

Simultaneously, six pairs of icy eyes pinned him in place, their hostility sharp enough to flay him alive.

"Uncle, Aunt, Alexander... Theodore," Ethan greeted each respectfully.

Theodore Langley scoffed. "Don't call me that—you're older than me!"

The address made his skin crawl.

How could this man have such audacity?

"Sit," Victoria said flatly, not even sparing him a glance.

Her demeanor was a far cry from her usual warmth.

Vincent smoothly intervened. "Weren't we here to discuss something?"

Alexander Langley wordlessly slid a document across the table toward Vincent. "Take a look, Mr. Sullivan."

His voice was glacial.

After pushing the file forward, he withdrew his hand, offering no further explanation.

Ethan's temple throbbed as he recognized the contents.

His lips pressed into a thin line, his gaze darkening as it returned to Evelyn.
###Chapter 278

Evelyn Laurent felt the scorching gaze on her. Her fingers curled slightly as she hid the agreement behind her back.

She'd been caught.

Now the entire family would share her humiliation.

Vincent Sullivan's smile froze when his eyes landed on the document.

He whipped his head toward Ethan Sullivan, his glare murderous.

"Ethan Sullivan!"

The coffee table shook as Vincent slammed his palm down. His voice was laced with ice. "You've got nerve. Signing this kind of agreement with Evelyn?"

"If you don't like her, say it outright. Why play these games?"

Ethan kept his eyes lowered, silent.

He knew he was in the wrong.

Vincent's rage boiled over. He grabbed the feather duster beside the table and swung it at Ethan. "I'll beat some sense into you today, you ungrateful brat!"

"Uncle Vincent!"

A slender figure suddenly stepped between them.

Evelyn gripped the feather duster with white-knuckled force.

"I signed the agreement willingly," she said, lifting her chin defiantly. "If you're going to hit him, hit me too."

A flicker of amusement crossed Vincent's eyes, though his expression remained stormy. "Step aside, Evelyn. This boy needs to be taught a lesson!"

He yanked the duster back.

It didn't budge.

He pulled harder.

Still immovable.

Vincent stared.

Since when did this girl have such a grip?

"I was the one who proposed the engagement," Evelyn said softly but clearly. "Neither of us wants a relationship built on obligation."

She felt Ethan's gaze burning into her back.

Her heart twisted.

"So..." She took a deep breath. "Please grant us your blessing to end the engagement."

It was the first time she'd spoken so much in front of an elder.

Her fingertips trembled.

Yet she felt an inexplicable sense of release.

"Uncle Vincent," Alexander Langley interjected coldly, "forced affection never lasts."

He stood, his imposing frame casting a shadow.

"Since Ethan's heart belongs to another, don't waste my sister's time."

This wasn't a request.

It was a declaration.
###Chapter 279

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the Sullivan family's living room. The six Langley brothers formed a protective circle around Evelyn, standing like sentinels.

"Ethan Sullivan has someone else in his heart. Why should our Evelyn suffer this humiliation?" Vincent Langley spoke coldly, his expression stern.

"Exactly!" Sebastian Langley slammed his hand on the table as he stood. "If he wants to marry our sister, he must love her wholeheartedly!"

"The jewel of our family will never marry a man whose heart belongs to another." Julian Langley's voice held finality.

Ethan's knuckles turned white. His Adam's apple bobbed, but no words came out.

How could he explain? Should he just admit the girl who haunted his dreams was Evelyn herself?

Victoria Langley elegantly lifted her teacup and took a sip. "Vincent, we all admire Ethan's loyalty."

"To keep searching for over a decade because of a childhood promise—that kind of devotion is rare."

"So we've decided to grant his wish."

Evelyn's head jerked up, but her mother silenced her with a look.

"Aunt Victoria!" Ethan stood abruptly. "Actually, I—"

"No need." Victoria interrupted gently. "Love can't be forced. Our Evelyn has other options."

She gave Ethan a meaningful glance. "I hope you find that girl soon and understand your own heart."

Ethan froze as if struck by lightning.

Vincent Sullivan cleared his throat. "In that case, let's consider the engagement null and void. Evelyn, what do you think?"

His sharp gaze pinned Evelyn in place.

Her fingers tightened around her skirt. "Thank you for your understanding, Uncle Vincent."

Richard Langley rose to leave. "We've overstayed our welcome."

"Our Ethan was at fault." Vincent Sullivan apologized.

Victoria guided her daughter out, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Silence descended upon the living room.

Vincent Sullivan gazed thoughtfully at the doorway before turning to see his son's thunderous expression.

"Ethan—"

Before he could finish, Ethan stormed upstairs, slamming his bedroom door with enough force to shake the house.

Vincent shook his head and retreated to his own room.

The moment the door closed, he burst into laughter.

His always composed son had finally shown his true colors.
###Chapter 280

The night was ink-black. Ethan Sullivan stood by the window, his fingers unconsciously tracing the faded woven charm bracelet.

Ten years.

The bracelet had long lost its original vibrancy, much like the blurred figure in his memories.

"Young master, your father requests your presence," murmured Mr. Zhang outside the door.

Ethan placed the bracelet back into its velvet box, his expression unreadable.

Vincent Sullivan was brewing tea in the study.

"I hear the Langleys are sending Evelyn abroad?" Vincent asked without looking up.

Ethan's posture stiffened.

"You already knew."

It wasn't a question.

Vincent finally raised his eyes to his son's tense jawline. "The Langleys are giving you time."

The teacup clinked against the saucer.

"After ten years of searching, you're certain it's her?"

Ethan's fists clenched.

Of course he was certain.

Those eyes—he could never mistake them.

Yet the words died on his lips.

Vincent sighed. "Go to the Langleys. Don't live with regrets."

The black sports car shot through the gates like an arrow.

The Langley mansion blazed with light.

Victoria Langley stood at the second-floor window, watching the familiar car vanish into darkness.

"Is this too cruel?" she whispered.

Richard Langley embraced his wife from behind. "If he can't pass this test, he doesn't deserve our daughter."

Victoria recalled the investigation report.

That kidnapping a decade ago had altered both children's fates.

Her Evelyn had suffered so much abroad.

While Ethan had spent ten years searching, clinging to a promise.

"But what if—" Victoria hesitated.

"No what-ifs," Richard said firmly. "If he can't distinguish obsession from love, he has no place by Evelyn's side."

Upstairs, Evelyn Langley sat at the piano.

The keys responded dully beneath her fingers.

She remembered her parents' words earlier.

"Evelyn, you'll be studying in France."

It wasn't a suggestion, but a decree.

The music stopped abruptly.

An engine roared outside.

Evelyn moved to the window just as the familiar sports car pulled up to the Sullivan residence.

Her fingers tightened on the curtains.

Ten years.

She should have known—some bonds weren't meant to be.
###Chapter 281

Victoria Langley saw everything with perfect clarity.

She had watched Ethan Sullivan grow up. His character was an open book to her.

Yet it was precisely this familiarity that forced her to take drastic measures.

Her precious daughter had suffered enough.

Evelyn Laurent had endured seventeen years of hardship.

Victoria sighed at the thought.

"Our Evelyn is utterly clueless about matters of the heart," she murmured. "Consider this a chance for Ethan—and for Evelyn to discover what he truly means to her."

She suddenly looked up, unease flickering in her eyes. "Darling, do you think they'll resent me when they realize I orchestrated this?"

Richard Langley stroked her hair tenderly. "Never. Your intentions are pure."

"You always take my side," Victoria huffed playfully.

"My queen's word is law," Richard chuckled, pressing a kiss to her forehead.

A blush crept up her cheeks as she lightly punched his chest. "They're perfect for each other. Since Evelyn won't see it, we're giving them a nudge."

"Your wish is my command."

Evelyn remained oblivious to her parents' scheming.

Lying in bed, she stared at the pink diamond bracelet on her wrist. Its soft glow under the lamplight made her vision blur.

Ethan's face materialized before her.

Sophia's words echoed in her mind—Ethan's unrequited love was for her.

A strange warmth unfurled in her chest.

What had she done all those years ago to leave such an impression? Why had he remained silent during the Sullivan family's interrogation?

Would things have been different if he'd spoken up?

Evelyn shook her head violently. The engagement was over. She should be relieved.

She switched off the main light, leaving only the dim bedside lamp. Curling under the covers, she closed her eyes.

The nightmare struck without warning.

Dank basement air assaulted her senses—mold and blood intermingling. The fleeting image made her fists clench the sheets.

Darkness surged like a tidal wave. Fear morphed into a monstrous presence advancing relentlessly. She twisted restlessly, brows furrowed.

The scene shifted abruptly.

She was running through pitch-black nothingness. Malevolent laughter chased her. Footsteps grew louder.

"You little bitch! Keep running!"

"Leading an escape? I'll kill you!"

A meaty hand yanked her small body upward.

"Let me go!"

Young Evelyn drove her fist into the man's eye. As he recoiled, she scrambled free and kept running.

"I'll slaughter you today!"

The threats pursued her like shadows.
###Chapter 282

Evelyn Laurent caught a glimpse of the man bending down to pick up a thick wooden stick.

He was sprinting toward her.

She hadn't eaten in two days.

Her legs felt like lead, every step sinking into cotton.

Just as the stick was about to strike her back—

A slender figure suddenly rushed from the side and yanked her away.

The boy turned and took the full force of the blow on his back.

"Ugh!"

A pained grunt exploded in her ear.

The strikes rained down.

But he shielded her with his body, his voice trembling yet firm. "Don't be afraid. I'll protect you."

Exhausted, the man dragged them back to the basement, cursing under his breath.

The boy was beaten to the brink of death.

Little Evelyn crawled over, tears dripping. "Does it hurt, big brother?"

He forced a weak smile. "No. I promise I'll get you out of here, Evelyn."

"There are too many of them. We need a plan..."

Two small figures huddled in the dark corner.

In that lightless dungeon, they were each other's only solace.

Evelyn's eyes snapped open.

She stared blankly at the ceiling.

That wasn't a dream.

It was a real memory she had forgotten.

The phantom pain of the beating still lingered on her back.

But only fragments of the memory had resurfaced.

What had happened after the kidnapping?

She strained to remember, but it was like peering through frosted glass.

Only the boy's face remained vivid—piercingly clear.

Ethan Sullivan.

Ten years ago, he had already shielded her from the storm.

That promise—"I'll protect you"—had been made a decade ago.

Her fingers clenched the sheets, knuckles turning white.

Dawn light crept through the window.

Sleep was impossible now.

She dressed quietly in workout clothes.

A morning run might calm her chaotic thoughts.

As soon as she stepped out of the Lowell mansion, she froze.

A man in black sat motionless on a bench in the cold winter morning.

Evelyn frowned.

She steadied her breathing and continued jogging.

The sound of her footsteps made the man turn his head slowly.
###Chapter 283

Evelyn Laurent's footsteps came to an abrupt halt.

The figure on the bench looked especially frail in the morning mist.

Ethan Sullivan sat there, a cigarette burning down to its filter between his fingers.

He resembled a statue dusted with frost, his lashes coated in a thin icy layer.

Evelyn's gaze dropped to the scattered cigarette butts at his feet.

They lay in chaotic heaps, like some silent struggle made tangible.

"Ethan?" she called softly.

The man jolted as if electrocuted.

He moved too quickly, nearly tripping over his own stiff legs.

"I wasn't smoking!" He frantically tossed the cigarette into a trash bin. "Just... lighting it for fun—"

His voice trembled noticeably.

Only then did Evelyn notice his fingers had turned purple from cold.

She frowned. "How long have you been sitting here?"

Ethan avoided her eyes. "Don't remember."

He truly didn't.

After returning from the racetrack, he'd somehow ended up here.

Watching the sky lighten by degrees.

"Couldn't sleep?" Evelyn asked suddenly.

Ethan blinked, then gave a bitter smile. "That obvious?"

In the dawn light, his features looked unusually sharp.

Evelyn turned away abruptly. "Want to go for a run?"

Ethan froze.

He glanced down at his stiff fingers, then up at Evelyn already jogging ahead.

"Wait for me."

He rubbed his face vigorously, bouncing in place a few times.

When Evelyn looked back, she caught him flailing like an awkward penguin.

A laugh escaped her.

The sound made Ethan pause mid-stretch.

Her eyes glittered startlingly bright in the mist.

"What's so funny?" He feigned sternness.

"Nothing." Evelyn resumed running. "Just never thought Mr. Sullivan could be... cute."

When Ethan caught up, he deliberately positioned himself upwind.

He didn't want her smelling the tobacco on him.

They ran side by side through the empty streets, their breaths mingling in white puffs.

Neither mentioned the unsmoked cigarettes.

Or the sleepless night.
###Chapter 284

Liam's gaze locked onto the bouquet in the boy's hand.

The innocent-looking flowers set off alarm bells in his mind.

The child's grip was too precise—a telltale sign of professional assassin training.

"Get back!"

He moved like lightning, shielding Evelyn with his body.

His fingers clamped around the boy's wrist like steel jaws.

"Big brother, what's wrong?" The child's angelic face twisted with a flicker of malice.

Liam twisted his wrist sharply. A cry of pain escaped the boy's lips.

Crushed petals rained from the child's palm—just ordinary flowers.

But that earlier thrust had carried lethal intent.

"Liam!" Evelyn gasped at his sudden movement.

While attention was diverted, the cowering security guard sprang into action.

A silenced pistol flashed toward Liam's back.

The trigger pulled without hesitation.

Phut

The bullet tore through air—only to meet flesh.

A spray of crimson bloomed across Lillian's ivory gown like winter roses.

"Lillian!"

Liam's roar shattered the night.

He caught her collapsing form. Warm blood soaked through his fingers.

The bullet had lodged in her lower back, pumping life onto the pavement.

The guard raised his weapon again.

Liam's eyes turned glacial.

With Lillian in his arms, he blurred forward.

A single kick sent the guard crashing into a stone pillar.

Spine protruding through flesh. Instant death.

Evelyn screamed again.

The wiry boy had produced a combat knife, thrusting toward her heart.

Tires screeched.

A black Lincoln plowed into the child, sending him flying.

Felix leapt from the driver's seat, face ashen. "Everyone okay?"

"Open up!" Liam barreled into the backseat with Lillian.

He tore away bloodied fabric, flushing the wound with water.

One palm struck her abdomen.

Ping—the bullet ricocheted off leather upholstery.

Silver needles flashed. The bleeding slowed.

"Revival Hall. Now!" Liam's voice shook.

Felix floored the accelerator.

Sirens wailed from all directions.

Spotlights flooded the interior. A dozen police officers advanced with drawn weapons.

"Exit the vehicle! Hands on your heads!" A hawk-nosed lieutenant barked through a megaphone.

Liam patted his pockets—his military ID was back at the clinic.

He stepped out, hands raised. "Critical patient inside. Immediate medical attention required."

"Drop your weapons! Now!"

Liam's eyes turned arctic. "Final warning. Move."

"Just shoot him, Captain," an officer muttered.

Before the words faded, Liam materialized beside the speaker.

One hand lifted the lieutenant by the throat.

"Try and stop me."

The roar carried bone-shaking force. Officers clutched their ears in pain.

The suspended lieutenant kicked weakly, face purpling.

Under moonlight, Liam stood like a wrathful deity.

To save Lillian, he'd wage war against the world itself.
###Chapter 285

Ethan Sullivan's eyes darkened abruptly.

An indescribable emotion churned in his chest.

An uncontrollable thought surfaced in his mind.

The token necklace symbolizing their promise had first appeared on Sophia Lowell.

When he first saw Sophia wearing that necklace, he instinctively rejected the truth.

He dismissed the possibility almost instantly.

Yet the necklace hung around Sophia's neck.

What if the girl from back then was really Sophia?

Ethan's brow furrowed deeper.

A cruel realization struck him.

No matter who that girl had been, he wouldn't have fallen for her.

He might have offered generous compensation, but never marriage.

Once, he believed finding that girl meant he must marry her.

But when it wasn't Evelyn Laurent—

Ethan suddenly understood he felt no impulse to wed.

In other words—

He had fallen for Evelyn through their shared moments.

Before knowing she was that girl, he'd already regarded her differently.

At first, it might have been an act.

But later, Ethan knew with certainty—it was no longer pretend.

This realization darkened his gaze further.

"Ethan."

Evelyn's soft voice called to him.

She studied his tense profile. "How did you confirm it was me you sought?"

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted as he masked the turbulence in his eyes. "The butterfly birthmark behind your left ear."

Evelyn's fingers flew to the spot in surprise. "You remembered after ten years?"

His voice lowered. "And the token."

"Token?"

After a pause, Ethan withdrew two items from his pocket.

One was his necklace. The other—a faded woven charm bracelet with a tiny longevity locket.

He opened his palm slowly.

Evelyn stared at the bracelet as memories flooded back.

Her trembling fingers closed around it.

The buried past sharpened into focus.

It was the eve of the Dragon Boat Festival.

Margaret Hill had unusually taken her shopping.

The crowded mall dazzled young Evelyn with colorful stalls.

Though starved for maternal affection, she still craved attention.

When she paused at a charm bracelet stand, Margaret actually bought one—

An ordinary woven bracelet with a golden longevity locket.

Delighted, Evelyn fastened it around her wrist.

Her mother's first gift.

That day, Margaret didn't just buy the bracelet—

She also bought Evelyn ice cream.
###Chapter 286

Evelyn Laurent cradled the tiny ice cream cone, tentatively licking the melting treat. The cloying cream dissolved on her tongue, but couldn't warm the chill in her heart.

Margaret Hill had promised to buy her a new dress before leaving, instructing the six-year-old to wait obediently at the alley's mouth. Evelyn clutched the half-melted dessert until twilight swallowed the streets.

The chloroform's pungent scent assaulted her senses before she could even cry out "Mommy."

Her lashes fluttered now as fingertips absently traced the faded woven charm bracelet. The locket's engravings had blurred with time, much like that deliberately forgotten summer in her memory.

The kidnapping had been an orchestrated abandonment from the very beginning.

"Evelyn?"

Ethan Sullivan's palm enveloped her icy fingers, warm and steady. He saw the storm clouds swirling in her eyes, dark as the sea before a tempest.

"Just old memories." She returned the bracelet to its velvet case, the metallic whisper against silk unnaturally loud. "Like how this token came into my possession."

Dead leaves skittered from the alley's locust tree, triggering the memory of her fifth day in captivity—the kidnappers' frantic arguing. The Lowells had never intended to pay the ransom.

Ethan suddenly turned her shoulders toward him. "Don't." His thumb brushed moisture she hadn't realized escaped her eyes. "Those monsters belong in hell."

A startled laugh escaped her. The winter wind scattered her hair, revealing the pale scar along her neck—a souvenir from the barbed wire during her escape.

"Is your car warm?" She changed subjects, spotting the Paxil box peeking from his trench coat. The antidepressant was painfully familiar.

Ethan fumbled to conceal it, only to freeze at her quiet confession: "I'm on Zoloft too."

Two fractured souls stood beneath the streetlamp, their shadows merging into something whole. The woven bracelet gleamed dully in the moonlight—a timeworn witness to their shared scars.
###Chapter 287

The icy wind howled as Evelyn Laurent tightened her down jacket around herself. After a moment's hesitation, she slipped into Ethan Sullivan's car.

Warm air rushed over her, thawing her frozen fingers at last.

"How long have you been waiting here?" She couldn't help asking, noticing the redness on the tip of Ethan's nose.

Condensation blurred the view outside the window, but couldn't hide the exhaustion in Ethan's eyes.

His fingers paused slightly on the steering wheel. "Not long."

Evelyn spotted the whitened frostbite marks on his knuckles. Her heart clenched inexplicably.

"About yesterday..." She bit her lower lip. "My parents went too far."

The air inside the car turned heavy.

Ethan gave a bitter chuckle, his long fingers tapping the steering wheel absently. "They were right. I'm not good enough for you."

His words stabbed Evelyn's heart like a thorn.

She jerked her head up, meeting Ethan's deep gaze. "That's not true," she protested instinctively. "It's me—"

BANG!

The window rattled violently from a sudden impact.

Evelyn jumped, turning to see Theodore Langley's handsome face pressed against the glass.

"Evelyn!" Theodore yanked open the back door, teeth clenched. "Sneaking around with some man in the middle of the night?"

Ethan stepped out calmly, standing at attention. "Sixth Brother."

"Who's your brother?" Theodore bristled. "Don't you dare claim relation, old man!"

Evelyn cringed with embarrassment, grabbing her furious brother's arm. "We just ran into each other—"

"Ran into each other?" Theodore scoffed. "His car's been parked outside our building for an hour!"

Evelyn gaped at Ethan in surprise.

Under the moonlight, the man's ears turned pink, yet he remained standing tall and straight like a silent pine tree.
###Chapter 288

Ethan sat with his head lowered, long fingers absently tracing the steering wheel.

Streetlight shadows fell across his lashes, casting his entire figure in unspoken melancholy.

Theodore frowned.

Why did this bastard look like an abandoned golden retriever?

"Evelyn!" Theodore rushed to the car in three strides, yanking the door open. "Why are you with this scumbag? Did he trick you?"

His sharp gaze darted between them before settling on Ethan with open hostility.

"We've called off the engagement, Mr. Sullivan." Theodore's jaw clenched. "Stay away from my sister."

Ethan slowly lifted his head.

"I just didn't want her to be cold." His voice was barely audible. "The car has heating."

Theodore scoffed. "Then why not take her home?"

"The Lowells won't let me through the gates." A bitter smile touched Ethan's lips. "My father barred me from returning too."

Theodore arched an eyebrow. "Vincent kicked you out?"

"Yes." Ethan nodded. "He said I deserved it for losing his daughter-in-law."

Theodore's mouth twitched.

Was this bastard playing the victim card?

"You own other properties."

"Transferred them all to Evelyn." Ethan's expression remained neutral.

Theodore momentarily lost his words.

He shielded Evelyn behind him like a bristling cat. "Stay away from my sister!"

Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest at her brother's protective stance.

She gently tugged Theodore's sleeve. "Sixth Brother, he didn't hurt me."

"You're defending him?" Theodore's eyes widened. "He's the bastard who broke your engagement for another woman!"

Evelyn bit her lip. "Actually... I was the one he'd been waiting for."

"What?!" Theodore whirled around. "Ethan was looking for you?"

His furious gaze swung between them before exploding. "Ethan Sullivan! Why didn't you say so? We could've found Evelyn sooner!"

Ethan's fingers tightened imperceptibly.

He lowered his lashes, voice rough. "I feared... it would endanger her."

The streetlight painted fractured shadows across his profile, isolating him in the glow.
###Chapter 289

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed his words.

He stared at Theodore's icy expression before sighing. "Theo, I truly didn't know Evelyn was her."

"Even when we brought her back to the Sullivan estate, I had no idea she was the one I'd been searching for."

His voice dropped low with remorse.

He wished he could travel back in time and strangle his past self for signing those documents.

Had he known Evelyn Laurent was that little girl, he'd never have agreed to break off their engagement.

Now the decision felt like shooting himself in the foot.

Theodore snorted. "Idiot."

His cutting remark held no mercy. "Ten years of searching and you still couldn't recognize her? Some love that is."

"Let's go, Evelyn. Don't waste time on this fool."

Theodore grabbed Evelyn's arm to leave.

She glanced back at Ethan's motionless figure.

The tall man looked heartbreakingly lonely in the morning light. Her heart softened. "Would you... like to join us for breakfast?"

Ethan's eyes instantly brightened.

He practically sprinted after them, terrified Theodore might change his mind. "Yes!"

Theodore rolled his eyes dramatically.

But seeing Ethan's pitiful expression reminded him how the man had always looked out for him since childhood.

Plus, Theodore knew Ethan's heart belonged solely to his sister. His anger cooled slightly.

"Only because you got kicked out," Theodore lifted his chin haughtily. "But if you try anything funny, my brothers won't go easy on you."

Ethan grinned like a cat who got the cream. "Whatever you say, Theo."

Theodore made a face but didn't protest further.

As they entered the living room, Alexander looked up from his newspaper.

His expression darkened immediately upon spotting Ethan. "Who invited you?"

"Evelyn did," Ethan answered sweetly, unable to hide his smugness.

Alexander's razor-sharp gaze shifted to Theodore.

"Big bro!" Theodore raised his hands in surrender. "She really invited him herself! I couldn't stop her!"

Bringing home the man whose engagement she'd just broken yesterday?

Theodore wanted to cry. He shot desperate looks at his sister.

Evelyn stifled a laugh. "Alexander, Mr. Sullivan kicked him out. He looked so pitiful..."

Ethan nodded eagerly, giving Alexander his best puppy-dog eyes.

Alexander's eyes narrowed dangerously, the air around him turning frigid. But ultimately, he said nothing more.
###Chapter 290

Alexander Langley's gaze lingered on Evelyn Laurent for a moment before flickering with resignation.

His foolish little sister was being played like a fiddle by Ethan Sullivan.

Long fingers tapped rhythmically against the armrest as he returned his attention to the financial newspaper.

Theodore Langley exhaled quietly, his dress shirt clinging to his damp back.

Even as the company CEO preparing to enter the professional league circuit, he still felt like a chastened child under his eldest brother's scrutiny.

Ethan finally allowed his tense shoulders to relax slightly.

Getting past the Langley estate's front gates meant he'd already won half the battle.

Sebastian Langley froze mid-step on the spiral staircase.

"What are you doing here?" His voice could have flash-frozen the Mediterranean as his eyes narrowed dangerously.

Ethan remained unflappable. "Evelyn invited me."

Sebastian's razor-sharp glare sliced between them before he snorted and took a seat opposite.

As the other Langley brothers descended, the living room's temperature plummeted.

Six pairs of eyes honed to dagger-points impaled Ethan where he sat.

If stares could kill, he'd be leaking from more holes than a colander.

Ethan serenely lifted his teacup, utterly unfazed by the palpable hostility.

"Why so quiet down here?" Victoria Langley's sleep-roughened voice floated from upstairs.

She descended rubbing her eyes, then arched an eyebrow at the unexpected guest. "Ethan?"

He rose immediately with perfect decorum. "Mr. and Mrs. Langley."

Theodore barely suppressed an eye roll.

Such a damn performance.

Richard Langley frowned. "To what do we owe this visit?"

"Father disowned me." Ethan's expression didn't flicker. "Evelyn took me in."

A glimmer of amusement flashed through Victoria's eyes before vanishing.

Richard studied him with new interest.

As if the Sullivan patriarch would ever cast out his only heir.

When his gaze shifted to his daughter, Evelyn threw up both hands. "I really did invite him!"

Her cheeks flushed scarlet, desperate to prevent any misunderstanding.

The atmosphere thickened like overcooked pudding.
###Chapter 291

A glint of amusement flickered in Richard Langley's eyes.

He maintained his aloof expression. "Let's eat."

His slender fingers encircled Victoria Langley's wrist as he guided her downstairs.

Evelyn Laurent rose from her seat just as Ethan Sullivan instinctively moved to her side.

Six pairs of burning eyes seemed to scorch his back.

The corner of Ethan's lips curved slightly.

With Evelyn present, the Langley brothers had no choice but to suppress their displeasure.

At the very least, this breakfast was his to enjoy.

The clinking of silverware filled the dining room.

Evelyn methodically sliced her bacon, catching the dark expressions of the Langley brothers from the corner of her eye.

Alexander Langley abruptly set down his napkin.

"Mr. Sullivan must have pressing matters at the office. Perhaps you should leave early?"

The dismissal couldn't have been more blunt.

Evelyn rose gracefully, the sharp crease of his suit pants unyielding.

"You're right. I should go." He turned to Evelyn. "I'll be staying at the company for a while."

Evelyn frowned. "Why?"

"The old man's orders." A wry smile touched his lips. "I'm forbidden from setting foot in the Sullivan mansion until I've earned your forgiveness."

Theodore Langley scoffed. "Then it seems you'll be sleeping on the streets, Mr. Sullivan."

Evelyn merely shrugged.

His retreating figure carried a hint of solitude.

Evelyn stared at the space he'd occupied, lost in thought.

Had Uncle Sullivan really banished his own son?

No wonder Ethan had only signed the agreement without breaking off the engagement...

"Evelyn!"

Six voices chimed in unison.

Sebastian Langley gripped her shoulders. "Stop thinking about that bastard!"

"Have you forgotten he's in love with someone else?"

Dizzy from the shaking, Evelyn's mind flashed to the desolation in Ethan's eyes moments ago.

Something in her chest gave a faint, inexplicable tug.
###Chapter 292

"What kind of man do you like, Evelyn? I know plenty of eligible bachelors who'd be perfect for you!" Julian Langley winked playfully.

"Ethan Sullivan isn't your only option!"

Her six brothers crowded around Evelyn Laurent, each offering enthusiastic matchmaking suggestions.

Tilting her head thoughtfully, Evelyn countered, "But honestly, can anyone in the country compare to Ethan?"

The brothers fell silent.

Damn.

They couldn't refute their sister's logic.

Julian cleared his throat first. "But Ethan's heart belongs to someone else!"

Evelyn blinked her large eyes earnestly. "The person he's been waiting ten years for... is actually me."

Except for Julian and Theodore, the other four brothers gaped in shock.

This revelation hadn't surfaced in their investigations.

Yet seeing their sister's unwavering confidence, understanding dawned on them.

Their gazes snapped toward their parents.

Victoria Langley simply smiled and nodded.

So Mother had known all along!

Julian's mind raced. "Even if it's you, he only knew you as a child. What if it's just gratitude or guilt?"

"That's not real love. Don't let him deceive you!"

Evelyn frowned at her third brother. "I know that. We've remained friends since calling off the engagement."

The brothers exchanged uneasy glances.

They feared their sister was getting too attached.

That Ethan was a master manipulator!

He'd probably come to the Langley estate just to play the victim.

Their jaws clenched in frustration.

They needed to introduce Evelyn to other exceptional men—immediately.

Julian's eyes sparkled with sudden inspiration. "Evelyn, could you do me a favor?"

Leaning closer, he deployed his Oscar-winning charm with a pout. "Would you join me for a family reality show episode? Just like the one Theodore did with me last time."

"Theodore can't make the next recording. Will you be my partner instead?"

Faced with her movie-star brother's puppy-dog eyes and pleading tone, Evelyn's resistance crumbled.

She glanced at Theodore. "You're really unavailable?"

Theodore caught Julian's subtle headshake and sighed. "Yeah, I have intensive training."

Julian turned up the charm. "Please, little sister? It's just a lighthearted show about sibling dynamics with some fun games."

"If you don't come, they'll pair me with a fake sister." His voice softened. "You're my only real sister."

Evelyn's resolve melted. "Alright, I'll do it."

Then hesitation flickered across her face. "But I've never been on camera before. Won't I embarrass you?"

Her brother was a national treasure.

Could an ordinary girl like her really measure up?
###Chapter 293

Evelyn Laurent finally nodded in agreement to Julian Langley's reality show proposal.

Julian's peach-blossom eyes instantly sparkled with delight. He ruffled Evelyn's hair, unable to suppress his excitement. "I knew you'd say yes, Evie!"

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, gilding his features. His face—often called "the nation's first love"—beamed so brightly it seemed to sweeten the air around them.

Evelyn held her breath.

Her third brother truly deserved his title as an Oscar-winning actor.

"It's called Taste of Home," Julian explained eagerly. "A family-bonding show filmed on Coral Island in the South Sea."

He studied his sister's expression discreetly.

Since breaking off her engagement with Ethan Sullivan, Evelyn had been withdrawn. That bastard Ethan kept posting vague social media updates that made Julian's blood boil.

This show was the perfect opportunity.

A chance to cheer Evelyn up, let their family witness their dynamic through the live broadcast, and—most importantly—make Ethan back off for good.

"Ten days of filming, just in time to return for New Year's," Julian added. "It's 28°C on the island—we'll escape the winter in the capital."

A flicker of interest crossed Evelyn's eyes.

She'd never left the capital before. The prospect of a tropical island getaway was undeniably tempting.

"Are you... sure I can do this?" she whispered.

"Absolutely," Julian declared.

On departure day, the Langley mansion descended into chaos.

When Victoria Langley stuffed a fifth down jacket into the suitcase, Julian groaned. "Mom! It's the tropics!"

"What if there's a cold snap?" Victoria shot back, then turned to cram medications into Evelyn's bag. "Evie, speak up if you feel unwell. Don't tough it out."

Richard Langley stood by silently.

Nathaniel Langley approached holding a scalpel, its blade glinting coldly. "Julian."

Two syllables made Julian's spine stiffen.

"Don't worry, bro!" He raised his hand in oath. "I'll bring Evie back in one piece!"

Alexander Langley adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his gaze sharp behind the lenses. "Daily video check-ins."

"The crew's confiscating phones—"

"Figure it out," Alexander said with finality.

Watching her family's concern, warmth flooded Evelyn's chest. She hugged Victoria. "I'll take care of myself, Mom."

Julian seized the moment to drag their luggage toward the door. "Let's go! We'll miss our flight!"

The production team's van idled outside the gates. Evelyn took a deep breath and stepped forward—into her very first journey far from home.

###Chapter 294

The Lowell family discreetly escorted Julian Langley and Evelyn Laurent to the airport.

Everyone wore face masks and aviators to avoid unnecessary attention.

Evelyn stayed close to Julian, her fingers nervously twisting the hem of her blouse.

"Relax," Julian murmured reassuringly.

She took a deep breath and followed him into the VIP lane.

Thirty minutes later, their plane pierced through the clouds, heading toward Cloudhaven.

Meanwhile, Ethan Sullivan stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, listening to his assistant's report.

"Miss Laurent has boarded?" A faint smirk played on his lips.

He'd been discreetly monitoring Evelyn's movements these past few days.

Unfortunately, her six brothers guarded her like a fortress.

"Harrison, you're in charge of the company," Ethan instructed as he turned.

Harrison Whitmore's eyes widened. "Where are you going, Mr. Sullivan?"

"A reality show." His tone was breezy.

Harrison nearly choked.

The CEO of Sullivan Group joining a reality show?

Then it clicked.

Only one person could make Ethan abandon work—Miss Laurent.

Four hours later, the plane touched down smoothly at Cloudhaven Airport.

Evelyn trailed behind Julian as they disembarked.

The production crew was already waiting.

"Mr. Langley, this is..." A staff member gaped at the mountain of luggage behind Julian.

Julian adjusted his aviators calmly. "Essentials."

The assistant director approached, torn between amusement and exasperation. "We're here to film, not vacation!"

Evelyn stifled a giggle behind Julian.

Her gaze swept the surroundings, sensing unseen eyes watching her.
###Chapter 295

Julian Langley dropped his luggage on the floor and collapsed into his seat.

"Mom insisted I bring Evelyn along," he grumbled. "Who dares disobey the matriarch?"

Timothy Gold, the assistant director, perked up immediately, his gaze locking onto Evelyn Laurent.

"Miss Laurent, I'm Timothy Gold."

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "Director Gold."

Julian interjected, "Tim and I have worked together before. He's one of us."

Timothy adjusted his glasses with a knowing smile. "This reality show focuses on sibling bonding, but..." He deliberately drew out his words. "Your brother is famously terrible at games."

"Hey!" Julian bristled. "Don't embarrass me in front of Evelyn!"

Timothy feigned innocence. "Just giving Miss Laurent fair warning."

Julian turned to his sister, eyes sparkling. "Evelyn's amazing at games. She'll carry me this time!"

Evelyn suppressed a smile.

Her brother's gaming skills... were indeed a tragedy.

"Wow," Timothy gasped dramatically, covering his mouth. "An Oscar-winning actor needs his little sister to carry him?"

Julian huffed and stared out the window.

So humiliating!

At least the live stream wasn't running yet.

Where would he hide his face otherwise?

Amused by their banter, Evelyn's eyes crinkled with silent laughter.

The car soon arrived at the hotel.

This season featured twelve celebrity-sibling pairs.

Evelyn and Julian were the first to arrive.

"Mr. Langley, you'll be in this suite," Timothy handed over the keycard. "The other guests will arrive over the next two days."

After settling in, Julian eagerly suggested, "Evelyn, want to explore?"

"Sure."

Before they left, Timothy reminded them sternly, "Keep those masks on!"

The production team had already hyped the show on social media.

Though the cast remained unannounced, the tropical island teaser had sparked massive buzz.

Viewers everywhere were eagerly waiting.

###Chapter 296

Julian Langley spent the entire day showing Evelyn Laurent around Cloudhaven.

From the misty dawn to the glittering evening lights, they sampled every local delicacy. They only returned to the hotel when night had fully fallen.

Evelyn froze the moment they stepped into the lobby.

Two familiar figures stood at the center.

Beatrice Quincy looked ready for a red carpet event in her designer suit and flawless makeup, chatting animatedly with Timothy Gold.

Beside her, Bianca Fairchild was a stark contrast.

Head bowed and dragging her luggage, Bianca seemed shrouded in shadows next to her radiant sister.

"Director Gold, has Julian Langley arrived yet?"

Beatrice's sickly sweet voice cut through the air.

Timothy offered a professional smile. "My apologies, Miss Quincy. Guest information is confidential."

Even a child could hear the dismissal in his tone.

A flicker of irritation crossed Beatrice's eyes before she forced another saccharine smile. "How thoughtless of me."

Just then, Timothy spotted Julian and Evelyn entering.

He gave an imperceptible blink.

Julian immediately tugged his cap lower and steered Evelyn toward a different elevator.

"Third Brother, are they also guests?" Evelyn whispered inside the elevator.

Julian nodded. "The Quincy sisters. Night and day."

Coldness flashed in his eyes.

During the last recording, he'd secretly helped Bianca multiple times. Otherwise, her situation would've been far worse.

Beatrice had never treated Bianca like a sister.

Back in their room, Evelyn curled up on the sofa with her tablet. "I want to watch the last episode."

She quickly finished the edited version of Sibling Revelry.

Her expression darkened.

Just as she'd suspected, Beatrice had crafted a perfect persona while painting Bianca as both foolish and malicious.

Bianca's passive acceptance made Evelyn's chest tighten.

Ding-dong—

The sudden doorbell interrupted her thoughts.

The moment Julian opened the door, Beatrice's delighted voice rang out. "Julian Langley! It really is you!"
###Chapter 297

Julian Langley was packing his luggage when the knock came.

He frowned and opened the door, his expression instantly turning icy at the sight of Beatrice Quincy's flawlessly made-up face.

"What do you want?" He braced one arm against the doorframe, making no move to let her in.

Beatrice flipped her hair with a practiced smile. "I heard the Oscar-winning actor Julian Langley was joining this season's show. Thought I'd drop by to say hello."

She rose on her tiptoes, peering over his shoulder into the room. "I wonder who your partner will be this time—"

"None of your business." Julian cut her off, his voice frigid. "If that's all, I need to rest."

He moved to shut the door.

Beatrice hastily pressed a hand against it. "Wait! I—"

Bang!

The door slammed in her face, the gust of wind tousling her bangs.

Trembling with rage, she dug her nails into her palms.

An Oscar-winning actress like her—when had she ever been treated with such disdain?

Inside the suite, Evelyn Langley was curled on the sofa watching past episodes.

"Third Brother, you're too harsh on women." She didn't look up. "Beatrice looked like she was about to cry."

Julian scoffed. "She was acting."

He sat beside his sister just as the screen showed him and Theodore Langley bumbling through a game challenge.

"Why are you watching this?" He reached for the remote.

Evelyn dodged with a grin. "It's hilarious."

A flood of LOLs scrolled across the screen:

[Is this really an Oscar winner's gaming skills?]
[Theodore looks ready to strangle his brother]
[Guess they traded brains for looks and talent]

What annoyed Julian most was how Beatrice always swooped in to "rescue" him during these moments.

Shippers spammed the comments:
[Beatrice is so protective of Julian]
[This ship is canon]

"Third Brother," Evelyn leaned in suddenly, "you're not actually into Beatrice, are you?"

"Never!" Julian nearly leapt off the sofa. "That two-faced woman makes my skin crawl!"

Evelyn collapsed into giggles.

At dawn the next day, production vans arrived at the hotel.

A new season of filming was about to begin.
###Chapter 298

The sea breeze gently brushed across the deck of the luxury yacht.

Bianca Fairchild and Beatrice Quincy stood side by side, their profiles dazzling under the sunlight.

Julian Langley leaned lazily against the railing while Evelyn Laurent stood beside him, curiously observing the other guests.

"Is that Crystal Rothschild?" Evelyn whispered.

Julian followed her gaze. The rising starlet Hugo Rothschild was tenderly fixing his sister's wind-tousled hair.

"And the Clemenson siblings," Julian pointed toward Rachel and Leo Clemenson, who were taking photos nearby.

The newly arrived Liam and Lucas Croix chatted with the crew. Both wore sportswear, radiating youthful energy.

"The director mentioned two mystery guests," Evelyn said, eyes sparkling. "Who could they be?"

Timothy Gold approached with a megaphone. "Everyone, please gather in the conference room."

Inside, Eugene York adjusted the equipment.

"These mystery guests are special," he said with a mysterious wink. "You'll find out when we reach the island."

Julian suddenly frowned. "This yacht..."

He felt an odd familiarity with the vessel but couldn't place it.

"What's wrong?" Timothy asked sharply.

"Nothing." Julian waved it off. "Since when did the production team become so extravagant?"

Timothy cleared his throat. "A guest sponsored it."

His evasive tone hinted at hidden truths.

As the yacht departed, the live broadcast began.

Eugene collected everyone's phones. "This season's theme is—Survival Challenge!"

Evelyn clenched her fists in excitement while the others exchanged uneasy glances.

"Don't worry, we've scouted the location," Eugene reassured. "The island is safe with abundant resources."

Crystal bit her lip. "Are we really staying there?"

"Of course," Eugene said. "But basic supplies will be provided."

Leo suddenly raised his hand. "Director, will the mystery guests join us?"

Eugene smirked. "They're already on the island."

The yacht cut through the waves toward the unknown destination. No one noticed Julian's increasingly grave expression as he stared at the horizon.

Something told him this wouldn't be a simple filming.
###Chapter 299

The live stream had barely begun when Danmu flooded the screen.

"Finally! This lineup is incredible!"

"Oh my god! Is that a luxury yacht? The production team went all out!"

"I heard they're filming on a private island. The trailer looked unreal!"

Eugene York smiled at the camera, microphone in hand. "Welcome, everyone. Let's start with brief introductions from our guests."

Beatrice Quincy stepped forward first, flipping her hair gracefully. "Hello, I'm Beatrice Quincy."

Bianca Fairchild followed, her voice barely audible. "I-I'm Bianca Fairchild..."

The other guests introduced themselves one by one. Finally, it was Julian Langley's turn—and the girl standing beside him.

Julian offered a warm smile. "I'm Julian Langley."

The moment the camera panned to the young woman next to him, Danmu exploded.

"Evelyn Laurent," she said coolly, her expression unreadable.

"Wait—Julian's partner changed?"

"Who is she? She looks just like him!"

"Is she the rumored seventh Langley sister?"

"No way a Langley heiress would join a reality show."

"Total plastic surgery vibes. Just riding Julian's fame."

"The official account mentioned a special guest. Probably a civilian role."

Evelyn remained oblivious to the chatter, standing quietly at Julian's side with perfect poise.

The other guests, however, couldn't stop staring. Sunlight gilded her delicate features, making even Beatrice glance twice.

Beatrice clenched her fist. She'd heard about the scandal at Harvard. This Evelyn had publicly humiliated her adoptive parents—cold and calculating.

"Attention, everyone," Eugene interrupted. "We'll reach our destination in three hours. Feel free to rest until then."

The live feed cut off abruptly, but speculation about the mysterious girl had only just begun.

No one noticed Evelyn's face growing paler by the minute.
###Chapter 300

Evelyn curled up on the cruise cabin sofa, her body limp as if drained of all strength.

The ship swayed with the ocean waves, making her dizzy and nauseous.

Her knuckles turned white as she gripped the armrest.

A sheen of cold sweat coated her forehead, her lips pale.

"Evelyn!"

Julian burst into the room, his heart clenching at the sight of his sister.

He rushed forward, nearly stumbling from the ship's violent rocking.

"Julian..." Her voice was barely audible, trembling with tears. "I think... I'm seasick."

Julian fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a packet of Dramamine. "Take this!"

Though he also felt queasy, his symptoms were milder since he'd taken the pills earlier.

Evelyn swallowed the medicine but still shivered with discomfort.

This was her first time on a ship.

She never imagined it would be this unbearable.

Three hours later, the cruise finally slowed as it approached the island.

Through the porthole, Evelyn glimpsed lush greenery, and her dull eyes instantly brightened.

"We're here!"

Her weak cheer came out hoarse.

Julian exhaled in relief.

On deck, Timothy Gold raised a megaphone. "Welcome to the filming location of Island Adventure!"

The live stream resumed.

The Fairchild sisters disembarked first. Bianca was ghostly pale, doubling over to vomit the moment she stepped onto the dock.

Beatrice patted her back anxiously.

The other guests followed suit.

The Langley siblings staggered off last, only relaxing when their feet touched solid ground.

Evelyn discreetly stretched her shaky legs.

Finally free.
###Chapter 301

Comments fluttered across the live stream like snowflakes.

"Finally, season two! Beatrice looks stunning today!"

"How dare Bianca show her face after hurting Beatrice last time?"

"Who's that new civilian girl clinging to Julian?"

Evelyn Laurent sensed hostile gazes as cameras panned over the guests. She instinctively moved closer to Julian Langley.

"Relax," Julian murmured, maintaining his Oscar-winning actor aloofness.

Beatrice Quincy approached with a saccharine smile. "Need help, Julian?"

"No." His curt reply made her smile falter.

A flicker of malice crossed Beatrice's eyes when she glanced at Evelyn.

"Ugh—"

Bianca's sudden retching broke the tension. She crouched on the sand, face ashen.

Evelyn frowned and pulled a water bottle from her bag.

"Here."

Bianca looked up, startled. "Thanks..." Her weak gratitude held complex emotions.

The cameras captured it perfectly.

"That civilian's surprisingly kind."

"Total act for screen time."

Timothy Gold clapped for attention. "Welcome to 'Sibling Revelry' season two! We'll spend ten days surviving on this private island!"

He winked. "You've noticed our two mystery guests."

Cameras shifted to Liam and Lucas Croix, who fidgeted under the celebrities' gaze. Rachel and Leo Clemenson appeared more confident from last season's popularity.

Crystal Rothschild clung to her brother Hugo's arm. "Hi everyone!"

Hugo merely nodded, his icy prince persona intact.

"First challenge—build your camp!" Timothy announced. "Two hours. Teams of two."

Evelyn moved toward her brother, but Beatrice intercepted.

"Partner with me, Julian?"

"I already have one." Julian strode to Evelyn, leaving Beatrice digging nails into her palms.

Danmu exploded.

"What's happening?"

"Who IS that civilian?"

Island winds whipped Evelyn's hair. She glanced toward the dense jungle, sensing unseen eyes watching...
###Chapter 302

His icy demeanor had also attracted many fans.

Timothy Gold winked mysteriously and raised his megaphone. "Ladies and gentlemen, the most exciting moment has arrived!"

He deliberately drew out his words, his gaze sweeping over each guest.

Julian Langley leaned lazily against a tree trunk, his fingers unconsciously rubbing his cuff.

"But before revealing the final two mystery guests—" Timothy suddenly raised his voice. "We're going to play a little game!"

Julian's brow furrowed slightly.

The word "game" gave him an instant headache.

"See that little cabin with the red roof?" Timothy pointed into the distance. "Our new guests are waiting for you there."

"The first guest to arrive will receive a million-dollar island development resource package!"

Drones buzzed overhead, capturing every subtle change in expression.

Evelyn Laurent's eyes sparkled like stars.

She flexed her wrists, her gaze burning toward the finish line.

"Each team will send one representative!" Timothy announced.

"I'll do it!" Evelyn dashed forward in a flash.

Beatrice Quincy followed closely. "Bianca isn't feeling well. I'll take her place."

Rachel Clemenson gave Julian a meaningful look. "Not joining us, Oscar winner?"

Julian waved a dismissive hand. "I have terrible luck."

His peripheral vision caught Evelyn's eager stance, and the corner of his mouth lifted.

The danmu exploded:

[Is this girl crazy? What's a twig like her trying to prove?]

[Clearly Julian wants nothing to do with her!]

[Are you blind? He literally admitted he's a game jinx!]

[I think the way he looks at her is kinda tender?]

Rachel narrowed her eyes.

If Evelyn really were a Lowell heiress, why would Julian let her participate in such a physical challenge?

She smirked inwardly, waiting for the show.
###Chapter 303

The drone camera captured Evelyn Laurent stretching her wrists at the starting line. Her high ponytail swayed as the black tracksuit accentuated her snow-pale complexion.

"On your marks—"

Timothy Gold's voice barely faded before Evelyn launched forward like a cheetah.

Approaching the first hurdle, she tapped the ground lightly with her toes. Her body soared through the air in a flawless arc, landing without even stirring dust.

The obstacle pit loomed ahead. She vaulted in, palms bracing against the walls. With a powerful core twist, she flipped over the edge effortlessly—as though she'd practiced the move a thousand times.

Danmu exploded across screens:

[Holy shit that was insane!]

[Queen Evelyn slays! Those core muscles!]

At the one-meter wall, Evelyn suddenly accelerated. Her right foot kicked off the surface while her left hand gripped the ledge. A graceful front flip carried her over.

Hugo Rothschild's pupils constricted. He'd just cleared the third hurdle when the black-clad figure was already sprinting toward the balance beam.

Thud.

Evelyn knocked on the cabin door just as Beatrice Quincy crawled out of the pit, disheveled. Dirt streaked her ruined updo and tracksuit.

Live stream comments scrolled wildly:

[The skill gap is ridiculous]

[Evelyn is legendary!]

[Where are the haters now?]

A crew member stammered, "Y-yes, the mystery guest is inside..."

Evelyn shook her ponytail, breathing as steady as if she'd taken a leisurely stroll. She glanced back at the course—Hugo was scaling the final obstacle wall, sweat glistening at his temples.

The drone caught the feral curve of her lips. That satisfied smirk of a well-fed predator.

"Seems I won decisively."
###Chapter 304

Hugo Rothschild vaulted over the obstacle wall with feline grace, landing squarely before the cargo net.

The other contestants lagged far behind, their movements clumsy in comparison.

Julian Langley watched with a faint smile, his gaze tracking the agile figure.

His sister Evelyn was performing exceptionally well.

"Little brother?" Evelyn prompted again.

The staff member snapped out of his daze. "Right! This is the spot."

As she reached for the door, he hastily added, "But we can't open it until all contestants finish."

Evelyn withdrew her hand, standing composed at the finish line.

The survival kit was as good as hers.

Crystal Rothschild and others gaped at the timer, stunned by Evelyn's staggering lead.

Hugo arrived second, a full minute behind Evelyn.

Leo Clemenson panted as he stumbled across the line. "Miss Laurent, your speed is insane!"

Evelyn merely glanced at him without responding.

Liam Croix followed, dusting himself off awkwardly. "Evelyn, I take back what I said earlier."

His face burned with humiliation.

The group assembled at the finish—except for Beatrice Quincy.

The cameras panned to the pit obstacle where Beatrice struggled pathetically.

After multiple failed attempts to climb out, tears welled in her eyes.

The live chat exploded:

[Help Beatrice already!]

[That useless Bianca!]

[Faking seasickness? Disgusting!]

Bianca Fairchild fought through her nausea, staggering toward the pit.

"Sis, let me pull you up."

Beatrice grasped her hand gratefully. "Thank you, Annie."

In that instant, cold calculation flashed in Beatrice's eyes.

She yanked hard.

"Ah!"

Bianca toppled into the pit, her skull striking a rock. Blood gushed instantly.

"Annie!" Beatrice shrieked in feigned alarm.
###Chapter 305

Bianca Fairchild's vision went black.

The violent impact nearly knocked her unconscious.

Her already weakened body took another devastating blow.

Beatrice Quincy's sudden yank caught her completely off guard.

"Bianca, are you okay?"

Beatrice clutched her with panic-stricken hands, voice trembling. "This is all my fault. I shouldn't have pulled you when you're not feeling well."

Blood streamed down Bianca's forehead.

Pain sealed her lips shut. She could only bite down hard.

Her face turned ghostly pale.

"Bianca, say something!"

Beatrice stamped her foot in distress.

Timothy Gold and the crew rushed over. Staff members scrambled to pull them ashore.

Evelyn Laurent approached with stormy eyes.

She'd seen Beatrice's deliberate tug clearly.

But the angle made it nearly impossible for cameras to catch.

Medics arrived swiftly.

The gash on Bianca's forehead was horrifying. Blood painted half her face crimson.

Beatrice stumbled backward at the sight.

[She's totally faking it! Look how scared Beatrice is!]

[This has to be staged. She's trying to frame our Beatrice!]

[How dare this imposter act so bold?]

[After everything the Quincy family's done for her, this is how she repays them?]

The live chat exploded.

Victoria Langley watched the stream with furrowed brows. She turned to Richard Langley. "What's wrong with the Quincys? Beatrice is clearly targeting Bianca. The online abuse is vile. Aren't they going to intervene?"

She'd done her research.

Bianca had been cyberbullied relentlessly since episode one.

Richard's gaze darkened. "Bianca isn't their biological daughter. Just a stepping stone they cultivated for Beatrice."

Victoria clenched her fists. "That girl has gone too far."

"Bianca's such a sweet child."

Gentle. Well-mannered.

Yet always bullied.

She remembered Bianca vividly.

But family matters weren't hers to meddle in.

With a sigh, Victoria refocused on her daughter.

Pride instantly lit her face. "Look at our Evelyn! She's lightning fast!"

Evelyn moved like a blur.

The drone barely kept pace with her sprint.

Her athletic form made Victoria's pulse race.

Richard chuckled, pulling his wife close. "Our girl's always been the best."

"Damn right!"

Victoria nestled against him, eyes glued to the screen.

Meanwhile, on the island...
###Chapter 306

Bianca Fairchild's forehead was now wrapped in pristine white gauze.

Beatrice Quincy's eyes reddened, her voice trembling. "It's all my fault for reacting too slowly..."

She carefully grasped Bianca's hand, her fingertips shaking. "Does it hurt?"

Bianca gave a faint shake of her head, her lips pale. "It's nothing."

She forced a weak smile. "Don't let me delay the filming."

Timothy Gold visibly relaxed after confirming she was okay. "Glad you're alright."

Evelyn Laurent shot Beatrice a cold glance but remained silent.

The minor disturbance quickly settled.

All eyes returned to the mysterious wooden cabin.

Timothy announced with a smile, "The obstacle course winner is Evelyn Laurent! She'll unveil our mystery guests!"

Evelyn was genuinely curious about the identities of these guests.

The production team had kept it airtight—not even she could guess who they were.

With anticipation, she pushed open the wooden door.

The interior was modest, sparsely furnished.

A chessboard sat in the center, where two men were engaged in a game.

The man in black facing away from the door exuded calm, while his opponent in a gray suit kept glancing outside.

The moment the door opened, the gray-suited man jerked his head up.

Evelyn's pupils constricted.

Beatrice's shriek echoed simultaneously. "Big brother?!"

Bianca looked up, her face paling further at the sight of Xander Quincy.

Why was he here...

The live chat exploded:

[Beatrice called him big brother?]

[The Quincy heir actually showed up!]

[Look at that worried expression—definitely here to back Beatrice!]

[The Quincys really dote on her!]

Xander's gaze slid past Beatrice before settling on Bianca's bandaged forehead.

His Adam's apple bobbed, words caught in his throat.

In the end, he just turned away irritably.

Evelyn's attention was wholly captured by the man in black.

That silhouette felt inexplicably familiar.

As if sensing her stare, he slowly rose and turned.

A breathtakingly handsome face came into view.

Those deep eyes locked onto Evelyn.

Julian Langley instantly bristled. "Ethan Sullivan?!"

He yanked at his hair in frustration. "You're the mystery sponsor?"

No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't keep this guy from chasing after her!
###Chapter 307

Ethan Sullivan's lips curved slightly, his eyes shimmering with warmth.

"Third brother."

His gaze lingered briefly on Julian Langley before shifting to Evelyn Laurent, his smile deepening.

Those profound eyes reflected only one person's image.

On the cruise ship deck, the sea breeze tousled his hair.

[Ethan Sullivan, CEO of Sullivan Group!]

[He never participates in reality shows!]

[Even the International Physics Society's invitation was declined]

[What's so special about this show?]

The live chat exploded instantly.

Viewership numbers skyrocketed visibly.

The six Langley brothers stared at the screen, their expressions darkening one by one.

Julian scoffed, his sharp gaze like daggers.

The other guests stood frozen in shock.

Crystal Rothschild discreetly smoothed her dress while Rachel Clemenson nervously twisted the hem of her shirt.

"Welcome our two new members."

Timothy Gold broke the tension smoothly.

Facing the cameras, Ethan's aura turned icy.

"Ethan Sullivan."

Three simple words chilled the air.

Xander Quincy followed suit. "Xander Quincy."

Scattered applause echoed through the space.

Julian crossed his arms. Evelyn frowned slightly.

"Congratulations, Evelyn Laurent, for winning the Survival Kit."

A staff member handed her a camouflage backpack.

Evelyn eagerly unzipped it.

Flashlight. Lighter. Hardtack...

"That's it?"

She pouted, twirling the Swiss Army Knife between her fingers.

Timothy smirked mysteriously. "These are life-saving essentials."

"Time to form teams—four members each."

He shook a lottery box.

Evelyn stepped forward first.
###Chapter 308

Ethan Sullivan stepped forward, intending to approach Evelyn Laurent.

Julian Langley reacted instantly, pulling Evelyn protectively behind him.

"I'll go," he said coldly, his tall frame completely blocking Ethan's line of sight.

Ethan remained unfazed, casually drawing a lot.

The grouping results were soon announced.

Julian Langley, Evelyn Laurent, Ethan Sullivan, and Xander Quincy formed the first team.

Bianca Fairchild and her brother were paired with the Croix brothers in the second team.

The Clemenson siblings and the Rothschild siblings made up the third team.

Julian's expression darkened instantly.

His gaze locked onto Ethan, radiating danger.

Timothy Gold discreetly tugged at his sleeve. "Mr. Langley, mind your expression."

The usually composed Oscar-winning actor now resembled a bristling lion.

Ethan remained unperturbed, though a flicker of warmth crossed his eyes when he glanced at Evelyn.

His purpose here had always been singular.

"Brother, looks like we're opponents now," Beatrice Quincy teased Xander with a playful wink. "Go easy on me."

Xander nodded indulgently. "Of course."

But his gaze darkened when it briefly passed over Bianca.

"Tonight is the last dinner and lodging provided by the production crew," Timothy announced through the megaphone. "Starting tomorrow, you'll be surviving on this island independently."

The staff served an elaborate feast.

Ethan had arranged the menu in advance, with most dishes tailored to Evelyn's preferences.

Evelyn scanned the spread before taking her seat, deep in thought.

Julian immediately claimed the seat to her left.

Ethan calmly settled into the chair on her right.

The other guests gradually joined the table.

With the survival challenge looming tomorrow, everyone ate with unusual focus.

The Croix brothers and the Clemenson siblings devoured their meals heartily.

Such refined cuisine would be hard to come by in the days ahead.

The cast members regarded Ethan with newfound reverence.

This sponsor was someone to keep on their good side.
###Chapter 309

The live stream cut off abruptly, sending Twitter into a frenzy.

Two hashtags battled for the top spot: #CancelBiancaFairchild and #EthanSullivanJoinsShow.

The reality show Siblings skyrocketed in popularity. Despite multiple interruptions, viewers remained rabidly engaged.

The dynamic duo Eugene York and Timothy Gold had undeniable star power. Every show they produced struck a chord with audiences, amassing legions of loyal fans.

The real surprise was landing Julian Langley, one of Hollywood's biggest stars. Ethan Sullivan's unexpected appearance sent ratings through the roof.

The barrage of excited comments nearly overwhelmed the screen.

The private island, rented at astronomical cost, became the audience's biggest obsession.

Lush jungles and turquoise shores glowed on camera, a rare winter paradise while most of the country lay buried in snow.

Dinner ended in uneasy silence.

Ethan sat at the head of the table, his presence making everyone tread lightly. Even breathing seemed too loud.

Timothy patted his round stomach. "Tonight you'll sleep on the yacht again. This cabin will serve as our supply depot." He winked. "Starting tomorrow, all survival gear must be earned through challenges."

Crew members distributed black wristbands.

"These are specialized GPS trackers," Timothy emphasized. "Most of this island is uncharted wilderness. Keep them on at all times."

Evelyn Laurent toyed with her band, the metal glinting coldly under the lights. She snapped it on and turned toward the window.

Moonlight cascaded over the island like liquid silver.

Salty ocean air carried the scent of tropical foliage.

Without hesitation, Evelyn pushed back her chair.

Julian followed instantly, shooting Ethan a guarded look.

The Oscar-winning actor dabbed his lips with a napkin and rose leisurely.

Rachel Clemenson tugged her brother's sleeve. "Let's get some air?"

Crystal Rothschild linked arms with her brother, beaming. "The moon's too beautiful to miss."

The Croix brothers trailed wordlessly behind.

The cabin door creaked as ten figures melted into the night.

Pearlescent sand shimmered under the moon. Waves crashed against the shore in the stillness.

Each wore the black wristband—puppets strung by invisible threads.

Deep in the jungle, unknown creatures shrieked.

The darkness yawned like a beast's maw, patiently awaiting its prey.
###Chapter 310

The suited man's taunting made Zhang Yuan frown.

What status did this guy think he had?

And who did he think the old man was?

Memories from his past life flooded back in an instant.

Li Aiping!

The wealthiest man in Qingcheng!

This elderly gentleman had only found his long-lost son on his deathbed.

He wandered these old streets alone because it was where he'd lost his beloved child.

His wife had died young from heartbreak.

His younger second wife bore him a daughter.

The icy beauty standing before them—Li Ruobing.

As for this suited man...

Zhang Yuan found no trace of him in his memories.

Neither biological nor adopted son.

Most likely one of Li Ruobing's suitors.

Realizing this, Zhang Yuan smirked.

"Whoever you are...bring it on."

"My acupuncture needles will settle this."

The suited man trembled with rage.

Just as he prepared to retaliate, Li Ruobing's tearful voice interrupted.

"Chen Tao! What's the point of this now?"

"Call an ambulance!"

The man shot Zhang Yuan a venomous glare.

His gaze lingered briefly on Lin Weiwei.

Reluctantly, he pulled out his phone.

"Fine...don't worry Ruobing...I'll contact the hospital."

He secretly snapped photos of Zhang Yuan and Lin Weiwei.

Before he could dial, ambulance sirens approached.

Probably called by bystanders.

Seeing the paramedics arrive, Zhang Yuan tugged Lin Weiwei away.

She stomped her foot in frustration.

"Yuan! This family's insane!"

"You tried helping and they attacked you."

"No wonder people hesitate to assist elders these days..."

Zhang Yuan simply smiled.

He saw greater opportunities ahead.

'When the old man wakes, he'll come thanking me.'

'Then...I'll help him find his lost son...'

'That favor will be worth his while.'

"Yuan? Why so quiet?"

"Disappointed? That woman actually hit me!"

"Money doesn't excuse that behavior!"

"If you hadn't stopped me, I'd have—"

Zhang Yuan waved her off.

"Let it go. Misunderstandings get cleared eventually."

"By the way, how'd you get here?"

Lin Weiwei shook her phone.

"Rideshare...Yuan, I'm starving."

"Barbecue on me?"

Zhang Yuan's stomach growled before he could refuse.

Twenty meters ahead, "Nautilus Grill's" neon sign glowed.

"Fine. My treat."

Lin Weiwei's eyes sparkled.

"I'm ordering everything!"

......

Inside the barbecue joint.

Lin Weiwei eagerly scanned the menu.

"Yuan, pork belly okay?"

"How about ribeye? Spicy clams?"

Zhang Yuan sighed. "Your call."

"The black pepper sausages look good..."

"New place. Never tried."

Lin Weiwei poured tea and offered fruit.

"Yuan, about boosting yang energy—"

His phone rang—Su Rourou calling.

Lin Weiwei pouted.

"Wife checking in?"

"Heard she's vacationing in Europe with friends..."

Zhang Yuan's expression shifted.

This call...meant trouble.

"Hello?"

A saccharine voice answered.

"Honey~ Miss me?"

"Busy at the clinic?"

Zhang Yuan suppressed his disgust.

"Swamped. With patients."

"Need something?"
###Chapter 311

The sudden surge of spiritual pressure in the air froze Ling Jiuzé in place.

This level of oppressive force was unmatched in all of Emberfall City.

Only a legendary Golden Core cultivator could wield such power...

Impossible!

How could a young man reach such heights?

Yet the churning of his blood didn't lie—he was truly immobilized under this crushing weight.

Ling Jiuzé gritted his teeth, forcing his spiritual energy to resist. His eyes burned with disbelief as he glared at Thunderblade.

The air between them seemed to solidify.

Ling Jiuan sensed the tension but couldn't grasp its source.

Beads of sweat formed on Ling Jiuzé's forehead, his face growing paler by the second.

Thunderblade remained unfazed, not even a ripple disturbing his robes.

Just as Ling Jiuan opened her mouth to speak, a delicate fragrance drifted through the air.

The servants snapped out of their daze, bowing in unison. "Madame Lan."

Ling Jiuan turned to see an elegant noblewoman gliding toward them.

"My dear fifth daughter has finally returned." The woman's smile was warm as she descended the steps.

Thunderblade's gaze flickered, the oppressive aura vanishing instantly.

Ling Jiuzé exhaled sharply, his flexible sword clattering to the ground.

Madame Lan's eyes gleamed as she clasped Ling Jiuan's hands. "How I've missed you all these years, my dear."

Ling Jiuan subtly withdrew her hands. "Your concern is appreciated, Aunt Lan."

"Mother, look at her arrogance!" Ling Jiuzé snatched up his sword, scowling. "Winning one match by luck doesn't make her special!"

"Silence!" Madame Lan chided lightly. "Your sister triumphed in the arena despite lacking spiritual roots. Such perseverance deserves praise."

Ling Jiuan smirked inwardly.

Her stepmother's acting far surpassed her children's.

With a final glare, Ling Jiuzé stormed off.

Madame Lan turned to Thunderblade with feigned surprise. "And this gentleman is—"

"My master, Thunderblade." Ling Jiuan cut her off, tugging him away without ceremony.

Behind them, Old Nanny Liu's whining voice rose. "Madame, the fifth young lady—"

"Hold your tongue! Masters disciplining servants is only natural!" Madame Lan snapped.

Ling Jiuan didn't pause or glance back.

"Your stepmother seems protective," Thunderblade remarked.

"False kindness," Ling Jiuan scoffed. "If she truly cared, would she let servants withhold my allowances?"

A glint of approval flashed in Thunderblade's eyes. "Not as foolish as you appear."

"What's that supposed to mean?" She glared. "That was a temporary act. Don't actually think you're my master now."

"Commit to the role once taken." He strode ahead into the courtyard. "Remember to address me properly before others."

Ling Jiuan froze.

The icy Thunderblade from their first meeting was now joking with her?

Her eyes lifted to the gate's plaque. "'Jiuan Pavilion'? How unimaginative."

In Cloudwater Manor, Ling Jiuzé seethed. "Why tolerate her insolence, Mother? That wretch has no respect!"

Madame Lan stroked the spirit rabbit in her lap. "She just brought honor to our family. Acting now would be unwise."

"Father's only putting on a show!" Ling Jiuzé spat. "Once the mystic realm expedition ends—"

"You couldn't even handle the man beside her." With a flick of her wrist, the rabbit yelped as it hit a pillar. "Anyone who trained a body-refining ninth-stage Ling Jiuan is no simple figure."

Ling Jiuzé's expression darkened. "You're suggesting..."

"Fetch your sister." Madame Lan's eyes narrowed. "This requires... careful planning."
###Chapter 312

"Ahhh—"

A piercing scream tore through the night.

Julian Langley jolted backward as if electrocuted, stumbling three meters away.

His back slammed against a tree trunk.

"Snake! There's a snake!"

His voice cracked with terror.

A pitch-black serpent coiled on the branch, its crimson tongue flicking in the air.

Its cold, vertical pupils locked onto him.

Julian's blood turned to ice.

He had always been terrified of slithering creatures.

The snake was barely ten centimeters from his nose.

He could even smell its musky, reptilian scent.

"Hiss—"

The serpent suddenly arched its body.

Julian's pupils constricted in panic.

At that critical moment—

A figure darted forward like lightning.

Evelyn Laurent's slender fingers clamped precisely behind the snake's head.

Thwack!

The serpent's tail lashed against her wrist, leaving a red welt.

She didn't even flinch.

With a swift motion, she hurled the snake through the air.

Whoosh—

It landed over a dozen meters away, smacking against a boulder.

The entire ordeal lasted less than three seconds.

By the time Ethan Sullivan rushed over, he only saw Evelyn shaking out her hand.

"Are you hurt?"

He grabbed her wrist, his thumb brushing the red mark.

Evelyn pulled away. "Just a scratch."

She turned to Julian, who was still trembling.

"Third Brother?"

She waved a hand in front of his dazed eyes.

Julian snapped back to reality.

"I'm fine!"

His voice was an octave higher than usual.

He straightened his posture with forced bravado, though his gaze kept darting toward where the snake had been flung.

Ethan suppressed a smirk. "Third Brother is quite brave."

"Of course!"

Julian lifted his chin defiantly.

"I just... found it disgusting."

Even as he spoke, he inched closer to Evelyn.

She bit back a smile.

Her third brother—

terrified out of his wits but still putting on a tough act.

"Let's go."

She looped her arm through Julian's, feeling the faint tremors in his muscles.

When she glanced back, she met Ethan's warm gaze.

Under the moonlight—

his eyes overflowed with tenderness.
###Chapter 313

Ethan Sullivan's smile deepened as Evelyn Laurent turned to look at him. He gave her a slight nod.

Her heart softened.

She saw unmistakable tenderness in his eyes.

He understood her concern.

She worried Julian Langley might walk too fast for him to keep up.

Only then did Evelyn turn away with relief.

Before long, hurried footsteps echoed ahead.

Timothy Gold and Eugene York rushed over with the production crew, their faces tense with worry.

"Julian!" Timothy dashed forward, gripping the Oscar-winning actor's arms to inspect him. "You scared us half to death—"

His voice trembled.

No one expected to hear a scream from the acclaimed actor in the dead of night.

Beatrice Quincy pushed through the crowd, panting. "Are you hurt?"

She reached for Julian's arm.

The concerned stares made his ears burn.

"Just...startled." He awkwardly rubbed his nose.

That snake had nearly brushed against his face.

Never in his life had he felt so humiliated.

Julian shot Ethan a warning glare.

A single word about this would mean death.

Ethan arched a brow, amusement flickering in his gaze.

The commotion soon settled.

Evelyn explained the snake was nonvenomous and harmless unless provoked.

But the seed of fear had been planted.

Beatrice tossed and turned all night.

Every time she closed her eyes, phantom snakes slithered by her bedside.

At dawn's first light, she gave up on sleep.

She turned to see Bianca Fairchild sleeping soundly beside her.

Her eyes turned icy.

She dug her nails into the tender flesh of Bianca's inner arm.
###Chapter 314

"Ah!"

Bianca Fairchild jolted awake, her forehead glistening with cold sweat. Beatrice Quincy's exquisitely beautiful yet twisted face loomed inches from hers.

"Sleeping well, were you?" Beatrice pinched the tender flesh on Bianca's inner arm, her nails digging deep. "I couldn't sleep all night while you snored like a hog."

Bianca clenched her teeth, not daring to make a sound. The burns on her back from last night still throbbed painfully, now compounded by this fresh torment.

"Y-young Mistress..." Her voice trembled.

Beatrice suddenly yanked her hair hard. Bianca saw stars, nearly blacking out from the pain.

"Know your place." Beatrice hissed in her ear, each word dripping with venom. "If you dare upstage me on this reality show..."

She left the threat unfinished, but Bianca knew the consequences. Her grandmother's hospital bills still depended on the Quincy family's generosity.

"I understand." Bianca lowered her head, nails biting into her palms.

Beatrice grabbed her chin, forcing eye contact. "I hear my brother is joining the show." Her lips curled into a sneer. "If I catch you near him..."

"I won't!" Bianca shook her head frantically, face ashen.

Beatrice shoved her away and smoothed her silk robe. "I'm going back to sleep. Stand right there." She glanced at the corner camera. "Face away. Don't let them notice anything."

Bianca obeyed silently. Her legs trembled from standing too long, but she didn't dare move.

Dawn light filtered through the window. The other guests would wake soon. Bianca caught her pale reflection in the mirror and nearly laughed at the absurdity.

This was her life—forever in Beatrice's shadow, where even breathing felt like a transgression.

When Beatrice rolled over, Bianca stiffened, careful not to make a sound.

"Get me water." The command came without Beatrice opening her eyes.

Bianca moved soundlessly. The water had to be the perfect temperature—a lesson learned through years of experience.

As she handed over the glass, Beatrice's eyes snapped open. "You know what I hate most about you?" She took the cup. "This pathetic obedience."

The glass shattered against the wall beside Bianca's head, spraying shards.

"Fetch another."

Kneeling to collect the fragments, Bianca nicked her fingers. The memory surfaced unbidden—that rainy night a decade ago when the Quincys took her in.

"This is your home now."

How bitterly ironic.
###Chapter 315

8:00 AM sharp.

The live stream flickered to life.

With winter break coinciding with the weekend, viewership skyrocketed instantly.

Timothy Gold's signature grin filled the screen first. "Good morning, everyone! Season Two of Love Retreat is officially underway. Let's check in on our guests' morning routines."

The camera followed the crew's footsteps down the hallway.

Crystal Rothschild's room was first.

She opened the door rubbing sleep from her eyes, her hair slightly tousled. Spotting the camera, she brightened with a sugary smile. "Morning~"

Her husky morning voice carried the lazy warmth of a waking Ragdoll cat.

"Ten minutes till assembly," a crew member whispered.

She nodded obediently. Behind her, rumpled bedding peeked through the door crack.

[OMG! Flawless even barefaced!]
[That complexion though!]
[Eyelash goddess alert!]

The chat exploded with adoration.

The next few guests appeared alert and camera-ready.

Until they reached Evelyn Laurent's door.

Three unanswered knocks.

Crystal approached with her toiletry bag, tilting her head. "Evelyn must still be asleep." A glint of satisfaction flashed in her eyes. "Should we wake the others first?"

Timothy checked his watch and moved on.

Beatrice Quincy's door swung open.

She stood there in lilac loungewear, her makeup red-carpet perfect. "Good morning, everyone~"

Turning, she called into the room, "Xander, time to rise."

Xander Quincy emerged with bedhead, muttered "Morning," and retreated into shadows.

[Talk about sibling contrast!]
[Civilians have zero professionalism.]
[Where's Julian?! Show us Julian!]

Dread coiled in Timothy's gut as they reached Julian Langley's door.

Still no response after three knocks.

Beatrice gasped. "Don't tell me—"

Eugene York's face darkened.

The final doorknob turned under everyone's gaze.
###Chapter 316

The salty morning breeze carried through the air as Xander Quincy brewed coffee in his cabin.

His door swung open to reveal Timothy Gold peering inside. "Where's Ethan Sullivan?"

Xander stirred his cup, steam curling around his fingers as he glanced up. "Morning jog."

[OMG Ethan's discipline is insane!]
[That physique maintenance though—I'm jealous.]
[This couch potato is retreating under the covers in shame.]

The Danmu exploded with chatter, but a few venomous comments stood out.

[Bet Evelyn Laurent is still asleep.]
[Rich heiresses are so spoiled.]

Victoria Langley slammed her tablet down. "Absolute nonsense!"

Richard Langley patted his wife's back but kept his eyes on the screen. "Just wait for the comeback."

Outside the beach cabin, Rachel Clemenson feigned surprise. "Ethan's so diligent."

Crystal Rothschild nodded, her gaze drifting to a closed door. "Evelyn must be—"

"Looking for me?"

A cool voice cut through the air. The camera whipped around to capture three figures striding through the dawn light.

Evelyn's high ponytail swayed as her athletic wear accentuated her slender waist. Ethan's shirt clung to his damp chest, while Julian Langley toweled off his sweat.

[Holy trio alert!]
[That clapback came faster than a tornado.]

Timothy exhaled in relief. "So you all—"

"Five years and seven months," Evelyn interrupted. "Every morning at 5:20."

Julian shot Rachel a withering look. "Some people have quite the imagination."

Crystal dug her nails into her palm, forcing a smile. "We were just concerned—"

"Initial supplies distribution starts now," Timothy rushed to redirect. "Complete tasks for bonus prize draws."

Crew members wheeled out a spinning wheel, its prize list glinting under the sun.

"Everyone gets one basic supply draw first," Timothy added, wiping his brow. "Safety first."

Ethan's voice sliced through the chatter. "Evelyn and I will share our prize draws."

The clearing fell silent.
###Chapter 317

The prize wheel began to spin, marking the official start of the show.

The guests stepped forward one by one to draw their survival supplies.

Beatrice Quincy's team finished first, obtaining a flashlight, water bottle, lighter, and rope.

Crystal Rothschild's team followed closely, drawing a Swiss Army Knife, sleeping bag, shovel, and flashlight.

When it was Evelyn Laurent's turn, the wheel's pointer landed on a sleeping bag, iron pot, rope, and shovel.

"Perfect!" A sly glint flashed in Evelyn's eyes.

With these supplies plus her island survival kit, it was practically a dream start.

Even three months here wouldn't be a problem, let alone ten days.

The other two teams, however, looked troubled.

"Only one sleeping bag—how are we supposed to share?" someone in Crystal's team muttered under their breath.

Timothy Gold seized the moment to extend an olive branch. "Teams dissatisfied with their supplies can earn more resources by completing tasks."

Beatrice was the first to step forward. "I'll draw a mission card."

She elegantly pulled out a card and read aloud, "Find five types of wild island berries?"

"The island has a rich variety of edible wild berries," Timothy explained with a smile.

"Piece of cake." Beatrice confidently tossed her hair.

Back with her team, she asked for opinions. "Should we complete this together, or each draw our own tasks?"

Liam Croix adjusted his glasses. "I suggest everyone draws one task, then we divide the work."

Soon, all four members of Beatrice's team had drawn their mission cards.

Crystal's team also stepped forward to draw theirs.

Only Evelyn's team remained motionless.

Xander Quincy leaned lazily against a tree, his gaze occasionally drifting toward Bianca Fairchild.

Julian Langley and Ethan Sullivan both turned to look at Evelyn.

"Director Gold," Evelyn suddenly asked, "what's the ultimate goal of this episode?"

"Survive ten days and build a base." Timothy revealed three cards. "These are the base assignment cards."

Evelyn casually drew one—Base Three.

Beatrice got Base One, while Crystal received Base Two.

The three teams followed the crew to their respective territories.

The bases weren't far apart—each was an open area enclosed by a fence.

Backed by large trees with clear visibility, they had high safety ratings.

Evelyn scanned the surroundings, a smile curling her lips. "We don't need to do tasks."

She was already planning how to transform this space.

Here, she wouldn't just survive—she'd create her own paradise.
###Chapter 318

Evelyn Laurent's eyes sparkled as she surveyed the island before her.

"I'm going to build a camp here!" she announced excitedly.

Julian Langley affectionately ruffled her hair. "Whatever you say."

Ethan Sullivan immediately chimed in. "I'm fully on board."

Xander Quincy twirled a branch absentmindedly. "Whatever."

Timothy Gold gaped at them. "You're seriously abandoning the production crew's mission?"

"Absolutely!" Evelyn was already making plans. "Third brother, go gather seafood by the shore. Ethan and Xander, collect firewood."

The live stream chat exploded.

[Are they insane? Ignoring the assigned mission?]

[Does she think this is some make-believe game?]

[And Julian just agreed like that?]

[Who does this woman think she is, ordering them around?]

Evelyn paid no attention to the skeptical comments, humming a tune as she walked toward the beach with Julian.

Ethan watched her retreating figure and sighed helplessly.

"Let's go," he said, patting Xander's shoulder.

A flood of question marks filled the chat.

[???]

[They're actually following her orders?]

[What's Evelyn's deal anyway?]

[Sleeping her way to the top?]

Victoria Langley trembled with rage reading these malicious comments.

She immediately typed: [Don't you dare talk about my daughter like that!]

But her message was quickly buried.

Then a golden comment suddenly dominated the screen:

[Evelyn is the seventh daughter of the Langley family. Julian is her biological brother. ID: Alexander Langley]

The entire live stream went wild.

[Holy shit!!!]

[The Langleys? Those Langleys?!]

[No wonder Julian dotes on her so much!]

The chat's tone instantly shifted.

Meanwhile on the island, Evelyn was barefoot on the sand, joyful as a songbird.
###Chapter 319

The live stream room fell into an eerie silence.

Every viewer stared at the screen in shock.

Evelyn Laurent was actually the seventh daughter of the Langley family?!

The netizens who had been spewing insults earlier panicked.

[I was wrong! I didn’t know she was a Langley heiress! Please don’t cancel me!]

[Alexander Langley and Evelyn look so alike—how could I have accused her of plastic surgery? I must be blind!]

[Forgive me, Miss Langley! I’ll never talk nonsense again!]

The danmu was instantly flooded with apologies.

With Alexander Langley’s verified account personally stepping in, who would dare doubt the truth?

[Lillian Rothschild V: Scared now? Weren’t you having fun insulting her earlier? Keep going!]

Lillian and her friends unleashed a verbal assault.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she single-handedly crushed the anti-fans.

Alexander’s appearance was like a bucket of ice water, instantly extinguishing all the malice.

The danmu finally quieted down.

No one dared to utter another word about Evelyn.

Everyone in the industry knew the Langley patriarch’s ruthless reputation.

Crossing him meant an early end to one’s career.

Victoria Langley smirked in satisfaction.

Her eldest son had performed well this time.

Meanwhile, on the beach—

Evelyn ran barefoot across the sand.

The receding tide had left behind countless treasures.

Julian Langley trailed behind her with a cast-iron pot, grinning like an excited child.

"Evelyn! Look at this crab!"

"Wow! This fish is still flopping!"

"This seashell is gorgeous!"

Evelyn crouched down and poked the crab’s waving claws.

The turquoise waves lapped at her ankles.

Colorful starfish glittered under the sunlight.

This uninhabited island’s ecosystem was astonishingly pristine.

Julian had already gathered half a pot of seafood.

"Evelyn, are you sure all of this is edible?"

She blinked.

This was her first time beachcombing too.
###Chapter 320

Golden sunlight bathed the beach as gentle waves lapped at the shore. Evelyn Laurent and Julian Langley bent over, collecting seafood left behind by the receding tide. Their plastic bucket already held several crabs and shells.

Light footsteps approached from a distance.

Beatrice Quincy and Bianca Fairchild walked over, carrying the small red buckets provided by the production crew. Beatrice's eyes immediately landed on Julian's tall, straight-backed figure.

"Julian!" Her face lit up as she hurried forward.

Julian turned at the sound of her voice, instinctively hiding the pot filled with seafood behind him.

"You've gathered quite a haul," Beatrice remarked, her gaze lingering on the pot with a flicker of longing.

"This belongs to me and Evelyn," Julian replied coolly, taking a step closer to Evelyn.

Beatrice's smile froze. Her fingers tightened around the bucket handle.

"Of course I wouldn't take what's yours," she forced out, her voice trembling slightly.

Julian didn't respond, turning back to Evelyn, who was still gathering shells.

The cameras caught Beatrice's reddened eyes as she whispered to herself, "You can do this, Beatrice. Keep going."

[My heart aches for Beatrice! Julian is so cold to her.]
[Did Evelyn say something behind the scenes?]
[Wake up! Julian clearly doesn't want anything to do with Beatrice.]
[@LangleyLover: Taking notes on every ID that badmouths Evelyn~]

Suddenly, a bold message flashed across the livestream:

[Evelyn Laurent is the legitimate seventh daughter of the Langley family. Watch your words.]

The chat fell silent for a few seconds.

[Beatrice is the Quincy family's eldest daughter too!]
[Exactly! She's pursued Julian for so long. How can he treat her like this?]

On the beach, Beatrice took a deep breath and turned toward a rocky area. She crouched down, pretending to search for seafood, but her nails dug deep into her palms.
###Chapter 321

Beatrice Quincy's live stream erupted into chaos.

The comment section exploded with frenzied activity as two factions of fans clashed relentlessly.

Julian Langley's stans unleashed their fury:
"Got no shame, Beatrice?"
"Stop throwing yourself at our idol. Disgusting."
"Rejected a thousand times and still chasing him? Pathetic."

Beatrice's loyalists fired back:
"What kind of man is Julian anyway?"
"Too blind to see how amazing Beatrice is."
"Emotionless monster. Deserves to die alone."

Alexander Langley glanced at his phone screen and smirked.

His brother getting roasted? Whatever.

But if anyone dared insult his sister, he'd make them regret being born.

On the beach, Beatrice bit back tears.

Her nails dug into her palms as she clutched the plastic bucket.

The crab tongs felt awkward in her grip, each movement like torture.

Yet her gaze remained glued to Julian's retreating figure.

The shoreline had already been picked clean.

Bianca Fairchild approached timidly. "Should we try over there, sis?"

Her voice was barely audible.

A glacial glint flashed in Beatrice's eyes before she beamed sweetly. "How thoughtful, Bianca. Lead the way."

Bianca stiffened.

She walked ahead with rigid posture, head bowed.

Beatrice trailed leisurely behind, deliberately targeting spots Bianca had already searched.

Their buckets told contrasting stories.

Bianca's held only a few scattered shells.

Beatrice's overflowed with treasures.

"Oh my!" Beatrice suddenly gasped.

Kneeling, she cooed at a palm-sized crab with saccharine delight. "So adorable~"

Her fingertip grazed the crustacean's claw.

A bloodcurdling shriek ripped through the air.

"AAAAH—"

Beatrice flailed wildly as the crab clamped onto her index finger.

Crimson droplets splattered the sand.

Bianca lunged forward, expertly prying the claw open.

"Sis, you're supposed to avoid the pincers..."

Her voice faded to a whisper.

Cold sweat drenched her back.

Beatrice blinked tearfully. "Thank you, Bianca."

But those glistening eyes burned with venom.

This little bitch!

She knew the danger and left it for me on purpose?
###Chapter 322

A crimson drop of blood welled up on Beatrice Quincy's fingertip, glaringly vivid under the sunlight.

Her nails dug deep into her palms as she stared fixedly at the tiny wound.

This had to be that bitch Bianca Fairchild's doing!

"Beatrice, are you okay?" Bianca timidly offered a tissue.

Beatrice slapped her hand away, flashing a saccharine smile. "I'm fine, thanks for asking."

The crew rushed over, relieved to see it was just a minor cut.

The live chat exploded.

[Oh my god, Beatrice's hand! Why didn't the crew provide gloves?!]

[Who's to blame for poking a crab without common sense?]

[Bianca is so sweet, helping her with the wound.]

A shadow flickered in Beatrice's eyes as she glimpsed the comments.

She turned toward the shallows, deliberately stomping through Bianca's carefully collected pile of seashells.

"Oops, my bad." She blinked innocently.

Bianca silently knelt to gather the scattered shells again.

The salty sea breeze whipped against their faces.

Meanwhile, in another part of the bay...

Evelyn Laurent stood knee-deep in the water, rolling up her pants. The wooden spear she'd sharpened with her combat knife glinted coldly in the sun.

"Miss Evelyn is spearfishing? That's so badass!"

Julian Langley hugged an iron pot, his eyes sparkling like stars.

A school of fish drifted lazily past.

Evelyn struck—her spear slicing through the water.

Two silvery fish writhed on the wooden shaft, their tails flapping desperately.

"Only two?" She pursed her lips in dissatisfaction.

The chat flooded with awe.

[That was insane!]

[What kind of goddess is Evelyn Laurent?!]

[Others are still picking shells while she's out here catching dinner.]

Evelyn shook her damp bangs away, locking onto a denser school further out.

"Bro, we're having extra tonight."

A smirk curled her lips as she twirled the knife deftly between her fingers.
###Chapter 323

"Evelyn!" Julian Langley's eyes widened, nearly dropping the large pot in his hands. "You actually caught fish like that?"

He jumped excitedly on the spot before remembering he was still holding the pot, plopping down onto the sand and slapping the beach in disbelief. "This is incredible!"

The live stream's chat exploded instantly.

[What kind of god-tier move was that?!]

[I couldn't even do that in a video game!]

[Did Evelyn Laurent just cheat? Two fish at once?]

Evelyn remained composed, casually tossing the fish into the pot. "No big deal."

When she was eight, after her cousin's family moved away, the villagers occasionally helped, but most of the time, she had to fend for herself. Fishing in the river, setting traps for rabbits—these survival skills were ingrained in her bones.

"Teach me!" Julian's eyes sparkled as he stared at the sharpened wooden spear in her hand. "That move was amazing!"

Nearby, Beatrice Quincy clenched her fists.

This Evelyn was stealing the spotlight again. She watched the siblings' close interaction coldly, her nails digging into her palms.

"Xander, let's go." She picked up the basket filled with seafood, her voice tight with suppressed anger.

The ocean water was icy.

Julian shivered the moment he stepped in. "Evelyn, aren't you cold?"

"Used to it." She scattered some biscuit crumbs. "The fish will swim this way. You need to account for the refraction angle underwater."

The live audience held their breath.

[The Oscar-winning actor looks so serious.]

[I bet five bucks he misses.]

[I can't even breathe watching this.]

The school of fish approached slowly.

Julian held his breath, muscles tensed, and thrust the spear the moment the fish swam past—

"Splash!"

Water sprayed everywhere.

The fish scattered in panic.

The spear came up empty.
###Chapter 324

Julian Langley stood knee-deep in the stream, raising a wooden stick high before bringing it down with a splash.

"Missed again?" He stared at the water, disbelief coloring his voice.

Evelyn Laurent crouched on the bank, cleaning the fish she'd just speared. She glanced up at the commotion.

"Water refracts light, Julian," she said softly. "Aim slightly below where you see the fish."

Julian scratched his head and adjusted his stance. He took a deep breath, his focus sharp as if executing a critical mission.

First strike—water sprayed everywhere.
Second strike—the fish flicked its tail.
Third strike—the stick grazed scales.

"This defies physics!" Julian stared at his empty stick, shoulders slumping.

Evelyn tossed her fifth fish into the pot. Her movements were swift, each strike precise.

The live stream chat exploded:

[LMAO Julian's face is priceless]
[Is Evelyn cheating?]
[This is brutal hahaha]

Xander Quincy and Ethan Sullivan approached from a distance, taking in the scene.

"What's Julian doing?" Xander called out. "Practicing aquatic ballet?"

Ethan's gaze settled on Evelyn, his lips curving upward. But at Xander's words, his expression cooled instantly.

"What did you call her?" Ethan's voice dropped low.

Xander stiffened. "M-Miss Laurent?"

"Hmm." Ethan's acknowledgment was curt, his attention returning to Evelyn.

She looked up just then, meeting his eyes. With a bright smile, she held up her latest catch.

The chat went wild:

[OMG THAT EYE CONTACT]
[Ethan's gaze could melt glaciers]
[Someone call a priest—I'm witnessing holiness]

Julian remained oblivious to the tension onshore, still battling the stream. He raised his stick for the nth time, his expression tragically determined.

"I refuse to accept defeat!"
###Chapter 325

Sunlight danced on the ocean waves, casting shimmering reflections.

The live stream chat exploded with rapid-fire messages flooding the screen—endless variations of "So sweet!"

Victoria Langley sat before the monitor, an unconscious smile tugging at her lips.

She shook her head slightly. "That boy..."

Ethan Sullivan's devotion to Evelyn Laurent surpassed even her wildest expectations.

When the mystery guest was revealed to be Ethan, her breath hitched.

The CEO of Sullivan Group had abandoned his empire to chase Evelyn onto a reality show set.

He'd even become the program's primary sponsor.

Richard Langley narrowed his eyes.

Ethan's arrival came as no surprise.

That young man wasn't the type to surrender easily.

Once he recognized his own feelings, the elders wouldn't stand in his way.

But those six brothers...

Richard lifted his teacup, lips quirking upward.

Consider this Ethan's trial.

Without the brothers' approval, Evelyn would never say yes.

And more importantly...

Evelyn herself remained blissfully oblivious.

Ethan's path would be long and arduous.

May he have the perseverance to endure.

Waves crashed against the shoreline.

Julian Langley whirled at the sound of approaching footsteps.

Xander Quincy and Ethan were walking toward the beach.

His eyes gleamed as he raised a wooden spear. "Care to try spearfishing?"

His gaze locked onto Ethan.

Take the bait.

Make a fool of yourself.

Xander already rolled up his pant legs with enthusiasm. "I'm in!"

Ethan methodically folded back his sleeves.

The motion carried the elegance of a gala dinner.

"Coming, third brother."

He waded into the surf, heading straight for Evelyn.

"The water's cold. Let me."

His voice dripped with honeyed warmth.

Evelyn thrust the spear forward without hesitation. "Do you even know how?"

Ethan shook his head, gaze intent. "Teach me?"

Julian lunged between them. "I'll teach you!"

No alone time for these two.

Ethan's eyes flicked to the iron pot onshore.

Eight fish lay in perfect alignment, each pierced through identical spots.

Clearly Evelyn's handiwork.

He turned to Julian with earnest curiosity. "Does third brother's method actually work?"

Julian's face froze.

That bastard!
###Chapter 326

Julian Langley shot Ethan Sullivan a murderous glare, about to lash out when Evelyn Laurent's clear voice cut through. "Let me demonstrate."

She motioned for them to step back, gripping the wooden spear firmly as she waded into the shallows.

Gentle waves lapped at her ankles.

As a school of fish darted past, her wrist flicked with lightning speed. The spear plunged into the water.

Two plump fish writhed on the spear's tip, their tails flapping desperately.

"See how it's done?" She lifted the spear, sunlight refracting through the droplets clinging to it.

Ethan watched the sea breeze tousle her hair, a faint smile curving his lips. "Mm."

Xander Quincy eagerly grabbed the spear and charged into the water.

Julian lounged on the sand, smirking. "Good luck with that."

He knew exactly how difficult spearfishing could be.

Evelyn shook her head and turned to gather firewood.

Her combat knife flashed as she swiftly assembled a makeshift grill.

"Going to cook the fish?" Julian sidled up.

"Yes. Everyone's hungry." Her hands moved deftly scaling the fish.

Julian frowned. "No fire starter."

"I've got it covered." She didn't look up.

"Beatrice's team has a lighter," Julian suggested.

Evelyn's hands stilled. "Send Xander to borrow it."

She didn't want her brother getting involved with Beatrice Quincy.

Julian's eyes lit up. He called toward the water, "Xander! Evelyn needs you to get a lighter!"

The struggling spearfisherman turned with a scowl. "Why don't you go yourself?"
###Chapter 327

Julian Langley stood on the beach with his hands in his pockets, a roguish grin playing on his lips. "You're Beatrice and Bianca's actual brother. Of course you should go. Who am I to them?"

He deliberately emphasized the words "actual brother."

Evelyn had secretly tugged his sleeve earlier, signaling him not to go.

The thought of his little sister protecting him made Julian's chest swell with pride. His smug expression was unmistakable.

[LOL Julian's ego is through the roof!]

[Evelyn is so sweet. She totally knows he doesn't want to deal with Beatrice.]

[What's up with the Quincy siblings? Why isn't Xander teamed up with his sisters?]

[The other group is already eating instant noodles. Why aren't they doing tasks to exchange supplies?]

The live chat buzzed with comments.

Xander Quincy's face darkened.

He knew exactly how Beatrice felt about Julian—and how determinedly Julian avoided her.

What frustrated him more was his family's increasing indulgence toward Beatrice, especially when it came to Bianca...

Just thinking about Bianca made his chest tighten.

"No," he said coldly.

Ethan Sullivan shot him a sharp look.

Xander immediately backtracked. "Just kidding. I'll go!"

He grabbed a wooden stick and charged toward the shore like a man fleeing demons.

Julian burst out laughing, slapping his thigh. "Look at you now, Xander!"

[OMG Julian's smug face is everything!]

[Ethan just silenced Xander with one look. Protective husband confirmed!]

[What's Xander's deal? Borrowing a lighter shouldn't be this painful.]

[Something's off about the Quincy siblings.]

The audience quickly picked up on the tension.

Evelyn suddenly spoke up. "Wait."

She deftly skewered four fish. "Take these to trade."

"That many?" Julian protested, wincing at the loss.

Evelyn glanced at the ocean. "Don't worry. There will be more fish."

When her gaze briefly met Ethan's, Julian bristled.

"Watch this, Evie!" He grabbed a stick and charged into the water. "I'll spear a big one for you!"

Evelyn shook her head with a faint smile and continued cleaning the fish.

After gutting them, she stood and dusted off her hands. "I'm going to find some herbs in the woods."

###Chapter 328

Sunlight danced on the ocean waves, casting shimmering reflections. Ethan Sullivan stood in the shallows, his hawk-like gaze locked onto a dark shadow gliding beneath the water.

With a flick of his wrist, his wooden spear shot through the surface like an arrow.

A plump fish was impaled with perfect precision, water droplets cascading from its thrashing tail.

"Evelyn." He turned with his prize, warmth softening his sharp features. "Look."

Julian Langley crouched nearby, his own spear striking empty water again. His eyes widened at Ethan's catch.

"That's impossible!" he muttered through gritted teeth, stabbing the water with renewed frustration.

The fish had already darted away, leaving only splashes in its wake.

Evelyn Laurent stood barefoot on the sand, her sundress fluttering in the sea breeze. A radiant smile curved her lips as she watched Ethan. "Brilliant!"

Her gaze shifted to her pouting older brother, and a soft laugh escaped her.

Julian whirled around with wounded indignation. "You're playing favorites, Evie!"

"Brother," she blinked innocently, "maybe try a different spot?"

"The woods!" He tossed his spear aside and bounded to her side. "I'll protect you!"

His brave declaration faltered slightly at the word "woods," his shoulders hunching reflexively.

Ethan placed the fish in a bucket onshore. "Be careful," he said gently.

"Will do!" Evelyn waved, her dress swirling in a graceful arc as she turned.

Julian shot Ethan a triumphant smirk, looking every bit the child who'd won the last cookie.

The live chat exploded:

[OMG Ethan's gaze at Evelyn is EVERYTHING!]
[Julian's so adorable pretending not to be scared of snakes!]
[This love triangle is GOLD! I ship it!]
[Ethan's spearfishing skills are unreal!]
[Julian right now: Why am I third-wheeling?]

The sun stretched their three shadows across the sand. Gentle waves lapped the shore like a tender lullaby.
###Chapter 329

"I'm dying! What kind of ship name is 'Ethan-Evelyn'? Does Ethan Sullivan know you're doing this?"

The live stream chat exploded with messages, the engagement skyrocketing.

The five Langley brothers stared at the screen, faces turning green.

Sebastian Langley gritted his teeth. "Don't these netizens have anything better to do?"

Nathaniel Langley silently pulled out his phone. "I'm reporting this stream."

Dominic Langley smirked. "What's your reason? 'Defaming our sister'?"

Victoria Langley laughed so hard she slapped her thigh. "Oh my god, these kids are geniuses! Ethan-Evelyn ship? Hilarious!"

Richard Langley patted his wife's back. "It just means the audience loves their dynamic."

Victoria lifted her chin proudly. "Of course! Our Evelyn is adorable!"

In the woods, Evelyn Laurent bent down to gather wild greens.

Julian Langley followed closely, his eyes darting nervously through the underbrush.

"Julian," Evelyn suddenly turned, "what are you looking for?"

He startled. "N-nothing!"

Evelyn suppressed a smile. "Snakes rarely come out during the day."

Julian immediately straightened. "Who's scared of snakes? I was just... admiring the scenery!"

His foot slipped mid-sentence, nearly sending him tumbling.

Evelyn caught him effortlessly. "Careful."

Julian's ears turned red. "Thanks, Evie..."

As they continued walking, Julian suddenly brightened.

"Evie, look!" He pointed at a cluster of bright red mushrooms under a tree. "Are these edible?"

Evelyn glanced over. "Sure."

Julian eagerly reached out. "Then we can—"

"End up in the ICU immediately after eating them," Evelyn added casually.

Julian froze mid-reach.

Three seconds later, he stomped the mushrooms violently. "Why do poisonous things have to look so pretty? Scammers!"

Evelyn burst out laughing.

She picked some dull grayish mushrooms instead. "These are the edible ones."

Julian peered at them. "Ugly means safe, right?"

"Exactly," Evelyn nodded. "The uglier, the safer."

Julian considered this. "Then I must be extremely safe."

Evelyn: "......"

She silently added the mushrooms to her basket, thinking her brother's logic was truly one-of-a-kind.

Too bad the island lacked proper seasonings—the dish could've been more flavorful.

Julian suddenly leaned in. "Evie, what if we name that snake?"

Evelyn: "???"

His abrupt topic change left her mentally scrambling.
###Chapter 330

Evelyn Laurent and Julian Langley strolled leisurely along the forest path, gathering a bounty of wild edibles without realizing it.

The mushrooms were plump and fresh, the wild greens vibrant, and the berries ripe and tempting—enough to feed four people.

"Julian! What a coincidence!"

Rachel Clemenson's sudden exclamation shattered the forest's tranquility. She and her brother Leo approached, drawing curious glances from Crystal Rothschild and Hugo Rothschild.

Julian remained composed, offering only a slight nod in acknowledgment.

"Are you two foraging too?" Rachel eyed the bundle wrapped in Julian's jacket with interest.

The makeshift pouch bulged with an assortment of wild treasures. Rachel's smile froze as she pointed at a few mushrooms.

"Oh my god! Those are poisonous! They could kill you! Throw them away!"

Julian instinctively stepped back, shielding the bundle. "If Evelyn says they're safe, then they are."

Rachel gaped at him, incredulous. She'd done her research—Evelyn was just some country bumpkin with no credentials. How could an Oscar-winning actor trust her judgment?

"Julian, I'm serious! Those mushrooms are deadly!" Rachel insisted. "Leo and I grew up in the countryside. We know these things."

Leo nodded vigorously. "Yeah, we call those 'Devil's Bane.' One bite is enough to kill you."

Evelyn stood quietly, a faint smile playing on her lips. She plucked one mushroom from the bundle, twirling it between her fingers.

"Are you sure?" Her voice was soft but laced with unshakable confidence.

Rachel bristled at her tone. "Evelyn, stop pretending you know what you're doing! This is a matter of life and death!"

Tension crackled in the air. Crystal watched from a distance, amusement flickering in her eyes, while Hugo studied the mushroom in Evelyn's hand thoughtfully.

Julian suddenly chuckled. "I trust Evelyn's judgment." He turned to her, his gaze warm and resolute. "Let's head back. It's time to start lunch."

Rachel's face flushed with frustration. She'd hoped to showcase her survival skills on camera, only to have Julian side with Evelyn so decisively.

"You'll regret this!" she called after them.

Evelyn waved without looking back. "Thanks for your concern." Her tone was breezy, as if discussing the weather.

The pair walked away, leaving the Clemenson siblings standing there. Leo muttered, "Do you think they'll really eat those poisonous mushrooms?"

Rachel gritted her teeth. "Let's see them make fools of themselves!" She was already plotting how to play the compassionate expert if Evelyn got poisoned.

Meanwhile, Evelyn murmured to Julian, "Those are called 'Scarlet Caps.' They are toxic."

Julian paused mid-step. "Then why—"

"But I know how to prepare them safely." Evelyn flashed a mysterious smile. "You'll see."

From afar, Crystal watched their retreating figures, stroking her chin thoughtfully. This mushroom dispute seemed far more layered than it appeared.
###Chapter 331

Leo Clemenson spoke with absolute conviction. Julian Langley instinctively turned to Evelyn Laurent.

Evelyn's expression remained cool as her gaze swept over the Clemenson siblings. "Not poisonous."

During her years in the countryside, she had often accompanied village elders into the mountains to forage.

Years of experience had honed her sharp eye.

Identifying toxic mushrooms was as natural to her as breathing.

Rachel Clemenson stomped her foot in frustration. "Evelyn, these are death caps! They're lethal!"

She lunged forward, trying to snatch the mushrooms from Julian's arms.

Crystal Rothschild stepped in swiftly, with Hugo Rothschild close behind, his dark eyes unreadable.

Leo wore a pained expression. "Mr. Langley, this is a matter of life and death!"

Evelyn's eyes turned icy. "I said they're not poisonous."

"What do you know?" Leo scoffed, his anger boiling over. "We grew up in the mountains. Do you really think you know better?"

His righteous indignation made it seem as though Evelyn was deliberately trying to harm them.

[I'm so anxious! The Clemensons definitely know more about mushrooms!]

[Someone stop them before it's too late!]

Evelyn's livestream remained relatively calm, but the Clemensons' chatroom exploded.

[Who does Evelyn think she is, acting all high and mighty?]

[Is she trying to get everyone killed?]

[Where did the production team even find this lunatic?]

[She deserves the hate! Pretending to be an expert!]

The barrage of comments grew increasingly hostile.

Timothy Gold and the crew came sprinting over, his voice trembling through the walkie-talkie. "Stop them! Don't let them eat it!"

Sweat dripped down his forehead as if he could already see his career ending.

Evelyn's sharp gaze pierced Rachel. "The ones pretending to know are you."

Her eyes flicked to the wild berries in Rachel's hand, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "Then tell me, what are these?"

Rachel puffed out her chest. "They're mountain berries! Common where we're from!"

Evelyn let out a cold laugh, her eyes glinting with frost.
###Chapter 332

Rachel Clemenson picked up a bright red wild berry and waved it in front of the camera.

"I've already tasted these. They're safe to eat," she said, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

That fool Evelyn Laurent was asking for humiliation.

"Brave," Evelyn suddenly chuckled, giving a thumbs-up.

Leo Clemenson immediately jumped in.

"Evelyn, what's your problem? My sister warned you about the poisonous mushrooms, and now you're accusing us of picking toxic berries?"

Evelyn ignored him and turned away.

"Julian, let's go."

Julian Langley shot the Clemenson siblings a cold glare before following.

Their malicious intentions were obvious.

"Wait!" Rachel panicked. "Those mushrooms really are poisonous! Who'll take responsibility if something happens?"

Timothy Gold hurried over with a bespectacled man in tow.

"I'm a botanist," the man said, immediately examining the mushrooms in Julian's hands.

Beads of sweat formed on his forehead.

The island had been cleared of toxic mushrooms before filming. How had any been missed?

After a thorough inspection, he exhaled in relief.

"These are Termitomyces. They're edible."

Rachel and Leo paled.

Impossible! Those mushrooms were supposed to be—

"Could you check the berries they picked too?" Evelyn interjected.

The botanist took the red fruit and his expression instantly darkened.

"These are Nandina berries. They're toxic and can cause severe abdominal pain!"

Crystal Rothschild clapped a hand over her mouth in horror.

"I... I ate several..."

Her terrified gaze locked onto the Clemenson siblings.

They'd said the berries were safe!

"Julian, let's go." Evelyn walked away without looking back.

Timothy stomped his foot in frustration.

"Call a doctor, now!"

Rachel's legs gave out as a sharp, stabbing pain tore through her abdomen.
###Chapter 333

The live stream room fell into an eerie silence.

Rachel and Leo Clemenson's fans were struck dumb. The danmu section went completely blank.

All those arrogant comments might as well have never existed.

Who could have predicted Evelyn Laurent's mushrooms would be perfectly safe, while the Clemenson siblings' "guaranteed harmless" red berries turned out to be poisonous?

This was the ultimate humiliation.

[Where's all that big talk now? Cat got your tongue?]

[Survival experts raised in the mountains can't even identify toxic plants? Pathetic.]

[Rachel and Leo owe Evelyn a public apology!]

Crystal Rothschild's fans flooded the chat, drowning out everything else with their outrage.

The Clemensons' supporters didn't dare show their faces.

With their idols so thoroughly disgraced, what could they possibly say?

Rachel's mocking "fake it till you make it" comment now rang painfully ironic.

On the beach, Evelyn and Julian Langley returned with full baskets.

Ethan Sullivan remained waist-deep in the ocean, his spear now laden with plump fish.

"That's enough. Come ashore." Evelyn frowned at the figure in the water.

How could anyone stay submerged for hours like some aquatic creature?

Ethan turned, water droplets glistening in his hair. He gave her a tender smile. "As you wish."

Julian swiftly inserted himself between them, thrusting their haul forward. "Look at this!"

Ethan's gaze swept over the provisions. "Impressive work, Evelyn. And you too, Julian."

Julian snorted. The man's silver tongue was getting sharper by the day.

Unaware of their silent battle, Evelyn deftly wrapped the fish in broad leaves, coating them with freshly gathered herb paste.

By the fire, she expertly turned the grilling fish. Nearby, a stone pot bubbled with seafood stew.

Director Timothy Gold hurried over. "Aren't you trading these for supplies?"

"You don't have fresh water, seasonings, or sleeping bags!"

Evelyn didn't look up. "Random draws are too risky. Direct trades are better."

She met his gaze with a faint smile. "We'll offer extra seafood for specific items."

The crew's meals probably depended on the contestants' catches anyway.
###Chapter 334

Evelyn Laurent weighed the heavy seafood harvest in her hands, a sly smile curling her lips. These fresh catches straight from the ocean were far more tempting than the production crew's hardtack.

"Deputy Director Gold, we'd like to make an exchange." She shook the fishing net in her hand.

Timothy Gold's forehead glistened with sweat. She was the third guest group coming to barter, but this one was clearly more formidable.

"A lighter, tent, seasonings, and a cooking pot." Evelyn counted on her fingers. "I'll go catch more if this isn't enough."

She turned toward the shoreline, but Timothy hastily stopped her. "That's sufficient!"

Julian Langley watched in astonishment. Since when had his little sister become such a skilled negotiator?

Ethan Sullivan silently accepted the traded supplies, efficiently setting up the tent. His slender fingers gleamed pale in the sunlight, each movement precise as a performance.

"Third Brother, go help Xander Quincy start the fire." Evelyn didn't even look up.

Julian's eyes widened in protest. "Why me?"

"Because your grilled fish is inedible." Evelyn delivered the blunt truth.

The faintest smirk touched Ethan's lips—just enough for Julian to catch. Their gazes clashed midair, sparks flying.

"Evelyn Laurent."

A cool voice interrupted their silent standoff. Hugo Rothschild stood three meters away, holding several water bottles. The sea breeze lifted the hem of his gray tracksuit, making him resemble an unsheathed blade.

Ethan instantly positioned himself in front of Evelyn, his gaze sharp.

"A token of gratitude." Hugo's words were brief, but his eyes bypassed Ethan, locking onto Evelyn. There was something about this girl—a fire that drew people in.

"Unnecessary." Evelyn kept her focus on the sizzling fish she was turning.

Hugo's brow furrowed slightly. No one had ever dismissed him so outright.

"Leave." Ethan's voice was ice.

The sea wind turned biting, whipping up grains of sand. As their eyes met, the very air seemed to freeze.
###Chapter 335

The air crackled with unspoken tension.

Hugo Rothschild stood three paces away from Ethan Sullivan.

Ethan's dark eyes gleamed with icy intensity. His chin lifted slightly, gaze sharp as a blade, radiating clear warning.

Hugo remained impassive, though a trace of confusion flickered in his brow. His cool demeanor contrasted starkly with Ethan's simmering hostility.

Julian Langley hovered nearby, watching Hugo with wary eyes. He'd noticed something unsettling in the way this aloof man looked at his sister.

"I came to thank Evelyn Laurent," Hugo said calmly. "This doesn't concern you, Mr. Sullivan."

Ethan smirked. "She said she doesn't need your thanks."

Their locked gazes sparked like flint on steel.

Hugo narrowed his eyes. "This is between her and me."

He took a step forward, only to be blocked by Ethan's unyielding stance.

"Enough." Evelyn gently tugged Ethan's sleeve.

She met Hugo's gaze squarely. "I told you it wasn't necessary."

Ignoring her, Hugo set four water bottles on the ground. "You're low on supplies."

Without another word, he turned and walked away.

Ethan stared at the bottles, expression darkening. Every instinct rebelled against this stranger's sudden appearance.

Evelyn distributed the water to their group. "We'll use these for now."

Ethan twisted open a cap and handed it to her. "You first."

She hesitated before accepting.

Julian shot Ethan an annoyed glare and gulped down half his bottle in one go.

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted as he watched Evelyn drink, his gaze softening.

The aroma of grilled fish wafted through the air.

Evelyn focused on turning the fish, sprinkling seasonings with practiced ease. Firelight danced across her concentrated profile.
###Chapter 336

The aroma of grilled fish wafted through the sea breeze, its golden crispy skin hiding tender, juicy flesh.

The four of them sat around the campfire, eagerly devouring their hard-earned breakfast. Evelyn Laurent deftly skewered freshly caught fish onto sticks and turned them over the flames.

Mushroom soup bubbled in the iron pot, its rich fragrance filling the air.

[Help! This scene is too tempting! I can practically smell it through the screen!]

[Oscar-winning actor Julian is eating like there's no tomorrow—he's totally abandoned his image, LOL!]

[The other two groups are still chewing on hardtack while these guys are feasting on seafood. The gap is insane!]

Ethan Sullivan subtly placed the fattiest portion of fish onto Evelyn's plate.

Julian Langley caught the gesture instantly, his brows furrowing.

"Does the production crew need to switch bowls?" Evelyn waved her fragrant grilled fish, prompting a staff member to scurry over with fresh utensils.

After the meal, Ethan naturally stood to clean up.

His slender fingers dipped in seawater as he meticulously scrubbed every corner of the iron pot.

Evelyn rested her chin in her palm, her gaze unconsciously following his movements.

"Evelyn, what's our next move?" Julian stepped squarely between them, blocking his sister's line of sight.

The sea breeze rustled through the coconut trees.

Evelyn scanned their surroundings and made a quick decision. "Xander Quincy and you will gather firewood. Ethan and I will scout ahead."

She mentally noted the need for vines to weave sleeping mats and the best spot to build a shelter.

"No!" Julian's refusal was absolute. "I'm going with you!"

He glared at Ethan like a mother hen protecting her chick.

Ethan calmly shook water droplets from his fingers, a faint smirk playing on his lips—only fueling Julian's unease.

[LMAO Julian's overprotective brother act is killing me!]

[The showdown we've been waiting for! I live for this tension!]

Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples. "Julian, this is the most efficient division of labor."

What she didn't say was that Ethan's survival skills far surpassed her brother's.

Amid the cries of seagulls, the group split into two teams.

Ethan led the way, glancing back periodically to ensure Evelyn's safety.

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting a golden glow over them as they moved.
###Chapter 337

Julian Langley stepped forward swiftly, shielding Evelyn Laurent.

"Ethan just gathered branches with Xander Quincy. He has experience now." His tone was earnest. "Let me go with you. Ethan can stay here collecting wood."

Evelyn shook her head gently. "No."

The dense vegetation ahead might harbor snakes.

She remembered Julian's crippling fear of serpents.

Besides, Ethan's combat skills would ensure their safety.

Julian's expression crumpled instantly.

His peach-blossom eyes shimmered, the corners tinged pink. "Evie, why?"

The live chat erupted.

[Help! That wounded puppy look is killing me!]
[Our Oscar-winning actor looks utterly heartbroken!]
[How does he make misery look so gorgeous?]

Evelyn's resolve wavered, but she held firm. "Third Brother, there might be snakes there."

Julian's pupils contracted violently.

Then his face lit up. "You're worried about me?"

"Of course."

His grin turned triumphant as he shot Ethan a smug glance before scowling again. "Ethan Sullivan, you'd better protect her with your life!"

"I will." Ethan's promise carried solemn weight.

His gaze softened as it lingered on Evelyn, tenderness pooling in his eyes.

With an exasperated sigh, Evelyn grabbed her combat knife and headed into the woods with Ethan.

The drone buzzed overhead as crew members trailed cautiously behind.

"What are we looking for?" Ethan kept his voice low.

His attention never strayed from Evelyn's retreating figure.

"Vines." She pushed through waist-high grass. "For weaving sleeping mats."

No way would she let anyone sleep on bare ground.

Insects rustled through the undergrowth. Evelyn moved with measured caution.

Ethan shadowed her silently, poised to intervene at the first sign of danger.
###Chapter 338

Sunlight filtered through the dense forest canopy. Evelyn Laurent narrowed her eyes, quickly spotting the thicket of vines ahead.

"Found it," she murmured, already moving toward the target.

Ethan Sullivan followed without hesitation. They worked in perfect sync—she on the left, he on the right.

Evelyn's combat knife gleamed coldly as she sliced through the vines with ruthless efficiency. Each swing severed the tough plants effortlessly.

Ethan gathered the cuttings, his long fingers deftly weaving them into bundles. Their coordination was seamless.

Sweat trickled down Evelyn's temple.

"My turn." Ethan suddenly gripped her wrist, his voice firm.

Evelyn arched a brow. "These vines are tougher than they look."

"Let me try." He took the knife without waiting.

The blade met resistance immediately. Ethan's muscles tensed as he strained, but his pace lagged far behind Evelyn's.

[OMG, Evelyn's strength is insane!]
[Even an Oscar-winning actor struggles—how did she make it look so easy?]
[What is this woman made of?!]

The live stream erupted.

At the Lowell mansion, Victoria Langley clutched her teacup. Watching her daughter's practiced movements, her eyes reddened.

"Evelyn..." Her voice cracked.

Richard Langley silently squeezed his wife's shoulder, his gaze fixed on the screen.

Two large bundles of vines now lay ready.

"That's enough—" Evelyn's pupils suddenly constricted.

"Look out!"

Ethan instinctively rolled aside as a massive python lunged from the undergrowth, its fangs grazing his sleeve.

"Wrong move." Evelyn's eyes turned icy. She struck like lightning.

Her hand clamped onto the serpent's tail. A glance at Ethan sent him retreating with the crew.

Then—

Evelyn swung the python overhead and smashed it into the ground with terrifying force!
###Chapter 339

Evelyn Laurent's slender fingers clamped onto the tail of the two-meter-long python.

The thick serpent, as wide as a man's arm, sliced through the air in a vicious arc.

Her gaze sharp as a blade, arm muscles taut, she swung the dangerous reptile like a toy.

"Thank God I didn't bring Alexander," she thought with relief.

The crew member's jaw nearly hit the ground.

The drone camera shook violently, clearly startled by the terrifying scene.

Ethan Sullivan reacted instantly, pulling the staff member back.

The live chat exploded.

[OMG! Are those biceps for real?]

[Sister Evelyn is a total badass! She's treating that snake like a jump rope.]

[Ethan dodged so fast LOL]

[I could watch this clip a hundred times!]

The hashtag #EvelynLaurentPythonToss rocketed up the trending charts.

The footage captured every detail:

Ethan executed a flawless roll to evade the attack.

Evelyn struck like lightning, seizing the snake's tail with precision.

The python traced a perfect parabola before landing limp in the distant grass.

"Done." Evelyn dusted her hands as if swatting a mosquito.

She turned to forage for medicinal herbs.

Her delicate fingers parted the dense foliage, quickly gathering what she needed.

"Better prepare extra snake repellent sachets," she calculated.

The memory of Bianca Fairchild being bullied made her eyes frost over.

Ethan wordlessly bundled two large loads of vines.

They trekked back under the weight of their haul.

The setting sun stretched their shadows long.

The vine bundles resembled moving hills on their backs.

Yet their strides remained steady and strong.
###Chapter 340

Two moving green hills darted swiftly through the jungle under the drone's lens.

Evelyn Laurent and Ethan Sullivan carried bundles of vines taller than themselves, yet their steps were light as a stroll.

"They're back!" Julian Langley spotted them from afar and immediately pulled Xander Quincy forward to meet them.

As the vines were unloaded, Julian winced in concern. "Evelyn, why did you carry something so heavy?"

He turned to glare at Ethan. "Couldn't you have taken more?"

Ethan pressed his lips together, silently looking at Evelyn.

"I insisted," Evelyn said, rolling her shoulders. "I'm stronger than him."

She effortlessly lifted two bundles of vines like they were bags of cotton.

"What the—" Xander's eyes widened. "What did you eat growing up?"

"Whatever was available," Evelyn replied flatly.

The air froze.

Xander scratched his head in regret. "Sorry, I didn't mean—"

Evelyn waved him off, tossing the vines into the air and catching them with ease.

The live chat exploded:
[Holy crap! That arm strength!]
[Female Hulk or what?]
[Sis Evelyn is unbeatable!]

Back at the Langley mansion, Victoria Langley's teacup shattered on the floor.

Richard Langley's jaw hung open.

The five Langley brothers exchanged glances. Sebastian murmured, "Our little sister's strength..."

"Badass!" Dominic pumped his fist excitedly.

In the jungle, Evelyn had already begun weaving the vines with practiced ease.

The defined muscles in her slender arms flexed with explosive power with every movement.

Ethan stood silently nearby, recalling the time she lifted a car barehanded, and wisely kept his mouth shut.

"Don't worry, Julian." Evelyn flashed him a smile. "This weight is nothing to me."

To prove her point, she spun an entire bundle of vines overhead with one hand.

Julian: "..."

Suddenly, he realized the people who crossed his sister were the ones who should be worried.
###Chapter 341

Xander Quincy's abrupt apology caught Evelyn Laurent off guard.

"What?"

She tilted her head slightly, her clear eyes brimming with confusion.

Xander stole a glance at Ethan Sullivan and Julian Langley's expressions before murmuring, "I shouldn't have asked you that earlier."

"Why?" Evelyn looked even more perplexed.

Ethan's mellow voice intervened, "He didn't want to trigger painful memories."

His gaze lingered on Evelyn's profile, heartache rippling in his eyes.

The mere thought of her past suffering twisted his heart like a knife.

But Evelyn simply uttered a soft "Oh."

"Not at all."

Those hardships were long behind her now.

Apart from the darkness under Vincent Lowell's roof and the kidnapping nightmare, most of her life—

Had been spent making others tremble in fear.

Street thugs fled at the sight of her, even offering tributes voluntarily.

She just couldn't be bothered to bully the weak.

The topic was swiftly brushed aside.

Evelyn crouched to sort through vines, joined by Julian and Xander.

Suddenly, Julian yelped and leaped back. "Bugs!"

The vine crevices teemed with swarms of insects, a nauseating spectacle.

Evelyn calmly poked at them. "Harmless. Toss them aside—they make good fish bait."

After brief instructions on vine processing, she turned to grind medicinal herbs.

The insect-repellent sachets needed urgent completion. Fewer pests meant smoother travels deeper into the island.

At least the snakes and critters would steer clear.

Meanwhile, Beatrice Quincy's team still struggled with basic survival.

Bianca Fairchild could only manage light chores due to her condition.

The pampered Quincy heiress nearly started a wildfire just trying to light a fire.

"Sorry..." She stood red-eyed, fingers twisting her hem.

Liam and Lucas Croix frantically stamped out the flames before reassuring her, "It's fine, Beatrice."

The brothers exchanged exasperated looks.

This Oscar-winning actress demanded both screen time and her delicate persona, leaving the grueling work to them.

Yet they had to keep smiling—she was, after all, the Quincy heiress and A-list celebrity.

Their mission progress suffered severely as a result.
###Chapter 342

Liam's gaze swept over Evelyn's group, noting the abundance of vines they'd gathered.

He turned to the Quincy sisters. "Beatrice, why don't you two collect some dry grass or vines for bedding?"

After a pause, he added, "My brother and I will go fishing."

Beatrice nodded obediently. "Of course."

She turned to Bianca. "Let's go, Bianca."

It wasn't a suggestion—it was an order.

Bianca's head spun, but she didn't dare argue. Silently, she picked up a rope and followed.

Once they'd walked a distance, Beatrice carelessly hacked at some grass. Spotting denser vegetation ahead, her eyes lit up. "Over there. More grass."

Bianca hesitated, eyeing the untamed area. "Beatrice, there could be snakes. It's not safe—"

Beatrice's expression darkened. "Since when are you so cowardly?"

"If you can't handle a simple task, how will I explain that to Liam?"

"If you're feeling unwell, stay here."

With that, she strode off, a cold glint in her eyes.

How dare this little bitch talk back?

Bianca bit her lip but followed anyway.

She couldn't let anything happen to Beatrice—she'd be the one to suffer for it.

Beatrice fumbled with her combat knife, clumsily cutting grass.

After gathering just a small bundle, her arms already ached.

Bianca worked slower but persisted.

"Take a break if you're tired," Beatrice said with false concern.

Bianca forced herself to speed up. "I'm fine."

[Why is Bianca putting on an act? Trying to slack off again?]

[Disgusting. Get her off the show already!]

[Poor Beatrice, stuck with such deadweight!]

The live stream flooded with vitriol.

Bianca carefully selected plants while Beatrice hacked haphazardly.

When they returned to camp with their bundles, Beatrice suddenly shrieked, dropping her load.

"Ah! My back—it burns!"

Tears welled as searing pain shot through her.
###Chapter 343

Agony crashed over Beatrice Quincy like tidal waves. A million fire ants seemed to be gnawing at her back.

"Ah—"

A bloodcurdling scream tore from her throat as she curled into a fetal position.

The excruciating itch drove her nearly mad. Her hands twitched uncontrollably, desperate to claw at her skin.

"Don't move!"

Bianca Fairchild seized her wrists with surprising strength.

Her pupils contracted sharply when she glimpsed Beatrice's back—an ominous rash was spreading visibly across the skin.

"Those plants," she said tightly. "Liam, call the medics now!"

The Croix brothers paled, fumbling for their walkie-talkies.

"Let me go!" Beatrice thrashed violently, tears and snot smearing her face. "You did this on purpose, didn't you? Why only me—"

SMACK!

The sharp slap silenced her mid-sentence.

Bianca's palm stung, but her voice was glacial. "Keep struggling and you'll never wear backless dresses again."

The blow stunned Beatrice into silence.

She gaped at this unfamiliar version of her sister, suddenly realizing she'd almost shattered her carefully crafted image on camera.

"I...it hurts so much..." Instantly switching tactics, she summoned tears on command, adopting a pitiful whimper.

The live chat exploded:

[Holy shit Bianca's a badass!]

[That reaction time! Beatrice would've shredded her back without her.]

[Fake much? Clearly Bianca poisoned her!]

[Open your eyes! Even Bianca's got scratches on her hand.]

Beads of sweat dotted Bianca's temples as she restrained her writhing sister.

Her gaze darkened when she noticed faint red marks emerging on her own hand.

Those plants...were definitely toxic.
###Chapter 344

"Ahhh—"

Beatrice Quincy's piercing scream tore through the jungle.

The danmu exploded instantly.

[WTF! What's Bianca doing? She's grabbing Beatrice's hand!]

[Oh my God! Beatrice's back is covered in rashes! That bitch Bianca!]

[Is the production crew dead? Save her now!]

Liam and Lucas Croix looked up sharply from gathering wild berries.

"That's Beatrice!"

They exchanged glances and immediately dropped their baskets, sprinting toward the sound.

Timothy Gold and Eugene York collided with the medical team head-on.

"Hurry! Beatrice is in trouble!"

Medics charged forward with a stretcher.

Xander Quincy's hands froze mid-knot as he set up the tent.

"Beatrice!"

He abandoned the ropes and bolted toward the screams.

Evelyn Laurent's group was collecting water by the stream.

"What's happening?"

Chu Mingyue's canteen slipped into the water with a splash.

All three took off running without retrieving it.

Deep in the jungle, Beatrice knelt trembling.

Angry red welts covered her back, oozing blood where fabric rubbed against them.

Bianca Fairchild gripped her wrist tightly.

"Don't touch it! You'll spread the infection!"

"Let me go!" Beatrice sobbed, writhing in pain. "It hurts so much, brother!"

Xander burst into the clearing to this horrific scene.

His pupils contracted violently.

"Bianca!"

His enraged roar sent birds scattering from the trees.

Bianca looked up calmly. "She touched poison ivy."

Evelyn arrived panting, her eyes scanning the vegetation.

Suddenly she crouched, using a stick to part a tangle of vines.

"Giant hogweed!"

The plant's toxic hairs glinted ominously in the sunlight.

"Contact causes severe dermatitis. We need to treat this immediately!"

The medical team finally arrived.

"Clear the area!"

They swiftly erected an isolation tent.

Beatrice whimpered as they helped her inside. "Brother...will I be scarred?"

The moment the tent zipper closed, Xander punched a tree.

"Why didn't anyone warn us about this hazard?"

He glared daggers at Bianca.

The danmu went wild again.

[Did Bianca do this on purpose?]

[If she hadn't stopped her, Beatrice would've scratched her skin raw!]

[The producers owe us an explanation!]

Crystal Rothschild's group arrived just as agonized screams tore from the tent.

"Please...gentler..."

Beatrice's cries cut through everyone like knives.

A medic emerged grim-faced. "She needs emergency evacuation."

Timothy immediately pulled out a satellite phone.

Xander barged inside to find his sister prone on the stretcher, her back a horrifying landscape of weeping sores.

"Beatrice..."

His voice shook.

She lifted tear-filled eyes. "I'm so scared..."

Outside, Bianca stood motionless.

A giant hogweed leaf crumpled in her fist, her expression unreadable.

Evelyn approached. "You knew about this?"

Bianca opened her hand, letting the leaf flutter to the ground.

"I do now."
###Chapter 345

Xander Quincy gently patted Beatrice Quincy's back until her sobs gradually subsided.

Bianca Fairchild stood in the corner, her gaze shifting between them. She pressed her lips together, fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her shirt.

Evelyn Laurent approached silently and suddenly grasped Bianca's wrist.

"Don't move." Evelyn's tone brooked no argument.

She rolled up Bianca's sleeve, revealing reddened skin and several bleeding scratches.

"Ointment." Evelyn extended a hand toward Timothy Gold.

The salve was quickly passed to Ethan Sullivan. Evelyn's movements were gentle as she dabbed the medicine onto the wounds with her fingertips.

"Why didn't you say anything?" She locked eyes with Bianca. "These could scar."

Bianca flinched and withdrew her arm, her voice barely audible. "I... I'm fine."

She kept her head down as if trying to disappear into the floor—a stark contrast to her earlier composed demeanor.

Evelyn frowned, catching Xander's hesitant expression from the corner of her eye.

Beatrice clung to Xander, tearfully glancing at Julian Langley, who remained focused on Evelyn.

The production crew was in chaos.

Timothy wiped sweat from his brow and suggested, "Should we... switch Xander and Bianca's groups?"

Beatrice clearly wasn't in any state to continue filming, and Xander was her only anchor.

As for moving Beatrice to Julian's team? Timothy inwardly shook his head. Everyone knew Julian had been avoiding the young socialite.
###Chapter 346

Beads of sweat formed on Director Timothy Gold's forehead. His fingers tapped nervously against his knee as he stared at Beatrice Quincy's pale face on the monitor. If Beatrice continued filming with Julian Langley's team, this show might end prematurely.

Beatrice's eyelashes fluttered as she prepared to refuse. But Xander Quincy spoke first. "Fine."

"Let Beatrice rest. I'll switch teams."

His gaze remained fixed on Beatrice. The faint red rash visible on her back made his heart clench. His pampered younger sister looked so fragile, as if she might shatter at the slightest touch.

Evelyn Laurent suddenly chuckled, tapping Xander's reddened arm. "Xander, your real sister is injured too."

Bianca Fairchild's head jerked up, pupils dilating in panic. She shook her head frantically at Evelyn, nails digging into her palms. Mentioning her now would only worsen the situation.

Xander stiffened, his eyes shifting to Bianca's inflamed arm. The angry redness made him instinctively rise—until a pained whimper stopped him mid-step.

"Brother...it hurts..." Beatrice curled into herself, tears clinging to her lashes.

Xander immediately turned back, supporting her gently. "Where does it hurt? Should I call a doctor?"

Evelyn watched the scene coldly before yanking Bianca's wrist. "Let's go. We've seen enough."

Beatrice glared at Evelyn's retreating back, teeth grinding. That meddlesome woman kept ruining her plans.

Julian Langley and Ethan Sullivan followed Evelyn without sparing Beatrice a glance. Only the sound of Timothy wiping sweat remained. "Everyone, please be careful! Stop filming immediately if you feel unwell!"

He touched his neck in relief. Thank God it was just an allergy. A real accident would have ended his career on this godforsaken island.

Live stream comments exploded:

[That was terrifying! Thought something serious happened]

[Xander treats his sisters so differently!]

[Bianca deserves it! She must've caused Beatrice's allergy]

[Pretty sure Beatrice faked it. Xander was about to check on Bianca]

[Are you blind? Beatrice was clearly suffering]

In the Quincy mansion, a crystal glass shattered against the TV screen.

"That worthless bastard!" Mrs. Quincy's nails dug into the sofa. "She can't even take care of Beatrice properly!"

Mr. Quincy narrowed his eyes like a predator. "Seems our last lesson wasn't enough." He pulled out his phone. "Tell the hospital to increase the dosage."

On screen, Bianca trailed behind Evelyn with her head down. No one saw the fleeting smirk on her lips.
###Chapter 347

Evelyn Laurent gripped Bianca Fairchild's wrist and pulled her back.

Bianca's arm was taut as a bowstring at first, but gradually relaxed as they walked further.

Ethan Sullivan and Julian Langley followed in silence.

Back at camp, Evelyn swiftly set up the tent. Julian moved to help, but Ethan was already reaching for the poles.

"Mic off," Evelyn said curtly, switching off both her and Bianca's lavalier mics.

She shot Ethan a meaningful look before dragging Bianca inside the tent.

Ethan positioned himself at the entrance. When a cameraman approached, his voice turned icy. "The ladies need privacy."

The crew member backed away immediately.

Julian finally caught on, raking a hand through his hair in frustration. He hadn't grasped his sister's cue fast enough.

"Julian." Ethan picked up the vines. "Let's get back to work."

They moved a short distance away to sort the vines. Ethan's slender fingers worked deftly through the strands while Julian, though less skilled, quickly matched his rhythm.

The sun had warmed the vines, sending tiny insects scuttling from the crevices. No one wanted to wake up bitten in the middle of the night.

Inside the tent, Evelyn sat cross-legged.

Bianca twisted her fingers anxiously.

"What does the Quincy family have on you?" Evelyn cut straight to the point.

Bianca's head jerked up, lips trembling. After a long pause, her voice came out hoarse. "My grandmother..."

Tears splashed onto the back of her hands.

Since childhood, she'd been trapped as Beatrice Quincy's plaything. Her grandmother's medical bills were a noose around her neck, choking her breath away.

The slightest displeasure from Beatrice meant her grandmother's treatment would be cut off.
###Chapter 348

Bianca's fingers twisted the hem of her dress unconsciously, her knuckles turning white.

She kept her head down, her voice barely audible. "The Quincy family... was never my home."

Evelyn's eyelashes fluttered slightly.

Bianca's shoulders trembled. "Ever since I can remember, I knew I was just Beatrice's shadow. I couldn't fight back when she hit or insulted me."

Sunlight slanted through the window, casting pale light across her ashen face.

Evelyn noticed a faint scar on her wrist.

"What's this—"

Bianca instinctively pulled her hand back. "Beatrice cut me with a fruit knife last year. She said it would bring her good luck."

Evelyn's pupils contracted sharply.

She suddenly remembered how Bianca always wore long sleeves when they first met.

"What about your grandmother?" Evelyn asked softly.

Tears spilled from Bianca's eyes without warning. "They locked her away in a private nursing home..."

Her voice cracked. "She was the only one who ever cared about me."

Evelyn seized her hand. "Give me the address."

Bianca looked up abruptly, a flicker of hope in her eyes.

"After the show ends," Evelyn said quietly but firmly, "my parents will help you."

Bianca's tears fell in heavy drops.

She bit her lip hard to stifle her sobs.

"Why... help me?"

Evelyn gazed out the window. "Because I was once..."

She didn't finish, but Bianca understood.

The two girls sat in silence under the sunlight.

"Xander..." Evelyn suddenly spoke.

Bianca visibly stiffened.

"He's different," she murmured. "He knows I'm not his real sister, but..."

Her eyes glazed over momentarily.

The boy who once handed her candy now avoided her like the plague.

"He showed you kindness," Evelyn said pointedly.

Bianca smiled bitterly. "That's what makes it worse."

She wiped her face. "None of that matters now."

Evelyn studied her thoughtfully. "Not necessarily."

Bianca looked up in confusion.

"Some things," Evelyn said meaningfully, "aren't always what they seem."

She stood and extended her hand. "Let's deal with the immediate problem first."

Bianca hesitated before finally taking her hand.

Sunlight illuminated their clasped fingers.

At that moment, the gears of fate began to turn.
###Chapter 349

Bianca Fairchild thought this love would remain buried in the darkest corner of her heart forever.

But Beatrice Quincy saw right through her.

That afternoon, Beatrice stormed into her room and hurled her diary onto the floor. Pink pages scattered everywhere, each one filled with Xander Quincy's name.

"Slut!" Beatrice's palm struck her cheek with a sharp crack. "How dare you lust after my brother?"

The Quincy parents rushed in at the commotion. Their eyes turned icy when they saw the diary pages, as if gazing at something vile.

"After all we've done for you, this is how you repay us?" Mrs. Quincy's voice cut like glass.

The physical pain paled in comparison to Xander standing there, watching coldly.

His gaze made her feel like a filthy rodent.

"Don't let me see you again." Those were his last words to her.

From that day on, Xander became a regular at nightclubs. Tabloids overflowed with photos of him entangled with different women. Each time they crossed paths, he'd glare at her with undisguised revulsion.

Once, she gathered the courage to approach him. He humiliated her publicly: "Get lost. You make me sick."

Bianca's hope died completely.

Until that rainy night.

She found a drunken Xander outside a convenience store. Alcohol clung to him, but his eyes burned unnaturally bright.

"Bianca..." His grip on her wrist was painfully tight.

That night, Xander transformed. He whispered her name with tenderness, as if she were something precious.

By dawn, he dressed without a backward glance, leaving no trace of their intimacy.

Bianca clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms.

"Xander and I... we're nothing." Her voice cracked on the lie.

How could they be?

She was the Quincy family's charity case—Beatrice's human luck charm. Their parents made it clear: trash like her wasn't fit to lick Xander's shoes.

And technically, they were siblings.

Evelyn Laurent gently embraced her trembling shoulders.

"They're the unworthy ones." Evelyn's quiet words pierced Bianca's darkness like sunlight.

Suddenly, Bianca laughed.

Tears still streaked her face, but her smile was genuine.

"You're right." She wiped her cheeks. "Let's go."

Years of practice had taught her to lock her true self behind masks. Yet for the first time, she felt light.

Evelyn didn't know it, but that hug marked Bianca's rebirth.
###Chapter 350

The moment the microphone turned back on, Bianca Fairchild straightened her spine.

A faint smile played on her lips, her eyes sparkling like stars.

Ethan Sullivan's vines paused mid-motion.

He studied Bianca with subtle surprise flickering in his gaze.

That bastard Xander Quincy was finally getting what he deserved.

Served him right.

The four of them worked in perfect sync, quickly organizing the vines.

Emerald tendrils carpeted the ground like a vibrant forest.

"We need more," Evelyn Laurent glanced around. "I'll go cut some."

"I'll come with you," Ethan immediately offered.

Bianca spoke at the same time. "Me too."

Evelyn smiled warmly. "Ethan can go with me. Bianca, help my third brother dry the vines."

Her tone was gentle as spring water.

A stark contrast to the icy demeanor she showed Beatrice Quincy.

"Okay!" Bianca beamed.

[OMG! Did Bianca just transform into a different person?]

[What did Evelyn say to her? She's glowing now!]

[She's so beautiful when she smiles. Why was she always hiding before?]

[She used to be such a doormat around Beatrice. This is a complete 180!]

The danmu exploded with comments.

Viewers' perceptions of Bianca were shifting in real time.

In the studio, Victoria Langley gently squeezed her husband's hand.

"Evelyn's friend needs our help."

Richard Langley's gaze darkened. "We're already investigating what the Quincys have on her."

"With the live stream still running, the Quincys must be panicking."

Victoria's heart ached as she watched the screen. "Such a sweet girl, ruined by that family."

"And that spoiled Beatrice—completely lawless."

Both were pampered heiresses, yet their Evelyn would never bully others.

Richard patted his wife's hand reassuringly. "Don't worry. We'll get justice for her."

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Ethan arrived at their usual gathering spot.

Only to find Rachel Clemenson's team already there.

Leo Clemenson and Hugo Rothschild were cutting vines.

Crystal Rothschild looked pale as she sorted them, fingers trembling slightly.

Rachel worked through her nausea, processing vines at record speed.

She had to outperform Crystal.

This was her last chance.
###Chapter 351

Evelyn Laurent's gaze swept indifferently over the group.

Her lips pressed into a thin line as she strode toward the overgrown vines.

Ethan Sullivan followed closely behind.

The two began harvesting the vines with seamless coordination.

Hugo Rothschild worked alone on the opposite side.

His movements were swift but noticeably slower than Evelyn's rhythm.

Evelyn's wrist flicked with precision.

The combat knife traced silver arcs through the sunlight.

Vines snapped like fragile threads beneath her skilled hands.

Ethan gracefully gathered the cut vines with fluid motions.

Their teamwork resembled a meticulously choreographed dance.

Hugo's pupils constricted sharply.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn's nimble fingers.

His Adam's apple bobbed involuntarily.

This woman... was an absolute monster.

His jaw clenched as he tightened his grip.

The vines groaned before snapping under excessive force.

Leo Clemenson paused, panting heavily.

His eyes darted between the two groups.

"Making a woman do such rough work..." he muttered under his breath.

Two razor-sharp gazes instantly pinned him in place.

Leo froze as cold sweat drenched his back.

Those piercing stares seemed to see through his very soul.

Evelyn suddenly tossed her combat knife toward Ethan.

"Catch."

The blade flashed cold steel through the air.

"Watch out!"

Crystal Rothschild and Rachel Clemenson screamed simultaneously.

Ethan's slender fingers caught the hilt with effortless precision.

"Tired?" he asked softly.

Evelyn gave a casual nod before sitting beneath a tree's shade.

Crystal's face paled.

"Do you realize how dangerous that was?"

Rachel frowned in agreement.

"What if Mr. Sullivan got hurt?"

Evelyn lifted icy eyes.

"You think I'd miss?"

Her voice dripped with frost.

Crystal stumbled half a step backward.

Rachel opened her mouth but ultimately closed it in sullen silence.
###Chapter 352

Evelyn Laurent twirled the combat knife between her fingers. The blade glinted coldly in the sunlight.

She knew Ethan Sullivan too well.

For him, catching a knife thrown with this precision was as easy as catching a falling leaf.

The knife cut through the air in a straight silver line, its trajectory calculated to perfection.

But Rachel Clemenson and Crystal Rothschild screamed as if they'd seen a ghost.

"Evelyn Laurent! Have you lost your mind?" Rachel covered her mouth, her eyes wide with shock.

Evelyn smirked.

Did these people really think so highly of themselves?

Leo Clemenson immediately jumped in to accuse her. "You're playing with people's lives!"

"None of your business." Evelyn's gaze turned icy. "Who do you think you are?"

Leo's face paled instantly.

He clenched his fists, his voice trembling. "What if you hit Mr. Sullivan? Could you bear that responsibility?"

Ethan chuckled softly.

He effortlessly tossed the knife back to Evelyn with fluid grace.

"Mr. Clemenson," Ethan said coolly, "Evelyn and I handle our own affairs. Outsiders need not interfere."

Leo was instantly silenced.

He glared at Evelyn with venomous hatred burning in his eyes.

How dare this bitch?

Was it just because she had Ethan's backing?

Evelyn caught his malicious stare instantly.

"Keep looking," she slowly raised the knife, pointing the tip directly at Leo, "and I'll make sure you never see daylight again."

The live stream exploded.

[How arrogant! Threatening someone in public?]

[She threw the knife first and still acts righteous?]

[Leo's glare was disgusting. I'd snap too.]

[Mr. Sullivan said it's just how they interact. Mind your own business.]

[Rachel and her brother are clearly targeting Evelyn. Think we're blind?]

Evelyn sheathed the knife and turned toward the depths of the jungle.

She had no patience for these clowns.

Ethan quickly followed, their figures gradually disappearing from the camera's view.

Rachel bit her lip hard.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

This Evelyn Laurent was far more formidable than she'd anticipated.
###Chapter 353

Leo Clemenson froze in place, his blood turning to ice.

Evelyn Laurent's gaze was like a poisoned dagger, piercing straight into his soul.

"Evelyn!" Rachel Clemenson yanked her brother behind her, her voice shrill with panic. "Have you lost your mind? We live in a society governed by law!"

Her chest heaved violently, nails digging into her palms.

Crystal Rothschild bit her lower lip, her voice soft and hesitant. "Evelyn, that kind of talk is really inappropriate..." Her lashes fluttered. "Leo was just worried about you."

Evelyn scoffed and turned to leave.

"Stop." Ethan Sullivan's voice cut through the air.

He stepped slowly toward Rachel, his presence suffocating. "Who gave you the right to dictate terms to my woman?"

The combat knife glinted coldly in the sunlight.

"If I hear one more word—" Ethan's lips curled into a smile, but his eyes remained frozen. "I won't hesitate to silence you myself."

Rachel paled, stumbling back half a step.

The next moment, Ethan turned and took Evelyn's hand, his voice instantly softening. "Come on, let's get back to work."

Hugo Rothschild remained silent in the shadows.

His knuckles whitened around his knife, his gaze locked onto Evelyn.

Both men swung their blades at the vines.

The clash of steel carried an unspoken tension, thick as gunpowder in the air.

"Snake." Evelyn paused abruptly, not bothering to turn.

Crystal shrieked and jumped back.

"Don't worry!" Rachel forced a steady tone. "I used to catch snakes back home—"

Her voice trailed off as she met Hugo's icy glare.

Crystal clutched Rachel's sleeve. "C-can we just go back?"

No one answered.

Only the rhythmic sound of blades slicing through vines echoed through the jungle. Hugo's strikes grew faster, yet he couldn't close the distance between himself and that unwavering figure ahead.
###Chapter 354

Hugo Rothschild was utterly outmatched in front of Ethan Sullivan.

What he considered a rivalry wasn't even acknowledged with a glance.

Crystal Rothschild paled. Rachel and Leo Clemenson exchanged reluctant nods.

The four gathered their vines and returned to camp.

Evelyn Laurent's team had become the gold standard for the other groups.

Whenever they felt lost, observing Evelyn's team provided answers.

Like weaving mats from vines.

Beatrice Quincy, meanwhile, became a cautionary tale.

Her painful mishap taught everyone which plants to avoid.

Injured and immobilized, Beatrice forced Xander Quincy to gather vines with the Croix brothers.

Despite setbacks, all three teams finally found their rhythm.

Timothy Gold breathed a sigh of relief.

Only after medics confirmed Beatrice's rash was temporary would she stop complaining.

But Bianca Fairchild seized the chance to join Evelyn's team.

The thought made Beatrice grind her teeth.

Though she got Xander in exchange, she coveted Evelyn's group.

Julian Langley was there.

He was the sole reason she'd joined this mediocre show.

The cast was full of nobodies—even civilians.

This program was merely her stepping stone to Julian.

Beatrice touched her back.

The bumpy texture made her shudder. She couldn't bear to look.

"Bianca Fairchild!"

She spat the name like poison, eyes burning with malice.

Now she was certain—that little bitch had sabotaged her deliberately.

No cameras. No mics. Just the privacy of her tent.

Beatrice stormed out, heading straight for production.

Timothy's face fell at her approach.

What fresh hell did this diva want now?

Before he could react, she barged in.

"Assistant director! Give me my phone back!"

Confirming no cameras were rolling, Beatrice thrust out her hand imperiously.
###Chapter 355

Timothy Gold's face darkened as his fingers drummed absently on the desk.

"The rules are clear, Miss Quincy." He lifted his gaze to meet Beatrice Quincy's. "No phone usage during filming."

Beatrice slammed her palms on the table, her manicured nails screeching across the surface.

"My leg is injured like this, and you won't even let me make a call?" Her voice turned shrill. "Think carefully about the consequences, Timothy."

Timothy remained unmoved, his eyes glacial.

"Rules are rules."

Beatrice's chest heaved with barely contained fury. She hadn't expected this minor director to dare stand up to her.

"You think having Vincent Lowell's backing makes you untouchable?" She sneered. "I could ruin your career in this industry with one word."

Eugene York arrived just in time to hear the threat.

"Director Gold..." He hesitated.

Timothy waved him off.

"Miss Quincy is free to quit anytime." His tone remained even. "The yacht stands ready around the clock."

A flicker of hesitation crossed Beatrice's eyes. Leaving meant forfeiting exposure from this hit reality show.

"Fine. Very well!" She ground her teeth. "We'll see about this!"

Her stilettos struck the floor like gunshots as she stormed away.

Eugene watched her retreating figure with concern.

"Director Gold, the Quincy family has considerable influence..."

Timothy lit a cigarette and took a deep drag.

"I'm more concerned about Mr. Sullivan and Vincent Lowell's stance." His expression blurred behind the smoke. "Every arrangement on this island was personally approved by Mr. Sullivan."

Only then did Eugene notice the Sullivan Group logo on the distant yacht.

"The medical team consists of top specialists from Sullivan Hospital. The security system is provided by Lowell Technologies." Timothy tapped his cigarette. "Do you really think the Quincys can reach here?"

The sea breeze carried a briny tang.

Understanding dawned on Eugene, his tense shoulders relaxing.

"So Beatrice's injury..."

"Superficial." Timothy stubbed out his cigarette. "The doctor confirmed it won't even leave a scar."

The distant sound of shattering objects made them exchange knowing smiles.

On this isolated island, even the Quincy heiress had to play by the rules.
###Chapter 356

Timothy Gold leaned lazily against the tent with an indifferent smile. "Julian Langley is my brother. You think he'd let anything happen to me?"

His confidence was well-founded.

When Julian first entered the entertainment industry, it was Timothy who recognized his potential. He single-handedly propelled the inexperienced young man onto variety show stages. From obscurity to Oscar-winning actor, every step bore Timothy's influence.

That bond wasn't something Julian would forget.

Later, when Timothy learned Julian was actually the third son of the Langley family, he merely raised an eyebrow. Their friendship had never required status to sustain it.

Did Beatrice Quincy really think she could stir up trouble on this show? She was sorely mistaken.

Outside the tent, Beatrice took a deep breath, forcibly suppressing her fury. Adjusting her expression for the cameras, she turned toward Evelyn Laurent's campsite.

By the shore, the four of them were busy processing freshly gathered vines.

Evelyn suddenly stood up, her fingers weaving swiftly as an intricate basket took shape. She weighted the bottom with stones and gently placed it in the shallows.

"What's this?" Julian asked curiously, moving closer.

"A fish trap." Without looking up, Evelyn began boiling seawater in a cast-iron pot.

Bianca Fairchild's eyes sparkled like stars. "Sister Evelyn, you're amazing!" She trailed after Evelyn like an eager puppy, admiration written all over her face.

Julian and Ethan Sullivan exchanged a glance, their expressions darkening simultaneously.

The vine in Ethan's hands snapped with a sharp crack. His jaw clenched as he watched Bianca cling to Evelyn's side.

If he'd known this would happen, he never would have agreed to switch groups.
###Chapter 357

Beatrice Quincy dragged her weakened steps toward Evelyn Laurent's campsite, just in time to see Julian Langley and Ethan Sullivan organizing vines with grim expressions. Evelyn was boiling water over a fire while Bianca Fairchild crouched nearby, feeding branches into the flames.

"Mr. Langley, what are you working on?"

Beatrice's voice was as faint as a mosquito's hum.

She moved slowly, her face pale as parchment, yet her eyes sparkled with curiosity.

Julian didn't bother looking up. "Can't you see for yourself?"

He kept working without granting her a single glance.

Beatrice clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. She forced a smile. "Sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to check on Bianca."

Her gaze shifted to Bianca. "How's your arm injury? Do you need help changing the bandages?"

Bianca's body instantly stiffened.

Hearing Beatrice's voice triggered an involuntary tremble—a lingering effect from years of psychological control.

But feeling Evelyn's steady gaze, Bianca gradually relaxed. "Thanks for your concern. It's fine now."

Beatrice narrowed her eyes. "Seems you're quite happy here."

Her lips curved into a smile, but her eyes held daggers.

Before Bianca could respond, Evelyn suddenly spoke. "Anyone would be happy after escaping hell."

She set down the firewood, her gaze icy.

Beatrice's face darkened. "What do you mean by that, Evelyn?"

"Exactly what I said." Evelyn stood, towering over her. "Shall I tell the live audience what you've done to Bianca?"

Beatrice staggered back, shooting a panicked glance at the cameras. "We're sisters. What could I possibly do to her?"

Her eyes flashed a warning at Bianca.

The live chat exploded:

[OMG major tea!]
[Proof Beatrice bullied her sister!]
[BS! Beatrice is so sweet to Bianca!]
[Did you see Bianca tremble?]

Bianca silently moved behind Evelyn, meeting Beatrice's gaze directly for the first time.

Beatrice shook with rage.

Everything had gone wrong since arriving on this damned island. Now even this worthless girl dared defy her!

"Feeling guilty?" Evelyn advanced step by step.

Beatrice lifted her chin. "Why would I be?"
###Chapter 358

Beatrice Quincy glared at Evelyn Laurent with icy disdain, her voice dripping with authority. "Evelyn Laurent, stop trying to sow discord between us. Bianca and I grew up together. Our bond is unbreakable."

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile, her gaze sharp as a blade. "Beatrice Quincy, do you even believe the nonsense you're spouting?"

"Beatrice!"

Xander Quincy's urgent shout cut through the tension between the two women.

He arrived breathless, sweat glistening on his forehead. Timothy Gold had summoned him in a panic, fearing Beatrice might cause an irreversible scene during the live broadcast.

Xander sensed something amiss between Beatrice and Bianca Fairchild—likely involving those unspeakable secrets of wealthy families.

Though he'd stood his ground against Beatrice earlier, now...

Sometimes retreat was the wiser choice.

Let Beatrice ruin her reputation elsewhere—just not during his show's live stream!

Xander grabbed Beatrice's wrist, his brow furrowed. "I told you to rest in the tent. Why are you out here?"

He knew the truth. Beatrice hadn't come for Bianca.

She'd used Bianca as an excuse to see Julian Langley.

Xander couldn't comprehend Beatrice's obsession with Julian, especially when the man clearly despised her.

Beatrice's eyes welled up instantly, her voice trembling. "Xander, I was just worried about Bianca, but..."

Her words dissolved into dramatic sobs, as if she'd suffered some grave injustice.

Xander's patience wore thin as he forced out a stiff consolation. "Enough, Beatrice. Stop crying."

Evelyn watched the performance with cold amusement. "How convincing."

Beatrice's tears halted momentarily before she wailed even louder.

Xander broke into a nervous sweat, desperately signaling Ethan Sullivan with his eyes.

For heaven's sake!

Make Evelyn shut up already!

Certain things shouldn't be discussed on camera...

His gaze shifted to Bianca, his expression unreadably complex.

But Bianca merely turned away, her indifference cutting deeper than any blade.

Xander stared at her, his chest constricting painfully.

Why...?

Why was she looking at him like a stranger?

A glint of cold fury flashed in Ethan's eyes. Just as Evelyn prepared another verbal strike, he gently tugged her sleeve.

Evelyn frowned and shot him an irritated glare.

Ethan raised his hand with puppy-dog eyes, his voice soft and wounded. "Evelyn... my hand hurts..."
###Chapter 359

Evelyn's gaze sharpened as it landed on Ethan's outstretched hand.

Her pupils contracted slightly.

"Your hand..."

Her fingertips lightly brushed the rash-covered skin. The contact burned.

Ethan withdrew his hand casually. "It's nothing. Probably just an allergic reaction."

His tone was calm, but his eyes shot a warning glare at Xander.

Xander's expression darkened instantly. He grabbed Beatrice's arm. "Enough. We're leaving."

"Brother!" Beatrice struggled against his grip, resentment flashing in her eyes.

Evelyn remained focused on examining Ethan's hand, missing the complicated look Xander gave her before departing.

His gaze lingered on Bianca for a brief moment before he turned away.

Inside the tent, Beatrice slammed the flap shut and ripped off her microphone.

"How dare they treat me like this!" Her voice trembled with rage, eyes red-rimmed.

She had always been the Quincy family's treasured jewel. Every whim catered to, every desire fulfilled.

Yet now, even the most obedient Bianca dared defy her.

"Enough." Xander's voice cut through her tantrum. "Stop provoking Evelyn."

"Me? Provoke her?" Beatrice's voice rose shrilly. "She's the one targeting me at every turn!"

Xander clamped a hand over her mouth. "Have you lost your mind?"

He hissed under his breath, "The Laurents back Evelyn. If this escalates, do you think the Quincy family's skeletons can withstand scrutiny?"

Beatrice paled.

"You think your dirty laundry is still secret?" Xander sneered. "That car accident last year alone—"

"Shut up!" Beatrice shoved him away violently. "That was an accident!"

Xander studied his sister with conflicted eyes.

Some truths, once exposed, could never be taken back.
###Chapter 360

Bianca Fairchild's origin was the Quincy family's most shameful secret.

She was never a true Quincy by blood.

The family had adopted her solely as a luck shield for Beatrice Quincy.

In the Quincy household, she wasn't even treated as human.

Xander Quincy had once fought for her.

That battle ended in devastating defeat.

His efforts only made Bianca avoid him like the plague.

"I can overlook Evelyn Laurent's interference," Beatrice bit her lip, eyes glinting with frost, "But how dare that Bianca waltz around like she owns the place? She's just a disposable luck charm!"

"Beatrice!"

Xander's voice cracked like a whip.

His knuckles whitened, jaw clenched tight. "Is this how the Quincys raised you? To spew such filth?"

Beatrice froze.

Her brother had never used that tone with her before.

What shocked her more was his fury being directed at Bianca's defense.

"Have you lost your mind?" Her voice turned shrill. "Don't tell me you're still obsessed with that trash! What spell did she cast on you?"

Xander silently thanked his foresight in dismissing the staff.

These words could ruin the Quincy name if overheard.

"Enough, Beatrice."

Exhaustion lined his features. "I warned you Julian Langley isn't interested. Why keep throwing yourself at the Langley family?"

"Only Julian deserves me!" She jutted her chin. "We're both Oscar winners. A perfect match!"

Her lips curled into a sneer. "Unlike some with trashy taste, pining after a worthless stand-in."

"Did our parents' lessons mean nothing?" Her whisper carried venom. "Imagine the scandal if they knew you still—"

"Beatrice!"

Xander's chest heaved, nails biting into his palms.

The sister he'd coddled since childhood now gazed at him with such contempt.

"Mother and Father were clear," she sang sweetly. "Anyone but that trash. Unless you want the Quincys to become a laughingstock?"

Each syllable pierced like an icicle.

He stood paralyzed, blood turning to sludge.

Suddenly Beatrice beamed, looping her arm through his. "But don't worry, dear brother. I'm your favorite, aren't I?"

Her sugary tone dripped poison. "You'd never truly fall for such filth... right?"
###Chapter 361

Beatrice's smile was particularly jarring.

Her radiant face bloomed with dazzling amusement, the corners of her eyes lifting like a rose in full bloom.

Yet Xander Quincy only felt a chill crawl down his spine.

Staring at his sister's flawless makeup, he momentarily saw the flickering tongue of a venomous serpent.

"Brother." Beatrice patted his shoulder lightly, the crushed diamonds on her nails glinting under the light. "You've never measured up to our eldest brother."

Her voice dripped with honeyed sweetness.

"Mom and Dad gave up on you long ago."

Xander's knuckles whitened from how tightly he clenched his fists.

The air inside the tent seemed to freeze solid.

Beatrice toyed with her nails leisurely, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

She knew this brother of hers too well.

Just as expected, Xander's Adam's apple bobbed several times before he spoke hoarsely, "Beatrice, stop provoking Evelyn Laurent."

"Why should I?" She snapped her head up.

"If she exposes all your dirty secrets..." His gaze darkened. "You won't be able to handle the consequences."

Beatrice scoffed.

Of course she knew how formidable Evelyn was.

But Julian Langley—

She would have him, no matter what.

"Fine." She replied dismissively, icy glints flashing in her eyes.

When Xander turned to leave, the temperature in the tent seemed to drop another few degrees.

Meanwhile, the scent of medicinal herbs lingered in Camp 3.

Evelyn focused on grinding herbs in a mortar, strands of hair swaying gently with each movement.

"Does it hurt?" She applied the salve to Ethan Sullivan's hand.

Ethan shook his head, his gaze tender enough to melt.

Julian suddenly squeezed between them, pouting as he extended both hands. "Evie, your third brother's hands hurt too."

He blinked up at her like a large, eager puppy.

Evelyn sighed in resignation.

The aroma of herbs mingled with campfire smoke, drifting lazily into the night.
###Chapter 362

The auction hall glittered under dazzling crystal chandeliers. Raina Qi's palm grew clammy around her bidding paddle.

"One hundred fifty million, first call!"

The auctioneer's voice echoed through the venue. Her gaze locked onto Viola Shi's direction, but the other woman didn't even glance her way.

"Mr. Chen..." Her voice trembled. "I never expected this..."

Chen shoved her hand away, fury blazing in his eyes. "Idiot! You've been played!"

Raina's face turned ashen. Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

"One hundred fifty million, second call!"

Whispers from surrounding guests pierced like daggers.

"Mrs. Nie certainly spends lavishly..."
"Rumor says the Chen Group's cash flow is tight..."
"This will be entertaining..."

Her head snapped up, meeting Viola's mocking half-smile.

"Vi," Yvonne Su tugged Viola's sleeve. "The Chen Group may not rival the Shis, but—"

Viola toyed with her champagne flute, crimson lips curling. "What's there to fear?" Her voice dripped indifference. "Let's see if Nicholas Nie cleans up her mess."

"One hundred fifty million, third call! Sold!"

The gavel's crack made Raina flinch.

Chen rose with a thunderous expression. "Fix this yourself." He strode out without looking back.

In the restroom mirror, Raina stared at her ghostly reflection. With shaking fingers, she dialed.

"Nicholas, I—"

"Have you lost your mind?!" His roar made her eardrums throb. "Get back here now!"

The call ended. She studied her flawless makeup in the mirror—then smashed her fist through the glass.

Shards sliced her fingertips. Blood dripped onto the marble countertop, each crimson drop mirroring her shattered dignity.
###Chapter 363

"Alright." Evelyn Laurent agreed briskly.

Bianca Fairchild always tempered her sharp edges around Beatrice Quincy, but her black belt in taekwondo was nothing to underestimate. Last time Beatrice caught her off guard was pure luck.

Ethan Sullivan's expression darkened instantly.

He never expected to guard against Julian Langley, only for Bianca to swoop in.

"Third brother, you and Ethan handle the vines." Evelyn tilted her chin at Julian. "Gather some branches later."

Julian grinned ear to ear.

For the first time, he found Bianca rather pleasing. He nodded eagerly. "Don't worry, I'll get it done."

The glee in his tone was unmistakable.

That Ethan kept finding excuses to hover around Evelyn had long grated on him.

First he broke off their engagement, now he wouldn't stop pestering her.

Trying to win his sister back?

Over his dead body.

Ethan saw right through Julian's thoughts.

Watching Evelyn's retreating figure, he suddenly called out, "Evelyn."

She paused and glanced back.

Ethan caught up in quick strides, his gaze intense. "I'm coming with you."

"Your hand—"

"It's fine now." He held it out. "I'm worried about you."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Nothing on this island can touch me."

Her tone carried careless arrogance.

But Ethan stubbornly grasped her hand. "Let me stay with you."

The warmth of his palm sent a tremor through her.

She met his unwavering stare, those eyes brimming with concern.

Behind them, Julian ground his teeth in frustration.

Ethan shot Bianca a warning glance, his eyes dark with unspoken threat.
###Chapter 364

Bianca's gaze flickered between the two of them before she lowered her lashes and took half a step back.

"My head still hurts," she murmured, fingers absently brushing the bandage at her temple. "You two go ahead."

Ethan immediately seized the opportunity. "I'll stay with you." His voice betrayed barely contained eagerness.

Evelyn finally remembered Bianca's injury. She bit her lip in regret. "Rest well, then."

The corners of Ethan's eyes crinkled with barely suppressed joy. He casually positioned himself beside Evelyn, close enough to catch the scent of sea breeze in her hair.

[OMG Ethan's gaze is lethal!]
[He literally glows when looking at Evelyn!]
[Bianca is such an angel TT]

The live chat exploded. Everyone could see the unmistakable adoration shining in Ethan's eyes.

Evelyn was busy scanning their surroundings. She kicked aside a loose pebble, frowning slightly. "Hope we find some game."

"Tired of fish?" Ethan chuckled.

"Had it every day in the village." Her pout made her look like a petulant child.

Suddenly, sharp cries pierced the sky. A flock of seagulls circled above the waves.

Evelyn's eyes lit up. She swiftly bent to gather a handful of smooth stones, testing their weight in her palm.

Ethan held his breath.

With a flick of her wrist, the stones cut through the air. The startled gulls scattered, the last stone barely grazing a wingtip.

"Missed." She kicked the sand in frustration.

Watching her puffed cheeks, Ethan fought the urge to pinch them. "They'll come back," he soothed.

The sea wind tangled Evelyn's hair as she watched the retreating birds, oblivious to the tender devotion in the man's gaze beside her.
###Chapter 365

Evelyn shook her wrist, brushing off the disappointment of her failed bird hunt.

She crouched low, fingers gently parting the fallen leaves as her sharp eyes scanned for clues.

"Cottontail!" she whispered suddenly, pointing at the tracks and droppings on the ground.

Ethan moved closer and smirked. "Looks like we're having a feast tonight."

They moved silently through the trees like stalking leopards. Evelyn raised her hand in a sudden halt, gaze locking onto a gray blur ahead.

Her combat knife slid free with a practiced flick of her wrist.

Whoosh—

The blade flashed. The rabbit dropped instantly.

"Clean shot." Ethan nodded approvingly, though his brow twitched at the sight of blood.

Evelyn grabbed the rabbit and tossed it at him without looking. "Catch!"

He reflexively caught it but held it at arm's length, keeping his clothes pristine. His exasperated sigh went unnoticed as she was already sprinting after the next prey.

"Evelyn!" He broke into a run. "Slow down!"

Above them, a drone circled, capturing their rapid pursuit through the forest.

The production crew erupted into chaos. Timothy gripped his walkie-talkie. "Evelyn! Stop right now!"

The live chat exploded:

[That speed is insane! Is she an athlete?]
[CEO Ethan chasing after her is so hot!]
[RIP cameraman]

Victoria paled as she watched the tracking screen. "They're heading straight for the restricted zone!"

Evelyn's world narrowed to the fleeing gray target. With a burst of speed, she launched forward and tackled the rabbit mid-leap.
###Chapter 366

The gray rabbit kept thrashing wildly in her grip.

Evelyn Laurent swiftly grabbed its long ears. The creature immediately went limp.

She brushed grass stains off her clothes and stood up, a triumphant smile playing on her lips.

Ethan Sullivan rushed over, his face pale.

"Evelyn!" His voice was tight. "Don't do that again."

"Do what?" She tilted her head, still holding the rabbit.

Ethan seized her wrist.

His gaze locked onto the thin red scratch on her arm, his brows furrowing. "This is what you call unharmed?"

"This barely counts as a scratch." She shook her hand dismissively.

Ethan inhaled sharply.

"Then what would you consider an injury?"

Evelyn pointed at the lifeless rabbit in his hand. "That."

His eyes darkened instantly.

"If you ever got hurt like that," his voice dropped low, "I'd be a dead man."

"Why?" She blinked.

"Your parents. Your three brothers. My father." He enunciated each word. "They'd tear me apart limb by limb."

Not to mention his own heart would shatter.

"Oh." Realization dawned on her. "Relax, my reflexes are razor-sharp."

She turned to leave.

Ethan yanked her back.

"What now?" Evelyn shot him a wary glare.

Without a word, he pulled out a cotton swab and pressed it to her arm.

"Hold still." His voice was soft, his touch even softer.

She tried to pull away but found his grip unyielding.

His head was bent, long lashes casting shadows across his face.

The cotton swab dabbed gently at the wound, cleaning away dirt and blood.

"Evelyn Laurent." He suddenly looked up. "None of us want to see you hurt."

"Bleeding means you're injured," his voice roughened, "and it hurts us."

Evelyn abruptly asked, "What about menstrual cycles then?"

Ethan's hand jerked. The cotton swab fell to the ground.
###Chapter 367

Ethan Sullivan's ears turned crimson instantly. His gaze darted away in flustered panic.

His Adam's apple bobbed. His heart pounded like war drums.

How could this woman say such things without hesitation?

Evelyn Laurent tilted her head with an innocent expression. "Doesn't menstruation count as an injury?"

Ethan drew a sharp breath, his fingertips trembling slightly.

"Yes."

Memories surfaced of a girl fainting from cramps in the ER. A pang of tenderness twisted his chest.

So she endured this too.

Evelyn nodded thoughtfully and continued walking ahead.

An awkward tension lingered in the air.

"This rabbit..." Ethan cleared his throat, grasping for a subject change.

Evelyn crouched and lifted the creature by its scruff, examining it closely.

"It's from the production crew." Her tone was certain. "Wild cottontails aren't this easy to catch."

Ethan froze.

What life had his girl lived to recognize such details at a glance?

"Hold this." Evelyn suddenly shoved the squirming rabbit into his arms.

He fumbled to catch it. The limp body thudded to the ground.

The cottontail thrashed violently—

Its hind legs kicked out in a powerful jerk—

"!"

Warm liquid soaked through his camouflage pants.

Ethan stood rigid, his face turning ashen.

The acrid stench hit his nostrils. He nearly choked on the spot.

"Ethan?" Evelyn called from a short distance away.

Clenching his jaw, he gripped the damp rabbit, statue-still.

A conspicuous wet stain bloomed across his trousers.
###Chapter 368

Ethan Sullivan suddenly stopped walking, his face turning unusually grim.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn Laurent turned to look at him.

"The rabbit..." Ethan hesitated, his brows furrowed.

Evelyn was puzzled. "What about it?"

"It..." He took a deep breath. "Pee'd."

For a moment, Evelyn didn't react. "So what if it pee'd—"

Mid-sentence, realization struck. Her eyes widened as she stared at Ethan. "Don't tell me it got on you?"

Ethan gave a stiff nod, his expression ashen.

Evelyn rushed back and took the misbehaving bunny from him. She grabbed a handful of wild grass. "Here, wipe yourself first."

Ethan took the grass and hastily scrubbed at the damp spot on his trousers. His face was pinched, as if he might cry.

"Just bear with it." Evelyn deftly tied the rabbit with a rope. "Hold it like this. It won't pee on you again."

Ethan took the other end of the rope and finally relaxed.

Seeing the usually elegant and dignified CEO in such a disheveled state, Evelyn couldn't help but laugh.

She remembered the first time she'd met Ethan.

It had been raining that night, his luxury car stuck in the mud. Even then, he'd carried himself like a prince.

And now...

The scent of rabbit urine drifted on the breeze, making Evelyn laugh harder.

"Are you laughing at me, Evie?" Ethan suddenly asked, his voice small and wounded.

He kept his head down, mumbling, "Do you... dislike me now?"

The unexpected pout caught Evelyn off guard.

"No!" she denied quickly—only to meet Ethan's mischievous gaze.

He'd been faking it!

Evelyn stomped her foot in frustration. "Ethan Sullivan!"

"Here." He answered with a smile, his eyes full of affection.

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling them both. Even the smell of rabbit pee didn't seem so bad anymore.
###Chapter 369

Ethan Sullivan's eyes deepened with amusement at Evelyn Laurent's response. His slender fingers gently stroked the rabbit's ears. "I knew you'd be the sweetest."

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows across his sharp profile.

Evelyn suddenly felt her cheeks burn. She spun around and pointed at the bushes. "Something moved over there!"

She darted away like a startled fawn, her retreating figure radiating flustered energy.

Watching her hasty escape, Ethan couldn't help but chuckle. He picked up the rabbit and quickened his pace to follow.

The drone's camera captured only blurred figures weaving through the dense foliage.

[OMG I can't breathe! This chemistry is unreal!]
[The way Ethan looks at Evelyn—so tender!]
[Someone get them a marriage license STAT!]

Alexander Langley's comment suddenly popped up: [My sister is too young for dating!]

Victoria Langley immediately replied: [Young people should spend time together~]

The live chat exploded:
[Mom approves!]
[This ship has my blessing!]

Evelyn was indeed chasing rabbits. Moving with panther-like grace, she swiftly caught three more cottontails.

"That's enough." Wiping her brow, she handed the rabbits to Ethan.

As their fingers brushed, both froze. Evelyn jerked her hand back.

"Let's head back." She turned to leave.

Ethan remained still. Scanning the thick woods, his expression shifted subtly.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn glanced back in confusion.

He cleared his throat. "So...you remember the way back?"

She blinked. "Of course. Don't tell me you—"

Seeing his uncharacteristically sheepish look, realization dawned.

"You're lost?"

The tips of Ethan's ears turned pink as he nodded.

The live stream erupted:
[LOL an Oscar-winning actor who can't read directions!]
[This adorable though!]
[Evelyn, hold his hand and lead him home!]
###Chapter 370

Ethan Sullivan had never ventured this deep into the island's interior.

His entire focus remained fixed on chasing that familiar silhouette.

Evelyn Laurent darted through the undergrowth like a startled fawn.

If he didn't keep pace, he'd lose her in this unfamiliar jungle within seconds.

"You—" Evelyn's eyes widened before she lowered her voice. "I swear I won't tell anyone."

Her fingers brushed the lavalier mic clipped to her collar.

The live stream erupted.

[LOL! CEO Ethan is directionally challenged!]
[No wonder he's clinging to her—afraid of getting lost!]
[OMG this is too adorable!]

Ethan massaged his temples.

He'd noticed the recording device ages ago.

But seeing Evelyn's concerned expression made it irrelevant.

Worth it, just to hear her laugh.

"Let's go," he murmured.

They carried four cottontails between them, the rope swaying like an invisible red thread.

Comments flooded the screen:

[This looks like a wedding procession!]
[I brought the marriage certificate!]
[Qixi Couple forever!]

Netizens photoshopped the scene into a lavish wedding within minutes.

Crimson silk gowns. Gold-embroidered veils.

The five Langley brothers glared at their screens, faces stormy.

Victoria Langley, however, beamed as she saved every edited image.

"Now this suits my Evelyn," she murmured.

——

Top floor, Sullivan Group headquarters.

Vincent Sullivan slammed his pen down.

Rubbing his aching wrist, he pulled up the live stream with gritted teeth.

"You brat," he growled at the screen where two figures walked side by side. "Screw this up again and don't bother coming home."

His reflection in the office windows mirrored his shifting temper.

Beyond the glass, the sunset stained the clouds blood-red.
###Chapter 371

"Since Miss Su is Dr. Chen's friend, there's no need to question Stellar Group's qualifications." Gu Yiran turned to Yuan Lifei with an authoritative tone. "Lifei, cancel the bidding event in three days. You'll personally handle the agency negotiations with Miss Su. Ensure she receives the highest level of hospitality."

"Understood, Elder Gu." Yuan Lifei bowed slightly, her eyes flickering with astonishment as she stole another glance at Chen Tianyang.

A ripple of joy shimmered in Su Muyu's eyes as she gazed gratefully at Chen Tianyang.

Chen Tianyang merely gave a faint nod, as if it were nothing more than a trivial favor.

"Dr. Chen, please come with me. Mr. Xu, you too." Gu Yiran and Xu Qingshan flanked Chen Tianyang, escorting him toward the inner chambers.

The banquet hall buzzed with shifting expressions—first shock, then awe, settling into deep reverence.

From a distance, Shi Zihang's eyes bulged. "Holy shit! Boss is on another level! Even Elder Gu defers to him. This tops that showdown with Sun Shaogang!"

"I've always said Tianyang shines brightest wherever he goes." Han Muqing lifted her chin proudly, eyes gleaming with admiration.

Shi Zihang shook his head with a wry smile. "I’m officially convinced."

Xu Zhiqiu sighed. "A true prodigy. Being born in the same era as Chen Tianyang—blessing or curse?"

Xu Kejun clenched her fists, determination burning in her gaze. "Chen Tianyang, I’ll surpass you one day."

But no one was more stunned than Su Muyu. She watched Chen Tianyang’s retreating figure and whispered, "Thank you."

Meanwhile, Feng Feiran stood frozen, his face ashen.

Elder Gu’s favor toward him had been purely out of respect for his grandfather. Yet Chen Tianyang had earned the old man’s deference through sheer merit. The gap between them was insurmountable.

"Chen Tianyang!" Feng Feiran’s nails dug into his palms, eyes blazing with venom.

The golden boy who’d been coddled since childhood had never suffered such humiliation. Women, status, connections—Chen Tianyang had crushed him in every way.

He whirled on Sun Shaogang, snarling, "This was your brilliant plan? Letting Chen Tianyang steal the spotlight? Useless! No wonder he trampled you into oblivion!"

Sun Shaogang’s expression darkened, but he dared not retort. "Young Master Feng, who could’ve predicted Elder Gu would—"

"Silence!" Feng Feiran cut him off sharply. "I want him dead tonight."

Sun Shaogang paled, then grinned savagely. "I’ll make the arrangements."

Feng Feiran leaned in, whispering instructions. Sun Shaogang’s pupils contracted. "That’s... too extreme, isn’t it?"

"No half-measures for greatness." Feng Feiran’s smile turned icy. "If I can’t have it, no one will."
###Chapter 372

The sea breeze carried a briny tang.

Julian Langley flung the rabbit away, his face turning ghostly pale.

"Ugh—"

He doubled over, dry heaving, veins bulging on his forehead.

The live stream chat exploded.

[OMG! Julian's expression is priceless!]

[10/10 performance. From smug to devastated in one second flat.]

[Ethan Sullivan: Déjà vu much?]

Evelyn Laurent watched Julian stagger toward the shoreline, her lips quirking up.

She deftly caught the rabbit, exchanging a knowing glance with Ethan.

"I'll prep the meat," she murmured.

Ethan gave a silent nod, his pant legs still dripping.

In the shallows, Julian scrubbed at his shirt like a man possessed.

"Ethan Sullivan!" He glared at the approaching figure, teeth clenched. "You knew this would happen, didn't you?"

Ethan calmly rolled up his sleeves. "I warned you not to grab it."

"That was a warning?" Julian hurled the sodden shirt into the water. "You were laughing!"

A tense silence fell as they both scrubbed furiously.

Thirty minutes later...

Evelyn brushed honey over rabbit meat when footsteps approached.

"Done washing?" she asked without turning.

Julian slumped down, glowering at the grill. "That damn thing deserves to be roasted."

The fire crackled, fat sizzling as rich aromas filled the air.

Bianca Fairchild handed Evelyn skewered seafood. "Should we grill these too?"

"Mm." Evelyn rotated the spit. "I'll make another cage later."

Ethan crouched, poking the remaining rabbit. "Keeping it as rations?"

"Better than fishing every day," Evelyn chuckled.

The scent drifted on the breeze.

Beatrice Quincy yanked open her tent flap.

"What smells so good?" She inhaled deeply, stomach growling.

Nearby, Rachel Clemenson stumbled toward the aroma.

"Is that...roast meat?" She swallowed hard, steps quickening.

On the island, the tantalizing fragrance teased their senses.

Who could resist a bite of hot, juicy rabbit?
###Chapter 373

Evelyn Laurent and her three companions sat around the bonfire by the rocky shore.

The flames crackled as rabbit meat sizzled on skewers. The aroma of grilled seafood filled the air.

The other two groups watched hungrily, clutching their dry hardtack and sour wild berries.

Beatrice Quincy swallowed hard. "Where did you get rabbits?"

Rachel Clemenson stepped closer, her stomach growling. "Yeah, Evelyn. There are rabbits on this island?"

Without looking up, Evelyn pointed casually. "Over there."

Following her gesture, Rachel spotted three live rabbits tied beneath a tree near their camp.

"Evelyn!" Rachel's eyes lit up. "Can we trade for one?"

She crouched to untie the ropes without waiting for an answer. "We can exchange supplies. Name your price."

Crystal Rothschild stood nearby, her gaze fixed on the roasting meat. She tugged Hugo Rothschild's sleeve. "Let's go catch rabbits too."

The sea breeze carried the tantalizing scent of food as Rachel's fingers brushed the knot.

Evelyn suddenly lifted her gaze, eyes sharp as daggers. "Who said you could touch that?"

Rachel froze mid-motion, her smile stiffening.

"Hungry?" Evelyn turned the skewers with deliberate slowness. "Go hunt your own."

The firelight flickered across her face as a cold smirk curved her lips.
###Chapter 374

Evelyn Laurent's eyes turned icy as the aroma of roasted rabbit wafted from her hands.

"No trade."

Her two-word refusal cut through the air like a blade.

Rachel Clemenson's outstretched hand froze midair, surprise flashing across her face. "Why? We're offering double the supplies."

She bit her lip, voice trembling. "We're all contestants on the same show..."

"Competitors," Evelyn interrupted with a mocking smirk. "The director said we survive by our own skills."

Rachel paled.

Leo Clemenson stepped forward. "Evelyn Laurent! You're being selfish!"

He shielded his sister, outrage burning in his eyes. "It's just a damn rabbit."

Evelyn rose slowly, handing the roasting stick to Ethan Sullivan.

"Get out of my camp."

Her quiet command made the air itself seem to solidify.

Rachel's eyes welled up as she tugged her brother back. "Forget it, Leo..."

Crystal Rothschild hurried to mediate. "We can hunt our own food."

Hugo Rothschild remained silent.

He leaned against a tree trunk, wolf-like eyes locked on Evelyn with predatory intensity.

Ethan moved between them, his protective stance unmistakable.

"Enough." His warning glare at Hugo preceded a gentle touch on Evelyn's shoulder. "Don't waste anger on irrelevancies."

Evelyn sat back down, firelight carving sharp shadows across her stoic profile.

The Clemenson siblings retreated in defeat.

Hugo chuckled low, his interest visibly deepening.

This dangerous woman...

Grew more fascinating by the minute.
###Chapter 375

Hugo Rothschild's gaze was as sharp as a blade, clashing with Ethan Sullivan's across the distance.

Sparks seemed to fly in the air.

Neither man was willing to back down.

Julian Langley immediately sensed the tension, his icy glare fixed on Hugo. "How dare you kidnap my Evelyn?"

His voice dripped with frost.

"If you want rabbit meat, catch it yourself." Julian shielded Evelyn Laurent with his body. "Don't expect her to serve you."

Rachel Clemenson stood nearby, her nails digging into her palms.

Why?

Why did Evelyn get protection from two men?

She stared at Evelyn's delicate face, resentment flashing in her eyes.

That bitch must have seduced Ethan and Julian with her looks.

What infuriated her even more was that Hugo's attention remained fixed on Evelyn.

This man, always cold and distant, showed interest only in her.

"Let's go," Rachel forced out through gritted teeth, her voice laced with feigned hurt. "We're clearly not welcome here."

She deliberately let out a bitter laugh. "We don't belong in their world."

Before leaving, Hugo cast one last lingering look at Evelyn.

But she didn’t even glance his way.

Beatrice Quincy eyed the golden-brown rabbit meat roasting over the fire, swallowing hard.

"Brother," she tugged at Xander Quincy's sleeve. "I want some."

When Xander frowned, she added, "Can you trade with them?"

"No." His refusal was firm. "We’ll catch our own."

Liam Croix chimed in, "We set up traps. Should get something soon."

"Self-reliance is best," Lucas Croix agreed.

Beatrice bit her lip in frustration but had no choice but to follow them away.

In the firelight, Evelyn’s profile looked especially soft.

Ethan and Julian both turned to her at the same time, their gazes warm.
###Chapter 376

Silence finally returned after the two groups walked away.

Evelyn Laurent focused on turning the rabbit meat over the fire, brushing it with a secret sauce. The rich aroma filled the air.

Julian Langley stared hungrily at the roasting rabbit, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Patience," Evelyn chuckled, deftly tearing off a leg.

She handed the first foreleg to Julian, the second to Ethan Sullivan. She and Bianca Fairchild each took a hind leg.

The four dug in eagerly.

The rabbit was crispy outside and tender inside, its juices bursting between their teeth. Julian devoured his entire foreleg in just a few bites.

Evelyn used her combat knife to divide the remaining meat.

Soon, the rabbit was completely gone, but they still craved more. After finishing some grilled fish and shrimp, they leaned back against the tree, satisfied.

The shade enveloped Evelyn like an umbrella.

She stretched out, finding a comfortable position to lie down. Bianca settled beside her while Julian took the other side.

Ethan, sitting beyond Julian, gazed at Evelyn with a heavy expression.

If not for the change in groupings, he would have been the one by her side.

"I'm going to nap," Evelyn yawned, her eyelids drooping.

The morning's exertion had drained her, and drowsiness now took over.

Ethan frowned. "Not going back to the tent?"

"Too stuffy," she waved him off.

The midday island sun was scorching, turning the tent into a sauna. Evelyn hated the heat, preferring the cool shade beneath the tree.

Silently, Ethan removed his jacket and spread it beneath her. "Don't catch a chill."

She didn't refuse, resting her head on his tailored suit as she drifted off. Julian, too, succumbed to sleep.

Bianca exchanged a knowing glance with Ethan.

"I'll sleep in the tent," she whispered. "My wound shouldn't be exposed to the wind."

With that, she left.

Ethan carefully moved closer to Evelyn.

He studied her sleeping face. Compared to when they first met, her cheeks had filled out, no longer gaunt from malnutrition.

Now, her skin glowed with health under the dappled sunlight.

A tender smile touched Ethan's eyes.

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting golden flecks on her lashes. Unable to resist, he reached out and gently brushed away a stray lock of hair from her forehead.
###Chapter 377

Evelyn Laurent and Julian Langley slept soundly beneath the shade of the trees.

Ethan Sullivan leaned against the trunk beside Evelyn, his gaze tender as he watched her. He held a broad palm leaf in his hand, gently fanning it to send cool breezes her way.

The light wind brushed past, easing the furrow between Evelyn's brows from the heat. Ethan's eyes softened with concern as he noticed the fine beads of sweat on her forehead.

He recalled the investigative files—the image of a young girl studying late into the night in a shabby rented room. Despite the harsh conditions, she had maintained an astonishing passion for learning. That same resilience now allowed her to sleep peacefully on the hard ground.

As the sea breeze picked up, Ethan set the palm leaf aside and closed his eyes to rest.

The cameraman adjusted his equipment before taking a short break himself. Filming Evelyn was physically demanding—she moved with the agility of a sprite, often leaving him breathless as he chased after her.

When Evelyn awoke, the sunlight had lost its scorching intensity. She stretched and sat up, noticing that the figure beside her had changed from Bianca Fairchild to Ethan.

Sensing her movement, Ethan slowly opened his eyes. In that first moment of eye contact, his gaze was still hazy with sleep—but the instant he recognized her, warmth flooded his expression. "Sleep well?" he murmured, keeping his voice low.

Evelyn turned her face away slightly. "Not bad," she replied softly.

Her eyes caught on the palm leaf resting near Ethan's hand, and something stirred in her chest. "Were you fanning me?"

Ethan smiled and nodded. That simple gesture sent an unfamiliar ripple through her heart.

"Sis, you're awake!" Julian rubbed his eyes as he sat up, wincing as he massaged his lower back. "This ground is brutal. My back's killing me."

He turned to Evelyn with concern. "You okay?"

She shook her head. Sleeping outdoors was nothing new to her.

Then she glanced at Ethan. "What about you? Are you uncomfortable?"

The corner of Ethan's mouth curved up. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows across his striking features—his smile held an inexplicable allure.
###Chapter 378

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the living room. Evelyn Laurent was organizing the medical kit with her head bowed.

Ethan Sullivan leaned against the sofa, his long fingers pressing gently against his lower back.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn looked up just in time to catch his slight frown.

Ethan lifted his gaze, warmth shimmering in his eyes. "Just a little sore."

His voice was soft, but it sent a shiver through Evelyn's fingertips.

"Do you want—" Before she could finish, Julian Langley stormed over.

"Ethan Sullivan!" Julian gritted his teeth. "Stop pretending to be pitiful!"

Ethan lowered his lashes, silently massaging his back.

Evelyn sighed and patted the sofa. "Third Brother, come here."

Julian eyed her suspiciously before sitting down. The next second, a pair of delicate hands settled on his shoulders.

"Hiss—" He sucked in a sharp breath.

Evelyn's fingers pressed precisely into his pressure points with just the right amount of force.

"Feel better?" she asked softly.

Julian half-closed his eyes like a contented cat. "You're amazing, Evie!"

He shot Ethan a smug look, only to find the man staring intently at Evelyn's profile.

The live chat exploded:

[Julian's asking for a beating!]
[Ethan's gaze is lethal!]
[Evie's technique is so professional!]

When the massage ended, Julian rolled his shoulders. "When did you learn this, Evie?"

"From Grandpa Liu back in the village." Evelyn's eyes softened slightly.

She suddenly remembered the elders of White Stone Village and made a mental note to visit soon.

"Your turn." She turned to Ethan.

Surprise flickered in Ethan's eyes before he obediently took his seat.

The moment Evelyn's hands touched his shoulders, Julian's eyes widened.

"Wait—Evie, you—"

Ethan's lips curved slightly. Out of the camera's view, his fingers brushed lightly against Evelyn's wrist.
###Chapter 379

Julian Langley glared at Ethan Sullivan, his eyes burning with fury.

Evelyn Laurent's slender fingers rested lightly on Ethan's shoulders, massaging with practiced ease.

Ethan's eyes were half-closed, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"Evelyn!" Julian shot to his feet. "Let me do it!"

He stormed over in three strides, reaching to pull Evelyn away.

She didn't budge. "Third Brother, this requires technique."

"I'm a fast learner!" Julian retorted stubbornly.

Ethan opened his eyes, amusement dancing in his gaze. "The Oscar-winning actor should rest."

A vein throbbed at Julian's temple.

He stared daggers at Ethan's contented expression, itching to yank him from the chair.

"Third Brother," Evelyn sighed. "Your pressure is too strong."

Julian looked thunderstruck.

Him? An acclaimed actor, rejected by his own sister for being too rough?

Ethan chuckled. "Evelyn's technique is indeed professional."

Her fingertips glided over his shoulders with perfect precision.

Ethan could feel the warmth of her touch, the faint floral scent clinging to her.

He remembered their first meeting—when she'd shattered a sandbag with one punch.

That explosive strength now controlled with such delicate mastery.

"Done." Evelyn withdrew her hands.

Ethan rolled his shoulders. "Much better."

He stood and circled behind her. "My turn."

Julian bristled instantly. "Don't you dare!"

He seized Ethan's collar, murder in his eyes.

"Third Brother." Evelyn caught Julian's wrist. "It's just a massage."

She sat down and nodded to Ethan. "Your turn."

Ethan's long fingers settled on her shoulders, impossibly gentle.

Julian stood rigid, knuckles cracking from clenched fists.

His glare fixed on Ethan's hands, already calculating how many extra gym sessions he'd need.

[Julian's face is killing me!]

[Ethan's technique looks pro!]

[Anyone else see Julian crushing the armrest?]
###Chapter 380

Julian Langley's glare could have flayed Ethan Sullivan alive, as if watching a thief steal his most prized possession.

[LMAO, little sister made it crystal clear she's done with the Oscar winner]

[Today's emotional damage to Julian Langley is worse than 100 consecutive NG takes]

Absolutely true.

On the show's premiere day, Julian suffered a series of brutal blows.

Regret gnawed at him.

He'd brought Evelyn to this island reality show hoping she'd relax—and more importantly, stay far away from that punk Ethan.

Yet the bastard had followed them like a haunting spirit.

Now separating them seemed impossible.

He'd made a terrible mistake.

If he'd known this would happen, he'd never have taken this gig.

No—he should've kept the filming location top secret, ensuring Ethan never caught wind of it.

Or stationed bodyguards around Evelyn 24/7!

The audacity of this guy!

Julian ground his teeth watching Ethan massage Evelyn's shoulders with professional precision.

He nearly cracked a molar.

When the massage ended, Evelyn rotated her neck approvingly. "Not bad."

Ethan's martial arts training gave him exceptional muscle control. His fingers worked with perfect pressure.

"At your service anytime," he smiled.

Evelyn moved to inspect the partially dried vines—perfect for weaving.

She started with rabbit cages. Fresh kills tasted best.

Her fingers flew. The vines became living extensions of her hands, transforming into intricate cages with astonishing speed.

Julian's eyes burned. "Evie...you used to do this often?" His voice cracked with心疼.

"Mm. Two bucks per basket."

She'd learned the craft from Granny Sun in the countryside.

Bamboo would've been faster, but vines worked.

After finishing the cages, she quickly taught the three men basic mat-weaving techniques before grabbing her combat knife.

Ethan stood to follow.

She waved him off.

Fidgeting, he resumed weaving while stealing glances toward the trees.

The vines creaked under his grip.

What was she doing?

Was she safe?

Every fiber of him screamed to chase after her.
###Chapter 381

Evelyn Laurent moved through the trees, her combat knife in hand.

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows across her body.

The cameraman followed closely behind, his lens trained on her every move.

She paused, scanning the surrounding trees.

Resources were scarce on the island. She had to use what was available to build a shelter.

A wooden cabin was the best option.

Tents were too stuffy—she hated that suffocating feeling.

Evelyn selected several trees of the right thickness.

She weighed the knife in her hand, then swung it through the air.

The blade sliced through the wind with a sharp whistle.

"Step back," she said without turning.

The cameraman instinctively retreated.

Evelyn bent her knees slightly and gripped the knife with both hands.

A flash of steel.

Crack!

The trunk split cleanly in half.

The cameraman’s hand jerked.

The live chat exploded.

[What the hell?!]
[That technique is insane!]
[She cut down a tree with a knife? In one strike?!]

The cut was smooth, as if made by machinery.

Without hesitation, Evelyn turned to the next tree.

Another swing.

Three more trees fell in quick succession.

She tied the four trunks together and dragged them back with a rope.

The five-meter logs felt weightless in her grasp.

The cameraman had to jog to keep up.

[Is she even human?]
###Chapter 382

[That strength is unreal!]

Rachel Clemenson heard the commotion and rushed over just in time to see it.

Her eyes widened, lips trembling.

"That’s impossible..."

Evelyn walked past her, dragging the lumber without breaking stride.

Rachel’s gaze locked onto the perfectly clean cuts.

Her face drained of color.
Sunlight dappled through the leaves onto the center of the camp.

All eyes froze when Evelyn Laurent returned dragging four thick tree trunks.

Rachel Clemenson's nails dug deep into her palms.

She stared at the trees, lips twisting into a sneer. "The production crew must be working overtime."

Leo Clemenson immediately caught her drift. "Sis, connections are everything these days. Regular folks like us should know our place."

Crystal Rothschild frowned. "Stop spreading rumors. The cameras are rolling."

"So what?" Rachel raised her voice. "With today's editing technology, who knows what'll end up on screen?"

She deliberately glanced toward the cameras, already imagining the trending hashtags.

Hugo Rothschild's gaze turned glacial.

"Brains are useful things." His thin lips barely moved. "Pity you lack them."

Rachel's face stiffened. "Hugo—"

"Don't call me that." His voice cut like ice. "It disgusts me."

Leo jumped up. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"Exactly what I said." Hugo's smile was arctic. "The air turns foul around you."

He turned to pull Crystal away. "We're switching teams."

"You can't!" Rachel shrieked. "The director won't allow it!"

Hugo didn't look back. "Then we quit."

His quiet words silenced the entire camp.

Rachel's face drained of color.

She never expected Hugo to go this far.

Evelyn seemed to notice the commotion and glanced their way.

Rachel immediately straightened, projecting her voice. "Don't get cocky! The audience sees everything!"

Hugo paused mid-step.

He turned, eyes colder than glacial ice. "One more word against her..."

The unspoken threat hung heavy in the air.

Rachel involuntarily stepped back.

Only when Hugo was out of earshot did she regain her composure, trembling with rage.

"Sis..." Leo began hesitantly.

"Shut up!" Rachel hissed through clenched teeth. "Let's see how long she can keep up this act!"

Her venomous gaze locked onto Evelyn's retreating figure, eyes burning with malice.
###Chapter 383

Hugo Rothschild grabbed Crystal Rothschild's wrist and strode away without looking back.

Rachel Clemenson stood frozen in place, her eyes instantly welling up with tears.

Large teardrops rolled down her cheeks. "They... they're so cruel..."

She covered her face and sobbed.

Leo Clemenson hurried over and wrapped an arm around his sister's shoulders. "Don't pay attention to trash like that!"

Crystal Rothschild was a rising starlet.

Who did Hugo Rothschild think he was?

A nobody daring to act so arrogantly?

Just wait until they got back—her fans would teach him a lesson.

A flash of malice flickered in Leo's eyes.

Neither of them noticed the live stream chat exploding with outrage.

[Is Rachel out of her mind? I used to think she was genuine, but now she’s just pathetic!]

[Disgusting! She’s been targeting Evelyn Laurent since the first episode!]

[What did Evelyn ever do to her? Can’t handle losing so she accuses others of cheating?]

[Get her off the show! I can’t stand her!]

The barrage of hate flooded the screen.

Evelyn Laurent stood nearby, having heard every word of their exchange.

Her gaze turned icy as she hoisted four massive trees and strode toward the Clemenson siblings.

"Did I hear something about cheating?"

Her cold voice made Rachel flinch.

Looking up, Rachel saw Evelyn standing before her, effortlessly holding four trees with one hand, her eyes sharp as blades.

Both siblings instinctively took a step back.

Leo forced a sneer. "Stop pretending. You think waving around props makes you impressive?"

Without a word, Evelyn released her grip.

BOOM—

The four trees slammed into the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.

The deep drag marks left behind proved they were real.

"Pick them up," Evelyn said coolly.

Leo scoffed. "They’re just props. Anyone could lift them."

He moved to step forward, but Rachel yanked him back.

She smirked at Evelyn. "Cut the act. Do you really want us to expose you right here?"

"Idiots." Evelyn’s lips curled in disdain.

Rachel’s face flushed red with anger. She grabbed one of the ropes and yanked with all her strength.

The trees didn’t budge.

Her face drained of color.

These... were real?
###Chapter 384

Rachel's palms were slick with cold sweat.

Her fingers trembled uncontrollably.

She stared at the scattered equipment parts on the ground, her throat tight.

"I..." Her lips parted, but no sound came out.

Leo yanked her arm. "Rachel, we need to go!"

They fled like rabbits chased by hunters, their footsteps frantic.

Evelyn's silhouette dragging four trees cast a harsh shadow under the sunlight.

"How could she..." Leo's voice caught in his throat.

Rachel dug her nails deep into her palms.

The director's furious roar echoed from afar. "Rachel! Have you lost your mind?"

The cameraman cradled the broken camera, his eyes red-rimmed. "My livelihood..."

Rachel's lips turned bloodless.

She realized her slap might have destroyed more than just the camera.

"It's over..." she murmured.

Leo pulled out his phone, fingers flying across the screen. "I'm calling the PR team now."

The live chat exploded.

[Is Rachel insane?]
[That's intentional destruction of production property!]
[First accusing Evelyn of cheating, now smashing cameras. These siblings are something else.]

Evelyn dropped the trees with a thud, kicking up dust.

She turned just in time to see Rachel's fleeing figure.

"Tch." Her lips curled in disdain.

The director stormed over. "Evelyn, about what just—"

"Not my problem," she cut him off. "Someone's reaping what they sowed."

The director hesitated, then sighed.

Rachel's hysterical scream pierced the air. "It was an accident! Stop filming!"

Evelyn brushed wood chips from her hands, her gaze icy.

This farce was only beginning.
###Chapter 385

The confrontation between Rachel and Leo Clemenson with Evelyn Laurent was captured live on camera.

The danmu exploded instantly.

[Are the Clemenson siblings insane? Do they think viewers are stupid?]

[LOL! Accusing someone of cheating when they can't even scrape bark off trees!]

[Watching them turn purple struggling with those four trees made me spit out my breakfast!]

[I knew something was off about them last episode. Karma's a bitch!]

[Picking a fight with the Laurent heiress? Serves them right!]

The livestream's popularity skyrocketed.

Rachel's fan club president publicly announced withdrawing support.

[Three years of fandom—wasted. I'm done.]

[Assaulting cameramen? Career suicide.]

[Someone check these siblings for mental instability.]

Evelyn remained oblivious.

She dragged four massive trees single-handedly through the forest like it was nothing.

At the campsite, Ethan Sullivan was weaving vines when rustling sounds startled him.

His pupils dilated as Evelyn emerged dragging the timber.

"Evelyn!"

Ethan sprinted forward.

The bundled trees left deep furrows in the dirt.

"Why didn't you call me?" His voice tightened.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Could you have carried them?"

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed.

Gripping the ropes, his muscles strained against the sunlight.

The trees lifted inch by inch.

Ten steps.

Twenty.

Beads of sweat formed on his forehead.

"Not bad." Evelyn whistled.

Ethan lowered the load with a wry smile.

Now he understood the gap between them firsthand.

"Let me try!" Julian Langley bounded over.

Seeing Ethan's raw palms and Evelyn's effortless poise, the teenager's mouth twitched.

"Sis, are you actually a robot?"

Danmu erupted again.

[Ethan actually moved them?!]

[The real shocker is Evelyn doing it ONE-HANDED!]

[The Laurent heiress lives up to her legend.]

Meanwhile, Rachel's agency convened an emergency meeting.

The director slammed a folder on the table.

"Issue an apology statement. NOW."
###Chapter 386

Julian Langley rushed forward eagerly and grabbed the rope.

"Hey—"

With a sudden burst of strength, his face flushed crimson.

The rope pulled taut, but the four trees didn't budge an inch.

Gritting his teeth, veins bulging on his forehead, he barely managed to drag them a short distance.

"Huff..." Julian released the rope, bracing his hands on his knees as he panted. "Evelyn, you..."

His gaze lifted to Evelyn Laurent, filled with astonishment.

Where did this girl get such inhuman strength?

Evelyn pressed her lips together in a faint smile.

She had always been unusually strong since childhood.

Add to that three years of training under that mysterious Tai Chi master in the park.

The old man often called her a once-in-a-century martial arts prodigy.

Turns out he wasn't lying.

Bianca Fairchild stood nearby, eyes wide as saucers.

The three young men exchanged glances before silently picking up the rope again.

No way were they letting a girl do such heavy labor.

Back at the campsite, Julian wiped his sweat. "Evelyn, what do you need these logs for?"

"Building a house, of course." She said it like it was the most obvious thing in the world.

Grabbing an axe, she swung it down effortlessly.

The thick tree trunks split into perfectly even planks under her hands, as if she were slicing tofu.

Four main beams were ready in no time.

The production crew held their breath.

Evelyn planted her feet firmly and wrapped her arms around a wooden pillar.

"Ha!"

With a sharp cry, the pillar sank half its length into the ground.

Silence fell over the entire site.

Julian and Ethan Sullivan swallowed hard in unison.

But Bianca clapped excitedly. "Evelyn, you're amazing!"

The live chat exploded:

[What did I just witness?!]

[Driving pillars barehanded? Is this even possible?]

[Is Evelyn some hidden martial arts master?]

[That arm strength—I bow down.]

[Someone check if the ground's made of tofu.]

Unfazed, Evelyn repeated the process.

Three more pillars stood firmly rooted.

Dusting wood chips off her hands, she nodded in satisfaction.

"Done."
###Chapter 387

The last golden rays of sunset vanished beneath the ocean's edge.

The clouds darkened into crimson streaks across the horizon.

Their plan to build a cabin had to be postponed—one day wasn't nearly enough.

Evelyn Laurent efficiently packed down the foundation before gathering vines to weave sleeping mats.

She knew Julian Langley and Ethan Sullivan too well.

These pampered young masters would never tolerate sleeping on hard ground.

As for herself? Any sturdy tree would do for the night.

The single sleeping bag naturally went to Bianca Fairchild, who was still injured.

Ethan walked silently toward the shore.

He couldn't bring himself to handle the still-twitching rabbits.

Seawater lapped at his ankles as he retrieved the fish traps Evelyn had set earlier.

Inside shimmered a few silvery fish and several feisty crabs.

Frowning at the meager haul, he grabbed a spear and dove beneath the waves.

Evelyn had exerted herself too much today—she needed proper nourishment.

Julian attempted to help with the weaving but only slowed progress.

With a resigned sigh, he went to assist Ethan instead.

Bianca's nimble fingers worked swiftly through the vines, creating neat, uniform patterns.

By full nightfall, three thick, cushioned mats lay completed.

The rich aroma of fish stew drifted through the air.

Evelyn's stomach growled traitorously.

Ethan stirred the creamy broth in a stone pot, emerald wild herbs floating atop.

"Try it," he said, handing her a brimming bowl.

Steam curled between them, glistening on his lashes.

The first sip exploded across her tongue—savory, perfectly balanced.

"Delicious," she murmured, eyes closing in pleasure as she drained the bowl.

Ethan wordlessly took the empty vessel and replaced it with another full of flaky, boneless fish.

Evelyn blinked, warmth blooming in her chest.

She ate quietly, missing how Ethan drank from the same bowl her lips had touched.

Julian's jaw clenched.

He opened his mouth to protest when Bianca's sharp glance silenced him.

Darkness fully embraced the island.

Cameramen began packing equipment.

Timothy Gold's amplified voice announced, "That's a wrap for today's live stream!"

The virtual audience erupted in dismay, demanding more footage.

Among all participants, only Evelyn's group had constructed proper shelter.

Rachel and Leo Clemenson, along with Hugo and Crystal Rothschild, received compensation packages after failing to pair up properly.

Hugo stood rigid outside his tent, moonlight stretching his shadow long and thin.

Sea breeze rustled through palm fronds.

Gazing at the star-strewn sky, Evelyn found herself... enjoying this unexpected night.
###Chapter 388

Moonlight spilled like liquid silver over the tranquil island.

The four groups of guests settled in for their first night in the wilderness.

Beatrice Quincy tossed and turned inside her flimsy tent.

Something kept crawling over her sleeping bag.

"Damn this show!" She gritted her teeth and rolled onto her side. The hard ground dug into her bones.

The thin grass mat did nothing to cushion the unyielding earth.

Regret gnawed at her for signing up.

With her phone confiscated, she had no distractions to pass the time.

"Should've told my agent to reject this gig..." She muttered before resigning herself to sleep.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Laurent's group slept soundly.

Julian Langley sighed contentedly on his plush grass bedding.

"Evie, you're a genius." He marveled. "This beats sleeping on rocks any day."

Evelyn chuckled softly. "Get some rest, Julian. Dawn comes early."

Ethan Sullivan leaned against the tent entrance, watching the siblings with quiet amusement.

He thanked his stars Evelyn had accompanied Julian.

If Theodore Langley—the kitchen disaster—had come instead, they'd still be struggling to start a fire.

Not to mention that luxury yacht incident...

A smirk tugged at Ethan's lips.

Night deepened.

Salty sea breezes whispered through the camp.

All four sites had fallen silent.

Then—

"Help! Someone help!"

A bloodcurdling scream shattered the night.

Julian bolted upright, pale as chalk. "Snake? Where?"

Ethan already had the tent flap open. "Rachel and Leo's site."

Moonlight revealed Rachel Clemenson stumbling out in tears.

"A snake—inside our tent!" Her voice trembled.

Leo Clemenson hopped around like a madman. "Production! Get over here!"

Chaos erupted.

Other guests scrambled to inspect their own tents.

Beatrice fled the campsite entirely, frozen in terror on open ground.

Crew members arrived in a flurry of flashlight beams.

"What happened?" The director demanded.

Rachel pointed a shaking finger. "In there...a black snake..."

Staff approached cautiously.

A dark shape darted out.

Gasps erupted.

The flashlight beam chased the fleeing creature—

A terrified iguana.

The director exhaled. "Just a local lizard. Harmless."

Rachel collapsed sobbing.

No one would sleep tonight.
###Chapter 389

Rachel Clemenson's face was deathly pale.

Tears streaked her cheeks as she stumbled out of the tent.

Leo Clemenson followed close behind, losing a shoe in his haste.

The siblings fled in disarray. Rachel tripped over a tree root, slamming her knees against the ground.

She barely registered the pain as she scrambled up and kept running.

"Snake! Help!"

Her shrill scream pierced the night, jolting the entire campsite awake.

Crew members rushed over with tools in hand. Other guests peeked out from their tents.

Evelyn Laurent sat up languidly, a mocking glint in her eyes.

She adjusted her sleeping bag, making no move to rise.

Inside the tent, Timothy Gold froze, flashlight in hand.

A thumb-sized snake slithered lazily across the ground, flinching at the sudden light.

"Seriously?"

He picked up the trembling creature and stepped outside with a sigh.

Rachel's expression twisted when she saw the tiny snake.

"You screamed over this?" Beatrice Quincy crossed her arms, irritation sharp in her voice.

The actress looked murderous after being woken abruptly.

Rachel's lips quivered, speechless.

"Weren't you the one who bragged about catching snakes barehanded in the countryside?" Hugo Rothschild's voice was glacial.

His piercing gaze pinned Rachel in place.

Leo jutted his chin defensively. "She was ambushed!"

"Ambushed?" Hugo's laugh was icy. "This thing moves slower than a snail."

Rachel's face burned crimson. Tears welled in her eyes.

Timothy rubbed his temples. "Everyone disperse. We have filming tomorrow."

As he turned away, he couldn't suppress a weary sigh.

These siblings were becoming insufferable.
###Chapter 390

These two are absolute morons.

Their live stream viewership can't even compare to the Croix brothers' numbers.

Instead of damage control, they keep digging their own graves.

Pathetic.

They'll be completely canceled after the show.

Serves them right.

Who told them to scheme against Evelyn Laurent?

This is pure karma.

Timothy Gold is stunned.

Only one day into filming, and these contestants have already self-destructed!

Rachel and Leo Clemenson's follower count is plummeting. The entire internet is roasting them.

Timothy won't bother warning them.

They're beyond saving.

No point wasting his breath.

The drama quickly fades.

The contestants retreat to their quarters.

Some sleep like logs. Others toss and turn all night.

Beatrice Quincy belongs to the latter group.

She keeps imagining snakes slithering under her bed...

Dawn arrives before she finally dozes off.

The exhaustion leaves her looking haggard when filming resumes.

[Why does Beatrice look so tired? Bad night?]

[The Clemensons have dark circles down to their chins!]

[What happened last night?]

[Evelyn's group seems perfectly rested though.]

Viewers speculate wildly, but no one knows the truth.

Day two finds Evelyn constructing her cabin.

With all materials gathered, she works tirelessly at the campsite.

Watching her build is mesmerizing.

After laying the foundation, she weaves walls from branches and vines.

She even crafts a functional door.

Her progress is astonishingly fast.

While other teams still struggle for food, her cabin nears completion.

Ethan Sullivan and her brothers assist.

By dusk, the rustic cabin stands finished.

Crude but superior to the other teams' tents.

Timothy runs his hands through his hair in frustration.

Their pace shatters all expectations.

Their food situation is equally impressive.

All four have mastered spearfishing.

Yes, even Julian Langley finally got the hang of it after relentless practice.

Bianca Fairchild has also perfected the technique.

Their meals spark envy—fresh seafood, grilled fish, roasted rabbit.

Plus wild berries Evelyn foraged from the woods.

Tart and juicy.

Perfect palate cleansers after rich meats.

The other teams immediately copy her.

If Evelyn picked those berries, they must be safe!

Probably delicious too.
###Chapter 391

Evelyn Laurent paid no attention to the others' progress.

Even when she noticed the other three groups copying her methods—weaving grass mats, building cabins, gathering wild fruits—she merely glanced at them indifferently.

As long as they didn’t disturb her, she had no complaints.

Surprisingly, the next two days passed in unusual peace.

The other guests seemed to finally understand that survival, not competition, was the priority on this island.

Crystal Rothschild and Hugo Rothschild chose to reinforce their tent—building a cabin was too labor-intensive for just two people.

By the fourth day, all four camps had taken shape.

Evelyn’s team’s cabin remained the most impressive.

Rachel Clemenson and her brother still slept in tents. The hard bedding left Rachel sore and exhausted every morning.

Beatrice Quincy’s group had managed to build a cabin, though it stood crooked and unsteady.

Xander Quincy had woven her a comfortable grass mat, at least easing her discomfort.

Just as everyone settled into their routines, Evelyn grew restless.

She had explored nearly every corner of the island. If not for Timothy Gold stopping her, she would’ve ventured further.

Bored, she chopped down a few more trees.

This time, even Julian Langley couldn’t decipher what she was making.

She carefully stripped the bark and began carving something with her combat knife.

Julian and the others focused on gathering food.

Evelyn, however, was crafting gifts for her family.

She had decided to carve wooden figurines of them.

Though she only had a combat knife, her hands moved with astonishing precision.

The sea breeze brushed past as she worked, utterly absorbed.

Ethan Sullivan quietly gathered wild fruits, washed and sliced them, then sat beside her to feed her.

Their seamless coordination created such a warm atmosphere that Julian couldn’t help but envy them.

He tried to join, but Evelyn reminded him, "Julian, you’re blocking the light."

Grumbling, he stepped aside, shooting Ethan a resentful look.

That guy was too good at this.

Why was he always one step behind?

Julian lingered behind his sister, watching her deft fingers dance across the wood.
Twilight descended as city lights began to glow.

I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing at the glittering skyline.

My phone screen lit up suddenly. A message from Ethan Sullivan: "Meet me at our usual spot. 8 PM."

My fingers hovered over the screen before typing a single word: "Okay."

At 7:50, I pushed open the door of the secluded café.

Ethan was already seated in the corner, his slender fingers tapping rhythmically against the table.

"You're here." He looked up, his dark eyes unreadable.

I took the seat across from him. The rich aroma of coffee filled the air.

"What did you find?" I cut straight to the chase.

Ethan slid a manila envelope from his briefcase.

"Lowell Group's accounts are compromised." His voice dropped. "Someone's siphoning funds."

I flipped through the documents, my hands trembling slightly.

Each page revealed staggering sums. The endless zeros made my breath catch.

"Where is this money—" I lifted my gaze to meet his.

"Funneled into an offshore shell company." He took a sip of coffee. "Whoever's behind this is careful."

Suddenly, blinding headlights flashed through the window.

Instinctively, I turned away, shoving the files into my bag.

"Are you being followed?" Ethan's sharp eyes noticed my tension.

"Not sure." I pressed my lips together. "I've felt watched lately."

His gaze turned razor-sharp.

"Be careful around Vincent." The warning came abruptly.

My pulse jumped. "What do you mean?"

"He's been—" Ethan's words cut off as the café door burst open.

A familiar silhouette stood framed in the doorway, backlit by the streetlights.

"What a coincidence." Vincent's voice carried amused warmth. "I didn't know you two frequented this place."

My fingers tightened around my bag strap.

Ethan rose smoothly. "Mr. Lowell. Fancy seeing you here."

Vincent's gaze flickered between us. The air grew thick.

"Mind if I join you?" He pulled out the chair beside me with effortless grace.

His cologne wafted over me—spiced amber with a faint metallic tang.

"Of... course." I forced calm into my voice.

Ethan's phone vibrated sharply.

He checked the screen, his expression shifting. "Excuse me. An emergency."

Vincent smirked. "The busy life of a lawyer."

Ethan gave me a meaningful look before striding away.

Now it was just Vincent and me.

His fingers began tapping the table in the same rhythm Ethan had used earlier.

"I heard..." He leaned close, his breath warm against my ear, "you've been auditing company finances."

My blood turned to ice.

"Who told you that?" My voice came out brittle.

Vincent chuckled, his lips nearly brushing my skin.

"Nothing stays secret in this city, darling."

His hand slid to the nape of my neck. Cold as a serpent's touch.

"Especially not from you."
###Chapter 392

"My lady, I have failed you. Our outpost in the town has fallen." Yang Zuo dropped to one knee, his voice thick with suppressed fury.

The slender figure in the cave turned slowly. The violet miniskirt shimmered faintly in the dim light, revealing glimpses of pale legs. The girl's raven hair cascaded like silk, gleaming under the torchlight.

Evelyn's delicate fingers tapped lightly against the stone wall, producing crisp echoes.

"Uncle Yang, we've retreated as far as we can go." Her voice was cool, but defiance burned in her eyes.

Yang Zuo looked up at the girl's exquisite profile flickering in the firelight. The young mistress of the Sun and Moon Sect was now their last hope.

"My scouts report that the Lowell sisters and Ethan are merely passing through," Yang Zuo said grimly. "They travel without an army."

Evelyn whirled around, her skirt slicing through the air.

"Are you certain?"

"Beyond doubt." A ruthless glint flashed in Yang Zuo's eyes. "If not for Felix's interference, we would have eliminated them already."

"Felix?" Evelyn's pupils contracted. "From the Imperial City?"

Silence fell in the cave, broken only by the crackling of torches.

"My lady, retreat is no longer an option." Yang Zuo's voice turned hoarse. "We must strike first."

Evelyn walked to the cave entrance, gazing at the distant mountain ridges. The setting sun stretched her shadow long across the ground.

"How many remain with us?"

"Over ten thousand."

The girl suddenly laughed—a chilling, crystalline sound.

"You're right, Uncle Yang." When she turned, her eyes held only resolve. "If they seek our annihilation, let's see who falls first."

Yang Zuo knelt again. "I have a plan."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Speak."

"Lure them deep into Kunlun Base. Let them walk into our trap." Yang Zuo's eyes gleamed with cunning.

Evelyn ran her fingers along the coiled whip at her waist, her lips curving into a cold smile.

"Make it so." Her gentle tone sent a sudden chill through the cave. "Tonight, none of our pursuers shall leave alive."

Yang Zuo clasped his fists solemnly. "I'll arrange it at once."

Outside, dusk deepened. None could foresee the bloodbath brewing in the shadows.
###Chapter 393

Evelyn Laurent kept her head down, her fingers deftly maneuvering the carving knife.

"Of course there's one for you." Her tone was casual, as if discussing the weather.

Ethan Sullivan's lips curved slightly, his eyes shimmering with quiet delight.

He leaned back in his chair, his gaze never leaving Evelyn's hands.

At least he wouldn't have to envy Julian Langley anymore.

Bianca Fairchild inched closer, hesitating.

"You too," Evelyn said without looking up.

Bianca's eyes brightened as she immediately settled back into her seat.

The three of them watched in silence as Evelyn carved.

Wood shavings scattered as Julian's likeness gradually took shape.

"I'm going to enshrine this!" Julian cradled the finished piece like a treasure.

Evelyn shook her head. "Julian, that's unnecessary."

"But you made it with your own hands!" He stubbornly hugged the wooden figure to his chest.

Evelyn gave up arguing and picked up another block of wood.

This time, it was Ethan.

He stared intently at every movement of her hands, already deciding to save this video clip separately.

The knife glided across the wood, revealing Ethan's refined features.

Compared to the first piece, this one was noticeably more detailed.

Bianca's sculpture came next.

Then the rest of the Langley brothers.

Evelyn deliberately saved her parents' carvings for last.

She didn’t want Julian to know she’d originally planned to use Ethan’s statue as practice.

On screen, the Langley family watched, mesmerized.

The live chat exploded:

[Her technique is flawless! Every detail is perfect!]

[This reminds me of that mysterious sculptor five years ago whose works sold out instantly!]

[Could Evelyn Laurent be that legendary artist?]
###Chapter 394

The live stream comments exploded.

"Oh my god! This carving technique is divine!"

"Wait... this style looks familiar."

"Could it be NC the Legend?"

"No way. NC vanished three years ago!"

Evelyn Laurent remained absorbed in carving the wooden block, oblivious to the chatter.

Her fingers danced with practiced ease as wood shavings fluttered down.

Each stroke landed with instinctive precision.

"Done." She set down the chisel, admiring her work.

Twelve miniature statues stood in perfect formation, their clothing folds rendered in exquisite detail.

Ethan Sullivan's eyes flashed with admiration. "When did you learn this craft, Evelyn?"

Julian Langley rushed to examine the carvings. "These are uncanny!"

Evelyn massaged her sore shoulder. "Just picked it up during idle moments."

She glanced at the sky, then brightened suddenly.

"Let's chop wood for deck chairs!"

Bianca Fairchild responded instantly. "I'll help!"

Her eyes sparkled with anticipation.

These were the most carefree days she'd ever known.

No schemes from Beatrice Quincy to dodge. No icy glares from the Quincy family.

Though worried about her grandmother's safety, Bianca found unexpected solace in Evelyn's presence.

"Let's go." Evelyn grabbed an axe and headed toward the trees.

Bianca quickened her pace, making a silent vow.

She'd pay any price to save her grandmother.

Even... with her life.

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, painting dappled patterns on the ground.

Evelyn's silhouette flickered between light and shadow.

For a fleeting moment, Bianca saw her as a beacon in the darkness.
###Chapter 395

Evelyn Laurent paused briefly before nodding in agreement to Bianca Fairchild and Julian Langley's request to join her.

Having extra hands would be useful.

Besides, the sachet she wore kept snakes and insects at bay—not even mosquitoes dared approach her lately.

The four of them re-entered the dense forest.

Evelyn swung her blade with precision, felling trees one after another. This time, she deliberately chose trunks of moderate thickness for easier transport.

Back at the campsite, she requested a black marker from the production crew.

Timothy Gold silently handed her the pen, eyeing their already luxurious log cabin.

The marker had no survival value, but for them...

They might as well build a deck chair next.

Evelyn took the pen and immediately got to work.

Julian and the other two gathered around, watching in awe as her hand moved swiftly across the wood.

Their only tasks were stripping bark and cutting logs to the measurements she marked.

[What is Evelyn drawing? It looks so professional!]

[Those lines... Are those mortise and tenon joints?]

[How does she even know this?!]

The live stream exploded in popularity, viewership surpassing ten million.

The audience held their breath, wondering what surprise this prodigy would unveil next.

Wood shavings flew as the timber in Evelyn's hands gradually took shape.

"Sis, what exactly are you making?" Julian couldn't resist asking.

"A deck chair," she replied without looking up. "We can't just sit on the ground to sunbathe."

Timothy Gold and Eugene York spat out their tea simultaneously in the control room.

While other teams struggled for basic survival, these people were—building! A! Deck! Chair!

[LMAO! Others are surviving in the wild, and they're vacationing!]

[I'd love to see the other teams' reactions!]

[Evelyn is legendary! This group always breaks the mold!]

The chat erupted instantly.

Evelyn remained focused on carving the wooden slats, oblivious to becoming the internet's latest sensation.
###Chapter 396

Evelyn Laurent remained oblivious to the others' thoughts.

Her fingers traced the wood grain as she meticulously arranged lumber of various shapes.

"Measure this for me," she said without looking up at Ethan Sullivan.

Ethan immediately set down his tools and reached for the measuring tape.

Julian Langley watched in fascination. "Where did you learn these skills, little sister?"

Evelyn only smiled in response.

The sun dipped toward the horizon, casting golden light over the wooden planks covering the cabin floor.

"We can assemble it tomorrow." Evelyn stretched, her eyes alight with anticipation.

She envisioned herself reclining on the handmade deck chair, sea breeze caressing her face.

A sudden realization struck her.

Hadn't Victoria Langley gifted her an island for her birthday?

Evelyn shot to her feet, her expression shifting abruptly.

"What's wrong?" Ethan instantly noticed her change in demeanor.

"I need to see the production crew." She strode toward the exit.

Ethan fell into step beside her without hesitation. "I'm coming with you."

Julian scrambled after them. "Wait for me!"

Bianca Fairchild remained at the campsite, watching their retreating figures with thoughtful eyes.

Inside the production tent, Timothy Gold paced anxiously.

"Assistant director! Evelyn Laurent's group is approaching!" a staff member reported breathlessly.

Timothy wiped his sweaty brow. "What does she want now?"

Evelyn marched in and cut straight to the chase. "Who owns this island?"

Timothy blinked. "That's...confidential business information—"

"Do you know or not?" Evelyn's voice sharpened.

Ethan moved half a step closer, positioning himself at her side.

Timothy mopped his forehead. "We've only communicated with the owner's assistant..."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed, her pulse quickening.

Could this island truly be hers?
###Chapter 397

Julian Langley arched an eyebrow, his gaze lingering on Evelyn Laurent's face.

"Evelyn, are you asking about the owner of this island?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together and nodded.

A suspicion tugged at her mind, but she didn't dare confirm it.

Timothy Gold suddenly interjected, "Why don't you just ask Julian? He's the one who recommended this place to me."

There was no way he could've found such a perfect filming location on his own.

Julian was the mastermind behind it.

Evelyn whipped her head toward Julian.

He scratched the back of his head, looking genuinely puzzled. "Evelyn, don't you remember the island Mom gifted you?"

Timothy's eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets.

His finger trembled as he pointed at Julian.

"W-what? An island gifted to Evelyn?"

Evelyn shook her head honestly. "I don't recall."

At the time, she'd been too moved to properly examine the property documents.

Over the years, she'd received too many assets—

Luxury villas. Sports cars. Company shares.

How could she possibly remember every single one?

Julian sighed. "I thought you knew this was your island."

"Mine?"

Evelyn gasped.

Her lashes fluttered before a radiant smile bloomed across her face.

"That's perfect!"

She'd been mourning the loss of that burned-down cabin.

Now that she knew the entire island belonged to her, that shabby little hut seemed downright pathetic.

Time for renovations!

No—she'd build a seaside mansion!

Construction would start as soon as filming wrapped.

Timothy clutched his chest and staggered back two steps.

He felt like his heart was bleeding.

This revelation was too devastating!

Now he regarded Evelyn with newfound reverence.

After all...

His show's continued filming depended on the island owner's goodwill.

Ethan Sullivan stood nearby, warmth glimmering in his eyes.

He'd known the island belonged to Evelyn all along.

He'd assumed she knew too.

Who knew the scatterbrain had forgotten?

Evelyn suddenly turned toward the window, her gaze landing on the luxury yacht.

"That cruise ship—"

Ethan swiftly cut her off. "Timothy, where's that document I asked you to hold?"

Timothy hurriedly retrieved a file from the cabinet.

Ethan handed it to Evelyn without even glancing at it.

"Sign here."

Evelyn flipped open the document in confusion.

It was a yacht transfer agreement.

"Southern Cross?" she murmured, reading the name aloud.

Julian's expression darkened instantly.

That sly bastard!

He'd actually named the yacht using the second characters of both their names!

Just as Julian opened his mouth to mock him, Ethan casually slung an arm around Evelyn's shoulders.

"Do you like it?"

Evelyn bent to sign, oblivious to the tension between the two men.

The scratch of pen against paper echoed sharply in the quiet room.
###Chapter 398

Evelyn Laurent flipped through the documents in her hands, her fingertips pausing over the signature on the last page.

The name "Ethan Sullivan" was written in bold, elegant strokes, exuding an innate nobility.

She glanced up at the man beside her, the corners of her eyes lifting slightly. "You're really giving this to me?"

Ethan's lips curved into a faint smile, his gaze warm and focused. "If it makes you happy."

He would give her the world if she asked.

Evelyn abruptly closed the file and shoved it back into his hands. "I don't want it."

She hesitated before adding, "I just wanted to know where you booked this yacht."

Julian Langley, standing nearby, quietly exhaled in relief.

A flicker of surprise crossed Ethan's eyes.

Evelyn muttered under her breath, "I just don’t know what to do about seasickness..."

"You get seasick?" Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

Julian chimed in dryly, "Both of us do."

Ethan suddenly remembered Evelyn's pale face the day they arrived on the island. His chest tightened with regret. "I should have sent a helicopter for you."

Timothy Gold and Eugene York exchanged glances.

A helicopter?

Evelyn's eyes lit up. "You have a helicopter?"

Ethan chuckled, his voice low and tempting. "Not just one—I can fly it too." He leaned closer. "Want to try?"

Julian watched the scene unfold, thinking Ethan looked like a peacock flaunting its feathers.

"Absolutely!" Evelyn agreed without hesitation.

Julian rubbed his temples.

Great. His little sister was being whisked away.

Ethan made the decision on the spot. "We'll take the helicopter back after filming wraps."

The two directors huddled in the corner, clutching their modest budgets in silent despair.
###Chapter 399

Ethan Sullivan's lips curved slightly as he slid the document toward Evelyn Laurent.

"I've had this yacht prepared for you for a long time, Evelyn. It's a genuine gift."

Evelyn frowned at him.

"Why would you suddenly give me something so extravagant?"

Sunlight streamed through the porthole, illuminating the deck and making the confusion in her eyes unmistakable.

Ethan's throat moved slightly.

"Because I owe you."

All those years of letting her endure hardships, all those unnecessary agreements—they weighed heavily on his conscience.

"You don't owe me anything," Evelyn said, even more perplexed.

Julian Langley suddenly cut in.

"Oh, he definitely owes you! Just sign it, Evelyn—we're keeping this yacht!"

He shot Ethan a sharp glare as he spoke.

Evelyn shook her head.

"No, it's too much."

Her fingers absently traced the edge of the document before she realized just how little she knew about Ethan.

He remembered every detail of her preferences, yet she didn’t even know his birthday.

The realization tightened her chest.

Ethan immediately noticed the shift in her gaze, and his heart sank.

"If you won’t take it," he said, his voice lowering, "I'll donate it."

Julian nearly jumped out of his seat.

"Donate it?! Hell no—give it to me then!"

A sea breeze swept across the deck, diffusing the tension.

Evelyn watched the two men bristling at each other and found the whole scene absurdly comical.

Her gaze dropped to the gilded yacht illustration on the document, and suddenly, she remembered Ethan’s focused profile that day at the auction—when he’d won that painting for her.

"I'll take it," she said abruptly.

Both men froze.

Evelyn lifted her eyes to meet Ethan’s startled gaze and added softly,

"But on one condition."

The waves lapped against the hull, mirroring the sudden acceleration of someone’s heartbeat.
###Chapter 400

The yacht transfer procedures were incredibly tedious.

If he really wanted to donate money, why go through such a roundabout way?

A smile spread across Ethan Sullivan's eyes as he readily agreed, "If you like it, Third Brother, it's yours."

He didn't even bat an eyelid.

Julian Langley was taken aback.

Was this guy really willing to give away a multimillion-dollar yacht just to pursue Evelyn?

There had to be an ulterior motive!

Julian scoffed coldly, "If you're giving me the yacht, what will you use to impress Evelyn? Since you're so generous, Mr. Sullivan, why not throw in a couple of helicopters too?"

Helicopters weren't just something you could buy with money—they were rare luxuries.

Ethan nodded calmly. "No problem."

He smiled at Julian. "What model do you prefer, Third Brother? I'll accompany you to pick them out later."

"Deal!"

Julian blurted out before immediately pressing his lips together in frustration.

He'd agreed too quickly—it made him seem desperate.

Timothy Gold and Eugene York exchanged uneasy glances.

Could these two at least consider their feelings?

"Um..." Timothy raised a hesitant hand. "Mr. Langley, Mr. Sullivan, maybe you two should discuss this later? I'm starting to feel a little faint."

If he had to listen any longer, he might actually pass out.

Evelyn Laurent offered an apologetic smile. "Sorry for disturbing your rest."

She turned and walked out.

Now that the island ownership was confirmed, she felt much lighter.

Ethan quickly followed. "Evelyn, the yacht is yours too. And I'll add two helicopters. How does that sound?"

Evelyn stopped abruptly.

She frowned at him. "Why are you giving me such expensive gifts?"

Without waiting for his answer, she cut straight to the point. "Do you have feelings for me?"

Julian stiffened instantly.

His eyes darted between them nervously, but he chose to stay silent.

Ethan gazed deeply at Evelyn.

After a long pause, he chuckled softly. "Haven't I made it obvious enough?"

He was willing to give everything he had just to see her smile.

Evelyn pressed further. "Do you like me as I am now, or the Evelyn from back then?"

Ethan's eyes burned with intensity.

"I've figured it out."

"The one I've always loved is Evelyn Laurent."

His obsession from the past had been nothing but guilt and gratitude.

If he'd truly cared, why had he felt nothing but disgust when Sophia Lowell appeared?
###Chapter 401

The sea breeze whispered as starlight scattered across the shore.

Ethan Sullivan stood on the beach, his obsidian eyes locked onto Evelyn Laurent. His gaze held nothing but her reflection.

His heartbeat roared in his ears.

Never had he felt such nervousness. Beads of sweat formed on his palms.

Julian Langley retreated half a step, then frowned at his own hesitation. He remained silent in the shadows.

Night deepened.

The live stream had ended long ago, leaving the island in perfect stillness.

No moonlight graced the sky—only countless stars shimmering on the undulating sea.

Evelyn froze.

She never expected such a confession from Ethan.

He said the one he'd always loved was her.

From the very beginning.

Chaotic thoughts swirled through her mind.

They'd been bound by an engagement, yet resisted each other. She refused to be shackled. He waited for that little girl from his past.

Fate played its cruel joke.

That little girl turned out to be herself.

And so, the engagement dissolved.

Memories flooded her heart.

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly as she sank into contemplation.

Ethan's heart climbed into his throat.

Had he been too impulsive?

No carefully planned setting. No romantic gestures.

Just raw honesty when she asked.

But he could no longer hide his feelings.

He loved her.

From the moment he brought her back to Oceancrest, she'd captivated him.

Her radiant defiance. Her untamed spirit.

Unlike any woman he'd ever known.

A long silence passed.

Evelyn finally lifted her gaze.

Her clear eyes met Ethan's directly.

His Adam's apple bobbed as he held his breath.

This moment felt like judgment.

"I've never known much warmth in my life."

"You were the first to protect me."

Her voice remained steady. "But Ethan, I don't understand love."

Truthfully, she didn't.

Affection itself was a luxury. Love? An entirely foreign realm.

Ethan's body stiffened.

His lips pressed into a thin line, heart aching.

Not from potential rejection.

But for all the pain she'd endured.
###Chapter 402

The ocean breeze carried a briny tang as it swept across the shore.

Evelyn Laurent clenched the hem of her coat, her fingertips trembling slightly.

"Ethan Sullivan, you do make me feel... something special." Her voice faltered, nearly drowned by the crashing waves. "But I think... we should keep things as they are."

Ethan's pupils constricted sharply.

He studied her for a long moment before forcing a bitter smile. "Understood."

An invisible fist squeezed his heart.

He took half a step back, his tone eerily calm. "I overstepped."

As he turned away, his shoulders slumped under the weight of rejection.

Moonlight stretched his solitary shadow across the sand.

Evelyn's hand hovered midair before dropping limply to her side.

A dull ache spread through her chest.

She couldn't tell if it was guilt or something else twisting inside her.

Julian Langley stood in the shadows, brows furrowed.

He'd never seen his little sister look so devastated.

Even after rejecting him, her gaze still followed Ethan's retreating figure.

Waves pounded against the jagged rocks.

Ethan sat alone at the water's edge, letting the icy surf soak through his trousers.

The night wind carried traces of Evelyn's gardenia perfume.

His fists clenched until nails bit into his palms.

He shouldn't have been impulsive.

Now even friendship was impossible.

Restless fury surged through his veins.

He sprang to his feet and strode into the deepening water.

"Ethan!"

Julian's shout shattered the night.

Evelyn burst from the cabin just as the last strands of Ethan's dark hair disappeared beneath the waves.

Her heart stopped.
###Chapter 403

The ocean erupted with a deafening blast.

Evelyn Laurent's pupils contracted violently.

Her gaze locked onto the spot where Ethan Sullivan had vanished.

Churning waves swallowed the familiar silhouette.

"Ethan!"

Her anguished scream tore through the night.

She launched herself toward the black waters like an arrow from a bow.

"Evelyn!"

Julian Langley's grasping fingers closed on empty air.

He could only watch helplessly as his sister plunged into the raging sea.

Lights blazed to life in the villa.

Timothy Gold sprinted out barefoot, not even pausing for shoes.

"Christ almighty!"

Eugene York followed close behind, his face bloodless.

Bianca Fairchild stood frozen on the shore, speechless with shock.

The seawater stabbed like ice.

Evelyn thrashed through the waves, her heart hammering against her ribs.

In the distance.

Ethan floated motionless on the dark surface.

Moonlight traced the pallor of his profile.

Evelyn's fingertips trembled.

She swam desperately toward him.

Water sprayed as she seized his arm.

"Hold on!"

She broke the surface with him, her voice cracking.

Ethan's eyes flew open.

When their gazes met.

He saw her red-rimmed eyes.

"You—"

Before he could finish, Evelyn was already dragging him toward shore.

"Medic! Call an ambulance!"

Chaos erupted on the beach.

Understanding dawned on Ethan.

He gripped her wrist.

"I wasn't—"

"Shut up!" Evelyn snapped. "Save your strength!"

Wet strands clung to her face, droplets clinging to her lashes.

Ethan suddenly smiled.

Through the roar of waves.

He heard his own thunderous heartbeat.
###Chapter 404

Timothy Gold paced nervously along the shoreline, beads of sweat glistening on his forehead.

Evelyn Laurent's figure dragging Ethan Sullivan toward the shore stood out starkly under the moonlight.

In the distance, hurried footsteps approached as the hastily awakened medical team sprinted toward them with first aid kits.

The sea shimmered with silver ripples.

Ethan hesitated for only a second.

"Evelyn."

His voice was soft.

She froze mid-motion and turned to look at him.

Under the moonlight, his eyes were crystal clear.

Her arms stiffened in the water.

Ethan sighed. "I won a swimming championship at six. I can hold my breath for five minutes."

"I just needed some quiet time in the water."

His words were quiet but deliberate.

He could have pretended to faint.

But he couldn't bear to.

Couldn't bear to see her panic.

And he refused to lie to her.

Such a clumsy act wouldn't hold up under scrutiny.

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly.

A sudden realization hit her—

She had been a fool.

Her grip on Ethan loosened abruptly.

She had used every ounce of strength to drag him ashore.

The weight in her chest finally lifted.

For a moment, she thought she'd lost him forever.

Ethan watched her flustered expression, warmth flickering in his eyes. "You were worried about me?"

Though phrased as a question, it carried certainty.

Evelyn turned her face away. "I didn't want you dying here and ruining the mood."

Her voice wavered.

Ethan chuckled lowly. "I don't plan on dying."

His tone was serious.

After surviving a childhood of schemes to reach where he was today—

More importantly—

He hadn't won her over yet.

The tips of Evelyn's ears flushed pink. "Oh."

The sea breeze brushed past, but her heartbeat refused to steady.

Ethan gently took her hand. "The water's cold. Let's go back."

"Mm."

After swimming just two meters, Evelyn suddenly paled.

A sharp pain shot through her right leg, and she sank beneath the waves.

Ethan reacted instantly, pulling her back up.

Onshore, frantic footsteps echoed as a lifebuoy was thrown into the sea.

He held her shivering body tightly.

Instinctively, she wrapped her arms around his neck.

The crew hauled them both onto the sand.

Julian Langley rushed over, his voice shaking. "What happened?"

The night wind cut like ice.

Timothy swiftly wrapped them both in blankets.

Ethan ignored the question, his hands massaging Evelyn's cramped calf. "Does it still hurt?"
###Chapter 405

Evelyn Laurent had always been in excellent physical condition.

But that burst of energy was astonishing. She sprinted toward the shore at an incredible speed and plunged into the icy seawater without hesitation. The intense mental strain finally took its toll on her calf muscles.

Only when she confirmed Ethan Sullivan was safe did her nerves relax slightly. The moment she let her guard down, the pain of cramping seized her.

Fortunately, Ethan reacted swiftly.

His large, well-defined hands pressed firmly against her cramped calf, applying just the right amount of pressure.

The pain soon subsided.

After a brief hesitation, she offered him half of her blanket. "Don’t catch a cold either."

A flicker of warmth passed through Ethan's eyes.

Julian Langley finally snapped out of his daze and threw a spare blanket at Ethan. He rushed to his sister’s side and wrapped her tightly. "Evelyn, how could you be so reckless?"

He hadn’t even had time to stop her.

It had started with a worried shout for Ethan.

But Evelyn’s reaction was alarmingly intense.

Worse, she had seen the exact moment Ethan submerged beneath the waves.

Julian’s heart ached for her.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, silent.

Ethan continued massaging her calf, casually draping the blanket over himself, his gaze never leaving her.

"Get on the boat and rest. Don’t risk getting sick," urged Timothy Gold, still shaken by the incident.

The commotion had drawn everyone’s attention.

Beatrice Quincy and the others hurried over, only to learn it was a false alarm. Rachel Clemenson couldn’t resist sneering, "Such an overreaction."

Leo Clemenson quickly silenced her.

Rachel scoffed and stormed off.

Resentment radiated from her, especially toward Evelyn.

Why did Evelyn get to enjoy a luxurious island getaway while they struggled to survive?

All because of her family’s wealth.

No one paid Rachel’s bitterness any mind.

Hugo Rothschild stood at a distance, his dark eyes fixed on Evelyn as she was helped onto the boat. He shot Ethan a cold glare before turning away.

Hot water washed away the seawater clinging to her skin.

Only then did Evelyn fully realize what she had done.

She had jumped into the ocean without hesitation—to save Ethan.

Turns out, he was just practicing breath-holding exercises.

To make things worse, she had been cradled in his arms in front of everyone.

The image of them sharing a blanket refused to leave her mind.

Her cheeks suddenly burned.

Her heartbeat raced uncontrollably.

She pressed a hand to her chest. "Am I running a fever?"

The water had been freezing.

She quickly dried her hair and slipped under the covers.

Maybe sleep would fix it.
###Chapter 406

Ethan Sullivan stood under the shower, letting the warm water cascade over his body.

The image of Evelyn Laurent clinging to him replayed in his mind.

Her slender arms had encircled his waist, the faint fragrance of her hair lingering in the air.

He abruptly turned off the faucet. Water droplets slid from his damp hair.

Taking a deep breath, he grabbed a towel and roughly dried his hair.

The mirror reflected his slightly flushed earlobes.

This unexpected encounter confirmed one thing—Evelyn was different to him.

Ethan lay on the bed, facing the wall.

His fingertips lightly traced the rough wooden surface.

Just beyond this partition was Evelyn's bed.

The realization made his pulse quicken.

One day, this barrier would be broken.

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Evelyn rubbed her eyes and stretched, refreshed.

Oblivious to last night's incident, she yawned as usual.

When she opened her door, Ethan emerged from the adjacent room at the same moment.

"Morning," Ethan greeted with his usual composure.

"Morning," Evelyn smiled back.

Both silently agreed not to mention what had happened.

The scent of cooking drifted from the beach camp.

Julian Langley waved a ladle. "Evelyn! The fish stew is ready!"

She hurried over and accepted the steaming bowl.

The savory aroma dispelled the morning chill.

Her eyes crinkled with satisfaction as she glanced at the materials piled nearby.

"Let's finish the deck chairs today."

The live stream began on schedule, viewers flooding in instantly.

[Finally!]

[What's today's project? So excited!]

Evelyn efficiently sorted the lumber.

Julian blinked in confusion. "Is there a difference between these planks?"

She answered with an enigmatic smile, deftly selecting suitable pieces.

The rasp of sawing soon echoed across the shore.
###Chapter 407

Sunlight filtered through palm fronds, casting dappled shadows on the sand.

Evelyn Laurent's slender fingers moved deftly over wooden blocks, each mortise and tenon joint fitting seamlessly.

A soft click sounded.

The final piece slid perfectly into place.

A rustic deck chair took shape before their eyes.

[Damn! That craftsmanship is insane!]

[My grandpa was a carpenter—this level of skill takes at least twenty years to master.]

[What kind of goddess is Evelyn?]

The live stream exploded with comments.

Julian Langley's jaw nearly hit the ground.

"Evelyn, don't tell me you can build houses too?"

She brushed wood dust from her hands, lips quirking.

"A little."

Ethan Sullivan handed her a coconut, admiration gleaming in his eyes.

"A little? That was master-level work."

Bianca Fairchild leaned in for a closer look—

When frantic footsteps suddenly pounded toward them.

"Help!"

Beatrice Quincy stumbled into camp, disheveled.

Her dress was torn by thorns, face pale with terror.

"Bianca! Save Xander!"

Bianca shot to her feet.

"What happened?"

Beatrice gripped her sister's arm, nails digging in.

"We—we were at the north slope—"

A violent cough wracked her body.

Evelyn was at her side in an instant, steadying her trembling shoulders.

"Breathe. Get to the point."

The icy command made Beatrice flinch.

"Liam fell off the cliff. Xander and the others went after him, but—"

Her eyes rolled back as she collapsed.

Silence swallowed the beach.

Ethan checked her pulse.

"Shock-induced fainting. She'll be out for a while."

Julian grabbed his pack, ready to bolt.

"I'm going after them."

"Stop."

Evelyn's voice cut like steel.

Her gaze narrowed toward the shadowed northern woods.

"Something's wrong."

Bianca stamped her foot.

"But Xander—"

Evelyn was already tying up her hair, machete in hand.

"Ethan, stay with her."

She turned to Julian.

"Let's move."

They vanished into the tree line.

The live chat held its breath.

[This is bad.]

[Isn't the north slope off-limits?]

[Where's the production crew?]

Deep in the jungle, Evelyn halted.

"Wait."

She crouched, fingertips grazing a leaf.

Dull red stains glared against the sunlight.

Julian inhaled sharply.

"That's not—"

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial.

"Not from an accidental injury."

She stood slowly, grip tightening on the machete.

"Someone smeared this here on purpose."
###Chapter 408

The rain poured down in torrents, each drop stinging like pebbles against the skin.

Evelyn Laurent yanked the raincoat over her shoulders with practiced efficiency.

"Move!"

Her voice was ice, her gaze unflinching.

Beatrice Quincy's eyes were red-rimmed with panic. "It's that mountain ahead!" she cried, voice cracking.

Chaos engulfed the production crew. Drones retreated as live feeds blinked out one by one.

"Safety first, everyone!"

Timothy Gold's shout dissolved into thunder.

The mountain path had become a mudslide.

Beatrice slipped, knees slamming against jagged rock. She gritted her teeth and kept leading.

"Here!"

Her trembling finger pointed toward the cliff's edge.

Shattered vines littered the ground. Fresh scrape marks scarred the rock face.

"Xander Quincy! Liam Croix!"

Ethan Sullivan's call vanished into the howling wind.

The rescue team secured ropes with military precision.

Evelyn inspected her gear, eyes sharp as honed steel.

"I'm going with you."

Bianca Fairchild gripped her arm, rainwater dripping from his jawline.

Evelyn shook her head. "We'll cover more ground separately."

She clipped the carabiner and stepped into the void without hesitation.

Rain blurred her vision.

One hand gripping the cliffside, she searched through the deluge.

"Watch your footing!"

Ethan's warning crackled through the radio.

Her boot slipped.

Fingers locked onto an outcrop at the last second.

Blood mixed with rainwater from her torn palm.

"Fine."

The single word transmitted before she descended further.

Dense foliage swallowed the cliff base. Visibility dropped to zero.

Evelyn squinted. A flash of orange pierced the gloom.

"Found them!"

Her voice cut through the storm.
###Chapter 409

The rain poured in torrents as violent winds howled.

Timothy Gold paced frantically along the cliff's edge, veins bulging on his forehead. His fists clenched so tightly his nails dug deep into his palms.

Beatrice Quincy collapsed in the muddy ground, tears mingling with the rain as they streamed down her face. Her gaze remained fixed on the abyss below, lips trembling wordlessly.

On the deck of the Southern Cross, Julian Langley slammed his fist against the railing. He tried multiple times to rush to the rescue, only to be restrained by the crew.

"Let me go! That's my sister!" His furious roar was swallowed by the storm.

The live stream's danmu exploded with messages:

[This weather is terrifying! Please stay safe!]

[I cried when Evelyn Laurent rushed out—Ethan Sullivan chasing after her was so heroic!]

[Bianca Fairchild ran so fast she lost her shoes—now that's true sibling devotion!]

Victoria Langley stood by the window, hands balled into fists. Rain lashed against the glass like the frantic pounding of her heart.

"God, please..." she whispered, eyes locked on the distant cliffs.

Below the precipice, Evelyn Laurent's raincoat tore against jagged branches. Wiping rainwater from her face, she pressed forward in her search.

"Split up!" Ethan Sullivan called to her. "Stay alert!"

Evelyn nodded before disappearing into another thicket. Her flashlight beam flickered weakly through the downpour.

Bianca Fairchild was the first to reach the ravine's base. Muddy water already swallowed her ankles, each step a struggle.

"Xander Quincy!" Her shout was drowned by thunder.

Then—she spotted claw marks on the rockface. Following the trail, her eyes landed on the faint outline of a pitch-black cave.

Her pulse spiked. Stumbling forward, she ran toward the cavern, rain dripping from her hair.

Was someone inside?

Hands shaking, she raised her flashlight. The beam pierced the darkness...
###Chapter 410

The beam of a tactical flashlight sliced through the darkness as Bianca Fairchild burst into the cave.

Two familiar voices rang out in the gloom.

"Someone's here!"

"I knew the production crew wouldn't abandon us!"

The voices of Liam and Lucas Croix instantly eased her strained nerves.

Rounding the corner, she found the mud-caked brothers struggling to their feet.

A motionless figure lay at the cave's center.

Bianca's blood turned to ice when she recognized the deathly pale face.

"Xander!"

She stumbled forward.

Xander Quincy's eyes remained closed, his right leg caked with blood. Worse still, a broken tree branch protruded from his side.

Liam's voice shook. "He saved us..."

Her fingers trembled as she fired the emergency flare.

The crimson streak pierced the curtain of rain.

She stared at the embedded branch, not daring to touch it. Blood still seeped out, staining the muddy ground.

The rescue team arrived with impressive speed.

Ethan Sullivan and Evelyn Laurent rushed into the cave, both freezing at the horrific scene.

A stretcher descended slowly from the cliff above.

Medics secured Xander with practiced gentleness, every movement measured and careful.

As the stretcher began ascending, Bianca grabbed the rope. "I'm going up with him!"

"Negative!" The team leader barked. "You'll endanger the patient!"

Helpless, she watched her brother rise toward the precipice.

Through the downpour, Bianca staggered down the mountain. Branches tore through her raincoat, leaving bloody scratches she barely noticed.

Evelyn frowned at the distraught figure disappearing into the storm.

When the surgical lights flickered on aboard the Southern Cross, Bianca finally collapsed onto the deck.

She stared at her mud-and-blood-streaked hands before burying her face in them.

Ethan stood silent at the corridor's end.

The operating room doors burst open. A nurse rushed out. "We need more plasma!"

Bianca's head snapped up, her face paler than the patient's.
###Chapter 411 

Evelyn Laurent crouched down, her fingertips brushing against Bianca Fairchild's icy wrist.

"Don't be afraid."

Her voice was soft yet carried undeniable strength.

Bianca's unfocused gaze gradually sharpened, her lips curving into a strained smile.

"Mmm..."

She looked down at her tightly clasped hands, her knuckles turning white.

The infirmary reeked of antiseptic.

Liam and Lucas Croix sat in the corner as medical staff bandaged their wounds. Through the layers of gauze, their eyes kept darting toward the closed operating room door.

The production crew had issued an emergency broadcast suspension.

The hurricane had devastated nearly every structure on the island. Beatrice Quincy's wooden cabin had collapsed, while Rachel Clemenson and Crystal Rothschild's tent had vanished without a trace.

Only Evelyn's group's small cabin remained standing amidst the storm.

Online discussions had exploded into chaos.

At the Quincy mansion, Mr. and Mrs. Quincy's faces paled when they received the news.

"Is Beatrice alright?"

That was their first question.

Only after confirming their daughter's safety did they remember to ask about their son's condition.

Beatrice paced outside the operating room.

"Timothy Gold!" Her voice suddenly rose. "My brother is critically injured, and you're just letting him die here?"

Timothy shot her a cold glance.

"The medical facilities on the yacht are more advanced than the mainland hospitals." His tone simmered with suppressed anger. "Do you want everyone to die by setting sail now?"

Beatrice was left speechless.

She glared at Timothy's retreating back, her nails digging deep into her palms.

When her gaze shifted to Bianca in the corner, a flash of venom crossed her eyes.

This jinx!

The operating room doors suddenly swung open.

Bianca sprang to her feet, her soaked hem dragging a wet trail across the floor.

"Doctor!"

Her voice trembled as if grasping at her last lifeline.

Beatrice also hurried forward, water droplets from her hair splattering onto the sterile floor.

Both women remained in their post-drowning disarray, neither having changed out of their wet clothes.
###Chapter 412

Bianca Fairchild stood drenched at the infirmary doorway, her hair dripping. Her face was paler than Xander Quincy's on the hospital bed.

"The branch penetrated about three centimeters. Fractured left tibia. Cracked third and fourth ribs on the right side." The doctor removed his mask. "Multiple soft tissue contusions. Immediate evacuation is recommended."

At the words "no life-threatening injuries," Bianca's legs buckled. She nearly collapsed.

Liam and Lucas Croix stood in the corner. Though only lightly injured, they hung their heads like guilty children. Xander had shielded them with his body during the tumble down the slope.

Timothy Gold and Eugene York crouched at the end of the hallway. The two grown men clutched their hair like drowned rats. The yacht rocked with the waves as rain lashed against the windows.

"Did you release the statement?" Timothy's voice was hoarse.

Eugene stared at his phone screen. "Sent. Said we'll evacuate once the weather clears." He locked the screen abruptly. "The internet must be exploding right now."

Inside the infirmary, the monitor beeped steadily. Evelyn Laurent stood by the bed, gazing at Xander's bandaged body.

"Evie!" Julian Langley burst in and grabbed her wrist. "Are you okay?"

Evelyn shook her head, her eyes fixed on Bianca. The usually poised woman now gripped the bed rail with white-knuckled intensity.

Ethan Sullivan appeared at the doorway, idly shuffling a deck of cards. "Anyone up for poker?"

"Poker?" Evelyn blinked in confusion.

Julian perked up immediately. "It's a three-player card game!" He leaned closer to Evelyn's ear. "We'll make Ethan lose his shirt."

A flash of lightning illuminated Ethan's smirk. "Ten grand a hand. You in?"

The yacht lurched violently with another wave, scattering the cards across the floor. The survival challenge on this storm-wracked island had proven far deadlier than any of them imagined.
###Chapter 413

Ethan Sullivan's lips curved with an elusive smile as his gaze lingered on Julian Langley's face. "Third brother, made up your mind?"

His light tone sent a chill down Julian's spine.

Memories of their past poker games flashed through his mind—how he'd always lost spectacularly.

"Of course!" Julian lifted his chin with confidence.

This was Evelyn's first time playing. His odds were excellent.

Besides, would Ethan dare keep winning against him? If so, Julian would make sure Evelyn saw right through him.

Before dealing, Julian shot Ethan a warning glare.

Ethan was far too sharp.

Having known the Langley brothers for years, he recognized that threatening look instantly.

He sighed inwardly.

Third brother...

This time, I really can't save your wallet.

But losing to Evelyn? You won't mind, will you?

Lowering his lashes to hide his amusement, Ethan began dealing the cards.

Though Evelyn Laurent had never played poker before, her expression shifted the moment she picked up her hand.

Her focus locked onto the cards.

The first round was just a warm-up.

As expected, Evelyn lost.

Julian grinned triumphantly.

If even he could win, his luck must be phenomenal today. Clearly, Evelyn was a novice, and Ethan was going easy on her.

But by the end of the second round, his smile froze.

Then the third... the fourth...

Julian grew quieter with each game.

Evelyn had only needed one round to grasp the rules.

From the second game onward, she dominated effortlessly.

Her brilliance was undeniable—photographic memory, flawless calculations.

She anticipated every move with uncanny precision.

After over a dozen consecutive losses, Julian was on the verge of collapse.

It made no sense.

How could Evelyn be this good?

Just like when their sixth brother had introduced them to gaming—she'd mastered the controls in one round before annihilating them all.

Now history repeated itself.

Evelyn was unstoppable.

Finally, Julian understood Ethan's earlier remark.

It had been a warning that he'd inevitably lose to Evelyn.

But losing to his little sister?

He didn't mind at all.

With that realization, Julian's laughter returned, bright and carefree.

Though truthfully, Ethan suffered the heaviest losses.

Time flew by in their joyous match.

When the game concluded, Evelyn stretched lazily, reluctant for it to end.

Her winnings totaled three million.

Ethan had lost two million.

Julian trailed behind with one million in losses.
###Chapter 414

"Evelyn, you're amazing!" Julian Langley's eyes sparkled. "Winning so many rounds on your first try!"

He couldn't be prouder of his little sister.

The more brilliant she was, the less likely she'd be interested in that Ethan Sullivan.

Evelyn Laurent shook her head slightly, her gaze lingering meaningfully on Ethan. "Third Brother, Ethan was going easy on us."

She'd seen through his strategy.

Several times, he could've won but deliberately held back.

Since he seemed to be enjoying himself, she hadn't called him out—until now.

Julian's face fell instantly.

"You two..." He sighed dramatically. "You're not even human!"

Outsmarted at every turn.

Evelyn laughed softly. "Don't be upset, Third Brother. I'll have Ethan transfer all the winnings to you."

"No!" Julian waved his hands frantically. "You earned that fair and square."

Ethan watched Evelyn with tender warmth.

Every moment with her felt like a dream.

As dusk settled, the storm finally ceased.

The post-rain air was crisp and refreshing.

Evelyn hopped off the yacht eagerly.

"Solid ground feels so much better," she breathed deeply.

The constant swaying had been unsettling.

Ethan followed close behind, chuckling. "Agreed."

Suddenly, Evelyn frowned, her sharp eyes darting toward the far side of the island.

"Do you hear that?" she whispered.

Ethan tensed. "Engine sounds."

Their eyes met in silent understanding.

Ethan spun toward the yacht.

Evelyn vanished into the dense foliage like a shadow.

"Code red!" Ethan pounded on Timothy Gold's door. "Initiate evacuation. Launch the drone feed!"

Without waiting for a response, he sprinted after Evelyn.

Timothy complied immediately, though confused.

When the drone footage appeared, he gasped.

On the opposite shore, a fishing boat had docked.

A dozen foreigners scouted the area.

One suddenly raised his weapon.

BANG!

The gunshot shattered the night.
###Chapter 415

Bang—

A muffled sound pierced the night.

The surveillance screen in front of Timothy Gold went black. The drone's signal vanished completely.

The live stream cut off abruptly.

The sudden late-night broadcast of Siblings had already caught viewers off guard.

Yet, a flood of loyal fans had still rushed into the stream.

They witnessed armed personnel boarding the island and the chilling moment the drone was shot down.

[Oh my god! What's happening?]
[These aren't our military!]
[They're armed! Advancing toward the island's center!]
[Wait—is that Evelyn Laurent and Ethan Sullivan? Where are they going?]

The internet erupted instantly.

Timothy's fingers flew across the keyboard.

He immediately dialed the coast guard, reporting the exact coordinates and requesting emergency backup.

The last thing the surveillance feed captured was Evelyn and Ethan disappearing swiftly into the darkness.

"Damn it!"

Timothy slammed his fist on the desk.

Neither of them had taken their earpieces or GPS bracelets when they left the ship.

Now there was no way to contact them.

These were two high-profile guests with special statuses—how could they act recklessly in a crisis?

A cold sweat broke out on Timothy's forehead.

All he could do was pray they returned safely.

Then—

On the surveillance feed, Evelyn suddenly looked up.

Her icy gaze pierced through the lens. "Fall back. Don't get in the way."

Timothy froze.

In the way?

She was telling the entire production crew to evacuate?

But with the situation escalating, he didn't have time to overthink it.

An unnatural sound came from the shoreline.

He whipped around.

Two rubber boats had landed silently.

Four armed figures stepped onto the island, their gun barrels glinting coldly under the moonlight.

"Everyone, assemble now! Armed intruders on the island!"

Timothy's voice trembled over the broadcast.

Rachel Clemenson scoffed. "What script is this now?"

Leo Clemenson lounged on the couch. "Just special effects. I'm not falling for it."

The other guests gathered one by one.

Only Bianca Fairchild remained by Xander Quincy's side as he lay unconscious.

Through the window, she spotted shadowy figures approaching and tightened her grip on the medical scissors.

Julian Langley burst into the room first.

"Where's Evelyn?"

His gaze swept over the crowd—then his face drained of color.
###Chapter 416

Timothy Gold stared at the drone footage, his fingers trembling slightly.

"She told us to retreat, but now it's too late."

Julian Langley leaned closer to the screen, his pupils constricting sharply.

Evelyn Laurent's figure appeared unmistakably on the isolated island!

Even more alarming were the armed shadows scattered through the dense forest—far more than anticipated.

Ethan Sullivan and Evelyn moved swiftly under the cover of darkness, weaving through thick vegetation. Their agile movements made it clear they were tracking these intruders.

"They're investigating who these people are," Timothy murmured.

Before he could finish, rough shouts erupted from the deck.

"Everyone on board, come out now!"

The heavily accented command was followed by four dark figures boarding the yacht, kicking open cabin doors one by one.

With a loud crash, Rachel Clemenson's door was violently forced open.

"What the hell is going on? Has the production crew lost their minds?" Rachel rubbed her eyes, cursing loudly.

Her voice cut off abruptly.

Four gleaming weapons were pointed directly at her chest.

The lead brute licked his lips. "Tender meat. Delicious."

Rachel's legs gave out, and she collapsed to the floor.

The scene spread across the live stream, sending the chat into chaos.

[Oh God! Pirates!]

[Call the police! Send coordinates!]

[They have guns! Someone help them!]

Rachel trembled violently, forcing a smile more pitiful than a sob. "I—I don't taste good..."

Timothy slammed his fist onto the console. "Those idiots!"

He watched helplessly as Rachel and her brother were roughly bound and dragged out like cargo.

"Don't kill me! I have money! Lots of it!" Rachel shrieked hysterically.

A sharp slap silenced her instantly.

Three pirates stayed behind to guard the hostages while the others began systematically searching the yacht.

"Come out on your own," a hoarse threat echoed through the hallway. "Hand over your valuables, and we'll spare your lives."

Cold metal glinted ominously under the moonlight.
###Chapter 417

"What? They want us to pay?" Julian Langley slammed the table, his eyes flashing with fury.

He tore open his collar, revealing well-defined arm muscles.

"Who the hell do they think they are?"

Timothy Gold quickly grabbed his shoulder. "Julian, calm down!"

Julian scoffed and shook him off. "Sixty people scared of three lowlifes? They wouldn’t dare shoot."

Hugo Rothschild adjusted his cuffs with deliberate calm. "Julian’s right."

His sharp gaze lifted. "We’re not lambs for slaughter."

The cruise corridor echoed with the pirates' taunts.

Julian cracked his knuckles.

"Damn it!"

He flung open the cabin door and lunged at the armed pirate like a panther.

Hugo followed with a swift side kick to the gut.

"Ah—!"

The pirate collapsed, his gun skidding across the floor.

Julian snatched it up—then froze.

"It’s real!"

Before the other two pirates could react, the crew swarmed and pinned them down.

On deck, the remaining pirate paled.

He yanked Rachel Clemenson against him, pressing a knife to her throat.

"Don’t move!" he snarled. "One step closer, and I slit her neck!"

Rachel trembled, tears streaming.

"P-please... help..."

Regret twisted her insides.

Why had she opened that door?

Why had she doubted the crew’s warnings?

Now she’d dragged herself and her brother into the lion’s den.

The pirate’s blade glinted coldly.

"Back off!" he barked. "Or she dies now!"

Julian’s fists clenched white.

Hugo’s eyes narrowed to slits.

Everyone stood paralyzed.

The salty wind carried Rachel’s desperate sobs into the void.
###Chapter 418

The flare split the night sky. Evelyn Laurent's pupils contracted sharply.

"They have reinforcements."

Her fingers whitened around the dagger's hilt.

Ethan Sullivan lay motionless in the bushes beside her, his breathing barely audible. "At least three squads incoming."

The sea breeze carried salt and decay through the palm fronds.

Evelyn squinted. Shadows darted behind distant boulders—too fluid, too practiced. These weren't amateurs.

"Not regular pirates," she whispered. "Their formations are military-grade."

Moonlight carved Ethan's profile into something glacial.

"Black Sharks." The name dropped like shrapnel. "Southeast Asia's most vicious syndicate. Hijacked a merchant vessel last year."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. She remembered last month's news—a vanished cargo ship, thirty crewmen still missing.

"So they're after—"

"This island's strategic position." Ethan cut her off. "It commands the shipping lane."

Crunching shells.

Both froze.

A scar-faced mercenary passed five meters away, assault rifle sweeping. The infrared dot danced across tree trunks like a malevolent firefly.

Evelyn's muscles coiled.

"Hold." Ethan's breath grazed her ear. "He's probing."

As predicted, the mercenary spun and fired three rounds into the shrubs. Bullets grazed Evelyn's hair, scorching the air.

"Two hundred meters southeast—sniper." Ethan's voice was Arctic calm. "On three, roll to nine o'clock."

Copper flooded Evelyn's mouth. She'd bitten through her lip.

"One."

Boots advanced.

"Two."

A scope glinted in the palms.

"Three!"

Evelyn exploded forward as a suppressed shot spat past. Her former cover sprouted a smoking hole.

Ethan vanished.

The mercenary gurgled—a crimson line opened across his throat. As he collapsed, Evelyn glimpsed Ethan's silhouette slicing through moonlight like a specter.

The boardroom strategist moved with Special Forces lethality.

Shrill whistles pierced the night. More footfalls converged.

Evelyn pressed against boulders, her palms slick. This wasn't chance—it was a coordinated assault.

Her satellite phone glowed: NO SIGNAL.

"Jammed." Ethan reappeared, his tactical gear dark with blood. "They brought disruptors."

Evelyn seized his wrist.

"Who are you really?"

Moonlight caught his smile—gentle as a knife's edge. He pressed something cold into her hand.

A dragon insignia.

Her breath stalled.

She knew this emblem. The Navy's most elite unit: Leviathan.

"That shipwreck three years ago." Ethan's whisper carried the weight of torpedoes. "Was no accident."

Explosions rocked the island's far side. In the firestorm's glow, Evelyn saw the predator in Ethan's eyes.

"Now," he racked the rifle's slide, "let's educate these vermin on territorial sovereignty."
###Chapter 419

The flare tore through the night sky.

A dozen shadowy figures darted toward the crimson glow like phantoms.

Ethan Sullivan and Evelyn Laurent exchanged a glance.

They sprinted in unison toward the same direction.

On the deck of the Southern Cross, Julian Langley had three pirates bound tightly.

Inside the cabin, the last remaining assailant pressed a knife against Rachel and Leo Clemenson's throats.

The two sides faced off across the staircase.

The pirate snarled, flecks of spit flying from his mouth.

Julian rolled up his sleeves, shedding his Oscar-winning actor persona.

He unleashed a stream of expletives with perfect enunciation.

Beatrice Quincy's eyes widened.

She never imagined the refined Julian could swear with such vigor.

Timothy Gold stomped his foot in frustration. "Mind the live stream! Have some decorum!"

The crew brandished baseball bats and metal pipes, shoving the three captives forward as human shields.

Suddenly, the pirates dragged the Clemenson siblings to the bow.

The cold barrel of a gun pressed against their temples.

"Release them!" The lead pirate barked in broken English. "Or there will be blood!"

Julian sneered. "You dare cause trouble in these waters? Who gave you the audacity?"

Hugo Rothschild stepped forward, speaking fluent Filipino.

Julian turned to him, bewildered. "What did he say?"

"Tell them we're live." Hugo narrowed his eyes. "The entire nation is watching."

The pirate leader's face paled. His gun trembled slightly.

The whirring of drones pierced through the ocean breeze.

The red dots of camera lenses flickered in the darkness.
###Chapter 420

The salty sea wind whipped across the deck, thickening the air with tension.

Hugo Rothschild's words hung unfinished as the pirates' faces darkened.

Grimacing expressions twisted their sun-baked features, flashing jagged teeth as they whispered among themselves.

Julian Langley's knuckles whitened around his weapon.

Every passenger aboard the luxury yacht stood frozen.

The pirates erupted in shrill laughter.

Their scar-faced leader barked in broken English: "Hand her over or we sink this ship!"

Rachel Clemenson was dragged roughly to the railing, moonlight glinting off the blade at her throat.

Crimson beads welled against her pale neck.

Hugo shoved his captive forward, pressing his combat knife against the man's windpipe.

"Try me." His voice cut colder than the ocean breeze. "Let's see who bleeds first."

The pirate captain's eyes gleamed with malice.

Suddenly, searchlights pierced the distant waves.

"Our reinforcements!" The pirates cheered, waving their weapons.

Timothy Gold snapped orders: "Full speed ahead!"

Engines roared through the night.

Panic seized the pirates. "They're actually running!"

"I thought these people valued loyalty above all!"

Leo Clemenson collapsed to his knees, despair etching his face.

The Southern Cross loomed against the moon like a sleek leviathan.

The pirates' greedy eyes clung to the yacht's polished hull.

"Don't let them escape!" The scarred leader fired a flare gun.

A red streak split the sky.

Distant lights accelerated toward them.

Hugo narrowed his eyes. "Battle stations."

Hearts pounded in unison.

Tonight would drown in blood.
###Chapter 421

The Southern Cross's engines rumbled low and deep.

The luxury liner slowly pulled away from the dock.

The pirates ignored this, continuing their frenzied climb onto the ship.

Silent signals passed through the air.

Shadows lurking in the darkness slipped into the water, swimming toward the vessel like predatory fish.

"Stop that ship!"

Someone hissed the command.

The massive Southern Cross began turning in the water.

Even at full throttle, the colossal ship needed time to accelerate.

Timothy Gold gripped the railing.

He regretted not abandoning the Clemenson siblings sooner.

But it was too late for regrets now.

The sound of chaotic footsteps echoed across the deck.

The pirates had boarded.

Evelyn Laurent narrowed her eyes.

She and Ethan Sullivan hid in the shadows, observing the unfolding chaos.

"Something's wrong," Ethan murmured. "They're too organized."

The pirates moved with trained precision, fanning out strategically.

Some seized the bridge while others secured the deck.

The production crew retreated under the onslaught.

Blood began spreading across the wooden planks.

Evelyn dug her nails into her palms.

This was her ship.

Her island.

Now overrun by these lawless invaders.

"Don't act rashly." Ethan pressed a firm hand on her shoulder. "We'll split up."

He pointed toward the distance. "I'll draw them away."

"You take the boat."

Evelyn nodded.

Ethan suddenly burst from cover.

He shouted in Filipino dialect: "Someone escaped into the jungle!"

His voice carried sharply on the sea wind.

A dozen pirates immediately changed course.

The battle aboard the ship was nearing its end.

The production team had been forced into a corner.

The pirate leader waved a gun, counting captives.

Evelyn slipped silently into the water.

Icy ocean enveloped her.

The Southern Cross's shadow loomed overhead.

Like a shark, she glided toward her prey.
###Chapter 422

The pirates grinned maliciously as they knocked the production crew to the ground. Only Julian Langley and Hugo Rothschild remained standing back-to-back, barely holding their ground.

Blood splattered across the cruise ship's cockpit windows.

The pirate leader puffed on a cigar, smugly dispatching half his men to chase Ethan Sullivan.

Only five guards remained on deck.

Hidden in the shadows, Evelyn Laurent narrowed her eyes.

She moved like a panther poised to strike, silent and lethal in the darkness.

The baseball bat sliced through the air.

The first pirate crumpled with a grunt.

The second barely turned before a kick shattered his kneecap.

The third didn't even reach for his gun.

In under three minutes, the deck fell silent again.

Evelyn shook out her tingling wrist and vaulted over the railing.

She hauled Rachel and Leo Clemenson onto the deck like stray kittens.

"Set sail!"

Without looking back, she sprinted toward the jungle.

Julian lunged for the railing, eyes wild, but Timothy Gold gripped his shoulder like a vise.

"You'll get her killed!"

The cruise ship's engines roared to life.

The trussed-up pirates stared in horror.

Crystal Rothschild suddenly screamed, "Where's my brother?"

Ripples spread across the water.

Hugo was swimming desperately toward shore.

Timothy slammed his fist against the bulkhead. "That lunatic!"

Deep in the jungle,

Hugo wiped seawater from his face.

His fingers tightened around the combat knife stolen from a pirate.

This time, he wouldn't let her face danger alone.
###Chapter 423

Julian Langley's face darkened like a thundercloud.

His knuckles turned white as he clenched his fists, staring in the direction where Hugo Rothschild had disappeared.

That arrogant fool had to cause trouble at the worst possible moment.

Timothy Gold and the crew were organizing the evacuation, returning the guests' confiscated phones.

The moment Julian powered on his device, dozens of missed call notifications flooded the screen.

Before he could even process them, Victoria Langley's call came through.

"Julian!"

Her scream was so piercing he had to hold the phone away to protect his eardrums.

"What kind of brother are you? Letting Evelyn walk straight into danger?"

Victoria's voice cracked with barely restrained sobs.

She knew she shouldn't take it out on her son, but she needed an outlet for her terror.

"Mom, Evelyn knows what she's doing," he said softly. "The military's en route. Me going ashore now would only complicate things."

Muffled weeping filtered through the receiver.

Victoria couldn't erase the images of armed pirates from her mind.

Though the drone footage had been shaky, she'd seen her daughter take down those criminals with lethal precision.

But bullets don't discriminate.

Ethan Sullivan and his team had vanished from the cameras—their fate unknown.

The drones now hid in the treetops, their lenses trembling, one stray shot away from destruction.

"Trust her, Mom." Julian's voice strained. "Ethan and Evelyn will make it back alive."

His fists trembled with suppressed rage.

They were up against ruthless pirates. Three against an army.

And one of those three was dead weight.

But he couldn't voice that thought.

As Richard Langley murmured reassurances, Victoria finally steadied her breathing.

"Whoever dared threaten my daughter on that island," she said, wiping her tears with surgical precision, "will pay in blood."

Each syllable dripped with glacial fury.
###Chapter 424

Victoria Langley's fingers dug into Richard Langley's wrist like talons. "Alert all maritime forces immediately," her voice was glacial. "Shoot those pirates on sight."

Richard stroked his wife's rigid back, his eyes glinting with cold fury. "It's already handled."

Those fools had dared to target his daughter.

The Langley maritime network sprang into action. Within half an hour, the dossier on the "Muller Pirate Crew" lay on Richard's desk.

"Old acquaintances," Richard sneered, dialing a series of encrypted numbers.

Meanwhile, Alexander Langley's global communications network activated. Every vessel with ties to the Muller pirates received an ultimatum—sever all ties immediately or face the Langley Group's full retaliation.

The tides had turned at sea.

Evelyn Laurent remained oblivious.

She moved through the dense jungle like a panther, the briny wind laced with gunpowder stinging her face. Without comms, she relied on primal tracking skills to find Ethan Sullivan.

In the distance, boat engines roared. Reinforcements were closing in.

At least the Southern Cross had escaped the danger zone. Evelyn exhaled slightly—now only she and Ethan remained as targets, simplifying her mission.

Bushes rustled ahead. Evelyn dropped low, holding her breath.

Six pirates shoved through the foliage, cursing, their weapons glinting in the sunlight. Frustration made them sloppy.

Evelyn's sharp eyes cataloged their arsenal: two assault rifles, four handguns. Her lips curved as her fingers brushed the combat knife at her waist.

The prey had walked into her trap.
###Chapter 425

The moonlight vanished behind thick clouds, plunging the island into darkness.

Evelyn Laurent crouched low in the underbrush, her fingers parting the leaves before her. Six pirates patrolled ahead, their flashlight beams cutting through the trees.

She picked up a fist-sized rock, testing its weight in her palm.

Whoosh—

The stone sliced through the night air, landing twenty meters away in a dense thicket.

"What was that?"

The pirates snapped to attention, their flashlights converging on the source of the sound.

In that split second of distraction, Evelyn moved like a shadow. Her steps were featherlight, barely disturbing the earth beneath her.

Crack! Crack!

Two precise strikes to the back of their necks sent two pirates crumpling to the ground.

The remaining four whirled around—just in time to see a blur of motion.

Thud!

Her sweeping kick took them all down in one fluid motion. Before they could react, four brutal punches found their temples with unerring accuracy.

Six pirates lay unconscious. The entire fight had taken less than fifteen seconds.

Evelyn swiftly stripped them of their belts, binding each man to the nearest tree trunk. As she searched their gear, her fingers brushed cold metal.

Two standard-issue pistols.

She ejected the magazines with practiced ease, confirming they were loaded. One pistol spun in her grip before she snapped its barrel with a sharp twist.

Snap!

The broken weapon clattered to the ground.

The other pistol found its place at her hip. Her gaze lingered on a flare gun, her lips curling into a smirk.

After setting several crude traps around the area, she pulled the flare's trigger without hesitation.

Hiss—

A crimson streak tore through the black sky, blazing like a beacon over the island.

Evelyn melted back into the foliage, a panther awaiting her prey. That flare would draw more pirates—and signal her location to Ethan Sullivan.

On the distant horizon, the Southern Cross had vanished from sight.

Now, this island was her hunting ground.
###Chapter 426

The moon vanished behind dark clouds, plunging the island into perilous darkness.

Evelyn Laurent stood in the shadows, her fingers tracing the razor-sharp edge of her combat knife. Her gaze was colder than steel, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

Only two drones from the production crew remained, silently circling the night sky. One captured Evelyn's figure—poised like a panther ready to strike.

The live stream erupted.

[Damn! Evelyn just pulled off that move like a boss!]
[She snapped a gun bare-handed? What kind of superhuman strength is that?!]
[When are the military reinforcements arriving? I'm losing my mind here!]
[Go, Evelyn! Stay safe!]

Comments flooded the screen as viewership soared past ten million. Countless fans stayed up, glued to the edge-of-the-seat broadcast.

Deep in the jungle, Ethan Sullivan moved like a ghost. He'd effortlessly shaken off his pursuers—the pirates were mere clowns in his eyes.

He followed the signal flare's trajectory, then froze.

Ahead lay an intricate web of traps—sharpened stakes, hidden snares, pits lined with spikes. A flicker of admiration crossed Ethan's eyes.

A soft snap.

Evelyn whirled around, her gaze sharp as lightning. Among the shadows, Ethan's figure flickered into view.

Their eyes locked in silent understanding. Evelyn flashed a series of hand signals. Ethan instantly deciphered them, maneuvering along the safe path toward her.

"Are you hurt?" Ethan's voice was low as his eyes scanned her for injuries.

"Piece of cake." Evelyn smirked. "You?"

Ethan shook his head. "Muller Pirates? Pathetic."

At the name, Evelyn's eyes turned glacial. The notorious pirate group had blood on their hands—innocent lives lost to their cruelty.

"If they're here," Evelyn twirled her knife with lethal grace, "they won't leave alive."

Ethan bared a bloodthirsty grin. "My thoughts exactly."

A sudden gust rustled the leaves. Sharing one last glance, they melted into the shadows.

The hunt had begun.
###Chapter 427

Ethan Sullivan immediately sensed the icy aura radiating from Evelyn Laurent.

A faint smirk curved his lips.

These pirates had no idea who they were dealing with.

Evelyn never forgot a grudge.

She despised anyone who dared cross her—yet these fools...

They had the audacity to rob her openly, even demanding her beloved Southern Cross.

That ship was her pride and joy.

It was like thieves breaking into your home and declaring it theirs.

Evelyn wouldn't tolerate such insolence.

"Eighteen of them, split into three search teams. The other two groups should arrive soon," Ethan said grimly.

He hadn't just been evading capture—he'd memorized their entire strategy.

The rain had stopped, but the island's soil remained damp.

Perfect for masking their tracks.

Both of them were caked in mud.

Even Ethan, who usually abhorred dirt, didn't flinch as it soaked through his clothes.

Evelyn's lips curled coldly. "I hope they come."

But they both knew the pirates' main force still waited aboard the ship.

Before any pirates appeared—

A bloodcurdling scream shattered the silence.

Evelyn whirled around.

In a mud pit a dozen meters away, a figure thrashed wildly.

A sharp wooden spike impaled his arm, blood mixing with the filthy water.

When he wiped the sludge from his face—

Evelyn's pupils contracted violently.

Ethan's expression mirrored her shock.

Their gazes locked, mutual fury flashing between them.

It was Hugo Rothschild.

After the scream, Hugo bit his lip hard, struggling to rise from the mire.

Mud blurred his vision.

He knew he'd walked into a trap.

Hidden in the darkness, the pit had been expertly disguised with leaves.

Sharpened stakes lined the bottom.

Only his quick reflexes had saved him from worse injury.

Blood gushed from his arm.

Now he was immobilized—a perfect target.

"What the hell is he doing here?" Evelyn hissed, eyes glinting with lethal cold.

Hugo should have been safe aboard the Southern Cross.

Instead, he'd recklessly come ashore.

Did he think he could help?

Oh, he'd helped alright.

Helped the enemy by triggering her trap!

As Hugo shifted again, Evelyn snapped, "Move right."
###Chapter 428

Hugo Rothschild's scream pierced the silent rainforest.

Evelyn Laurent whirled around, her sharp gaze cutting through the downpour.

"Freeze!" she barked.

Hugo went rigid. The faint click of a triggered mechanism sounded beneath his feet.

Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. He didn't dare move a muscle.

Ethan Sullivan's eyes turned glacial. His fingers curled around the hilt of his combat knife.

"You followed us?"

Hugo shook his head frantically, rainwater dripping from his hair.

"I came to help—"

His voice faltered under Evelyn's icy stare.

She narrowed her eyes, scanning the trap beneath his boots.

"Help?" A cold laugh escaped her lips. "You mean help the enemy disable our traps?"

Hugo's face flushed crimson.

Though he'd served two years in the military, he now resembled a clumsy recruit.

Ethan had already ghosted behind him.

"Don't move." His low voice carried lethal intent. "One twitch, and you stay here forever."

Hugo swallowed hard, feeling the cold steel against his nape.

Evelyn moved forward and disarmed the trap with swift precision.

"On your knees." She jerked her chin. "Stand up, and I'll break your legs."

Hugo dropped obediently, like a chastened child.

Distant footsteps crunched through the undergrowth.

The pirates had heard his scream and were closing in fast.

Evelyn and Ethan exchanged a glance.

They melted into the shadows like panthers.

Hugo held his breath, watching where they'd vanished.

Seconds later, screams erupted.

"My leg!"
"Traps everywhere!"
"Watch your step!"

Pirates stumbled into hidden mechanisms, falling like dominoes.

Evelyn emerged from behind a tree, driving her elbow into the nearest attacker's throat.

Ethan materialized on the opposite flank, his knife-hand strike dropping another foe.

In under three minutes, six pirates lay unconscious.

Hugo gaped as they efficiently bound the captives.

The sound of belts biting into flesh made his scalp prickle.

Evelyn shook rainwater from her hands and leveled him with a frosty glare.

"Now. Explain why you're here."

Her stare sent chills down his spine.

He knew he needed a damn good answer.

Or he'd be the next one tied to a tree.
###Chapter 429

Hugo Rothschild crouched in the bushes, his fingernails digging deep into his palms.

Evelyn Laurent and Ethan Sullivan moved in perfect sync, vanishing like phantoms into the shadows of the trees.

He clenched his jaw and pressed himself lower against the damp earth.

The wound on his arm burned, but the pain in his chest was worse.

The sharpened wooden stake had been Evelyn's handiwork.

She always played it cool, yet every move was calculated.

Hugo stared at the discarded gun by his feet, his throat tightening.

He knew how to use it.

But right now, it felt impossibly heavy.

Static crackled from a distant walkie-talkie.

Ethan silently mouthed a translation, his profile as cold as ice in the moonlight.

Hugo suddenly realized he was the outsider here.

Six dark figures closed in from different directions.

He watched Evelyn and Ethan leap onto the tree branches, moving as lightly as owls in the night.

While he remained pressed against the muddy ground.

A pirate's boot nearly grazed his nose.

Hugo held his breath.

A whooshing sound came from above.

Evelyn dropped from the tree, her silver hair tracing a moonlit arc.

Her foot struck the pirate's temple, and her hair brushed Hugo's face as she spun.

The scent of blood mingled with crushed leaves.

Ethan took down two men simultaneously, his gun already pressed to the fourth pirate's neck as he landed.

Hugo tightened his grip on the weapon.

The last pirate was backing toward him.

Only one chance.

He lunged forward, slamming the gun's stock into the man's knee.

The pirate collapsed with a scream.

Evelyn turned, surprise flickering in her eyes.

Hugo rose, panting, only to see her gaze shift away.

She walked toward the captive tied to the tree, flipping her dagger between her fingers.

"Time to end this," she said.
###Chapter 430

A dull thud.

The third pirate collapsed to the ground.

Evelyn Laurent retracted her elbow smoothly, her sharp gaze scanning the surroundings.

Ethan Sullivan had already dispatched two enemies with ruthless efficiency.

Hugo Rothschild suddenly lunged forward.

The butt of his pistol slammed into the nearest pirate's temple.

"Thud!"

The pirate crumpled instantly.

"Decent reflexes," Evelyn remarked coolly.

She was already poised to strike again if needed.

The drone's blurry footage captured the scene.

The live stream erupted.

[Sister Evelyn is a total badass!]

[Ethan's moves are insane!]

[Hugo finally woke up!]

Forty minutes had passed since the pirates landed on the island.

In the distance, speedboats approached across the dark water.

Evelyn's brow furrowed.

No one knew when reinforcements would arrive.

But she couldn’t let them reach the island.

She and Ethan might hold their own.

But with Hugo...

This deadweight.

"What now?" Hugo whispered urgently.

Evelyn jerked her chin toward the fallen pirates. "Strip them. Wear their clothes."

Hugo blinked in confusion.

Ethan cut to the chase. "You’ll just slow us down. Blend in with them instead."

"Go play dead over there."

Each word was a knife to the ego.

Hugo's knuckles turned white.

Evelyn twisted the blade. "You are a liability."

Heat flooded Hugo's face.

Mud disguised his flushed skin.

Never in his life had he been so thoroughly dismissed.

Gritting his teeth, he moved toward the pirate’s corpse.

He yanked off the jacket with rough, jerking motions.

Evelyn and Ethan shoved the unconscious pirates into a muddy pit.

Vines bound them tightly.

Hugo crouched under a tree.

A loosely tied rope dangled from his wrist.

He watched the speedboats draw closer.

For the first time, he felt utterly powerless.
###Chapter 431

Hugo Rothschild crouched among the captives, his fingertips brushing against the cold steel of his gun.

Along the coastline, Evelyn Laurent and Ethan Sullivan moved swiftly.

Three pirate ships cut through the waves, their hulls leaving jagged scars on the ocean's surface.

"Blow up their ships?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes as the sea wind tossed her hair.

Ethan tightened his grip on his weapon. "Do it."

He glanced at the woman beside him. "Know how to use this?"

Evelyn checked the magazine with practiced ease, a smirk playing on her lips. "Let's find out."

Ethan quickly explained the key functions.

Evelyn raised the rifle, her scope locking onto a target fifty meters away.

Bang!

The bullet tore through the air.

Ethan fired almost simultaneously.

Both shots struck the hull with deadly precision.

Chaos erupted on the pirate ships.

"Ambush!"

The deck splintered as seawater gushed in.

All three vessels took hits, the pirates scrambling to plug the leaks.

Evelyn scoffed. "They're not hurting enough."

She exchanged a glance with Ethan before they shouldered their weapons in unison.

Two shadows darted into the jungle like panthers.

The pirate ships finally reached shore.

Thirty armed pirates disembarked.

Their leader, a burly man, signaled for the group to fan out.

Their movements were disciplined—clearly trained professionals.

Drones flickered among the treetops.

On the screens, the pirates combed the island inch by inch.

Evelyn lay hidden in the underbrush.

A lone pirate passed right in front of her.

She lunged, her hand striking the back of his neck with surgical precision.

The pirate collapsed without a sound.

On the other side, Ethan materialized like a ghost behind a tree.

Another pirate dropped silently.

The deadly game of cat and mouse had begun.
###Chapter 432 

The flare's glow had barely faded when the pirates spotted their bound comrades beneath the tree.

"Damn it!"

The lead pirate kicked the trunk hard. His men were trussed up like sacrificial lambs—an utter humiliation.

Tension thickened the air.

The pirates fanned out, rifles trained on the surrounding bushes. They were certain more of Evelyn's people remained on the island.

"At least thirty," one pirate muttered.

As they cut their comrades loose, they noticed the dazed expressions. One man vomited upon waking—clear signs of blunt force trauma.

"What the hell happened?" A newcomer grabbed a captive by the collar.

"Evelyn's people...know martial arts..." The man's gaze was unfocused. "Everything went black before I could react..."

Hugo Rothschild blended into the group, his face smeared with mud. He listened to the pirates cursing in Filipino while scanning the area.

His eyes lingered on the dense foliage.

Evelyn Laurent and Ethan Sullivan had to be hiding there. With the cruise ship gone, they had no other options.

"Twelve men missing!" the pirate leader suddenly roared.

"Must've been taken by Evelyn's team!" someone shouted.

Hugo noticed several pirates trembling. They'd heard rumors about Evelyn's elite forces—and the fate of those captured alive.

"Peacekeepers..." a voice whispered.

The leader raised his rifle. "Shut your mouth!"

Hugo edged back half a step. He caught pirates exchanging nervous glances—the telltale signs of retreat.

A faint rustle came from the jungle.

Every pirate tensed, weapons snapping toward the sound.

Hugo's breath hitched.

He knew—Evelyn was repositioning.

A bitter sea wind swept in, carrying the tang of salt. Distant lights flickered on the horizon.

No one could tell if they belonged to a passing freighter—or the coast guard.
###Chapter 433

The pirate captain stared at the breached hull, his expression shifting between anger and despair.

"Boss, we need to leave now!" his second-in-command urged frantically.

The deck reeked of gunpowder. Over a dozen crew members were missing. The captain clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white.

"Split into two groups," he growled through gritted teeth. "The able-bodied go first. The wounded stay."

The ship groaned under the strain, seawater gushing through the bullet holes. Pirates scrambled to patch the leaks, their movements growing sluggish.

Meanwhile, the Southern Cross had already sailed out of danger.

"Coast Guard Vessel 001 calling Southern Cross, report your status!"

Timothy Gold grabbed the radio excitedly. "This is Southern Cross! We've escaped safely with twelve pirate prisoners!"

Julian Langley stood on deck, his gaze locked on the distant island. Suddenly, he turned and sprinted toward the Coast Guard ship. "I'm coming with you!"

The armed officers wore tactical vests loaded with ammunition. Julian shrank into a corner like a lost lamb among wolves.

"The pirates are retreating," he pointed at the live surveillance feed. "They split into two groups."

On screen, pirates scrambled toward speedboats in panic. Gunfire erupted from the trees on both sides.

Ethan Sullivan's voice cut through the smoke. "Müller Pirate Crew, you're surrounded!"

The captain whirled around, his face paling. "How does he know our name?"

"No time for that!" The second-in-command snarled, raising his submachine gun. "Shoot our way out!"

Bullets rained down like a storm, splintering tree trunks. Evelyn Laurent pressed against a boulder, hearing rounds whistle overhead.

"Reload!" Ethan barked.

They moved in sync, their muzzles flashing. Precise shots dropped three pirates, howling as they clutched bleeding thighs.

"Cover me!" The captain roared, charging toward a speedboat.

Another barrage kicked up dirt. Evelyn rolled behind a tree, deafened by gunfire.

On the horizon, Coast Guard vessels cut through the waves toward them.
###Chapter 434

The gunshots faded.

Evelyn Laurent and Ethan Sullivan vanished like ghosts.

They never lingered after firing.

This was guerrilla warfare—life or death.

The pirates were driven mad by their phantom attacks.

"Damn it! Where are they?"

"Spread out! Take cover!"

Several pirate teams crept toward the gunfire.

They had no idea how many enemies hid on the island.

Every step was taken with extreme caution.

Evelyn and Ethan held their breath.

Like leopards in the shadows, they waited for the perfect moment.

When the pirates let their guard down—

Bang! Bang!

Two more precise shots.

They fired and fled without hesitation.

The pirates cursed in frustration.

"Bastards! Fight us face-to-face!"

Meanwhile, the 001 warship detected the island's commotion.

Julian Langley's face turned pale.

"Full speed ahead!"

His nails dug into his palms.

Every soldier on board tensed.

"Warning! Drop your weapons and surrender!"

The bilingual command echoed across the sea.

Evelyn's eyes lit up.

"Reinforcements are here!"

The pirates panicked.

"Retreat! The Lowell forces are coming!"

They abandoned their comrades and scattered.

Drone footage streamed live to the command center.

"Team A, flank the east! Team B, block the west!"

Highly trained soldiers stormed the island.

Ethan pushed through the dense foliage and found Evelyn.

His gaze swept over her.

"You okay?"

Evelyn shook her head, lips curving slightly.

"Good teamwork."

The synchronized march of boots grew louder.

"Drop your weapons! Hands on your heads!"

The pirates were surrounded.

Hugo Rothschild stood among them, grim-faced.

He was the first to raise his hands.

"We surrender."
###Chapter 435

Chaos erupted among the pirate ranks. Their earlier arrogance had completely vanished.

"I surrender!" A trembling voice broke through first.

One after another, more voices joined in surrender. The pirates dropped their weapons and crouched with hands behind their heads.

The clatter of metal filled the air as weapons piled on the ground.

Each pirate's face showed bitter resentment. Their carefully planned operation had ended in utter failure.

Hugo Rothschild seized the confusion to approach a soldier.

"I'm a citizen," he whispered urgently. "A guest on the reality show forced to blend in with them."

The soldier studied him with sharp eyes before escorting him away from the pirates.

Hugo exhaled deeply, shaking his head at his disheveled appearance.

Evelyn Laurent and Ethan Sullivan approached swiftly.

The squad leader snapped to attention with a crisp salute upon seeing them.

Ethan returned the salute with practiced ease.

Evelyn hesitated briefly before mirroring the respectful gesture.

"Ethan, this operation succeeded thanks to you," the leader said warmly.

Ethan shook his head. "The credit belongs to Evelyn."

The leader turned to Evelyn with admiration. "Captain Liu Changjin of Coast Guard Vessel 001."

He extended his hand, but Ethan intercepted the handshake.

"Evelyn Laurent," Ethan introduced tersely.

Captain Liu gave Ethan a knowing look before their hands parted.

"What's the plan for them?" Ethan gestured toward the subdued pirates.

"The Muller Pirate Crew are international fugitives," Captain Liu said gravely. "They'll face justice under international law."

Ethan nodded in understanding.

He glanced at the circling drones. "You can cut the live feed now."

Timothy Gold received the signal and immediately terminated the broadcast.

The live stream exploded with reactions.

[They're safe at last!]

[All thanks to Evelyn and Ethan!]

[The Sullivan-Laurent duo were incredible!]

By midnight, #SullivanLaurentHeroics topped trending lists.

As guards escorted the pirates away, many cast fearful glances at Evelyn.

This woman had single-handedly destroyed their operation.

Just as the group prepared to leave, Ethan suddenly felt an icy chill down his spine.

He whirled around, pupils contracting.

In that split second, he lunged toward Evelyn without hesitation.
###Chapter 436

"Bang!"

The gunshot shattered the island's tranquility.

Evelyn Laurent felt a violent impact slam into her back.

She staggered and turned, instinctively catching Ethan Sullivan as he collapsed.

Warm, sticky blood coated her palms.

The metallic scent of iron flooded her nostrils.

Her vision blurred with crimson.

"Who fired that shot?"

"Commander Sullivan!"

"Hold him down!"

Amid the chaos, the assailant was pinned to the ground by soldiers, howling like a slaughtered pig.

Evelyn stood frozen, as if trapped in a vacuum.

The weight in her arms grew heavier.

Ethan's eyelids fluttered open briefly, confirming her safety before closing again.

"Medics! Where the hell are the medics?"

Julian Langley's voice trembled with barely contained panic.

Two medical personnel rushed forward, transferring Ethan onto a stretcher.

Blood gushed from his back, soaking the fabric.

"Move! Clear the way!"

The stretcher team sprinted toward the ship like arrows loosed from a bow.

They collided with Julian, who was running in the opposite direction.

His legs gave out.

He dropped to his knees, crawling toward his sister. "Evelyn! Are you hurt?"

Her arms remained outstretched, frozen in position.

The blood on her hands had darkened to rust.

"Julian..." Her voice was feather-light. "Where's Ethan?"

His Adam's apple bobbed. "The medics took him aboard."

He gripped her icy fingers, unable to voice the terrifying question.

The final moments before the live feed cut out replayed in his mind.

In the blink of an eye, their world had turned upside down.
###Chapter 437

The sea wind carried the acrid scent of gunpowder.

Evelyn Laurent's fingertips trembled slightly, the blood on her palm long dried into a dark crimson. She moved mechanically with the evacuation team, her gaze fixed on the direction of Vessel 001.

"Evelyn?" Julian Langley waved a hand before her eyes.

She jolted awake, then suddenly broke into a sprint. Her combat boots thudded against the deck like a drumbeat against her ribs.

The operating room lights glared harshly.

Liu Changjin stood at the end of the corridor, his dark face glistening with sweat. "Bullet through the left chest, severe blood loss..." His voice rasped like sandpaper.

Evelyn staggered, bracing herself against the wall.

She remembered the moment Ethan Sullivan collapsed. The man who always stood tall as a pine tree crumpled into her arms, his warmth seeping through her back, burning her skin.

"Captain... Ethan?" Her own voice sounded distant, unreal.

Liu hung up the call, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Yes."

Silence swallowed the corridor.

In the distance, waves crashed against the hull, each strike more urgent than the last. Evelyn stared at her bloodstained palm, noticing flecks of dried crimson still lodged under her nails.

"Why did you call him Captain?"

Liu's camouflage collar was smeared with blood. He opened his mouth—then a shrill alarm blared from his combat terminal. Both turned as the operating room doors slid open.

The lead surgeon removed his mask, revealing exhausted eyes.
###Chapter 438

Evelyn Laurent instantly regretted her words.

Her fingers clenched the hem of her shirt, knuckles turning white.

"Sorry, I shouldn't have asked that." She lowered her lashes, her voice barely audible.

The red light above the operating room burned her eyes.

Liu Changjin stared at the door for a long moment before finally speaking. "Miss Laurent, when Captain Sullivan wakes up—"

He hesitated, leaving the sentence unfinished.

Evelyn's head snapped up.

She caught the flicker of something unreadable in Liu's eyes—a secret too heavy to voice.

The bench outside the OR was cold.

Evelyn curled into herself, staring at the bloodstains on her shoes.

That dark crimson belonged to Ethan Sullivan.

The first light of dawn crept across the horizon.

The sunrise over the ocean should have been beautiful, but no one had the heart to admire it now.

Julian Langley's hand trembled around his phone.

He'd reassured their parents they were safe but said nothing about the man fighting for his life behind those doors.

"Julian..."

Evelyn's voice was feather-light.

Her brother turned to see tear tracks on her pale face.

The OR doors swung open.

Everyone held their breath.

The surgeon removed his mask, eyes bloodshot. "He'll live."

Evelyn's knees buckled.

"The bullet grazed the pulmonary artery. One more centimeter and—" The doctor gestured. "It lodged in the third rib."

Liu suddenly covered his face, shoulders shaking.

"When will he wake up?" Evelyn barely recognized her own trembling voice.

The doctor shook his head. "Severe blood loss. Organ damage. It's up to his willpower now."

Rapid footsteps echoed down the corridor.

Several uniformed men approached, their leader grim-faced. "Status?"

Liu snapped to attention. "Sir, Captain Sullivan is stable!"

Watching their exchanged glances, Evelyn realized—

Ethan Sullivan was far more than the man she thought she knew.

His secrets ran deeper than she could imagine.
###Chapter 439

The doctor's words finally eased Evelyn Laurent's tense nerves.

She stared at the closed operating room doors, her voice urgent. "How is he now?"

The doctor removed his mask, revealing a weary but gentle smile. "The surgery was successful, but..."

His gaze lingered on Evelyn, brows furrowing. "Your injuries need immediate attention."

Julian Langley snapped his head up. "Injuries? What injuries?"

He rushed to Evelyn's side in three quick strides, only then noticing her disheveled state.

Her military uniform was unrecognizable, caked with dirt. Twigs and dried leaves tangled in her hair.

"It's nothing," Evelyn murmured dismissively, her eyes still fixed on the operating room.

Julian seized her wrist. "You call this nothing?"

A female medic appeared with a first aid kit. "Come with me."

Evelyn hesitated, glancing back at the operating room.

"I'll stand guard here," Julian said firmly. "You'll be notified the moment there's news."

Inside the treatment room, Evelyn removed her soiled jacket.

The medic gasped—pale skin marred by angry bruises and raw abrasions, some still oozing blood.

"How did this happen?" The medic's voice softened.

Evelyn remained silent. Exhaustion crashed over her like a tidal wave, her eyelids growing heavy.

"Sleep," the medic whispered. "You're safe here."

Amidst the antiseptic scent, Evelyn succumbed to slumber.

The medic worked with meticulous care, disinfecting and dressing each wound.

Outside, Julian paced relentlessly.

When the medic emerged, he intercepted her instantly. "Well?"

"Superficial injuries." She handed him a fresh uniform. "Let her rest."

Through the door's narrow gap, Julian glimpsed Evelyn curled on the cot—the oversized uniform making her appear heartbreakingly small.

His fists clenched, nails biting deep into his palms.
###Chapter 440

The fVossrescent lights in the hospital corridor cast a pale glow. Julian Langley hung his head, fingers digging deep into his palms.

He stared at the gaps between the floor tiles as if they held all the answers.

"It's all my fault..."

His whisper was barely audible.

The heavy tread of military boots echoed down the hall before stopping beside him.

"Look up."

The officer from the Southern Fleet spoke with a hoarse voice that brooked no argument.

Julian's head jerked up, meeting the bloodshot eyes of Commander Liu Changjin.

"Know why we call them 'Sea Wolves'?"

Liu turned toward the window where storm clouds churned on the horizon.

"Because the scent of blood drives them mad."

Julian swallowed hard, a cold sweat breaking across his back.

Liu spun abruptly, medals glinting like ice on his uniform.

"You should thank those two."

He pointed at the glowing red light above the operating room.

"If Captain Song hadn't taken that bullet—"

The unfinished sentence hung between them as veins bulged in Liu's neck.

Outside, seagulls shrieked with piercing intensity.

"They brought heavy artillery."

Liu ground out the words through clenched teeth, fist slamming against the windowsill.

"Meant to turn the whole island into a slaughterhouse."

Julian remembered the fishermen he'd seen upon arrival, a chill crawling up his spine.

"Muller's men..."

"Top three on Interpol's most wanted."

Liu gave a mirthless laugh, pulling out a crumpled wanted poster.

The scarred face in the photo made Julian's stomach twist.

"This time they bit off more than they could chew."

The commander's voice turned lethal, dropping the temperature in the corridor.

"The Southern Fleet has mobilized."

Metal buttons clinked as he tucked away the poster.

"Time to settle some debts."

The operating light flicked off. Both men turned as one.

When the doctor emerged, Julian's legs buckled. He caught himself against the wall.

"Remember this."

Liu gave his shoulder a final firm clasp.

"You're heroes, not criminals."
###Chapter 441

Dawn broke as the warship sailed out of the danger zone.

Julian Langley woke in the cabin to find endless blue waves outside the porthole.

"We're preparing to dock," Liu Changjin stood on the deck, the sea breeze lifting the hem of his coat. "Captain Sullivan will be sent for medical examination first."

Julian rubbed his temples. Before he could speak, the opposite cabin door swung open.

Evelyn Laurent emerged in full military uniform, her epaulets glinting in the morning light.

"Sis!" Julian rushed forward, fingers tightening around her sleeve. "Are you hurt?"

"Just scratches." She flexed her wrist, but her gaze drifted past him to the closed operating room. "Where's Ethan Sullivan?"

Liu Changjin studied Evelyn for a long moment.

The girl stood straight as a pine, her composure belying her youth. What a pity... he sighed inwardly. How could the Laurent family send their treasured daughter into the military?

"Why are you staring at me?" Evelyn arched a brow.

"Upon returning to the capital, military command will contact you," Liu said solemnly. "The captain's condition is stable, but we must proceed with the mission."

Before he finished speaking, Hugo Rothschild stepped out from the neighboring cabin, his arm in a sling, and saluted Liu with perfect form.

"Prepare for handover," Liu checked his watch.

At that moment, the operating room doors opened. Ethan Sullivan lay on the gurney, tubes snaking from his body, his face pale as paper.

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms.

Amid the wail of ambulance sirens, they arrived at Central Hospital. The moment they stepped out, Beatrice Quincy's cheerful voice rang out.

"Professor Laurent!"

The girl fluttered over like a butterfly, morning dew still clinging to her hair.
###Chapter 442

Julian Langley didn't even spare her a glance as he strode past.

Timothy Gold rushed over in a panic. "Is everyone alright?"

His gaze flickered over Julian before landing on Evelyn Laurent and Hugo Rothschild.

His expression suddenly darkened.

"Where's Ethan Sullivan?"

The show's golden goose was missing.

Where had their sugar daddy gone?

The next second, his eyes locked onto the stretcher being unloaded from the ambulance.

Timothy gasped.

He stared at Ethan on the stretcher, voice trembling. "What...what happened?"

Ethan had been perfectly fine when they cut the live stream.

How could things change so drastically in such a short time?

Julian gripped Timothy's shoulder. "Keep your mouth shut."

Timothy's heart pounded wildly. "Mr. Sullivan...he..."

"He'll live." Julian's tone was flat.

Timothy exhaled shakily but still tugged at his hair in frustration.

He'd done more hair-pulling today than in the past year combined.

At this rate, he'd go bald.

But aside from tearing at his scalp, he had no other way to relieve the stress.

This was supposed to be a simple reality show.

Why did it feel like navigating an obstacle course with endless hurdles?

The worst part?

Financial losses were the least of his worries.

If anything happened to Ethan...

He didn't dare finish the thought.

The other guests exchanged uneasy glances.

The production team soon issued a statement, arranging for everyone's evacuation.

All expenses would be covered by the show.

Though many had been injured during the pirate confrontation, most wounds weren't serious.

Ethan's condition was the most critical, followed by Xander Quincy, then Hugo.

Hugo had brought that on himself.

Once Ethan's vitals stabilized, Julian chartered a private jet to return Ethan, Xander, and the others to Cambridge.

Beatrice Quincy and Bianca Fairchild were forced to accompany them.

Though reluctant, Julian and Evelyn had no choice.

Bianca retreated into silence again, fidgeting nervously.

When she retrieved her phone, one message stood out:

Grandma's missing!

No one knew who took her or where she'd gone.

Strangely, Bianca felt no panic—only a flicker of hope.

Had the Langley family rescued Grandma?

If so...

She might finally escape the Quincy hellhole.

The thought of returning with Beatrice terrified her.

The way Beatrice had stared at her on the ship sent chills down her spine.

That lunatic was definitely saving up rage to unleash on her.

Bianca's anxiety spiked.

Then a cool hand gently clasped hers.

Evelyn's touch was like a clear spring, soothing her frayed nerves.

"Don't be afraid," Evelyn whispered. "Everything will be alright."
###Chapter 443

Bianca Fairchild's eyes instantly welled up.

She bit her lower lip hard and nodded firmly. "Okay!"

Beatrice Quincy's mocking laughter drifted from nearby.

No one bothered to acknowledge her.

Bianca finally lifted her gaze, her eyes involuntarily drifting forward.

Ethan Sullivan and Xander Quincy still lay in the isolation zone.

The show's two most distinguished guests happened to be the most severely injured.

Evelyn Laurent immediately noticed the worry in Bianca's eyes.

She was concerned about Ethan too.

But Bianca... was she worried about Xander?

"Is that scumbag worth your concern?"

Evelyn lowered her voice.

Bianca's fingers trembled slightly.

She glanced at Beatrice, who was resting with her eyes closed.

Quickly pulling out her phone, her fingers flew across the screen.

Evelyn waited silently.

A hidden past gradually unfolded on the screen.

Evelyn's pupils contracted.

Taking the phone, she typed a question: "Do you still love him?"

Bianca's expression shifted unpredictably. "I'm not sure..."

This forbidden love was doomed from the start.

The scandal of sibling incest would disgrace the Quincy family.

The Quincys would never tolerate their adopted daughter tarnishing their name.

Nor would they let their prized Luck Charmer escape their control.

Evelyn suddenly gripped Bianca's wrist tightly.

"I'll help you."

She sent another message: "Your grandmother is safe at my brother Nathaniel's research institute."

Tears spilled from Bianca's eyes.

This was what she cared about most.

Evelyn pressed further: "What's your plan after this?"

Bianca's gaze grew resolute. "Leaving the country."

Only abroad could she truly break free from the Quincys.

Evelyn nodded thoughtfully.

"Leave it to me."

In this twisted relationship, Xander's betrayal was inevitable.

No depth of emotion could withstand the cruelty of reality.
###Chapter 444

Bianca's knuckles turned white as she clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

She had never imagined this day would truly come.

Leaving the country. Changing her name. Breaking free from the Fairchild family's shackles once and for all.

This dream had haunted her for years. Now, it was finally within reach.

Evelyn gazed at the churning sea of clouds outside the airplane window, but her thoughts drifted to the man who had shielded her.

When Ethan had thrown himself in front of her, she had seen the resolve burning in his eyes.

The muffled thud of the bullet piercing his chest still echoed in her ears.

"I need to see him."

She suddenly unbuckled her seatbelt, her voice barely audible.

Julian opened his mouth as if to speak, then silently watched her walk toward the business-class cabin.

The modified cabin reeked of antiseptic.

Ethan lay on a specialized medical bed, surrounded by monitors emitting cold, clinical light.

His lips were as pale as paper. Crimson stains seeped through the bandages wrapped around his chest.

Evelyn gently touched his icy hand.

She remembered how warm and strong those hands had always been. Now, they felt like frozen jade.

"Was it worth it?"

Her whisper traced the lines of his palm.

The steady beeping of the heart monitor answered her silent question.

The soft cabin lights cast faint shadows across his face, his long lashes forming crescent moons against his cheeks.

Suddenly, she remembered that morning on the island—when he had turned toward the rising sun and extended his hand to her.

He had smiled then and said, "I've got you."

Now he lay here, proving it with his life.

An unfamiliar ache swelled in her chest. She pressed his hand against her cheek.

Warm tears fell silently, soaking their intertwined fingers.

"Ethan..."

She whispered his name like a distant dream.

Outside, a golden ray of sunlight broke through the clouds, streaming through the window to illuminate their clasped hands.

As if fate had offered its faintest reply.
###Chapter 445

Evelyn's fingertips trembled slightly as they brushed against Ethan's hand.

His broad palm radiated warmth, his long fingers making hers appear delicate in comparison. She could barely wrap her hand around four of his fingers, her thumb resting lightly on his knuckles.

The sterile scent of disinfectant mingled with osmanthus drifting through the window.

Her gaze lingered on Ethan's pale face. His thick lashes cast shadows beneath his eyes, and his usually vibrant lips had lost their color.

Memories flooded her mind.

That rainy night outside White Rock Village when he'd approached her under a black umbrella. The bustling streets of Cambridge where he always positioned himself between her and traffic. How his eyes never left her whenever she turned to look at him.

All those unnoticed details had been his silent confession.

"Ethan..." she whispered, her voice softening without realizing it.

Her fingertip absently traced circles on his palm. She remembered the library where he'd guided her hand to practice calligraphy, his warm breath making her pulse race.

Evelyn lowered her head, pressing her cheek against his hand.

"You know," she murmured, "I was never afraid to be alone with you."

The hospital curtain fluttered as sunlight danced across the floor. The heart monitor beeped steadily like a quiet response.

Three hours later at Cambridge International Airport.

Victoria paced near the arrivals gate, gripping her purse strap. When Evelyn appeared, she rushed forward.

"Evelyn!"

Her mother's familiar perfume enveloped her as they embraced. Evelyn felt Victoria's shoulders trembling.

"Mom, I'm okay," she reassured softly, then met Richard's red-rimmed eyes.

The five Langley brothers swarmed around them with questions. Julian lingered at the periphery, hesitating to speak.

Nearby, Vincent Sullivan leaned against a pillar, his assessing gaze sweeping over Evelyn. Satisfied she was unharmed, the older man exhaled quietly before approaching the ambulance.

"Brat," he muttered to Ethan on the stretcher, "if you're going to fake sleep, at least do it convincingly. Your smirk's obvious."

Ethan's lashes fluttered almost imperceptibly.
###Chapter 446

The hospital corridor was bathed in harsh fVossrescent light.

The five Lowell brothers wore grim expressions as Ethan Sullivan was wheeled into the emergency room.

Evelyn Laurent suddenly grabbed Bianca Fairchild's wrist.

"Come with me."

Beatrice Quincy's pupils constricted. "Bianca, don't you dare!"

Bianca shook off Beatrice's grasping hand and followed Evelyn without looking back.

The Quincy parents arrived late.

"Beatrice!" Mrs. Quincy cupped her daughter's face. "You look exhausted."

Mr. Quincy frowned at the stretcher bearing Xander Quincy. "Boys should toughen up through injuries."

They didn't even notice one daughter was missing.

Until Beatrice stomped her foot. "Bianca ran off with Evelyn Laurent!"

Mrs. Quincy's face darkened. "How dare she!"

"Cut off the old woman's medical funds immediately." Mr. Quincy pulled out his phone. "Let's see if she still has the nerve—"

A dial tone buzzed from the receiver.

He smashed the phone against the wall. "She's been transferred!"

Beatrice dug her nails into her palms. "The Lowells must be behind this!"

"Stay calm." Mr. Quincy narrowed his eyes. "Legally, she's still a Quincy."

The emergency room's red light suddenly switched off.

A doctor pushed through the doors. "The patient needs a blood transfusion. Family members—"

Evelyn was already rolling up her sleeve. "Take mine."

Bianca stopped her. "I'll do it."

As they shared a smile, Mr. Quincy's roar echoed from the corridor's end. "Bianca!"
###Chapter 447

Beatrice Quincy's pupils contracted slightly as she grasped the hidden meaning in her father's words.

Bianca Fairchild still bore the Quincy family name.

To the Quincys, she might be nothing more than a Luck Charmer. But she remained one of them.

How dare the Langleys take a Quincy without permission?

Unless they were prepared to burn all bridges.

As one of the four elite families in the capital, the Langleys wouldn't be so reckless.

Reginald Quincy's eyes glinted coldly as he plotted Bianca's retrieval. He didn't know she'd already left with Evelyn Laurent, speeding toward the international airport.

Bianca bought a last-minute international ticket and boarded without hesitation.

The timing wasn't ideal.

But this was her only chance to escape the Quincys forever.

As for her grandmother—she trusted Evelyn implicitly to care for her. They'd arranged a video call once Bianca settled abroad.

No time for luggage. Just her passport, phone, and the black card Evelyn pressed into her hand—Alexander Langley's unlimited global credit line.

Every second counted. She had to leave the country before the Quincys noticed. Then disappear completely.

Outside the airport, inside a Langley vehicle, Evelyn watched the ascending plane with conflicted emotions.

Victoria Langley squeezed her hand. "Bianca will be safe."

She understood Bianca's plight. Supported her escape from the Quincy gilded cage.

Evelyn nodded absently.

Victoria smiled knowingly. "Worried about Ethan?"

Evelyn didn't deny it. "Yes."

A pause. "He got hurt protecting me."

Victoria sighed but said nothing more.

Their convoy headed straight to the hospital for Ethan Sullivan's full examination.

In the corridor, Richard Langley approached Vincent Sullivan with visible guilt. "Old friend, this time—"

Vincent raised a hand. "No apologies necessary."

His expression remained calm, even smiling at Evelyn. "Ethan made his own choice. This isn't on you."

Evelyn blinked. "Uncle Vincent..."

The older man chuckled. Though his only son lay unconscious from saving Evelyn, no resentment showed. "I'd have beaten him if he failed to protect you."

"That boy finally acts like a man!"

The words struck Evelyn deeply.

The facade of indifference couldn't hide the truth—this was his sole heir. How could he not care?
###Chapter 448

The air in the hallway seemed frozen.

The hospital door suddenly swung open. The attending physician removed his surgical mask.

"Doctor!"

Vincent Sullivan stood abruptly, his voice carrying an imperceptible tremor.

"The bullet penetrated the left lung lobe and lodged in the third rib." The doctor wiped sweat from his brow. "The surgery was successful. No major blood vessels were damaged."

He paused before adding, "One more centimeter, and it would have nicked the pulmonary artery."

A chorus of sharp inhales echoed through the corridor.

Vincent suddenly barked out a laugh. "That stubborn brat's got nine lives!"

He braced his hands on his knees to stand. Richard Langley immediately steadied him. Feeling the older man's arm tremble, Richard's expression darkened.

Evelyn Laurent had already explained everything.

That bullet had been aimed directly at her temple.

Ethan Sullivan had taken the fatal shot for her.

The hospital room was so quiet you could hear the IV drip.

Ethan's pallid face showed no trace of color. Only the steady beeping of the heart monitor proved he still lived.

Vincent studied his son for a long moment before turning to Evelyn.

"Evelyn."

She looked up instantly. "Mr. Sullivan."

The older man rubbed his hands together, looking slightly abashed. "That boy's lying here because he saved you."

He cleared his throat. "Don't you think... you should stay to care for him?"

Vincent's ears turned red the moment the words left his mouth.

For once, none of the six Langley brothers objected.

Their gazes lingered on the hospital bed, remembering Ethan's words that day.

He truly had been willing to die for Evelyn.

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "I'll take care of him."
###Chapter 449

Sunlight streamed through the hospital curtains as Evelyn Laurent sat by Ethan Sullivan's bedside, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her shirt.

Vincent Sullivan's meaningful glance before leaving had made her heart skip a beat.

"Ding—"

Her phone chimed.

She looked down at the bank notification displaying a staggering sum that made her dizzy.

"Uncle Sullivan really..." she muttered under her breath, shoving the phone back into her pocket.

Ethan lay pale as parchment on the bed, his thick lashes casting shadows beneath his eyes.

Victoria Langley gently patted her daughter's shoulder. "Evelyn, why don't you go home and rest?"

"No." Evelyn shook her head without taking her eyes off Ethan. "I'll wait until he wakes up."

Nathaniel Langley adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses after checking the monitors. "The bullet grazed his heart. Lucky bastard."

Evelyn's fists clenched.

"Fourth brother!" Her voice trembled. "Must you phrase it like that?"

Nathaniel raised an eyebrow, but Richard Langley's phone vibrated before he could respond.

Richard frowned at the caller ID. "The Quincys."

In the hallway, Reginald Quincy's roar erupted from the phone the moment Richard answered. "Richard Langley! Where the hell is my daughter?"

Richard's laugh was cold. "What nonsense is this, Reginald? Didn't Bianca return with your people?"

"Bullshit!" Reginald spat. "Surveillance shows Bianca was last seen with Evelyn!"

"Oh?" Richard leisurely adjusted his cufflinks. "Then you should file a police report instead of shouting at me."

The sound of shattering glass came through the line.

"Don't think the Sullivans can protect you forever!" Reginald hissed. "If I don't see Bianca in twenty-four hours—"

"Reginald," Richard's voice turned glacial. "Choose your next words carefully."

He hung up and turned to find Victoria watching him with concern. "The Quincys?"

"Just pathetic clowns." Richard wrapped an arm around his wife's shoulders. "Let's give Evelyn and Ethan some privacy."

The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn's shoulders slumped.

She reached out, barely brushing Ethan's ice-cold fingertips. The contact made her eyes burn.

"Idiot..." she whispered. "Who asked you to take a bullet for me?"

Outside the window, the setting sun stretched their shadows long across the floor.
###Chapter 450

Reginald Quincy's knuckles turned white as he gripped his phone, his voice tight with suppressed fury. "I'm warning you—release my daughter immediately!"

His Adam's apple bobbed as he added, "Or I'll call the police right now!"

Richard Langley's light chuckle came through the line. "The police?"

The laugh dripped with undisguised mockery.

Reginald's spine stiffened. "The Langley family wouldn't want this kind of trouble, would they?"

"Trouble?" Richard drawled. "You should worry about your own house first, Mr. Quincy."

The words sent a jolt through Reginald. "What do you mean?"

Only the dial tone answered him.

Reginald stared at the darkened screen, his chest heaving.

Then his phone vibrated.

A notification flashed: #Shocking Truth Behind the Quincy Sisters#

His fingers trembled as he tapped the link.

His face drained of color the moment he saw the contents.

Frantically, he exited and opened Twitter.

The top ten trending topics were all about the Quincy family.

#Beatrice Quincy's Luck Transfer# sat at the top, marked with a glaring "BREAKING."

The world spun around Reginald.

He clicked the topic. Pinned at the top was Bianca Fairchild's verified exposé.

The lengthy post detailed Beatrice's years of exploiting her as a "luck charm," even revealing her own status as an adopted daughter—merely a "living talisman" cultivated for Beatrice's benefit.

The comments section had exploded.

[What the hell? This is medieval superstition in the 21st century?]

[So all of Beatrice's opportunities came from this? Disgusting!]

[No wonder Bianca always looked off—she was being drained this whole time.]

[The Quincy family is terrifying. Treating people like tools?]

The fatal blow came with Bianca's attached evidence: audio recordings, videos, and photos of injuries.

Each piece tore through the Quincy family's carefully constructed facade like a knife.

Reginald's vision darkened.

Bianca had prepared all this before boarding her flight.

She'd been waiting for this moment far too long.
###Chapter 451

"Ahhh—!"

A piercing scream shattered the tranquility of the Quincy mansion.

Beatrice Quincy bolted barefoot down the stairs, her meticulously styled curls now a wild tangle around her shoulders. Her knuckles turned white as she clutched her phone.

"Father! It's a disaster!"

Reginald Quincy looked up from his tea in the parlor to see his daughter's face drained of color.

"That bitch... Bianca Fairchild..." Beatrice's voice trembled. "She's exposed everything!"

The phone screen displayed the top ten trending hashtags: #QuincyScandal, #BeatriceLuckTransfer, #BiancaFairchildExposé.

Beatrice's entire body shook, her perfectly applied eyeliner now smeared. The newly crowned Oscar-winning actress resembled a hysterical madwoman, her elegance gone.

"Stay calm." Reginald's expression darkened. "I'll contact PR immediately."

He dialed with icy precision. "Deploy the paid trolls. Claim those videos and audio recordings are fabricated. Get influencers to declare Bianca mentally unstable."

Thirty minutes later, his assistant called in panic. "Mr. Quincy, the trolls got exposed instantly! The backlash is uncontrollable!"

Beatrice's social media followers plummeted before her eyes—eight million, seven million, six... The numbers kept dropping.

Each notification chime stabbed like a knife:

[Die, Beatrice! Feudal scum!]
[I voted for you—how disgusting!]
[Investigate how she won that Oscar!]

Reginald watched the stock ticker with cold sweat. Quincy Enterprises' shares nosedived, evaporating billions in minutes.

"Father..." Beatrice collapsed to the floor, nails digging into her palms. "We're finished..."

Meanwhile, in the VIP suite of Central Hospital...

Xander Quincy's eyelids fluttered open. The sterile scent of antiseptic filled his nose. He turned his stiff neck—the room stood empty except for the steady beep of monitors.

"Bianca?"

The name cracked from his parched lips. No answer.

Fragmented memories flashed—the biting cliffside wind, Bianca's desperate screams, that falling silhouette...

He slammed the call button.

"Mr. Quincy! You're awake!" The nurse rushed in. "You've been unconscious for three days. Shall I notify your family?"

Xander's pupils constricted. "Three days? Where's my sister?"

The nurse hesitated. "Miss Fairchild... checked out yesterday."

Outside, the storm unleashed its fury.
###Chapter 452

Xander Quincy struggled to open his eyes. His throat burned like fire.

"Who brought me here?" His voice came out hoarse.

The nurse adjusted his IV without looking up. "Your parents and sister."

Xander's gaze darkened. "Where are they?"

The nurse frowned. "Left hours ago. No one's staying with you in this condition." Disapproval laced her tone.

His lips twisted. Of course.

In the Quincy family, Beatrice always came first. In his current state, he probably wasn't worth one strand of her hair.

His phone screen lit up. A trending notification stabbed into his vision:

#Quincy Adopted Daughter Truth Exposed#

#Beatrice Quincy's Luck Charmer#

Xander's fingers trembled. The moment he clicked the link, his blood turned to ice.

Photos. Audio recordings. Bank transfer records. Every piece of evidence laid bare for the public.

"Bianca—" He jerked upright, pain from his injuries making his vision black out.

"Don't move!" The nurse pinned him down. "Three broken ribs and you're trying to get up?"

Xander ignored her, shaking as he dialed Bianca Fairchild's number.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."

The glaring red exclamation mark in their WeChat chat window stabbed through his heart like a knife.

He called Beatrice instead.

"Xander!" Beatrice sobbed hysterically. "That bitch Bianca—"

"Where is she?" he interrupted.

"Gone! She exposed all our family secrets!" Beatrice shrieked. "Dad swore he'd break her legs!"

Xander clenched the bedsheet. At least she escaped.

But where could she go? Did she have money? Would they find her?

Outside the window, the night stretched like ink. His heart sank into darkness.
###Chapter 453

The Quincy household was in complete chaos, with no one paying attention to Bianca Fairchild's whereabouts.

The online storm had barely settled when Reginald Quincy finally remembered to track down his daughter.

He discovered she had already boarded an international flight out of the country.

Her destination showed Australia.

But Reginald knew it was likely just a layover.

Once she left the country, tracking her would be nearly impossible.

"That bastard Richard Langley! How dare he help Bianca escape!"

Reginald smashed a teacup in fury.

He never expected the Langley family to openly oppose the Quincys for Bianca's sake.

In just a few days, the Quincy Group's market value plummeted by a billion.

Though it wasn't a fatal blow to the powerful Quincy family, the fallout went far beyond financial losses.

Beatrice Quincy was utterly ruined.

Dark secrets poured out—luck manipulation, diva behavior, stunt double abuse.

The once-glamorous rising starlet had become public enemy number one.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Laurent stood outside the ICU.

She gazed through the glass at Ethan Sullivan's unconscious form, her fingers absently digging into the windowsill.

The six Langley brothers tactfully retreated to the hallway.

"Could our sister actually..." Theodore Langley trailed off.

Alexander Langley stared at the ceiling. "We owe him for this."

"Putting his life on the line," Sebastian Langley added quietly.

The six exchanged silent glances.

Victoria Langley suddenly spoke up. "That boy Ethan is truly remarkable."

The brothers sighed in unison.

Though reluctant to admit it, they knew—there wasn't a more outstanding young man in the entire country than Ethan Sullivan.

Inside the ward, Evelyn was finally permitted to visit.

She gently grasped Ethan's cold hand, her gaze lingering on his pale lips.

A faint tremor traveled through his fingers.

Her head snapped up, meeting Ethan's slowly opening eyes.

Those usually sharp eyes now brimmed with tenderness, reflecting her startled expression.

"Does it hurt?" Her voice shook.

Ethan's lips curved slightly. "Worth it," he whispered.

When the bullet tore through the air, only one thought consumed him: Evelyn must not get hurt.

The conviction was so overwhelming his body moved before his mind could process it.

Now, seeing her safe beside him, he'd take that bullet again without hesitation.
###Chapter 454

Thankfully, he had protected her in the end. The bullet hadn't grazed her.

As for himself—this injury meant nothing.

Ethan Sullivan was no stranger to pain.

His gaze lingered on Evelyn Laurent, tenderness shimmering in his eyes.

Even in unconsciousness, he'd sensed her presence.

Her soft hands clutching his. The murmur of her voice by his ear.

Though the words were indistinct, he'd felt every shift in her emotions.

She cared for him.

That was enough.

"Ethan! You're awake?"

Evelyn snapped to attention, meeting his gentle stare.

She sprang up, voice bright with joy. "Water? Are you in pain anywhere?"

Ethan cleared his throat, voice rough. "Yes."

She turned to pour water, carefully supporting him as he drank.

His eyes never left her, warmth overflowing in his gaze.

Seeing her first thing upon waking—this was bliss.

"How long have you been awake?" Evelyn set the glass down, chagrined. "I didn't even notice."

The corner of his mouth lifted. "Just now."

A pause. Then softly, "You stayed the whole time?"

Evelyn hesitated before nodding.

"Thank you," she whispered.

Ethan chuckled. "I told you—never thank me."

"But you saved my life." Her gaze met his, complex emotions swirling.

His expression softened further. "Ten years ago, didn't you save mine?"

She shook her head. "You saved me too that day."

Drawing a breath, she spoke solemnly. "Ethan, I owe you my life."

He gave a hoarse laugh.

Eyes locked on hers, he slowly shook his head. "Protecting you was my vow."

"Anyone who harms you will have to kill me first."

Though his voice was weak, each word rang with steel.

Propped up in that hospital bed, his resolve burned brighter than ever.

Evelyn froze.

The intensity in his eyes scorched her, leaving her flustered.

She stood abruptly, nearly bolting for the door.

"Evelyn." His voice stopped her.

She turned stiffly.

Ethan's pale lips curved into a tender smile. "Give me another chance."

"What?"

"To be your fiancé again." His gaze never wavered. "I regret breaking our engagement."

"Let me try again. Please."
###Chapter 455

Ethan Sullivan's heart pounded wildly after speaking those words.

His gaze remained fixed on Evelyn Laurent's face, searching for any reaction.

A thin layer of sweat coated his palms.

Taking that bullet for her had been pure instinct.

Even now, he didn't regret it.

His father's words—"Persistence wins"—echoed in his mind.

For days, he'd shamelessly followed her from the island to this hospital room.

Though she complained, she never truly pushed him away.

Ethan knew his gamble had paid off.

Evelyn pressed her lips together in silence.

Her lashes fluttered, emotions swirling in her eyes.

Finally, she spoke. "We'll see how you behave."

Ethan's eyes instantly brightened.

He leaned closer, voice brimming with excitement. "If I do well, will you agree to be my girlfriend, Evie?"

Evelyn met his gaze.

The hopeful look in his eyes reminded her of a puppy begging for treats.

She nearly cracked a smile.

"Hmm." She feigned indifference with a single syllable.

Ethan immediately raised three fingers. "I promise!"

Evelyn glanced at his bandaged shoulder. "Focus on healing first."

"Yes, ma'am!" Grinning, he suddenly winced. "Ouch—that hurts."

Evelyn quickly steadied him. "Stop moving!"

Ethan seized the chance to grasp her hand. "My back aches."

"Serves you right." She glared. "Who asked you to play hero?"

Despite her words, she carefully helped him lie back down.

Ethan closed his eyes, satisfied.

As the painkillers took effect, he drifted back to sleep.

Evelyn sighed softly by his bedside.

For three days, she hadn't left his side.

His wounds were healing well, already scabbing over.

The atmosphere between them had grown increasingly charged.

Her phone vibrated suddenly—a video call from Bianca Fairchild.

The girl appeared on screen wearing a black strappy dress against a foreign cityscape.

Sunlight haloed her figure, making her glow.

"Evie!"

Bianca's voice sparkled with energy.

Evelyn had never seen her smile so brightly before.

"Thank you for helping me escape." Bianca's eyes shimmered. "I'm doing great now."

Leaning against the window, Evelyn chuckled. "You'd have managed without me."

She'd always recognized the steel beneath this seemingly delicate girl's surface.

Bianca shook her head. "Not the same."

Azure coastline stretched behind her—free as a seagull in flight.

They chatted a while longer before ending the call.

Turning, Evelyn found Ethan awake, watching her intently.

"Did I wake you?" She adjusted his blanket.

He shook his head, then abruptly said, "Evie, I want an apple."

Evelyn picked up the fruit knife. "Demanding, aren't we?"

The way she focused on peeling the apple looked unexpectedly tender.

Ethan secretly snapped a photo with his phone.

The image captured her cascading hair and slender fingers.

He set it as his wallpaper immediately.
###Chapter 456

Bianca Fairchild's fingers paused mid-air, her lips curling into an enigmatic smile. "Perhaps. But not so soon."

She had been weaving an intricate web in the shadows for years.

Every shred of evidence capable of destroying the Quincy family had been meticulously gathered through tireless effort.

Evelyn Laurent's appearance was like fate delivering the perfect opportunity.

No one would suspect this seemingly docile adopted daughter of the Quincys had been sharpening her knives in secret.

When Evelyn escorted her out in broad daylight, the entire Quincy household stood frozen.

They never imagined their caged bird would peck through its own chains.

"Congratulations." Evelyn swirled her wineglass, mischief glinting in her eyes. "By the way, your dear sister has also been... 'reborn.'"

Bianca suddenly burst into laughter.

The sound was so unrestrained it seemed to make the clouds outside tremble.

Beatrice Quincy's acting career was finished.

Those carefully crafted illusions, that meticulously constructed persona—all shattered before the truth.

"She brought this upon herself." Bianca took a sip, her gaze glacial. "She should have seen this coming."

Evelyn gave a soft hum. "At least she'll stop clinging to my brother now."

The breach of contract penalty was pocket change for the Quincys.

But Beatrice's carefully maintained mask had been irrevocably torn away.

The sweetest part? Bianca had orchestrated it all.

The Quincy family must be frantic now.

Too bad they couldn't even touch the hem of Bianca's dress.

Before ending the video call, Evelyn sent Nathaniel Langley's contact information.

Want to see Grandma? First get past the youngest Langley heir.

As she set down her phone, Ethan Sullivan's amused voice came from behind. "So you're the one who helped Bianca escape."

Evelyn whirled around, her gaze sharp as a blade. "You wouldn't dare snitch."

She knew all too well about Ethan's friendship with Xander Quincy.

The man lounged on the sofa, collar slightly open. "Do I look like someone who enjoys meddling?"

Ice cubes clinked as he swirled his glass.

"I warned Xander." A flicker of mockery crossed Ethan's eyes. "Indecisiveness deserves its own punishment."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

Now that was satisfying to hear.

"Did Oliver and my brother warn him too?"

"Repeatedly." Ethan scoffed. "The man's as stubborn as a mule."

Now he feels the pain?

Too late.

###Chapter 457

"Don't worry. We'll leave as soon as you take the pill." The arrogant man waved his dagger. "You won't die immediately, so we have no reason to lie."

Shen Zhiqiang's gaze swept calmly over the three men.

"Fine."

He took the pill and swallowed it without hesitation, his Adam's apple bobbing as if he'd merely eaten candy.

"Shen Zhiqiang!" Su Muqing screamed, struggling violently. The arrogant man dropped the dagger in panic.

If this woman died, He Siyan would skin him alive.

She stumbled toward Shen Zhiqiang, her trembling fingers clawing at his throat. "Spit it out! Now! Who told you to take it?"

Shen Zhiqiang caught her icy hands, his lips curving into a gentle smile. "Too late. It's already dissolved. Let me look at you properly."

"You're insane!" Su Muqing shook uncontrollably, tears blurring her vision. "I never asked you to save me... Why didn't you listen?"

Her legs gave out, and she collapsed to the floor.

Shen Zhiqiang knelt on one knee and pulled her into his arms, his voice trembling slightly. "Isn't protecting my wife the most natural thing? I'm the one who should apologize—for getting you hurt."

"If it weren't for me, they never would've touched you!" She gripped his collar, her nails digging into her own palms.

She hated her own helplessness.

Shen Zhiqiang cupped her tear-streaked face, his burning gaze imprinting her image into his soul. "This was my choice, and I'll never regret it. Promise me you'll live well after I'm gone."

"Stop talking..." She buried her face in his chest, sobbing uncontrollably.

The three assassins exchanged uneasy glances.

The tall one wiped his eyes and muttered, "Boss, this is too much..."

The square-faced man sniffled. "Reminds me of my wife..."

The arrogant man scratched his head irritably. "Let's go. Give them some privacy."

Outside the hotel, the three climbed into a rundown van.

The arrogant man changed clothes while dialing a number. "It's done. Shen Zhiqiang took the poison."

He Siyan's icy voice came through. "I want to see him die with my own eyes."

"Relax, this poison is—" The call cut off abruptly. The man cursed and tossed his phone aside. "Rich bastard!"

The square-faced man rummaged for clean clothes when his fingers brushed against a sealed plastic bag.

His face turned deathly pale. "B-Boss! The pills... They're still here!"
###Chapter 458

"It's not too late to go now. Will you join me?" Ethan Sullivan gazed at Evelyn Laurent, hope flickering in his eyes.

Evelyn bit her lip, her gaze lingering on his unhealed wound. "Your injury..."

"It's nothing." The corner of his mouth lifted as his fingers brushed a stray lock of her hair. "I'll be careful."

Seeing his determination, she finally nodded.

Before departure, Evelyn stocked up on supplies. Upon hearing the news, Victoria Langley and Richard Langley immediately decided to accompany them, along with Evelyn's six brothers, who put aside their work to join the trip.

Ten Range Rovers stood in formation by the helipad, their engines roaring. Bodyguards loaded the supplies with practiced efficiency before the convoy snaked toward the outskirts of Cloudhaven.

Evelyn watched the scenery blur past the window, as if lifetimes had passed. Half a year ago, she had been a girl struggling to survive in White Stone Village. Now, she had a family bound by blood—and... She stole a glance at Ethan beside her.

"Is this where you grew up, Evelyn?" Victoria clutched her handkerchief, her eyes reddening at the sight of the rugged mountain road. "If only we had found you sooner..."

The convoy slowed as it navigated the winding mountain path. When they rounded a particular bend, Evelyn suddenly chuckled.

"Remember this place?" She poked Ethan's arm.

He followed her gaze, memories flooding back—the stormy evening, the mud-streaked girl with a bloodied shovel, and his assistant Harrison Whitmore nearly fainting in terror.

"Someone called the police and accused me of murder," Evelyn teased, narrowing her eyes.

Ethan's ears reddened, but he maintained a straight face. "Anyone would have misunderstood in that situation." He lowered his voice. "After all, my little fiancée looked like..."

"A psychopath who'd just disposed of a body?" she finished.

A chorus of coughs erupted in the car. Up front, Alexander Langley silently raised the partition.

With a sigh, Ethan pulled her into his arms, murmuring against her ear, "Like the angel who saved me."

The convoy rumbled over the muddy path as the outline of White Stone Village emerged in the distance. Evelyn stared at the place she'd called home for ten years, her fingers tightening around Ethan's sleeve.

"What's wrong?" He sensed her unease instantly.

"I'm afraid..." Her voice was barely audible. "Afraid this is all a dream."

Ethan interlaced their fingers, their hands clasped tight. "Then I'll stay in this dream with you—forever."
###Chapter 459

Ethan Sullivan's warm palm enveloped Evelyn Laurent's cool fingertips.

A swirl of complex emotions rose in Evelyn's chest.

She turned her face toward the window, unwilling to let Ethan see her reddened eyes.

Outside, the bleak winter landscape stretched endlessly. Withered yellow grass swayed in the wind.

The desolate view transported her back to her days in White Rock Village.

Back then, she had traveled between construction sites and the village, relying on her physical strength to earn meager wages.

"We're here."

Ethan's voice signaled the convoy's gradual stop at the village entrance.

Ten black Range Rovers lined up in perfect formation, drawing curious stares from the villagers.

Victoria Langley's eyes welled up the moment she stepped out.

Low adobe houses. Pothole-riddled dirt roads. Wispy smoke curling from rooftops. Gaunt elderly faces.

Evelyn took a deep breath and stepped onto the familiar soil.

"It's Evelyn!"

"Evelyn's back!"

Several sharp-eyed villagers recognized her, their excited shouts ringing out.

Evelyn flashed a radiant smile and waved. "Uncles, aunties, I've come back to see you!"

She moved quickly toward the crowd, but Ethan caught her wrist.

"Wait." His voice was low. He turned and signaled for everyone to exit the vehicles.

The Laurent family and their bodyguards formed a neat line behind Evelyn.

"Thank you all for taking care of our Evelyn!"

Their thunderous gratitude startled sparrows from the treetops.

The villagers gaped at the well-dressed city folk, unsure how to react.

Trembling, Victoria stepped forward, tears spilling over. "I'm Evelyn's mother. Thank you..."

Her voice broke. She could only bow deeply.

Evelyn gazed at the familiar faces as memories flooded back.

The scrawny girl from those days had finally returned—standing tall.
###Chapter 460

Evelyn Laurent's words sent shockwaves through White Rock Village.

"Birth mother? How dare you claim to be Evelyn's birth mother!"

"What kind of heartless parents would abandon their child like this?"

"Poor Evelyn was left in this impoverished backwater as a child!"

"And that wicked nanny abused her!"

The villagers erupted in angry accusations, their faces flushed with outrage.

Evelyn stepped forward urgently. "Uncle Zhang, Aunt Wang, you've misunderstood!"

"Vincent Lowell and Margaret Hill were my adoptive parents. They're the ones who abandoned me here."

"My real parents and brothers have always treated me well."

The villagers' expressions shifted to dawning realization and embarrassment.

"Our apologies. We spoke too hastily."

"We just couldn't bear seeing Evelyn wronged..."

Victoria Langley's eyes grew redder.

She gazed at these simple villagers with gratitude and sorrow.

Richard Langley gave a subtle signal to his bodyguards.

A dozen black-suited men sprang into action, unloading crates of supplies from vehicles.

"What's this..."

The villagers stood frozen in disbelief.

As the bodyguards distributed brand-new rice, flour, cooking oil, down jackets and other essentials door-to-door, everyone was stunned.

"This is too much!"

The white-haired Village Chief Zhang arrived breathlessly, gaping at the scene.

"Chief, this is our small token of appreciation."

"For taking care of our Evelyn all these years."

Victoria's voice trembled as she and her husband bowed deeply.

Her heart ached as she surveyed the dilapidated mountain village.

This was where her daughter had endured her hardest decade.

Yet perhaps compared to the torment in the Lowell household, this place had offered some solace?

After the distribution, Richard sought out Chief Zhang privately.

"We're investing fifty million to completely revitalize White Rock Village."

"This includes road paving and housing reconstruction."

"Given the abundant natural resources here, I plan to build a medicinal herb processing plant."

Chief Zhang's eyes widened, his gnarled hands trembling.

He could scarcely believe his ears.

What did this mean?

It meant young people wouldn't need to leave their homeland.

It meant White Rock Village would be reborn.

For the first time, hope kindled in the old man's clouded eyes.
###Chapter 461

Richard Langley's wrinkled hands trembled uncontrollably.

Tears welled in his clouded eyes as he clutched Ethan Sullivan's sleeve with desperate strength.

"Mr. Langley..."

The old man choked on his words, voice breaking.

Ethan gently patted his bony hand. "Uncle Zhang, White Rock Village deserves this."

Richard approached slowly, his face still pale.

"The Sullivan family will also fully support White Rock's development." His quiet voice carried unshakable conviction.

Zhang's knees buckled, nearly sending him to the ground.

"Don't!" Both men caught the elderly villager simultaneously.

Richard's throat worked. "If not for you all..."

He couldn't continue.

The image of Evelyn Laurent's battered body in that ravine flashed through his mind.

His knuckles turned white.

Ten years.

The mastermind still walked free.

The "accidents" that befell his six sons. Evelyn's disappearance. Sophia's switched identity.

No coincidences.

"Uncle Langley?"

Ethan sensed the sudden lethal aura radiating from the usually composed patriarch.

Richard snapped back to the present.

"Just remembering the past." He forced a strained smile.

Zhang wiped his eyes. "When that girl first arrived, there wasn't an inch of unbruised skin..."

The old man rambled about those painful memories.

"That stubborn child never cried when the village bullies tormented her. Just grabbed a stick and fought back..."

Ethan's knuckles whitened.

Dark currents swirled in Richard's eyes.

Both men listened in suffocating silence, chests weighed down by invisible stones.

Ethan glimpsed Richard's tension-hardened profile from the corner of his eye.

The legendary strategist of the Langley family now wore an expression that chilled the blood—was that... bloodlust?
###Chapter 462

Richard Langley's thoughts ran deeper than his composed exterior suggested.

Ethan Sullivan detected this with sharp intuition, his fingers absently tracing the rim of his teacup.

Only one matter could weigh so heavily on the Langley family patriarch.

The truth behind Evelyn Laurent's disappearance fifteen years ago.

Ethan's gaze darkened as he buried the speculation. That cold case involved too many powerful players—even the Langleys had spent years investigating.

As head of the Sullivan family, he understood these aristocratic undercurrents better than anyone.

"Bravo!"

Cheers suddenly erupted from the courtyard.

Ethan turned to see the six Langley brothers forming a semicircle.

Evelyn moved through her tai chi forms in flowing white robes, morning light glinting off her sleeves as sharp energy rippled through each motion.

Beside a stone table sat an elderly man with snow-white hair and youthful vitality.

Despite the winter chill, the old master wore only a thin white tunic, his complexion glowing with health.

"Excellent!" The elder clapped as Evelyn completed her sequence. "You haven't slacked off these six months."

She winked playfully. "I'd never neglect your teachings, Master."

Turning to the group, she announced, "This is Master Zhang Zheng Yi, my tai chi instructor."

"Zhang Zheng Yi?!"

Richard shot to his feet, his teacup shattering on the flagstones.

Ethan's pupils constricted.

The legendary grandmaster of ancient martial arts!

The tai chi patriarch who'd vanished fifteen years ago, rejecting discipleship requests from every prominent family.

Richard approached with a deep bow. "Master Zhang, this humble junior pays his respects."

"No formalities." The elder raised a hand. "Your daughter calls me teacher—we're equals here."

Evelyn stared in shock. Her father's hands trembled—she'd never seen him show such reverence.

Master Zhang stroked his beard, smiling fondly at Evelyn. "When I found this girl on Jade Peak, I knew she had rare martial talent."

The words struck Richard like thunder.

Jade Peak—

The very mountain where Evelyn had vanished.
###Chapter 463

Evelyn Laurent's eyes widened slightly as she watched Richard Langley and Zhang Zhengyi conversing.

"Dad, Master, you know each other?" she couldn't help asking.

Richard gave a slight bow, his tone respectful. "I've long admired the master's reputation."

He had wanted to meet Zhang Zhengyi before but never got the chance. Running into him here was an unexpected delight.

Evelyn blinked, her mind reeling.

Anyone who could command such deference from her father must be extraordinary.

Noticing his young disciple's shocked expression, Zhang chuckled and shook his head. "That's all in the past."

"Now I'm just an old man retired in White Stone Village. Practicing tai chi and teaching students."

When he took Evelyn as his disciple, it was precisely because he recognized her innate stubbornness and exceptional talent.

This seemingly delicate girl possessed astonishing explosive power.

Richard immediately understood. "Master needn't worry. Today's matter won't leave this place."

Zhang nodded approvingly, his gaze sweeping over those present before landing on Ethan Sullivan.

"Young man, come here." He beckoned.

Ethan stepped forward respectfully and bowed. "Master Zhang."

Zhang pinched his wrist, eyebrows lifting slightly. "Old Sun's disciple?"

"Indeed." Ethan bowed again.

"Not bad." Zhang released his hand and gave Evelyn a meaningful look. "Good enough for my girl."

Evelyn's cheeks flushed pink. "Master!"

"What?" Zhang stroked his beard. "The whole internet knows about this boy taking a bullet for you."

Evelyn's eyes widened in surprise. "You even know about that?"

Zhang pretended offense. "Do you think your master is some out-of-touch fossil?"

Evelyn stuck out her tongue. "Fine, I was wrong."

Laughter soon filled the courtyard.
###Chapter 464

Zhang Zhengyi held Evelyn Laurent's hand and chattered away until villagers came to call them for dinner.

The villagers had already returned home to prepare a feast for their distinguished guests from afar.

Village Chief Zhang approached with his cane, his wrinkled face tinged with nervousness. "Our village is humble, but this is our heartfelt hospitality. We hope you'll honor us."

He discreetly studied the well-dressed city folk, afraid of appearing inhospitable.

Richard Langley laughed warmly. "You're too kind, Chief."

They were ushered to the village square—a simple brick-paved clearing.

A large round table was laden with rustic dishes. Though the tableware was plain, each dish steamed with mouthwatering aromas.

Evelyn sat beside Zhang Zhengyi, while Ethan Sullivan quietly took the seat on her other side.

"Try this cured meat. I took it down from the rafters just for you," Zhang said, placing a glistening slice in Evelyn's bowl.

She took a bite, and the familiar flavor made her eyes sting.

After dinner, the villagers insisted they stay the night. Every household warmed their kang beds and laid out fresh bedding.

Richard lay on the toasty kang, listening to the occasional bark of dogs outside. A deep sense of peace settled over him.

No wonder such simple, kind people had raised a girl as gentle as Evelyn.

Curled up on the familiar kang, Evelyn drifted into sleep, wrapped in long-missed comfort.

At dawn, construction vehicles rumbled into the village.

Designers walked through with blueprints, stopping frequently to measure and take notes.

"The renovation will take three months," the foreman reported to Richard. "But the results will exceed your expectations."

Before leaving, Evelyn bid farewell to every household. Zhang Zhengyi pressed a cloth bundle into her hands, his eyes red. "For the road."

Inside were dried mountain delicacies, their faint fragrance lingering.

On the journey back, Ethan leaned against the seat with closed eyes. Evelyn noticed his pallor and gently took his hand.

"I'm fine," he murmured, opening his eyes to smile at her.

Her heart ached. She knew he had pushed himself to accompany her.

The neon lights of the capital came into view. As she watched the city glow, a thought struck her.

"The Lowells..."

"They left Harbor City long ago," Ethan said flatly. "The Sullivans control it now."

Evelyn nodded, asking no more.

When the car pulled into the Sullivan estate, Ethan finally succumbed to exhaustion, resting his head on her shoulder as sleep claimed him.
###Chapter 465

The festive spirit of New Year's Eve grew stronger in the city.

Lanterns hung high along the streets, and fresh spring couplets adorned every doorway. Evelyn Laurent stood by the floor-to-ceiling window of the Langley family mansion, watching snowflakes drift outside. Her fingertips traced the glass lightly.

This was her first New Year's celebration with the Langleys.

"Evelyn, come here!" Victoria Langley's voice called from the living room.

Evelyn turned to see the entire family waiting for her. The coffee table was piled with elegant gift boxes, each tied with red ribbons.

"These are your New Year's gifts." Nathaniel Langley handed her a thick red envelope. "And your lucky money."

Her fingers trembled slightly as she accepted it. Memories surfaced—previous years spent alone in her research dorm, her mentor boiling her a single bowl of dumplings before returning to work.

"Thank you..." Her voice caught.

The door opened, and Ethan Sullivan entered with Vincent Sullivan behind him. Uncharacteristically, Ethan wore a crimson cashmere coat that made his complexion appear even paler.

"Happy New Year." He approached Evelyn and drew a small velvet box from his pocket.

Inside lay an exquisite snowflake brooch. Silver filigree caught the light in delicate glimmers.

"Do you like it?" Ethan murmured.

Evelyn nodded, fingertips brushing the jewelry. She noticed the faint flush at the tips of his ears—clearly uncomfortable in such festive attire.

"It suits you," she whispered.

Fireworks suddenly exploded outside. Everyone moved to the balcony, where blossoms of light unfurled across the night sky.

Meanwhile, in a hospital room, Xander Quincy stood alone by the window. Bandages still wrapped his forehead as he stared blankly at distant fireworks.

His phone lit up with a message from Reginald Quincy: Happy New Year, Xander.

He didn't reply. Instead, he remembered years ago—Bianca Fairchild sneaking him out to watch fireworks, her laughter brighter than the sparks above them.

Boom—

Another firework burst open. Xander closed his eyes as silent tears fell.
###Chapter 466

Xander Quincy carried a bundle of fireworks, finding Bianca Fairchild curled up in a corner of the Quincy family estate.

The small girl hid behind a pile of discarded items, her slender frame trembling uncontrollably.

"Bianca!"

He knelt down, gently grasping her ice-cold hands.

Bianca lifted her tear-streaked face, relaxing slightly upon recognizing him.

"Brother...I'm scared..."

"Don't be afraid. I'll set off fireworks with you."

He led her to the courtyard and lit the first sparkler.

Golden sparks bloomed in the night, illuminating Bianca's awestruck face.

"Beautiful?"

"Mhm!"

She nodded vigorously, eyes shining like stars.

They spent half the night setting off fireworks until Bianca fell asleep in his arms.

"Brother, will you watch fireworks with me every year?"

The drowsy girl murmured before drifting off.

"Yes."

He made the solemn promise.

But later, he broke it.

Xander wiped away tears as he rose with his cane.

The nurse station clock showed 11:40 PM on New Year's Eve.

After signing discharge papers, he left the hospital without looking back.

His wheelchair crunched through fresh snow.

Though he didn't know Bianca's whereabouts, he resolved to search every city.

Fireworks illuminated Beverly Hills' night sky.

Evelyn Laurent twirled across the lawn with two sparklers.

Golden arcs traced her movements.

"Careful!"

Sebastian Langley called out, lighter in hand.

Ethan Sullivan leaned against a pillar, his camera following the joyful figure.

Click.

Another photograph captured Evelyn gazing skyward, fireworks reflected in her eyes.

"Evelyn! Family photo time!"

Theodore Langley announced.

The Langley family assembled quickly.

Victoria Langley suddenly pulled Ethan forward. "You two should join us."

Vincent Sullivan stood beside Richard Langley.

Ethan found himself beside Evelyn.

"Three, two, one—"

The camera immortalized the moment.

Against a backdrop of bursting fireworks stood a finally reunited family.
###Chapter 467

The Laurent household radiated joy this year.

The Sullivans were equally immersed in happiness.

In the family portrait frame, Ethan Sullivan gazed tenderly at Evelyn Laurent beside him, his affection overflowing.

New Year's Eve laughter lingered until dawn before reluctant farewells were exchanged.

For them, the holiday season offered rare moments of respite.

In their heritage, this celebration symbolized reunion and renewal.

When festivities ended, each would resume their separate journeys toward dreams.

Time flew like an arrow.

Three years vanished in a blink.

At Harvard University, Evelyn devoured knowledge voraciously.

She excelled academically while mastering new skills within the Laurent family.

Her natural talents were honed to perfection through relentless self-improvement.

Graduation season arrived quietly.

Timothy Gold's repeated invitations to variety shows were politely declined.

Her initial participation had been merely to humor Julian's insistence, not for fame.

Camera-shy by nature, she earned Timothy's respect—their friendship blossoming instead.

Ethan distinguished himself these three years.

Every spare moment was dedicated to showing Evelyn the world's wonders.

Brick by brick, her emotional walls crumbled before his patience.

Yet neither spoke the unspoken truth aloud.

Evelyn remained consumed by studies.

Ethan waited without urgency, his composure unwavering.

Before Harvard's grand gates...

"Evelyn! Graduation photos!" Lillian Rothschild waved enthusiastically, sunlight illuminating her smile amidst a cluster of gowned classmates.

"Coming."

Evelyn hurried over, her gown fluttering.

The camera shutter captured youth immortalized.

Their radiant smiles outshone the very sun in the photograph.

"Wait for me!" Isabella Valentine arrived breathless, shooting Lillian an accusatory glare. "You forgot me again!"

Lillian stuck out her tongue. "My bad."

After rearranging, they took countless group photos.

Evelyn felt a sudden surrealism.

Four years had passed since returning to Harvard—her undergraduate chapter closing.

"How time flies," she murmured softly.

Those years had sculpted the awkward girl into an elegant beauty.

Even without makeup, her brilliance was undeniable.

"Evelyn," Isabella interrupted her reverie, "has Rachel mentioned when she's returning?"
###Chapter 468

The airport terminal bustled with activity as the arrival announcement echoed through the speakers.

Evelyn Laurent stood by the arrival gate, absently tracing patterns on her phone screen. Isabella Valentine paced nearby, glancing up anxiously every few moments.

"Do you think she's changed?" Isabella suddenly asked.

Evelyn chuckled lightly. "Three years is a long time. People change."

Just then, a tall figure emerged from the corridor pushing a luggage cart. She wore aviators, her wavy hair cascading over her shoulders with effortless confidence.

"Rachel!" Isabella was the first to rush forward.

Rachel Clemenson removed her sunglasses, revealing a radiant smile. She opened her arms and pulled both friends into a tight embrace.

"I've missed you so much," she murmured, voice thick with emotion.

Ethan Sullivan stood a short distance away, politely taking charge of her luggage. Rachel's eyes flickered with surprise when she noticed him, then softened with understanding.

"Seems I've missed quite a lot."

Evelyn's ears turned pink as she cleared her throat. "Let's talk in the car."

During the drive back, Rachel gazed at the familiar cityscape through the window. "How's Grandma been?"

An uneasy silence filled the vehicle.

Evelyn and Isabella exchanged glances before Evelyn answered. "Not well. She was hospitalized again last week."

Rachel's fingers tightened around her seatbelt. "I'm staying for good this time."

As they passed through downtown, a massive digital billboard displayed financial news. The Quincy Group logo flashed across the screen.

Rachel's body went rigid.

The report mentioned the conglomerate's incoming CEO. When the camera panned across the board members, a familiar face appeared for a split second.

"Is that—" Isabella clapped a hand over her mouth.

Rachel's expression turned eerily calm. "Xander Quincy."

Evelyn watched her with concern. "Rachel..."

"I'm fine." Rachel turned with a faint smile. "That's all in the past."

Ethan's eyes met hers in the rearview mirror. "Xander's been overseas these past three years. He only recently returned to take over the family business."

Silence descended again.

When the car stopped at the hospital entrance, Rachel spoke softly. "Thank you for picking me up. I'd like to see Grandma alone first. We'll catch up later."

She stepped out, her posture perfectly composed. Evelyn moved to follow, but Ethan held her back.

"Give her space."

Isabella sighed. "I hope she's truly moved on."

Evelyn frowned at the hospital entrance. "Something tells me it's not that simple."

Her phone chimed abruptly with a text from an unknown number:

"Evelyn, long time no see. Heard Rachel's back? —Xander Quincy"
###Chapter 469

Isabella Valentine sat in the backseat, watching the couple in front with a sour expression.

She'd grown accustomed to being the third wheel over the past three years.

Evelyn Laurent shot Ethan Sullivan a glare. "Try skipping another board meeting."

Ethan chuckled, his fingers tapping the steering wheel.

Last month, he'd postponed a crucial meeting to pick her up from campus. Harrison Whitmore had stormed into the university in protest, threatening to resign if it happened again.

The CEO's personal assistant shouldn't have to keep fabricating excuses for delayed meetings.

One word from Evelyn had sent Ethan rushing back to the conference room.

The black Maybach glided to a stop outside the airport terminal.

Ethan circled to the passenger side, opening Evelyn's door. His fingers brushed her palm, drawing a faint blush to her ears.

A figure in stilettos came barreling down the VIP corridor.

"Evelyn! Isabella!"

Bianca Fairchild whipped off her aviators, her silver carry-on gleaming in the sunlight. She threw her arms open but froze half a step from Evelyn.

Ethan's icy stare sent shivers down her spine.

"You've changed," Ethan remarked, taking in the radiant woman who bore no resemblance to the timid girl from his memories.

Isabella linked arms with Bianca. "You're staying this time, right?"

"Of course." Bianca's red lips curved. "I've worked at every top research institute abroad. Time to serve my country." She winked. "And become the Valentine heiress's personal assistant."

As the group moved toward the exit, a shadow darted across the revolving doors.

"Bianca!"

Xander Quincy stood disheveled in the middle of the corridor, his suit wrinkled. He reached for Bianca's luggage, but she sidestepped smoothly.

The airport PA system announced flight delays.

Bianca stared at the man she hadn't seen in three years, her nails digging into her palms. The scar on his temple was from the car crash.

"Move." Her voice was glacial.

Xander pressed forward as if deaf. "I searched for you everywhere. Where did you go? Are you leaving again?"

His gaze flickered over the trio behind Bianca, flinching when it landed on Ethan.
###Chapter 470

The airport terminal buzzed with activity as the robotic female voice announced flight information over the PA system.

Bianca Fairchild emerged from the international arrivals gate, her scarlet lips curving slightly beneath designer sunglasses. Three years. She was finally back.

"Ranran!"

A hoarse male voice called out behind her.

Her steps faltered. The eyes behind those dark lenses narrowed to slits. She'd recognize that voice even in death.

Xander Quincy stumbled toward her, his tailored suit wrinkled and tie askew. His hand shot out to grab her wrist. "It's really you—"

"Move."

She wrenched her arm free with icy precision, removing her sunglasses. Those once-gentle eyes now held only glacial contempt. "You've mistaken me for someone else, sir."

Isabella Valentine stepped between them protectively. "Xander Quincy, what do you think you're doing?"

He froze. The woman before him wore a sharply tailored beige trench coat, her wavy hair cascading over shoulders, lips burning crimson. Her gaze held all the warmth of a stranger.

This wasn't the Bianca he remembered.

His Bianca had always kept her eyes downcast, dressed in muted dresses, speaking in hushed tones.

"Ranran..." His voice cracked. "I've searched for you three years—"

Evelyn Laurent shoved Ethan Sullivan's hand away, eyes flashing. "You tipped him off?"

Ethan raised both palms. "I swear it wasn't me!" He pulled out his phone. "Check my call logs."

Evelyn scanned the screen, shoulders relaxing marginally. She couldn't take risks—not when Bianca might be dragged back into that viper's nest of a Quincy family.

Bianca gently nudged Isabella aside, facing Xander squarely. She stood taller now, spine straight as a steel rod.

"Sir," she enunciated each syllable, "I don't know you. Step aside."

Xander's outstretched hand trembled midair. He searched her eyes desperately for any flicker of recognition, finding only indifference.

"Ranran..." He took another step, fingers grazing her coat sleeve.

In one fluid motion, Bianca seized his wrist and flipped him clean over her shoulder.

Thud.

The impact echoed through the terminal. Gasps rippled through the crowd.

She looked down at him, brushing nonexistent dust from her palms. "I said no touching."

Her quiet voice carried like a gunshot in the sudden silence.

Xander remained sprawled on the polished floor. Staring at the blinding overhead lights, he suddenly laughed—a broken sound with tears tracking down his temples.

This woman who fought back, who looked at him with frost in her gaze—was this really his Ranran?

His Ranran had been lost long ago. By his own hands.
###Chapter 471

With a swift judo throw, Xander Quincy crashed onto the cold pavement.

Bianca Fairchild didn't even glance back. She turned to Evelyn Laurent. "Let's go."

Xander lay motionless, staring blankly at her retreating figure.

Ethan Sullivan shook his head in pity before leaving. That look cut deeper than any blade.

Xander knew without doubt—she was Bianca.

But she had abandoned him.

Ethan's words echoed in his mind: You'll never win her heart.

Under the sunlight, Bianca radiated confidence and brilliance.

And him?

Three wasted years. Half the globe searched. Every lead vanished at the critical moment.

Then he spotted her at the airport upon returning.

She pretended not to know him.

The love in her eyes was gone.

"Brother? Why are you on the ground?" Beatrice Quincy's masked face twisted in disgust. "You...what happened to you?"

The disheveled man before her bore no resemblance to the proud Quincy heir.

He'd vanished abroad after his hospital discharge, barely contacting anyone. They'd only lured him back with family troubles.

Xander rose coldly. Disgust surged when he saw his sister. "What do you want?"

"Brother!" Beatrice reached for his arm, but he jerked away. "You never treated me like this before! What's so special about Bianca? She's beneath us!"

Her voice dropped to a hiss. "Think of the family's reputation."

"For my sake?" Xander sneered. "Or the Quincys'?"

Beatrice clenched her jaw, forcing concern. "Mother's ill. That's why we called you back. Clean yourself up before Father sees you like this."

Xander studied her until she shivered. Then he said flatly, "Lead the way."
###Chapter 472

Beatrice Quincy's shoulders finally relaxed when Xander Quincy gave in.

She was startled to realize how suffocating her rebellious second brother had become.

Who did he think he was?

Just wait until they faced their parents. She'd see how long he could keep up this act.

Beatrice watched his retreating figure with a mocking smirk.

Three years away from home for some irrelevant woman. Pathetic.

Outside the airport, Ethan Sullivan had been waiting for a while.

The black sedan glided smoothly toward Isabella Valentine's lab.

This state-of-the-art research facility, funded by the Valentines, had become one of the city's landmarks.

"What awful luck," Isabella grumbled as she got into the car. "Running into the Quincys."

Rachel Clemenson lowered her lashes, shadows flickering beneath her eyes.

"Aren't the Quincys practically bankrupt now?" Isabella tilted her head. "Calling Xander back at this point...could it be—"

Ethan's fingers tapped the steering wheel, his gaze icy. "Just using scraps."

Evelyn Laurent scoffed. "Trying to play the emotional card? Dream on."

She knew Reginald Quincy and his wife too well—treating their children like pawns.

"Disgusting," Isabella rolled her eyes.

Rachel suddenly let out a cold laugh. "To them, everyone except Beatrice is disposable."

Her nails dug into her palms. "Even Xander isn't an exception."

Her voice dropped.

"...Let alone..."

That boy who'd been rejected by his parents because of her.

Sunlight glinted off the lab's glass walls. Evelyn checked the time. "I need to head to the office. See you tonight at the usual spot."

Isabella winked. "Order my favorite lobster."

As the car door closed, Rachel watched the shrinking figure in the rearview mirror, dark emotions swirling in her eyes.
###Chapter 473

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the office. Evelyn Laurent was engrossed in reviewing the latest season's design proposals. Her fingers glided across the tablet screen, her expression shifting between thoughtful frowns and pleased smiles.

The timid girl from three years ago had undergone a complete transformation.

"Ms. Laurent, the Starlight Group's logo proposal requires your signature," her assistant reminded softly.

Evelyn took the document and signed it with swift precision. The silver bracelet on her wrist glimmered as it caught the light—a birthday gift from Ethan Sullivan last year.

Her phone vibrated. Seeing Ethan's name on the screen, her lips curved into an unconscious smile.

"The meeting was canceled?" she answered, amusement lacing her voice.

Ethan's deep voice resonated through the line. "Postponed until tomorrow. Should I come see you now?"

"No," she said firmly. "You should return to the office and prepare for tomorrow's meeting."

A resigned sigh came through the phone.

"I'll pick you up tonight," Ethan conceded. "Rachel's welcome dinner, remember?"

"Of course I remember," Evelyn chuckled. "Go on, Mr. Sullivan."

After hanging up, she gazed out the window. The rainy night three years ago still felt vivid—when she had huddled in the corner of her rented apartment, unable to imagine ever having a life like this.

Now, her design firm had gained recognition in the city, with an increasing stream of clients. Though it couldn't compare to Sullivan Group's scale, every project was built through her own hard work.

Her phone buzzed again. A message from Rachel: "See you tonight! Got a surprise for you~"

Evelyn arched a brow. Ever since studying abroad, her best friend had developed a penchant for unexpected antics.

What she didn't know was that at this very moment, on the top floor of Sullivan Group, Ethan was frowning at a table full of proposal plans.

"Too ordinary," he dismissed one stack of proposals. "I want something Evelyn will never forget."

His assistant wiped his brow. "Sir, Ms. Laurent prefers minimalist styles—"

"Revise it," Ethan cut him off, his gaze lingering on a photo of Evelyn on his screen.

The woman in the picture smiled radiantly, a far cry from the girl she had been three years ago. She had learned to manage a company, to navigate social intricacies—yet she still refused his marriage proposal.

With that thought, Ethan dialed Victoria Langley's number.

"Mrs. Langley, I plan to propose to Evelyn tonight," he said, an uncharacteristic tension in his voice.

A delighted gasp came through the line. "Wonderful! What do you need me to prepare?"

"Just your and Mr. Langley's presence," Ethan paused. "I'm afraid... she might refuse."

Victoria laughed. "Silly boy, that girl has had you in her heart for ages."

After hanging up, Ethan opened a special group chat. Its name had changed from "Evelyn's Guard" to "Princess Evelyn's Fan Club," marking his gradual acceptance back into the Langley family.

Taking a deep breath, he typed: "I'm proposing to Evelyn tonight."

The chat exploded instantly.

Richard Langley: "Finally came to your senses!"
Sebastian Langley: "Venue secured?"
Julian Langley: "Need a band? I know—"
Nathaniel Langley: "Booking a flight back now!"
Dominic Langley: "Don't mess this up."
Theodore Langley: "Should I arrange medical standby?"

Ethan smirked at the flood of messages. This time, he would make sure Evelyn became Mrs. Sullivan.

As night fell, Evelyn stepped out of her office building. Gazing at the starry sky, she suddenly remembered Ethan's words from three years ago:

"I'll wait for you—until the day you're ready to believe in me."

She had no idea the surprise awaiting her tonight would change everything.
###Chapter 474

Ethan Sullivan's phone screen kept lighting up.

Alexander Langley's message was concise and firm: "Time and place."

Sebastian Langley followed up: "Aren't you afraid Evelyn will chase you down?"

Julian Langley's warning carried affection: "Be careful with your proposal. Don't mess this up for our Evelyn!"

Nathaniel Langley's threat was blunt: "Should I order a coffin for you in advance?"

Dominic Langley's words held danger: "If you hurt Evelyn, I'm pulling the legal team."

Theodore Langley's reminder was gentle: "Ethan! Treat Evelyn right. Give her the perfect proposal, or all six of us will come after you."

Ethan smiled as the messages flooded the group chat.

Three years had passed, and he was now part of the Langley family.

The brothers had gone from hostility to acceptance, treating him like one of their own.

Everyone could see his unwavering devotion to Evelyn.

But that oblivious woman still hadn't caught on.

Or maybe she just refused to.

The group chat buzzed with more messages—some practical, some absurd.

Ethan chuckled, warmth in his eyes.

He pocketed his phone and slid into his car.

The proposal venue needed to be set up immediately.

Though he'd rehearsed this moment a thousand times in his head.

And the ring had been ready for months.

Yet his palms were damp with nerves.

Would Evelyn say yes?

Or would she—

No matter what, he had to take the chance.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was buried in paperwork at her office.

When she finally looked up, dusk had settled outside.

She rubbed her stiff neck and checked the clock—6 p.m.

Her phone screen was blank.

No new messages.

No usual check-in.

She frowned.

Ethan always texted her by this time.

Today, silence.

"Still in that international meeting?"

Muttering to herself, she packed up for her dinner reservation.

She was hosting the two partners from Symphony Heights at seven.

The elevator descended to the parking garage.

His Rolls-Royce wasn't waiting in its usual spot.

Evelyn stared at the empty space, unease prickling her chest.

She opened their chat.

The last message was from yesterday.

A strange ache tightened in her ribs.

She shoved her phone back into her bag.

Habits were dangerous.

She couldn't rely on anyone.

Not even Ethan.

Twenty minutes later, her car pulled up to Symphony Heights.

The restaurant was unusually quiet tonight.

No piano music drifted through the air.

She pushed open the door without a second thought.

Inside Symphony Heights—

"She's here!"

"Get ready!"

"The moment she steps in—"

"Focus!"

"Wait—where's Ethan?!"
###Chapter 475

The lights at Symphony Heights suddenly went dark.

A burst of static crackled through Isabella Valentine's walkie-talkie. "Mr. Sullivan hasn't arrived!"

"What?" She shot to her feet, nails digging into her palms.

The proposal team erupted into chaos.

Julian Langley was the first to pull out his phone, fingers trembling as he dialed. A robotic female voice answered: "The number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."

"Impossible!" Oliver Valentine snatched the phone. "He said he had a surprise for Evelyn this afternoon."

The pianist's hands hovered over the keys, eyes darting toward the entrance.

"Keep playing," Isabella ordered through gritted teeth. "Buy us time."

At the end of the rose-petal carpet, the elevator doors slid open.

Evelyn Laurent stepped into the scattered light, her heels crushing petals. She glanced around and smirked. "Someone's getting proposed to today?"

"Y-yes," Lillian Rothschild forced a smile as she approached. "Rumor says a trust fund kid rented the place."

The chandelier blazed to life.

Evelyn squinted at the half-hidden proposal sign—"Marry Me" flickering in the shadows.

"You..." Her gaze swept over their frozen expressions. "Waiting for someone?"

Lillian's champagne flute tilted, spilling crimson across the white tablecloth.

"Where's Ethan Sullivan?" Evelyn's voice turned glacial.

In the surveillance room, Harrison Whitmore stared at the monitors, face ashen. The last footage showed Ethan's car vanishing on the East Overpass, GPS signal lost.

"Pull all traffic cams along that route," Julian slammed the console. "I want him found—alive or dead."

The piano melody played on, its cheerfulness now grotesque.

Evelyn stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her phone screen lighting up with the seventeenth unanswered call before going dark again. The reflection showed her eyes like shards of ice.

"Keep searching." Her gown sent tableware crashing as she turned. "Tear this city apart if you have to."

Outside, police lights sliced through the night. No one noticed the security camera on the rooftop stairwell had been turned to face the wall—sometime before the chaos began.
###Chapter 476

The dinner party ended with fading laughter as guests bid their farewells.

Evelyn Laurent checked her phone again.

The screen remained blank.

Ethan Sullivan's chat window glared back at her in silence.

He had promised to pick her up.

Was the international conference still keeping him?

Her knuckles turned white as she clenched the device.

A black Rolls-Royce glided to a stop before her.

The window lowered, revealing Julian Langley's striking profile.

"Get in. I'll drive you home."

The light in Evelyn's eyes dimmed instantly.

"Why you?"

She opened the car door, unable to mask her disappointment.

Julian clutched his chest dramatically. "Little sister finds me lacking? Should I leave then?"

His Oscar-worthy performance materialized on command.

Evelyn shook her head with a sigh. "That's not what I meant."

She fastened her seatbelt while stealing glances out the window.

Julian's grip tightened on the steering wheel.

Harrison Whitmore's investigation results had unsettled him.

Ethan's discarded phone had been found in the east suburban brush.

But the man himself had vanished.

More disturbingly, surveillance only captured him leaving the office.

After that - complete disappearance.

"Third brother!"

Evelyn called for the third time.

Julian snapped back to attention. "Hmm?"

"You're acting strange tonight." Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "What's really going on?"

"Just struggling with a difficult role." His forced chuckle accompanied a press on the accelerator.

Evelyn studied his tense profile.

The excuse rang hollow.

What was her third brother hiding?
###Chapter 477

Julian Langley took a deep breath, forcing himself to shift his focus away from Ethan Sullivan's situation.

The steering wheel grew warm beneath his palms.

"Third brother?" Evelyn Laurent's voice suddenly broke the silence in the car.

Julian's fingers twitched imperceptibly. He turned his head slightly, feigning mild confusion. "Hmm?"

"Are you hiding something from me?" Evelyn's gaze pierced through him.

The Oscar-winning actor's skills were in full play. Julian chuckled lightly and shook his head. "What could I possibly be hiding?"

A brief silence settled between them.

Evelyn studied him for a long moment before finally leaning back into her seat and closing her eyes.

Julian's back was drenched in sweat.

The lights of Beverly Hills glowed warmly against the dark sky.

"Evelyn?" Victoria Langley immediately noticed her daughter's unusual demeanor and stepped forward. "You look pale. What's wrong?"

She shot Julian a sharp glare. "Did you upset your sister again?"

"Mom!" Julian protested with exaggerated innocence. "I wouldn't dare!"

Evelyn forced a weak smile. "Just tired from the outing. I'm going upstairs to rest."

Victoria's eyes followed her daughter until the bedroom door clicked shut. Then she turned back to her son. "What's really going on?"

Julian swallowed hard, lowering his voice. "Mom, something's happened."

"Ethan is missing."

Victoria clapped a hand over her mouth, her pupils dilating in shock.

"Evelyn doesn't know about the proposal," Julian added quickly. "We lost contact with him during the preparations. His phone was found in the east suburbs."

"Both our teams are reviewing surveillance footage now."

Victoria's hands trembled slightly. "How could this—"

"That guy's sharper than a fox," Julian said with forced lightness. "He'll be fine."

Upstairs, in her bedroom, Evelyn stood by the window, her fingers absently tapping against the frame.

Her phone screen flickered on and off.

She opened her chat with Ethan and sent a question mark.

No reply.

"Is your meeting still going?" she typed another message.

Only the ticking of the clock answered her in the silent room.

The sound of running water filled the bathroom.

Hot water cascaded over her skin but couldn't wash away the inexplicable unease in her chest.

Amid the roar of the hairdryer, Evelyn checked her phone for the third time.

Still nothing.
###Chapter 478

The phone screen flickered before going dark. Evelyn Laurent stared at the words "Power Off," her fingertips trembling.

"How could this..."

She threw off the covers and stepped barefoot onto the cold floor.

Her nightgown fluttered as she rushed down the stairs in urgent strides.

In the living room, Julian Langley was whispering with Victoria Langley.

"Julian!"

Evelyn's voice sliced through the air like a blade.

Julian turned to see his younger sister standing at the stairway, her disheveled hair framing her face, her ankles pale under the light.

"Where's Ethan Sullivan?"

Julian swallowed hard. "Probably at home..."

"His phone is off." Evelyn held up her device, the call log burning her eyes. "What's really going on?"

The air grew heavy with silence.

"Harrison said..." Julian spoke with difficulty, "Ethan went missing after leaving the office this afternoon."

Evelyn's pupils contracted sharply.

"His phone was found in the east suburbs." Julian's voice dropped lower. "But he..."

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

"When did this happen?"

"Three this afternoon..."

A sudden realization flashed in her sharp gaze. "You were at Symphony Heights?"

Julian's expression changed.

So that was it.

The proposal venue.

The carefully planned surprise.

That's why everyone kept it from her.

Evelyn's chest heaved violently as she spun around and dashed upstairs.

"Evelyn!" Julian called after her. "We've already sent people to search!"

His only answer was the deafening slam of a door.

In her bedroom, Evelyn grabbed a jacket and pulled it on.

Her fingers brushed against the photo frame on the nightstand—a picture of her and Ethan at an amusement park, him offering her cotton candy.

The glass suddenly blurred.

She wiped her eyes fiercely and retrieved a car key from the depths of a drawer.

Outside, the night stretched like spilled ink.
###Chapter 479

Julian Langley and Victoria Langley paced restlessly across the living room, their footsteps chaotic and uneven.

Richard Langley emerged from his study, drawn by the commotion. His sharp gaze lingered on Victoria's worried face before shifting to Julian. "What's going on?"

Under his father's piercing stare, Julian quickly recounted the situation.

Richard's frown deepened with every word. When Julian finished, he simply said, "I see."

He took Victoria's hand, his voice gentle. "Don't worry. Leave it to us."

Victoria's eyes brimmed with anxiety. "But Evelyn—"

"Do you really think Evelyn needs our concern?"

Richard's pointed question made Victoria pause.

She scratched her head. "Well... I suppose not."

Their daughter had always been one to settle scores.

Over the past four years, Evelyn Laurent's extraordinary intellect and sharp instincts had become the norm in their household.

She was brilliant, never one to act on emotion.

A sudden realization struck Victoria.

If someone dared to kidnap Ethan Sullivan, the real victims would be the kidnappers themselves...

Victoria bit her lip.

She abruptly stood. "No, I need to remind Evelyn."

At her daughter's door, she knocked lightly. "Evelyn, remember—show mercy!"

"We live in a society with laws..."

Inside, Evelyn rolled her eyes at her mother's words.

She raised her voice in response. "Mom, I know my limits!"

Only then did Victoria relax.

Perhaps she was overthinking it. Neither Evelyn nor Ethan were pushovers.

Worry had clouded her judgment.

With that realization, Victoria finally retreated to her room.

Meanwhile, inside her bedroom—

Evelyn's icy gaze remained fixed on her laptop screen.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she coordinated with Harrison Whitmore and other contacts, scouring every lead for Ethan's whereabouts.

This disappearance was unlike any other.

Ethan had vanished without a trace.

All night, Evelyn had combed through surveillance footage, only finding images of him leaving Sullivan Corporation before the trail went cold.

She rested her chin on her hand, deep in thought.

Despite the sleepless night, exhaustion never touched her.

She dialed Harrison again, pressing for details about Ethan's behavior before the disappearance and any unusual activity at Sullivan Corporation.

The answer remained the same—nothing out of the ordinary.

The only notable detail was that Ethan had been preparing a proposal.

But Evelyn knew better. He would never disappear for that reason.

Not when he'd been anticipating this moment for so long.

Ethan's sudden absence hung over them all like a storm cloud.
###Chapter 480

Evelyn Laurent was reviewing documents sent by Harrison when her phone rang abruptly.

"We found Ethan Sullivan!"

Theodore Langley's voice came through the receiver, hoarse from sleep deprivation.

The surveillance footage showed Ethan's last known location—the east suburbs. He had entered a black sedan, and the license plate was quickly identified.

"The car is registered to Xander Quincy."

Evelyn tapped her fingers lightly on the desk, her gaze turning icy.

Xander's return to the country was too coincidental.

Ethan's disappearance was even more suspicious.

She hung up, knocking over her coffee cup as she stood. The dark liquid spread across the files like dried blood.

"Evelyn?"

Victoria Langley's voice drifted up from downstairs.

Evelyn grabbed her coat and rushed down the steps. She snatched a custard bun from the breakfast tray, taking a large bite.

"I'm going to the Quincy estate."

Richard Langley set down his newspaper, his eyes sharp. "Do you need backup?"

"No." She was already at the door. "I'll handle this alone."

The door slammed shut behind her.

Victoria watched the swaying curtain, murmuring, "That girl..."

"Let her go." Richard picked up his teacup. "The Quincys have crossed the line this time."

For three years, the Quincy family had been in decline.

First, Bianca Fairchild's scandalous revelations before leaving the country sent their stock prices plummeting. Then Beatrice Quincy was forced to retire from acting. The combined pressure from the Langley and Sullivan families had left them struggling.

"They're desperate now," Victoria said coldly.

Richard stood, straightening his suit sleeves. "I'm heading to the office."

"Time to strike?"

"If they broke the rules first," Richard's eyes were razor-sharp, "then we won't hold back."

Evelyn's car screeched to a halt in front of the Quincy mansion.

She looked up at the once-opulent estate, now exuding an air of decay. The peeling paint on the wrought-iron gates mirrored the family's decline.

"Xander Quincy." She whispered the name, her fingers digging into her palms.

If Ethan had so much as a scratch...

She strode forward and pressed the doorbell.
###Chapter 481

The divine sword gleamed coldly under the moonlight.

Kaito's owl form staggered, its feathers soaked in blood.

The remaining three heads of the eight-headed serpent hissed, venom sizzling as it corroded the ground.

"Impossible..." Abe's voice trembled.

His fingers dug into his palms as he stared at Kaito.

The spectral serpent behind him writhed, black smoke rising from its five severed heads.

Kaito's sword tip wavered slightly.

His soul energy was nearly depleted, yet he stood tall.

"Again!"

With a fierce cry, the divine blade sliced through the night, aiming for the sixth head.

Abe stumbled back in panic.

A horrifying realization struck him—

This man was more terrifying than the legendary storm god.

"Boom!"

The serpent's tail lashed out, splitting the earth.

Kaito dodged nimbly, but his blade never faltered.

"Thud—"

Another head thudded to the ground.

Abe's face turned deathly pale.

His peripheral vision caught the distant battlefield, and his pupils constricted.

Kurozawa's corpse lay motionless in a pool of blood.

The young warrior from the eastern lands was driving Izanagi into retreat.

"It's over..."

Abe's throat bobbed.

He spun on his heel and bolted down the mountain.

"Running?"

Kaito's voice rang out sharply.

The serpent suddenly went berserk, all three heads spewing venom.

Kaito had no choice but to raise his sword in defense.

That split-second delay was all Abe needed to vanish into the night.

"Damn it!"

Kaito gritted his teeth.

He turned his murderous gaze back to the defiant serpent.

"Then I'll finish you first!"

The divine sword blazed with its final, radiant light.

That night,

The bloodshed atop the mountain stained half the sky crimson.
###Chapter 482

Beatrice Quincy's voice feigned composure on the phone. Evelyn Laurent's lips curled into a cold smile.

She ended the call decisively. Her stilettos clicked sharply against the marble floor.

The receptionist trailed behind her nervously, eagerly pressing the elevator button.

In the penthouse office, Beatrice shot up from her leather chair.

Her fists clenched. Nails dug deep into her palms.

"Why is Evelyn Laurent coming to see me all of a sudden?"

She paced back and forth. A sheen of sweat formed on her forehead.

The elevator dinged as it reached the top floor.

When that familiar figure appeared at the end of the hallway, Beatrice's heart nearly leaped out of her chest.

"Evelyn Laurent, what do you want?"

She forced a commanding tone, but her voice trembled uncontrollably.

Evelyn didn't bother with pleasantries. She cut straight to the chase. "Where is Xander Quincy?"

"My brother?" Beatrice's pupils constricted. "He's at home, of course. He never gets involved with company matters—"

Before she could finish, Evelyn's sharp gaze pierced through her.

Those eyes were like daggers. Beatrice's back instantly soaked with sweat.

"It's... it's true," she stammered. "He's been recuperating at home since returning from abroad..."

Evelyn suddenly let out a soft laugh.

The sound sent chills down Beatrice's spine.

"Then let me ask you this." Evelyn adjusted her gloves leisurely. "Where is Ethan Sullivan?"

"Ethan Sullivan?" Beatrice looked genuinely confused. "What does he have to do with our family?"

A sudden realization struck her. Her eyes flashed with malicious glee.

Had something happened to Ethan Sullivan?

The thought nearly made her laugh out loud.

She hoped he'd disappear forever!

Before she could hide the venom in her eyes, she met Evelyn's mocking gaze.

"Beatrice." Evelyn's voice was soft. "You're so pitifully stupid."

She took a step forward.

Beatrice scrambled backward until her waist hit the desk.

"Stay back!" She grabbed a letter opener from the desk. "There are cameras here! Security will be here any second!"

Evelyn ignored her, continuing her advance.

With each step, Beatrice trembled harder.

"One last time." Evelyn's voice was ice-cold. "Where are Xander Quincy and Ethan Sullivan?"

The letter opener clattered to the floor.

Beatrice's legs gave out. She slid down the desk, collapsing onto the ground.

"I... I really don't know..."
###Chapter 483

Beatrice Quincy's office door was kicked open with a violent crash.

Evelyn Laurent strode in with measured steps, the hem of her black trench coat flaring like a panther ready to strike.

"You—" Beatrice scrambled up from behind her desk, her wineglass slipping from her fingers and staining the cashmere rug crimson.

Evelyn seized her wrist.

"Ah!" Beatrice cried out as the bones creaked under the pressure.

"Evelyn, have you lost your mind? This is Quincy Enterprises!" Beatrice thrashed, her carefully styled curls now tangled against her face.

Ignoring her, Evelyn dragged her toward the exit.

"Help! Security!" Beatrice's shrieks echoed down the hallway.

A dozen guards rushed in, stun guns gleaming.

"Release Ms. Quincy!" the lead guard barked.

Evelyn smirked, pinning Beatrice against the wall with one hand while drawing a butterfly knife from her coat with the other.

The blade traced a cold arc under the lights.

"Tell Reginald Quincy," she whispered into Beatrice's ear, her voice deceptively soft, "if he dares lay a finger on Ethan Sullivan again—"

The tip of the knife grazed Beatrice's throat, leaving a thin red line.

"—I'll make sure he buries his own child."

Beatrice trembled, the scent of expensive perfume mingling with cold sweat.

Evelyn sheathed the knife and abruptly gripped Beatrice's chin. "Your brother's number."

With shaking hands, Beatrice recited the digits.

The moment Evelyn turned away, Beatrice's face twisted into something vicious.

"Kill her!"

The electric hum of stun guns filled the air.

Without looking back, Evelyn sidestepped the attack, her coat flaring to reveal the glint of steel at her waist.

Bang!

The first guard was sent flying, shattering a glass display case three meters away.

Before the others could react, they watched their comrades drop one by one.

Evelyn planted her boot on the last guard's chest and picked up a fallen stun gun.

"Seems Ms. Quincy has a poor memory."

In a flash, the weapon was pressed to Beatrice's throat.

"N-not my orders..." Beatrice collapsed, her makeup smeared.

Evelyn looked down at her, then smiled—a chilling sight.

"Next time, it'll be your eyes."

She turned toward the elevator as Beatrice's sobs echoed behind her.

As the doors closed, Evelyn pulled out her phone and dialed the number she'd just memorized.

"Xander Quincy. We need to talk."
###Chapter 484

Evelyn Laurent moved like lightning, closing the distance to Beatrice Quincy in an instant.

Her stun gun gleamed coldly as she pressed it against Beatrice's abdomen without hesitation.

The current activated immediately.

"Aaaah—"

A piercing scream tore through the air.

Beatrice convulsed violently before collapsing like a beached fish.

A dark stain spread rapidly beneath her.

Her eyes rolled back, limbs twitching uncontrollably—even basic bodily functions failed her.

Evelyn watched dispassionately before tossing the stun gun aside.

She turned toward the elevator, her retreating figure resolute.

This hadn't been part of her plan.

But Beatrice had crossed the line by ordering security to attack her.

Self-defense was justified.

Reginald Quincy would receive this warning loud and clear.

Security guards shrank back as she exited the Quincy building.

No one dared block the path of this avenging fury.

Standing in the sunlight, Evelyn dialed Xander Quincy's number.

"The number you have reached is currently unavailable..."

The automated message repeated.

Her eyes narrowed.

Ethan Sullivan's disappearance definitely involved the Quincys.

Xander's role remained unclear—for now.

But the Quincy family would pay.

Thirty minutes later.

Beatrice awoke to the acrid stench of urine.

Disoriented, she found herself sprawled on the cold floor.

Memory flooded back.

Her entire body trembled at the remembered agony of electricity coursing through her.

When she saw the dark stain beneath her, her face contorted.

"Evelyn Laurent!"

Her shriek echoed through the empty hallway.

Stumbling into the bathroom, she scrubbed her skin raw.

Water couldn't wash away the humiliation—or the bone-deep hatred.

With shaking hands, she called Reginald Quincy.

"Father! That insane woman Evelyn—"

Sobs choked her explanation.

A teacup shattered on the other end.

"Call the police! Now!" Reginald roared.

"We can't... our men attacked first..."

Beatrice hiccuped through the explanation.

After a weighted pause, Reginald's voice turned icy. "Return home immediately. She won't breach the mansion's security."

Hanging up, he stared at the night beyond his window with a cold smile.

Ethan's disappearance had clearly rattled Evelyn.

This game was just beginning.
###Chapter 485

Reginald Quincy comforted Beatrice for a long time before her sobs subsided.

She quickly changed into clean clothes and ordered her secretary to restore the office to its original state. Then she hurriedly left the Beverly Hills complex.

Though the Quincy family owned property in Beverly Hills, they never resided there.

Especially recently—they wouldn’t dare set foot in the area.

Only the Laurent and Sullivan families lived in Beverly Hills year-round.

Would Reginald willingly walk into a trap?

He immediately dispatched elite bodyguards to escort Beatrice to the second most prestigious residential district in the city—Monarch Heights.

She was his only precious daughter. He couldn’t afford even the slightest mishap.

Evelyn Laurent had actually dared to lay hands on Beatrice!

The mere thought of it made Reginald’s blood boil.

This time, he would ensure Beatrice was heavily guarded. Let’s see what tricks Evelyn could pull then!

But for now, he had more pressing matters to attend to.

A cold smirk curled on Reginald’s lips.

He rose slowly.

The dimly lit hall was shrouded in heavy curtains that blocked out all natural light. Even with the lamps on, the air remained thick with suffocating tension.

With measured steps, Reginald walked toward the room at the end of the corridor.

"Mr. Sullivan, have you made your decision?"

Pushing the door open, he fixed a cold stare on the man inside.

The windowless chamber was illuminated only by a single dim wall lamp. At the simple table sat a man with an impassive expression.

Hearing the question, the man lifted his gaze, his eyes eerily calm.

"What exactly do you wish for me to consider, Uncle Quincy?"

It was Ethan Sullivan, who had been missing for days.

Outwardly composed, his mind was a tempest of turmoil.

Reginald had ruined his proposal plans.

The moment that should have been him kneeling before Evelyn with a ring had been stolen by Reginald’s underhanded tactics.

It all began with Xander Quincy’s invitation.

Ethan had gone without suspicion. After three years apart, catching up seemed natural.

But the moment they drank tea, both collapsed unconscious.

Reginald had drugged the tea and secretly imprisoned Ethan in this villa’s basement.

Xander was locked in the adjacent room.

The drug’s effects lingered, leaving Ethan weak and powerless.

His phone was gone—likely discarded.

"Ethan, your composure is truly admirable." Reginald clapped slowly, his eyes glinting with malice. "Even now, you’re still playing dumb with me?"

His voice dripped with icy venom. "Do you truly not know what I want?"

The memory of the Laurent and Sullivan families’ joint suppression over the past three years, along with the Valentines’ cold indifference, stoked Reginald’s fury.

As one of the four great families, the Quincys had been treated like discarded pawns—utterly defenseless!
###Chapter 486

The Quincy Group headquarters stood desolate under the sunset.

Three years of joint suppression from the Sullivan and Lowell families, coupled with the Quincy family's own ruined reputation, had shrunk their market share to a precarious level.

"I don't know."

Ethan Sullivan lounged lazily in his chair, fingers tapping the armrest. Even weakened by sedatives, he maintained the composure of a man in power.

Reginald Quincy's veins bulged as he slammed a contract onto the table.

"You expect me to believe the Sullivan Group's relentless attacks on Quincy Holdings happened without your knowledge?" His voice was icy. "You're in my hands now. Cooperate."

The contract clearly stated: Sullivan Group's investment in Quincy Holdings, including the transfer of the North Suburbs development project.

This prime location should have gone to the Lowells.

Ethan glanced at the document and chuckled darkly.

"Uncle Reginald, your appetite is impressive."

He tilted his head slightly, a glint of steel in his eyes. Despite his predicament, that gaze sent a chill down Reginald's spine.

"How much liquid capital does Quincy Holdings have left?"

The question struck a nerve.

Reginald's face darkened. "The Sullivans cover 70% of construction costs."

Ethan laughed outright, his smirk sharpening.

"Why don't I just complete the project myself and slap your logo on it?"

He adjusted his wristwatch deliberately, each movement dripping with disdain for the other man's greed.

Reginald snatched up the inkpad.

"You're signing this today—willing or not!"

He lunged forward but froze at Ethan's next words.

"Found your construction suppliers yet?" Ethan lifted his gaze. "Or were you planning to cut corners with subpar materials?"

Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting stark shadows across his face. The captive somehow held all the power.
###Chapter 487

Reginald Quincy slammed the contract onto the desk. The metal corner screeched against the paper.

"Ethan Sullivan, do you think this charade will fool anyone?"

His bloodshot eyes locked onto the composed young man across from him. His knuckles turned white from gripping the edge.

Outside, the storm raged. Rain lashed against the windows like the Quincy family's three-year struggle under the joint pressure of the Lowells and Sullivans.

Ethan adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate calm. A faint smirk played on his lips. "You misunderstand me, Uncle Reginald."

His gaze sharpened like a blade. "I'm merely doing the math for you."

"The Wu Village project requires at least two billion in liquid assets. The Quincy Group can barely scrape together five hundred million right now, can it?"

Reginald's face paled.

Ethan continued, "Not to mention your construction factories failed formaldehyde inspections last year. You've lost bidding privileges altogether."

He leaned forward suddenly, his voice a venomous whisper. "Are you trying to drag the entire Quincy family down with me?"

A cold sweat broke on Reginald's forehead.

He knew this project was toxic. But the Quincys had run out of options.

"Enough threats!" He shoved a new document across the table. "Sign this, and I'll guarantee your safe departure."

Ethan glanced at the papers and laughed. The sound cut through the tense room.

"Uncle, have you forgotten?" He flicked the document dismissively. "I hold no Sullivan Group shares. This transfer agreement isn't even worth the paper it's printed on."

Reginald's face drained of color.

He'd overlooked one crucial detail—the Sullivan patriarch had never given his son real power.

The rain intensified. Only their labored breaths filled the silence.

Ethan stood abruptly, looking down at the older man. "You kidnapped the wrong person."

He straightened his tie with slow precision. "The one who truly controls Sullivan Group's fate is my recently returned sister."

Reginald's pupils contracted.

The realization struck him like lightning—his meticulously laid trap had targeted the wrong prey from the very beginning.
###Chapter 488

Ethan Sullivan, CEO of Sullivan Group, owns zero shares in his own company?

Reginald Quincy's knuckles turned white as he gripped the tablet.

His venomous gaze bore into the young man before him.

"Ethan, do you take me for a fool?"

Ethan lounged lazily on the leather sofa, long fingers tapping the armrest.

"Don't believe me, Uncle Reginald?"

A faint smirk played on his lips. "Check for yourself."

Reginald slammed the tablet onto the table.

The screen lit up, revealing an unmistakable shareholder structure.

Evelyn Laurent's name topped the list with a 35% stake—five points higher than Vincent Sullivan's.

Ethan's name was conspicuously absent.

"Fascinating."

Ethan savored Reginald's ashen expression. "Convinced now?"

Reginald's chest heaved with rage.

His meticulously planned kidnapping had netted him a figurehead CEO?

"One billion."

He ground his teeth. "Wire it now."

Ethan spread his hands in mock regret. "I don't even have a hundred bucks."

"My wife controls all the money."

His innocent smile didn't reach his eyes. "I'm just a kept man these days."

Reginald snatched up a crystal ashtray.

His arm froze mid-swing.

A chilling realization struck him—

This young wolf wasn't afraid. Not one bit.

"Keep me as long as you like, Uncle."

Ethan stretched luxuriously. "I could use the paid vacation."

Reginald trembled with fury.

This wasn't a hostage.

He'd brought home a damn crown prince!

"You think I won't hurt you?"

He loomed closer, voice dripping menace.

Ethan's gaze turned glacial.

"Uncle Reginald."

He adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate slowness. "Are you sure you want this fight?"

The air crystallized.

Reginald suddenly remembered the rumors—

How Ethan had single-handedly dismantled an underground casino that rainy night.

He took an involuntary step back.

"Get out!"

Reginald's roar shook the room.

Ethan rose gracefully, pausing at the door.

"Oh, Uncle?"

His smile held knives. "How's your son doing in Macau? Heard he's been... unlucky."

Watching Reginald's face drain of color,

Ethan whistled a cheerful tune as he left.

The game had only just begun.
###Chapter 489

Reginald Quincy's knuckles turned white as he clenched his fists, veins bulging across his hands. His glare burned into Ethan Sullivan's unshakable composure.

"Let you go? In your dreams!"

He whirled around, slamming the door with a deafening crash.

The smirk froze on Ethan's lips.

A glacial glint flashed in his eyes.

The Quincy family had played their hand ruthlessly this time.

Even using their own son as bait.

Ethan flexed his fingers experimentally. The sedative was stronger than anticipated.

He needed to regain his strength quickly.

The sound of shattering glass erupted from next door.

Xander Quincy's hysterical roar followed. "Father! Have you lost your mind?"

Reginald stormed in, his face thunderous.

Xander slumped in his chair, eyes bloodshot. "You set me up too?"

"Silence!" Reginald seized his chin. "Remember your last name!"

Xander suddenly laughed. "The Quincy family should've collapsed long ago."

"You ungrateful brat!" Reginald backhanded him across the face.

Blood trickled from Xander's split lip.

He licked the crimson stain, his gaze mocking. "You think kidnapping Ethan will save you?"

Reginald yanked him up by the collar. "The Lowells will surrender soon enough."

Xander glanced out the window. "You have no idea who you're dealing with."

Ethan listened to the commotion next door, his fingertips twitching faintly.

He had to escape before Evelyn Laurent discovered his absence.

The engagement ring in his breast pocket pressed uncomfortably against his chest.

Reginald would never expect—

This kidnapping would become the final straw that crushed the Quincy empire.
###Chapter 490

"How dare you show your face after the Quincy family has been crushed by the Laurents and Sullivans?"

Reginald Quincy slammed his palm on the mahogany desk, rattling the teacups. His burning gaze locked onto his son, whom he hadn't seen in three years.

"How many times did I reach out? Yet you abandoned us for that worthless woman!"

Xander Quincy kept his eyes downcast, fingers trembling slightly. The word "worthless" cut through him like a blade.

"Bianca was just a Luck Charmer, yet you treated her like treasure!" Reginald's voice rose, veins bulging at his temples. "If she hadn't run away, our family wouldn't be in ruins!"

The venomous words made Xander look up. His father's twisted expression was unrecognizable—as if possessed by something sinister.

"When I find her..." Reginald licked his lips, smiling in a way that chilled the blood. "I'll make sure she suffers beyond imagination."

A cold dread seeped into Xander's bones. Was this greedy, raving man truly the stern patriarch he remembered?

Obsession. Superstition. A rabid hunger for power. These traits had consumed Reginald whole.

"Speak!" Reginald kicked over the coffee table. "You'd choose some outsider over your own father?"

Amid the shattering glass, Xander remained silent. He suddenly recalled Ethan Sullivan's calm eyes in captivity, his heart squeezing violently.

Too late.
The realization had come too late.

His mother's illness. The family crisis. All lies. What his father truly craved was the thrill of absolute control.

Seeing his son's defiance, Reginald stormed out, his furious footsteps echoing down the hall.

"Ethan..." Xander whispered, nails digging into his palms. He would get him out. Even if—

The thought twisted his lips into a bitter smile.

Meanwhile, Reginald paced his study like a caged beast. With Ethan as leverage, he could bleed the Sullivans dry.

"Bankrupt? Impossible!" He tore through drawers before sweeping everything onto the floor. "That phone! I never should've discarded it!"

As Reginald plotted his extortion, Evelyn Laurent sat in a café across town. Her eyes turned glacial while scrolling through her phone.

"Xander's vanished too..." Her fingers tapped the table before curling into a smirk.

With swift strokes, she pulled up dossiers on every Quincy enterprise. Whoever dared touch what was hers would pay dearly.

The clink of her coffee cup marked her departure. By the time she stood, her gaze had hardened into lethal resolve.
###Chapter 491

Beatrice Quincy finally relaxed as she stepped through the mansion's gates. She glanced around, noting the numerous bodyguards her father Reginald Quincy had stationed.

This time, Evelyn Laurent wouldn't stand a chance against her!

A smug smile curled Beatrice's lips as she hummed a tune walking toward the parlor.

From Evelyn's cryptic remarks, she'd deduced her father had kidnapped Ethan Sullivan. Her brother Xander Quincy had also mysteriously vanished. Clearly, Reginald had used Xander as bait to trap Ethan.

But Beatrice felt no remorse.

Xander had disgraced the Quincy name these past three years. The eldest son of the Quincy family, abandoning everything for some woman? Degrading himself with menial work?

Her eyes filled with contempt at the thought of her worthless brother. She shook her head, dismissing the irritation. With this security detail, she could rest easy.

However formidable Evelyn might be, could she possibly defeat the elite martial artists Reginald had hired?

These bodyguards were legendary fighters, each a master in their own right!

Beatrice uncorked a bottle of vintage Bordeaux, sipping elegantly. Unbeknownst to her, Evelyn was already crossing Cloudhaven's borders with murderous intent.

Evelyn entered Cloudhaven unimpeded. As a property owner here, security didn't stop her. She easily obtained the Quincy mansion's exact location.

Making no attempt to conceal herself, she marched straight to the estate's gates. As expected, bodyguards immediately blocked her path.

"Private property. No entry!" The guard's voice was ice, radiating danger.

Evelyn ignored him, gazing past toward the mansion. "Is Beatrice here?"

"No comment!" The guard's tone turned glacial.

Evelyn suddenly smiled. "So she is..."

Before the words faded, her eyes turned deadly cold. As the guard shifted into a defensive stance, her hand struck like lightning against his neck. He collapsed instantly.

"Stop her!"

The remaining bodyguards swarmed forward in alarm. These so-called martial arts masters were no match for Evelyn. She moved with blinding speed, felling seven or eight within moments.

"Reginald's standards have fallen," Evelyn flexed her wrist scornfully. "What kind of trash hires this many men who can't stop one woman?"

The guards could only watch helplessly as she advanced unchallenged.

After neutralizing them all, Evelyn frowned at the reinforced door. Her gaze shifted to the second-floor French windows.

Upstairs, Beatrice lounged on the balcony chaise, headphones on, basking in sunlight and wine—oblivious to approaching danger.

Evelyn scaled the wall like a cat, slipping through the open window effortlessly.

When shadows fell across her, Beatrice irritably opened her eyes. "I said not to distur—"

The words died in her throat.

Her pupils contracted violently. The wineglass shattered on the tiles.
###Chapter 492

Beatrice Quincy's pupils constricted violently.

Her entire body froze as she stared at Evelyn Laurent standing in her living room.

The wineglass slipped from her fingers.

Crimson liquid bloomed across the white carpet like fresh blood.

"H-how did you—"

Beatrice's voice trembled.

She had specifically moved to the most secluded mansion in Cloudhaven. Her father had stationed twelve elite bodyguards around the clock.

Yet this woman had appeared before her without a sound.

"Climbed through the window."

Evelyn shrugged casually and settled onto the leather sofa.

She crossed her slender legs, fingertips drumming the armrest.

"Did you really think hiding here would keep me away, Miss Quincy?"

"Or that hiring more bodyguards would make you safe?"

A chill crawled up Beatrice's spine.

The smiling woman before her was more terrifying than any demon from hell.

"What do you want?"

Beatrice clung to her last shreds of composure.

Evelyn leaned forward, cold glinting in her eyes.

"Where's that old bastard Reginald Quincy?"

"I-I don't know—"

Beatrice shook her head frantically, nails digging into her palms.

Evelyn studied her for a moment before smiling.

"Then call him. Video call."

She pulled out her phone leisurely. "Now."

Reginald Quincy's face appeared on screen, paternal warmth in his expression.

"Beatrice, why are you—"

His smile died instantly.

The screen showed Evelyn embracing Beatrice's shoulders, flashing him a sweet smile.

"Long time no see, Uncle Quincy."

Reginald's face drained of color.

He watched his daughter shivering on screen as Evelyn's fingers ghosted over her throat.

"What... what do you want?"

Reginald's voice shook.

Evelyn's smile widened.

"Simple."

She leaned closer to the camera, red lips parting.

"Ethan Sullivan and Xander Quincy."

"In exchange for your precious daughter's life."
###Chapter 493

Reginald Quincy's fingers dug into his palms as he stared at the surveillance monitor.

He couldn't believe his eyes.

Evelyn Laurent had breached multiple security layers and appeared in Ethan Monroe's mansion—now holding Beatrice Quincy hostage.

Were those six-figure bodyguards just for show?

"Daddy!"

Beatrice's scream pierced his eardrums.

Evelyn yanked her hair, smashing Beatrice's face against the camera lens. The actress's carefully styled curls were disheveled, her makeup smeared.

"Stop!" Reginald roared.

The sight of his daughter's reddened cheek made his heart clench like a vise.

"Don't understand plain English?" Evelyn tilted her head, tracing Beatrice's carotid artery with her fingernail. "Let me rephrase—where's Ethan Sullivan?"

The surveillance feed flickered.

Evelyn delivered another backhanded slap.

As Beatrice shrieked, Reginald heard his own molars crack. This madwoman had torn open his meticulously laid plans.

"You think I won't hurt her?"

Evelyn leaned into the camera. The murderous glint in her almond-shaped eyes turned Reginald's blood to ice.

He remembered the report three hours prior—all twelve bodyguards sent to intercept Evelyn were hospitalized with critical injuries.

"Evelyn..." Reginald's voice shook. "Ethan's perfectly fine—"

Smack!

The third slap left Beatrice whimpering soundlessly.

Evelyn flexed her stinging palm. "Uncle Quincy, your daughter's delicate skin can't take much more." Her smile turned saccharine. "Let's play a game. For every minute you stall, I break one of her fingers."

The screen suddenly switched to a basement feed.

Reginald's pupils contracted—Ethan Sullivan was chained in the corner while Xander Quincy advanced with a syringe.

"I'll release him now!"

Evelyn blew on her nails. "Should've cooperated sooner." Her expression darkened. "Remember—this is your last chance."

As the screen went black, Beatrice's bloodcurdling wail echoed: "Dad! She snapped my pinkie—"
###Chapter 494

"If Ethan Sullivan isn't back by tomorrow, I'll pay another visit."

Evelyn Laurent's icy gaze swept over Beatrice Quincy's pallid face. With a tap of her finger, the video call ended abruptly.

Beatrice collapsed to the floor, her legs too weak to stand.

Those once-smiling almond eyes were now filled with terror.

The click of Evelyn's heels against the floor echoed like a death knell, each step sending tremors through Beatrice's body.

Outside the Lowell estate, the sunlight was perfect.

Evelyn squinted slightly, idly toying with the bracelet on her wrist.

The Quincy family's reaction said it all—Ethan was indeed in Reginald Quincy's clutches, along with that Xander Quincy.

But he wasn't in mortal danger.

Did the old fox think kidnapping and blackmail would work?

Evelyn scoffed and hailed a cab.

"Beverly Hills."

As the scenery blurred past the window, her fingers drummed lightly against her knee.

Beatrice was the perfect bargaining chip.

"Evelyn!"

Victoria Langley hurried forward, her eyes scanning her daughter.

"He's with Reginald Quincy." Evelyn plucked an apple from the fruit bowl. "I gave him twenty-four hours."

A crisp crunch.

Juicy sweetness burst between her teeth.

Victoria shook her head with a wry smile. "You..."

"He dared to touch what's mine." Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "I'll make sure his precious daughter learns what true despair feels like."

The weight in her chest lifted.

Now that she knew Ethan was with Reginald, she felt oddly at ease.

That man... was no pushover.

"Just wait and see." Evelyn grinned like a sly cat. "Ethan will turn the Quincy family inside out."

Victoria arched a brow. "That confident?"

"You have no idea." Evelyn swung her foot lightly. "Of all people, Reginald had to kidnap him—"

Her phone buzzed before she could finish.

A message from the Lowell security team: All Quincy accounts under surveillance.

Evelyn burst into laughter.

"It's begun."

Meanwhile, at the Quincy mansion—

Reginald Quincy shattered a teacup against the floor.

"Useless! All of you!"

On the surveillance feed, Beatrice still trembled uncontrollably.

A vein throbbed at his temple.

He'd intended to use Ethan as leverage against the Lowells—only to find himself outmaneuvered.

But the worst was yet to come.

"Sir!" The butler rushed in, panic-stricken. "Sullivan Group just cut off three of our shipping routes!"

Reginald's vision darkened.

What kind of monster had he provoked?
###Chapter 495

Reginald Quincy clenched his fists.

His hawk-like gaze burned into the surveillance screen where Ethan Sullivan lounged carelessly in his chair as if on vacation rather than imprisoned.

"Chairman, the Laurent Group just withdrew two more projects," his assistant stammered.

A porcelain teacup shattered against the floor, dark liquid bleeding into the carpet.

Reginald stalked to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The glittering skyline of the city stretched before him, yet the Quincy Tower stood isolated—a sinking island in the night.

"Double Beatrice's security detail," he rasped. "Keep that madwoman Evelyn Laurent away from her."

The assistant hesitated. With Quincy Holdings' finances crumbling, diverting resources would be disastrous.

A violent cough wracked Reginald's body. Crimson blossoms stained his silk handkerchief.

"Chairman!"

"Get out."

When silence reclaimed the office, Reginald collapsed into his leather chair. The family portrait mocked him—Beatrice's radiant smile searing his conscience.

Midnight.

The basement door crashed open.

Ethan's lips curved as he opened his eyes. "An unexpected visit, Uncle Reginald. Bringing coffee?"

"Enough games," Reginald snarled, face ashen. "You're free to go."

Ethan stretched leisurely. "Where's Xander?"

"He's my son!" Reginald's roar shook the walls. "You've no right—"

With a shrug, Ethan settled back into his chair. "Then we'll continue our tea party."

Reginald kicked open the adjacent cell. "Get out!" he bellowed at Xander.

The younger Quincy emerged, his deadened eyes flickering to life at the sight of Ethan.

As they ascended the stairs, Ethan paused at the exit. His smile turned knife-sharp. "Let's hope you're still this spirited next time, Uncle."

Reginald watched their retreating backs until they vanished. His fist smashed into concrete, knuckles splitting open.

"Ethan Sullivan..." The name dripped with venomous hatred.

Outside Quincy Tower, Ethan tilted his head at the monolithic structure.

"The game has just begun," he murmured.

Xander stood silently behind him, shadows swirling in his unreadable gaze.
###Chapter 496

Reginald Quincy's knuckles turned white as his fists clenched.

Veins bulged along his tense hands.

His dark gaze burned into the retreating figures with venomous fury.

"Dad..." Bianca Fairchild whispered timidly.

"Get out!" Reginald roared, smashing a teacup onto the floor.

Shards scattered in all directions.

Bianca flinched, her eyes instantly welling with tears.

Down the hallway, Xander Quincy's footsteps quickened.

"Ethan, I..." His voice trembled, his Adam's apple bobbing. "I swear I didn't know he would—"

Ethan Sullivan halted abruptly.

Moonlight streamed through the corridor windows, casting sharp shadows across his chiseled profile.

"Do you know what I despise most?" His quiet tone froze Xander in place.

Xander's lips parted soundlessly.

"Betrayal." Ethan turned, his gaze like a blade. "Especially from those I trusted."

Xander's face drained of color.

"I didn't!" He stepped forward urgently. "If I'd known he'd drug you, I'd never have brought you here!"

Ethan studied him with unfathomable depth.

"Xander." A humorless smile touched his lips. "Your father played you too."

The words struck like a sledgehammer.

Xander staggered back against the cold wall.

Yes. Even his own son was just a pawn.

His chest constricted as if crushed by boulders.

"So?" Ethan advanced. "Will you keep being his obedient heir?"

Xander's nails bit into his palms.

Memories surged—

At ten, burning with fever while Reginald planned Beatrice's birthday gala.

At fifteen, his perfect exam score met with "Still inferior to your sister."

At twenty, his dream of studying medicine ended with a backhanded blow...

"I—" His voice cracked.

Ethan waited in silence.

Their elongated shadows stretched across the moonlit floor.

Xander lifted his bloodshot eyes. "I want the Quincy empire."

Soft-spoken, yet each word carried crushing weight.

Ethan's lips curved faintly.

"Certain?"

"The day he exiled Bianca," Xander enunciated, "I should have decided then."

At the corridor's end, a figure melted into darkness.

Reginald stood in the shadows, his expression thunderous.
###Chapter 497

The night wind carried a chill, tugging at Xander Quincy's coat hem.

He stood in the desolate East suburbs, fingers absently tracing the creases on his sleeves.

Ethan Sullivan leaned against rusted iron railings, moonlight gilding his silhouette in silver.

"Made up your mind?" Ethan lit a cigarette, the ember pulsing in the darkness.

Xander stared at that glowing tip, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"The Quincy family..." His voice scattered in the wind. "Should've ended long ago."

A stray cat's whimper echoed in the distance like an omen.

Ethan exhaled a smoke ring. "You know your father's methods better than I do."

Xander suddenly laughed, the sound laced with self-mockery.

He remembered the cold instruments in the basement. Reginald Quincy's twisted face.

"Twenty years I've run." He raised a hand to shield his eyes. "This time—"

Headlights from a passing truck sliced through his words, illuminating his pallid face.

Ethan stubbed out the cigarette. "About Rachel—"

"I know." Xander cut him off, fingers trembling slightly. "The girl in red at the airport."

He'd never forget those eyes.

So like the girl who vanished in the rain a decade ago.

"I owe her." Xander turned, his trench coat flaring decisively. "A debt I can never repay."

Ethan watched his friend dissolve into the night before dialing a number.

"Harrison. Bring the car to the usual spot."

An exaggerated groan came through. "Boss! It's 3 AM!"

"Quintuple bonus."

"On my way!"

Twenty minutes later, Harrison appeared with bedhead and two coffee cups.

"Your iced Americano, sir." He obsequiously offered car keys. "Fresh clothes in the back."

Ethan checked his watch. "Take tomorrow off."

Harrison's eyes lit up, but the black Maybach had already roared away.

In the rearview mirror, skeletal trees clawed at the moonlit sky.

Ethan floored the accelerator, the speedometer needle spinning right.

His phone screen illuminated with a text from Lillian:
「Beverly Hills」

The corner of his mouth lifted, but his eyes remained glacial.
###Chapter 498

The night was ink-black, neon lights of the city streaking past the car window.

The black Maybach rolled into Beverly Hills, tires crunching faintly over fallen leaves.

Ethan Sullivan lowered the window, his gaze fixed on the familiar French windows on the second floor of the Laurent mansion.

The curtains were drawn tight, not a sliver of light escaping.

His long fingers absently tapped the car door armrest.

Three years.

Every late night after work, he'd instinctively look toward that window.

Evelyn Laurent used to curl up in the armchair by the window with her files, warm lamplight tracing her focused profile.

Now it was 2 AM.

Logic told him to come back tomorrow.

But the longing in his chest threatened to break free.

His suit jacket was tossed carelessly onto the backseat.

Ethan undid his cufflinks and vaulted over the garden fence.

His movements were fluid, as if he'd practiced this climb a thousand times.

The window lock clicked softly.

Moonlight filtered through the sheer curtains, outlining the curves beneath the sheets.

Evelyn lay on her side, silk strap slipping off her shoulder, clutching the starry body pillow he'd given her.

Ethan held his breath.

The mattress dipped suddenly.

Evelyn's eyes flew open.

She swung the pillow with force, but he caught her wrist mid-air.

"It's me."

His deep voice cut through the darkness.

Her pupils dilated violently.

Fingertips recognized the familiar grooves of his watch, and her tense body instantly relaxed.

"You—"

Her unfinished words were swallowed by a scorching embrace.

Ethan pulled her close, burying his face in her hair with a shuddering inhale.

The scent of orange blossom soap mingled with something metallic.

Evelyn began trembling violently.

"The Quincy basement." He tightened his arms around her shaking form. "I'm fine."

Her icy fingers traced the abrasion on his nape.

Moonlight revealed the angry gash, and her tears splashed against his collarbone.

"They used tranquilizer darts."

Ethan laced their fingers together, pressing their joined hands against his chest.

"I woke up in a shipping container."

Evelyn jerked back.

Her red-rimmed eyes gleamed like poisoned blades.

"Reginald Quincy?"

"Not just him." His thumb brushed the faded ring mark on her finger. "Your uncle too."

Her body turned to stone in his arms.

Ethan kissed her quivering eyelids.

"Don't be afraid."

Thunder cracked outside.

As the downpour began, Evelyn bit through his lower lip.
###Chapter 499

Evelyn's fingertips trembled slightly.

The stormy night on that island three years ago flashed vividly in her mind.

It was the final day of filming.

The rain had just stopped when armed intruders silently infiltrated the island.

She remembered their grotesque faces.

The whistle of bullets grazing her ear.

Most of all, she remembered Ethan's chiseled profile as he shielded her with his body.

"Evelyn?"

Ethan noticed her distress, his warm palm covering her ice-cold hand.

She snapped back to reality.

Suddenly, she threw herself into his arms, clutching his shirt with white-knuckled desperation.

"Do you have any idea how terrified I was—"

Her voice broke into a sob.

Ethan's heart clenched.

He tightened his embrace, enveloping her completely.

"I'm sorry." His lips brushed her hair. "I promise this won't happen again."

Evelyn inhaled his scent greedily.

Pinewood mixed with faint traces of blood.

The familiar aroma made her eyes burn.

For three years, they'd existed like parallel lines.

Always close, yet maintaining careful distance.

But today—

When she received news of his disappearance—

She realized some words left unspoken might never be said.

"Ethan..."

She tilted her face upward.

Moonlight through the curtains scattered silver fragments in her eyes.

Before he could react—

Soft lips grazed his.

Light as a butterfly's wing.

Delicate enough to make his heart tremble.

Crash.

The dam of restraint shattered.

Ethan cradled the back of her neck, deepening the kiss.

Between ragged breaths—

He tasted the salt of her tears.

Evelyn's legs gave out.

She clung to him like a drowning woman to driftwood.

Only when their lungs burned for air—

Did they finally break apart, gasping.

"You—" Ethan's thumb brushed her swollen lips. "Learned how to breathe properly?"

She punched his chest in embarrassment.

He caught her wrist and pinned it against the bed.

"It was Reginald."

Ethan's expression darkened.

He recounted the kidnapping methodically.

With every word—

The murderous glint in Evelyn's eyes intensified.

"That old bastard!" She jerked upright. "And that bitch Beatrice—"

Her fist slammed into the mattress.

Ethan interlaced their fingers.

"Patience." He kissed her knuckles. "We'll settle this account... slowly."
###Chapter 500

Evelyn clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"That bitch Beatrice deserves more slaps!" she hissed through gritted teeth. "And that old bastard Reginald is worse than an animal!"

Her chest heaved violently, her breathing turning ragged.

Reginald Quincy's actions had exceeded her worst nightmares.

What kind of monster would harm his own flesh and blood?

First using Xander to kidnap Ethan, then subjecting Xander to two decades of psychological torment.

Just hearing Ethan describe that suffocating control made her blood run cold.

Noticing her trembling, Ethan gently took her hand.

"Don't think about it," his deep voice soothed.

He subtly shifted closer, wrapping one strong arm around her shoulders.

Evelyn melted into his warm embrace.

"Next time..." she mumbled against his chest, "this can't happen again."

The medication began taking effect, drowsiness washing over her like a tide.

Her words slurred as she drifted into deep sleep.

Ethan gazed down at her with aching tenderness.

Adjusting their positions for comfort, he gradually closed his eyes.

The night passed in rare tranquility.

Evelyn clung to Ethan like an octopus, sleeping soundly.

He endured her koala grip with quiet amusement, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"Evelyn! Open up!"

Urgent knocking shattered the morning calm.

Julian's voice pierced through the door: "There's news about Ethan!"

Evelyn jolted awake.

Her vision filled with Ethan's striking features up close.

Morning light cast shadows from his thick lashes across his face, highlighting his aristocratic nose and sculpted lips.

She stared, momentarily transfixed.

Only when she registered her limbs tangled around him did reality crash back.

"Hide!" she scrambled to push Ethan away.

Before he could react, she'd shoved him into the walk-in closet.

"Evelyn?" Julian knocked again.

Taking a steadying breath, she smoothed her tousled hair before opening the door.

"Brother..." she feigned composure.

Julian looked frantic. "That fox Reginald finally released them! Ethan and Xander were freed early yesterday morning."

He paused, studying her. "You look terrible. Didn't sleep well?"

Inside the closet, Ethan held his breath.
