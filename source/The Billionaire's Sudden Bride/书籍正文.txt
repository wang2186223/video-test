###Chapter 1: I'm the One Walking Away

**Summer's POV*

The crisp autumn breeze at JFK carried the familiar scent of home as I wheeled my luggage through the arrival gates. After a year of managing Fortune Corp's European division, I couldn't wait to surprise Alexander.Our third anniversary was coming up, and I'd deliberately finished my assignment two weeks early to celebrate it with him.

*God. I've missed him so much.* My heart fluttered as I checked my phone,half expecting to see a message from him. The screen showed nothing but the usual notifications and a missed call from Victoria. *Whatever drama my sister's cooking up can wait.*

The taxi ride to Fortune Corp felt endless. I'd rehearsed this moment countless times during those lonely nights in London - walking into his office,seeing his face light up with that boyish smile I'd fallen in love with.Three years together, and he still made my heart race like a teenager's.

"Miss Taylor?" The receptionist's bright voice snapped me out of my daydream. "Welcome back! Are you here for the General Manager's wedding?"

I froze."The...what?"

"Oh!" Her smile faltered. "The engagement party, I mnean. At The Plaza Hotel? For Mr. Alexander Stark and Miss Victoria Taylor?" The words hit me like a physical blow. *Alexander and... Victoria?* My sister? "There must be some mistake," I heard myself say, my voice unnaturally calm. "Alexander Stark is my fiancé." The receptionist's face drained of color. "I... um...perhaps you should speak with Mr. Stark directly? He's at The Plaza Hotel for the engagement ceremony..."

I don't remember leaving the building. My feet carried me automatically while my mind spun in circles, trying to make sense of what I'd just heard.*This is crazy. There has to be an explanation. Victoria would never...Alexander couldn't possibly...*




The Plaza Hotel loomed before me, its elegant facade seeming to mock my disheveled state. And there it was - a massive photo display in the lobby.Alexander and Victoria, looking picture-perfect together. His arm around her waist. Her diamond ring catching the light.
*This isn't happening. This can't be happening.*

My legs shook as I made my way to the Grand Ballroom. The sound of laughter and clinking glasses grew louder with each step. Then I saw them.
Alexander had his arm around Victoria's waist, just like in the photo.She was wearing a stunning white dress, her smile radiant as she leaned into him. They looked... perfect together. Like they belonged.

"Summer!" Alexander's voice cut through the buzzing in my ears."You actually came to our engagement party?"

"Your.,,engagement party?" The words tasted like ash in my mouth.′′Aryou kidding me right now? Alexander, what the hell is going on? Victoria.how could you do this?"
###Chapter 1: I'm the One Walking Away

away, and I'm the one making a scene? That's rich!"

The sharp crack of the slap echoed through the ballroom.Mymother.Elizabeth, stood before me, her hand still raised. "You disgraceful child!How dare you try to ruin your sister's special day?"

"Mom, have you literally lost your mind?" My cheek burned where she'd struck me. "Alexander is MY fiancé! What is wrong with you people?"

"What absolute nonsense are you spouting?" Elizabeth's voice dripped with disdain. "Alexander will be your brother-in-law soon. Why must you always try to compete with Victoria? It's pathetic,really."

The room spun around me. Faces blurred together-shocked guests,smirking Victoria, stern Elizabeth. And Alexander, looking at me with something between pity and annoyance.

"Alexander." My voice shook. "Tell them the truth. Tell them who you were really engaged to this whole time."

He met my eyes, and I saw nothing of the man I'd loved for three years."Summer, I'm sorry, but Victoria is the one I truly love. She always has been. You need to accept that and move on."

Something broke inside me then. The last thread of hope, maybe.Or perhaps it was just my heart.

"Alexander Stark." I straightened my spine, forcing steel into my voice."Remember this - I'm not the one being left. I'm the one walking away.And you'll regret this day for the rest of your life."



The New York evening air hit my face as I stumbled out of The Plaza.Tears blurred my vision as I rushed down the sidewalk, needing to get as far away as possible from that nightmare scene. The weight of everything I'd lost pressed against my chest: three years with Alexander, countless shared dreams, the simple trust I'd placed in my own sister. How long had they been seeing each other behind my back?How many of our phone calls had been lies? How many times had Victoria smiled at me while knowing what she planned to do?
A sudden screech of tires jerked me from my spiral of thoughts.*Great,just what I need - to be run over on the worst day of my life.* Bright headlights flooded my vision as a black Bentley came to an abrupt stop mere inches from where I stood frozen in the crosswalk. The shock sent me stumbling backward, my ankle twisting as I lost my balance and fell hard against the asphalt. *Perfect. Absolutely perfect.*
The car's rear door opened, and two men stepped out. The first was in an impeccable suit, clearly some kind of assistant. But it was the second man who made me forget to breathe for a moment.
He was tall, at least 6'2", with sharp features that seemed carved from marble and brown hair. His presence radiated authority, the kind of power that came not just from wealth, but from absolute confidence. Those eyes,though-they held me captive. Deep brown with flecks of amber that caught the streetlight, they studied me with an intensity that felt almost physical. His jaw was sharp and defined, with a hint of stubble that gave him a dangerous edge. Full lips set in a stern line completed a face that would make sculptors weep-perfect in its symmetry yet utterly masculine in its severity.

"Mr. Stark?" The assistant's voice carried a note of concern. *Another Stark,* I thought bitterly, recognizing the way oldmoney seemed to cling to him like a second skin. But there was something different about this one -something almost predatory in his focused gaze.
"James," The taller man's deep, commanding voice sent an inexplicable shiverdown my spine. "Stay back." Without waiting for his assistant's response, he stepped forward,his movements deliberate and precise. I found myself unable to look away from those dark eyes as he extended his hand toward me. For a moment.I just stared at it, my mind struggling to process this simple gesture after everything that had happened.

"Are you alright? Take my hand."
###Chapter 2: Get Your Fucking Hands off Her
Summer's POV

The Manhattan Club's crystal chandeliers sparkled overhead, but they felt like a blur through my fifth glass of whiskey. I’d never been a heavy drinker, but after the nightmare at The Plaza, I needed something to dull the bitter taste of betrayal.

"Now that's a crime," a male voice drawled from my left. "A beautiful lady drinking alone?"

I didn't bother turning. "Not interested."

"Playing hard to get?" A second voice joined in. "Come on, sweetheart. Let us show you a good time."

Suddenly, the room seemed to tilt. My head was spinning far more than it should have been. Something's wrong. This wasn't just the alcohol. A creeping dread seeped through the haze—I couldn't think straight, and my limbs felt unnaturally heavy.

"Back off," I managed to slur, but my tongue felt like lead.

The men didn't listen. They stepped closer, their intentions clear in their predatory smiles. "Looks like someone can't handle her liquor," one said with false concern. "We should help her out."

Strong hands gripped my arms, pulling me up. I tried to fight, to scream, but my muscles refused to respond. They half-dragged me toward a private VIP room at the back of the club. Terror clawed at my chest as the door swung shut behind us.

"Please," I whispered, feeling completely vulnerable. "Let me go."

One of the men began to loosen his tie, moving toward me with a sickening grin. Just as I thought I was lost, the door burst open with enough force to splinter the frame.

A tall figure stood in the doorway, his presence alone making the temperature in the room drop. It was the man from the crosswalk—Brandon Stark.

"Get your hands off her," he said, his voice deceptively soft but carrying a terrifying edge of authority.

The men froze. "Mr. Stark? We... we didn't know she was with you."

"Did you touch her?" Brandon stepped forward, his eyes like ice. The two men fumbled, backing away in sheer terror.

As I struggled to stand, my legs gave out. I didn't hit the floor; instead, I collided with something solid and warm. Brandon’s strong arms steadied me, lifting me effortlessly into his embrace. I buried my face in his shoulder, the world finally fading into black as he carried me away from the nightmare.
###Chapter 3: The Recovery

Summer's POV

My whole body felt like it was on fire. Through the haze of the drug, I was vaguely aware of being carried into a suite. I whimpered, the heat under my skin becoming unbearable.

"Please... make it stop," I begged, my hands fumbling at Brandon’s jacket as if looking for an anchor.

He didn't speak, but I could feel the tension in his frame. He carried me into a bathroom, and moments later, a shock of cold water slammed into my skin. I gasped, my body jerking from the temperature change.

"Stay still!" his deep voice commanded. His hands were unyielding, pinning me down in the tub to ensure the cold water could counteract the feverish heat of the drug.

"James, I need ice. Now," he barked into an earpiece.

Minutes felt like hours as I thrashed against the cold, my mind a blur of fire and frost. Brandon stayed with me, his grip firm yet somehow protective, keeping me grounded as the drug’s effects slowly began to recede.

Eventually, the burning began to fade, replaced by a bone-deep exhaustion. The last thing I heard was his low, reassuring voice: "Sleep now. You're safe."

I woke up the next morning in a luxurious bed, the sunlight streaming through the windows. I was covered in soft, expensive sheets. When Brandon entered the room, he looked at me with an intensity that made my skin prickle.

"Nothing happened last night," he said calmly, noticing my panic. "Your clothes were ruined from the ice bath—a necessity to save you. The maid changed you after you fell asleep."

Relief washed over me, but it was quickly replaced by a new kind of tension as he sat at the edge of the bed. "You have a beautiful spirit, Miss Taylor," he remarked, his eyes searching mine. "But you're in a dangerous position. Everyone is talking about the 'jilted fiancée' of Alexander Stark."
###Chapter 4: From Now On, You Have Me

Summer's POV

Mr. Stark's fingers traced the edge of his platinum cufflink as he spoke, the gesture casual yet radiating a quiet, absolute authority. "Who I am is less important than what I can do for you. And right now, I am the only one offering you a way out."

That commanding tone... he was clearly a man accustomed to being heard. I clutched the silk covers tighter, my pulse hammering against my ribs. The sheer vulnerability of my situation was starting to weigh on me, every instinct screaming at me to keep my guard up. "I don't need your help," I said, my voice sharper than I intended, brittle with the memories of the last time I’d misplaced my trust.

He moved closer, his steps measured and deliberate. My heart stuttered as the soft sound of his shoes against the plush carpet filled the silence.

"Is that so?" His deep voice held a hint of amusement, but his eyes remained intense—dark and searching, as if they could see right through the walls I’d built overnight. A slight smile played at the corner of his mouth. "Why go to the Manhattan Club alone last night? Between a fiancé who betrayed you and a family that refuses to stand by you, you’ve become the center of a storm you aren't prepared for."

"Who are you?" I demanded again. This wasn't a coincidence; he knew far too much.

He took another step, and I caught the scent of winter air and expensive cedarwood. "Brandon Stark."

The Brandon Stark? The name hit me like a physical blow. My mind raced through the headlines—the power, the influence, the legendary Stark reserve. "Wait... what is your connection to Alexander?"

His lips curved into a subtle, knowing smile. "If I told you our interests rarely align, would you believe me?"

I narrowed my eyes, pulling the sheet higher to ensure my dignity remained intact. "Are you trying to use me as leverage? Is this some family feud I’ve been dragged into?"

A short, dismissive laugh escaped him. "Leverage? You’re giving Alexander far too much credit if you think he’s the primary concern here."

He closed the distance between us in two fluid strides, his imposing height casting a long shadow in the morning light. The room suddenly felt smaller, the air charged with a tension I couldn't quite name. I clutched the silk tighter, painfully aware of the contrast between his perfectly tailored suit and my precarious state. I tried to shift back, but there was nowhere left to go.

His tie pin caught the sunlight as he leaned in slightly, his voice dropping to a low, resonant rumble that made my skin prickle. "Miss Taylor," he said, his eyes searching mine with a sudden, startling sincerity. "Don't you feel the weight of it? Being betrayed by the very people who should have protected you... don't you want to change the narrative?"

Yes. No. I don't know. The chaos of the last twenty-four hours threatened to spill over. I saw a flash of something in his expression—not triumph, but a strange kind of recognition.

"That’s none of your business," I whispered, but the defiance felt weak even to my own ears.

He placed his hands on the edge of the bed, not touching me, but creating a space that felt entirely focused on my response. The morning light caught the sharp angle of his jaw as he spoke the words that stopped my world:

"Marry me."

The silence that followed was deafening. I stared at him, certain I’d misheard. "What?"

"I can offer you a life of security and respect that no one else in your circle can provide." His tone was matter-of-fact, as if he were discussing a high-stakes merger rather than a lifelong commitment.

"Are you serious?" Heat rushed to my face. "You’re making a proposal to a stranger in a room like this? It’s completely inappropriate!"

I tried to push past the shock, clutching the sheet to my chest with a white-knuckled grip. "This is ridiculous!"

"Is it?" He didn't move, his presence as steady as a mountain. He caught my gaze, his hand coming up to tilt my chin just slightly, forcing me to meet that dark, unwavering stare.

"Just because you stepped in last night doesn't mean I owe you my life," I managed to say, my voice trembling despite my best efforts. "We aren't living in a fairy tale."

His eyes seemed to darken with a hidden depth. "The more you resist the idea, the more certain I am that you’re exactly the person I’m looking for."

"You don't even know me," I breathed, unable to look away.

"I know enough." His thumb brushed near my jawline, the briefest touch that felt like an electric current. "I know you’ve been underestimated. I know you’re looking for a way to fight back without losing yourself."

"Stop," I whispered, my hand pressing against his chest to maintain the distance between us. I could feel the steady, powerful beat of his heart through the fine fabric of his suit. "Just... stop."

His expression softened, the intensity giving way to a gesture that was startlingly gentle as he brushed a stray lock of hair from my forehead. "Don't sell yourself short, Summer." His grip on the moment remained firm, his voice dropping to a whisper that seemed to brand itself into my mind. "You aren't alone in this. Not anymore."

He leaned in until I could feel the warmth radiating from him, his final words sounding like a vow. "From now on, you have me."

###Chapter 5: Mr. Stark, You Might Wanna Check Your Brain
**Summer's POV**

"Are you out of your mind?" I clutched the silksheets tighter around my body,painfully aware that I was completely naked beneath. I pressed my back against the headboard, my heart racing as I watched him move with that predatory grace that seemed to come so naturally. Every gesture,every look reminded me that this man was dangerous - not in the crude way of those guys at the bar last night, but in a way that made my pulse skip. "Marriage? We don't even know each other!"

His dark eyes tracked my movement, and the corner of his mouth lifted in that infuriating half-smile that somehow managed to be both arrogant and attractive. Those eyes - they seemed to see right through every defense I tried to put up, including the sheet I was desperately clinging to. "Don't we?" The subtle sound of his footsteps made my pulse race. "You crashed into my arms last night, Summer. And I didn't find your touch...unpleasant."

I jerked away as his fingers reached for my chin, pulling the sheet higher."Mr.Stark-"
 
"Brandon." "Whatever." I wrapped the sheet tighter around myself, trying to create some kind of barrier between us. "Don't you understand? I won't marry you. I don't know you, and I definitely don't love you." Something dangerous flickered in his eyes. "Then who do you love?Alexander?" His voice carried a razor's edge. "Well, he's going to be yourbrother-in-law soon."
The casual cruelty of his words hit me like a slap. "What's that got to do with you?" My voice cracked embarrassingly. "Why are you so obsessed with marrying me? Can't you find someone else?"

"You're the first woman I don't find repulsive."

I stared at him, momentarily speechless. *Was that supposed to be a compliment?* "Wow. Really? That's your pitch? Mr. Stark, you might want to work on your proposal skills."

He moved to the leather sofa, settling into it with the casual grace of a predator at rest. Even just sitting there, he exuded an aura of absolute control that made me painfully aware of how out of my depth I was-especially in my current undressed state. "It's simple. Let's make a deal."

*A deal? With Brandon Stark?* My mind flashed back to all the whispered stories I'd heard about his business dealings - about how no one ever came out ahead when making deals with him. "A deal?" I pulled my knees to my chest, keeping the sheet securely wrapped around me. "This isn't a merger or acquisition, Mr. Stark. This is marriage we're talking about."

"I need a wife." He stated it like he was discussing the weather. "And you're perfect for the position."

I laughed, "Mr. Stark, you might need to check up your brain." "Miss Taylor." His voice softened slightly, but his eyes remained intense."Take your time. I'm a patent man." Before I could form a response, there was a discrete knock at the door. I flinched, instinctively pulling the sheet higher as James entered with the same efficient grace I'd noticed last night, carrying what looked like designer shopping bags.

Brandon barely moved, just lifted his chin slightly. "Your clothes, Miss Taylor."

I hesitated. eyeing the bags suspiciously. The events of last night were still fuzzy,but I was acutely aware of mycurrent state of undress.*Did he have his assistant buy me an entire wardrobe?*

James set the bags down with a slight bow. "The bathroom is through that door,Miss Taylor."

I glanced anxiously between the bags and the bathroom door,painfully aware of my predicament. To reach the bathroom, I'd have to cross the room with nothing but a sheet to cover myself.

"Could you both please..." I started, my voice trailing off as Brandon made absolutely no move to leave. His dark eyes held mine with that unsettling intensity,clearly having no intention of giving me privacy.

"James, you may go," Brandon said, his gaze never leaving mine.

"You too," I said firmly, clutching the sheet tighter around me.

Brandon's lips curved into that infuriating half-smile. "This is my suite,Miss Taylor."

My face burned. "Then at least turn around!" One perfect eyebrow arched slightly, but after a moment, he turned to face the window. I slid out of bed carefully, wrapping the sheet around me toga-style, knowing it was far from secure. Every step toward the bathroom felt like walking a tightrope, the silk sheet threatening to slip with each movement.

Just as I reached for the bags, the sheet caught under my foot. I fumbled desperately, but it was too late-the fabric slipped,exposing my bare back and side before I could catch it.

I heard Brandon shift behind me, and froze. Had he turned around? Had he seen me? My heart hammered against my ribs as I clutched the sheet back into place. grabbed the bags, andrushed into the bathroom without looking back.

I chose a Chanel outfit from the bad. What made my skin crawl wasn't the obvious expense - it was how everything fit perfectly. *How did he know my exact size?*

Alone in the massive marble bathroom, I finally let my mnask slip. The face that stared back at me from the mirror looked foreign - pale, with shadows under the eyes that even designer concealer couldn't quitehide.*One year.* I'd been gone for just one year, managing Fortune Corp's European division. One year of late-night calls with Alexander,of missing him so much... I gripped the marble counter until my knuckles turned white. *Come on, Summer, don't cry over them again.*

When I emerged, I knew my eyes were red-rimmed despite my best efforts.Brandon was standing by the window, his tall frame silhouetted against the Manhattan skyline. He tuarned as I approached, something unreadable flickering across his face. He held out a business card, the cream cardstock thick and expensive between my fingers. My breath caught as I read the embossed text: *Brandon Stark, CEO,Stark Group.* "Don't reject help when it'soffered." His voice was quiet but carried that same undercurrent of steel I'd noticed before.

"Help?" I couldn't helpbut laugh. "What about you just say what you want from me?"

His fingers brushed my forehead, tucking away a stray strand of hair. The touch sent an involuntary shiver down my spine - gentle, almost tender,but somehow still feeling like a claim being staked. I found myself holding my breath, caught between the instinct to pull away and a traitorous urge to lean into his touch. "Ill be waiting for your good news."

I stood frozen, watching his retreating back. The door closed with a soft click, leaving me alone with my thoughts and a business card that felt like it was burning a hole in my palm.

*Brandon Stark.* One of Wall Street's Four Kings. The financial prodigy who'd taken control of the Stark Group at an age when most people were still figuring out their careers.

And he wanted to marry me? *Why?* What could someone like him possibly want with someone whose reputation was in tatters, whose own family had turned against her?

I slipped the card into my bag before I left, trying to ignore how my fingers trembled slightly. Whatever game Brandon Stark was playing, I wanted no part of it. *So why can't I just throw his card away?*
###Chapter 6:How Shameless


**Summer's POV**

The morning sun felt like a mockery as I stepped out of the taxi in front of my apartment building. *God, what a night.* My head still throbbed from whatever those creeps had slipped into my drink, and Brandon Stark's bizarre marriage proposal kept replaying in my mind like a fever dream.

I stared up at the gleaming glass tower that had been my home for the past year. Alexander had helped me choose this place when I'd finally had enough of my parents' manipulation. *"This will be our fresh start,"* he'd promised. *"Just you and me."* Now those words tasted like ash in my mouth.

The doorman gave me a sympathetic nod as I walked past. *Great. Even the staff knows about the scandal.* I jabbed the elevator button harder than necessary, willing the doors to close before anyone else could-

"Hold the elevator!"

*You've got to be kidding me.* Victoria's perfectly manicured hand shot between the closing doors, forcing them back open. She stepped in with her usual grace, Alexander trailing behind her like a well-trained puppy.The space suddenly felt suffocating.

"Summer,you're finally back?" Victoria's voice dripped with false concern."We've been so worried." I watched her reflection in the elevator's polished doors - perfect makeup,designer outfit, not a hair out of place. *Even for this early morning ambush,she had to look perfect.* My own reflection looked pae and drawn in comparison. I kept my eyes fixed on the elevator numbers, climbing far too slowly.*Deep breaths. Don't let them see you crack. Don't give them the satisfaction.*

"You went missing after the party," Alexander added,his tone carrying that familiar note of disapproval that I'd somehow never noticed before."Do you know how worried we've been?"

A bitter laugh escaped before I couId stop it. "Worried? Since when do you care about my whereabouts, Alexander?"

The elevator dinged, and I practically bolted out. But Alexander's hand caught my arm, spinning me around to face them.

"Look, we get that you're upset," Victoria said, all honey-sweet poison.She reached for my hand, and I had to fight the urge to recoil. "But what Alexander and I have... it's the real deal. While you were gone this past year, he was going through so much, and I was just there for him..."

"Wow.Supporting him. How thoughtful of you." The words burned my throat. "You knew he was my fiancé, but you just had to be there for him,right? What's your actual game here?"

I shoved past her, probably harder than necessary. She stumbled back with an exaggerated gasp.

"Jesus, Summer!" Alexander's face twisted with anger. "You're being ridiculous! Yeah, we hurt you, but it's done. We're engaged now. Just deal with it." "Deal with it?" My voice cracked with disbelief. "Oh, I'm dealing withit.By telling you both to stay the hell away from me!" Victoria's eyes filled with perfectly-timed tears. "Summer,please...we never meant to hurt you. We just... fell in love."

I couldn't hold back the harsh laugh. "That's rich. Victoría,if you're so desperate to take other people's leftovers, be my guest. I don't want anything that's been touched by someone like you."

Alexander's hand shot up, and for a moment, I thought he might actually hit me. His face twisted into something ugly -so different from the gentle expressions I'd fallen in love with.

"Alexander, don't!" Victoria grabbed his arm, playing the perfect peacemaker. "She's still my sister."

"Sister?" The word felt like poison. "Don't make me sick. You two deserve each other. Now tell me why you're really here or get out of my way!"

"It's Grandpa," Victoria finally admitted, dropping her voice. "He says he won't support our marriage unless you come home."

*There it was.* The real reason for this little ambush. "So that's what this is about? You need Grandpa's blessing for your perfect wedding?"

"Come on, Summer," Alexander said with that condescending tone he used with junior employees. "Just think about Victoria for once. Don't you want her to be happy?"

"When did either of you think about mine?" I could hear my voice rising despite my best efforts to stay calm.
"Look, this just happened," Victoria said, spreading her hands helplessly."You can't blame us for following our hearts." "Following your hearts?" I nearly choked on the words. "Was that what you were doing when you asked about my relationship every time wetalked? Playing the concerned sister while planning to take him?"

"That's not fair-" Alexander started, but I cut him off.

"Fair? You want to talk about fair?" The word exploded from me. "What about all those promises, Alexander? 'T'llnever betray you,Summer.You're the only one for me.' Was that fair?"

Victoria's perfect mask slipped for just a moment, revealing something ugly underneath. "God, you're being so dramatic right now-"

"You don't know me," I said, my voice suddenly quiet. "You never did.Neither of you did."

Victoria reached for my arm. "Summer, please. Remember when we were little? Those men who tried to take you... I saved your life!"

The mention of that childhood incident hit me like a physical blow.*How dare she use that against me now?*

"Yeah,Victoria. You saved me once. And now you've destroyed my life.Consider us even." I opened my door and faced them one last time. "You got what you wanted. Now get out."

The moment the door clicked shut behind them, my legs gave out. I slid down the wall, the tears I'd been holding back finally breaking free.
###Chapter 7: Good to See You Again, Ms.Tayla
**Summer's POV**

The next morning, my reflection in the bathroom mirror looked like something out of a hangover PSA. Dark circles under puffy eyes, pale skin.and a general air of someone who'd spent the night crying on their floor instead of sleeping in their ridiculously expensive bed. *Perfect. Just perfect.*

Victoria's words from yesterday kept echoing in my head. Each memory felt like a fresh slap.

I splashed cold water on my face, willing the icy shock to wake me up properly. *Come on, Summer. Pull yourself together. You're better than this.* The familiar routine of applying concealer and mascara helped steady my hands, if not my heart. Layer by layer, I rebuilt my armor-foundation to hide the tearstains, concealer for the dark circles, mascara to brighten eyes dulled by another sleepless night.

*God, when did I become this person?* A year ago, I'd been the golden girl of Fortune Corp's European division, engaged to Alexander, secure in my sister's love. Now? Now I was the scandal of Wall Street, hiding in my apartment and crying myself to sleep. *No. No more of that.* My phone buzzed just as I was finishing my makeup, making me jump.My maternal grandfather Jonathan Thompson's familiar contact photo lit up the screen, and just seeing it made something in my chest ache.Grandpa had always been my safe harbor, the one person who never played favorites between Victoria and me. "Hi Grandpa," I managed, trying to inject some cheer into my voice.Fake it till you make it, right? "Missing me already?"
"You silly girl!" His warm voice wrapped around me like a hug. "Come see me tomorrow!"

"Grandpa,I-"

"Don't forget!"

A small, genuine smile tugged at my lips despite everything. "Alright.alright,I'll come,okay?"




The next afternoon found the cab I was in pulling into the familiar driveway of Grandpa's Upper East Side brownstone, a bag of groceries from Whole Foods riding shotgun. I'd spent way too long debating what to bring-the whole point of visiting was supposed to be checking on him.making sure he was eating properly, but somehow I'd turned it into an hour-long anxiety spiral. *Should I get organic kale or regular? Does he still like those fancy protein shakes? Will he roll his eyes at the gluten-free bread?* After the driver pulled over, the bag of groceries shifted slightly in the back seat, a box of his favorite Earl Grey tea threatening to spill out. I'd grabbed it on impulse, remembering all the times he'd made us tea while helping me with my calculus homework. Such a small thing, but thinking about it now made my eyes burn. Parker, Grandpa's long-time butler, opened the door before I could even ring the bell. His familiar dignified face brightened with a warm smile."Welcome back, Miss Summer. Please, come in." I started toward the kitchen with my grocery bag, but Parker cleared his throat softly. "Professor Thompson has a guest today."

"A guest?" I frowned. "But Grandpa said today..."

A deep,familiar voice drifted from the study, stopping me in my tracks."The market indicators were clear, Professor. The real question was whether the board would recognize them in time."

*That voice.* My heart stuttered in my chest. *It couldn't be.*

"Brandon, my boy." Grandpa's warm chuckle carried down the hall. "You haven't visited your old professor in ages. Too busy with Wall Street?"

*Brandon. Brandon Stark. Here.* The grocery bag suddenly felt too heavy in my arms. What were the odds? What were the *fucking* odds that he'd be here today of all days?

"Summer's here?" Grandpa's voice carried from the study, and I realized I must have made some sound of distress. "Come in, dear!"

My feet carried me forward on autopilot. The study door seemed to loom before me, heavy oak panels hiding whatever scene waited on the other side. *Get it together. You're not doing anything wrong. This is your grandfather's house.*


I pushed open the door, plastering on my best attempt at a casual smile. "Hi,Grandpa! I brought some groceries-" "I told you to just come over." Grandpa's mock-stern voice was belied by the warmth in his eyes. I set the bag down and moved to hug him, breathing in the familiar scent of his cologne and old books. For a moment, I could pretend everything was normal. That I was just visiting my grandfather like always,not hiding from scandal and society gossip.

"Come here," he said softly. "Let me have a good look at you."

I pulled back, summoning my best playful pout. "Grandpa, I've missed you so much! Did you miss me?"

"Miss you? Nonsense." But his hand came up to pat my head gently,just like when I was little. Then his tone shifted slightly. "Still acting like a child. Can't you see I have a guest?"

*Right. Him.* I turned slowly, knowing exactly what I'd see. Brandon Stark sat in one of the leather armchairs, looking every inch the Wall Street titan in another perfectly tailored suit. His dark eyes watched me with that same intensity I remembered from the Manhattan Club,like he could see right through every defense I tried to put up.

"Brandon," Grandpa's voice carried a note I couldn't quite read. "Let me introduce you to my granddaughter, Summer Taylor."

I wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it all. *Oh, we've met, Grandpa. He saved me from being assaulted, gave me an ice bath, and then proposed marriage. You know, totally normal stuff.*

"Summer, this is my former student, Brandon Stark."

"What are you doing here?" The words slipped out before I could stop them. One corner of Brandon's mouth lifted in that infuriating half-smile."Ms.Taylor. Good to see you again." "Oh?" Grandpa's eyebrows rose slightly. "You two know each other?" "Haha." I jumped in quickly, probably a bit too brightly. "We've met briefly.Mr. Stark helped me out of some trouble, right. Mr. Stark?"
###Chapter 8: Mr. Stark, Could You Please Kee Your Distance?
**Summer's POV**

Brandon's eyes never left my face as hereplied, "Indeed, Professor.Though seeing Ms. Taylor's spirited appearance today, it seems she's already moved past that difficult time?"

*That bastard.* The subtle emphasis he put on 'difficult time' made my cheeks heat. Was he referring to the drugging incident or my public humiliation at The Plaza? Either way, the knowing look in his eyes made me want to throw something at his stupidly handsome face.

"Well," Grandpa's voice carried a hint of curiosity now. "Isn't that interesting?"

I could feel my carefully constructed composure cracking under Brandon Stark's intense gaze. The familiar comfort'of Grandpa's study suddenly felt stifling, like the walls were closing in.

"Brandon," Grandpa's voice carried that particular warmth he reserved for his favorite students, "it's been too long since you've visited your old professor. And now that my granddaughter is back from Europe, this calls for a celebration." He turned to Parker, who still hovered near the doorway."Parker, please prepare dinner. Brandon and Summer will both be joining us." "Of course, Professor," Parker's expression remained perfectly professional,but I caught the slight twitch at the corner of his mouth. *Great. Even Parker's in on whatever this is.* "Professor, I wouldn't want to impose-" I started, but Grandpa waved away my protest with the same gesture he'd probably used to dismiss countless academic arguments.
"Nonsense! Brandon, you must stay. Summer just got back from managing Fortune Corp's European division. She's still adjusting to the time difference, aren't you,dear?"

Brandon's dark eyes flickered to my face, and I fought the urge to fidget under his scrutiny. "Miss Taylor seems rather surprised to see me here."

"To be honest, Mr. Stark," I couldn't keep the edge from my voice, "finding out you're my grandfather's student is... unexpected."

One corner of his mouth lifted in that infuriating half-smile. "Do you think we have any reason to deceive you about this?"

"Brandon," Grandpa cut in before I could respond, his voice carrying a hint of pride, "this is the granddaughter I've mentioned so often.She followed in your footsteps at Columbia, you know. Graduated with honors,and now she's already an Executive Director at Fortune Corp."

I wanted to sink into the leather armchair and disappear. *Was Grandpa actually bragging about me to Brandon Stark?* The same Brandon Stark who'd seen me at my absolute worst just days ago?

"Her workwith the European division has been particularly impressive,"Grandpa continued, either oblivious to or deliberately ignoring my discomfort. "The quarterly reports show significant improvement under her management." Brandon's expression remained unreadable, but something in his eyes made my skin prickle. "Indeed. Very... impressive.""Well," Grandpa suddenly pushed himself up fom his chair, "you young people should chat. I need to organize some important documents in my study."

*What?* My head snapped up. "Grandpa-"

"Summer, be a good host to Brandon. He's my most brilliant student, you know." With that parting shot, Grandpa disappeared through the study door, leaving me alone with the last person I wanted to be alone with.
The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words. I could feel Brandon's gaze on me, as tangible as a physical touch. *Don't fidget. Don't show weakness.* "So, Mr. Stark," I kept my voice carefully neutral, "Which year were you Grandpa's student?" *And how have I never heard about Brandon Stark being his student before?*

He studied me for a moment, that hint of amusement playing at the corners of his mouth. "I graduated before you started. I was fifteen when I entered Columbia."

*Fifteen?* I tried not to let my surprise show, but failed miserably. "You were a child prodigy?" *Of course he was. Because being the most powerful man on Wall Street wasn't impressive enough.*

"The Professor didn't mention that either?" His voice held a note of genuine curiosity. "Interesting, considering how frequently he talks about you." Something about the way he said it made me wonder what exactly Grandpa had been saying. Before I could pursue that thought, Brandon rose from his chair with that fluid grace that seemed to come so naturally to him. My pulse quickened as he moved to sit beside me on the antique Chesterfield sofa-much closer than strictly necessary. *God, this man.* I fought the urge to bolt from the sofa like a startled deer."Mr. Stark, could you please keep your distance?"
His dark eyes held mine with that unsettling intensity. *Why does he have to look at me like that? Like he's trying to read every thought in my head.*The weight of his gaze made my skin prickle with awareness.

"Professor Thompson clearly thinks highly of you. Perhaps we should get to know each other better, as he seems to wish."

*Yeah, right. Because the CEO of Stark Group just happens to want to 'get to know' his old professor's granddaughter. The same granddaughter who's currently the talk of Wall Street for all the wrong reasons.* I fought back a hysterical laugh. This whole situation felt like some bizarre dream-or nightmare.

"Mr. Stark." I kept my voice professionally detached despite our proximity,proud that it didn't betray the nervous flutter in my stomach. "I appreciate that you're my grandfather's former student, but that doesn't require us to become... acquainted."*And I definitely don't need another Wall Street titan complicating my life right now.*

A slight smile played at the corners of his mouth. "You're making assumptions about my intentions, Miss Taylor."
"And you're making assumptions about my interest in any sort of acquaintance," I countered, trying to maintain my composure despite how his presence seemed to fill the entire room. *Why does he have to sit so close? The sofa's huge- there's literally no reason for him to be practically breathing down my neck,* My fingers twisted nervously in my lap,betraying the calm I was trying so hard to project. *Focus,Summer.Don't think about that night. Don't think about waking up naked in his room, or the way he carried you, or...* I cut that thought off abruptly. *Nope. Not*What the hell?* I pressed my hands against his chest, trying to push him away.
###Chapter 9: Don't Wear Such Heavy Makeup Next Time
**Summer's POV**

My hands trembled slightly against Brandon's chest as I tried to maintain some distance between us. Through the expensive fabric of his suit, I could feel the steady rhythm of his heartbeat, completely at odds with my own racing pulse.

His dark eyes studied my face with an intensity that made my skin prickle.Then, without warning, his hand came up to touch my cheek. The contact sent an electric shock through my system, and I froze.

"Don't wear such heavy makeup next time," he said, his deep voice carrying an edge I couldn't quite identify. "It doesn't suit you."

The words hit a nerve I didn't even know was exposed. After everything that had happened - the betrayal, the public humiliation,the gossip-how dare he comment on my appearance? "Are you crazy?" I snapped,anger giving me the strength to finally push away from him. "Since when do you get to dictate what makeup I wear? I'll wear it as heavy as I want!"

I stood up abruptly, nearly stumbling in my haste to put some distance between us. "I should check on Grandpa!"

His eyes followed my retreat, that infuriating half-smile playing at the corners of his mouth. *God, I hate how he looks at me like that -like he knows something I don't.* I knocked on the door to Grandpa's private study, trying to calm my racing heart. "Grandpa? Can I come in?"

"Come in, dear!" His warm voice helped steady my nerves.

The familiar scent of old books and leather enveloped me as I entered.Grandpa sat in his favorite armchair, surrounded by stacks of papers and leather-bound volumes. Just seeing him there, exactly as he'd always been,made something in my chest ache.

"Come here, sweetheart." He patted the space beside his chair, and I went willingly,grateful for any excuse to be away from BrandIon's unsettling presence.

"What are you reading?" I peered at the book in his hands, then reached over to close it. "I finally come to visit you, and not only do you invite a stranger, but you hide away in here?"

Grandpa tapped my forehead gently. "You silly girl!" He sighed, his expression growing more serious. "Do you know who Brandon really is?"

"Of course I know who he is, Grandpa." I couldn't keep the edge from my voice. "Everyone on Wall Street knows Brandon Stark. But why didn't you ever mention he was your student?"

"You were just a child then. Brandon was my most brilliant student - after graduating Harvard, he went to London, so it's natural you haven't mnet him before."Something in his tone made me wary. I knew that look in his eyes - it was the same one he got right before launching into one of his famous lectures.He took my hand in his, his grip still strong despite his age. "Dear, what do you think about Brandon? I think he's quite remarkable.If..." "Stop right there." I pulled my hand away. "Grandpa, what do you think I am? Some clearance item to be sold off?"
"Oh? Using business terms now, are we?" His eyes twinkled with amusement. "Even if you were a clearance item - which you're not-Brandon certainly isn't. I'm thinking of your happiness! These past few years... you think I don't know what happened just because you didn't tell me? I warned you about Alexander being unreliable, but you wouldn't listen."

"Grandpa!" I felt tears threatening to spill over, ruining my carefully applied makeup. "Stop! I... I just trusted the wrong person. Now I see clearly, and I won't make that mistake again."

"Alright, alright, let's not talk about that useless man anymore." He squeezed my hand. "Let's talk about Brandon. Summer, darling, I'm old.You're my only worry now. I don't care if you become rich or powerful-I just want you to be happy. Brandon... I know him. I trust him."

"But I..." The words stuck in my throat. How could I explain? That the mere thought of trusting someone again made me feel sick? That every time Brandon looked at me with those intense dark eyes, I felt like I was standing on the edge of something dangerous?

*How do I tell you, Grandpa, that your brilliant former student has already proposed to me? That he found me at my lowest point and offered marriage like he was suggesting lunch?* I just watched Grandpa reorganize the papers on his desk - a nervous habit he'd had for as long as I could remember. The familiar gesture made my throat tight. Here was the man who'd supported me through everything, and now he was trying to play matchmaker with Brandon Stark of all people. *I mean, come on - I just got my heart broken, I'm not that desperate.*The thought came with a flash of indignation. *If I wanted to date, I'm sure there would be plenty of men interested in me. And seriously, I just turned down Brandon's proposal not long ago. What must he think of me now, with my own grandfather trying to set us up? God, this is mortifying.*

The leather armchair creaked as I shifted. Afternoon sunlight streamed through the study windows, catching the dust motes dancing in the air.Everything about this room was exactly as it had always been - the wall of leather-bound books, the ancient desk Grandpa refused to replace, even the subtle scent of leather and old paper. It should have been comforting.Instead, it just reminded me how much everything else in my life had changed.

Through the study's half-open door, I heard Parker's efficient footsteps in the main hall. "Mr. Stark? Are you alone? Where are the Professor and Miss Summer?"

Brandon's deep voice carried clearly to where I sat. "Pretty sure Miss Taylor can't stand me right now."
###Chapter 10: Mr. Stark, Let Go of Me!


**Summer's POV**

I fought back a hysterical laugh. Something in his tone made me pause though-that hint of... what was it? Amusement? Challenge? The way he said it reminded me of a chess player contemplating his next move.*Don't flatter yourself. Brandon Stark. I'm not one of your Wall Street acquisitions.


I glanced at Grandpa, watching how the late afternoon light caught the silver in his hair. His eyes had that familiar thoughtful gleam - the same look he got when working out a particularly complex theorem. *God,please don't tell me he's trying to solve the equation of my love life.*

His hand squeezed mine gently, those professor's fingers still strong despite their age. The familiar gesture brought a lump to my throat. *How many times had those same hands dried my tears when I was little?*Before I could spiral further into memories, Grandpa cleared his throat,drawing my attention back to our conversation.

"Grandpa, I'll do anything you ask, but not this." My voice wavered slightly despite mny best efforts to keep it steady.


Grandpa's eyes held that partícular gleam I remembered from childhood-the one that meant he thought he knew what was best for me. "Summer,darling, Brandon is really-" "Grandpa!" I cut him off, perhaps more sharply than I'd intended. The mere mention of Brandon's name sent an uncomfortable flutter through my stomach. "Keep this up and I won't visit next time!" He sighed,his fingers drumming a familiar pattern on the arm of his chair. The gesture reminded me of countless afternoons spent here, seeking his advice on everything from calculus to college applications. But this-this was different. "You're being stubborn, child."
"I'm being sensible." I stood up, smoothing my skirt with trembling fingers."We should go back out. It's not polite to leave Mr. Stark alone in the living room." *Even if that's exactly where I'd like to leave him -preferably forever.*

"I hope you won't regret this..." Grandpa's voice carried equal parts affection and exasperation. The familiar tone made my throat tight.*Why does everything have to beso complicated?*

The walk back to the living room felt longer than it should have. Each step brought me closer to those dark eyes that seemed to see right through every defense I tried to put up. Brandon stood as we entered, that predatory grace making even the simple movement look dangerous.

"Professor." His deep voice seemed to fill the room, and I had to fight the urge to retreat back to the study.

"Brandon, my boy." Grandpa's tone carried a note of apology. "You rarely visit me, and I've been such a poor host.Well,let's have dinner."

I watched Parker efficiently set the dining room table, grateful for any excuse to avoid Brandon's intense gaze. The familiar routine of a formal dinner suddenly seemed like the most complicated dance in the world.*Just get through this. Smile, nod, and get out of here as fast as possible.* Parker had outdone himself with dinner - a perfectly grilled salmon that probably cost more than my monthly grocery budget, paired with roasted vegetables that looked like they belonged in a food magazine. But I could barely taste an y of it.Every bite felt like a challenge, especially with Brandon sitting directly across from me, those dark eyes catching mine whenever I dared look up.
*God, does he ever stop watching?* Ipushed a piece of asparagus around my plate, trying to look invested in the vegetable's journey rather than acknowledge the weight of his gaze. The way he ate was infuriating too -each movement precise and elegant, like everything else about him. *Even eating dinner has to be a power move with this man.*

"Summer, dear, you've hardly touched your food," Grandpa observed,making me jump slightly. "Is something wrong with the salmon?"

"No! No, it's perfect." I rushed to take a bite, nearly choking in my haste.Brandon's lips twitched slightly, and Ihad to resist the urge to throw my napkin at his stupidly handsome face. *Don't give him the satisfaction of knowing he affects you.*

"The wine is excellent, Professor," Brandon commented, his deep voice sending an involuntary shiver down my spine. "A '82 Bordeaux?"

"Ah, you have a good eye, my boy!" Grandpa beamed, launching into a story about how he'd acquired the bottle. I used the distraction to try to calm my racing heart, but then Brandon's leg brushed against mine under the table. The contact, brief as it was, felt like an electric shock. *This has to be deliberate,* I thought, shooting him a glare. He met my eyes with that infuriating half-smile, and I swear I could see the challenge in them.*Two can play at this game.* I straightened my spine and adopted my best boardroom smile - the one I used when dealing with particularly difficult clients. "Mr. Stark," I cut into their wine discussion with practiced sweetness, "how fascinating that you're so knowledgeable about wine. Do you often spend your evenings educating young ladies about vintage years?"

His dark eyes gleamed with something that looked dangerously like amusement. "Only the interesting ones."
Before I could formulate a suitably cutting response, his phone buzzed.He checked it with a slight frown, and for a moment, I dared to hope this might be my escape. *Please let it be some urgent Wall Street crisis.A market crash. Anything.*

"Brandon," Grandpa's voice carried a note that immediately set off warning bells in my head. "it's getting late. Would you mind driving Summer home?"

*No. No, no, no.* "Grandpa..." I started, but the words died in my throat as Brandon's lips curved into that infuriating half-smile.

"It would be my pleasure." The way he said it made it sound like so much more than a simple offer of transportation.

I scrambled for an excuse, any excuse. But under Grandpa's expectant gaze and Brandon's knowing smirk, I said nothing


The way out of my grandpa's place felt endless. Brandon's presencebeside me was like a physicalforce, drawing my attention no matter how hard I tried to ignore him. As soon as we stepped out onto the sidewalk, I turned to him. "Mr. Stark,please don't trouble yourself. I can take a cab." The words came out more breathless than I'd intended, betraying my nerves. His dark eyes studied my face with an intensity that made my pulse skip."Miss Taylor seems to really dislike me." A pause, heavy with implication. "Or perhaps... it's quite the opposite?" Heat flooded my cheeks - anger, definitely anger. Not embarrassment.Absolutely not anything else. "Don't flatter yourself, Mr.Stark. We're nothing to each other. Better keep it that way." I took astep back,trying to put some distance between us. "I'm sure you have other matters to attend to."

"Nothing urgent." He moved closer, erasing the space I'd created. "Besides,I promised your grandfather. A gentleman keeps his word." His hand caught my wrist, the touch sending electricity dancing across my skin. "And abandoning a lady midway isn't very gentlemanly, is it?"

The contact sparked something in me - panic, maybe, or defiance."Mr.Stark,let go of me!"
###Chapter 11: Who Just Drove You Home?


**Summer's POV**
"Miss Taylor." His deep voice seemed to fill the space between us."Sometimes you need to face what's inevitable. Don't you agree?"
I wanted to argue, to insist on my independence, but something in his expression told me this wasn't a battle I was going to win. *Fine. One car ride. What's the worst that could happen?* With a resigned sigh, Ilet him guide me to the waiting Bentley.

The interior felt like another world entirely. The soft leather seats probably cost more than my monthly salary, and the subtle scent of his new car leather made my head spin slightly. Or maybe that was just the effect of being trapped in an enclosed space with Brandon Stark.

I caught his reflection in the window - those dark eyes studying me with that same intense focus. *Don't engage. Just get through this ride.* "Left at the next light," I said instead of answering his question.

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly. "You're quite determined to ignore me."


"I'm quite determined to get home, Mr. Stark." I kept my voice professionally detached. "And I appreciate the ride, but that's all this is."

The Bentley glided to a smooth stop at a red light, and I could feel his gaze on me."Is it?" Something in his tone made me finally turn to look at him. The streetlights cast shadows across his face, highlighting those sharp cheekbones and the subtle curve of his lips. *God, why does he have to be so... Brandon Stark?*
"Mr. Stark." I fought to keep my voice steady. "Whatever game you're playing-"
"Game?" He cut me off, his voice carrying an edge that made my pulse jump. "Is that what you think this is?"

"What else would it be?" The words came out sharper than I'd intended. "You're Brandon Stark. You could have any woman in Manhattan.Why would you possibly-"

"Second light on the right?" he interrupted smoothly.

"Yes,but-"

"Then let's focus on getting you home safely." His tone brooked no argument. "We can discuss your fascinating theories about my motivations another time."

I bit back a frustrated reply and returned to staring out the window. The familiar buldings of my neighborhood came into view, and I felt some of the tension leave my shoulders. *Almost there. Just a few more minutes.*

The Bentley came to a stop in front of my building, the engine purring softly in the night air. Before I could reach for the door handle, Brandon's voice stopped me.

"My offer still stands, Miss Taylor. Call me when you're ready." I turned to face him, suddenly angry. "Mr. Stark, I'm sure half of Manhattan's eligible women would line up for a chance with you. Why waste your time on me?" His dark eyes held mine. "That's your perception, not mine."

"Mr. Stark." I gripped my bag tighter, needing something to ground me. "Thank you for the ride, but about your proposal - I'm sorry, I can't accept it. I just escaped one trap. I'm not looking to jump into another one."
Something flickered in his expression. "How can you be so sure it's a trap when you haven't given it a chance?" His voice softened slightly. "Nothing is absolute, Miss Taylor. It's late now, get some rest."

I practically fled from the car, my heels clicking against the pavement as I hurried toward the building entrance. The sound of the Bentley's engine fading into the night should have been reassuring. Instead, it left me feeling strangely hollow.

"Who was that in the car that just dropped you off? You can't just find yourself a random guy so soon!"

The voice hit me like a physical blow. *No. Not now. Not him.* I turned slowly, already knowing what I'd see. Alexander stood in the shadows of the building's entrance, his familiar face twisted with an expression I'd never seen before.

"I don't see how that's any of your business." I was proud of how steady my voice sounded, even as my heart threatened to beat out of my chest.

He took a step closer, and I fought the urge to back away. "How is it not my business? Summer, do you even realize what you're doing?" A bitter laugh escaped before I could stop it. "What *I'm* doing? That's rich,coming from you." "I understand this is hard for you to accept-Victoria and me." His tone carried that patronizing note I'd somehow never noticed before. "But you' re young, you'll find someone else. Look, I'm going to be your brother-in-law soon. I just want what's best for you."
The words hit like acid, burning through what little composure I had left."How thoughtful of you! Please, just do me a favor and stay out of my life."
"Summer, why are you being like this?" He ran a hand through his hair-a gesture I'd oncefound endearing. Now it just made me want to scream."What's done is done. Victoria and I - it's real love."

"Fine, I get it. You love Victoria." My voice cracked slightly. "What more do you want from me? I've already stepped aside. Why can't you just leave me alone?"

His expresson darkened. "Victoria's suffering because of you. Your grandfather won't approve our marriage. Don't you feel guilty about that?"

"Guilty?" The word exploded from me like a bullet. "Are you kidding me?The only ones who should feel guilty are you two. Now, get out of my sight. Oh god, I've got tired of keeping say that!"

But he didn't move. Instead, his eyes narrowed dangerously. "Who was that man? What did he say to you? You've changed."
###Chapter 12: Back to Wall Street

**Summer's POV**
Something snapped inside me. All the pain, all the betrayal,all the carefully contained fury of the past weeks came rushing out in a torrent."Changed? You mean I'm not your obedient ex-fiancée anymore? When you sent me to Europe for a year, claiming it was for my career growth-was that when you started seeing Victoria? Did you plan it all along? Get me out of the way so you two could be together?"

"Summer-"

"Leave!" The word exploded fromn me with enough force to make him flinch. "Leave now, or I swear I'll call security!"


\---

The weekend passed in a blur of wine, ice cream,and alternating waves of anger and despair. I'd spent Saturday morning aggressively cleaning my apartment, as if I could somehow scrub away the memories of Alexander and Victoria along with the kitchen counters. By Saturday night, I'd graduated to sitting on my balcony with a bottle of cabernet, mentally rewriting every conversation I'd ever had with my sister.

Sunday wasn't much better. I'd woken up with a headache and the kind of bone-deep exhaustion that came from crying yourself to sleep. Now it was Monday morning, and I had to face reality. I stood in front of Fortune Corp's gleaming glass entrance, trying to calm my racing heart. *Just breathe. In and out. You can do this.* My Louboutins clicked against the marble floor as I walked through the revolving door, head held high despite the whispers that followed in my wake. "That's her..."

"Can you believe she had the nerve to show up?"

The whispers weren't even trying to be subtle anymore. I kept my face carefully neutral, channeling every ounce of composure I'd learned in my years navigating Wall Street. *Let them talk. They don't know anything.*
"I heard Victoria saved her life when they were kids," a woman in Chanel whispered to her companion. "And this is how she repays her? By trying to steal her fiancé?"

*God, is there anyone in Manhattan who doesn't know about this mess?*I gripped my leather portfolio tighter, using the sensation to ground myself.The lobby suddenly felt endless, each step bringing a new wave of whispers and judgmental stares.

My steps faltered for just a moment before I caught myself. *Don't react.That's what they want.* I focused on my breathing, just like I used to before big presentations. *In through the nose, out through the mouth. You're Summer Taylor, and you didn't survive Columbia Business School to let these vultures see you crack.*

"Miss Taylor?"

I turned to find the front desk receptionist, looking at me with genuine concern in her eyes. Unlike the others,her expression held no judgment -just sympathy and something that might ha ve been respect. "The whole street is talking about..." she hesitated, glancing around before continuing in a lower voice. "You should be prepared. It's...not good." A genuine smile tugged at my lips despite everything. In the cutthroat world of Wall Street, even small kindnesses felt like lifelines. "Thank you. Do you...do you believe what they're saying about me?"

She met my eyes steadily. "Miss Taylor, I've worked this desk for three years. I've seen how you treat people, how you work. I don't believe those rumors for a second."

Before I coud respond, a particularly loud voice cut through the lobby."Stealing her sister's fiancé and still acting so shameless? She's a disgrace to Wall Street."

I watched Amy's face flush with anger on my behalf, and something in my chest tightened. "It's okay," I said softly. "Let them talk. The truth has a way of coming out eventually."




The boardroom felt like a shark tank as I walked in for the Monday morning meeting. Every face turned to watch my entrance,expressions ranging from barely concealed curiosity to outright hostility. *Welcome back to Wall Street, Summer.*

I took my usual seat, arranging my materials with deliberate precision.The European division's quarterly reports sat in frontof me like a shield.*Let them try to question my professional capabilities. Numbers don't lie.*

"Well, well." Lawrence's voice dripped with condescension. "Some people seem to have no shame, showing their faces at board meetings after disgracing themselves in front of all of Wall Street." I kept my eyes on my reports, my voice steady and professional. "I wasn't aware that Wall Street's elite had nothing better to discuss than personal matters. Should we review last quarter's portfolio performance instead?" His face reddened slightly. "The European numbers look impressive. One has to wonder what... methods were used to achieve such results."

"Questioning my methods, Mr. Lawrence?" I met his eyes directly now,letting a hint of steel enter my voice. "Perhaps we should compare our respective investment strategies? I believe my return rates speak for themselves."

A ripple of uncomfortable shifting went through the room. Lawrence's track record was notably less stellar than he liked to pretend, and everyone knew it.

"Now see here-" he started, but the boardroom door opening cut him off.

Alexander and his father Old Mr. Alexander Stark walked in together,and the air in the room seemed to thicken instantly. I kept my expression neutral, though my hands clenched beneath the table. *Professional.Stay professional.*

"Good morning,everyone." Old Mr. Stark's voice carried that familiar note of authority. His eyes skimmed over me as if I didn't exist, focusing instead on the papers in front of him. "Shall we begin?"

I straightened my spine, pulling up the European division's numbers on the projection screen. If they wanted to judge me, fine. But they'd have to do it based on my work, not their gossip.

"The European market presented several unique challenges this quarter,"I began, my voice clear and confident. "However, our strategic adjustments resulted in a 15% increase in portfolio value..." As I walked them through the data, I could feel the room's energy shifting.Whatever they thought of my personal life, these numbers were impossible to dismiss. Even Lawrence's attempts to find fault grew increasingly desperate.
"These returns are unprecedented for that market sector," he tried one last time. "It seems...suspicious."
I allowed myself a small smile. "Actually, Mr. Lawrence, if you'll turn to page 47 of your packet, you'll find a complete breakdown of our methodology. Every transaction is fully documented and verified by our compliance team. Unless you're suggesting that all of London's financial oversight committees are somehow compromised?"

A few poorly hidden smirks appeared around the table. Lawrence's face turned an interesting shade of purple.
###Chapter 13: Her Photos

**Brandon's POV**
The morning sun cast long shadows across my office on the 27th floor of Stark Tower, highlighting the subtle grain of my mahogany desk. I'd been here since dawn, reviewing quarterly reports that could have waited,but sleep had become an elusive companion lately. My thoughts kept drifting to a pair of defiant eyes and the subtle tremor in her voice when she'd told me she wouldn't marry me.

A knock at the door interrupted my musings. "Come in."

James entered with his usual efficiency, a stack of reports in his arms."Good morning, Mr. Stark. The financial statements from last month."

I nodded, not looking up from the document I'd been pretending to read."Go on."

"The marketing department has significantly exceeded their budget.Finance is requesting your decision on-"

"James." I cut him off, finally meeting his gaze. "Why are you bringing this to me?"


He hesitated, just for a moment. In the decade he'd worked for me.I'd learned to read those microscopic shifts in his expression. "Sir, given the scale of the overrun-" "I hired competent people to manage these departments." I leaned back in my chair, studying him. "Let them do their jobs. If it's within acceptable parameters, I don't need to know about it." "Of course, sir." He adjusted his stance slightly - another tell. There was something else.

"What is it?"

"Miss Taylor went to Fortune Corp today."

My fingers stilled on the pen I'd been holding. *Summer.* "And?"

"The rumors..." James paused, choosing his words carefully. "They're saying she tried to steal her sister's fiancé. Lawrence and several board members have been particularly vocal about it. Some of the staff were overheard discussing her... methods of achieving success in Europe."
Something cold settled in my chest. *Of course they would attack her reputation. It's what vultures do.* "Continue."

"She handled herself well in the morning meeting, sir. But the whispers continue."

"This is her complete background file." He placed a thick folder on my desk with characteristic precision.

I waited until he finished his other updates before issuing the order that had been forming in my mind since her last rejection. "Reduce Fortune Corp's investment allocation."

"By how much1,sir?"

"Enough to make them nervous." *Let's seehow Alexander handles that.* James nodded and retreated, leaving me alone with the folder that seemed to pulse with possibility on my desk. I waited exactly thirty seconds after the door clicked shut before reaching for it. The file was comprehensive -birth records, school transcripts, medical history,financial records. James's thoroughness never disappointed. But it was the photographs that caught my attention. Professional headshots from various stages of her career, casual snapshots from social media,family events...
Then I saw it. A photo from Columbia, dated three years ago.Summer and Alexander, standing together on the campus lawn. His arm around her waist, her smile bright and unguarded. The lighting caught her profile perfectly,highlighting the gentle curve of her smile. Something about that smile...

I forced myself to breathe, to examine this visceral reaction with the same analytical precision I applied to market trends. This... irritation at seeing her with Alexander was unexpected. Inconvenient.

Something dark and possessive twisted in my chest. Without hesitation,I tore the photo cleanly in half, separating the sisters. Victoria's half went straight into the trash. Summer's portion, I carefully slid into my wallet,right behind my business cards. *Mine.*

The next photo in the stack showed Summer alone, caught in a candid moment at what appeared to be a charity gala. Her head was turned slightly,profile illuminated by warm lighting, a small smile playing at her lips.

"James." I didn't raise my voice-I never needed to.

He appeared instantly, as if he'd been waiting. He probably had been. "I want Victoria Taylor's complete file. Everything. Especially anything involving Summer." "How soon,sir?" Thirty minutes."
His expression didn't change, but I caught the slight tightening around his eyes. Getting that much information that quickly would be challenging,even for him. "Yes,sir."
I returned to the file, examining the sections about Summer's family dynamics. The patterns were... interesting. The strained relationship with her mother Elizabeth, the complex dynamic with Victoria,the way she'd moved out of the family mansion years ago. But through it all, one connection remained strong-her relationship with Professor Thompson.

*My old mentor. Her beloved grandfather.* The coincidence was too perfect not to use.

A paragraph about a childhood incident caught my eye - something involving Victoria saving Summer's life. *That explains the hold she has over her.* I made a mental note to dig deeper into that particular story.

My phone buzzed with a message from James: "Meeting with Mr. Lee for expedited assistance."

Closing the file, I let my gaze drift to the city skyline beyond my office windows. Somewhere out there, Summer was probably sitting in her office at Fortune Corp, dealing with the whispers and stares that Alexander's betrayal had generated.

*Let them talk,* I thought, my fingers brushing over the photo in my wallet. *Soon enough, they'll have something else entirely to whisper about.*


The intercom buzzed. "Sir? Mr. Lee's team has begun the investigation.The preliminary information about Miss Victoria Taylor will be ready in twenty minutes."

"Good." I didn't bother responding further.

I turned back to the window, watching the morning sun glint off neighboring skyscrapers. The Taylor sisters... such an interesting study in contrasts. Victoria, the favored daughter, perfectly groomed for high society.And Summer...
The memory of her defiant eyes as she rejected my proposal brought an unexpected smile to my lips. *You can run all you want, Summer Taylor.But I've never lost something I truly wanted.*

And I wanted her.
###Chapter 14: Changes

*Summer's POV**
The pristine glass walls of Fortune Corp felt different somehow.Maybe it was the way the morning light hit them, or maybe it was just me. A year in Europe had changed more than just my perspective- it had changed everything I'd once taken for granted. *Even the familiar scent of coffee from the break room seems foreign now,* I thought, adjusting my grip on my bag. The weight of my laptop inside felt like armor against whatever was waiting for me.

My heels clicked against the marble floor as I made my way through the investment division. The sound echoed differently now, like a stranger's footsteps in a place that used to feel like home. New faces looked up as I passed, their expressions a careful mix of curiosity and calculation. *Where are all the familiar faces?*

Sarah's desk - the one by the window where she'd worked for several years-now belonged to someone I didn't recognize. Mark's corner office had a new nameplate: "Daniel Cooper, Senior Investment Manager." Even Lisa, my friend in this office for three years who knew exactly how I liked my coffee,was gone.

*This isn't a coincidence.* My fingers tightened around my portfolio as the realization sank in. One or two personnel changes were normal in a year,but this? This was a systematic purge. *They've been planning this,haven't they? Methodically r emoving everyone loyal to me while I was toofar away to notice.* A polished voice interrupted my thoughts, the tone carrying just enough warmth to seem friendly while remaining professionally distant I turned to find myself facing a woman about my age, dressed in a perfectly tailored suit that probably cost more than most people's monthly salary. Her smile was professional, but something in her eyes reminded me of a cat watching a particularly interesting mouse. *Victoria used to look at me the same way,* Irealized with a jolt. *Right before she'd take something that was mine.*
"Miss Morgan." I kept my voice neutral, professional, even as my stomach tightened with instinctive wariness. "I've heard about your work while I was away." *And about how quickly you aligned yourself with Alexander's interests,* I added silently.

"These are the investment project reports from the past six months." She handed me a thick folder. "Considering you've been in Europe for a year.you might need some time to catch up on headquarters operations. I've prepared detailed materials for your reference."

*Really? How thoughtful of you to remind me that you've been running my department.* The folder felt heavy in my hands, weighted with implications and hidden agendas. I accepted it with a smile that didn't quite reach my eyes, one I'd perfected during countless Wall Street negotiations. "Thank you, Miss Morgan. That's very thorough of you.After all, this is part of your job description."

Something flickered in her expression -annoyance,maybe,or frustration at my lack of reaction. "If there's anything unclear, feel free to ask me. I've been managing all the investment projects this past year."

"Is there anything else, Miss Morgan?" I met her gaze steadily, refusing to be baited. She smiled ágain, all perfect teeth and calculated warmth that never reached her eyes. "Actually, I was thinking we should organize a department dinner tonight? With so many new faces, it would be good for everyone to get better acquainted." Her tone suggested she was doing me a favor, but her eyes held a predator's focus.
The invitation hung in the air between us like a carefully laid trap.*A dinner where I'd be surrounded by Alexander's people, watching them size me up and report back to him? Where every word I say would be dissected and twisted? No thank you.* My chest tightened at the thought of sitting through hours of fake smiles and veiled insults.

"What's wrong, Miss Taylor?" Her tone carried just a hint of challenge.

"I apologize, but my schedule is quite full at the moment." I gave her my best boardroom smle. "I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint everyone."

Before she could respond, a familiar figure appeared at my office door -Old Mr. Stark's secretary, looking as eficiently unreadable as ever. "Miss Taylor? Mr. Stark would like to see you."

"I'll be right there." I nodded at Katherine. "If you'll excuse me,Miss Morgan."

As I followed the secretary toward the executive floor, memories from my last board meeting washed overme. The way Alexander had barely looked at me,how Old Mr. Stark had treated me like a stranger... *God, what a difference a year makes.* I remembered the day Old Mr. Stark had first hinted at a potential marriage between Alexander and me. He'd praised my work ethic,my Columbia education, my family background, his eyes twinkling with paternal warmth. *"You remind me of my late wife,"* he'd said, his eyes warm with approval as he'd studied my face. *"She had that same spark."*Back then, those words had filled me with pride and belonging. Now those same eyes would probably look at me with carefully masked disdain. After all, I was the scandal of Wall Street-the jilted fiancée who'd dared to curse her sister's engagement. The thought made something bitter twist in my stomach.
The secretary gestured to the familiar oak doors. I took a deep breath,straightened my spine, and knocked.

"Come in."

Old Mr. Starksat behind his massive mahogany desk, the Wall Street Journal spread out before him like a judge's verdict. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows behind him, turning him into a silhouette of power and authority. He looked up as I entered, and for a moment, I caught a glimpse of that old warmth in his smile, like an echo of happier times. "Summer, please, have a seat."

"Mr. Stark." I remained standing, maintaining a professional distance."You wanted to see me?"
###Chapter 15: Bribery

**Summer's POV**
"Summer," his voice carried that practiced warmth I'd once found so paternal. "It's been over a year. How are you finding things after Europe?"
I kept my expression professionally neutral, channeling every lesson I'd learned in Columbia's negotiation classes. *Deep breaths. Channel your inner ice queen.* "Everything's fine, Mr. Stark. The European division's performance speaks for itself."

His eyes narrowed slightly at my formal tone. A year ago, I would have called him "Uncle Alex" - the way he'd insisted when Alexander first introduced us. *God, I was so naive back then.*

"Yes, the numbers are... impressive." He shuffled some papers on his desk,though I knew it was just for show. Old Mr. Stark never needed to check numbers - he remembered everything, It was one of the first things Alexander had warned me about. *Another red flag I chose to ignore.*"But that's not why I called you here."

"Oh?" I kept my voice light, professional, even as my stomach twisted with dread. "Is there an issue'with the quarterly reports?"

He sighed, setting aside the pretense of paperwork. "Summer, we need to discuss you and Alexander." "My grandfather specifically asked me not to return yet." The lie slipped out smoothly, but I kept my face straight. *Sorry,Grandpa George,but I need this excuse.* My heart twisted a little at using my grandfather's name this way, but desperate times called for desperate measures. "Mr. Stark." I cut him off before he could continue, my voice sharp enough to make him blink. The mere mention of Alexander's name sent a wave of nausea through me. "This is a work environment. And I have nothing to discuss regarding Alexander." *Nothing except how he and my sister stabbed me in the back,but somehow I doubt that's what you want to hear. "Don't be difficult." His tone hardened slightly. "You know Victoria and Alexander's engagement has put us all in an... awkward position."
*Awkward position?* I had to bite back a bitter laugh. *Is that what we're calling it when your son betrays his fiancée with her own sister? When my entire life gets torn apart and rewritten without my consent?*
"The only awkward position," I said carefully, gripping the arms of my chair to keep my hands from shaking, "is you trying to discuss personal matters during office hours."

His expression darkened. "Have you even been back to the Taylor house since returning? Your family is worried."

I had to hold back a bitter laugh. *Now* I understood his game. Victoria had always been the golden child - after all, Father had given her a 15%stake in the company as her coming-of-age present. And me? I couldn't even get a decent position in the company, let alone any shares. The unfairness of it allburned in my chest like acid.

*Talk about double standards.* When I graduated, Mother had insisted I find my own job, claiming it would build character and teach me independence. Everything I owned paled in comparison to Victoria's possessions. Sometimes I couldn't help but wonder if I was even truly a Taylor at all. *Maybe I was switched at birth. That would explain so much.* "George saidI that?" Something calculated flickered in his eyes. "His birthday celebration is coming up soon. Next week,surely you'll attend?"
I frowned, my stomach tightening. If there was anyone in the Taylor family I truly cared about, it was my paternal Grandpa George. Old Mr.Stark's sudden interest in my family reconciliation had nothing to do with concern for me - he just wanted me to sweet-talk my grandfather into accepting Alexander and Victoria's marriage. *Nice try, but I'm not your puppet anymore.*

"Of course I'll attend my grandfather's birthday." I kept my voice steady,professional, even as anger burned through my veins. "Was there something specific about work you needed to discuss,Mr.Stark?"

He leaned forward, his voice dropping to that conspiratorial tone he used when offering particularly lucrative deals. The same tone he'd used when he first suggested I date Alexander. *Fool me once, shame on you...*"Summer, be reasonable. This situation benefits no one. Just... put in a good word with George about Victoria and Alexander's marriage. Make things smoother for everyone." His smile turned indulgent,like he was offering me a special treat. "I could ensure your promotion to Managing Director in return."

The blatant attempt at bribery made my stomach turn. *So this is what I'm worth to them - a promotion in exchange for helping Victoria steal my life.*The realization felt like swallowing broken glass. "Mr. Stark, are you trying to buy my cooperation with a job title?" circle?"*Family unity - is that what we're calling betrayal these days?* "Don't be crude." His mask slipped slightly, showing a flash of irritation that reminded me so much of Alexander it made my chest ache."I'm offering you an opportunity. Victoria's already received her 15% stake in Capital Corp. Surely you understand the importance of family unity in our "Mr. Stark." I stood up, smoothing my skirt with hands that wanted to shake. "If there's nothing else, I have reports waiting."
"Sit down!" The command cracked through the air like a whip. "You're being unreasonable. This attitude of yours - this is exactly why Elizabeth pushed for you to move out. You never could understand your place in the family."
*My place.* Something cold and hard crystallized in my chest. Years of swallowed hurt and forced smiles solidified into diamond-hard resolve."My place, Mr. Stark? You mean the place where I watch my sister take everything that's mine while smiling gratefully? The place where I trade my self-respect for a promotion?"*The place where I'm supposed to thank you all for treating me like dirt?*

"You ungrateful-" He cut himself off, visibly trying to regain his composure.His face was turning an interesting shade of red. "Summer,think carefully about your next moves. Fortune Corp isn't just any company. Your position here..."

I was done listening to his bullshit. I turned and walked out, my heels clicking against the hardwood floors with military precision. Each step felt like a small victory, even as my heart hammered against my ribs. I made it all the way to my office before my hands started to shake.
###Chapter 16: Ms. Taylor, You'd Like My Help Choosing A Gift?
**Summer's POV**
The smile his words brought to my face faded as soon as I ended the call.*Home.* The word felt different now, heavy with complications I'd never noticed before. Last time I'd been at the Taylor mansion... *No. Don't think about that now.* "Summer." Two days before Grandfather's birthday party, my quiet morning at Fortune Corp was interrupted by a familiar ringtone.
Grandpa George's voice on the phone carried that familiar warmth that always made my heart ache a little. "Come home, dear. Whatever's troubling you, I will stand by your side."

I gripped my phone tight. *I know avoiding things won't soIve anything.No matter what happens, I'm still a member of the Taylor family.* "Of course I'll come, Grandpa. You've always been my strongest support. And how could I miss your birthday? I wasn't here last year - I have to make it up to you properly this time."

"Just having you home is enough." His' tone held a hint of worry that made me feel guilty. "Don't worry about the formalities."

"No way!" I tried to inject some cheerfulness into my voice. "I'm definitely getting you a present that will make you smile."

There was a pause, and I could almost see him shaking his head with that fond exasperation he reserved just for me. "You stubborn child."
###Chapter 16: Ms. Taylor, You'd Like My Help Choosing A Gift?

*Speaking of complications.* Despite my best efforts to avoid Alexander over the past few days, he still managed to find me. I'd carefully timed my movements around the office, taking different routesand skipping the usual lunch spots, but here he was anyway. And I didn't need to turn around to recognize his voice. "I'm working." I kept my eyes fixed on my computer screen, though the quarterly  Christie's elegant interior felt like stepping into another world. The soft lighting caught on glass display cases, making the antiques within gleam with quiet dignity. I wandered between the exhibits, trying to focus on finding the perfect gift for Grandpa rather than the hollow ache in my reports had blurred into meaninglesspatterns.
"We need to talk." His tone carried that particular note of patronizing concern that made my skin crawl. "You can't keep avoiding this conversation forever."
"Actually, I can." I started gathering my things, determined to maintain my composure. "And I will."

"Can't we at least be friends?" The way he said it - like he was being so reasonable, so mature about everything - made something twist painfully in my chest.

"Friends? Seriously?" *He's definitely kidding me.*

His expression shifted to something almost guilty. "Summer, the day after tomorrow is your grandfather's birthday. Victoria and I really want you to come home."


"I will be there." The words came out sharp. "But not for you. Not for her." "Can I help you find something specific, miss?" A sales specialist materialized at my elbow, her smile professional and practiced.
"I'd like to look around myself first, thank you." I tried to project confidence I didn't feel. Better not let them realize I have no idea what I'm doing. Last thing I need is to buy something that makes me look like an amateur in front of Grandpa. Everything looked valuable, but I couldn't tell what would truly catch Grandpa's eye. He had such specific taste in art and antiques - the kind that came from decades of passionate collecting.*Maybe I should have paid more attention during all those times he tried to teach me about them...*

The quiet murmur of conversation died suddenly, like someone had pressed a mute button on the room. I turned, already knowing what I'd find.*Who else could command that kind of attention just by walking into a room?*

Brandon Stark's tall figure cut an imposing silhouette against the evening light streaming through Christie's windows. His dark suit probably cost so much money, butit was the quiet authority in his bearing that drew every eye in the room. James and another man I didn't recognize flanked him like well-trained shadows.


Those dark eyes found mine immediately, and that familiar half-smile played at the corners o his mouth. My pulse jumped traitorously. *Get it together, Summer. He's just another Wall Street titan who happens to keep showing up everywhere,* "Mr. Stark!" The sales specialist who'd approached me earlier practically materialized at Brandon's side. "We've received an exceptional collection of antiques. As per your last request, we've set aside several pieces for your on."
Brandon's gaze never left my face as he addressed her. "Thank you. James will review them shortly." With a subtle gesture, he dismissed his entourage to the waiting area.
My fingers twisted nervously in the strap of my bag as he approached.The evening light caught the sharp angles of his face, somehow making him look even more dangerous than usual. *Why does he have to look like that? It's honestly unfair. Well... I had to admit that he's a bit... stunning.*
"Miss Taylor." His deepo voice carried just a hint of amusement. "What a pleasant surprise."

I straightened my spine, determined to maintain my composure."Mr.Stark. I didn't know you were interested in antiques."

"I know a little." The way he said it suggested he was being modest.Those dark eyes studied my face with unsettling intensity."You seem...lost."

*Was I that obviouas?* "No. I mean..." The words stuck in my throat.*Come on. Summer. Swallow your pride. This is for Grandpa.* "Actually,Mr.Stark,you are right."

One perfect eyebrow arched slightly."Oh?"

"It's my grandfather's birthday in two days." The words came out in a rush. "He's a serious collector, and I want to find something special, but I'm a bit..." I gestured helplessly at the displays around us. *I can't believe I'm actually asking for his help!*

"Ms. Taylor, you'd like my help choosing a gift?" That infuriating half-smile was back, making my stomach do odd flips.
###Chapter 17: A Private Viewing at Christie's


**Summer's POV**
"If it's not too much trouble?" I hated how uncertain my voice sounded."I know you must be busy..."
His dark eyes held mine for a long moment, and I fought the urge to fidget under that intense gaze. "Not at all, Miss Taylor. It would be my pleasure."

His dark eyes studied me with that unsettling intensity I was starting to recognize. "What kind of gift did you have in mind for Mr. Taylor?"

"Maybe a painting, or another suitable collection piece?" I kept my voice carefully casual, though my heart was doing odd little flips under his scrutiny. "Grandpa George has always loved collecting art. His taste is quite similar to Grandpa Jonathan's, actually." *There. A subtle hint about their shared interests. That should help him choose.*

Brandon's expression shifted almost imperceptibly. "James."

His assistant materialized beside us with that eerily efficient silence I was beginning to associate with him. "Yes, sir?"

"Have Christie's manager prepare the special collection."

I caught the flash of surprise that crossed James's face before he could mask it. His eyes darted to me for just a moment before quickly looking away. I offered a polite smile, more out of habit than anything else.

Brandon's brow furrowed slightly- the tiniest movement that nonetheless made James straighten his spine and school his features into perfect neutrality. "Right away, sir." James's voice was crisp and professional as he turned to carry out the order.
I watched Brandon lean against one of the display cases with casual grace,wondering how he managed to make even that simple action look like something from a luxury advertisement.
"Sir, everything is ready." James's voice broke through my thought.

Brandon's eyes found mine. "Please." He gestured toward a doorway I hadn't noticed before, his hand coming to hover near the small of my back without quite touching me.
The private viewing room took my breath away. If the main gallery was impressive, this space was extraordinary. Elegant wood paneling lined the walls, providing a perfect backdrop for costly artwork. The lighting was perfectly calibrated to showcase each piece, creating an atmosphere of hushed reverence.

I was so caught up in examining a particularly striking oil painting that I almost missed the sound of the door closing. When I turned, I realized James and the Christie's manager had disappeared, leaving me alone with Brandon. The room suddenly felt much smaller.

"My grandfather has a rare early Monet in his collection," I said quickly,desperate to fill the loaded silence. Then I made the mistake of meeting Brandon's gaze. The intensity in those dark eyes made my pulse skip, and I quickly looked away, heat creeping up my neck. "Oh... where did James and the manager go?" "See anything you like?" He didn't answer my question. "I... not yet. I'm not very familiar with fine art." I hated how breathless I sounded. "Perhaps you could walk me through these pieces,Mr.Stark?"

A rare smile tugged at his lips, transforming his usually stern features into something that made my heart do a complicated gymnastics routine in my chest. *God, he should come with a warning label when he does that.*
"Mr. Stark?" I prompted when he didn't respond immediately, trying to ignore how the roomn's intimate lighting seemed to soften the sharp angles of his face.
"My pleasure," The words rolled off his tongue like velvet, dark and rich with promise. A little pause, then: "Let me show you something."
I followed him to a wall where several paintings hung in perfect lighting.His arm brushed mine as he gestured to a particularly striking piece,and I had to suppress a shiver at the contact.

"Early 18th century," he explained, his deep voice taking on a scholarly tone that somehow made him even more attractive. "Notice the brushwork here." His hand traced the air just above the canvas,drawing my attention to subtle details I would have missed.

*Focus on the art, not his hands,* I told myself firmly. But it was impossible not to notice how those elegant fingers moved with such precision, how his whole demeanor shifted when discussing the artwork.


"The artist was relatively unknown in his time," Brandon continued, "but his technique was revolutionary. See how the light falls across the landscape?" He leaned closer, "It creates a depth that was unusual for that period." "It's beautiful," I managed, though I wasn't entirely sure if I was talking about the painting or the way his eyes lit up with genuine passion as he explained its significance.
Then he surveyed the room slowly, his movements deliberate and graceful.When his gaze settled on something near the far wall, I followed his line of sight to a chess set displayed in an antique case.
The chess set was breathtaking - each piece crafted in pure silver, the workmanship so fine it looked almost alive. A small placard identified it as a 19th-century piece from the British Royal Collection. Just looking at it made my palms sweat.*That's probably worth more than my entire apartment building.*
"Does Professor Taylor enjoy chess?" Brandon's question was casual,but something in his tone made me look up sharply.
I couldn't quite hide my awe at the chess set, but practicality won out."That's... that's far too extravagant. Perhaps we should look at something else?"

His lips curved into that infuriating half-smile that never failed to make my pulse race. "Too extravagant for your grandfather? Or for you,Miss Taylor?"

The way he said my name - soft but somehow intense - made me acutely aware of how alone we were in this beautiful room full of priceless treasures. *Focus, Summer. You're here to buy a gift, not get lost in Brandon Stark's eyes. Even if they do look particularly dangerous in this lighting.* I moved toward a collection of smaller paintings, putting some much-needed distance between us. "Mr. Stark, I appreciate your help, but I'm looking for something... reasonable." *Something that won't make me feel like I'm accepting another form of proposal.* "Reasonable." He repeated the word like he was tasting it,finding it wanting."An interesting choice of word, Miss Taylor."
###Chapter 18: Walking Into His Trap

**Summer's POV**

I followed him around the room, listening as he explained the significance of various artworks. His knowledge was impressive, but what caught me off guard was his obvious passion for the subject. This wasn't the cool,calculating CEO of Stark Group- this was someone who genuinely loved art and its history.

"You know so much about all of this,"I remarked as he finished explaining the historical context of a particularly valuable sculpture.

"Art tells us about more than just beauty," he replied, his voice taking on that velvet-soft quality that made my skin prickle. "It tells us about desire,obsession, the lengths people will go to possess something they consider precious."

*Why do I feel like we're not just talking about art anymore?* "That's quite philosophical,Mr.Stark."

Brandon's eyes held that dangerous glint I was starting to recognize all too well as he swept his hand across the private viewing room. "So, that piece?Or perhaps the Royal Collection chess set? I think they are both quite good.-


We were standing close enough that I had to tilt my head back to meet his eyes. "Your grandfather would appreciate the historical significance of that piece," he said softly. "But this piece has another interesting feature." "Oh?" My voice came out embarrassingly breathy. Brandon's lips curved into that dangerous half-smile. "The artist painted it for the woman he loved. It's said he spent months perfectingevery detail,wanting to capture the exact way light fell across the hills near her home."

The intensity in his dark eyes made my pulse race. "That's... quite romantic," I said, trying to keep my voice steady.

"Indeed." His eyes never left mine. "So, do you think that is a reasonable gift? No?"

I shook my head. "Mr. Stark, I-"

"There's more to see," he cut me off smoothly, already moving toward another display. *Okay, he must have known that I simply cannot afford them.*


His gaze traveled around the room before suddenly stopping. "Perhaps this would be more suitable."


I followed him to a display case, curious despite my better judgment.Inside sat what appeared to be a relatively simple fountain pen. The design was classic and elegant - exactly the kind of thing Grandpa George would appreciate. He'd always loved writing with fountain pens,claiming they gave his thoughts the proper weight on paper.

*Finally, something that doesn't look like it costs more than my apartment.*I studied the pen more closely, admiring how the light caught its understated gold accents. The craftsmanship was clearly exceptional, but in a way that spoke of quality rather than ostentation. "This one," I said firmly. "It's perfect for Grandpa." "Have it wrapped for Miss Taylor." Brandon's deep voice carried that note of absolute authority that seemed to make everyone around him snap to attention. The manager hesitated."This...um..."

"Is there a problem?" I asked, my stomach sinking. *Please don't let it be astronomically expensive. I've already blown through so much of my savings moving out of the family mansion.*

"No, no!" The manager's smile looked slightly strained as his eyes darted between Brandon and me. "If Miss Taylor likes it, I'll have it wrapped right away."

I watchedthe staff handle the pen with almost reverent care, which did nothing to ease my growing suspicion about its true value. *It's fine. I'm an Executive Director at Fortune Corp. I can handle this.* Even if I had to eat instant ramen for a month, Grandpa was worth it.

A familiar anxiety gnawed at my stomach - the same feeling I'd had when signing the lease for my new apartment. Every major purchase now came with a mental calculation of how many extra hours I'd need to work, how many luxuries I'd need to cut back on. Gone were the days when I could swipe the Taylor family credit card. *But isn't this better? No strings attached, no obligations, no having to smile and nod while Victoria gets everything handed to her on a silver platter.*

"Manager," I squared my shoulders, "how much is the pen?"

"Let James handle the payment details." Brandon's tone brooked no argument. My protests died in my throat as he turned those dark eyes on me. "Miss Taylor, after all my assistance today, perhaps you'd like to show your appreciation?" Heat crept up my neck. *Was this his plan all along?* "I... I could treat Mr. Stark to dinner?"

The smile that curved his lips made my heart do a complicated gymnastics routine. "I'd be delighted to accept Miss Taylor's invitation."

"But Mr. Stark, I haven't paid yet!" I protested weakly as he guided me toward the exit.


James materialized beside us with his usual eerie efficiency. "Miss Taylor,please go ahead with Mr. Stark. I'll handle everything here and arrange delivery of your gift. You can pay the bill later. It's all right."

As Brandon led me out of Christie's, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd just walked into an expertly laid trap. Everything had happened so smoothly,like pieces moving across a chessboard according to some master plan.

Brandon's hand at my elbow guided me through Christie's elegant doors and into the cool evening air. My mind was spinning with questions and suspicions, but something told me I wouldn't get straight answers even if I asked.


He stopped so suddenly I nearly ran into his back. "What are you thinking?"

I stumbled slightly, catching myself just before colliding with his impossibly expensive suit. "I... where would Mr. Stark like to have dinner?" His dark eyes studied my face with that intensity that never failed to make my pulse race. Something about his expression made me wonder if I'd just agreed to much more than a simple thank-you dinner. *What have I gotten myself into?*
###Chapter 19: It's Just You

*Summer's POV*

"Since it's your treat, Miss Taylor, it is naturally your choice." His deep voice carried just a hint of amusement.

I fought the urge to fidget with my bag strap. *God, what do you even suggest to someone like Brandon Stark? The places I usually eat probably don't even register on his radar.* "As long as you don't mind..." My voice trailed off uncertainly.

Something flickered in his expression - understanding.maybe,or something deeper. "Miss Taylor, you seem to have some misconceptions about me." His tone softened slightly. "I'm not as unapproachable as you might think." He made an elegant gesture toward the street. "Please."

The way he said it - like he was trying to put me at ease while simultaneously maintaining that aura of absolute control that seemed to come as naturally to him as breathing. *How does he do that? Make even a simple word soundI like both an invitation and a command?*

To my surprise, instead of the imposing Bentley from our first meeting, a sleek but relatively understated luxury car waited at the curb.*Ishe...trying to make me feel more comfortable?* The thought made something warm flutter in my chest. Brandon moved with that predatory grace to open the passenger door for me, waiting with surprising patience as I settled into the butter-soft leather seat. The door closed with a soft click that somehow managed to sound expensive, and I watched through the window as he rounded the hood to the driver's side. *Even walking to a car, he moves like he owns the whole street. Which, given this is Manhattan, he probably does.* He slid into the driver's seat with fluid elegance, the movement drawing my attention to the perfect cut of his suit. *Stop staring at him like a teenager with a crush,* I scolded myself, quickly looking away.

"Miss Taylor, please direct me."

"116th Street, thank you." I kept my voice steady, professional. *Just because he's being nice doesn't mean anything has changed. He's still Brandon Stark, and I'm still...*

"Near Columbia?" His question interrupted my spiral of self-doubt.

I turned to him in surprise, catching that familiar glint of amusement in his dark eyes. "Miss Taylor seems to have forgotten - I attended Columbia as well."

*Right. Of course he did.* The reminder of our shared alma mater somehow made the space between us feel both smaller and more charged.The soft glow from the dashboard caught the sharp angles of his face as he programmed the navigation system, and I had to force myself to look away.

We rode in comfortable silence for a while, the lights of Manhattan sliding past the windows like stars. The car's interior smelled faintly of leather and his perfume.

"It's been years since I've been back to Columbia," he said suddenly, his deep voice thoughtful, "I wonder how much it's changed." "You haven't visited?" The question slipped out before I could stop it,genuine curiosity overriding my usual caution. *I'm the sentimental type-whether it's people, places, or things, I get attached.* I thought about my own habits, how I made a point to visit several times a year, always stopping by the campus food trucks and small restaurants nearby to relive those carefree college days.

His expression shifted slightly, becoming more guarded. "Work keeps me busy. Besides, I'm not one to dwell on the past."

The way he looked at me as he said it - like the words carried some deeper meaning - made my heart skip a beat. I turned to watch the city lights blur past the window, trying to gather my thoughts. "Everyone has a past."

"True." His voice took on that velvet-soft quality that never failed to make my skin prickle. "But letting it control your present and future? That's a mistake, don't you think?"

"Mr. Stark, you should be a lawyer. Or maybe a therapist." I tried to inject some lightness into my voice, desperate to break the intensity of the moment.


One perfect eyebrow arched slightly. "Oh? Why is that?"

I studied his profile in the passing streetlights,gathering my thoughts."Your way with words," I said finally. "You have this way of making complicated things sound simple. When you talk about the past or the future... you make it sound like everything has a clear solution. Like life's big problems arejust... puzzles waiting to be solved." *God, I'm rambling.* But something about the quiet intimacy of the car, the way his presence seemed to fill the space without being overwhelming, made me want to keep talking. "It's... comforting, actually. Even when you're being infuriatingly cryptic." His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile I was starting to know too well. "Life is a series of puzzles. Miss Taylor." His deep voice carried an edge of intensity that made my skin prickle. "The key is knowing which ones are worth solving." The way his dark eyes flickered to me made it clear this wasn't just about metaphors anymore.

"Are you always like this?" The words came out more vulnerable than I'd intended, "I mean... when you are comforting someone else?"

His fingers tapped a gentle rhythm against the steering wheel as he considered his response. When he finally spoke, his voice carried a weight that made my breath catch. "No. There is no 'always."

I waited for him to elaborate, but he remained silent, those dark eyes focused on the road ahead. The city lights played across his sharp features,highlighting the perfect line of his jaw. *God, I hate his pause.*

"Mr.Stark-"

"And. there is no 'someone else'." He cut me off, his voice carrying that note of absolute certainty I was starting to associate with him. "It's just you.
###Chapter 20: Your Boyfriend Looks Amazing

Summer's POV

His words hung in the air between us, making my heart skip several beats. It's just you. The weight of those three simple words seemed to fill the entire car, and I found myself staring out the window, desperately trying to collect my thoughts.

"Mr. Stark," I said, desperate to break the loaded silence, "did you ever visit the food streets near Columbia when you were a student?"

He turned those dark eyes on me, one perfect eyebrow arching slightly. "Skipping classes?"

"What? No!" Heat flooded my cheeks. "We always went after classes!" The corner of his mouth lifted in a subtle, amused smile. He looked different here—more relaxed, almost approachable.

When we reached the campus, I led him toward a tiny, bustling eatery. "Oh! Someone's leaving!" Without thinking, I caught his sleeve to pull him toward the vacant table. When I realized the familiarity of my gesture, I quickly stepped back. "Is something wrong? We can go somewhere else if you think it's too... casual."

"No." He sat down before I could finish. "This is perfect."

"Summer!" The owner's enthusiastic voice made me jump. "Long time no see!" Her eyes darted between Brandon and me. "And who's this? Your boyfriend?"

"No, he's—" I started, but Brandon smoothly cut me off by handing me a menu.

"Shall we order?" His voice was perfectly calm, but there was a glint of mischief in his eyes.

We ordered the famous cheese steak sandwiches and herbal teas. As we waited, I could hear the whispers from nearby tables—mostly students marvelling at Brandon’s striking presence. In this setting, he stood out even more.

"See something you like?" He teased, catching me looking at him.

"Mr. Stark is being very confident," I countered.

The owner returned with our food, giving Brandon another appreciative look. "Your boyfriend is so handsome!"

"Thank you," he responded naturally, making my heart do a sudden flip.

I stared at my sandwich, which was nearly twice the normal size. "This is... excessive. They never give portions this big."

Brandon leaned back, his movements elegant even in this cramped space. "Perhaps good looks buy special treatment, Miss Taylor. Was that a compliment?"

"I was commenting on the restaurant's double standards!" I protested.

"So you agree that I am..." He paused deliberately. "Striking?"
###Chapter 21: When I Was in College, You Wer e Just a Little Girl
Summer's POV

"I didn't say that!" My face felt like it was on fire.

He leaned back, clearly enjoying the moment. "I believe your reaction says enough."

I stirred my tea, refusing to meet his amused gaze. We ate in a surprisingly comfortable atmosphere. "Wall Street titans don't usually grab cheese steaks at student hangouts," I remarked.

"And yet," his voice was low and resonant, "here I am."

The chime of a phone interrupted us. It was James, informing Brandon that my gift was ready.

"Where are you headed after this?" Brandon asked as we stood up.

"Home. You don't need to trouble yourself, Mr. Stark."

"That won't be necessary. I'll take you." The finality in his tone brooked no argument. He handled the bill with an efficient authority that made my protests die in my throat.

As we stepped outside into the golden autumn sunset, Brandon paused, looking at the campus architecture. "Would you like to walk for a bit?"

I was surprised but nodded. As we walked, I asked, "How come I've never seen you before? Which year were you?"

He looked at me with a rare, soft expression. "When I was in college, you were probably still a little girl. I entered at fifteen and only spent two years here. You would have been seven or eight."

I was shocked. "You were a child prodigy?"

A shadow passed over his face at the word. "Genius is a heavy word, Miss Taylor."

I suddenly remembered rumors Grandpa used to mention—about a brilliant student who left for London and never looked back. Was it Brandon?

When we reached the parking lot, James was waiting with a sleek black car and the gift. When I saw the bill James handed me, I froze. "This... there must be some mistake. This is far too cheap for Christie's."
###Chapter 22: Eavesdropping

Summer's POV

James cleared his throat. "Mr. Stark is a valued client, Miss Taylor. The store adjusted the price as a courtesy."

"James," Brandon’s voice was like a steel blade, silencing his assistant instantly. I realized Brandon had likely covered the majority of the cost himself.

"Mr. Stark, I can't accept—"

"Get in the car," he said, his long stride purposeful.

Fast forward to the day of Grandpa's birthday. I drove toward the Taylor mansion, my stomach in knots. The driveway was a sea of luxury cars—the Manhattan elite had arrived in force.

As I walked up the path, I heard voices behind a hedge. It was my parents.

"That ungrateful girl better not cause any trouble," my mother’s voice dripped with venom. "After everything we've done for her..."

"Lower your voice," my father warned. "We need Father’s approval for Victoria and Alexander's marriage. If Summer makes a scene..."

"Summer should be grateful anyone wanted to marry her at all!" Mother scoffed. "Victoria is doing her a favor by taking Alexander off her hands. She’s much better suited to the Stark family's expectations."

The blood drained from my face. My own mother saw me as a "burden" and my sister as a "solution."

Then my phone buzzed. It was my father. I answered, keeping my voice neutral.

"Summer, where are you?" His fake warmth was nauseating. "We're family. Come home and don't make your grandfather sad."

"I'll be there," I said coldly. "For Grandpa."

I hung up, my hands shaking. They weren't just celebrating a birthday; they were planning to manipulate my grandfather into endorsing the betrayal that ruined my engagement. They wanted to present Victoria and Alexander as the "perfect couple" while keeping me in the shadows.

Straightening my dress, I took a deep breath. I wasn't the broken girl they remembered. I walked toward the grand entrance with a new-found resolve. This party was going to be the reckoning they didn't see coming.

###Chapter 23: Family Reunion

**Summer's POV**

"Miss Summer!"

Jenkins's familiar voice made me turn. The old butler's face lit up with genuine warmth as he hurried toward me, his usual formal demeanor softening. "You shouldn't be standing out here in this weather. Come inside quickly!"

"Jenkins." Just seeing his kind face made my eyes sting. He'd been more of a parent to me than Elizabeth or Richard ever were. "How's Grandpa?"

"Mr. Taylor has been asking about you all day." He took my bag with practiced efficiency, leading me toward the garden path. "He'll be overjoyed to see you."

I followed Jenkins through the back gardens, grateful for his thoughtfulness in choosing this route. The smell of late roses mixed with the earthy scent of autumn, bringing back memories of childhood afternoons spent hiding among these same hedges with my books.*Before Victoria learned to use my secrets against me. Before Alexander...*

"Has he been taking his medicine?" I asked quickly, pushing away the unwanted thoughts.

"Religiously." Jenkins's voice carried a hint of amusement. "Though he complains about it every morning. Some things never change."

We passed the conservatory where Mother used to host her tea parties,showing off Victoria's latest achievements while pointedly ignoring my existence. Through the glass, I could see staff members arranging elaborate flower displays. *White roses. Victoria's favorite. Of course.*

"The preparations seem... extensive." I kept my voice carefully neutral.

Jenkins's expression remained professional, but something flickered in his eyes. "Indeed. Mrs. Taylor has invited quite a few guests from Wall Street.Something about expanding the family's investment portfolio."

*Using Grandpa's birthday to court investors. How very Elizabeth.* The bitterness must have shown on my face because Jenkins quickly added,"He is in his study. He specifically asked me to bring you to him as soon as I see you."

My heart warmed at that. Even now, Grandpa George was looking out for me,creating a safe space away from the circus downstairs. As we climbed the familiar stairs to the second floor, I could hear voices drifting up from the main hall - Mother's practiced laugh, Victoria's melodic tones, the general buzz of Manhattan's elite doing what they did best: networking and judging.

Jenkins stopped outside the heavy oak door of Grandpa's study,giving me an encouraging smile.

"Summer?" Grandpa George's voice carried through the door,still strong despite his age. "Is that you?"

Taking a deep breath, I knocked softly. "Yes, Grandpa. It's me." "Come in,come in!"The study looked exactly as I remembered - walls lined with books and art.the massive desk dominating one end, comfortable leather chairs arranged near the fireplace. The only difference was the new painting propped against one wall, its protective wrapping only partially removed. Grandpa stood from his desk chair, his face lighting up with genuine joy."Finally! I was beginning to think you'd changed your mind."

"And miss your birthdlay?" I crossed the room quickly, letting him pull me into a tight hug. He smelled the same as always - a mix of old book and that indefinable scent that just meant *home*."Never."

"Let me look at you." He held me at arm's length, his keen eyes taking in every detail. "You've lost weight. Are they working you too hard at Fortune Corp?"

I thought of what my parents had just said in the garden, feeling down.For a moment I forgot to respond.

Grandpa's grip on my shoulders tightened slightly. "You don't have to go down there if you don't want to. We can have our own celebration up here."


"This is your birthday party, Grandpa." I forced a smile, though my heart was racing at the thought of facing them all. "I won't let them drive me away."

His expression softened with understanding and something that might have been pride. "My brave girl." He gestured to one of the leather chairs."Sit with me for a moment. Tell me what's really going on in that brilliant mind of yours."I sank into the familiar comfort of the chair, watching as he settled into his usual spot by the fireplace. For a moment, it felt like nothing had changed -like I was still that little girl coming to him with scraped knees and hurt feelings, knowing he'd make everything better. "Summer." His voice grew serious. "If you still have feelings for Alexander-"

"No!" The word came out sharper than I intended. Taking a breath,I modulated my tone. "No, Grandpa. That's not... A man who could betray me like that isn't worth a second thought."

"Good." He nodded approvingly. "You deserve so much better than a man who can't recognize your worth."

Before I could respond, Jenkins knocked softly. "Sir? Mr. Richard Taylor asks that you and Miss Summer join the party. The guests are asking for you."

Grandpa's expression darkened slightly. "Tell my son-"

"It's okay." I stood, smoothing my dress. "We should go down. This is your party,after all."

The halls of the Taylor mansion seemed longer than I remembered as we made our way downstairs, the sound of the party growing louder with each step. Grandpa's hand found mine, giving it a reassuring squeeze.*At least I'm not facing this alone.*

The ballroom was a sea of designer suits and evening gowns, the air thick with expensive perfume and carefully crafted laughter. As we entered, I felt rather than saw the ripple of attention - the subtle shift in conversations, the quick glances,the barely concealed whispers.

"There you are!" Richard's voice carried across the room, forcefully cheerful."We were starting to worry."

I felt Grandpa's hand tighten on mine as my father approached, Victoria and Alexander trailing in his wake like perfectly trained show dogs. The sight of them together still had the power to make my chest ache, but the pain was different now - more like the phantom sting of an old wound than the raw agony it had once been.
"Summer." Alexander's voice carried that particular note of condescension that I'd somehow never noticed before. "You look... well."

Victoria's smile was picture-perfect as she clung to his arm. "We've missed you,sister dear. Haven't we,darling?"

The endearment hit like a slap. I watched them standing there, so pleased with themselves, so certain of their victory. *They really think they can just rewrite history, don't they? Make me the villain in their little love story.*

"Have you?" My voice came out cool and steady, surprising even myself.How thoughtful of you both to care so much about my wellbeing. Though I can't help but wonder- when exactly did this concern develop? Before or after you decided to announce your engagement while I was overseas?"

Victoria's perfect smile falteredI for just a moment. "Summer, darling, you're not still bitter about that, are you? We only want what's best for everyone."

"What's best?" I couldn't help the bitter laugh that escaped. "Is that what we're calling it now?"

"That's enough." Ríchard's voice cracked like a whip. "This is your grandfather's birthday celebration. I believe you have brought enough shame on this family. Save your dramatics for another time."


###Chapter 24: Unexpected Guest
Summer's POV

"Careful, Richard." Grandpa George's voice carried the kind of authority that could silence a boardroom. "Remember whose house this is. Is this how you speak to my granddaughter? Is this how you treat your own child?"

The tension in the air thickened as Father's face darkened. "Father, you don't understand—"

"Oh, I understand perfectly." Grandpa's grip on my arm tightened protectively. "I understand that you've forgotten what it means to be a father. That you've chosen to sacrifice one daughter's happiness for another's ambition."

Victoria's perfect smile faltered for a moment. "Grandpa, please. We only want what's best for everyone. Summer is just being... difficult."

"Difficult?" The word dropped from Grandpa's lips like ice. "Some things, once tainted, should be discarded. Like trust. Like family loyalty." His eyes fixed on Victoria and Alexander with unmistakable disappointment.

A sudden hush fell over the room. The kind of silence that spreads like a wave, pulling everyone's attention toward the entrance. Brandon Stark stood in the doorway, a distinguished figure in a custom-tailored suit that whispered of old money and absolute power. Everything about him radiated a commanding presence—from the perfect cut of his clothes to the quiet authority in his bearing. James followed two steps behind, carrying an elegantly wrapped box.

What is he doing here? My mind raced. Sure, he was Grandpa’s former student, but this was a private Taylor family event.

The whispers started immediately, rippling through the crowd:

"Brandon Stark?" "The CEO of Stark Group..." "I didn't know the Taylors had that kind of connection."

I watched Victoria's hand tighten on Alexander's arm. "Darling," she whispered, her voice carrying in the hushed room, "you never mentioned this Mr. Stark before."

The way Brandon completely ignored Alexander's presence spoke volumes. Alexander's expression shifted through several emotions before settling into something carefully neutral. "Brandon Stark. He's... family."

"The Brandon Stark?" Victoria's eyes widened. "One of Wall Street's Four Kings?"

I noticed how Alexander's posture changed—he seemed to shrink in Brandon's presence. The realization brought a subtle smile to my lips. Interesting. The mighty Alexander Stark, silenced by a single look.

James approached with smooth efficiency, presenting the package to Grandpa with a respectful bow. "Mr. Taylor, Mr. Brandon Stark sends his warmest birthday wishes."

"Summer," Grandpa's voice carried a hint of amusement, "would you do the honors?"

I helped unwrap the gift. The moment the lid came off, I felt my breath catch. It was the exquisite silver chess set from Christie's, each piece gleaming with quiet dignity.

"My word," Grandpa breathed, his eyes lighting up with genuine delight. "This is from the British Royal Collection, isn't it?"

Old Mr. Stark materialized at our side, his smile a touch too eager. "Brandon! What a pleasant surprise. Alexander, aren't you going to greet your uncle properly?"

I watched Alexander approach Brandon with careful steps. "Uncle Brandon. We... we didn't know you were coming."

Brandon's dark eyes swept over Alexander with casual indifference before finding mine. The intensity of his gaze was steady and supportive. That chess set... he knew exactly how much Grandpa would love it.

"Mr. Stark," Grandpa's voice was warm. "That's too kind of you. You must join us for a game later."

Brandon's lips curved into a rare, enigmatic smile. "It would be my pleasure, Professor."

Victoria, sensing the shift in attention, turned to me with a glint of competition in her eyes. "Summer, darling, what did you get for Grandpa? I do hope it's not something... ordinary."

I stepped forward, retrieving the box from my bag. "Grandpa? Would you like to open your gift now?"

"From my favorite granddaughter? Of course!"

I ignored Victoria’s scoff as Grandpa unwrapped the Christie’s box. His eyes widened as he lifted out the fountain pen.

"Oh, just a pen?" Victoria's voice dripped with false sympathy. "How... practical."

"Actually," James's smooth voice cut through the tension, "I believe I recognize that piece. It’s a rare collector's item from Christie's. Quite a coincidence—Mr. Stark had his eye on it as well."

A ripple of interest swept through the crowd. I caught Brandon watching the scene, his expression unreadable but his support undeniable.

"Christie's?" Mother's voice shifted to a more calculating tone. "Summer, darling, you didn't mention..."

Grandpa was examining the pen with obvious delight. "Summer, this is magnificent. But it must have cost—"

"The price doesn't matter," I said quickly. "I just wanted you to have something you'd truly use and cherish."

The evening eventually became suffocating. I slipped away to the gardens, seeking refuge among the roses. The cool air was a welcome relief. All these years, was this how they really saw me? A burden? A disappointment?

"Alone out here?"

The deep voice made me jump. Brandon stood a few feet away, his tall frame silhouetted against the garden lights. Even in the shadows, his presence was profound.

"Mr. Stark?" I took an instinctive step back, my heels clicking on the stone path. "What are you doing here?"

###Chapter 25: Send Her to Mr. Windsor


*Summer's POV**

He moved closer with that predatory grace that seemed to come so naturally to him. Even in my Louboutins, I had to tilt my head back to meet his eyes. The height difference suddenly felt overwhelming, like he was deliberately using it to make me feel small.
"The garden seems to be your preferred escape." His deep voice was surprisingly gentle, though it still carried that underlying intensity that never failed to make my pulse skip.

I turned away, focusing on a particularly perfect white rose. "Sometimes you just need a moment to breathe."

"The party too overwhelming?" There was something in his tone - not quite concern, but a careful attention that made my chest tighten.

"No. I..." I trailed off, unsure how to explain. The evening air carried the scent of roses. "It's nothing."

"Miss Taylor." The way he said my name made me shiver slightly."Honesty is a virtue,remember?"

"You're very observant, Mr. Stark." I meant it to sound sharp, but my voice came out softer than intended. "Too observant." He moved closer, his presence like a physical force at my back. "Earlier, in the ballroom. Your mother seemed.., concerned about your wellbeing." The careful way he said it - like he was laying out pieces of a puzzle -made something in my chest crack. Mother's words from this morning echoed in my head: *"Summer should be grateful anyone wanted to marry her at all."*
"Concerned?" I couldn't help the bitter laugh that escaped. "Is that what we're calling it now?"
His silence was an invitation to continue, but I hesitated. Why was I even considering telling him? Brandon Stark didn't need to hear about my family drama.

"Summer." The use of my first name made my heart skip. When had he moved so close? "It's okay, you can tell me about it."
Maybe it was the gentle command in his voice, or maybe it was just the weight of carrying these words alone, but something in me cracked. "I overheard them. Right here, actually." I gestured vaguely at the garden path. "Mother and Father, discussing how grateful I should be that anyone wanted to marry me at all. How Victoriawas doing me a favor by taking Alexander." The words spilled out like poison, each one burning my throat."Apparently, I'm too stubborn, too common. Nothing like my perfect sister.


Brandon was silent for a long moment, his expression unreadable in the shadow of the garden lights. When he finally spoke, his voice carried an edge that made me shiver. "Is that what you believe?"

"What?" "That you should be grateful?" His tone made it clear what he thought of that idea. "That you're somehow less than your sister?" "I..." The words stuck in my throat. *Did I believe it? After all these years of being compared to Victoria, of never quite measuring up?* "Your silence answers my question." He stepped closer, close enough that I had to tilt my head back to meet his gaze. "You actually believe them."


"Mr.Stark-"
"Let me be clear." His voice dropped lower, intense enough to make my skin prickle. "Your family's opiníons are... severely misinformed. And Alexander?" A slight smile curved his lips, but it held no warmth. "He's a fool who doesn't deserve a second thought."
Behind us, the sounds of the party drifted through the open doors like a bitter reminder of everything I'd lost - and maybe never really had.
"Want to cry?" His deep voice softened, though that underlying intensity remained.

I forced a smile, though it felt more like a grimace. "What's there to cry about? Do I look that pitiful to you, Mr. Stark?"

His dark eyes studied my face with that unsettling intensity I was starting to know too well. The evening light caught the sharp angles of his features,making him look even more dangerous than usual. "Everyone has their own path to walk, Miss Taylor." His voice dropped lower,sending an involuntary shiver down my spine. "Have you considered my proposal?"

"What?" The word came out breathless. "I... you are Alexander's uncle...they said you were supposed to attend their engagement party..." His hand came up to brush a strand of hair from my face, the touch so gentle it made my heart ache. "In fact, I didn't come for them." Those dark eyes held mine with an intensity that made it hard to breathe. "Take your time. I'll wait for your good news, my girl." The possessive note in his voice when he said 'my girl' made something flutter in my stomach. Before I could respond, a servant appeared with practiced discretion.

"Miss Taylor? Your father is asking for you."




"Summer, come here. Your father has something to say." Father's voice carried that particular tone he used when trying to sound paternal.Elizabeth hovered near the door like a perfectly coiffed vulture.
Father gestured to the chair across from him. "Sit. Your mother prepared this tea-this year's finest Darjeeling. Working in Europe for a year couldn't have been easy. Your sister..."

"Father." I too a sip before I cut him off. "If you want to talk about Victoria, don't bother. You know, Alexander and I were together for so long. Did you ever consider my feelings? If you cared about me even a little, this wouldn't have happened."

"Summer," his voice took on that patronizing tone I'd grown to hate."Your sister didn't mean for this to happen, but feelings..."

"Enough!" The word exploded from me. "Fine tea? Mother never thought to give me the best of anything! When it comes to Victoria, Mother never considers my feelings.You too,father."

"How dare you!" Elizabeth's voice cracked through the air like a whip as she burst back into the room. The slap caught me across the face before I could react. "Don't waste words with her! This ungrateful girl needs discipline-she needs to learn her place!"

I pressed my hand to my stinging cheek, bitter laughter bubbling up in my throat. "Discipline? Like you were discussing in the garden?" "You... you heard that?" Something almost like fear flickered across Elizabeth's perfect features.
"Your mother has arranged someone for you," Father said quickly, not meeting my eyes. "The candidate is..."

The room started spinning slightly. *Something's wrong.* My limbs felt heavy, disconnected. "What... what did you do to me?"
Elizabeth's smile turned predatory. "Summer, your father is negotiating an investment. They've promised to invest $200 million in Capital Corp if you marry into their family. You know your father's company is expanding -this money is crucial."

"So you're selling me?" The words came out slurred. *The tea. Of course it was the tea. Last time it was stranger, and this time it's my own family.Fucking unbelievable.*

Elizabeth's laugh was cold and sharp. "You should be grateful the Windsor family even considered you. At least you're worth something."

The world tilted dangerously as I tried to stand. Through the growing haze. I heard Elizabeth's final command: "Get her to the next room. Don't keep Mr. Windsor waiting!"
###Chapter 26: Windsor's Trap

**Summer's POV**

The familiar patterns of my bedroom ceiling swam in and out of focus above me.

"Finally awake, Miss Taylor?"

The unfamiliar male voice sent ice through my veins. I tried to turn my head toward the sound, but even that small movement made the room spin wildly. Through the haze, I could make out a figure lounging in the armchair by my window - tall, well-dressed, with the kind of casual arrogance that came from old money.

"Who..." My voice came out as a rasp. "Who are you?"

He laughed, the sound sharp and unpleasant. "Playing dumb,or has the drug affected your memory? Charles Windsor, at your service." The mock bow he gave made my skin crawl. "Though I must say, your parents were quite... eager to arrange this meeting."

*Windsor. The investment deal.* Elizabeth's words echoed in my head:*"They've promised to invest $200 million in Capital Corp if you marry into their family."*

"Don't..." I tried to push myself up, but my arms felt like they were made of lead. "Don't touch me." "Or what?" He stood, moving toward the bed with predatory grace. "Your parents are downstairs, probably explaining your sudden illness to the party guests. Your beautiful sister Victoria is keeping everyone entertained.And your ex-fiancé..." He paused, lips curving into a cruel smile. "Well, he seems quite content with his new arrangement, doesn't he?"

The casual way he laid out my isolation made bile rise in my throat.*They planned this. All of them.* "What do you want?" I managed to get the words out despite my tongue feeling too thick in my mouth."Whatever it is, we can discuss it when I'm... when I'm clear-headed."
His laugh held no warmth. "Discuss? Oh, you still think you have a choice in this matter? How... quaint." He reached out, fingers brushing my cheek in a mockery of tenderness. "Your father needs that investment, Miss Taylor. And I... well, I enjoy collecting beautiful things. Especially when they come with such interesting family connections."

I jerked away from his touch, the sudden movement sending the room into a nauseating spin. "Don't... don't touch me!"
"Summer?" Victoria's voice called through the door, sugary-sweet with false concern. "Summer, darling, are you in there? Grandpa's looking for you."

Windsor's smile widened. "Your sister has impeccable timing, doesn't she?Always knows exactly when to check on you."

*She's part of this,* I realized with a fresh wave of horror. *Of course she is.She's always been part of their plans.* "Summer?" Victoría called again, her voice taking on an edge of theatrical worry. "Darling, are you feeling unwell? Should I call someone to help?Just open the door..." The sound of her voice, so perfectly pitched to sound concerned while knowing exactly what was happening in here, made something snap inside me. With strength born of desperation, I pushed myself up and lunged for the crystal vase on my bedside table - a birthday gift from Grandpa George years ago.
Windsor's eyes widened in surprise as I swung the heavy crystal at his head. There was a sickening crack, and he crumpled to the floor like a puppet with cut strings.

"Summer!" Victoria's voice sharpened with real alarm now. "What's going on in there? I'm getting Alexander-"
The room tilted dangerously as I tried to stand. *Have to get out. Have to...* My legs gave out, and I would have hit the floor if strong arms hadn't caught me.
"Brandon?" The word came out as barely a whisper. Those dark eyes I'd know anywhere stared down at me with barely contained fury.
"Here." He shrugged off his suit jacket, wrapping it around my shoulders."Can you walk?"

I shook my head,immediately regretting the movement as nausea swept through me. "They... the tea..."

"I know." His voice carried a dangerous edge I'd never heard before. Footsteps thundered in the hallway- multiple sets,getting closer. Brandon's arms tightened around me as footsteps thundered in the hallway.Without a word, he lifted me and moved swiftly toward the balcony doors.The world spun sickeningly with each step, but his grip was steady and sure. Just as we slipped through the French doors, the bedroom door burst open with a crash. shielding mine from view. Through my drug-hazed mind. I could hear the chaos unfolding in my bedroom.

"What happened here?" Alexander's voice, trying for authoritative but landing somewhere around panicked. "Victoria, get your parents.Now!"

The cool night air helped clear my head slightly, but every muscle in my body feIt like lead.

"Brandon, I whispered. my voice barely a breath. "I feel..."

"Shh." His finger pressed against my lips, the touch sending electricity through my drug-addled system. His other arm tightened around my waist.supporting my weight as my legs threatened to give out.

The voices from the bedroom grew more agitated:

"What do you mean, he was just lying there?" Richard's voice,sharp with barely controlled panic.

"I heard noises," Victoria explained, her voice trembling with perfectly orchestrated distress. "When Summer didn't answer, I got worried and had Alexander break down the door, and we found him like this!"

"Where is she?" Elizabeth's voice carried an edge of hysteria. "That ungrateful girl... I mean, where could she have gone?"

"Search the room,"Richard.commanded. "She has to be here somewhere."

Footsteps moved around the bedroom. I could hear them checking the closet, under the bed, even the bathroom. Each sound seemed to echo in my spinning head.
"Nothing in the bathroom," Alexander reported. "But all her things are still here. She couldn't have gone far."

"Check everywhere!" Elizabeth's voice cracked with barely controlled fury."That ungratefuI child couldn't just disappear!"
Richard finally declared. "She must have run. Elizabeth, calI security.Have them search the grounds. And get someone up here to help Mr. Windsor-quietly!"

We stood frozen as footsteps approached the balcony doors. Brandon's body pressed me further into the shadows, though I couldn't have made a sound if I'd tried. The drug was hitting me harder now, making everything blur at the edges.

"Wait," Alexander called out. "What about the balcony?"

My heart nearly stopped as his shadow fell across the glass doors. But he only glanced outside briefly, not bothering to step through. "Nothing out here either. Just those roses Victoria had planted."

Finally, the bedroom door closed, leaving us in blessed silence. Brandon's hand moved to my forehead, checking my temperature with clinical precision. "You're burning up," he murmured, his voice tight with controlled anger."We need to get you out of here." I tried to focus on hs face, but it kept splitting into doubles. "Can't... can't walk..."

 "I know." His arms tightened around me. steady and sure. "I got you."
###Chapter 27: Mr. Stark, I Feel So Hot

**Summer's POV**

The world was spinning, but Brandon's neck felt wonderfully cool against my burning skin. I pressed closer, seeking relief from the fire coursing through mny veins. My lips brushed against his ear, and I heard his sharp intake of breath.


His hand came up to cup my face, the slight chill of his palm heaven against my feverish skin. Everything burned-my skin, my blood,my core-too hot,too tight, too much. "Mr. Stark," I breathed against his ear,"I feel so hot."


His fingers tangled in my hair, gripping hard, yanking my head back just enough to expose my throat. I whimpered, wrapping my arms around his neck, my nails digging into his shoulders as I pressed my aching pussy against his thigh, desperate for friction. Like a ship crashing into harbor, I clung to himn, my body trembling as I rubbed myself shamelessly against his solid frame, soaking through my panties with every needy grind.

Footsteps echoed down the hallway, growing closer. Brandon tensed, but I barely registered the danger through the haze of whatever they'd put in that tea.


"How could she just vanish?" Richard's voice carried clearly through the door. "We brought her in ourselves!" "Keep looking!" Elizabeth's sharp command cracked through the air."After what she did to the Windsor heir, how are we supposed to secure that investment? This is your fault- I told you to guard the door until everything was settled. Now she's gone!" Brandon's arm tightened around my waist, "Hold on to me," he commanded softly.  The world tilted as he shifted me in his arms. The cool night air against my face helped clear my head slightly. Just enough to realize...

"Brandon?" My fingers clutched at his shirt as I processed our position."What are you..."

"Hold on." His voice brooked no argument as he shifted me in his arms,balancing on the balcony's edge. Below us, the garden stretched out like a dark maze, illuminated only by scattered security lights. "And whatever happens,don't scream."

*He's insane,* I thought distantly. *We're going to die.*

"Close your eyes."

The world tilted sharply as he moved. Cool night air hit mny face,and I felt the strange sensation of falling. But Brandon's arms remained steady around me, his grip secure as wwe somehow ended up in the garden below.

I clung to him like a koala, face pressed into his shoulder as he navigated through the shadows. His expensive suit would probably be ruined, but I couldn't bring myself to care. Eveything hurt except where I touched him.

"Sir?" James's efficient voice cut through my haze. "WNhat happened to Miss Taylor?"

"Hamptons estate," Brandon's command brooked no argument. "Now."

The world shifted again as he settled me into the car's leather seat. He draped his suit jacket over me, but it was suffocating against my burning skin. I squirmed, shoving it off, my hands fumbling to hike my skirt higher,desperate to cool the throbbing heat between my thighs. My fingers brushed my soaked panties, and I rubbed myself shamelessly, moaning as I spread my legs wider,

"Stop that," Brandon's voice carried a note I'dI never heard before as he caught my wandering hands.

"You're mean," I pouted, my words slurring as I arched my hips,trying to grind my dripping pussy against his thigh again.

"How am I mean?" His deep rumble vibrated through his chest, pressed tight against my aching tits.

"You just are!" I whined, struggling to focus on his face-two gorgeous versions of him swimming in my vision. "I'm hot,I feel awful,and you won't help!"

"Summer," his voice dropped, a husky growl that sent a fresh gush of wetness between my legs, "you're not thinking clearly."

The car jerked, and I was flung against his chest, my nipples scraping against his shirt through my thin top. My head bumped the window,tears stinging my eyes as he lowered it, cool air rushing in-useless against the fire in my core. My hand slid down, brushing something hard and thick straining against his pants. "What's this?" I giggled, palming his cock through the fabric, feelingit twitch under my touch. "Why is it-"

"Don't move." His grip on my wrist tightened, firm but gentle, as he throbbed beneath my fingers.

"You're being mean again!" I whined, stroking him harder, reveling in the way his jaw clenched.

"Be good and stay still."

"But you haven't told me what that was! Why was it-"

"Behave." The word was a whip of authority, and I pouted, sulking as he spoke into his phone: "Twenty minutes to Hamptons!"

James raised the privacy partition, and Brandon's cologne enveloped me- woodsy, masculine, intoxicating. I nuzzled closer, ignoring his efforts to keep space between us, and pressed my open mouth to his neck, sucking hard, leaving wet, red marks. My tongue traced his pulse, and I ground my pussy against his thigh, soaking his pants with my dripping arousal.

"Summer." His voice was rough, strained, as I caught his earlobe between my teeth, biting down, delighting in his sharp inhale. His hands clamped on my waist, fingers digging in, and I couldn't tell if he was pushing me away or pulling me tighter as I rocked against him, my clit pulsing with every grind.

"You smell so good," I murmured, my lips trailing sloppy, wet kisses along his jaw, finding the corner of his mouth. I licked there,tasting him,my hands sliding under his shirt to claw at his chest, nails raking over his nipples.

For one electrifying moment, he gave in, his lips crashing against mine,tongue thrusting deep into my mouth, fucking it with slow, deliberate strokes. I moaned into him, my pussy clenching as I rubbed myself harder against his thigh, chasing release. Then he pulled back, his dark eyes blazing, his cock visibly straining against his pants, a damp spot forming where I'd teased him.


"Not like this," he rasped, his voice raw with restraint. His thumb traced my lower lip, and I sucked it into my mouth, swirling my tongue around it,imagining it was his cock. The touch sent a jolt straight to my core, my hips bucking against him. "When you kiss me,I want you fully aware of what you're doing."




The Hamptons estate loomed out of the darkness like a dream. As the car stopped, I glimpsed Dr. Sean leaning against the entrance,a cigarette dangling from his fingers, his eyes narrowing with curiosity as he watched us. Brandon lifted me from the car effortlessly, my legs wrapping around his waist, my soaked pussy pressed tight against his abs as he strode past Dr.Sean without a word. The motion sent the world spinning,and I whimpered, burying my face in his shirt, my lips sucking at his collarbone.

"Well, well." Dr. Sean's voice dripped with amusement as he crushed out his cigarette. "Who's this? Brandon Stark bringing a woman to his private sanctuary? I never thought I'd see the day."

Brandon's only response was a curt "Get inside" as he carried me through the mansion's elegant halls.

"Seriously, Brandon," Dr. Sean continued, following with that effortless grace. "Who is she? You drag me out in the middle of the night-don't tell me you're having... performance issues?"

I felt Brandon's muscles tense beneath me. "Another word," his voice was pure ice, "and I'll make you regret it."

"Alright, alright!" Dr. Sean's tone stayed light, but it sharpened. "She's been drugged? Who would dare touch someone under your protection?"

Brandon laid me carefully on the softest bed I'd ever felt, his hands lingering on my hips, his fury palpable. "Just check her condition. Now."
###Chapter 28: I'm Cold, Stay With Me

**Brandon's POV**

Sean pushed off from where he'd been leaning against the wall, cigarette dangling between his fingers. His usual playful smirk faded as he took in Summer's condition.


"The drug's strong," he noted, professional demeanor replacing his typical casualness. "Whoever did this knew what they were doing." His eyes flickered to my face. "You know, if she's under your protection,why not just take her to a hospital?"

I ignored his probing tone, laying Summer carefully on the sofa. Her fingers clutched at my shirt, reluctant to let go. "You recognize her?"

"Don't worry - just saw her once at some charity gala." He crushed out his cigarette, moving closer to examine her. "Though I am curious how you got mixed up with the Taylor family. Isn't your distant relative Alexander somehow connected to them too?"

"Something like that." I kept my voice neutral, though the mention of Alexander made my jaw clench.

Sean's hands were gentle as he checked Summer's vital signs. "So what's the plan here?"


"You're the doctor." I couldn't quite keep the edge from my voice."Why are you asking me?"

He glanced up at me, that familiar mischievous glint returning to his eyes."Come on, man. Beautiful girl like this, and you're acting so cold? That's not like you at all." His grin widened. "Though I just finished surgery, and we don't have any antidote here. The most direct solution is right in front of us..," The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees as I met his gaze.
"Don't tell me..." His eyebrows shot up. "You haven't sealed the deal yet?"

"Are you going to help her or not?"

"Hey, you're the one asking for favors here..." He held up his hands at my expression. "Fine, fine. James, we need ice-lots of it. Physical cooling is our only option right now. Though I should warn you, she'll probably spike a fever afterward. I'll write you a prescription, but you're in for a long night."
Summer stirred restlessly on the sofa, her skin flushed with fever. "Hot..."she mumbled, trying to push away the light blanket James had draped over her. "Everything's burning..."
I moved her to the master bathroom while James gathered supplies. The massive tub filled quickly, steam rising as hot water mixed with the ice James kept bringing in. Summer fought weakly as I lowered her into the water, her fingers digging into my arms.

"You're cruel" She looked up at me with tear-filled eyes, bottom lip trembling. "It's too cold, you bad man!"

"Stay still." I kept my voice gentle despite the rage still simmering beneath the surface."Just a little longer."

She pouted, pressing closer despite the way I tried to maintain some distance. "I'm cold.,. stay with me."

I comforted Summer briefly and went out after she felt better,finding Sean sprawled in my favorite armchair.

"How is she?" he asked, studying me with unusual intensity. 
"Still here?"

"You know, what you're doing isn't exactly fair."

"Fair?" I could feel my patience wearing thin. "I don't need to discuss this with you."
"Hey, I just helped you out big time! And aren't you worried about potential complications tonight? I am a doctor-having me stay would be beneficial."

"Not necessary.James,show him out."

After they left. I stood on the balcony, watching the moon cast silver shadows across the manicured lawn.Self-control had always been my strong suit. But now... I glanced back at Summer's sleeping form. Perhaps she would be the exception.

In the car earlier, I'd nearly given in to desire. Only the thought of her potential panic and regret upon waking had stopped me.
She shifted in her sleep, letting out a soft sigh. My fingers hovered over her cheek, pulling back just before making contact.

"Mr. Stark." James's voice pulled me from my thoughts. "Here's the surveillance footage from the Taylor mansion tonight."

"Double your bonus this month."

"Dr. Sean was fishing for information, but I didn't reveal anything.Though knowing him..."

"Let him be."

James hesitated before continuing. "Sir, about Charles Windsor-he does have an oral agreement with Richard Taylor about the investment, but it's just talk so far. Charles doesn't have much influence in the Windsor family. 
George Windsor makes all the decisions, and he might not even know about this."

"I heard Charles Windsor was interested in Victoria," James added carefully.

I couldn't help but laugh. "You think Victoria was his target? No, James."

"What should we do now,sir?"

"Watch and wait. This isn't your concern. Look into Capital Corp's recent activities instead."

"About Fortune Corp's investment reduction you ordered?"

"They haven't noticed yet?"

"No,sir."

"Reduce it another 10%. And that new project bid in the South District-speed it up."

I worked through the rest of the night, finishing up various tasks until the early hours. *The Taylors will regret this,* I thought, reviewing the surveillance footage again. *Especially Elizabeth and Richard.*

After putting away the last of the documents, I lit a cigarette and stood on the balcony, staring into the pitch-black night. The familiar taste of nicotine did little to calm the rage still simmering beneath my surface.I waited until the cigarette burned down to nothing before releasing it, my dark eyes unusually bright in the darkness.

Standing at Summer's bedside, Llooked down at her sleeping form. The fever-induced flush had finally faded from her face, leaving behind delicate features that caught the moonlight. I'd known from the first moment that Summer was beautiful, but I hadn't realized just how striking she was without makeup.*God,she's stunning.*

A slight smile touched my lips as I adjusted her blanket. She sprawled across the bed in a way that completely contradicted her usually composed daytime demeanor. *Always trying to maintain control, aren't you,Summer?* The heat must have bothered her - she'd kicked off the covers at some point, exposing one smooth shoulder to the night air.

My gaze darkened as I felt my breathing accelerate. Looking down at my own body's reaction, I realized I was hard again. Since meeting this woman,I seemed to be... losing my self-control. *What are you doing to me.Summer Taylor?* The desire to touch her, to claim her, was becoming harder to resist with each passing moment.

A phone buzzed by the window, the sound sharp in the quiet night.

Walking over, I picked up Summer's phone. Several missed calls lit up the screen-some from George Taylor and Professor Thompson, but also Alexander's number among them. *Alexander.* The name alone made my jaw clench.

I smiled, switching the phone to silent and watching it continue to flash uselessly in the darkness.
###Chapter 29: Does That Proposal Still Stand
Summer's POV

Even through the lingering haze of the previous night, I could feel a steady, grounding presence nearby. When consciousness finally returned, the first thing I noticed was the unfamiliar ceiling—all clean lines and modern elegance, a stark contrast to the cozy simplicity of my own apartment.

My head felt heavy, and my muscles ached as if I’d been through a physical marathon. Fragments of the night before rushed back: Grandpa’s birthday party, the bitter taste of the tea, the unsettling smiles of the Windsors, and Brandon... Brandon lifting me out of that nightmare.

The room was a masterclass in masculine luxury—muted grey and white tones with impeccably crafted furniture. Sunlight streamed through floor-to-ceiling windows. I looked down, realizing I was wearing an oversized white dress shirt. It was crisp and cool against my skin, carrying the subtle, refreshing scent of cedarwood that I now associated with Brandon.

"Ms. Taylor?"

The deep voice startled me. I sat up quickly, pulling the duvet higher around my shoulders. Brandon stood in the doorway, looking perfectly composed in dark loungewear. His dark eyes studied me with an intensity that made my pulse quicken, though his expression remained professionally calm.

"Mr. Stark!" I tried to steady my voice, but it came out a little breathless. "Where... where am I?"

"You’re at my estate," he said, stepping into the room. "There’s medication on the side table. Dr. Sean was here earlier to monitor your recovery. How are you feeling?"

"I... I think I'm okay." I glanced at the pills arranged with precision on the table. "You saved me last night. Thank you."

"It was the only logical course of action," he replied matter-of-factly.

I hesitated, looking down at the shirt. "About... the change of clothes..."

"The medical staff ensured you were comfortable and treated for the fever," he said, his tone neutral, immediately easing the spike of panic in my chest. "Your dress was ruined; it’s being handled by a specialist service."

I clutched the sheets, the weight of the previous night’s betrayals settling back onto my shoulders. My mother’s calculation, my father’s silence... they had been willing to trade my future for an investment. The memory sent a chill through me that no amount of sunlight could warm.

"Hungry?" Brandon’s voice pulled me back from the edge of those dark thoughts.

I nodded slowly. "Yes. A little."

"The ensuite has everything you need. Freshen up and join me downstairs for breakfast."

The bathroom was a sanctuary of marble and high-end fixtures. Everything was laid out with care—new toiletries, plush towels, and a selection of products that felt like a quiet indulgence. After washing away the last traces of the night’s trauma, I made my way down the sweeping staircase.

Brandon was waiting at the bottom, his focus shifting to me as I descended. "I hope the guest suite was to your liking?"

"It’s more than I expected, Mr. Stark. You’ve gone to a lot of trouble."

"It was necessary," he said, leading me toward a sun-drenched dining room. "I live here alone, so the house is usually quiet. I thought you’d appreciate the privacy while you recovered."

The breakfast spread was surprisingly thoughtful—fresh fruit, light pastries, and protein to help me regain my strength.

"Dr. Sean mentioned the fever might break early this morning," Brandon said as he pulled out a chair for me. "I kept the meal light to help with your recovery."

"Thank you." The simple domesticity of the scene felt surreal. Here I was, sitting across from one of the most powerful men in the city, while my own family was likely already calculating the fallout of my disappearance.

He’s the only one who can actually help me, I realized. He’s outside my parents’ reach, respected by my grandfather, and clearly has no fear of the Windsors. The proposal he’d made at the Manhattan Club—the one I’d dismissed as a move in a power game—suddenly looked very different. It looked like a shield.

"Mr. Stark?" My voice was quiet but clear.

He looked up from his coffee, his eyebrow arching slightly. "Yes, Summer?"

"That day at the Manhattan Club... you made a suggestion. A proposal." I paused, meeting his gaze. "Does that offer still stand?"

The silence stretched between us, heavy with the weight of a life-changing decision. Brandon didn’t answer immediately; instead, he studied me with that unsettling, brilliant intensity. A small, dangerous smile touched his lips—not of triumph, but of profound interest.

"I don't make offers I’m not prepared to honor," he said, his voice a low velvet rumble. "The question is, are you ready to accept what comes with it?"

I took a breath, feeling the ice of the past few days finally begin to melt. "I think I am."


###Chapter 30: You'll Have Everything You Want
**Summer's POV**

Time seemed to freeze in that moment. My heart was racing wildly, the sensation completely beyond my control. *What have I done?* Instant regret washed over me for being so impulsive - I should never have blurted out something like that.

My face burned as I kept my head down, unable to look at Brandon. I felt utterly mortified. *What kind of woman just asks about marriage proposals like that? So much for playing it cool.*


The morning sunlight streamed through Brandon's floor-to-ceiling windows, making the elegant breakfast spread before me look almost surreal. I stared down at my plate, unable to meet his intense gaze. *God. What was I thinking? Can I take back what I just said?*

"That..." My voice came out embarrassingly squeaky. "I was just asking! Please don't take it seriously!" Brandon's fingers drummed a gentle rhythm against the pristine tablecloth. "Miss Taylor," his deep voice carried just a hint of amusement, "do I seem like someone who makes jokes?" "What? I mean..." The words died in my throat as I finally looked up, meeting those dark eyes that never failed to make my pulse race. "Wall Street knows one thing about Brandon Stark-I always mean what I say." His tone was calm but carried an undercurrent of steel that made my skin prickle. "I gave you time to think it over. Now that you've made up your mind,I won't let you take it back."

"Mr. Stark, I just wanted to-"

"You don't need to explain." He cut me off smoothly,his expression unreadable. "Whatever changed your mind isn't important. What matters is the result." His dark eyes held mine with an intensity that mnade it hard to breathe. "Miss Taylor, I promised you - marry me,and you'll have everything you want. Name your terms."

The casual way he said it - like we were discussing a business deal instead of marriage-should have bothered me. But after last night, after seeing how easily my own family had tried to sell me off... *At least Brandon's being honest about his intentions.*


"Mr. Stark?" I twisted my napkin nervously. "Can I ask you something?"

One perfect eyebrow arched slightly. "Why me?" The question that had been burning in my mind since that first proposal finally spilled out. "There must be dozens of women who'd jump at the chance to marry you."He studied me for a long moment, his expression thoughtful."Is Miss Taylor very concerned about the answer?" I nodded, unable to look away from his intense gaze.

"Sometimes," his voice softened slightly, "the right person appearing at the right time is reason enough."

The weight of his words hung between us like a physical presence. *The right person at the right time.* It sounded almost romantic, except this was Brandon Stark-Wall Street's most infamous CEO. Nothing about him wasthat simple.

"If we get married," I said carefully, "I'll take it seriously.I don't like complications, and I've never considered divorce as an option."

"Good." His approval sent an unexpected warmth through my chest. "Unless you choose to end it, this marriage will be permanent."

I couldn't help but laugh, though it came out slightly bitter."You should know - I have no power in the Taylor family. No shares in Capital Corp,no-"

"Only weak men care what their wives bring to a marriage."The steel was back in his voice.

"But in Manhattan, many people-"

"Is that what you're worried about?" His dark eyes pinned me in place. "Your complicated family situation? Or perhaps how your parents tried to trade you to the Windsors for a two hundred million dollar investment?" Heat flooded my face at the reminder of last night's humiliation.
"I just... you should know what you're getting into."

"These problems will resolve themselves after the marriage."The casual confidence in his tone made something flutter in my stomach. "Unless Miss Taylor doesn't trust me?"

Before I could respond, he asked, "When would you like to get married?"


"As soon as possible." The words tumbled out before I could stop them. "I don't want my parents to have a chance to interfere."

"Today."

I nearly choked on my tea. "Today? But..."

"All the arrangements are in place." He turned to James, who materialized beside us with his usual silent efficiency.′′IsJack Peterson still at the City Clerk's Office?"

"Yes, sir. He's awaiting your instructions."

"Have him come over. Bring all necessary documents." I watched in stunned silence as James made the calls.Everything moved with military precision, like a perfectly choreographed dance where I was the only one who didn't know the steps. Within an hour, a distinguished-looking man arrived with a briefcase full of papers. "Mr. Stark, it's been too long." Brandon nodded slightly. "Everything prepared?"

"Of course. Given the special circumstances, we can waive the standard waiting period."

"Is this even legal?" I couldn't help asking.

Peterson smiled kindly. "Don't worry, Miss Taylor. We allow exemptions in certain cases."

The weight of what we'd just decided to do hit me like a physical blow. This wasn't how I'd imagined my marriage-no white dress, no flowers, no family gathering to celebrate.The last time I'd planned a wedding, it had been with Alexander,full of romantic dreams and naive hopes.

But maybe this was better. No pretense, no false promises of eternal love. Just two adults making a choice, eyes wide open.

The next hour passed in a blur of signatures and legal jargon.Brandon's private attorney appeared to witness everything,his presence lending an air of absolute legitimacy to what felt increasingly like a dream.

I stared down at the marriage certificate in my hands, my signature still drying beside Brandon's bold strokes. "Just like that? We're married?"
###Chapter 31: Don't Answer His Call

*Summer's POV**


"Yes." Brandon's deep voice carried that familiar note of absolute certainty.
*God, how can he be so calm about this?*

"Well, it's getting late. I should probably go..." I started to stand, but Brandon's raised eyebrow stopped me mid-motion.

"Summer." The way he said my name made my pulse skip. "It's still morning."

Heat flooded my face as I realized he was right. The bright morning sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows made that perfectly clear. *Great job, Summer. Really nailing this whole 'sophisticated new wife thing.*

"Oh... right." I sank back into my chair,suddenly hyperaware of what I was wearing - or rather, what I wasn't wearing. Brandon's white dress shirt barely reached mid-thigh, and I'd just sat through the registration progress dressed like this. In front of James. And Peterson.*Oh god.*

"Why didn't you say something?" I demanded, mortification making my voice crack slightly. "Those marriage registration photos... I look..." "Beautiful." The way he said it - like it was simply a fact-made my heart do complicated gymnastics in my chest. "Mr.Stark-" "Brandon." He corrected smoothly, "We are married now,after all." *Married.* The word still felt surreal. Less than twenty-four hours ago, I'd been getting ready for Grandpa's birthday party, and now.. "Your dress is still being cleaned." His voice pulled me from my spiral of thoughts. "You should head upstairs. Your phone is in the master bedroom."

The mention of my phone sent a jolt of anxiety through me. *How many missed calls do I have by now?* "Right. I should... check my messages.And maybe... find some proper clothes?"

His dark eyes swept over me in a way that made my skin prickle with awareness. "Upstais. First door on the right."

Brandon's master bedroom felt different in the morninglight-less intimidating somehow, though no less luxurious. My phone sat on the bedside table, its screen lit up with notifications. *Twenty-seven missed calls.* Most were from Alexander and my parents, but seeing Grandpa Jonathan and Grandpa George's names made my heart twist with guilt.
Taking a deep breath, I called Grandpa Jonathan first. He picked up on the first ring.

"Summer, darling?" His worried voice made tears prick at my eyes."Where have you been?"

I hesitated, memories of last night's events flashing through my mind.Grandpa Jonathan had never hidden his dislike for the Taylor family-a coldness that extended even to his own daughter, my mother.For as long as I could remember, there had been this inexplicable tension between them, though I never knew why. "Grandpa, I'm so sorry! My phone died last night..," The lie tasted bitter,but I couldn't tell him about Windsor. About how my own parents had tried to... After a moment's consideration, I decided to keep last night's events to myself. Grandpa Jonathan already harbored such negative feelings toward the Taylor family- if he learned what they'd tried to do to me,he'd storm over toconfront them immediately. I couldn't bear the thought of him getting into a heated argument with them, especially over me. Besides.Grandpa George had always been different from the rest of them, always showing me genuine kindness and care.

"Are you alright? When you disappeared from the party..."

"I'm fine, Grandpa." I forced cheer into my voice. "I just wasn't feeling well after wishing Grandpa George happy birthday. Please don't worry."

His sigh carried years of understanding. "You know you can tell me anything,right?"

"I know, Grandpa." *Just not this. Not yet.*

After reassuring him a few more times, I called Grandpa George. His voice was gruff with concern: "I may be old, but I'm not blind. Something happened last night."

"I'm fine, Grandpa," I assured him quickly. "I just... needed some time alone after the party. Please don't worry about me."

"You should have come to me." The hurt in his voice made my chest ache.
"Whatever it was, you didn't have to face it alone."

"I know." My voice cracked slightly. "I just... I didn't want to ruin your birthday.""Silly girl." His tone softened. "Listen, maybe it's better if you stay away from the house for a while. Ifyou want to see me, we can meet outside.Jenkins can drive me." "I'd like that." The tears I'd been holding back finally spilled over. A discrete knock at the door made me jump. Brandon stood there with a Chanel shopping bag, his expression unreadable as always. "Your dress is still at the cleaners. This will have to do for now."

Inside the bag was a stunning cream-colored dress that probably cost more than my monthly rent. "How did you... this is exactly my size."

That dangerous half-smile played at his lips. "Of course it is."

*Of course it is.* The casual confidence in his tone made something warm flutter in my stomach. "I'll go change."

The dress fit perfectly - *because of course it did* - highlighting curves I hadn't even known I had. I placed a hand over my racing heart, only to catch sight of Brandon emerging from the walk-in closet. The sight made me freeze, my breath catching in my throat.

I'd always known he had an excellent physique - perfect proportions that made him look like he was born to wear bespoke suits. But this...this was something else entirely.

He wore a light-colored suit that had clearly been tailored specifically for him, the cut emphasizing his athletic build without a hnt of excess anywhere. The tailoring wasn't entirely traditional - there were subtle modern touches that set it apart. His shirt underneath was clearly expensive, the top three buttons left casually undone to reveal a tantalizing glimpse of his tanned skin. The effect was less formal than his usual attire,carrying a hint of deliberate casualness that somehow made him even more attractive. A simple silver pin served as his cufflink, the understated elegance perfectly matching his style. *How does he manage to look this good in everything?* I couldn't tear my eyes away - there was something magnetic about his presence that demanded attention. He adjusted his cufflink with one hand, the gesture effortlessly elegant.Catching my bright-eyed stare, the corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile I knew so well, his perfect eyebrow arching slightly."See something you like?"

I quickly looked away, offering a small smile but no verbal response.∗Cod,he knows exactly how good he looks.*

My phone buzzed again, and my stomach dropped when I saw the caller
ID. Brandon must have noticed my expression because he smoothly plucked the phone from my hand.

"If you don't want to answer," his deep voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse race, "then don't."
###Chapter 32: My Marriage Ends Only in Deat Not Divorce
**Summer's POV**

I couldn't help letting out a small sigh as I watched Brandon take my phone. He stood in the center of his expansive living room, one perfect eyebrow arched as he studied my expression. "Having second thoughts?"

"No!" I shifted uncomfortably on the Italian leather sofa, painfully aware of how defensive I sounded. The morning sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows made everything feel surreal, like I was stuck in some strange dream where I'd somehow ended up married to Brandon Stark.

"Hmm." The sound carried volumes of meaning I wasn't readyto unpack.

"Look." I said quickly, "whether you believe it or not, what happened with Alexander is over." The words came out steadier than I felt. "You don't need to worry. Since I chose to marry you, I won't do anything inappropriate."
Something flickered across his face - surprise, maybe? - before his lips curved into that dangerous half-smile I was starting to know too well."Good. I'll take you home."
"Okay." I tried to match his casuial tone, though my heart was racing. He moved toward the foyer with that predatory grace that seemed to come so naturally to him. "I know this has all happened very quickly," his deep voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my skin prickle, "but we are married now. I hope you understand what that means.11 I followed him, chewing my lower lip as Itried to formulate a response." Give me some time," I managed finally. "I mean, you don't need to remind me. Since I agreed to marry you, T'll definitely respect our marriage-"

"Summer." The way he said my name made me stumble slightly.He turned to face me, his dark eyes holding mine with that unsettling intensity. "You don't need to be so tense. I'm just talking to you, not some kind of monster."

*You're scarier than any monster,* I thought, but I forced a smile. "Right."




The ride to my apartment felt endless. Brandon's presence beside me in the car was like a physical force, drawing my attention no matter how hard I tried to focus on the passing scenery.

"You had a rough night," his deep voice broke the silence. "Get some rest when you get home. Don't catch a cold."

Heat flooded my face despite nothing having actually happened last night.
I stared down at my hands, twisting my fingers nervously. "You..."

"I'll give you three days," he said, eyes fixed on the road ahead. "Then I'll come get you."

I turned to him, startled. "What? What three days?"

"You didn't think we'd live separately after marriage, did you?" The way he emphasized 'separately' made something flutter in my stomach. Embarrassment washed over me as I realized I hadn't thought that far ahead at all. My hands clasped together in my lap, palms suddenly sweaty."L.. I'm sorry, I'm not ready." The reality of my situation hit me like a physical blow. I knew almost nothing about this man I'd just married. His likes, his dislikes, his family background. his social circle - it was all a mystery. "Mr. Stark"I pressed a hand to my forehead."can I take it back?"

"We just got married right?" panic made my voice shake slightly. "Maybe it's not too late. No one knows about this yet, we could-

Miss Taylor." His fingers tapped a gentle thythm against the steeting wheel. "My matriage ends only in death, not divorce." His tone remained casual,almost playful, but something in it made my skin prickle."And didn't you just say we just got married? Yet you're already talking about divorce?"

I let out a nervous laugh, words failing me. My hand moved to the doot handle on instinct, only to find it locked. "Brandon Stark," I couldn't keep the frustration from my voice,"you can't force people like this!"

His brow furrowred slightly, "Force?" The temperature in the car seemed to drop several degrees. "Have you forgotten something? Marrying me was your idea."

My heart thundered against my ribs as his eyes fixed on me with predatory focus."But... but I..."

Something in my expression must have given away my panic because his gaze softened slightly. "Did I scare you?" He reached over to brush a strand of hair from my face. "I was just teasing." The casual intimacy of the gesture made my breath eatch. He leaned closer to undo my seatbelt, and suddenly the space between us feltcharged with electricity. "I didn't mean to frighten you," his voice carriedI that velvet-soft quality that never failed to make my pulse race. "I just hope you understand -what's done is done. Why run from it?" His dark eyes held mine, "Instead of avoiding it, why not accept it? You might find a different perspective." I took a deep breath, trying to steady my racing heart. "Fine. I'll try to adjust. Three days - you promised me three days."

Something that looked dangerously like approval flickered in his eyes."Of course. I always keep my word." His lips curved into that half-smile that made my stomach do complicated flips. "Though I hope after three days,you won't still be this...skittish."




I practically ran into my apartment, locking the door behind me before sliding down against it. My legs felt like jelly, and myface burned as I tried to catch my breath. *What have I done? What have I done?*

"This is bad," I muttered to myself, pressing my hands against my flushed cheeks. "This is really, really bad."

Everything had happened so fast. I'd always prided myself on being careful, on thinking things through. But in less than twenty-four hours, I'd gone from discovering my parents' betrayal to marrying Brandon Stark. *Summer Taylor, what were you thinking?*

I dragged myself to the bathroom, needing to see my reflection -to make sure I was still me. The woman in the mirror looked startled, cheeks flushed and eyes too bright. *Was I just scared? Scared of what my parents tried to do?* There had to have been other options besides marrying Brandon. Had I just traded one form of control for another?

Cold water helped clear my head slightly, but my hands still trembled as I patted my face dry. The strange thing was, I felt surprisingly calm about Alexander's betrayal. Maybe it was the shock of my parents trying to sell me to the Windsors, or maybe Alexander's true nature had been apparent for longer than I'd wanted to admit. Either way, my heart felt oddly steady when I thought about him now. A knock at the door made me freeze. Thmrough the peephole. I saw Alexander standing there, looking as perfectly put-together as always. My stomach twisted with disgust. *After what happened last night, he actually has the nerve to show up here?*
###Chapter 33: At Least He Won't Sell Me out for Two Hundred Million
**Summer's POV**

*Knock. Knock. Knock.*

"Summer, open the door. We need to talk."

"Summer, I know you're home. I saw you come back." Another series of knocks, more insistent this time. "Everyone's worried about last night.Where did you go? Why didn't you answer anyone's calls? Do you know how worried Victoria was?"


A bitter laugh came out from my mouth. "Worried? What's there to be worried about? Disappointed that Charles Windsor didn't get what he wanted?" *The audacity of them - to act concerned after what they tried to do.*

Through the peephole, I watched his perfect facade crack slightly. The memory of last night made bile rise in my throat- not just Elizabeth and Richard's betrayal, but Alexander's role in it all. *If Brandon hadn't shown up when he did...* The thought sent ice through my veins. *My own family. They were willing to sacrifice me for money.* "God." I pressed a hand to my mouth, fighting back a wave of nausea.That was Grandpa George's birthday party. If anyone had seen me with Charles Windsor... my life would have been over. *They didn't just try to sell me-they tried to destroy me completely,* "Summer, let me explain." Alexander's voice took on that reasonable tone he used when trying to manipulate me. "I really didn't know what happened last night. Victoria said you disappeared, your room was locked,we were worried..." "Bullshit! Alexander." My voice came out steady despite the way my heart hammered against my ribs. "I'm not a child anymore. I can tell right from wrong. You were there last night-we both knew it. No need to put on an act." *The way he stands there, still thinking he can control the narrative.Still thinking I'll believe whatever story he spins.*

"Trading me for Windsor's two hundred million dollar investment? Keep dreaming!" The words tasted like poison. "Just go away. I don't want to see you."

"Summer!" His composure cracked further, real emotion bleeding through. "What happened to you? You're like a hedgehog, all spikes! We're all trying to help you!"

The laugh that burst from my throat sounded almost hysterical. "Help me?Haven't you done enough damage?" *Three years of my life wasted on this man. Three years believing in a love that never existed.*

"Alexander, please leave. Just hearing your voice makes me sick!" *And it does - physically sick, like my body is rejecting every memory of him.*

There was a moment of tense silence. Then: "Do you have another man?"

My heart skipped a beat. *Brandon.*

"I saw you get out of a Bentley." Alexander's voice had taken on an edge I'd never heard before. "Were you with him last night? Where did you go?" "Enough!" The word exploded fromme like a bullet. "Who I'm with is none of your business." *The jealousy in his voice - after everything he's done, he still thinks he has some claim  on me?* "How is it not my business? I'm your-" "My what?" I cut him off, anger giving me strength. "Or did you forget?You're Victoria's fiancé now," *The words don't even hurt anymore. Maybe that's the strangest part - where there used to be pain, there's just...nothing.*

"There's nothing left to discuss between us. I remember everything from last night, and I'm not someone you can manipulate so easily. Go tell my sister she better watch her step - if I get the evidence of her pulling anything like this again, I'll make sure she regrets what she did to me!"

My mind drifted to childhood memories-all those times my parents favored Victoria,all those quiet afternoons with Grandpa George. *"Chess teaches you to think clearly,"* he'd always say. *"To see what you really want."* The memory brought unexpected tears tomy eyes. *He always knew, didn't he? That someday I'd have to learn to stand up for myself.*

"T've always seen you as a younger sister," Alexander was saying, his voice softening in that way that used to make my heart flutter. "That year you were in Europe, we spent more time together, and things just..."

"So you decided to get engaged while I was away?" The bitterness in my voice surprised even me. "The whole of Manhattan knows you're engaged to Victoria. And what about me? In everyone's eyes, I'm the homewrecker who tried to steal my sister's fiancé?"

"Do you even know who that man is?" Alexander demanded.

Something warm bloomed in my chest as I thought of Brandon's quiet strength, his unwavering protection. "I know he's better than you-better than all of you. At least he won't betray me. At least he won't sell me out for two hundred million dollars!" "Better? You barely know him! How long have you even known this man?"
"Enough, Alexander. If you don't leave, I'm calling the police." I was done with this endless cycle of confrontation. Nothing good could come from dragging this out any longer. But Alexander had always been stubborn,
incapable of letting things go.

He kept calling my name through the door, his voice carrying down the hallway. I caught fragments of neighbors' conversations as they passed,their whispers adding to my mortification.

*What's the point of allthis?* I let him continue his tirade, refusing to engage. The silent treatment had never worked with Alexander before, but I had nothing left to say to him.

His voice took on an edge of desperation. "Summer, open the fucking door!Do you think running away solves anything?"

"Excuse me, sir. Are you a resident here?"

The unexpected question cut through Alexander's rant. Two police officers had appeared in the hallway, their expressions professionally neutral as they sized him up.

"We received a complaint about a disturbance," one of them continued."Sir,if you're not a resident, we'll need you to come with us."

I listened to their footsteps fade away, Alexander's protests growing fainter until finally, blessed silence fell. The tension drained from my shoulders as I leaned against the door,exhausted.

My phone sudden rang. An unknown number flashed on the screen. After a moment's hesitation, I answered. "Hello?"

"It's me." His deep voice sent an unexpected wave of calm through me.


"Brandon?"

"Mm.Is he gone?"

"Did you..." I glanced at the security guard through the peephole. "Did you call the police? Are you still nearby?"
###Chapter 34: Between Husband and Wife, No Thanks Needed
**Summer's POV**

"I saw him following my car when I left," Brandon's deep voice carried that casual confidence I was starting to know well. "Given his... persistence,
I thought it best to alert the police before he could cause any trouble."

Running to my balcony, I scanned the street below for any sign of that familiar Bentley. "I don't see your car!"

Brandon's soft laugh rumbled through the phone,sending an unexpected warmth through my chest. "I'm already back at the office."

"Do you have connections at the police department?" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. "I've never seen them respond so quickly to a complaint."

"You seem very curious." That dangerous amusement was back in his voice. "Let's just say I prefer to be... prepared. Especially when it comes to protecting what's mine."

The possessive note in his voice made my pulse skip. *What's mine. When did I start thinking of that as comforting instead of threatening?*

"Oh." The word came out smaller than I intended. Something about knowing he'd arranged protection without needing to be there himself made my heart do complicated things. *He didn't need to show off or take credit- he just... helped.*

"Thank you," I said softly, meaning it more than I had in a long time.

"Between husband and wife," his voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse skip, "there's no need for thanks." *Husband and wife.* The words hit differently now, making heat creep up my neck. This morning's marriage registration felt like a dream, but his casual use of our new status made it suddenly, startlingly real.

"Now that he's gone," Brandon continued, "get some rest. And pack your things- I'll come get you in three days."

After he hung up, I sank onto my couch, mind spinning. The events of the past twenty-four hours felt surreal -from Grandpa's birthday party to my parents' betrayal to... marriage. To Brandon Stark, of all people.

*But he's different, isn't he?* The thought came unbidden. Besides my grandfathers, he was the first person to protect me without expecting anything in return. Even when I'd rejected his initial proposal,he'd respected my decision while still looking out for me.




The next three days felt like walking through a storm. My phone buzzed constantly with messages from my parents while headlines about the Windsor drama filled my social media feeds. The Wall Street Journal's headline made my stomach drop: "Windsor Family Threatens to Withdraw $200M Investment from Capital Corp After Heir's Mysterious Injury."

*God, they're really milking this story.* I scrolled through the article,catching phrases like "incident at Taylor family gathering" and "sources close to the family suggest potential lawsuit." According to the gossip columns, Richard Taylor had been seen practically camping outside Mount Sinai Hospital, desperately trying to smooth things over with the Windsors.

My phone lit up with yet another call from Father. After twenty-seven missed calls, I finally answered, more out of exhaustion than anything else.

"Summer!" His voice carried that particular blend of anger and desperation I'd grown up fearing. "Do you have any idea what you've done? The whole Windsor family is out for blood!"

"What I've done?" The words came out sharp with disbelief. "You mean defending myself after you and Mother tried to..." My voice cracked. "After you drugged me and left me with that monster?"

"Charles Windsor is from an excellent family. This marriage would have saved Capital Corp! Instead,you've ruined everything with your stubborn-"The dismissal in his tone made something snap inside me.

"Saved Capital Corp?" I couldn't hold back a bitter laugh. "By selling your daughter? Is that really your solution?"

His voice rose dangerously, "Everything I've done has been for this family's future! The Windsors are threatening to pull their investment-do you know what that means? Capital Corp will be finished on Wall Street!"

"And somehow that's my fault? Not yours for trying to..." I had to take a deep breath before continuing. "What kind of father drugs his own daughter and leaves her with a stranger?"

"I did what had to be done!" The raw fury in his voice made me flinch despite myself. "If you had just played along, everything would be fine!But no, you had to make a scene, had to embarrass us in front of everyone-"

"Make a scene?" The words exploded from me. "You tried to sell me! Your own daughter! And now you're angry because your plan failed?"

His voice turned cold. "Summer, listen carefully. You will go to the hospital. You will apologize to Charles Windsor. You will do whatever it takes to fix this mess you've created. If you play your cards right, maybe he'll still consider-"

"Still consider what?" My hands were shaking so hard I could barely hod 
the phone. "Marrying me? After what you and Mother did?"

"This isn't about what you want!" He shouted. "This is about family loyalty! About duty! About-"

"Enough! Just shut the fuck up!"

I ended the call and immediately blocked his number, my hands shaking as fresh tears spilled down my cheeks.

My hands shook slightly as I sorted through my belongings, deciding what to take to Brandon's. The process felt strangely therapeutic- like shedding an old skin, leaving behind the naive girl who'd trusted her family unconditionally.

Just then, my phone rang again. The number looked vaguely familiar, but after that draining conversation with Father, I was too emotionally exhausted to think straight. *If this is another relative trying to guilt-trip me...*

"Who is this?" I answered sharply.
###Chapter 35: We're Already Married

**Brandon's POV**

"You haven't saved my number?" I kept my voice carefully neutral,though something dark and possessive twisted in my chest at the realization.Through the phone, I could hear Summer's breath catch.

"I'm sorry..." Her voice came out small, uncertain. "I forgot."

"Explain." The word carried more weight than I intended, but the thought of her not even having my contact information sparked something dangerous in me. *My wife shouldn't have to search for my number.*

"It's just... so much has happened lately..." She trailed off, and I could picture her nervous fidgeting perfectly.

"I'm downstairs." I watched the entrance to her building through the Bentley's tinted windows, remembering how she'd looked this morning in my shirt. The memory made something warm coil in my stomach. *Soon she'll be permanently in my home,where she belongs.*

"What? Already?" The surprise in her voice almost made me smile. Almost."I need to pack some things-"


"Stay where you are." I cut her off smoothly, already moving toward the building's entrance. "Wait for me." The elevator ride felt endless, though I knew it couldn't have been more than thirty seconds. My fingers tapped a restless rhythm against my thigh as I watched the floor numbers climb. When the doors finally opened,I found Summer already waiting in her doorway,wearing a simple sundress that somehow managed to look more appealing than any designer gown.*She has no idea how beautiful she is, does she?* Her eyes widened slightly as she took in my appearance. "You really came up yourself..."

"Obviously." I moved past her into the apartment, scanning the space with new eyes. The place was smaller than my walk-in closet, but there was something undeniably... Summer about it. Books arranged by color on floating shelves, a small collection of throw pillows arranged just so on a modestly sized sofa, everything neat but lived-in. *This is where she's been living, while her family plotted against her.*

"I haven't finished packing," she said quickly, gesturing to several half-filled suitcases scattered around the living room. "I didn't expect you so soon."


Without waiting for her to continue, I moved to the nearest suitcase and began efficiently organizing its contents. The sight of her personal belongings-delicate blouses,well-worn books,carefully folded sweaters-stirred something possessive in my chest. *All of this will be in our home soon.*


Summer's surprise was evident. "You don't have to..."

Before I could respond, familiar footsteps sounded in the hallway."Seriously, Brandon?" Sean's voice carried clear annoyance as he appeared in the doorway. "You dragged me away from surgery for this? Edward couldn't help?"

I continued folding one of Summer's cashmere sweaters,enjoying how the soft material felt against my fingers. "Professional movers aren't reliable enough." *And I don't want strangers handling my wife's belongings. "Oh?" His eyes sparkled with barely suppressed mischief as he took in the scene. "So you thought a surgeon would be better? Though Brandon Stark doing manual labor- that's a sight I never thought I'd see."I shot him a warning look while carefully placing the sweater in the suitcase. "Make yourself useful or leave."

Sean's grin widened as he picked up a box of books. "The mighty CEO of Stark Group, packing a lady's clothes. If Wall Street could see you now..."

"Shut up and work," I growled,though there was no real heat in it.*L them see. Let everyone see that Summer is different.*

Summer shifted nervously, clearly uncertain how to handle our interaction.
"There's...quite a lot of stuff..."

"That's not a problem." I moved to examine another open suitcase,methodically reorganizing its contents for maximum efficiency. The task was oddly satisfying - each item carefully placed, each space perfectly utilized. *Like pieces on a chessboard, everything falling into its proper place.*

"But if I'm moving out, shouldn't I give notice to-"

"Keep it." The words came out more commanding than I intended, but the thought of her having no retreat, no space of her own, didn't sit right."The Hamptons estate has everything you need,but you might want to come back occasionally."

Sean chose that moment to set down another box, his eyes dancing with barely contained amusement. "Well, well! Ms. Taylor, I'm Sean Sullivan,this tyrant's best friend and occasional accomplice." I felt rather than saw Summer's tension at the title. "Hello, Dr. Sullivan. I'm Summer... Taylor." The slight pause before her surname made something possessive stir in my chest. "It's going to be Summer Stark, am I right?" Sean's eyebrows shot up as he glanced between us. "Focus on the boxes." I cut him off before he could say anything else, lifting a particularly heavy trunk myself. The physical exertion felt good-a tangible way to contribute to this transition in our lives. *When was the last time I did something like this with my own hands?*

Summer, ever the perfect hostess, tried to salvage the awkward moment."Would you like something to drink?"

"I'd love a-" Sean started.

"He doesn't need anything." I interrupted smoothly, carefully stacking another box. "Keep packing."

The next hour passed in a blur of efficient movement. Between the three of us, the apartment slowly emptied, each box and suitcase a step closer to our new reality. I found myself oddly invested in the process, taking particular care with anything that seemed personal or fragile.

"Thank you for helping, Dr. Sullivan," Summer said once the last box was loaded, watching as I secured it in place.

"Please, call me Sean." He flashed her that trademark charming smile that had half of Manhattan's society women swooning. "Though I have to ask -are you sure about moving to The Hamptons? That's quite a-"

"Problem?" I asked quietly, letting just enough danger seep into my tone.

"Not at all!" Sean held up his hands in mock surrender. "Though Brandon.your reaction is a bit obvious, don't you think?" Summer glanced at her watch. "Why don't you both sit down for a bit? I'll just make a few simple dishes - it won't take long."Neither Sean nor I refused, and she took our silence as agreement, heading straight for the kitchen.

 I watched her move efficiently around her small kitchen,the sight of her cooking in that sundress doing complicated things to my chest. The domesticity of the moment felt dangerously appealing.

Once she was fully occupied with preparation, I turned to Sean. "You can leave now."


"You can leave now." I directed the words at Sean, who was already opening his mouth to accept. My shirt was slightly damp with sweat from the moving, but I felt oddly satisfied.This kind of physical work was far from my usual routine, but doing it for Summer felt right.


"Hey, this is still Summer's apartment, and she offered lunch!" Sean's eyes danced with mischief. "You're not her husband yet, what right do you have to kick me out?"

"About that..." I couldn't help the dangerous smile that curved my lips as I watched understanding dawn on Sean's face."We're already married."
###Chapter 36: I Need Mrs. Stark, Not Just Summer Taylor
**Brandon's POV**

"You can't be serious." Sean's voice dropped to a whisper as he watched Summer busy herself in the kitchen, his usual playful demeanor replaced by genuine shock.


I allowed myself a dangerous smile, enjoying his reaction. "Have you ever known me to joke about such things?"


"Brandon..." His eyes narrowed as he studied my expression. "Have you lost your mind? She's nothing like-"


The temperature in the room dropped several degrees as I fixed him with a cold stare, cutting off whatever he'd been about to say. Sean might be one of my closest friends, but some topics were off limits. He knew that better than anyone.

"Whatever you're planning," he continued in a lower voice, "Summer's innocent in all this. If she knew the truth about-"

"I know exactly what I'm doing." My tone brooked no argument. "This doesn't require your interference. Summer is my wife now. It's that simple."

Sean ran a hand through his hair, a gesture I recognized from our college days- his tell when he was genuinely worried. "Simple? Will the Stark family accept her? You know better than anyone how deep Wall Street's waters run."


"Is that why you're opposed?" I-couldn't help the slight amusement that crept into my voice. Sean had always been the most straightforward of our group,wearing his concerns on his sleeve.


He wisely changed the subject, though his eyes remained troubled. "Just... be careful. Not everyone adapts well to our world."

"Like how you chose to be a surgeon instead of taking over family business?" I kept my tone light, but we both knew the weight behind those words. The Sullivans were one of New York's most powerful family. But Sean had never cared about any of that.

I still remembered the uproar his decision had caused. The entire Sullivan family had opposed his choice to become a surgeon rather than takeover the family business. Even now, years later, the tension remained palpable at any Sullivan family gathering. But Sean had always been stubbornly independent, following his own path regardless of others'opinions. He'd chosen surgery despite unanimous family opposition, and looking at him now, it was clear he had no regrets.

"My decisions, like yours, don't require others' approval." I continued

Sean shrugged, some of his usual humor returning. "Come on, I became a surgeon specifically to avoid all this financial district drama."

The sound of plates clinking in the kitchen drew both our attention.Summer moved with unconscious grace as she prepared dinner,completely unaware of our conversation. Something in my chest tightened at the sight of her in my space, so naturally domestic it almost hurt.

"Dinner's ready," she called, her voice carrying that hint of uncertainty that made me want to both protect and possess her. "Brandon," Sean's grin turned mischievous as we moved toward the dining room, "who would have thought Mrs. Stark would be such a domestic goddess?" "Just eat." But I couldn't quite hide my satisfaction at his use of her new title. Summer set down a perfectly arranged plate in front of me, her cheeks flushing slightly as our fingers brushed. "I'm sorry if it's not up to restaurant standards..."

"Much better than hospital cafeteria food,"Sean assured her with that easy charm that had half of Manhattan's society women swooning."You know,there aren't many Manhattan socialites who still cook these days."

"Please have more if you like it." The shy pride in her voice made something possessive stir in my chest.

I watched her take small, careful bites, hyperaware of every movement.When a strand of hair fell across her face, I couldn't resist reaching out to brush it back, enjoying how she froze at my touch.

"The food will get cold," she mumbled, trying to hide her reaction.

Sean's eyes danced with barely suppressed amusement. "Mrs.Stark,you should know - Brandon isn't nearly this gentle normally."


"Sean." I let just enough warning seep into my voice. "Didn't you just finish surgery?"


"Not tired at all!" He backtracked quickly. "Summer's cooking is really excellent."


After dinner, as we moved to the living room, Sean brought up the inevitable: "Now that you're married, when are we getting together with the others?" I glanced at Summer, noting how she tensed at the mention of social obligations. "When she's ready." "Anytime works for me-us surgeons have way more flexible schedules than you finance types. It'd be great to get Edward and everyone together." Summer's eyes widened slightly. "The Wall Street Four Kings... that's the group people always talked about?"

"You've heard of us?" I couldn't help the pleased note that crept into my voice.

"At Columbia," she admitted, not meeting my eyes. "Students used to talk about you all the time."

"So you were interested in me even back then?" I couldn't resist teasing her,enjoying how her cheeks flushed darker.

"Mr. Stark, please don't joke!" She twisted her fingers nervously. "I didn't even know you then. It was just campus gossip."

Once Sean had finally left, I turned to find Summer still looking adorably flustered. "It's getting late. Let's go home, Mrs. Stark."

"Could you... not call me that?" The way she ducked her head made something warm unfurl in my chest.

"Why not?" I kept my voice gentle but firm. "We're legally married now.You need to get used to your new identity."

She bit her lower lip, a gesture that never failed to capture my attention."Do you know why I'm not introducing you to anyone else yet?"

"Why?" Her voice came out small, uncertain. "Because I need Mrs. Stark, not just Summer Taylor." I watched the words land, noting how her eyes widened slightly. "Until you fully accept that identity, I won't introduce you to anyone. Do you understand?" "I... I'm sorry." She wouldn't meet my eyes. "I'll give you time to adjust." Looking at her now - still shy, still uncertain,but trying so hard-I felt that dangerous possessiveness rise again. *Well,*I thought, watching her fidget under my gaze.*She'll understand exactly what it means to be Mrs. Stark.*
###Chapter 37: You Can't Go Back on Your Wor d
**Summer's POV**

The Hamptons estate materialized out of the gathering dusk like something from a dream. As Brandon's Bentley glided through wrought iron gates that probably cost more than my entire apartment, my stomach did a complicated flip. *What have I gotten myself into?*

"All of this..." I gestured vaguely at the sprawling grounds, the manicured gardens, the elegant fountains. "This is yours?"

Brandon's lips curved into that dangerous half-smile I was starting to know too well. "Most of this area." His casual tone made something flutter in my chest. *Most of this area. Right. Because owning just one massive estate would be too modest.*

James stood waiting at the entrance, his professional mask firmly in place despite the late hour. As Brandon guided the car into what had to be the world's most impressive garage, I couldn't help the small gasp that escaped.The space looked more like a luxury car showroom than a private garage-gleaming floors, perfect lighting, and more exotic cars than I'd ever seen in one place.

"These are all..." I trailed off, not quite sure how to finish that sentence without sounding completely overwhelmed.

"You have a driver's license?" Brandon's deep voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse skip. "Got it at Columbia." *Back when life made sense and I wasn't suddenly married to one of Wall Street's most powerful men.*His dark eyes studied me with that unsettling intensity. "That Porsche- won it from Dr. Sean last year in a bet. Barely drive it. You can use it."

"What? No!" The words came out too quickly, too sharp. "I mean, I can just use Uber."

"A car is basic necessity here." The way he saidit-like gifting six-figure vehicles was perfectly normal- made my head spin. "You'll need it for work. The area's quite isolated."

"It's too expensive..." Even as I said it, I knew how ridliculous it sounded.To Brandon Stark, a Porsche probably was like a basic necessity.

"As my wife, this is the minimum standard." The casual possessiveness in his voice sent an unexpected shiver down my spine.

The house itself-if you could call something this massive a house- took my breath away. Modern minimalist design somehow managed to be both imposingly elegant and subtly welcoming. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered stunning views of the ocean, and every piece of furniture looked like it belonged in a museum.

"Besides James, there's no permanent staff," Brandon explained as he led me through rooms that could have comfortably housed my entire apartment building. "Professional cleaning service comes three times a week. Private chef on call whenever needed."


"I can cook!" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. "I mean. I'm not great,but..."

His dark eyes held mine for a moment longer than necessary."That would be...interesting."


We reached what had to be the security hub, and Brandon's fingers flew over a sleek control panel. "Put your hand here," he instructed."Need to set up your biometrics." I placed my palm against the cool surface,watching in fascination as green light traced my fingerprints. "Thisis like something out of a spy movie."

"Fingerprints, iris scan, facial recognition." He guided me through each step with surprising patience. "The code is my birthday."

"Oh..." Heat crept up my neck as I realized I had no idea when that was."When is..."


"You don't know?" Something flickered across his face-disappointment?

"You never mentioned it," I said quickly, hating how defensive I sounded.

"June 5th."

"Wait, that's..." I stared at him in shock. "That's my birthday. How did you... are we born on the same day?"

"You seem quite unconcerned about your husband." His tone carried just a hint of reproach that made my stomach twist with guilt.

"I..."

Something about his expression made me reach for my bag, where I'd carefully stored our marriage certificate. My hands trembled slightly as I unfolded the document, scanning until I found the information. There it was, in black and white: June 5th, 1992."Oh my god." The words came out as barely a whisper. "We really do have the same birthday." "Oh my god." The words came out as barely a whisper. "We really do have the same birthday."

 *Same birthday. What are the odds?* Something warm and complicated unfurled in my chest at this discovery. It felt like the universe was playing some elaborate joke-or maybe trying to tell me something.

My mind was still reeling from this revelation as we reached the master bedroom. The space was stunning -a 180-degree ocean view,custom furniture that probably cost more than my yearly salary, and a walk-in closet bigger than my entire apartment.

Brandon carried my suitcases in himself, moving with that predatory grace that seemed to come so naturally to him. I watched in stunned silence as he began efficiently arranging my things in the massive closet, which had clearly been prepared for my arrival. Half the space was already organized with empty hangers and drawer space, waiting to be filled.

"Actually..." My voice came out smaller than intended. "Maybe my things could go in one of the guest rooms?"

He continued hanging my clothes as if I hadn't spoken.

"I mean..." I twisted my fingers nervously. "We're still getting to know each other."

"Summer." His deep voice brooked no argument. "We're married. As your husband,I see no reason for separate rooms."

"But we barely know each other!" The words burst out before I could stop them. "You said you'd give me time." "I did." He turned to face me, those dark eyes pinning me in place. "Time to adjust to our relationship. Not to create more distance between us." "This is all happening so fast." My voice cracked slightly. "I need time." "Too fast?" One perfect eyebrow arched. "I find it rather slow." "Hmm?"Brandon moved toward me with that predatory grace, backing me up until I stumbled against the wall. I found myself caught between the cool surface at my back and his overwhelming presence,my hands pressed flat against the wall as I tilted my head back to meet his gaze.He was close enough that I could feel the heat radiating from his body.barely inches separating us.

He braced one hand against the wall beside my head, effectively caging me in. The position forced me to look up at him, making me acutely aware of our height difference and how completely he dominated my personal space.*When did the room get so warm?*

I unconsciously licked my dry lips, watching his dark eyes track the movement. "You..."

"Brandon, you can't do this!" Frustration finally overcame my nervousness."You can't go back on your word!"

"I promised you time to adjust." His tone left no room for argument."I never mentioned separate rooms."

I stared at him, torn between admiration for his logical trap and frustration at being outmaneuvered. *He's right - technically,he never promised separate rooms.* But something in his expression made me wonder if he'd planned this all along.
###Chapter 38: The First Night

*Summer's POV*

"If I really wanted to do something to you," Brandon's deep voice had carried that dangerous edge that never failed to make my pulse race,"would I need to wait until now?"

I'd frozen as hhe withdrew his hand, my voice coming out small: "I'm sorry..11


"No needto apologize." His dark eyes had held mine with unsettling intensity. "We're married now. I'll treat you as my wife, and you need to remember-I'm your husband."

He'd continued after a moment, his tone carrying a weight that made my skin prickle: "If I really wanted to take advantage of you,those two times you were drugged would have been perfect opportunities. But I don't prey on the vulnerable."

My heart had clenched painfully at the reminder."I..."

"T'll give you time to adjust," he'd said finally, "but not indefinitely. You take the master bedroom. I'll use the guest room."

Despite the luxurious comfort of the custom king-size bed, sleep eluded me completely. Every time I closed my eyes, memories of the day flooded back.

*Our shared space.* The thought alone made my heart race. Everything felt surreal, like I'd stumbled into someone else's life by mistake.

After an hour of tossing and turning, I finally gave up on sleep. The house felt different at night - all sleek shadows and quiet elegance. As I padded down the hallway in my simple pajamas, I couldn't help feeling like an imposter in this world of casual luxury. A warm glow spilled from Brandon's study, the door left slightly ajar.I hesitated.torn between curiosity and caution. *Should I knock? Just walk away? What's theprotocol when you're married to someone you barely know?*

Before I could decide, his deep voice carried through the gap: "Come in."

Heat flooded my face as I pushed the door open. Brandon sat on an Italian leather sofa, surrounded by stacks of documents. He'd loosened his tie and rolled up his sleeves, somehow managing to look even more devastating than usual. The sight of those forearms shouldn't have affected me so much, but something about the casual intimacy of the moment made my pulse skip.

"I didn't mean to disturb you," I said quickly, suddenly very aware of my bare feet and simple sleepwear. "I just couldn't sleep and saw the light..."

His dark eyes studied me with that unsettling intensity I was starting to know too well. "Trouble sleeping in a new place?"

"Something like that." I shifted nervously, unable to meet his gaze. The study was incredible - floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lined with everything from investment treatises to rare art books. My fingers itched to explore them. "Your collection is even more impressive than Grandpa Jonathan's."

"Looking for something specific?" The amusement in his voice made me realize I'd been staring at the books like a kid in a candy store. "No, I just..." I grabbed the nearest volume, needing something to do with my hands. "I saw you weren't in the guest room, so..." "Work doesn't stop for personal matters." He set aside some papers,giving me his full attention. "Today's impromp tu move threw off my schedule." The guilt must have shown on my face because his expression softened slightly. "Come here." My feet carried me forward before my brain could object. Up close, I could see the subtle signs of fatigue around his eyes, though his posture remained perfect as always.

"It's just..." The words stuck in my throat as I watched him loosen his tie further. "About our marriage... could we keep it quiet for now? At least from my grandfathers?"

One perfect eyebrow arched."Why?"

"You know how Grandpa Thompson is." I twisted my fingers nervously. "I just ended things with Alexander, and even though he likes you. I explicitly told him nothing would happen between us..."

"And now we're married." That dangerous half-smile played at his lips."Worried about his reaction?"


"He'll think I was lying to him!" The words burst out before I could stop them. "And Grandpa George... after everything that happened at his birthday party..."

"Summer." The way he said my name made my skin prickle. "They'll find out eventually. Hiding it will only make things more complicated."

"I know. I just need time to figure out how to tell them." I sank onto the sofa beside him, careful to maintain some distance. "Everything's happening so fast." He studied me for a long moment, his expression unreadable. "You're overthinking things." "Easy for you to say! You're..." I gestured vaguely at him,encompassing everything from his perfect posture to the casual authority he  radiated."You. And I'm just..." "My wife," He cut me off smoothly, those two words carrying enough weight to make my breath catch. "That's all that matters."




Sunlight was streaming through the windows and the smell of coffee filled the air,waking me up.

The smell of breakfast drew me downstairs like a siren song.I found Brandon in the kitchen, looking unfairly attractive in casual clothes as he moved with easy confidence between professional-grade appliances. The sight of him cooking was so unexpected it stopped me in my tracks.

"Sleep well?" He didn't turn around, but I could hear the smile in his voice.

"You cook?"

"Basic skills." He plated what looked like a perfect omelet. "Freshly squeezed orange juice in the fridge."

I retrieved place settings, hyperaware of his presence as we moved around each other in the massive kitchen. Everything felt strangely domestic, like we'd been doing this for years instead of hours.

"I can cook next time," I offered, watching him add a sprig of herbs with chef-like precision. "You shouldn't have to..."


"I'm used to it." He set a plate in front of me, the presentation worthy of a five-star restaurant. "Eat. You'll need energy for work." The mention of work sent a jolt of anxiety through me. Reality crashed back in - I still had to face Fortune Corp, deal with Alexander and Victoria,navigate this new life I'd chosen. As if reading my thoughts, Brandon pulled something from his pocket.The keys sparkled in the morning light as he set them beside my plate."For the Porsche. You'll need it for the commute."
"But what about you?"

That dangerous half-smile played at his lips. "Worried about me already?"

Heat flooded my face. "That's not what I meant!"

"The car's yours." His tone brooked no argument. "I have other options."

The drive to Fortune Corp felt surreal, like I was playing dress-up in someone else's life. The Porsche handled like a dream, responding to the slightest touch. *This is really happening,* I thought, watching the speedometer climb. *I'm married to Brandon Stark, driving his car,sleeping in his bed...*

The familiar sight of Fortune Corp's parking garage helped ground me.But as I pulled into a spot, a shadow fell across my window. My heart nearly stopped as I recognized that silhouette.

"Summer." Alexander's voice carried that particular blend of concern and condescension that used to make my heart flutter. Now it just made my skin crawl. "We need to talk."

Before I could respond, his hand shot out, grabbing my wrist as I tried to step away from the car. "Let go!" The words came out sharp with genuine anger.
###Chapter 39: How Did I Ever Love Him?

*Summer's POV**

"Nice car." Alexander's eyes fixed on the Porsche,something ugly flickering across his features. "Who bought it for you?"

I kept walking, refusing to engage. But his next words stopped me cold.

"This quickly, Summer? I didn't think you'd find another Stark so fast."

The insinuation in his tone made my blood boil. "Move, Alexander.Some of us actually have work to do."

He stepped closer, eyes fixed on the Porsche's keys in my hand. "Custom edition. Must have cost a fortune." His laugh held no humor. "Though I guess that doesn't matter when you're sleeping with-"

"Don't." The word came out sharp as a blade. "You lost any right to comment on my life when you chose Victoria."

His hand shot out, grabbing my wrist with bruising force. "Lost the right?After three years together, you thinkyou can just-"

"Let. Go." Each word carried ice as I tried to pull away. "We're in the company parking lot. Is this really how you want people to see you?""Let them see." His grip tightened painfully. "Everyone already knows our history. That day at your apartment, how could you call the police? You wouldn't even listen-" "Because there's nothing left to say!" I finally managed to wrench free, my heart pounding against my ribs. "You're engaged to my sister. End of story," He followed as I strode toward the elevator, his longer legs easily keeping pace, "It's not that simple and you know it. Victoria,the engagement-it's 
just business.Her shares in Capital Corp-"

"Stop following me." My voice carried more steel than I feltas I jabbed the elevator button repeatedly. Come on, come on.*


The moment the doors opened, I darted inside, praying they'd close before he could follow. No such luck. Alexander slipped in just before they shut,effectively trapping me in the small space.

"Summer." His voice softened to that particular tone that used to make my heart flutter. "Just listen to me. Please."


I pressed myself against the far wall, maintaining as much distance as possible. "There's nothing to discuss."

"Victoria means nothing." He moved closer,crowding me into the corner."The engagement, her fifteen percent of Capital Corp - it's all just strategy.Once I secure my position in the company..."

"You're disgusting." The words burst out before I could stop them. "Do you even hear yourself? You want both sisters? Is that it?"

His eyes darkened dangerously. "You know you're the only one I really want. Victoria's shares are just a stepping stone. Once everything's settled-"


The elevator dinged open onto the executive floor, and I practically bolted out. But Alexander caught up in the empty hallway, spinning me around to face him. "Summer,wait-" "Don't touch me!" But his arms came around me from behind, pulling me against his chest in a twisted parody of intimacy. "Just wait for me," he breathed against my ear, the familiar scent of his cologne making my stomach turn. "Once I have control of Capital Corp,we can-


The crack of my palm against his cheek echoed in the quiet hallway.We both froze, stunned by the sudden violence of it. My hand stung from the impact, but the shocked look on his face was worth every second of pain.

"Today never happened." My voice came out steady despite my racing heart. "Try this again, and I won't be so nice. We're done,Alexander.Forever."


I didn't wait for his response, just turned and walked away on legs that threatened to give out. My whole body trembled with the aftermath of adrenaline as I practically ran to the executive washroom.

The elegant space was mercifully empty as I leaned over the marble sink,trying to scrub away the feeling of Alexander's touch. The water was probably too hot, but I welcomed the sting. Anything to erase the memory of his hands on me.


*How did I ever love him?* The thought came unbidden as I stared at my reflection. The woman in the mirror looked different somehow - stronger maybe, or just more aware. I'd told myself over and over that Alexander meant nothing to me now, but the memories still had the power to hurt.He'd been my dream once, back when we weren't even together. He was a few years older than me, and I'd always see him after classes. Back then, I didn't even understand what it meant to like someone. Just seeing him was enough to make me happy. Then one day he happened to help me out of a tight spot, and we became friends. Everything was beautiful then, before Victoria inserted herself between us.Even when my family pushed me away, he gave me warmth. Alexander was the first person who ever celebrated my birthday with me. My eyes stung as memories flashed through my mind like shooting stars.I remembered everything from back then, but the man in those memories was long gone. Time, it seemed1. had been the greatest destroyer of what we'd had.


The sound of voices in the hallway pulled me from my spiral of memories.

"Did you see Taylor's new car?" The words carried clearly through the door. "That Porsche must have cost a fortune."

"In Manhattan, a Porsche isn't that special." A second voice chimed in.dripping with false moderation.

"This isn't just any Porsche- it's a custom edition. Word is it belongs to someone from Stark Group."

"Really? You think Summer Taylor found another Stark that quickly?"

"Careful," a third voice warned. "The walls have ears at Fortune Corp."

Their footsteps faded away, but their words lingered like poison in the air.*Let them talk.* I thought, straightening my spine as I checked my
makeup one last time. *They don't know anything.*

The walk to my office felt longer than usual, every pair of eyes following my progress down the hallway. The whispers weren't even trying to be subtle anymore. "Good morning, Director Taylor!" The chorus of greetings carried varying degrees of sincerity as I passed the analyst pool. I managed a professional smile, keeping my head high. "Good morning,everyone."My office felt like a sanctuary as I closed the door behind me,finally allowing my shoulders to drop. The view of Manhattan stretched out beyond my windows, reminding me of mornings in Brandon's kitchen.*Brandon.* Just thinking his name brought a complicated mix of emotions.

"Amy?" I pressed the intercom button, needing to focus on work before I got lost in thoughts of my new... husband. *God, that word still feels surreal.* "Could you come in for a minute?"


Amy appeared with her usual efficiency, tablet ready. "Yes, Miss Taylor?"
###Chapter 40: Is He Doing This Because of Me?
 **Suimmer's POV**

"Come in, Amy." I gestured to the chair across from my desk. "It's been a year since last time you worked for me. I'm hoping you can come back to my side as my assistant."

She perched on the edge of the seat, professional mask firmly in place despite the tension radiating from her. "I... I wasn't sure if you'd still want me as your assistant."

"Why wouldn't I?" I kept my voice gentle, remembering all the late nights we'd spent preparing presentations, all the times she'd covered for me when I needed a moment to breathe. "You've always been my most reliable support."

Her eyes flickered to mine before quickly looking away. "Since you returned from Europe,you haven't come to me. I thought you don't want me as your assistant anymore..."

"And I apologize for not communicating with you sooner."

Something in Amy's posture relaxed slightly. "No, Miss Taylor, you don't need to apologize. I've heard... things. But I've worked with you and Mr.Alexander Stark before. I know the rumors can't be true." My heart warmed at her loyalty, even as a familiar ache bloomed in my chest at the mention of Alexander. *Focus on work,* I told myself firmly."Well,since you're staying with me, let's concentrate on the tasks at hand." I pulled out the European division's files, spreading them across my desk."I need your help reviewing all this data, especially the projects involving Stark Group." Amy's professional demeanor snapped back into place as she accepted the documents. "Of course. What should I focus on?"

"Cash flow patterns and project termination rates." I tapped a particular spreadsheet meaningfully. "Some of these numbers don't quite add up."




The boardroom felt like a shark tank as I took my usual seat, careful to keep my expression neutral despite the tension crackling through the air.Old Mr. Stark sat at the head of the table,his usual commanding presence somewhat diminished by the dark circles under his eyes. *Trouble sleeping?Good.*

Lawrence's smug smile as he arranged his papers made my skin crawl.But it was Alexander's late entrance that really caught my attention - his normally impeccable appearance slightly disheveled, tie askew as he slid into his seat.

"Alexander." Old Mr. Stark's voice cracked like a whip. "This is the third time you've been late."

"Sorry, Father." Alexander straightened his tie with fingers that trembled slightly. "There were some issues with the Windsor family..."

"Sit down." The dismissal in Old Mr. Stark's tone would have been funny if I hadn't been so focused on maintaining my professional mask."Lawrence,continue your report."I let Lawrence's droning voice wash over me as I reviewed my own notes one last time. The pattern we'd uncovered was impossible to ignore -systematic withdrawal of Stark Group investments, strategic termination of key projects, a slow but steady erosion of Fortune Corp's foundation. "And that concludes the quarterly performance review." Lawrence's voice carried that particular note of self-satisfaction that always made me want to throw something at him. "As you can see, despite some minor setbacks...

1

"Actually." I couldn't quite keep the steel from my voice as I stood. "I noticed some concerning trends in the data."

The projector hummed to life as I brought up the first chart. "Over the past three months, Stark Group has been systematically reducing their investment position. Here-" I highlighted a particularly dramatic drop,"you can see the pattern accelerating."

"These numbers are misleading!" Lawrence's face had taken on an interesting shade of red. "Our relationship with Stark Group remains strong as ever."

"Really?" I switched to the next slide, watching his expression carefully. "Then how do you explain these terminated projects? Each one was vital to our growth strategy, yet they were all canceled with minimal notice."

"Brandon did this!" Alexander's outburst earned him a sharp look from his father.

"Control yourself." Old Mr. Stark's voice could have frozen hell itself.But I caught the flicker of fear in his eyes as he studied the data. "How will this affect our IPO plans?" I took a deep breath, steeling myself for the impact of my next words."Based on current trends, we're looking at a minimum six-month delay.And that's assuming other investment firms don't follow Stark Group's lead." The silence that followed felt heavy enough to crush diamonds. I could practically see the wheels turning in Old Mr. Stark's head as he processed the implications. Fortune Corp needed that IPO - needed it desperately,if my analysis was correct. "These projections." Lawrence tried again, though his voice had lost some of its earlier confidence, "they're based on incomplete data. If we just-"

"The data speaks for itself." I met his gaze steadily, refusing to back down."Unless you'd like to explain why these particular projects were terminated?Their profit margins were well above threshold."

I watched Alexander squirm under his father's intense scrutiny,remembering how that same gaze used to terrify me. Now it just seemed...pathetic. A man desperately trying to maintain control as everything crumbled around him.


"He's always been jealous," Alexander started, then seemed to realize how childish that sounded. "I mean, the timing can't be coincidental. Right after Summer-"

"Enough." Old Mr. Stark cut him off with a sharp gesture. "This meeting is adjourned. Everyone except Alexander, leave."




I'd barely made it three steps out of the boardroom before Lawrence materialized beside me, his usual smug expression replaced by something darker.


"Miss Taylor." His voice dripped with false concern as he blocked my path."That was quite a performance in there." His face darkened. "Do you have any idea how important this IPO is to Old Mr. Stark? The damage you've done today-" "Then we should address the real issues," I interrupted, "instead of hiding uncomfortable truths." I turned to leave, done with this conversation. "You'll regret this, Summer Taylor." His words followed me down the hallway like poison. "Mark my words." I returned to my office, finally allowing myself to relax slightly. Fortune Corp had always depended heavily on Stark Group as its major backer-Brandon's family enterprise. And Brandon wasn't just any exeeutive at Stark Group; he was the CEO and future heir to the entire empire.

Alexander's branch of the Stark family was merely a small offshoot of the main line. Fortune Corp had always survived by relying on Stark Group's support.


*So this sudden withdrawal of projects and support from Stark Group...*My heart skipped a beat as a new possibility occurred to me. *Is Brandon really doing this because of me?*
###Chapter 41: You Are The Boss's Wife

**Brandon's POV**

"Sir." James's measured tone drew my attention from the city vista."Fortune Corp's will have to postpone it's IPO plans..."

"The higher they climb, the harder they fall." I settled into my custom leather chair, enjoying the weight of the moment. "They lack the ability to survive on Wall Street. Always."

"I understand, sir." James's efficiency was one of his best qualities. "I'll continue monitoring the situation."

"And Summer?" The name left my lips before I could stop it.

Something flickered across James's face -too quick to read. "Mrs. Stark raised concerns about reduced investment projects during Fortune Corp's morning meeting.Lawrence attempted to...create difficulties."

My fingers stilled on the Mont Blanc pen I'd been toying with. "Lawrence?"*That parasite dares to challenge my wife?* "His courage is... noteworthy."

"Should I..." James began.

"No." The word came out sharper than intended. "Let her handle it." *She needs to learn to navigate these waters herself.* James cleared his throat softly. "About the Windsor situation - Charles has received a formal warning from the family. Regarding the proposed $200million investment in Capital Corp, George Windsor hasn't officially commented, but appears to be allowing the situation to develop." "George Windsor." I couldn't help the dark amusement that colored my tone."That old fox knows exactly what's happening. Always has.""Charles seems unlikely toaccept defeat quietly. Especially concerning the investment-"

"She needs this." I cut him off, my mind filled with images of Summer's vulnerable strength. "Some lessons must be learned through pain to truly sink in."

The intercom buzzed. "Mr. Stark? Tommy from Finance is here with the quarterly reports."

"Send him in." I turned back to James. "Keep monitoring the Windsor situation."

Tommy entered with that particular nervousness I'd come to expect from junior staff. Harvard Business School graduate, top of his class-and currently sweating through his Armani suit.

My phone buzzed just as Tommy was setting up his presentation. Summer's contact photo lit up the screen, making something warm unfurl in my chest despite the timing. I'd changed her contact information to "Wife" in her phone yesterday, and "Husband" in mine. *Let's see if she's noticed.*

"Hello?" Her voice carried that hint of uncertainty that never failed to stir something possessive in me.

"Still not used to my new contact name?" I kept my tone light, enjoying how I could practically hear her blush through the phone.

"I..." She faltered, exactly as expected. "Busy?""Just reviewing some reports." Her voice steadied slightly. "It's trading hours-is something wrong?" "One moment." I turned my attention to Tommy,who had gone pale as he reviewed his own numbers. "Explain these quarterly figures." 
"I... I need to verify some data..." His voice cracked slightly.

"A Harvard graduate who can't understand basic financial statements?"The temperature in the room dropped several degrees. "These errors-you dared to bring them to me for signature?"

Tommy's facade cracked completely. "Mr. Stark, please let me explain..."


"Speak."

"It was... it was the CFO's suggestion." The words tumbled out in a rush."He said if it could just get past my review..."

*Interesting.* "James." I didn't need to raise my voice. "Have the CFO sent up. Immediately."

"Yes,sir."

Tommy practically fled the room, leaving his flawed reports scattered across my desk. A soft breath on the phone line reminded me Summer was still listening.

"Still there?" I gentled my tone automatically.

"Yes..." Her voice wavered slightly. "I heard..."

"Did I frighten you?" The thought bothered me more than it should have.

"No." Her voice came through clear and steady. I couldn't help but smile. "Good to hear that." "What did you actually call about?" The question carried a hint of curiosity. I paused, considering my words carefully. "Just wondering about dinner plans. Would you prefer to eat at home or go out?" "Let me get this straight," Summer's tone held equal parts amusement and 
disbelief. "You called during trading hours just to discuss dinner plans?
Mr. Stark, may I remind you that you're at work?"

"Hmm." I could perfectly picture her expression. "I'm the boss."

"Well, I'm not!" The frustration in her voice was oddly endearing. "Some of us have actual work to do!"

"You're the boss's wife."

When silence felI on her end, I frowned slightly. "Nothing to say to that?"

"You've said it all, haven't you?" Summer's resignation carried a touch of humor. "Whatever works for dinner is fine. I'm not picky."

"That won't do." My frown deepened. "Your eating habits might be hard to change, but now that you're with me, they need to improve." A thought occurred to me. "I could pick you up after work?"

"No, no, absolutely not!" Her quick refusal was almost amusing. "Our offices are on opposite sides of Manhattan. It makes no sense."

"Oh?" I arched an eyebrow. "Am I that unpleasant to be seen with?"

"That's not it at all!" The panic in her voice made my lips twitch. "You know how far apart our offices are, and during rush hour... it would waste so much of your time!" She paused, then continued more thoughtfully,"How about we meet somewhere in the middle?" She hesitated before adding softly, "What would you like? I could cook for you?" Something warm unfurled in my-chest at her offer. I caught sight of James hovering in the doorway with Robert, the CFO, and held up a hand to signal them to wait. James, ever efficient, turned to Robert. "Mr. Stark requests a moment." "Of course, of course! No rush!" Robert's quick agreement barely registered.

"The General Manager needs me," Summer said to someone on her end."Brandon, I have to go -something's come up!"

"Fine. Let me know when you're done with work?"

"I will!" She hung up quickly.

I found myself staring at the phone screen. a smile lingering at the corners of my mouth. But as James led Robert into my office,all traces of warmth vanished from my expression.

"Mr. Stark," James announced, "the CFO is here."
###Chapter 42: Confrontation

**Brandon's POV**

The smile vanished as quickly as it had appeared. "Make him wait. Ten minutes." My voice carried that particular edge that made even seasoned executives flinch. *Let him stew. Fear makes men honest.*

Through the glass walls of my office, I watched our CFO's reflection in the window. Johnson stood in the reception area, already showing wrinkles from his constant fidgeting. *Guilty men always fidget.* His eyes kept darting to his phone, probably wondering if he had time to warn Matthew.

I turned my attention back to the financial reports spread across my desk,each page meticulously annotated by James. The discrepancies were obvious now that we knew where to look - clever, but not clever enough. *Matthew, Matthew. Did you really think you could hide this from me? In my own company?* The thought almost made me smile. Almost.

"Ten minutes have passed, sir." James's voice carried that perfect neutrality that made him invaluable. He understood the game we were playing - the careful chess match where timing was everything.

"Bring him in." I didn't look up from the documents,letting the weight of silence do its work. Johnson entered with the careful steps of a man approaching his executioner. His attempt at a confident smile looked more like a grimace.Even from here, I could smell his expensive cologne - another little luxury that should have been beyond his means. *Following the money always reveals the truth.*"Mr. Stark, about this morning's report-" His voice already held a tremor.*Too easy.*"Sit." I didn't bother looking up from the documents, letting him marinate in his own anxiety. Years of experience had taught me that silence was often the most effective interrogation technique.

James caught my eye, his expression carrying the question we'd discussed earlier. A slight shake of my head was enough-we'd worked together long enough that words weren't necessary. He knew his role in this play.

"Tll prepare the SEC documents," James announced as heleft,dropping the three letters that could end any Wall Street career. The effect on Johnson was immediate and visceral - a visible tremor ran through him,and his perfectly manicured hands clutched the armrests of his chair.

I let the silence stretch, mny fingers drumming a slow, deliberate rhythm against the polished surface of my desk. Each tap seemedI to increase Johnson's discomfort. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead despite the perfectly regulated temperature of my office. *The guilty always sweat.*

"You should understand how to read a balance sheet." I picked up one of the reports, noting how his eyes followed the movement like a mouse watching a snake. "These numbers. Walk me through them."

"Mr. Stark, if you're referring to the quarterly projections, I can explain-"His words tumbled over each other in their haste to escape.

"Three months." I cut him off smoothly, watching his face for the moment of recognition. "How long have you been falsifying these accounts?"The color drained from his face so quickly I could almost hear his blood pressure drop. "Falsifying? I don't-" "Do you really think I'd call you here without evidence?" The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees as I leaned forward slightly.The movement was minimal, but its effect was immediate-Johnson pressed himself back into his chair as if trying to escape. "How much did Matthew offer you? Shares? Cash? Or something else?" "Sir, my relationship with Mr. Matthew Stark is purely professional-"The lie sat heavy in the air between us, amateur and obvious.

"Are you sure you want to stick to that story?" I stood with deliberate slowness, moving to the window like a predator circling its prey.Manhattan stretched out below, a concrete jungle where I'd spent years ensuring only the strongest - only the loyal- survived. "The SEC has become quite... zealous about financial fraud recently."

A soft knock interrupted whatever protest Johnson was about to attempt.James entered with a fresh stack of documents, his timing pefect as always.We'd choreographed this dance carefully, each movement designed to break down Johnson's already crumbling resolve.

"Tommy's complete statement has arrived, sir." James's voice carried just the right note of professional detachment.

*Perfect timing, as always.* I gestured for James to set the papers on my desk,watching Johnson's reflection in the window. The man looked ready to faint, his expensive suit now wrinkled and damp with fear sweat. *The higher they climb, the harder they fall.*

"This is interesting." I flipped through the pages with deliberate casualness,each turn of a page making Johnson flinch. "A twenty million dollar transaction through a Cayman Islands shell company. Care to explain?" Johnson's professional facade finally crumbled like a sandcastle in high tide. "Mr. Stark, please!" The words burst from him like water from a broken dam. "Matthew... he threatened my son's position at Goldman Sachs. Said if I didn't help, he'd make sure the boy never worked on Wall Street again!" "Continue." One word, but it carried the weight of an imperial command.The floodgates opened. Johnson's words tumbled out in a des perate rush- Matthew's plans, the fake accounts, the network of shell companies set up to hide the manipulation. Each confession added another nail to Matthew's coffin. By the time he finished, his expensive suit was soaked with sweat,the fabric probably ruined. *Such a waste.*

"He said you were too powerful," Johnson's voice had dropped to barely a whisper, the last gasps of a drowning man. "Said the group needed...needed balance."

"Balance." The word tasted like ashes in my mouth. I picked up my phone,pressing a single button. Within moments, two SEC agents entered the office with the silent efficiency of well-paid professionals. Johnson's face went from pale to ashen as realization dawned.

One of the agents stepped forward, his government-issue suit a stark contrast to Johnson's bespoke tailoring. "Would you come with us, please?"

I watched through the window as they led him away, his shoulders slumped in defeat. The afternoon sun caught on the surrounding skyscrapers, turning them into mirrors that reflected the power of the financial district. *Another piece removed from the board.*

"Should I alert Matthew about the investigation?" James asked once we were alone, his voice carrying that slight edge of anticipation I rarely heard.

"No." A smile curved my lips, but it held no warmth - just the satisfaction of a predator watching its trap close. "Let him enjoy his illusion of victory a little longer. Three days, James. In three days,he'll come crawling back himself."
###Chapter 43: Call Me June

**Summer's POV**
I'd just hung up with Brandon, feeling a mix of emotions I couldn't quite name. Who would have thought he'd call during work hours just to ask what I wanted to eat?

Even though I was still adjusting to our relationship, his determination to build a real life together was clear. And if he was willing to take this seriously, then I needed to make an effort to adapt too.

Brandon was right about one thing - I couldn't live in the past forever,and I couldn't keep running away. The best approach was to face things head-on and learn to accept them gracefully. After everything I'd been through. I owed it to myself to build a better life.

\---

My phone buzzed again just as I was gathering my things to leave the office. Brandon's name lit up the screen, making my heart do a little flip despite my best efforts to stay cool.

"Done with work?".

"Yeah, I'm on my way." I juggled my bag while trying to lock my office door. "Should be there in about half an hour. What about you?"

"Just left the office. I'll meet you there." I found myself smiling as I ended the call. The drive to Whole Foods gave me time to wonder what I'd gotten myself into. *Shopping with Branadon Stark? The man probably has personal chefs on speed dial.* But all thoughts of personal chefs fled mny mind when I saw him waiting at the entrance. He stood with casual grace, one hand tucked into the pocket of what had to be custom-tailored dress pants, that dangerous half-smile playing at his lips. The late afternoon sun caught the sharp angles of his face, softening themn just enough to make my breath catch.
"Where's your car?" I asked, trying to focus on anything other than how the evening light caught his perfect features.
"James drove it back." His smile widened slightly at whatever he saw in my expression.

"Oh!" I knew I was staring, but I couldn't help it. Something about seeing him in this casual setting, away from the intensity of Wall Street, made him seem almost... approachable.*Almost.*

"My wife doesn't seem pleased?" The amusement in his voice snapped me back to reality.

"What? No! You must be seeing things!" Heat crept up my neck as I realized I'd been caught admiring him.

"Is that so?" His dark eyes held that dangerous glint I was starting to know too well. "Well, since I must be mistaken, I suppose I'll have to trouble my wife for a ride home."

"You could just call me Summer, you know." I tried to sound casual despite how my heart raced every time he said 'wife'.

"I like Summer," His hand came up to brush a strand of hair behind my ear, the gesture so gentle it made my heart race. "But I prefer this. "Then... maybe use a nickname?" I suggested,desperate to find an alternative to the formal 'wife' that made my stomach do backflips every time."I don't want to use names others call you." The intensity in his gaze made me forget to breathe for a moment. "Wife suits you perfectly. It's something only I can call you."

"Then think of something else that only you would use?" I couldn't quite keep the plea from my voice. *Anything but 'wife'- it makes me too aware of...everything.*

His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile. "I'll consider it."


"Oh!" The word came out embarrassingly breathy.

"Haven't thought of the right one yet." He gestured toward the store entrance.

Inside, watching Brandon navigate the produce section with practiced ease made something warm unfurl in my chest. "What foods do you like?" I asked, trying to focus on practical matters. "I should know your preferences if I'm going to be cooking. Are there things you don't eat?"

"I'm not particularly picky." Hlis long fingers drummed a gentle rhythm against the shopping cart handle. "As long as it's properly cooked. Though..." He paused, studying the sparse contents of our cart. "Is this alI you're planning to get? What about vegetables?"

"Can't we just grab whatever?" I gestured vaguely at the produce displays."They're all basically the same, right?"

"Not actually. So my wife prefers meat dishes?" The amusement in his voice made me blush.

"Yeah!" I couldn't help smiling at the memory. "When I was little, I used to love Grandpa Thompson's cooking. I can't make it quite as well as he did,but I always ate so mnuch when he cooked, especially the meat dishes."
Heat crept up my neck as I realized I was rambling. "Is that weird?"

"Not at all." His dark eyes held mine with unexpected warmth. Watching him expertly select vegetables and check produce quality, I couldin't help commenting. "Maybe I should just let you handle all the cooking!"
"If that's what my wife prefers." His casual acceptance made my heart do a complicated flip.
"I thought you were going to think of a different name for me?" I tried to change the subject before my face could get any redder.
"Still considering options." His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile that never failed to make my pulse race.
"You could call me June." The words tumbled out before I could stop them."I was born in June. Grandpa used to say it was when summer really began, so he called me that when I was little."

Something flickered across his face - surprise maybe?-before his expression settled into that familiar gentle intensity. "June..." He said it like he was tasting the word, and something about the way it rolled off his tongue made my stomach flutter. "I'll think about it."

As we continued through the store, I found myself studying him with new eyes. The way he moved - elegant and purposeful even doing something as mundane as grocery shopping. The quiet authority in his bearing that made other shoppers unconsciously step aside. Even here,in fluorescent-lit aisles between cereal boxes and canned goods, he carried himself with that natural grace that seemed to come as easily as breathing.*This is my husband,* I thought, watching him compare two different brands of soy sauce with the same intensity he probably used to evaluate million-dollar deals. The word still felt foreign,but something about seeing him like this - so capable and yet so... human - made it feel a little more real. A little less overwhelming."You're staring again. June." His voice carried that dangerous edge of amusement.

"Am not! Wait, what did you call me?"
###Chapter 44: Please Forgive My Husband


**Summer's POV**
"June." Brandon said, eyeing me. "We were both born in June, when summer really begins... You grandpa don't call you that now, does he?"
I shook my head, something warm unfurling in my chest at the way he said it. The nickname Grandpa used to use felt different coming from Brandon's lips- more intimate somehow, like a secret shared between us.

His dark eyes studied my reaction, and something in that intense gaze made mny pulse skip. The way he watched me- like he was cataloging every micro-expression, every subtle shift in my features - should have been unnerving. Instead, I found myself holding my breath, waiting for his verdict.

"Good." That dangerous half-smile played at his lips,the one that never failed to make my stomach do complicated flips. "It suits you." His voice dropped lower, carrying that velvet-soft quality that sent shivers down my spine."My June."

*My June.* The possessive note in his voice made heat creep up my neck.It was better than 'wife', at least - that title he'd been using all day that made me hyper-aware of our new status. But there was something about the way he said this nickname, like he was claiming it as something just between us, that made my heart race even faster.I tried to distract myself by watching him navigate Whole Foods. His long fingers moved with surprising delicacy as he tested the ripeness of a peach,and I caught myself staring at the way his rolled-up sleeves revealed his forearms.*Stop it,* I scolded myself. *They're just forearms.* "These need to be eaten fresh," he said, expertly examining some heirloom tomatoes. "Three days maximum." I quickly put back the extra ones I'd grabbed. "Oh, right.I didn't think about that."
His eyes caught mine, that hint of amusement I was starting to recognize dancing in their depths. "First time grocery shopping properly?"
"Hey! I shop for groceries!" But even I had to admit my usual shopping habits involved a lot more instant meals and a lot less...whatever that exotic-looking vegetable was that he'd just added to our cart.
I was so busy watching him examine an artichoke (*who knew vegetables required such careful inspection?*) that I didn't notice the runaway shopping cart until it was too late.
"Ow!" The metal frame caught my leg hard enough to make me stumble.Brandon's arm shot out to steady me, but the damage was already done.

"Oh my god, I'm so sorry!" A harried-looking woman hurried over, her bag swinging wildly as she tried to corral a child who seemed more interested in his iPhone than the havoc his mother's cart had caused. "I was just trying to stop him from-are you okay?"

Before I could respond, Brandon was already crouching to examine my leg,his touch surprisingly gentle as he checked for injury. "Does it hurt?" "I'm fine," I started to say, but couldn't quite suppress a wince as his fingers found a tender spot. But it wasn't what I was focused on - it was the way Brandon's jaw clenched when he saw my reaction to the pain, the barely perceptible tightening of his fingers on my waist."Brandon," I said softly, resting my hand on his shoulder. The expensive fabric of his shirt couldn't quite hide how tense his muscles were. "Really, I'm okay." His dark eyes met mine, and the intensity in them made my breath catch.We stayed like that for a moment, caught in some strange bubble where the bustling store around us seemed to fade away. Then his hand moved from my waist to brush against my cheek, so quickly I might have imagined it if not for the lingering warmth of his touch.
"I'm really sorry!" The woman was still apologizing, though her voice faltered slightly when Brandon straightened to his full height,his expression making the temperature around us drop several degrees."Should we...do you need a doctor?"

"It's okay," I said quickly, recognizing the look in Brandon's eyes. "Really,I'm fine. These things happen."

The woman glanced between us, clearly picking up on Brandon's displeasure. "Are you sure? I could..."
"We're fine." Brandon's tone could have frozen hell itself. The woman beat a hasty retreat, practically dragging her oblivious child behind her.

"You didn't have to scare her," I said, trying to take a step and immediately regretting it. "It was an accident."

Brandon's eyes narrowed as he watched me wobble. "You're limping."

"Just a little!" But before I could protest further, he'd swept me up into his arms like I weighed nothing. "What are you doing? Put me down!"

Instead of answering, he deposited me directly into the shopping cart,ignoring my squeak of protest. "Brandon Stark! You can't just..." "Don't move." The command in his voice made me pause mid-struggle."Unless you'd prefer the hospital?"I slumped back against the cart, face burning as I noticed other shoppers trying (and failing) not to stare. "This is ridiculous. I'm not a child!" "Either this or the hospital." His lips curved into that infuriating half-smile. "Choose."
"Fine!" I crossed my arms, trying to maintain some dignity despite my position. "But can we at least hurry? Everyone's staring!"

Something dangerous glinted in his eyes. "Want to go faster?"

"What do you mean -*eek!*" The cart shot forward as Brandon gave it a push, sending us zooming down the aisle. My hair whipped around my face as we took a corner at what had to beillegal shopping cart speed."Brandon! Slow down!"

But I couldn't quite keep the laughter from my voice, and I swore I saw his smile widen slightly. We must have looked absolutely ridiculous - the CEO of Stark Group pushing his wife around Whole Foods like a scene from some romantic comedy. But somehow, I couldn't bring myself to care.

"Over there!" I pointed excitedly at the beauty section. "I need face wash!"

"Done." He smoothly-guided the cart in that direction, adding items to the basket around me with efficient grace.

We might have gotten away with it if I hadn't gotten a bit too enthusiastic about pointing out items, nearly tipping the cart in my excitement. The store security guard who approached us looked like he was having the worst day of his life.

"Sir, ma'am," he said with admirable professionalism despite the situation,"you're disturbing other customers."Brandon's expression could have melted steel. "And?" "Listen, sir..." The guard's face reddened. "Oh no, there's been a misunderstanding!" I cut in quickly, recognizing the signs of imnpending Brandon Stark intimidation. "We're really sorry about this. It's my fault for getting carried away." I gave the guard my most apologetic smile. "Please forgive my husband-he's not very good with words. Right. honey?"
###Chapter 45: A Stark's Apology

**Summer's POV**
I gave the security guard my most apologetic smile while gently tugging on Brandon's sleeve. The tension in the Whole Foods aisle was thick enough to cut with a knife, and I could practically feel Brandon's irritation radiating off him in waves.

The security guard -a middle-aged man who looked like he'd rather be anywhere else-shifted uncomfortably under Brandon's arctic glare. "Ma'am,we have policies about customer safety..."

"Of course you do!" I jumped in quickly before Brandon could say whatever was clearly brewing behind those dangerous dark eyes. "And you're absolutely right. We got a bit carried away, and it won't happen again."

Brandon's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. I knew that look - it was the same one he got right before destroying someone's career on Wall Street. *God, he's really not used to backing down, is he?*

"It's fine," I said softly, my fingers finding his wrist. "Really."

The security guard watched our interaction with visible relief as the temperature in the aisle seemed to drop back to normal levels. "Well,ma'am, you seem reasonable enough." The guard straightened his shoulders, clearly more comfortable addressing me than Brandon. "Since no damage was done, we'll let it slide this time. But you and your husband need to be more careful in public spaces. With our customer volume, safety has to be the priority." I nodded enthusiastically, "Absolutely. We completely understand,don't we?" I gave Brandon's sleeve another gentle tug. The silence stretched for what felt like hours but was probably only seconds. Then, just when I thought we'd be stuck in this standoff forever,Brandon did something that made my jaw drop.

"My apologies for the disturbance."

The words came out perfectly polite, though I caught the barest edge of ice in his tone. Still, the fact that Brandon Stark-*the*Brandon Stark-had actually apologized... *Is this really happening?*
The security guard looked as stunned as I felt, though he covered it quickly with a professional nod. "Right, well... just be more careful.Especially with the shopping carts."

As the guard walked away, I caught several other shoppers quickly averting their gazes. *Great. We probably just made someone's Instagram story.* The thought of Wall Street's most feared CEO being caught zooming around Whole Foods with his wife in a shopping cart was almost enough to make me laugh. Almost.

"Are you actually pouting?" I couldn't heIp asking as we made our way to the checkout. Brandon's expression was doing something complicated that on anyone else I would have definitely called a sulk.

"I don't pout." His voice carried that dangerous edge that probably sent junior executives running for cover.

"Mmhmm." I bit back a smile as I started unloading our cart. "You know,most people just say 'sorry' instead of..." His dark eyes fixed on me with that intensity that never failed to make my pulse skip. "I am not most people."

  "Trust me, I noticed." The words came out softer than I intended. Just then, James materialízed beside us. "Sir, I apologize for the delay.The Manhattan traffic..." "You could have been later." Brandon's tone could have frozen hell itself.

James, bless him, didn't even blink. "The construction on Fifth Avenue,sir..



"Just help with the bags." Brandon cut him off, though I caught the slight softening in his expression. Whatever James had been late for, it had apparently worked out in Brandon's favor.
The drive home started with me behind the wheel, trying not to feel too self-conscious about driving such an expensive car.
"Relax your grip on the steering wheel," Brandon instructed from the passenger seat. "You're not strangling a snake."
I forced my fingers to loosen slightly. "Easy for you to say. This car probably costs more than my annual salary."
"The car is insured." His voice carried that hint of amusement I was starting to recognize.."And I trust your driving more than your vegetable storage habits."

"Hey!" I couldn't help laughing despite my nerves. "I store vegetables just fine!"

I merged onto the highway,starting to feel more comfortable with the powerful engine. "You know, when you apologized back there..."
  
"Mm?" "I don't think I've ever seen you apologize to anyone before." His fingers tapped a gentle rhythm against the steering wheel. "I haven't." The casual admssion made something warm unfurl in my chest. "So why... "You know why." His voice carried that velvet-soft quality that sent shivers down my spine.
I did know why, and that knowledge made my heart do complicated things. Brandon Stark, the man who brought Wall Street titans to their knees, had apologized to a grocery store security guard. Because of me.
"About Fortune Corp." I said quickly, desperate to change the subject before my face could get any redder. "The reduced investments and terminated projects... that was you, wasn't it?"
His dark eyes flickered to mine for just a moment. "You're smart enough to figure that out."

"But why?" The question had been burning in my mind ever since I noticed the pattern. "Fortune Corp depends on Stark Group's support.Without your investment projects..."

"Sometimes," his voice dropped lower, carrying an edge of something dangerous, "people need to learn the cost of their choices."

The weight of his words hung between us. *He's doing this because of what they did to me,* I realized with a jolt. *He's systematically dismantling their foundation because they tried to hurt me.*

"You shouldn't..." I started, then stopped, not sure how to finish that thought. Shouldn't what? Shouldn't use his power to protect me? Shouldn't care enough to want revenge? "I do what I want, June," The way he said my nickname - soft but intense -made mny pulse skip. "Always have." I guided the Porsche into the Hamptons estate garage with probably more concentration than necessary, determined not to scratch Brandon's car on my first day driving it. As I turned off the engine, I felt oddly proud of managing the drive without any incidents. "Not bad." Brandon commented.
"Really?" I turned to him with a smile I couldn't quite suppress."No criticisms about my turning speed or gear changes?"
His dark eyes held mine with unexpected warmth. "You did well. June."

"Brandon?" I reached over to touch his sleeve, the expensive fabric smooth under my fingers.
###Chapter 46: She's Mine

**Summer's POV**
I found myself picking at a loose thread on my sleeve, unable to meet his intense gaze. "So Fortune Corp is really finished?"
Brandon studied me with that unsettlingfocus I was starting to know too well. "What's wrong? Having second thoughts?"
"You know that's not what I mean." I caught my lower lip between my teeth, hesitating. "Does it have to be this way?"
"The company's situation isn't something you need to worry about right now." His voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse skip. "Some things are better left unexplained until the right time."
"But if Fortune Corp goes under, what am I supposed to do?" The question burst out before I could stop it.

"I've told you before - you're smart." The casual confidence in his tone made something warm unfurl in my chest. "Finding a better position won't be an issue."

Heat crept up my neck as I realized how my concerns might sound."I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't be asking about Stark Group's internal matters."

"No." His dark eyes met mine briefly before returning to the road. "If you want to know, I can tell you." "It's fine." I swallowed hard, suddenly very aware of my position."I'm not a Stark Group employee,after all." "Need any help?" I leaned against the kitchen island, trying to look casual despite how my heart raced every time he rolled up his sleeves."I cancook too,you know."
His lips curved into half-smile. "You can wash the vegetables. There'll be plenty of chances for you to cook in the future. Why the rush?"
"Right." My body tensed slightly at his knowing tone.

The peaceful domestic moment was shattered by the sudden sound of the doorbell. I glanced at Brandon, surprised. "Who could that be at this hour?


His eyes narrowed slightly. "Go ahead and answer it."

I made my way to the door, wondering who would visit Brandon's private sanctuary unannounced. The moment I opened it, I let out a startled yelp and stumbled backward. A massive German Shepherd bounded forward,nearly knocking me over in its enthusiasm.

"I..." My voice came out as a squeak as I pressed myself against the wall.

Brandon appeared beside me in an instant. "What's going on?" His eyes found Dr. Sean standing in the doorway. "What are you doing here?"

"Heard Summer just moved in!" Dr. Sean's easy smile didn't falter under Brandon's cold stare. "Came to celebrate! Don't worry, Max is very intuitive -he only gets this excited around people he likes."

I managed a weak laugh, my heart still racing from the surprise encounter.

"Showing up uninvited?" Brandon's tone could have frozen hell itself. "Aw,come on! Surely Summer doesn't mind?" Dr. Sean's eyes danced with barely suppressed mischief. "I'll go check on things in the kitchen." I started to edge away,but Brandon's hand caught mine. "Were you scared?" His voice softened as he studied my face.

"It's nothing." I tried to smile despite my still-racing pulse. "Just startled me for a moment. You two catch up - I'lI get dinner ready."
I retreated to the kitchen, but their voices carried clearly as they moved toward the living room area. I couldn't help but listen as I pretended to be busy with dinner preparations.
"Going for the warm and caring husband angle?" Dr. Sean's teasing voice made me blush. "That's new."

*God,do they have to discuss this where I can hear them?* I focused intently on chopping vegetables, trying to ignore the conversation while simultaneously straining to catch every word.
"You know, this isn't very brotherly of you." Dr. Sean continued. "The rest of us are still single."

"Is that so?" Brandon's tone carried a dangerous edge that made me shiver even from the kitchen. "Should I call her back to hear this?"

"Brandon Stark, you're doing this on purpose, aren't you?" There was a pause, and I could practically picture Dr. Sean's grin. "Come on,what's really going on here?"

"You tell me. Why are you really here?" I heard movement, and their voices grew clearer as they approached the kitchen area. *Are they really going to continue this conversation right here?* My hands trembled slightly as I focused on stirring the pot,hyper-aware of their presence. "Like I said - celebrating! We were all supposed to get together,but clearly you're not readdy for that yet. If the others can't meet her, I had to at least check things out myself." There was a pause. "Max, sit!" "Are you serious about this?"
"We're legally married. What do you think?" Brandon's response made my heart skip despite its clipped tone.
"Alright, truth time." Dr. Sean's voice grew more serious. "You know how busy I've beenlately, and Max hates the hospital environment."
"You want to leave Max here? You saw how Summer reacted to him." The protective note in Brandon's voice made something warm flutter in my chest.

"Why not leave him with Edward?"

"You think I haven't thought of that? But you know Edward-he only likes his own dogs. I wouldn't be here if I had another option. I have to go to Boston for a medical conference the day after tomorrow."

"No way, Summer doesn't like it."

"Summer, Summer, Summer... Is everything's about Summer?"

I couldn't contain my curiosity any longer and peeked around the corner."What's about me?"

Dr.Sean turned those pleading eyes on me. "Summer, I'm desperate here.You wouldn't let Max stay home alone for a week without food or water,would you?" "He needs to be away for a week," Brandon explained, his dark eyes studying my reaction. "If you're comfortable with it, we can watch Max.If not,they'll leave right now." *He's actually asking my opinion instead of just deciding?* The realization made me pause. "I.., don't mind." "Max is super low maintenance!" Dr. Sean jumped in quickly. "Just give him a corner, and if you don't like him around, just keep him at a distance.


1
A sudden burning smell hit my nose. "Oh no.my stew!"

"Summer is... not bad at all." Dr. Sean's appreciation was evident in his tone.
"She's mine." Brandon's casual possessiveness made my cheeks flush.He turned to Dr. Sean. "Now that that's settled, isn't it time for you to leave?"
"Leave? No way! It's been ages since I visited, and it's dinner time! I remember the last time I had your cooking. Summer- it was amazing."

Brandon's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Sean, are you looking for a fight?"
###Chapter 47: June, Your Taste Is Already Per fect
**Brandon's POV*
Despite my reluctance, Sean had successfully managed to stay for dinner.As I watched him sitting at my dining table, playing with Max while deliberately ignoring my cold stares, I couldn't help but wonder why I'd tolerated him all these years. But that thought vanished the moment Summer walked in with the final dish.

The scent of Summer's cooking filled the room, transforming the usually austere space into something warmer, more intimate. I watched from the doorway as she moved around my kitchen with growing confidence, her simple movements holding my attention more than they should have.

"This is amazing!" Sean's enthusiastic praise made Summer blush, the color spreading across her cheeks in a way that stirred something possessive in my chest. "Brandon, where have you been hiding this amazing cook?"

I shot him a warning look, but he just grinnedclearly enjoying himself too much to take the hint. "The food is perfect as is," I said, my eyes finding Summer's. "No need for excessive praise." After dinner, Summer insisted on clearing the dishes despite my objections."I'm sure you have things to discuss." she said, waving us off. Sean raised an eyebrow at me as we headed upstairs to my study,but wisely kept his mouth shut until the door closed behind us. Max, his German Shepherd, had settled himself outside the kitchen, clearly hoping She ducked her head, but not before I caught the small smile playing at her lips. The sight made something warm unfurl in my chest, a feeling I wasn't quite ready to examine too closely. for scraps from Summer.

I pulled out two cigars, offering one to Sean. The familiar ritual gave me a moment to study his expression -something was bothering him,beyond his usual dramatic tendencies.

"Spill it." I said, lighting my cigar.
Sean's usual playful demeanor faded slightly. "StiIl reading me like a book,huh?"

"I wish I didn't have to." I took a slow drag, letting the silence build."What's happening with the Sullivans?"

His smile turned brittle. "What else? That damn cousin of mine. Michael Sullivan's decided to grace New York with his presence."

"Michael?" The name sparked a memory - ambitious, reckless, with none of Sean's natural charm to smooth over his rough edges. "Wasn't he settled in Boston?"

"You'd think." Sean ran a hand through his hair, a nervous tell I hadn't seen since our college days. "The family's in an uproar. You know how they feel about his...methods."

"You're not involved in the family business," I pointed out. "Why does this concern you?" "Because he's making it my concern!" The frustration in Sean's voice was real. "The medical conference is just an excuse. I need to lay low until he leaves town." "First time I've seen you run from anyone." I couldn't help the slight amusement in my tone. "Besides her." The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. Sean's expression shuttered, all traces of his usual warmth vanishing."Low blow.man. You were involved in that too,remember?"
"You brought it up." My voice carried an edge of ice. "I wasn't helping you-you were wrong for her."
"And who was right?" The bitterness in his voice surprised me. "You?"

"Anyone but you." The words came out sharper than intended. "You promised to let her go. You owed her that much."
"She probably still resents you for it." Sean's laugh held no humor. "Her own brother, taking my side."

"That's none of your business." The cigar had burned down to ash,forgotten in my hand. "Don't mistake my silence for approval. She wasn't right for you, and she wasn't right for the Stark family."

Sean studied me for a long moment, something calculating replacing his usual easy charm. "Speaking of family... word is you're making moves against Matthew? He might not be a Wall Street tiger, but even cats have claws."

"Take care." I said instead of acknowledging his warning. Some games were better played close to the chest.

By the time we headed back downstairs, Summer had prepared iced tea.The sight of her ín my kitchen, so naturally domestic, did something complicated to my chest. "Sorry, can't stay!" Sean called out, already heading for the door. "Got some follow-ups at the hospital. You two enjoy!" I watched Summer's face fall slightly at Sean's abrupt departure. "Want to try?"she asked, holding out a glass. "I made it earlier, justremembered it was in the fridge." The tea was perfect - exactly the right balance of flavors, served at the ideal temperature. Of course it was. Summer had that gift for getting things right. even when she didn't realize it.
"You're in Fortune Corp's project department?" I kept my voice casual,though the question was anything but.
She nodded, something guarded creeping into her expression. "Yes. Why?"


"Ever considered leaving?"

The way she tensed told me everything about how much thought she'd already given this idea. "What's your reasonfor asking?"
"Fortune Corp has hit its ceiling." I set down my glass,choosing my words carefully. "Old Mr. Stark lacks vision. He's trying to milk benefits from Stark Group instead of leveraging our resources for growth. A company like that will never thrive."

Summer pressed her lips together thoughtfully. "I may not understand things from your perspective as CEO, but Fortune Corp has had issues for a long time now. It's not exactly news."

"Why did you choose to join Fortune in the first place?" I asked.

"If I said it was for personal reasons," she said slowly, "would you think less of me?" "No." The word came out more forcefully than I intended. "Everyone misjudges people sometimes. Your judgment's better now - that's what matters." She twisted her fingers nervously, a gesture I was coming to know well. "I've always known I couldn't join Capital Corp. Never knew why, but I didn't really care either." A bitter laugh escaped her. "Sometimes I wonder,are these things really that important? Victoria and I never got along, and Alexander chose her because of these things."

"They are important." I moved closer. unable to stop myself from reaching out to still her restless hands. "You don't not care - you just understand there's a limit to their value. Compared to family, they seemed less important."
"But what would fighting get me?" The vulnerability in her voice made something protective stir in my chest. "I don't want that. Don't want to make things worse."

"You think things aren't bad now?" I couldn't keep the edge from my voice. "Haven't you noticed - the more you give in, the more they'll take?"

She looked up at me then, really looked, and something in her expression made my breath catch. "Do what you need to do," she said softly. "I'm just an employee there - you don't need to consider my feelings." A pause,then: "Want more iced tea?"

"Yes."

I watched her pour another glass, her movements graceful and precise.Something about seeing her here, in my space, felt dangerously right. Like a piece clicking into place that I hadn't known was missing.

"June." Summer's eyes widened at my words. "Your taste is already perfect.Don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
###Chapter 48: Old Friend

**Summer's POV*

The next day, I found myself speaking with Amy in my office.

"Something's off about these numbers." I frowned at the spreadsheet on my desk, tapping my pen against the polished wood.
Amy leaned over my shoulder, "The withdrawal patterns are too systematic."she agreed. highlighting another row of data. "It's almost like-"
My phone's sudden buzz made us both jump. The familiar ringtone cut through the afternoon quiet of my Fortune Corp office, and something in my chest tightened when I saw the caller ID. *No way...*

"Hello?"

"Hey girl! Come pick me up!"

The voice hit me like a physical shock. "Ruby? You're back in New York?"

"Yep, your girl's back!" Her laugh hadn't changed at all, still carrying that infectious energy that had gotten us through countless all-nighters at Columbia. "Less talk, more action - comeget me!"

"Where are you?" My voice cracked with excitement. "Why didn't you tell me you were coming?" "Tell you later. I'm near Columbia. Car trouble, of course." Her tone carried that familiar mix of exasperation and amusement that made me want to laugh despite myself. "Got it, I'll be right there!"I turned to Amy, already gathering my things. "Something came up and I need to head out. Let's wrap up for today. If anyone asks, just say I'm out. 
Amy's eyes flickered toward the door before returning to me."′′Okqy.But if Mr. Alexander Stark comes..."
"Don't worry about him, and don't tell him where I went!" The keys to Brandon's Porsche felt warm in my palm as I headed for the door. "Oh.and those files for the Stark Group project -give them directlyto Mr.Stark.Tell him I'm out doing field research."
The familiar streets around Columbia brought back a flood of memories as I navigated the Porsche through afternoon traffic.
I spotted Ruby before she saw me - the bright yellow sundress was impossible to miss, even if everything else about her had changed.Her once-long hair was now cut in a stylish bob, and her skin had darkened to a rich tan that spoke of serious time in the sun. She stood on the corner of 116th Street, somehow managing to juggle two ice cream cones while waving frantically with her free hand.

"Over here!"

"You've lost weight!" I couldn't help staring as I pulled up to the curb."And you're so tan! Why did you cut your hair? It was so beautiful!"

Ruby rolled her eyes, passing me one of the ice cream cones before climbing into the passenger seat. "Beautiful? Try maintaining long hair in Africa! Had to go practical. Plus it's way cooler like this!" "Africa?" I nearly dropped my ice cream. "What were you doing there?" "War correspondent." She grinned at my shocked expression. "What? Di you think I'd stay in Manhattan forever? Though speaking of changes...Her eyes traveled over the Porsche's interior with obvious appreciation. "Nice wheels! You're doing well for yourself!" Heat crept up my neck. "It's nothing special. I'm just an employee. If you're talking about the Porsche, it's my husband's."
The ice cream cone stopped halfway to Ruby's mouth. "Husband? What's going on? You said you and Alexander didn't get married?"
"We didn't." I kept my eyes fixed on the road ahead,grateful for the excuse not to meet her gaze. "I married someone else. It's... complicated."

Then I explained what had happened to Ruby briefly.

"So you married a guy you barely knew for a month?" The concern in her voice made my chest ache.

"Don't look at me like that. It's... not what you think."

Before she could respond, my phone buzzed. Brandon's name lit up the screen. making my pulse skip despite my best efforts to stay cool.
"It's me." His deep voice carried through the speaker. "When are you finishing work?"

"I... you might need to handle dinner yourself tonight."

"Hmm? Why's that? Meeting someone?"

"Yes, I'm out with a friend right now!"

"Tell your husband to join us!" Ruby called out, loud enough that I knew Brandon must have heard."Stop it!" I hissed, but Ruby just grinned wickedly. "Friend?" Something in Brandon's tone made my skin prickle. "Male or female?" "Hey Summer, let's meet this husband of yours!" Ruby's voice carried clear mischief. "You're married now, right? As your best friend, I need to check if he's hotl If he's not up to standard, dump him-I'll find you someone way better looking than that jerk Alexander!"
He+Sgood looking, he's good looking!" I felt my face flame. "Ruby,please stop!"
"Um...my friend's a bit crazy, just ignore her." I wanted tosink into the leather seats and disappear.

"I see." Was that amusement in his voice? "If it's your best friend,spend time with her.June."

My heart did a complicated flip at the nickname. "Huh? What is it?"


"Nothing.Come home soon."

"Okay, this won't take long. Um... what do you want to eat? I can bring something back?"

"Alright. I'll wait for you."

The moment I hung up, Ruby pounced. "Ooh, so your husband IS hot!"


"You're impossible!"

"What? How is this my fault? 'Husband'? Seems like you two get along pretty well?"

I couldn't quite hide my smile. "'It's... okay. He's not bad."

Ruby's expression softened. "As long as he treats you right. I was worried about the Alexander and Victoria situation affecting you, but seeing you now, I feel better. Stop being shy - if you're married, make the best of it.Bring him around sometime!"


"Okay!" The word came out more enthusiastic than I'd intended.
We ended up at our old favorite restaurant near campus. the familiar smells bringing back a rush of memories. Ruby caught me up on her adventures-the wildlife conservation projects in Africa, her new job at a major news outlet, the crazy stories she'd collected along the way. It felt like no time had passed at all.
My phone buzzed again just as we were finishing dessert. It was Brandon again.
"Stay out longer with your friend." His voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse race.

"What? But you haven't had dinner- I was going to bring you something."


"Don't worry about it. I need to go out."

The silence stretched between us for a moment.

"I need to return to the Stark mansion." Something in his tone made me pause. "Some matters to attend to."

"Oh! That's fine then, go ahead. I'll stay out with Ruby a bit longer!"


But even after I hung up, something felt off.

"Earth to Summer!" Ruby waved her hand in front of my face."You're thinking about him again, aren't you?"

"What? No!" But the heat in my cheeks betrayed me. Ruby's grin turned knowing. "Girl, you've got it bad! But hey, at least this one seems better than Alexander. I mean, letting you use his fancy car?Actually caring about where you are and who you're with? That's already a huge upgrade!" I walked Ruby backs to her hotel, promising to meet up again soon. But as I drove home alone in Brandon's Porsche, the emptiness of the passenger seat felt more noticeable than usual. The familiar route to the Hamptons estate stretched out before me. and I couldn't help wondering what"matters" had called Brandon back to the Stark mansion.
###Chapter 49: Just This Once

**Brandon's POV**
The Stark mansion materialized out of the gathering dusk, its imposing silhouette a reminder of everything I'd spent years trying to leave behind.The familiar drive felt longer than usual, each turn bringing back memories I'd rather forget.
"Welcome back, sir." The butler's carefully neutral tone carried years of practice as I pulled up to the entrance.

I lowered the window slightly. "Who's home?"

"Your father and grandfather are both in residence, sir. Your sister has also arrived."

*Sarah.* The name alone made something tighten in my chest. I nodded curtly and guided the car toward the garage, already regretting my decision to come. Butsome battles needed to be fought in person.

"Uncle Brandon!"

The high-pitched squeal of delight was my only warning before a small figure launched itself at me the moment I stepped out of the car. I caught Angela instinctively, years of practice taking over as my niece wrapped her arms around my neck. "How did you get here?" I couldn't quite keep the surprise from my voice.The garage wasn't exactly a typical hangout spot for seven-year-olds.

 Angela's round face lit up with that innocent joy that made her the only true bright spot in this family. "With mommy! We came to see you!" She planted a wet kiss on my cheek, completely unfazed by my usual stern demeanor. "Did you bring me a present?"I found myself smiling despite everything, the expression feeling foreign on my face. "And why would I have a present?”
"Because you always do!" She pouted adorably. "Mommy says you never come home anymore. Why don't you visit us?"
Something warm and complicated unfured in my chest, but I kept my expression neutral. "We'll see each other soon."
"Sarah." I acknowledged my sister's presence without turning.Her footsteps had always been distinctive - cautious, hesitant, like she was perpetually walking on eggshells.

"Brandon." The tension in her voice was familiar too. "Father and Grandfather are waiting."

Angela's small hand found mine as we walked toward the main house,her cheerful chatter a buffer against the storm I knew was brewing.The entrance hall hadn't changed-still the same oppressive grandeur,still the same portraits of Stark patriarchs glaring down from the walls.

"That troublemaker's finally here?" William Stark's voice carried clearly from the study, sharp wwith displeasure. Same tone he'd used since I was fifteen and refused to follow his precious "traditional" path.

"Father." Robert Stark's attempt at peacekeeping was as ineffective as ever."Brandon's not a child anymore.""Not a child?" The scoff in William's voice could have stripped paint. "Look at what he's doing to Stark Group! Throwing out loyal employees,dismantling decades of tradition..." I let their voices wash over me as I guided Angela toward the study. She skipped beside me, completely oblivious to the tension crackling through the air.*At least someone in this family still has their innocence.* The study door opened before us, revealing the familiar tableau-William in his throne-like chair. Robert hovering nearby like an anxious courtier.Sarah perched on the edge of a sofa as if ready to flee at any moment.
"Great-grandpa!" Angela's enthusiasm cut through the tension like a knife through butter. "Uncle Brandon's here!"
William's expression softened slightly as it always did for Angela, but his eyes remained cold when they fixed on me. "So, the prodigal son returns."
"Grandfather." I kept my voice neutral as I settled into one of the leather chairs,positioning myself so I could see everyone's faces. "You wanted to see me?"

He tossed a folder onto the coffee table between us. "Matthew's complaint.Care to explain yourself?"

I picked up the folder without opening it, already knowing its contents."Explain what? That one of your old guard has been embezzling company funds? Or that he thought his connection to you would protect him?"

"You ungrateful-" William started to rise, but Robert placed a warning hand on his shoulder.

"Brandon." My father's voice carried that particular note of disapproval I'd grown immune to years ago. "These men have served the company faithfully for decades. Your grandfather trusted them-""And that trust was misplaced." I cut him off smoothly, watching Sarah flinch at my tone. "The market has changed. Stark Group needs to evolve." "Evolution doesn't mean destroying everything we've built!" William's face had taken on that particular shade of red that usually preceded one of his legendary tirades. "No." I agreed, my voice carrying an edge that made Sarah shift nervously. "But it does mean removing dead weight."

"Brandon, please." Sarah finally spoke up, her voice barely above a whisper. "Think about what you're doing. Matthew has connections throughout the industry. If you force him out..."
"Only this once." The words dropped into the silence like stones into still water."I'll let him keep his shares, out of respect for Grandfather. But his resignation letter needs to be on my desk by morning."

"You-"William started, but I was already standing.

"Angela." I turned to my niece, who had been unusually quietduring the exchange. "Time for me to go home."

Her lower lip trembled slightly. "But Uncle Brandon, this is your home too!

n

*Home.* The word tasted bitter. I smoothed her hair gently, the gesture automatic after years of practice. "I'll seeyou soon,okay?"

The balcony offered temporary refuge from the suffocating atmosphere inside. The familiar scent of old money and older prejudices followed me out, but the cool evening air helped clear my head.

"Brandon!" Sarah's voice carried a note of desperation as she followed me out. "You can't do this!" I lit a cigarette, watching the smoke curl into the darkness. "Can't I?""He's family-" "No." I cut her off without turning. "He's your investment partner.Don't think I don't know about your little side deals." The sharp intake of breath told me I'd hit my mark. "How did you..." "I grew up watching you defend me from the nannies, Sarah."The memory almost made me smile. Almost. "But I'm not that little boy anymore. And I won't let anyone use my weakness against me-not even you."
The silence stretched between us, heavy with years of unspoken words.Finally, Sarah's quiet footsteps retreated, leaving me alone with the night air and my thoughts.



The Hamptons estate felt different when I finally returned - warmer somehow, despite the late hour. The sound of running water drew me toward the master bathroom, where steam curled invitingly through the half-open door.

Summer stood at the sink in a silk robe, her wet hair falling in dark waves down her back. She caught my reflection in the mirror and turned, those expressive eyes widening slightly.

Summer must have felt the weight of my gaze, because she suddenly followed my line of sight. Her eyes widened in realization, and she quickly crossed her arms over her chest protectively.

"Ah, you... when did you get back?" Her voicecame out higher than usual,
a flush creeping up her neck.
###Chapter 50: Making Sure He Eats Somethin


**Summer's POV**
The steamy air wrapped around me like a warm blanket as I stood in front of the master bathroom mirror, my damp hair falling in dark waves down my back. Brandon's silk robe felt impossibly soft against my skin-I'd found it hanging in the closet and couldn't resist trying it on, especially since he was supposed to be at the Stark mansion tonight.
I twisted slightly, watching how the expensive fabric caught the light. The bathroom was still filled with steam from my shower,giving everything a dreamy,surreal quality.
Then I caught a glimpse of something in the mirror that made my heart stop. *No. No way.*

Brandon stood in the doorway, his dark eyes reflecting in the foggy mirror as they traveled over my form with dangerous intensity. I spun around,suddenly very aware of how the silk clung to my still-damp skin.

"Ah, you... when did you get back?" My voice came out embarrassingly high as I crossed my arms protectively over my chest. The robe suddenly felt far too thin, too revealing.

He didn't answer immediately, just continued to study me with that predatory focus. One corner of his mouth lifted. *Move, Summer!* I edged toward where I'd left my clothes, trying to maintain some dignity despite how my cheeks burned. By the time I'd grabbed my pajamas and ducked behind the shower curtain to change, I heard his footsteps retreating. I waited until my heart stopped racing before emerging from the bathroom,but Brandon was already gone. The master bedroom felt strangely empty without his overwhelming presence. 'What just happened?* I pressed my cool palms ngainst my flaming cheeks.trying to process the last few minutes. The memory of his intense gaze made something flutter in my stomach. Get it together, Summer.He's your husband - of course he's going to see you in various states of undress eventually.*
But knowing that didn't make it any less nerve-wracking.

After what felt like hours but was probably only minutes, I finally gathered enough courage to leave the bedroom. The sound of running water from one of the guest rooms made me pause. "A cold shower?* The thought sent an unexpected shiver down my spine.
I found myself drawn to Brandon's study, seeking comfort in the familiar space. The walls of leather-bound books reminded me of Grandpa Thompson's library, and I couldn't help running my fingers along their spines as I browsed.

"Interested?"

I jumped at Brandon's voice, nearly dropping the financial history text I'd been examining. He stood in the doorway, hair still damp from his shower,looking unfairly attractive in casual clothes.

"Grandpa Thompson has these in his study too." I managed to keep my voice steady despite how my heart raced. "Now I understand why you like collecting them." One perfect eyebrow arched slightly as he moved into the room with that predatory grace that seemed to come so naturally to him. "Looking for me?" The amusement in his tone made heat creep up my neck. "I..." My fingers twisted nervously in my shirt hem. *Why did I come here again?*"Yes or no?" His dark eyes held mine with dangerous intensity.

"My friend today..." I started, desperate to change the subject. "Ruby Scott-we were classmates at Columbia. She's been working as a war correspondent in Africa, just got back..."
"Is that why you didn't stay out longer?" He settled into one of the leather chairs, his presence somehow managing to fill the entire room.
"You had dinner at the Stark mansion, right?" The question tumbled out before I could stop it.
His expression shifted slightly, something dark flickering behind his eyes.

"You didn't eat?" Concern overrode my nervousness. "Brandon! How can you skip meals? That's not good for your health!"

He studied me with that unsettling focus. "I wasn't hungry."

"But you went to the mansion..." I trailed off as his expression closed off completely.

Without another word, I headed for the kitchen. The food I'd picked up from the new French place downtown would only need minimal reheating.I'd ordered it after our phone call earlier, but then he'd suddenly needed to go to the Stark mansion. I'd thought the food would go to waste,but now... *At least I can make sure he eats something.* The thought brought an unexpected smile to my face. "What did you get?" His deep voice behind me made me jump. "Just... whatever looked good," I gestured vaguely at the containers. "Have you washed your hands?" He nodded, accepting the plate I handed him. "Join me?" "I already ate with Ruby." But I found myself settling into the chair across from him anyway, unable to resist watching as he ate with that unconscious elegance that seemed to define his every movement.

His dark eyes caught mine.
Heat flooded my cheeks. "Ruby wants to meet you," I blurted out,desperate to change the subject. "But if you're too busy, it's fine! She just..wants to make sure I'm okay."

"When?"
"Whenever works for you..." I twisted my fingers nervously. "It won't be too much trouble?"

"No." His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile. "It's rare for you to want to introduce me to your friends."

"You must be starving!" I couldn't heIp noticing how quickly he was finishing the food. "You should have eaten at the mansion!"

"Indeed." The way he said it - soft but intense - made my skin prickle.

Later, as I lay in bed exchanging voice messages with Ruby about dinner plans, I couldn't help smiling at her enthusiasm.

"Come on, bring that husband of yours out!" Ruby's voice carried through my phone speaker. "If he can give you a Porsche, he can afford the best restaurants in Manhattan!"

"He is pretty successful..." I sent back, trying to keep my voice down.

"Then let's hit the most expensive places! Make him work for it!"

I laughed, holding down the voice message button. "Foodie! So... Per Se or Le Bernardin?".

"Per Se." Brandon's voice from the doorway made me yelp and nearly drop my phone.
"You were standing there the whole time?" I tried to sound stern despite how my heart raced at his sudden appearance.
"You were talking quite loudly." His dark eyes danced with barely suppressed amusement.
"That's still..." I huffed, then paused. "Wait, so... Per Se?"
###Chapter 51: Brandon, You'll Die A Horrible Death
**Brandon's POV**

The morning sun cast long shadows across my office as I reviewed the files James had prepared. Each document told its own story-a web of deceit carefully woven by Matthew and his allies. My fingers traced the edge of a particularly damning report, a slight smile playing at my lips. *They never learn. do they?*

The intercom buzzed. "Sir, the board members are arriving early."

"Good." I didn't look up from the files. "Keep Matthew waiting."

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of my office, I could see Manhattan stretching out before me, a concrete jungle where I'd spent years ensuring only the strongest - only the loyal - survived. The timing was perfect.Matthew's desperation had made him sloppy, and now...

My phone vibrated with a message from James: "SEC agents in position."

I allowed myself a moment of satisfaction before tucking the final piece of evidence into my briefcase. The weight of June's marriage certificate brushed against my fingers - I'd taken to carrying it with me, though I'd never admit why, The thought of her brought an unexpected warmth to my chest, but I pushed it aside. *Focus. Business first.*

The boardroom fell silent as I entered, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife. Matthew sat at the far end, his usual arrogance unable to hide the nervous sweat beading on his forehead. The other directors shifted in their seats, eyes darting between us like spectators at a prizefight.

"Didn't Matthew have something to share with everyone today?" I kept my voice casual as I settled into my chair. "Brandon, do you really want to do this?" Matthew's attempt at confidence couldn't hide his unease.

"Uncle Matthew, you should know how I operate by now."

"What if I refuse?" His voice took on an edge of desperation. "You know that even though my shares aren't the majority,I still-"

"There are no 'buts'!" I cut him off sharply. "I've never liked negotiating with people who don't have enough chips to play with."

"Would you like to see what these documents contain?" I spread them across the table with deliberate precision.

"I don't believe you have anything on me." Matthew's voice cracked with false bravado. "Johnson's evidence might get me jail time at worst,but I've already sold my shares. Brandon, you think you can threaten me with this?



"Impossible!"

"This can't be!"

"How could this happen?"

One of Matthewv's allies spoke up, his voice dripping with disdain. "That's right! The annual dividends from Stark Group aren't even worth mentioning.These past few years under your leadership, Brandon, every shareholder has been suffering. We've thought it through - rather than slaving away under you, we might as well sell our shares and enjoy life." "Now that the shares aren't in our hands, we're naturally no longer Stark Group shareholders," Matthew's smirk widened. "Brandon, you think your threats still work on me?" "Mr. Matthew, don't you want to take a look?" James's professional tone carried just a hint of satisfaction.

Matthew's hands trembled as he read the documents. "You... you actually...
"

"If you had submitted your resignation earlier, this file would have remained sealed forever." I watched his face crumple as the truth sank in.

"How did you know? I don't believe it."

"Money laundering overseas, dealing with arms dealers - these aren't minor infractions." I leaned forward slightly. "Stark Group has always operated cleanly. My grandfather may have stepped down, but his rules still stand."

"When did you find out?" Matthew's voice shook. Then understanding dawned in his eyes. "You planned this all along? Letting Sarah get away?Making us sell our shares? So our shares are now..."

"At least you're not completely stupid, Uncle." My smile held no warmth. "Too bad you realized too late."


"Hah, truly a Stark, truly Robert's son!" Matthew's laugh was bitter and sharp. "Plotting against your own family - Brandon, are you even human?"

"Are you my family?" The words dropped like ice into the silence.

A knock at the door interrupted whatever he'd been about to say. "Mr.Stark, the police are downstairs for a routine questioning. They're asking for Mr.Matthew.""Brandon, you think this is enough to take me down?" Matthew's voice took on a desperate edge. "Let mé tell you, I have evidence about Sarah-" ′′Isthat so?" I met his gaze steadily. "Try it. I never fight battles I'm not certain to win, Security! Please escort Mr. Matthew and his associates out to meet the police."

"Brandon, you'll die a horrible death!" Matthew shouted as he was led away.




"Mr. Stark, Miss Sarah is here to see you! She's already in your office." My secretary's voice carried through the intercom.

"I know."


When I entered my office, Sarah was already there, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap.

"Brandon!" The relief in her voice was palpable.

I paused, my hand resting on the door handle. "This is the company."

"Mr. Stark." She corrected herself reluctantly. "Mr. Stark, I came today to..."

"To ask about today's outcome?" I settled behind my desk.

"You... Matthew didn't resign?"


"After working with him for so long, surely you know what kind of person he is?"


"So you knew everything," She studied my face.

"Yeah." "But what about his other shares in Stark Group? If he and the others sold them to outsiders, wouldn't that put the company at risk?" I slid a folder across the desk. "They're in my hands." 
"What?"

"He dumped his shares last night - moved even faster than I expected."I leaned back slightly. "And now I'm giving you your rightful portion.Angela needs you. She's still young."

Her hands trembled slightly as she realized what I was offering - not just documents, but financial independence. Freedom from Matthew's manipulation.

The relief that flooded her face made her look young again- like the sister who used to sneak me cookies when Grandfather's tutors were being particularly harsh. "Brandon, I..."

"That will be all." I turned my attention to the files on my desk, a clear dismissal.

She paused at the door. "Brandon, if you ever need anything, I'll definitely help."

I just smiled, offering no response.
###Chapter 52: Inheritance

**Summer's POV**

I was gathering my things to leave Fortune Corp. My phone's sudden buzz made me jump-Grandpa George's familiar contact photo lighting up the screen.


"Grandpa?"

"Summer, dear." His warm voice carried that particular mix of authority and affection I'd grown up with. "Are you done with work?"

I glanced at the clock, biting my lower lip. "Almost. Is everything okay?"

"Can't an old man want to see his granddaughter?" The gentle teasing in his tone made something in my chest ache. "I was thinking... I know the mansion isn't convenient right now, with your parents..." He trailed off with a soft sigh that spoke volumes. "Perhaps we could meet somewhere else?"

"Of course!" The words tumbled out before I could stop them."The St.Regis? Their tea room is nice and private."

"Perfect." His voice brightened slightly. "I'll have Jenkins make the arrangements." After hanging up, I found myself staring at Brandon's contact photo. *Should I call him?* The thought made my stomach do a little flip,but I pressed the call button anyway. ′′It2Sme!" "Hmm?" His deep voice carried a hint of surprise. "Everything alright?" "Yeah, I justn." I twisted my fingers in my blouse hem. "I might be home late tonight. Grandpa wants to see me. It seems important." There was a moment of silence, then: "Alright." Another pause. "Be careful.Call if you need anything."

"I will!"

\---

My friend Scarlett, who owned this place, greeted me at the St. Regis entrance. "Your grandfather's already waiting," she said softly, gesturing toward the private rooms. "He arrived early."

The tea room's elegant atmosphere wrapped around me like a familiar blanket as I followed the attendant. Grandpa George sat in his usual commanding pose, though something about the set of his shoulders seemed different tonight. Jenkins stood at attention nearby, his professional mask firmly in place.

"Summer!" Grandpa's face lit up as he waved me over. "Come here, dear."

"Grandpa!" I couldn't help smiling as I settled into the chair across from him."You got here early?"

He busied himself pouring tea with the same precise movements I remembered from childhood afternoons. "Work keeping you busy?"

"Not too bad." I accepted the cup gratefully, inhaling the familiar Earl Grey aroma. "What's on your mind, Grandpa? You seem..."

He set down his cup with deliberate care. "Jenkins." Jenkins moved forward smoothly, producing a leather document folder that made my stomach twist with sudden anxiety. The weight of it felt impossibly heavy as I accepted it with trembling fingers. "Grandpa?" My voice cracked slightly as I opened the folder."Capital Corp shares? Why would you..." "Because you're my granddaughter." His tone carried that particular mix of authority and affection that had always made arguing with him impossible."Victoria isn't the only Taylor heir, despite what your parents might think." He nodded to Jenkins, who produced an elegant fountain pen. "Sign the transfer documents. I've already arranged for the notary."

"I never wanted any of this," I pushed the folder away, my voice trembling."If you give me these shares now, won't they think I'm trying to compete with Victoria for thefamily fortune?" I swallowed hard, twisting my fingers in my lap. "I'm already not in my parents' good graces. If I take these shares now, they'll see me as even more of a thorn in their side."


"Let them think what they want!" Grandpa's voice carried that familiar steel. "These shares are my gift to you. Now sign the papers!"

"That's right," Jenkins stepped forward, unable to stay silent any longer."Mr. Taylor has been planning to give these to you for a long time. If you don't take them, and they end up in your sister's hands..."

"But Grandpa..."

"Summer," Grandpa's expression turned stern. "Do you want to see the Taylor family fall into outsiders' hands?"

"What do you mean?" I stared at him, confused. "Why would you say that? "The Stark family is ambitious," his eyes fixed on mine with intense focus."Why do you think Alexander wants to marry your sister? Victoria has never had a head for business - she's only interested in the entertainment industry. Capital Corp will need to be in your hands eventually." He leaned forward slightly. "The Starks may carry our name, but they're not Taylors. Do you understand?" My heart sank as his meaning became clear. "With these shares in your hands," he continued, his voice softening slightly, "no one can stop you from taking your rightful place at Capital Corp.Remember that."

"Grandpa..."

"Don't 'Grandpa' me with those eyes." But his tone softened slightly. "I'm not doing this out of pity or guilt. You're a Taylor-it's time you had the power to protect yourself."

My fingers trembled as I accepted the pen from Jenkins. Each signature felt like crossing a threshold I couldn't uncross, but Grandpa's steady presence gave me strength. When I finally finished, he tucked the documents safely away with a satisfied nod.

"There. Was that so hard?" His eyes crinkled with familiar warmth. "How are you holding up?" His eyes studied my face with grandfatherly concern."After everything that happened at the birthday party..."

I swallowed hard, forcing a smile. "I'm fine, Grandpa. Really."

"Summer." The way he said my name - gentle but firm - made tears prick at my eyes. "You don't have to pretend with me. I know what they tried to do."

"Can we... not talk about that?" My voice came out smaller than intended.

He reached across the table to pat my hand. "Alright, dear. But remember-you're stronger than they think. Than you think." The rest of our tea passed in comfortable conversation1, Grandpa sharing stories from my childhood that made me both laugh and cry. By the time we finished, the sun had long since set over Manhattan. I insisted on waiting until Grandpa and Jenkins had safely departed before leaving myself. The night air felt crisp against my face as I stepped out onto the sidewalk, my mind still spinning with everything that had happened. *Capital Corp shares. Real voting power in the family company.*The weight of it felt almost physical.
The sudden purr of a familiar engine made me jump. A sleek black Bentley pulled up beside me, the passenger window rolling down to reveal Brandon's perfect features.
"Get in." His deep voice brooked no argument as he reached across to open the door.

I slid into the butter-soft leather seat. Brandon leaned over, his cologne wrapping around me as he carefully fastened my seatbelt. The casual intimacy of the gesture made my heart race.

"How did you know where I was?" I managed to ask once my heart stopped trying to escape my chest.
His dark eyes flickered to mine for just a moment. "James mentioned seeing your car still at Fortune Corp. Thought you might need a ride."

"Oh." I couldn't quite meet his gaze. "Thank you."

His fingers drummed a gentle rhythm against the steering wheel as we merged into traffic. "Good talk with your grandfather?"

"Mm." I twisted my fingers in my lap, suddenly uncertain how to explain what had happened. "He... gave me something.""Twenty percent of the Capital Corp's shares," the weight of the document folder in my bag suddenly felt heavier, "I didn't want this. Any of it."
###Chapter 53: Brandon's Gentle Side

**Summer's POV**

"Twenty percent..." I couldn't keep the disbelief from my voice. "This is more than Victoria's shares. Why would Grandpa do this?"

Brandon's dark eyes flickered to mine for just a moment. "You seem surprised."

"Of course I'm surprised!" The words burst out before I could stop them."Do you know what this means? The power structure at Capital Corp could-"

"It's your grandfather's decision," Brandon cut me off smoothly,his deep voice carrying that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse skip. "Accept it. Don't overthink it."
I twisted my fingers nervously in my lap. "You don't seem shocked at all.Twenty percent of the shares! This makes my stake bigger than Victoria's!"
"George Taylor has his reasons." Brandon's tone remained steady as he navigated through traffic with effortless grace. "The Taylor family only has you and Victoria. And since your uncle Alan is adopted, your grandfather naturally worries about the company falling into outsiders'hands.Giving you these shares is just his way of protecting the family legacy."

"How do you know so much about our family?" I couldn't hide my surprise. "Even about Alan being adopted..." The corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile. "It's not hard to figure out."A comfortable silence fell between us as the city lights blurred past the windows, Finally, Brandon's voice broke through my swirling thoughts:"Hungry?" "What about you?" I glanced at him, suddenly concerned."Have you eaten?11

"Not yet." His dark eyes held mine for a moment. "Where would you like to go?"

"We're eating out?"

"Mm." He guided the Bentley smoothly around a corner. "It's getting late -might take too long to cook at home. But we can head back if you prefer."

"No, out is fine!" I found myself studying his profile in the passing streetlights. "Actually, I know this nice place near Columbia..."

"Tell me."

Heat crept up my neck as I explained, "It's just a regular restaurant in a mall."

"If you like it, that's enough." His voice softened slightly. "Give me the address."

As we approached the familiar streets around Columbia, memories washed over me. "It's just behind the university," I found myself saying. "Used to come here all the time during college."

"Sounds like you had an eventful college life." The amusement in his tone made my pulse skip. "Just hanging out with friends sometimes," I smiled at the memories. "It was close to campus and affordable. Haven't been back much since graduation..." I snuck a glance at him. "Oh, my friends, Ruby and Scarlett - you'd like to meet them sometime?" "Of course," His casual acceptance surprised me. "Whenever you're free." "You really want to meet my friends?" I couldn't quite keep the uncertainty from my voice.

"Why wouldn't I?"

Brandon drove with steady precision, getting us to the mall in about thirty minutes. The restaurant I'd suggested had been here since the mall first opened, a constant fixture through all my college years.

Thankfully, I'd called ahead to reserve a table - the place was packed when we arrived. I fidgeted nervously with my sleeve. "Um... we could go somewhere else!"

"No need." His hand found mine as he led us to the waiting area. The casual contact made my pulse skip. I clutched the number slip in my free hand,hyperaware of his fingers intertwined with mine.

When we sat down, he loosened his grip slightly. My palm felt strangely empty, and I couldn't help staring at the spot his hand had been, noting the slight dampness there. *Was I actually nervous enough to have sweaty palms?* Heat crept up my neck as I tried to look anywhere else.

Unfortunately, my gaze landed directly on those dark eyes of his. My heart did a complicated flip as I clutched the number slip tighter. "It's really crowded!" I managed, trying to sound casual.

"Mm." His eyes danced with barely suppressed amusement. "No rush.""Right, no rush!" I smiled weakly as he reached over to unfold my death grip on the number slip, smoothing it out with deliberate care. The way he looked at me afterward made my skin prickle with awareness. "Just two tables ahead of us." I bit my lip, certain he was teasing me on purpose. "Yeah, shouldn't be long!" True to the hostess's word, we only waited a few minutes before our turn came up. "That's us!" I jumped up, unconsciously grabbing his hand to pull him along.

One perfect eyebrow arched at my boldness, but his lips curved into that dangerous half-smile as he let me lead the way. When I finally realized what I'd done, I tried to pull back - but his grip tightened,keeping our fingers firmly intertwined.

The table was cozy - not huge, but perfect for two. I pushed the menu toward him. "See what you'd like? I forgot to ask if you can handle spicy food." The realization hit me that in all our meals at home, we'd never had anything particularly strong-flavored.

He slid the menu right back. "Don't worry about me. Order whatever you want."

My eyes lit up despite myself. "Really?"

"The place is still this busy even at this hour," I commented, looking around at the packed tables. "They must be doing something right."

"I'm sure it's goingto be tasty,June."

Heat flooded my cheeks. "You could just use my real name,you know."

"Don't you like when I call you June? It's different from what anyone else calls you." I had no response to that. *Who uses their birth month as a nickname except for my grandpa anyway?* He poured me more tea, his movements elegant even in this casual setting."About those shares your grandfather gave you - accept them without hesitation. You must know what Alexander and his father are planning." The shift in topic sobered me immediately. I nodded. "I know Grandpa must have his reasons. I just thought... 'maybe things didn't have to be so complicated."

"Capital Corp was built from nothing by your grandfather." Brandon's voice carried that gentle authority I was starting to know well. "He started with nothing,so he values the company above everything."

He paused, studying my reaction. "Victoria has fifteen percent of the shares,but she has no head for business and she's focused on her entertainment career. If she marries Alexander, who do you think those shares will really belong to?"

A bitter smile crossed my face. "I know. That's why Alexander..."I swallowed hard. "That's why he got together with Victoria behind my back.I figured it out a while ago. But my father isn't that foolish, so..."
"No, he's not foolish," Brandon's voice turned sharp. "That's why he tried to use you to secure the Windsor investment instead."

I must have paled because his expression immediately softened."I apologize, I shouldn't have-"
"It's fine," I cut him off, though my attempt at a smile felt brittle. "You're just stating facts. Capital Corp isn't as prestigious as it seems anymore.I just... I never thought my father would go that far. I always thought it was just my mother favoring Victoria because she's more...charming." Brandon's hand found mine across the table, his touch unexpectedly gentle.The warmth of his skín against mine felt like an anchor, keeping me from drowning in bitter memories.
###Chapter 54: Dating Like A Normal Couple


**Summer's POV**

Brandon's fingers threaded through mine across the restaurant table, the unexpected intimacy making my breath catch. I ducked my head,suddenly finding the elegant tablecloth fascinating. My heart was racing so fast I was sure he could hear it, even over the gentle restaurant ambiance.

What do I say? What do I do? My mind went completely blank under the weight of his intense gaze. Just when I thought I might spontaneously combust from embarrassment, the waiter appeared with our first course.

"Your appetizers," the waiter's professional voice broke through the charged moment. I'd never been so grateful for an interruption in my life.
Brandon's hand reluctantly released mine as the dishes were arranged before us. He began transferring food to my plate with precise movements,that casual authority back in his bearing.

"I can do it myself," I protested weakly, but he continued as if he hadn't heard.

"Brandon..." I reached for my plate, our fingers brushing briefly. The contact sent another jolt through my system, reminding me of how natural his touch had felt moments ago. "Really, I can handle it!"

The corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile that never failed to make my pulse skip. "Eat." The word carried that gentle command that was becoming frustratingly familiar. I found myself studying him as we ate,noting how he barely touched the heavily seasoned dishes, preferring the simpler preparations.*He likes his food clean and light,* I realized, mentally filing away the observation. Not that I was planning to cook for him or anything. Though his kitchen was really nice... After dinner, we found ourselves walking through an upscale shopping mall. The weekend crowd had thinned out, but couples still dotted the polished corridors. A young pair ahead of us caught my attention-the girl was clearly upset about something.

"You fell asleep!" Her voice carried clearly through the quiet space. "You promised to watch the movie with me!"
Her boyfriend's defensive tone made me hide a smile. "Come on, it's not my fault! You girls always want to watch these romantic dramas full of misunderstandings. Real life isn't like that!"
"But that's the point!" She huffed. "Art is supposed to be elevated from real life! You promised to watch it with me!"
I couldn't help the small laugh that escaped once they were out of earshot."Pfft..."

Brandon glanced at me, one perfect eyebrow raised. "Something funny?"

I shook my head, still smiling. "Girls aren't actually that complicated,you know? She just wanted him to spend time with her. The movie itself doesn't matter - it's about the companionship. As long as he's not completely checked out..."

Something flickered across Brandon's face as he checked his watch. "It's still early. Let's watch a movie."

"What?" I stared at him, sure I'd misheard. "You... want to watch a movie? Before I could form a coherent response, he was already on his phone."James, Get us two tickets." He scanned the movie posters with casual disinterest. "Hmm, 'Like You' will do.""Like You'?" I couldn't keep the disbelief from my voice. *The romantic drama that's been all over social media?* "Are you serious?"
"Why are you looking at me like that?" The amusement in his tone made my cheeks flush.
"You really want to watch this kind of movie?" I twisted my fingers nervously. "You don't have to humor me..."
His hand found mine, fingers intertwining with casual possessiveness. "Didn't you just say girls need companionship?" That dangerous half-smile played at his lips. "If that applies to dating couples, shouldn't it apply even more to married ones?"

The warmth of his hand against mine made it hard to think straight. We made our way to the ticket counter, where a small crowd had gathered around the self-service machines.
"Could you hurry up?" Someone called from behind us, impatience clear in their voice.

"Sorry!" I apologized quickly, then noticed Brandon's hesitation with the touch screen. *No way...* I leaned closer, trying to hide my grin. "Don't tell me you don't know how to use the self-service kiosk?"

The look he gave me could have frozen hell itself. "Here," I bit back a laugh as I took his phone, quickly navigating the interface. His glare promised retribution, but I couldn't help finding it oddly endearing that the mighty Brandon Stark had been stymied by a movie ticket machine. He pulled me away from the crowd, his grip on my hand firm but gentle."June," "Hmm?" I looked up, caught off guard by the intensity in his expression."I know we're married," his voice dropped lower, sending shivers down my spine, "but l also know you're still adjusting to us. To this."

Guilt twisted in my stomach. "I'm sorry, it's my fault-"

"No." He cut me off smoothly. "It's not your fault at all." He bent slightly,bringing himself to my eye level. The move should have felt condescending.but something in his expression made my breath catch instead. "We can start from the beginning."

"What do you mean?"

His fingers threaded through mine, the gesture somehow both possessive and tender. "Dating. We'll do what other couples do. Take it step by step."
"Are you sure?" I searched his face for any sign of mockery,but found only that steady intensity that seemed to be his default state.

His free hand came up to brush my cheek, the touch feather-light."Absolutely sure. No pressure, June. We'll take it at your pace." His thumb traced my lower lip, making my pulse race. "Though you should stop looking at me like that, or I might have to kiss you."

"Stop teasing!" I ducked my head, but couldn't quite hide my smile.

"As you wish." He squeezed my hand gently. "Let's get some snacks before the movie starts." Despite my protests, Brandon returned with a large popcorn and two drinks. "Shh," he pressed a finger to his lips as thè lights began to dim."Movie's starting."Finding our seats in the darkness proved interesting. Brandon helped me with my bag, passing me a drink with careful precision. "Thirsty?" I shook my head but took a sip anyway, hyperaware of his presence beside me. The theater was full of young couples, reminding me of my own college days.
Hlis fingers tightened around mine as the movie began. The romantic plot unfolded on screen - a classic tale of misunderstandings and eventual reconciliation between a powerful CEO and his employee.
"Brandon," I whispered, trying to pull my hand free. "What are you doing?11

"Watching a mnovie." His voice carried that velvet-soft quality that never failed to make my skin prickle. His thumb continued its maddening path across my palm.
"Let go..." But even to my own ears, the protest sounded weak.

He leaned closer, his breath warm against my ear. "Stay still."

My heart clenched as the movie reached a particularly intimate scene between the leads. Just then, Brandon's grip on my hand tightened slightly.He guided my hand to rest on his thigh, his fingers still intertwined with mine. Tapping my fingertips gently, he leaned close and murmured, "June.do you all really like these kinds of movies? The domineering CEO type?"
"I am not!" I yelled, but my face felt like it was on fire.*Though the CEO in the movie wasn't half asintimidating as the real thing sitting next to me.*
###Chapter 55: He's Jealous

**Summer's POV**

After I yelled, several heads turned in our direction, curiosity evident in their expressions even in thedim light. I wanted to sink into my plush seat and disappear, but Brandon seemed completely unfazed by the attention.

My embarrassment was getting unbearable. "Let go," I whispered, trying to pull my hand free. "My palm is all sweaty."
"Is it?" His deep voice carried that dangerous edge of amusement. He shifted his grip slightly buIt showed no intention of releasing me.
"How am I supposed to eat popcorn like this?" I tried again,gesturing at the large bucket balanced precariously on the armrest between us.
Without missing a beat, Brandon reached over with his free hand, picked up a piece of popcorn, and held it to my lips. The casual intimacy of the gesture made my heart skip several beats. *Is this really happening?Brandon Stark, the most feared CEO on Wall Street, is actually...*

"Eat." he murmured, his deep voice carrying that velvet-soft quality that never failed to make my skin prickle. Even in the darkness of the theater,his voice seemed to wrap around me like silk - richer and more compelling than even the movie's leading man. How does he make even a simple word sound so... intense? I stared at him in disbelief, grateful for the darkness hiding my flaming cheeks. He met my gaze steadily, that infuriating half-smile playing at his lips as he waited. After what felt like an eternity but was probably only seconds, I gave in, accepting the offered popcorn."Want more?* The amusement in his tone was unmistakable. "I can feed myself!" I protested weakly.

He passed me a drink instead. "Don't havetoo much."

I found myself automatically following his instruction before realizing what I was doing. *When did this dynamic become so... natural?*
Behind us, a female voice carried clearly through the quiet theater: "Look at how sweet they are! He even feeds her popcorn. Meanwhile, you're just glued to your phone!"
"If other boyfriends are so great, why don't you go date them instead?"Her companion shot back, clearly annoyed.
"Are they talking about us?" I whispered to Brandon, mortification making my voice crack slightly.
His dark eyes gleamed with something dangerous. "Not convincing enough as a couple? Should I feed you again to prove it?"
"That's not the point!" I hissed. "We're being used as some kind of relationship benchmark!"
Brandon's only response was to offer me another piece of popcorn,his movements impossibly elegant even in this mundane task. *How does he make everything look so effortless?* I couldn't help studying his perfect profile in the flickering light from the screen. The sharp angles of his face seemed softened somehow, though no less striking.

"So romantic!" The girl behind us sighed loudly. "Why can't we be like that?"

 "It's bad enough watching couples be lovey-dovey in the movie,"her boyfriend grumbled. "Now we have to deal with it in real lifetoo?""Why are you being so difficult today?" Shedemanded. "And you're being dramatic!" He shot back. "He can't be her real boyfriend,they're obviously putting on a show."

I turned to Brandon, unable to hide my amusement. "He thinks we're acting."
"He's jealous." Brandon's voice carried that velvet-soft quality that never failed to make my skin prickle.
Looking back at the screen, I had to admit the boy wasn't entirely wrong.We weren't a normal couple - we'd literally gotten married before dating.The thought should have been unsettling, but somehow, sitting here in the dark with Brandon's hand warm around mine, it just felt..right.
The rest of the movie passed in a blur of stolen glances and shared popcorn. By the time the lights came up, my cheeks hurt from smiling.
"This is all your fault," I complained as we left the theater. "You kept feeding me popcorn!"

"I thought you enjoyed it." His dark eyes danced with barely suppressed mischief.

"Brandon Stark!" I tried to sound stern despite the warmth blooming in my chest. "You're impossible!"
His fingers threaded through mine as we made our way into the mall."Speaking of impossible... your car is still at Fortune Corp."
 
"Oh no,I forgot-" "James took care of it." Of course he had. Brandon never left loose ends."Want to look around?" Hle gestured at the high-end shops lining the mall's corridors."We have time." I hesitated, suddenly nervous. "What if someone sees us?" "Worried about being seen with Stark Group's CEO?" His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile. "Am I that recognizable?"
"You know what I mean!" But I couldn't help laughing at his mock offense. "Weren't we keeping this private for now?"

He pulled me closer, his cologne wrapping around me like a familiar blanket. "This nervous about dating your husband?"
"Wait..." A thought suddenly struck me. "Isn't this mall owned by Stark Group? I remember hearing about the acquisition two years agoat Fortune Corp."
"Wondering if that's why I know the layout so well?" His dark eyes held mine with dangerous intensity.
"It's getting late," I said quickly, trying to ignore how my pulse raced under his gaze.

"Relax." His thumb traced gentle circles on my palm. "If we're starting with dating, we should do it properly." He guided me toward the upscale boutiques, his stride shortening to match my pace. "Let me take my wife shopping."

I found myself following half a step behind, hyperaware of our joined hands and the height difference that forced me to look up at him. My Louboutins clicked against the polished floor as I tried to maintain my usual grace.

"Tired?" His voice softened as he noticed my slightly uneven steps. "I'm fine!" But he'd already slowed his pace further, his hand steady and warm around mine. "June," The way he said my name made my breath catch. "You don't have to try so hard. We have all the time in the world."
###Chapter 56: Who Are You Again?

**Summer's POV**
Brandon and I made our way through the mall. My heels clicked against the floor with each step, a sound that usually made me feel confident but now just reminded me of how much my feet were killing me.
I must have winced slightly because Brandon's hand tightenedaround mine. "You're limping."
"Just these heels," I tried to smile despite the discomfort. "They're not exactly made for mall walking."
His dark eyes studied my face. "Why didn't you say something earlier?"

"It's nothing! Really." I attempted to quicken my pace to prove my point,but my ankle chose that moment to wobble traitorously. Brandon's arm shot out to steady me, his movements fluid and precise.

"Stop pretending." He said softly. "Come here."

Before I could protest, he was guiding me toward Stuart Weitzman's gleaming storefront. The luixury shoe boutique sparkled with tasteful lighting and elegant displays, making me suddenly very aware of my increasingly uncomfortable footwear.

"Brandon!" I tried to dig in my heels, which only made them hurt more."This isn't necessary. I can just change when we get home." "June." The way he said my nickname sent an involuntary shiver down my spine. "You need comfortable shoes. And when we're dating,you shouldn't have to suffer." I couldn't help the little snort that escaped. "Even buying shoes has to be 1up to Brandon Stark's standards?" His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile that never failed to make my heart race. "You still don't know me very well,do you?"
Before I could formulate a response, a sales associate materialized beside us with professional efficiency. Brandon's hand found the small of my back,guiding me forward with gentle insistence.

"Go look around." His fingers brushed my hair back from my face,the gesture so casual it made my breath catch. "Find something comfortable."

I ducked away from his touch, my cheeks burning. "Don't treat me like a child!"

"Hmm." That knowing glint in his eyes made my stomach do complicated flips.

"You'll... wait here?" I couldn't quite keep the uncertainty from my voice.

He settled into one of the plush VIP seats with that predatory grace that seemed to come naturally to him. "Of course."
The sales associate guided me through their newest collections,her professional enthusiasm never wavering. "These just arrived from our fall collection," she gestured to a display of elegant pumps. "Perfect for the office,and the lower heel height means you can wear them all day."

My attention caught on a pair of deep wine-colored heels. The design was sophisticated but not flashy, with clean lines that spoke of quality craftsmanship. *These would work for both client meetings and dinner events...* "Those would look lovely on you," the associate commented,already moving to retrieve my size. "The color really suits your complexion." "Oh my god, isn't this the pair Vogue featured last month?" A familiar voice cut through my contemplation like a knife. "They're absolutely gorgeous!"
My blood ran cold as I turned to find Victoria standing there,her perfect smile firmly in place. Anna Wilson hovered at her shoulder like a well-trained shadow, and I caught sight of Sophie lingering behind them,her expression carefully neutral.
"Summer!" Victoria's voice dripped with false warmth as she grabbed my hands. "What a coincidence! Shopping therapy?"

I pulled my hands back as casually as I could manage."With friends?"

"Yes! You remember Anna, right?" Victoria gestured to her companion,who gave me a look that could have curdled milk.
"Of course." I kept my voice professionally neutral, already planning my escape route. "Well, you all enjoyyour shopping. I have work to handle."
"Summer, wait!" Victoria said, "Are you still angry? I know Alexander and I hurt you, but that's in the past. We'll always be sisters!"

I bit back a bitter laugh. "Sisters? Is that what we are?"

"Everyone's so worried about you," she continued, her eyes wide with practiced concern. "Especially Grandpa George - his health hasn't been great lately. Even if you hate me, you should visit them."

"If you're uncomfortable seeing me," she added with masterful manipulation, "I can always make myself scarce..." "Enough." The word came out sharper than I intended. "Drop the act,Victoria. Whether I visit home or not is my business." I couldn't help the cold smile that curved my lips. "What's wrong? Feeling guilty?"

 Victoria's perfect mask cracked slightly. "How can you say that? Alexander and I are in love - your obsession won't change anything!" "She's right," Anna jumped in, her voice dripping with venom. "You need to face reality, Summer. Alexander and Victoria are perfect together.Why keep causing trouble?"


"Such loyal friends." I couldn't quite keep the bitterness from my voice.

"Of course we're loyal!" Anna's eyes narrowed dangerously. "That's why we have to tell you the truth. You're Victoria's sister, so we've tried to be nice, but you're being so ungrateful! If Victoria hadn't saved your life back then...".


"Don't." I cut her off, ice crystallizing in my veins. "Don't you dare bring up ancient history."

I turned to Victoria,letting her see the steel in my eyes. "Let me be clear.
You live your life, I'll live mine. We don't need to pretend anymore."

"As for Alexander," I continued, proud of how steady my voice remained,"since you want him so badly, treasure him. I never look back once I've decided to let go."

"Summer!" Victoria's voice cracked with genuine emotion.

"Don't bother arguing with her!" Anna cut in. "Look at her attitude! You treat her like a real sister, but she clearly doesn't see you the same way!"

"Your friend's right." I smiled, though it felt more like baring teeth. "From the moment you betrayed me, I stopped considering you my sister.Let's just be strangers from now on." "See?" Anna's voice rose triumphantly.′′Itold you you're too soft,Victoria!Give people an inch and they'll take a mile!" "Anna, don't..." Victoria's voice wavered perfectly. "She's still my only sister..." "Mr. Stark?" Victoria's voice suddenly shifted to something breathless with surprise.

My heart nearly stopped as I turned to find Brandon approaching. My own panic must have shown on my face because Brandon's hand found mine, his touch grounding me even as my mind raced. *We can't let Victoria know about us. Not yet.*

His thumb traced a gentle circle on my palm, and I forced myself to breathe. Brandon's presence beside me felt like a shield, his quiet strength holding me steady.

"Do I know you?" His deepvoice carried just a hint of arctic chill.

Victoria's perfect smile faltered slightly. "Mr. Stark, don't you remember? I'm Victoria Taylor, Alexander's fiancée. At Grandpa George's birthday party,you gave that beautiful chess set..."

"Ah." Brandon's expression could have frozen hell itself. "Vaguely recall something like that." His dark eyes swept over her dismissively. "Who are you again?"

I caught Sophie hiding a smile behind her hand, her sharp eyes missing nothing as Victoria's perfect mask cracked just a little more.
###Chapter 57: Put on A Play

**Summer's POV**

Victoria glided forward with practiced grace, her perfect smile firmly in place. "You must be very busy, Mr. Stark. That day at the party,there were so many people - you probably don't remember me. Let me introduce myself: I'm Victoria Taylor, daughter of the Taylor family and Alexander Stark's fiancée." She emphasized each title like she was reading from a particularly impressive resume.

Brandon's dark eyes swept over her with deliberate slowness and let go of my hand, his expression unreadable as he studied her. His lips curved into a slight smile that held no warmth. "The Taylor family... I remember." He paused, his eyes narrowing slightly. "But Alexander Stark? Who might that be?"

I watched Victoria's perfect smile freeze for just a fraction of a second. The temperature in the store seemed to drop several degrees. The awkwardness was palpable. *God, he's really going to pretend he doesn't know who Alexander is,* I thought, watching my sister's composure crack just slightly around the edges.

"Miss Taylor is looking at shoes?"

Victoria recovered quickly, but I could see the tension in her shoulders as she forced a light laugh. "Oh, I'm just here shopping with friends! Are you here to shop as well,Mr.Stark?" If Brandon noticed the strain in her voice, he gave no sign. Instead, his gaze found mine with unerring accuracy. It took me a moment to realize he was addressing me. "Are you asking me, Mr. Stark?" "Who else?" The amusement in his tone made my pulse skip despite myself.13 I caught Victoria's expression darkening from the corner of my eye."Yes,just looking for some flats."

The saleswoman who'd been hovering nearby practically materialized at my elbow. "What size would you like, miss?"

"Seven, please." I kept my voice steady despite how my heart raced under Brandon's intense scrutiny.

"Mr. Stark, are you shopping too?" I asked, desperate to break the charged silence that had fallen.

His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile. "Summer Taylor remembers me?"

"How could I forget?" The words came out softer than intended. "You made my grandfather so happy that day,playing chess with him."

"George Taylor is a respected elder." His dark eyes held mine with an intensity that made my skin prickle. "His opinion matters greatly.That pen was a good gift too. You have a good taste, Miss Taylor."

Before I could respond, Anna stepped forward with the kind of confidence that came from years of elite finishing schools. "Mr. Stark, I'm Anna Watson,Joe Watson's Sister." Brandon barely spared her a glance, just a slight nod before his attention returned to me. Anna's perfect smile froze, uncertainty flickering across her features as Brandon continued to ignore her. She and Sophie exchanged glances - they'd been captivated by Brandon's striking appearance at first, drawn in by his obvious wealth and power. But now they were learning the hard way that Brandon Stark played by his own rules. I found myself raising an eyebrow, unsure whether to smile or not.Brandon was complimenting me, sure, but wasn't he really just showing

 off his own power? The way he'd orchestrated this whole scene... I hadn't expected him to actually stick around and play this game with Victoria.

I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel good though. I admitted to myself. Being treated like this by Brandon Stark, having him so obviously choose me over everyone else-what woman wouldn't enjoy that kind of attention?

Victoría's face was a study in barely contained rage. I could practically read her thoughts: Why Summer? What makes her so special that Brandon Stark would remember her? Her perfect composure cracked further as she watched our interaction. We both met him for the first time at Grandpa's party, but he barely noticed me then. So why is he paying attention to Summer now?

"Miss, your flats are ready!" The saleswoman's voice cut through the tension. "Size seven - would you like to try them on?"

"Mr. Stark, I should..." I gestured vaguely toward the fitting area.

He nodded slightly. "Ġo ahead."

Victoria seized her chance the moment I moved away. "Mr. Stark, what do you think of these heels? They're quite-"

"Box these up." Brandon cut her off smoothly, gesturing to a pair of elegant heels. "Size seven."

My heart did a complicated flip.*Is he...*

"Miss Taylor, would you do me a favor?" His deep voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse race. "Of course, as long as Mr. Stark doesn't mind!" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. Victoria's voice turned sharp. "Hey! Box up those heels for me-Iwear a seven too, no need to try them on!"

The saleswoman shifted uncomfortably. "I'm sorry, miss, but we only have one pair in that size."
"Mr. Stark hasn't purchased them, right? Now I'm going to buy them!"Victoria's perfect composure cracked slightly. "Here's my card! What are you waiting for?"
"I apologize, miss, but Mr. Stark doesn't need to pay with a card. The shoes are his."

Victoria's face twisted with fury. "Do you know who I am? Do you want to stay in business in Manhattan? I could have this storeshut down with one phone call!"

The silence that fell was deafening. Victoria stood there, chest heaving,her usual poise completely shattered. Anna and Sophie exchanged worried glances,clearly unsure how to handle this new development.

Brandon's expression hadn't changed, but something in his bearing made the temperature in the room drop several degrees. The saleswoman straightened her spine, years of professional training evident in her polite but firm tone: "I apologize, miss, but the shoes belong to Mr. Stark."
###Chapter 58: Teaching Victoria a Lesson


**Summer's POV**

The sales associate's professional voice cut through the tension like a knife."I apologize, Miss Taylor, but there seems to be a misunderstanding.These shoes were already selected by Mr. Stark. And since you haven't made a payment yet, it's only fair that we prioritize Mr. Stark's request. Here at Stuart Weitzman, we treat all our customers equally, even if they are from the Taylor family."

The associate's gaze remained steady, never wavering as she met Victoria's increasingly hostile glare. I caught the subtle curl of her lips, the slightest hint of satisfaction in putting an enatitled customer in her place. My sister's face flushed with barely contained rage.

"Mr. Stark," I ventured cautiously, "should I try them on?"

Brandon's dark eyes found mine with unerring accuracy. "If you would,Miss Taylor."

"Let's just forget aboutit," I said softly, trying to defuse the situation before it could escalate further. The last thing I needed was Victoria making an even bigger scene. "There's no need to-"

"Please try them on," Brandon cut me off smoothly, his voice carrying that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse skip. Victoria's voice shook with fury. "You..." She seemed to choke on her own anger for a moment before recovering her usual haughty tone. "Get your manager. No, get your regional director. I want to see who dares treat me like this in Manhattan!" The sales associate's smile never wavered, though a knowing glint appeared in her eyes as she glanced at Brandon, "Of course, I'll fetch our manager right away. Please wait a moment." Brandon turned to me, his expression softening imperceptibly. "Is something wrong?"
Watching Victoria seethe, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of anxiety. My sister had never been good at handling public humiliation. "Mr. Stark,really,it's not necessary to-"
"Try them on, June." His voice dropped lower, sending an involuntary shiver down my spine.

The moment I settled onto the plush leather seat, Brandon's presence seemed to fill the entire store. His movements were precise and elegant as he watched me slip off my uncomfortable heels. The new shoes fit perfectly - *of course they did* - but as I stood to test them, my ankle wobbled traitorously.
Brandon's hand shot out to steady me, one arm wrapping around my waist while the other caught my elbow. The contact sent electricity dancing across my skin, and I found myself clutching his shoulder for balance.

"Shameless!" Anna's voice dripped with venom. "Throwing yourself at any man who shows interest. I guess old habits die hard!"
Heat flooded my cheeks as I quickly pushed away from Brandon's support."Thank you," I managed, my voice barely above a whisper. But even as I tried to create distance between us, I could feel the lingering warmth of his touch. His dark eyes studied my face with dangerous intensity, a muscle ticking in his jaw at Anna's comment. "Are you alright?"Before I could respond, hurried footsteps announced the manager's arrival.The moment he caught sight of Brandon, his eyes widened with recognition, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. "Mr. Brandon Stark!" The manager's voice carried equal parts surprise and deference. "I didn't realize you were visiting personally!"

I caught Anna and Sophie's frantic whispers:

"Why didn't you tell me he was *the* Brandon Stark?"


"I told you he was a Stark!"
"You idiot! You made us call for the manager! Do you even know who Brandon Stark is?"

"He's just from the Stark family, right?"

"You have no idea what you've done!"

"You must be joking!" Sophie's voice rose slightly in panic. "Taylor family or not, Alexander is your fiancé - how can you not know about the Stark family hierarchy?"

The manager's professional smile never wavered as he turned to Victoria."What seems to be the problem,miss?"
Victoria drew herself up, her chin lifting defiantly despite how her hands trembled slightly. "I want to buy those shoes, and your staff is refusing to sell them to me! Do you know who I am? I have more than enough money, yet you won't let me make a purchase - what kind of service is this? And your sales associate's attitude is completely unprofessional!" "Actually," the associate cut in smoothly, a slight smile playing at her lips, "I was just explaining the situation. Mr. Stark doesn't need to pay-anything he selects is automatically his. Though it's understandable this young lady wouldn't know, since Mr. Stark owns this entire shopping complex. If he wanted every item in the mall, they would all be complimentary." The manager nodded sagely. "The situation seems clear -just a simple misunderstanding. It's perfectly natural that this young lady wouldn't recognize our owner. Very few people have the privilege of knowing Mr.Stark personally. Since these particular shoes are spoken for, perhaps we could show you1 some other styles?"
I watched understanding dawn in Victoria's eyes. The realization that nearly every high-end retail space in Manhattan operated under Stark Group's umbrella seemed to hit her like a physical blow.
Sophie-tugged urgently at Victoria's sleeve, her expression tight with concern. "Remember who you are - you're a movie star. Think about the paparazzi! We need to leave before this gets worse."
Throughout the entire exchange, Brandon maintained his elegant bearing,his attention focused solely on me as if the others didn't exist. The weight of his gaze made my skin prickle with awareness, and I couldn't help wondering if he'd orchestrated this entire scene.
Brandon's only response was to reach for my hand, his touch sending warmth spreading through my chest despite my concerns. The gesture felt oddly protective, even as it marked me as definitively his in front of everyone present.

Victoria's face had gone through an impressive array of emotions - from shock to understanding to a kind of horrified realization. Her perfect facade had crumbled completely, revealing the ugly truth beneath:the mighty Taylor family, for all its prestige, was nothing compared to the power Brandon Stark could wield with a single word.As Sophie practically dragged Victoria toward the exit, I caught my sister's expression in the store's mirrors - a complex mix of humiliation,rage,and something that looked unsettlingly like calculation."She's going to hate me even more now," I couldn't help murmuring. "She'll hate you anyway." One of Brandon's finger traced along my jawline,the touch so light I might have imagined it if not for the electricity it sent dancing across my skin.

"You don't understand. Victoria isn't someone who just lets things go...She'll find a way to make me pay for this humiliation."
###Chapter 59: Are You Afraid She'll Take Me Away?
**Summer's POV**

"Is that what you're worried about?" His dark eyes studied my face with dangerous focus, catching every micro-expression I tried to hide. "Sounds like you've had plenty of experience being her target. And you're so used to playing defense, aren't you, June?"
The observation was casual, but something in his tone made me look up.

"Isn't that obvious? I moved out of the Taylor mansion the moment I could afford my own place. I only go back for things like Grandpa George s birthday, when absence would cause more drama than presence."
His dark eyes studied my face, taking in every subtle tell I couldn't quite hide. My fingers twisted nervously in the hem of my blouse as that penetrating gaze seemed to strip away every defense I'd built over the years.

"She's quite skilled at manipulation," he concluded, his voice carrying an edge that made me shiver. His thumb brushed across my knuckles,stilling my fidgeting hands. "But she's never faced someone like me before."

"Brandon..." I said, "You don't have to get involved in Taylor family drama. Victoria has this way of making everything so much worse than it needs to be."The sales saleswoman approached with perfectly wrapped boxes,her professional demeanor never wavering. The store manager followed close behind,practically radiating deference. "Mr. Stark, the shoes..." The manager's voice carried just the right note of respect.
Brandon's brow furrowed slightly as he accepted the box containing the heels. "And the flats?"

"Right here, Miss Taylor." The saleswoman produced another box with impressive efficiency. "Your size, as requested."
I glanced at Brandon, suddenly uncertain. He nodded once, his expression softening imperceptibly. "Try them on. And wear less heels from now on."A smile played at his lips as he added, "Except at home."
Heat flooded my cheeks as I caught his meaning, understanding dawning as I watched the manager's careful orchestration of the entire scene. The height difference between us was even more pronounced now- my 5'6" to his 6'2"- but something about it felt oddly right.
"Thank you," I said to the saleswoman as she packed up my old shoes.Then, to Brandon: "Shall we go?"



"Thank you for helping me today." I turned to face him once we reached the mall's main corridor. Without those heels digging into my feet, walking felt like floating.

The corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile."Is that all?"

"What else do you want?" I couldn't quite hide my own answering smile. "No wonder you're no match for her." He closed the distance between us in two long strides, taking the shopping bag from my hand and naturally intertwining our fingers.My body went rigid, face flaming as I registered the casual intimacy of the gesture. "There are people everywhere!" I tried to pull away, though not very convincingly. My eyes darted around nervously,hyper-aware of potential observers.
"Am I embarrassing you?" The amusement in his voice made my pulse race.
"No!" I forced an awkward laugh. "I just... what if Victoria's still around?If she sees us together..."

"What is there to be afraidof?" He cut me off smoothly, something like disdain coloring his tone. "I didn't expect you to be so wary of your sister.She's all bluster."
The words hit harder than they should have. I bit my lip, memories of twenty-plus years of sisterhood washing over me like acid. "You don't understand. It started with small things - toys, clothes. Then it was friends.Then our parents' affection. Victoria... she doesn't just take things. She makes sure you know they were taken."
"Are you afraid she'll try to take me away too?" Brandon's deep voice carried a hint of amusement, though something darker lurked beneath.
I froze, caught completely off guard by his question. "What? No,why would you think that?" The denial came automatically, but when I caught sight of his slightly darkening expression, I realized I might have given the wrong answer. I let out an awkward laugh, trying to backtrack. "I mean... that's not what I meant. I know Victoria couldn't take you away - I know what kind of person you are." My voice softened as I continued, "But you don't really understand my family. They always find new ways to surprise me with how low they can go. If Victoria finds out about us, about our marriage...well, if she can't have the best, she'll try to destroy everything around it." "You think she can destroy me?" Brandon's low laugh held a dangerous edge, though his mood seemed to lighten at my fumbling explanation."Don't worry. Your husband isn't so easily broken."
"Oh. I know she doesn't have that kind of power," I said quickly,remembering exactly who I was talking to. "But she'll keep pushing and pushing, until it becomes so annoying you'll get sick of dealing with it all.And if my father finds out about our relationship..." I trailed off,remembering how quickly Richard Taylor had been willing to sacrifice his own daughter for business interests.
"I'm serious," I said softly, letting all my fears spill out. "My father was willing to sacrifice me for a two hundred million dollar investment. The Taylor family... I don't want them causing trouble for you."

A low chuckle escaped him. "Silly girl."

"This isn't funny!" I protested, but his gentle squeeze of my fingers made the words lose their edge.

"I'm not mocking you," Brandon said softly. "Since I chose to marry you, I've considered all of this. We're husband and wife now -shouldn't we face everything together, share both the good and bad?" His voice deepened with conviction. "If I were so easily manipulated, I wouldn't be Brandon Stark. Trust me to handle these matters." Seeing my still-uncertain expression, he reached out to stroke my hair again. I ducked away with a pout. "Do you have some kind of compulsive need to pat my head? You're messing up my hair." I leaned against the window, watching the buildings blur past. "Sometimes I just wish life could be simpler, you know?" Brandon's eyebrow arched slightly, a smile tugging at his lips. The sudden buzz of his phone interrupted whatever he'd been about to say."Get that for me?" I picked up his phone, checking the screen. "It's James."


"Put it on speaker."
"Okay." I turned on the speakerphone, and James's crisp voice filled the car. "Sir, we have an update."
I glanced uncertainly at Brandon. "Should I turn off the speaker?" But Brandon just shook his head. "Go ahead, James."

"The investigation is moving forward, but there's something else." James hesitated for a moment. "I just received a video. It's about your wife."
I looked at Brandon in confusion, mouthing "Me?" His expression darkened slightly.

"Continue," Brandon commanded.

James cleared his throat, his usual efficiency tinged with uncertainty.His hesitation made my stomach twist with anxiety. I gripped the phone tighter, and Brandon must have noticed my tension because his eyes narrowed slightly,giving me a reassuring look.

I forced a small smile, trying to show I was fine. "James, it's Summer. You said there's a video about me? Just tell us."

"Yes, ma'am. It's... it's footage from your grandfather's birthday party.What happened upstairs that night." The phone slipped from my suddenly numb fingers, hitting the console with a sharp crack. My hands trembled as I scrambled to pick it up. "What video? I was unconscious upstairs - who could have taken a video?"
###Chapter 60: Racing

**Summer's POV**
Brandon's hand found mine in the darkness, his touch surprisingly gentle despite the tension radiating from him. "Send it," he ordered, his voice carrying enough ice to freeze hell itself. "Now."

The video arrived seconds later, its timestamp showing less than a minute of footage. My heart hammered against my ribs as Brandon pulled over to the shoulder of the road, the Bentley's engine purring softly in the night air.

"You don't have to watch this," Brandon said quietly, but I shook my head.


"I need to know." My voice came out steadier than I felt.

The video was brief but crystal clear, a close-up shot from what must have been a phone camera. I watched myself writhing on the bed, my movements clearly influenced by whatever they'd put in that tea. My face was flushed, my expressions unguarded. The intimate angle of the footage made my stomach turn.

"It was Charles Windsor," I whispered, my voice shaking. "It had to be.There was no one else in that room except..." I couldn't finish the sentence.My own family had drugged me and left me there with him.

"But why?" I coudn't keep my voice from shaking. "He was filming me.Why would James have it?" Brandon's thumb traced gentle circles on my palm, the gesture at odds with the dangerous glint in his eyes. "Because I have James monitoring all communication between the Windsors andI your family." His dark eyes found mine in the dim light. "What?" The word came out as barely a whisper. "Maybe this was a threat."

"Threatening my parents?" The words tasted like ashes in my mouth."What do we do now?"
Brandon's free hand came up to brush my cheek, the touch feather-light."June. Look at me."

I turned, caught off guard by the intensity in his expression.

"They can't touch you anymore." His voice dropped lower, sending shivers down my spine. "You're mine now. My wife. Let them try their pathetic schemes -I'll show them what real power looks like."
Something warm unfurled in my chest at his words. The possessive note in his voice should have frightened me, but instead it felt like armor-protection against everything my family had tried to do.
Suddenly, Brandon shifted gears, guiding the Bentley back onto the empty highway. "Want to try?"

"Try what?"

That dangerous half-smile played at his lips. "Want to try racing?"


"Racing?" I stared at himn in disbelief. "Now? With what car?"

His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile as he started unbuckling his seatbelt. "Who said I was the one racing?" "Wait..." I pointed at myself in shock. "You want me to race? No, no, I can't! I only have a basic license- I can barely drive normally, let alone race!And this isn't even a proper racing car!""I'm not scared!" The denial came automatically. "Just... this is a very expensive car" "June, don't be afraid." He reached over and squeezed my hand reassuringly. "Some things you need to try before you know your limits.I wasn't always good at racing either."
His gentle voice washed over me like a spell, drawing me in despite my fears. I blinked at him uncertainly. "But I don't know..."

"When I'm feeling down, I like to race," he continued softly. "Pushing your limits, feeling that speed - it makes you forget everything else. Want to try?".

"Okay," I heard myself say.

The driver's seat felt different- more intimidating somehow, with all those controls and that perfectly polished dashboard. Brandon settled into the passenger seat like a king on his throne, watching with barely concealed amusement as I adjusted everything to my height.

"Nervous?" His voice carried just a hint of teasing.

"Shut up." I gripped the steering wheel, trying to remember everything I knew about driving luxury cars. Which was basically nothing. "If I wreck this..."

"You won't." His confidence made something warm flutter in my stomach."Trust yourself.June." The engine purred to life under my touch, responding to the slightest pressure on the pedal. We cruised through the empty streets, the city lights blurring past like stars. Despite my initial nerves, the Bentley handled like a dream -smooth and powerful and impossibly responsive. I couldn't help but press down harder on the accelerator, feeling the thrill as the speed increased. The empty road stretched before us like an invitation. Brandon sat quietly beside me, his presence giving me a strength I didn't know I possessed.  "Brandon, I feel like I'm flying!" I exclaimed, gripping the steering wheel tighter. "The car and me together, we're flying!"
"Mm." His approval was subtle but clear. He reached over and lowered both windows,letting the rushing wind fill the car. The cold air stung my cheeks, but I couldn't stop grinning.
Suddenly, a modified sports car shot past us, followed by several others.My competitive spirit flared unexpectedly. I glanced at Brandon.
He raised an eyebrow, looking pleased at this turn of events.

"There's a gathering up ahead," Brandon said suddenly, gesturing to a cluster of headlights in the distance. "Interested?"
As we got closer, I could make out several modified sports cars arranged in a loose semicircle. The smell of burning rubber and high-octane fuel filled the air, mixing with the thunderous sound of revving engines.
"Is this... are they actually racing?" My heart rate picked up despite myself.

A figure approached our car, whistling appreciatively at the Bentley's sleek lines. "Well, well! What do we have here? Bentley's not exactly street racing material, but..." He grinned, leaning against my window. "Want to try your luck,beautiful?"

I should have been intimidated. Should have politely declined and driven away. But something about having Brandon beside me, about the way he looked at me lie I could do anything... I turned to Brandon, expecting him to shut this down immediately.Instead, those dark eyes studied my face with dangerous intensity.′′YOur choice,June." I unbuckled my seatbelt. "Brandon, I think for the sake of your reputation., "Hmm?" He raised an eyebrow.clearly amused.

"I mean, your car might look understated, but that license plate is impossible to miss," I gestured at the pristine Bentley. "If I lose today and these people look up your car... Wall Street's most powerful CEO participating in illegal racing? Your reputation would be ruined!"
###Chapter 61:Kiss

**Summer's POV**
"Is that really your only concern?" His voice carried that velvet-soft quality that never failed to make my pulse race.
Heat flooded my cheeks as I finally admitted, "Okay, fine! I'm worried I'll lose,alright? Happy now? We should switch places!"
His smile widened slightly. "Come on then." Without another word,he stepped out of the cár, leaving me to scramble after him.
The group of modified car enthusiasts watched with barely concealed skepticism as Brandon approached. Their vehicles formed an impressive lineup - GTRs, Supras, and other heavily modified machines that made the Bentley look almost tame in comparison.

"Rules?" Brandon asked simply.

They exchanged uncertain glances, clearly thrown by the sight of a Bentley owner actually willing to race. The leader, a tall guy with facial piercings,recovered first. "Standard route - straight down the coast to the end.Though uh, with that ride..." He gestúred at the luxury car. "We could handicap it if you want?"
A redhead with a heavily modified GTR stepped forward, grinning."Or just beat one of us! That'l count as a win, yeah? No need to smoke the whole field with that fancy ride." "Deal." I couldn't help chiming in. "Just one car, right?" Brandon's sidelong glance made me step back automatically, fighting a guilty smile. As everyone moved to their cars, I caught fragments of whispered conversation between the racers: "Boss, that plate number..."

"Shut up and get in your car!"
"Don't mess this up - if we let a Bentley pass us, we'll never live it down..."1

"Give me the clean channel on the radio..."

The leader's voice cut through the chatter: "Everyone clear on the rules?And hey,careful on that last curve."
Brandon buckled his seatbelt with practiced efficiency, then turned to me. "Ready for this speed?"
I thought about how the car had felt under my control earlier and nodded.trying to project more confidence than I felt. "I think so."

"Hold on tight."
The moment Brandon hit the accelerator, I knew I'd made the right choice letting him drive. The Bentley surged forward with impossible grace, the engine's purr deepening to a satisfied growl. Within seconds. we'd passed two modified cars on the first curve, the movement so smooth I barely felt it. My fingers dug into the leather armrest as I stared at Brandon's profile,mesmerized by his absolute focus.
"Oh my god!" A voice crackled through someone's radio. "Who is this guy?The way he took that curve..." "Were you a professional racer?" I couldn't help asking, watching in awe as he navigated another bend with perfect precision. That dangerous half-smile played at his lips."Scared?" "No! I'll be quiet - you focus on driving!" Still, I couldn't tear my eyes away from his hands on the wheel, the way he seemed to anticipate each turn before it came.
We flew past another car, the night air whipping through the open windows. The coastal road stretched before us like a ribbon of silver in the moonlight. "Just keeping ahead of one car is enough!" I reminded him, but Brandon just hummed noncommittally.
"Not a racer," he finally said, smoothly dodging another challenger. "Just a college hobby."
*Of course.* I fought back a smile. *Brandon Stark,casually mentioning street racing was his "college hobby" like it was intramural soccer or something.*
A yellow GTR suddenly roared past us, its driver calling out, "Sorry man!"through his open window. The car cut in front of us aggressively, clearly trying to force us to slow down.

Brandon said nothing, just smoothly accelerated. His movements were so precise, so controlled - within moments the GTR was nothing but taillights behind us. As we approached the steepest coastal curve, the one the leader had warned about, he suddenly spoke. "Talk to me."

"What?" I turned to him, startled.

"Anything. Just talk," his lips curved into that dangerous smile. "Don't forget why we came racing in the first place."

I frowned slightly,sudIdenly remembering that we'd gone racing because of my dark mood. "DDid you really have to bring that up now?" "It needs to be addressed eventually," Brandon maintained a steady pace,keeping the car ahead of us in sight while ensuring none behind could pass. He seemed completely at ease as he chatted with me. "Feeling better?" "No," I said playfully. "But I might feel better if you passed everyone.Though that's probably impossible!"
"Is that so?" Brandon's smile deepened as he glanced at me. "Well, if my wife expects such things of me, I can hardly disappoint. Hold tight."
In an instant, he shot past several cars on the next curve,leaving them far behind in what felt like mere seconds.

I stared at Brandon in amazement, then turned to look back at the shrinking taillights behind us. "How did you--"
Before I could finish my question, Brandon's expression sharpened. "Hold on tight." With that warning, he floored the accelerator,sending us flying down the most treacherous part of the road.
"Shit!" The redhead leader's voice crackled over the radio. "Is he trying to get himself killed?"
Most racers would slow down on this section, but Brandon was actually accelerating. I gripped the handle above the door so hard my knuckles turned white, my entire body rigid with tension.
My heart was in my throat- in that moment, all I could do was trust Brandon completely.
Then, to my utter surprise, the car came to a stop. I turned to Brandon,confused."What's wrong?" Brandon killed the engine and closed the windows, then reached for me."Were you afraid?" His arms wrapped around me, pulling me close against his chest. I swallowed hard, my hands coming up to rest on his biceps. My body was still trembling slightly from the adrenaline, but I tried to sound brave."N-not at all." His low chuckle vibrated through his chest as he held me tighter,one hand coming up to stroke my hair. "Very brave," he murmured, the praise making something warm unfurl in my chest.
I took a deep breath. When I'd calmed down enough to pull back slightly,I found myself staring at his perfect features in the dim light. The way the moonlight caught his sharp jawline, the intensity in those dark eyes as they studied my face.
Before I could overthink it. I leaned up and pressed a soft kiss to the corner of his mouth.
Brandon's arm snaked around my waist, pulling me closer as he deepened the kiss. I started to retreat, suddenly overwhelmed by the intensity,but his hand came up to cradle the back of my head,holding me in place with gentle firmness.
Gradually, I found myself winding my arms around his neck, responding with growing enthusiasm. The tension of the evening, the thrill of the race,everything seemed to pour into that kiss.

When we finally broke apart, I was breathless."I..."

Brandon pulled me back against his chest, a low laugh escaping him."A bit late to be shy now, isn't it?"

My face burned as I pushed against his chest halfheartedly. Then I remembered something and bit my lip, "We're going to lose the race."

"Does that matter?" His dark eyes held mine, thumb tracing my lower lip. I shook my head, smiling. It had never been about the race anyway.In my mind, Brandon had already won-in more ways than one.
###Chapter 62: Brandon, You'll Protect Me,Rgt?

**Brandon's POV**
We crossed the finish line. June's presence beside me was a warm distraction, her earlier kiss still lingering on my lips. The memory of her boldness made something possessive stir in my chest. She'd initiated that kiss - my usually cautious wife had made the first move. The thought brought a slight smile to my face.
The red-haired leader approached as we stepped out of the car, his respect evident in the way he held himself. He pulled out a cigarette,offering it with a grin. "Nice driving, man! Where'd you learn those moves?"
I caught the cigarette with practiced ease, turning it between my fingers without lighting it. His eyes followed the movement, clearly impressed by even this small display of control.
"Want to join our crew?" He asked eagerly. "We could use someone with your skills."

I allowed myself a slight smile. "But I lost."

He laughed, shaking his head. "No way, man. We all know who really won here."

"The rules were clear," I kept my tone light as I handed the cigarette back."I'm the last one who past the line." As I turned to guide June back to the car, his voice called out behind us:"Hey,wait! You can take your prize, you know?"I shook my head without turning. "Keep it.""At least tell us your name?" The eagerness in his voice was almost endearing. "Let's stay in touch!"
One of the crew members stepped forward, his eyes fixed on my license plate. "Wait a minute..." His voice trailed off as realization dawned.
"Holy shit," another racer whispered. "Brandon Stark?"

The red-haired leader's eyes widened. "No way... *The* Brandon Stark?Wall Street's most powerful CEO?"

I met his gaze steadily, neither confirming nor denying.

"Man, if we'd known who you were..." The leader shook his head in disbelief. "You could have smoked us all if you wanted. Why'd you stop?"
"Had something more important to attend to." My eyes flickered briefly to June.
"Damn," the leader laughed. "Getting schooled by Brandon Stark himself.Guess we need more practice, boys!"

\---
The drive home was filled with a different kind of tension. June kept stealing glances at me when she thought I wasn't looking, her tongue darting out to wet her lips nervously. Every time she did, I had to resist the urge to pull over and kiss her again.

"You could have won easily," she finally broke the silence. "And they admitted you were better! Why didn't you take the prize?" I raised an eyebrow,keeping my eyes on the road. "You wanted it?" She hesitated, then nodded almost shyly, "You were clearly better than them. Why give up the prize?" "We can go back and get it if you want." I couldn't resist teasing her. Her hand shot out to grab my arm, the touch sending warmth through my sleeve. "No, no! I was just saying... They're probably gone anyway."
The rest of the drive passed in comfortable silence, broken only by June's soft breathing as she dozed off. By the time we reached the Hamptons estate, she was fighting to keep her eyes open.
"We're home," I said softly, reaching over to ruffle her hair.

She ducked away with an adorable pout. "Stop treating me like a kid! And don't pat my head ever again!"



The familiar comfort of my study welcomed me as I settled in to deal with the day's remaining business. James's updates about Matthew and the Taylor situation demanded immediate attention.
"Sir, about Matthew," James's voice carried his characteristic efficiency. "He's in police custody now, but he's refusing to reveal who's behind all this.Without that information, it complicates our next steps. How should we proceed?"
"Contact Edward Lee," I instructed, remembering the calculating gleam in Edward's eyes whenever Matthew was mentioned. "He'll know what to do."
"I see." The pieces were falling into place exactly as I'd expected. "Also, sir," James continued, "our sources confirm Capital Corp is in serious trouble. That's why Richard Taylor is pushing for Victoria's marriage to Alexander. They desperately need Stark Group's support."I leaned back slightly, pieces clicking into place. "Look into Summer's history with the Taylor family. Don't tell her about this yet." A soft knock interrupted whatever James had been about to say.June stood in the doorway, her damp hair falling in waves around her shoulders. The sight of her in silk pajamas, looking soft and vulnerable,made something protective stir in my chest.
"Am I disturbing you?" Her voice was barely above a whisper.

"Come here." I gestured her closer, noting how she clutched the neckline of her robe.

"It's late," she said softly. "Shouldn't you rest?"

My gaze dropped to where the silk robe clung to her curves, lingering on the generous swell of her breasts. She caught the direction of my stare and quickly tightened her grip on the neckline, a beautiful blush spreading across her cheeks. "Stop staring!"
I waited as she gathered her thoughts, watching various emotions play across her expressive face. Finally, she spoke: "About that video James sent... The one of me. You were there that night... I don't know what my father or Charles Windsor really wants." Her voice cracked slightly."Brandon,you'll protect me,right?"
The vulnerability in her tone made my jaw clench. "Are you scared?"

"A little." The admission seemed to cost her something.

"Don't worry about it." I kept my voice gentle despite the rage building in my chest. "T'Il handle everything." She nodded, clearly fighting exhaustion. As she turned to leave, I couldn't resist: "Is my wife inviting me to bed?" The blush that spread across her cheeks was absolutely worth it."What?No! I... I should go rest. You should too!"At the door, she paused and turned back. "Brandon... thank you."The soft sincerity in her voice made something warm unfurl in my chest.I watched her disappear down the hallway, already planning exactly how I would destroy everyone who had dared to hurt her.
###Chapter 63: Summer's Secret


**Victoria's POV**
The Taylor mansion's marble floors echoed with the sharp click of my heels as I stormed through the grand entrance. My hands trembled with barely contained rage as Brandon Stark's dismissive words played on repeat in my mind. The humiliation burned through my veins like acid,making my breath come in short, angry gasps.
*How dare he? How DARE he treat me like I'm nothing?*

I. Victoria Taylor - Hollywood's rising star, society's darling, the one everyone wanted to be or be with. What made Summer so special? She was nothing but a pathetic little corporate drone at Fortune Corp,and yet somehow she'd caught Brandon Stark's attention?
The Italian crystal vase made a satisfying crash as it shattered against the wall,sending prismatic shards skittering across the floor. Not enough. The antique clock followed. Each explosion of breaking pottery sent a jolt of bitter satisfaction through my body.
"Miss Victoria!" Betty, our newest maid, scurried after me with a dustpan,her mousy features pinched with concern. "Please be careful with the antiques! You might hurt yourself!" "You think this is funny?" I whirled on her, my voice rising to a shriek."You're  laughing at me, aren't you?" "No. Miss Victoria, I would never-"My hand shot out, tangling in her brown hair. The sharp gasp of pain as I yanked brought a cruel smile to my face. "Don't lie to me! I saw you I caught her reflection in one of the gilded mirrors - was that a hint of a smirk playing at her lips? The sight made something snap inside me. smirking! You think it's hilarious that Summer got what I wanted, don't you?"
Betty crumpled to the floor, tears streaming down her face. "Please, Miss Victoria! I wasn't laughing, I swear!"
"Wasn't laughing?" I tightened my grip, satisfaction coursing through me as she whimpered. "You think you can lie to my face? You're just like all the others, aren't you? Always taking her side-"

"Victoria!"
Grandpa George's commanding voice cut through my rage like a knife. He stood in the doorway, leaning heavily on his cane, his weathered face tight with disapproval. Mom appeared behind him, her perfectly mnanicured hand coming to rest on his shoulder.
"Father," Mom's voice carried that particular note of maternal concern she'd perfected over the years. "Victoria's clearly upset. Something must have happened..."
"Mom..." I let my voice crack, tears filling my eyes on command.

"Look at what she's done to the house!" Grandpa gesturedat the destruction around us, his voice sharp with anger. "Is this how we raised you? To throw tantrums like a spoiled child when things don't go your way?"

"Father," Mom's voice took on a reproachful tone. "Victoria's a successful actress now. If she's this upset, someone must have really hurt her feelings. "Hurt her feelings?" Grandpa's laugh held no humor. "She's been Hollywood's darling since her first role. The whole world bends over backward to please her. Who could possibly hurt precious Victoria?" The bitterness in his tone made my blood boil. "You're just angry because I'm not your precious Summer!"
"Victoria!" Dad's sharp voice made me flinch. I hadn't even noticed him arriving.
"What?" I met his gaze defiantly. "Am I wrong? Grandpa's always favored her.Summer can do no wrong in his eyes!"
"Enough!" Dad's face had gone an interesting shade of red."Go to your room.Now."


\---

"What happened, darling?" Mom asked me later.

My eyes gleamed. This was exactly the opening I needed. "It's all because of Summer."

"Summer?" Mom's voice rose sharply, immediate displeasure coloring her tone. "What did she do this time? Did she cause trouble for you?"
I let my eyes water slightly, the perfect picture of a wronged daughter. "I saw these shoes today - you know the ones from Paris Fashion Week? The ones my favorite actress wore? They finally had them in Manhattan, but..”I let my voice crack slightly. "Summer and this man just... they humiliated me,Mom!"

"A man?" Mom's attention sharpened instantly, her eyes narrowing."Summer was with a man? Are you sure about this?" "Yes," I confirmed. "And you know she's still playing innocent with Alexander! How could she do this to me? She knows how I feel about him,and yet here she is,going around with other men!""That little Viper!" Mom's grip on my hand tightened painfully."Has anyone else heard about this?"

"No. I haven't told anyone." I said quickly.

"Good. Don't breathe a word of this to anyone - not even Alexander. Do you understand?"
I frowned slightly. "But why? Mom, if Summer's seeing someone behind Alexander's back..."

"No. Victoria." Mom's voice turned sharp. "Have you forgotten about Charles Windsor?"
The name sent a jolt through me. Suddenly, I remembered the birthday party, watching Mom carefully prepare that special tea with double the usual dose. We'd had Summer right where we wanted her, and yet somehow she'd slipped away.
A slow smile spread across my face as understanding dawned."Mom...is this about the video Dad received?"

Mom's eyes glittered dangerously. "Charles has always preferred...innocent gírls. The fact that Summer's running around with other men needs to stay our little secret. Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"Perfectly." I couldn't help the vicious satisfaction blooming in my chest."Don't worry, Mom. I won't say a word to anyone."

"Good girl." Mom patted my hand. "Now, let Mommy handle everything.We'll make sure Summer learns her place soon enough." Later that night, I crept down the hallway toward Dad's study, drawn by the sound of raised voices. The thick mahogany door didn't quite muffle their argument. 
"-can't risk it. Elizabeth!" Dad's voice carried clearly through the door."Father already knows about what happened at his birthday party. If we try anything else-"

"What choice do we have?" Mom's voice held an edge of hysteria."Capital Corp needs that investment! Two hundred million dollars, Richard. Where else are we going to get that kind of money?"

"But Summer-"

"She's lived off our charity long enough!" Mom's voice turned sharp. "It's time she did something for this family!"

"You're insane," Dad's voice dropped lower, forcing me to press closer to the door. "We're never discussing this again. Do you want everyone to know?"

"What does it matter?" Mom's bitter laugh made me flinch. "This has nothing to do with you anyway. We shouldn't have taken her back when-


"Elizabeth!" Dad's voice cracked like a whip. "Never speak of this again.Do you understand? Never!"

I sagged against the wall, my mind spinning. The way Mom talked about Summer, the secrets, Dad's reaction... The implications made my head hurt.


"Good grief, I need to think!" Dad's exhausted voice interrupted my thoughts. "We need to find a way to get Summer to come home." "Think about what?" Mom's voice turned sharp. "Don't forget about the Windsors..." "Enough!" Dad's tone brooked no argument. "I know you don't like her,Do you think I do? Father isn't blind - he knows exactly what we're trying to do."

1 pulled away from the door, a slow smile spreading across my face as pieces clicked into place. Whatever secrets they were hiding about Summer's past, one thing was clear - she wasn't what everyone thought she was.And that... well, that just made everything so much more interesting.What I need now is just patience.
###Chapter 64: Threats

**Summer's POV**

The next day at work, the sharp click of familiar footsteps made me look up from my computer screen. Alexander was heading straight for my desk,his face tight with barely contained emotion. My stomach clenched as I recognized that look - it never meant anything good.

"You yesterday..." he started, his voice carrying an edge I'd never heard before.

I kept my expression professionally neutral despite how my pulse quickened. "Did you need something?"

"You didn't come home last night!" His voice rose slightly, drawing curious glances from nearby cubicles. "Running around all night - do you have any idea what people will say? A young woman like you..."
"Excuse me?" I set down my papers carefully, figting to keep my voice steady. "Since when do I need to report my whereabouts to you?"
Alexander's face darkened as I stood to leave. He caught up in two quick strides, grabbing my arm. "Summer! Where were you last night? It was Brandon, wasn't it? That bastard - do you even know what kind of person he is? How could you just spend the night with someone like that? Have you thought about what people will say?"
"Enough!" The word burst out. My mind flashed to Brandon - his quiet strength, the way he always seemed to appear when I needed him most. "He's not the kind of person you think he is." I said firmly.
"Summer, how could you disappoint me like this?" Alexander's eyes were wild with something that looked unsettlingly like possession. "How could you do this to me?" Before I could react, his hands shot out, grabbing my shoulders with bruising force. The world tilted as he shoved me into the empty elevator,my back hitting the wall hard enough to knock the breath from my lungs.
"Let go!" I gasped, fear and fury warring in my chest. "Alexander, you've lost your mind! Let me go!"
He pressed closer, his cologne suddenly suffocating. "Tell me the truth -did you sleep with him? Answer me!"
Terror gave me strength. I thrashed against his grip, managing to land a stinging slap across his face. "Look at who I am! I'm Summer, not Victoria.If you want to go crazy, go find Victoria!"
The mention of his fiancée's name had an unexpected effect. Instead of backing off, he suddenly wrapped his arms around me in a crushing embrace.
"Summer, I'm sorry," his voice turned sickeningly sweet. "You know you're the one I really love. Victoria... that was just a moment of weakness.She seduced me.Summer."
"Let go," I could barely breathe through his grip. "Let go or I'Il scream."

"Go ahead," his tone turned ugly. "Scream. And I'll tell everyone how you're still in love with me, how we were together first. Summer, I know you're angry about Victoria, but you have to understand-she has Capital Corp shares. I had no choice. But once we're married and those shares are mine,I'll divorce her. Then we can be together." The words hit like physical blows. With strength born of desperation, I drove my knee up between his legs. The moment his grip loosened, I lunged for the elevator buttons. "You don't love me anymore, is that it?" He wheezed, still managing to catch my wrist, "So you've fallen for that thug instead?" "He's not a thug." The defense came automatically. I took a deep breath.meeting his eyes steadily. "And go fuck yourself."

\---
My phone's shrill ring felt like an ice pick through my skull. I stared at the screen for long moments before finally answering.
"Why did it take so long to pick up?" Elizabeth's sharp voice carried its usual note of displeasure.
The familiar tone sent a lance of pain through my chest. No matter how many times she proved otherwise, some small part of me still couldn't understand how she could treat her own daughter like this. Victoria got all her maternal warmth while I... I got this.
"I was working," I managed, trying to keep the bitterness from my voice."Did you need something?"
No matter how much I resented her, I couldn't change the fact that she was my mother. That truth was carved into my bones, impossible to excise.
"Come home!" The command in her voice hadn't changed since my childhood. "Don't forget, this is your høme. Your grandfather has been so good to you..."
"I'm busy." I cut her off, unable to bear another lecture about family duty.


"Busy?" She scoffed. "What could you possibly be busy with? You're just an employee. Listen carefully - if you don't come home today..."
"Then what?" A bitter laugh escaped me. "If you'd shown even a fraction of the concern for me that you show for Victoria, maybe I wouldn't dread coming home so much." "What are you implying?" Her voice turned deadly soft. "That this is my fault? Summer, I'm warning you - if you don't come home today, you'll regret it."
Ice crystallized in my veins. "What could I possibly have to regret?"

"Those videos of you and Charles Windsor are right here."The satisfaction in her voice made me want to throw up. "Think carefully about what you might regret. Come home. Now."
My voice shook despite my best efforts. "I'm your daughter too! How could you do this to me?"

"There is no 'how could I." The casual cruelty in her voice felt like knives in my chest. "Capital Corp needs funding, and Charles is willing to provide it. If you still consider me your mother, come home. Otherwise, these videos go public. Your choice."
Her voice softened to something almost maternal. "You should understand - Charles is the third son of the Windsor family. They're far more powerful than the Taylors. If you become his woman, everything the Windsors have could be yours. I've arranged everything for you. One day you'll thank me for this."

The mask of maternal concern made bile rise in my throat. But those videos in her hands were a ticking time bomb. Elizabeth would do anything for Victoria - if she gave those videos to my sister... I couldn't even imagine surviving that kind of humiliation.

"Fine," I forced the words past numb lips. "I'll meet you. But not at home." "Perfect." The satisfaction in her voice made my skin crawl.
The moment the call ended, my legs gave out. I slid down the wall,staring blindly ahead as the world spun around me. "Miss Taylor!" Amy's worried voice seemed to come from very far away."Are you alright?"
I forced my lips into something approximating a smile. "I'm fine.Everything's fine."
Back at my desk, my trembling fingers found Brandon's contact in my phone. I stared at his name for long moments before changing the contact to simply "Bran."

The first call went straight to voicemail.

*Maybe he's in a meeting?* I tried again immediately.

My fingers shook as I hit redial for the third time. The phone felt impossibly heavy in my hand as I waited, praying to hear his deep voice instead of another voicemail message.

*Please pick up. Brandon, I need you...*

But only silence answered.
###Chapter 65: Taking Precautions


**Summer's POV**
The walls of my Fortune Corp office felt like they were closing in. After Elizabeth's threat, I could barely breathe. The video from the birthday party hung over my head like a sword, ready to drop at any moment.I needed help, and with Brandon unreachable...
Ruby answered on the first ring. "What's up girl? Want to grab lunch?"

"Sort of..." My voice cracked as I tried to explain the situation. The words tumbled out in a rush - Elizabeth's call, the threats, the video.
"What the hell?" Ruby's voice rose sharply. "Elizabeth and that Windsor guy... What kind of sick game are they playing? Where's your husband?What does Brandon say?"
I caught my lower lip between my teeth. "He knows about the video situation and promised to handle it. But Elizabeth just contacted me today - I don't think he knows yet. I tried calling him, but he seems busy." The admission felt like acid in my mouth. "What should I do about this?"
"Your mother is something else!" Ruby's anger crackled through the phone.
"Using that kind of video to threaten you? Shouldn't she be protecting you and fighting against the Windsors?"
The silence stretched between us. My lack of response must have hit Ruby hard because her voice suddenly softened. "Oh god, I'm sorry..." "It's fine, you're right." I swallowed hard. "I have to meet her today. Ruby,can you help me?" "Of course!" The immediate response made something warm unfurl in my chest."When and where tonight?" "Seven o'clock, at The Plaza Hotel." My fingers twisted nervously in my blouse. "Please,you have to come!"
"Got it." Ruby's voice carried absolute conviction. "And hey, try calling Brandon again. He needs to know about this."
After hanging up, I stared at Brandon's contact info again. One more try couldn't hurt. This time, the call connected almost immediately.
"Yes?" His deep voice sent relief flooding through me.

For a moment, I couldn't speak, my reliefat hearing his voice colliding with the terror of Elizabeth's threats in my throat. The comfort of his deep tone made me want to curl up somewhere safe and just listen to him breathe, but we didn't have that luxury right now.

"June?" The slight concern in his tone made my heart skip.


"Yes, it's me. Brandon."
I could hear the smile in his voice. "I was in a board meeting," his deep voice carried a hint of apology. "Had my phone on silent - there's been quite a battle." A pause, then: "What's wrong?"
"My mother called today." The words cameout smaller than intended.


His tone sharpened instantly. "What did she say?"

"About that video..." I twisted my fingers nervously. "Brandon, she wants to meet." The sound of his fingers drumming against his desk carried clearly through the phone."You agreed?""Yes." I closed my eyes, hating how weak I sounded. "She threatened to release the videos if I didn't show up. Brandon, should I go?" "Go." His voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse race. "Let's see what she's really after. I'll come with you."
"No need." The words tumbled out before I could stop them. "When I couldn't reach you earlier, I called Ruby. She's a reporter and agreed to come with me."
Something dangerous flickered in his tone. "That works too. It's probably better if I don't show up right now. Not for my sake, but for you..."
"You agreed we'd keep our marriage private for now." I couldn't quite keep the tremor from my voice.
His soft sigh made my chest ache. "Right. So I'm supposed to stay hidden."

"Don't be like that." A helpless laugh escaped me. "I'll...I'll introduce you to my friends next time, okay? Tonight I'll go with Ruby. She's a reporter,she can help!"
"Fair enough." The amusement in his voice eased some of the tension in my shoulders. "Be careful. I'll wait for you at home."

"Okay."



The Plaza Hotel loomed before us, its elegant facade a stark reminder of another party - Alexander and Victoria's engagement celebration.The memory made my stomach turn. "Here." Ruby pulled something from her bag, pressing it into my hands. "Take these." I stared at the small devices in confusion. "What's this?" "Audío recomder and hidden camera." She grinned, but her eyes were serious. "Hey, I'm a journalist- these are essential tools,right?" "Why are you giving me these?"
Ruby's expression hardened. "Your mother threatens you with a video and you're asking why? After what happened at the party, we need insurance.Who knows what they might try?"
Her fingers moved quickly, showing me how to operate the equipment."When you get in, find a chance to place the recorder under the table. Make sure it's running - we need to record everything."
The weight of the devices felt impossibly heavy in my hands. "Ruby..."

"Better safe than sorry." Her voice softened slightly. "They may be your parents, but after what happened last time..."

I managed a weak smile. "I get it."
"The camera goes in your purse." She helped me position it carefully."Make sure it captures your parents and Charles Windsor.Got it?"
My heart clenched at the name. *Charles Windsor.* The man who'd drugged me at my grandfather's party, who'd filmed me in that vulnerable state. And now my own mother was trying to force me to meet him again.
"Summer?" Ruby's concerned voice broke through my spiraling thoughts."You okay?"
I straightened my spine, forcing steel into my voice. "I'm fine."*have to be.*
###Chapter 66: Apologize to Mr. Windsor

**Summer's POV**

I couldn't help smiling as Ruby demonstrated how to use the recording equipment for what felt like the tenth time. Her genuine concern warmed my heart in a way my own family never managed anymore.

"What are you smiling about?" Ruby's sharp voice cut through my dark thoughts. "This is serious! Listen to me carefully!"

I carefully tucked the recording device into my purse, double-checking the hidden camera. "I know, I know. Don't worry, I'll be careful!" The words came out softer than intended as emotion threatened to overwhelm me. *How did I get so lucky to have a friend like Ruby?* While my own sister plotted behind my back, here was Ruby, going above and beyond to protect me.

Ruby's frown deepened as she studied my face. "Fine, call me overprotective. But you have to be extra careful, especially with drinks.Don't consume anything they offer you."
"I understand." The weight of the recording equipment felt impossibly heavy in my bag, a physical reminder of how far things had fallen. That I needed to secretly record a meeting with my own family...
"They're here!" Ruby's whispered urgently. We watched as Richard,Elizabeth, and Victoria swept through the hotel's grand entrance, my sister'
s perfect posture a stark contrast to our mother's agitated movements.I managed a bitter smile, patting her shoulder."I should head in."∗t′S almost funny,* I thought, watching Victoria's perfect posture as she disappeared into the hotel, *My sister walks like she's still on a movie set,always performing,* The realization brought more sadness than anger now -when had we become such strangers?

Ruby's hand shot out, gripping my arm. "Wait! Let's wait for Charles Windsor to arrive first!"

I shook my head firmly. "No time. I've met Charles before - he's more complicated than he appears. I need to plant these devices before he gets here!"

"Okay!" Ruby nodded, "Go on then, I'Il be in the next room!"

My phone's sudden buzz made us both jump. Elizabeth's name flashed across the screen, making my stomach clench.

"Where are you?" My mother's sharp voice carried its usual note of displeasure. "Summer, don't try anything clever. You must come. It's almost seven."

I forced my voice to remain steady despite how my hands shook. "Almost there.Which room?"

"The Plaza, room 3702. Come up immediately."

The elevator ride to the 37th floor felt endless. Each floor that passed brought me closer to whatever trap they'd set. My reflection in the mirrored walls looked pale but determined. *I'm not that naive girl anymore,* I reminded myself. *The one who believed family meant unconditional love, who thought Victoria's cruelty was just sisterly teasing,who trusted Elizabeth's maternal facade.* Brandon's strength seemed to flow through me just thinking about him. And now I had Ruby too -proof that real love didn't need manipulation or threats. As I approached room 3702,voices carried clearly through the heavy door. "Mom, didn't you say she was coming?" Victoria's anxious tone made me pause. "What if she changed her mind?" Elizabeth's cold laugh sent shivers down my spine. "Impossible. That stupid girl wouldn't dare. Or did youforget about the video I have?"

"Who's out there?" Richard's voice boomed suddenly. "Open the door!"

I took a deep breath, squared my shoulders, and pushed open the door.Victoria immediately rushed forward, her perfect smile firmly in place. "Summer,you came!"

I stepped back before she could touch me, watching her expression falter slightly.

"Summer," she tried again, her voice dripping with fake concern, "I know you're still angry,but..."

"Angry?" I cut her off, keeping my voice deliberately light. "Why would I be angry? What have you done that's worth getting angry about?"

Victoria's perfect mask cracked just slightly as she shot a helpless look at Elizabeth.

Our mother slammed her hand on the table, making the crystal glasses rattle. "Watch your attitude! What right do you have to be angry with your sister? We should be the angry ones!"

I met her gaze steadily, refusing to flinch. Something in my expression must have startled her because she faltered for just a moment before recovering her usual venom."Don't blame us for being harsh," Elizabeth's voice dripped with false concern. "You know the Winddsors' position on Wall Street. Charles Windsor showing interest in you is a blessing you don't deserve. Don't be ungrateful." "Is that so?" I turned to Richard, who'd been suspiciously quiet. "Father thinks I'm being ungrateful too?" His uncomfortable silence spoke volumes.

I let my gaze sweep the suite, noting potential places to plant the recording device while keeping my tone casual. "A blessing? How thoughtful of you, Mother! Such a golden opportunity,and instead of saving it for your beloved Victoria, you're giving it to your disappointing younger daughter. How very generous of you!"

"You ungrateful little-" Elizabeth's face contorted with rage. "I'm your mother! Do you think I'd harm you?"

"Of course not," I couldn't keep the bitterness from my voice. "You didn't drug my tea, you didn't film me, and you're not the one forcing me here today."

A lazy drawl from the doorway made my blood run cold. "Long time no see,Summer."

Charles Windsor leaned against the doorframe with casual elegance, his presence immediately dominating the room. Elizabeth and Richard scrambled to their feet. "Mr. Windsor, please come in!"

I caught Victoria secretly studying Charles's refined features, jealousy flickering across her face before she could hide it.

Charles settled into the seat beside me, pushing an empty glass my way."Do me a favor?"

I forced myself to stay still as I poured his drink, fighting the urge to recoil from his proximity. "Mr. Windsor, we're honored you could join us." Richard's tone dripped with obsequious charm. "About last time - Summer was just being impulsive,Please forgive her youthful mistake."Charles raised one perfect eyebrow. "Oh? Is that why you called me here
###Chapter 67: Tasting Despair

**Brandon's POV**

June's call had left me more unsettled than I cared to admit. The tremor in her voice, the way she tried to sound brave even as fear crept in - it made something protective and dangerous stir in my chest. I'd promised to stay away, to let her handle this herself, but...

"James." My voice carried absolute authority as I hit the intercom. "Find out which room the Taylors booked at The Plaza. Then get everything ready - surveillance, security, all of it. I want eyes and ears on that entire floor."

A few minutes later.

"Done, sir." James said. "Room 3702."

A slight smile tugged at my lips. "Good. Have the car brought around."

The drive to The Plaza felt endless, my mind racing through contingencies.June might think she needed to face her family alone, but I'd be damned if I let her walk into another trap unprotected. The memory of finding her drugged at her grandfather's party still made my blood boil.
The Plaza's thick carpeting muffled our approach as we neared room 3701.James had already secured the entire floor - necessary precautions when dealing with someone like Charles Windsor. The bastard had no idea who he was really dealing with. The door opened silently, revealing a young woman with short hair pressed against the adjoining wall. She spun around at our entrance,eyes widening in alarm. "You are?" Her voice carried more steel than fear. James stepped forward smoothly. "This is Mr. Stark's room.Perhaps you'd like to explain your presence here?"

I studied her carefully - this must be Ruby Scott, the war correspondent June had mentioned. Her defensive posture and quick assessment of exits marked her as someone used to dangerous situations. Good. June needed friends like this.

"Brandon Stark." I introduced myself simply, watching understanding dawn in her eyes.

"Oh thank god!" Relief flooded her face. "You're Summer's husband! She told me about you. Mr. Stark, you have to help -they're threatening her with some video and that Charles Windsor is here and-"

"I know." I cut her off gently, gesturing for her to take a seat. The monitoring equipment James had set up covered every angle of room 3702.June's voice carried through clearly, making my jaw clench. Even through the grainy footage, I could see how they crowded her, trying to break her spirit.

"You're just going to watch?" Ruby's voice rose slightly. "We have to do something! Summer's in there alone with those people!"

"Miss Scott." I kept my voice steady despite the rage building in my chest."Do you really think June is that easily broken?"

Ruby's expression shifted from outrage to thoughtful consideration."No...actually, Summer's stronger than most people realize. It's just... these are her family members. They know exactly how to hurt her." "Precisely." I settled into one of the chairs, eyes fixed on the monitors.Every cell in my body screamed to intervene, to shield June from their poison. But she needed this - needed to face the truth about her family head-on. "She needs to face this. Sometimes you have to taste true despair 
before you can break free."

"That's cruel!" Ruby protested, but there was understanding in her eyes.

"Crueler than what they're doing to her now?" I raised an eyebrow, even as my hands clenched into fists beneath the table. "You're her friend -you've watched this pattern repeat for years, haven't you?"

Ruby's silence was answer enough.

My eyes never left the montor as June squared her shoulders, facing down her so-called family with quiet dignity. Pride and protectiveness warred in my chest. *Show them who you really are, June. Show them they can't break you anymore.*

\---

**Summer's POV**

The weight of Charles Windsor's gaze made my skin crawl as I shifted in my seat. The Plaza's elegant dining room suddenly felt suffocating,trapped here with the very people who were supposed to protect me.

"Mr. Taylor," Charles's lazy drawl carried an edge of amusement,"your family certainly puts on quite a show."

Richard's face turned an interesting shade of red. "Mr. Windsor, please forgive my younger daughter's behavior. She's being incredibly rude-"

"Actually," Charles cut him off smoothly, "I find Summer quite fascinating." His eyes found mine with predatory focus. "Won't you sit down, Miss Taylor?"
 "Excuse me." I stood abruptly, unable to bear another moment of his presence. "I need to use the restroom." Victoria's heels clicked against the marble floor as she followed me out.I could feel her perfect mask cracking with every step.

"Charles Windsor choosing you is a blessing," she hissed once we were alone in the hallway. "You should be grateful!"

I turned to face her, finally letting my own mask drop. "Grateful? Like how grateful I should be that you stole my fiancé?"

"Don't act so superior!" Victoria's composure shattered completely. "You think I don't know about the video? Mom has it ready to release any time.And Charles Windsor... well, you've heard the rumors about his...particular tastes, haven't you?"

Ice crystallized in my veins as I studied the stranger wearing my sister's face. "Drop the act, Victoria. We both know you've never seen me as a sister."

"Of course not!" The words exploded from her like poison. "Why should you get everything? I'm just as good as you - better even! But somehow you're always the special one!"

"You're not worse than me," I said quietly, studying her perfect features twisted with hatred. "You might even be better in many ways. Victoria,what exactly is your problem with me? I'm done talking to you."

"Scared?" Her laugh held no humor. "Well, you should be. The venom in her voice made my skin crawl. "You won't escape this, Summer."

"That's not for you to decide," I met her gaze steadily.I pushed past her into the bathroom, feeling her eyes burning into my back. Something about her expression made me uneasy. This wasn't like Victoria- normally she would have kept pushing, kept twisting the knife.Why back off so quickly? The thought nagged at me as I washed my hands. The bathroom felt eerily quiet, the elegant marble surfaces suddenly oppressive. Then I caught a glimpse of movement in the mirror- a dark figure appearing behind me with terrifying speed. Before I could react,a hand clamped over my mouth.pressing something sweet-smelling against my face.

My last coherent thought as consciousness slipped away was of Brandon.

The world went black.
###Chapter 68: I Promise She'll Be Safe

**Brandon's POV**

Ruby paced nervously behind me, her war correspondent training evidlent in how she positioned herself to see both the door and the monitors. "We should do something," she muttered for what felt like the hundredth time.

The surveillance feed from room 3702 showed Victoria returning with a satisfied smile, her perfectly manicured fingers tapping out a message on her phone. Through the camera, I watched her lean close to Charles Windsor, who lounged on the leather sofa with practiced indolence.

"Mr. Windsor," Victoria's voice dripped honey, "Summer's had a change of heart. She wants to surprise you."

Elizabeth jumped in immediately, her maternal mask firmly in place. "Mr.Windsor.you may not know this, but my younger daughter is quite shy.She's actually expressed her admiration for you privately." Her smile turned conspiratorial. "Summer has such genuine feelings for you."

Richard stood silently by the window, his eyes darting nervously toward the door. The man's tells were pathetically obvious - he knew exactly what they'd planned for his own daughter.

Charles's lazy smile widened as he rose from the sofa. "Well then, who am I to keepo the lady waiting?" His movements were too precise,too measured as he straightened his jacket. "I believe I'll take my leave now.After all, it would be rude to keep Miss Summer waiting for too long." My fingers tightened on the desk as I watched him exit 3702. The moment he disappeared from the camera's view, I hit the intercom. "James. Lock down every exit. No one leaves The Plaza." 
Ruby said anxiously. "Where's he going? We have to find Summer!"

"No." I kept my voice steady despite the rage building in my chest. The sight of Elizabeth practically offering her daughter to Charles again made something dark and violent stir inside me. But I couldn't let that show -not now, not when June needed me thinking clearly. "James will escort you home."

"Mr. Stark." Ruby's voice cracked with emotion as she watched Elizabeth's performance on screen. "I've known Summer since college. She's always tried so hard to please them, to be the daughter they wanted. And now they're just..." She trailed off, hands clenching into fists.

I understood her fury all too well. The protective instinct that roared through my veins demanded immediate action, demanded that I make them pay for every time they'd hurt June. But that wasn't what she needed right now.

"No!" Her protest carried genuine concern. "I'm not leaving without Summer!"

"If you truly care about her safety, you'll stay put." I watched Charles's careful movements on the monitor. "I'll handle this."

"But Summer-"

"I'm her husband." The words carried more weight than I'd intended. "I promise she'lI be perfectly fine tomorrow. Those recordings you helped her set up might prove useful very soon." Ruby's hesitation was brief but noticeable. "I... alright." "Miss Scott." I softened my tone slightly. "We may need your professional skills again soon." "Anything for Summer, Just keep her safe." "Get Marcus on the line." I kept my voice steady despite the rage building in my chest. The fact that I couldn't see where Charles was headed made something dark and violent stir inside me.

The connection was immediate. "Brandon? What's wrong?"

"You don't know where Charles is right now, do you?" I let the implications hang in the air.

Marcus's sharp intake of breath was audible. "Charles? That fucking troublemaker..."

"He's at The Plaza." My voice carried just a hint of steel.

"I'll handle it." Marcus's tone promised swift action.

"Stop him quickly, Marcus. And I'll give you the land you've always wanted."

Several minutes later my phone buzzed -Marcus. "Go to room 808. Took a while to make Charles tell me where he is. That fool... You'd better be quick because I'm not sure if he would listen to me..."

I was already moving before he finished speaking. The eighth floor hallway was silent as I approached room 808, but the faint sound of voices carried through the door. The door to 808 was unlocked - another deliberate message from Charles.The moment I stepped inside, my trained eyes began cataloging details.The lingering sweetness in the air told me they'd used some kind of drug.The hotel's surveillance device had been destroyed - Charles making sure there'd be no direct evidence of what transpired. James's professional mask cracked into a slight smile. "Victoria's entire life is an open book to us now.""Perfect." I allowed myself a cold smile, absently stroking June's hair as she shifted restlessly.′′Iwant headlines about Victoria tomorrow.Make My eyes caught more details as I moved closer. The careful placement of the broken vase pieces. The deliberate shallow cut on her hand,precise enough to leave a mark without causing real damage. Even the way he'd positioned her on the bed -everything had been staged to send a message.

The flawless perfection of her skin seemed to mock the violence they'd tried to do here. I could almost see Charles standing over her, touching her face with those entitled hands, thinking he had the right to even look at what was mine.


"Sir?"

"Call Dr. Sean," I ordered, already shrugging off my suit jacket to wrap around June. "Have him meet us at the Hamptons estate."

I gathered Summer carefully against my chest and carried her out of the hotel. Her skin still burned with whatever drug they'd given her, but her breathing had steadied slightly.

James couldn't quite hide his surprise. He'd clearly expected more immediate retaliation, perhaps even direct conflict with the Windsor family.But the Windsors would have to wait-for now.

"The investigation into Victoria," I kept my voice low,conscious of June's proximity. "What did you find?" sure it's front page."

"Yes, sir." James hesitated briefly."And the Taylor family?"

"Leave them for now." My gaze dropped to June's sleeping face,something warm unfurling in my chest despite the rage still simmering beneath the surface. The gentle innocence of her expression made all my protective instincts surge. Right now, keeping her safe was all that mattered.
###Chapter 69: I'll Stay With You Always


**Brandon's POV**
"Every time I'm about to rest after surgery, you call." Sean's complaint carried clearly through the mansion's foyer as he strode in, medical bag in hand. Despite his words, his quick movements betrayed his concern."This better be important."
"You weren't sleeping anyway." I kept my voice steady despite the rage still simmering beneath the surface. June lay unconscious upstairs,her skin burning with whatever drug they'd given her. Every second we wasted felt like torture."Come.Now."
Sean's usual playful demeanor vanished the moment he saw June's still form on my bed. His movements turned precise and professional as he began checking her vitals.
"What happened?" His voice carried that particular edge I recognized from our collegedays - the one that meant he was genuinely worried.
"Just check her condition." The words came out sharper than intended.

Sean's hands moved with practiced efficiency as he examined June,his expression growing more focused by the second. When he reached her hand,he paused, studying the shallow cut there with narrowed eyes.
"This was deliberate," he said quietly, not looking up. "Someone knew exactly what they were doing. The cut's precise -meant to counteract whatever drug they used without causing real damage.""Brandon." Sean's voice cut through my murderous thoughts. "She's going to be fine. The drug's not dangerous - looks like a standard sedative,nothing more.Combined with exhaustion..." He trailed off, studying my face, "She just needs rest." "She's been unconscious for hours."
"Because she's sleeping," Sean's exasperation carried clearly as he packed away his equipment. "When was the last time you saw her get proper rest?The sedative's wearing off, but her body's taking advantage of the chance to recover." A slight smile tugged at his lips. "Never thought I'd see the day - Brandon Stark, worried sick over a woman."
My glare should have frozen hell itself. "If you value your life..."

A knock at the door interrupted whatever threat I'd been about to make.James entered with his usual efficiency, though something in his bearing caught my attention.
"Sir, we caught the one who drugged her." His voice dropped lower."Edward's assistant Landon is questioning him now."
"Study. Now." I cast one last look at June's sleeping form before following James out.
Sean's footsteps echoed behind us. "You got Edward's people involved?This must be serious."

"Why are you still here?"

He grinned, all traces of the professional doctor vanishing. "Can't sleep anyway. Might as well watch the show." His eyes gleamed with dangerous interest as he turned to James. "Where's Landon working?"
James glanced at me uncertainly. At my slight nod, he answered,"The usual place." "Perfect." Sean's smile turned predatory. "I'll have answers for you within twenty-four hours."The moment 'he left, James's professional mask cracked slightly."Sir,did you plan for Dr. Sullivan to take over the interrogation?"

I allowed myself a slight smile. Sean's seemingly casual interest had been exactly what I'd counted on. His methods of extracting information were...uniquely effective. "Have Landon give him whatever he needs."
"About Miss Victoria's investigation," James continued smoothly,producing a thick folder. "We found quite a bit about her activities in the entertainment industry. She's been... busy."
I studied the documents with growing satisfaction. Victoria's perfect mask hid years of careful manipulation and strategic destruction of rivals. "Not all at once," I decided, selecting one particular incident. "Start with this.Give it to the gossip magazines."

"Yes, sir." James's efficiency never wavered. "And the Windsors?"


"Later."
I spent another hour in my study before finally returning to the bedroom.The sight that greeted me made something warm unfurl in my chest -June sleeping peacefully, completely defenseless. In this unguarded state,her face held a pure innocence that stirred unfamiliar protective instincts.

After a cold shower, I emerged wearing only a white silk robe. I dimmed the lights, letting the soft glow cast gentle shadows across the room.Standing by the bed, I found myself studying her face with an intensity that surprised even me. Her breathing was deep and even, face relaxed in complete tranquility. I settled into the chair by the window, reaching out to brush my fingers along her cheek. In her sleep, June seemed to sense my touch. A small,contented smile curved he lips as she instinctively grasped my hand. Something about that unconscious gesture of trust made my breath catch.I slipped off my shoes and moved closer, the mattress dipping slightly beneath my weight. As if sensing my presence, June shifted in her sleep.making room for me beside her.

The smile that spread across her face was achingly sweet, even in dreams.Before I could pull away, her arms wrapped around my neck,drawing herself closer until she was practically draped across me.

My eyes darkened as I braced myself on one arm, looking down at her peaceful expression. She nuzzled closer, still smiling, and whispered my name with such warmth it made my chest ache, "Brandon..."

I've always taken what I wanted without hesitation, using any means necessary to achieve my goals. But with June... with her, I found myself exercising a patience I never knew I possessed. I understood her hesitation with relationships, her careful approach after being betrayed. While part of me ached for more, I would wait until she was ready to accept me completely.

When I finally moved to get up, her hand shot out, grabbing mine. "Don't go," she mumbled, still half-asleep.
My resolve melted instantly. "Alright, I won't leave." I squeezed her hand gently, threading our fingers together. "I'll stay right here with you."

Her smile of pure contentment was both reward and torture.For any other man, having their wife this close would be simple pleasure. But I wanted more than just physical intimacy- I wanted her heart given freely, not out of obligation or circumstance."Sleep," I murmnured, watching her drift deeper into dreams. "T'll stay with you always."
###Chapter 70: Dear, Don't You Remember?


**Summer's POV**
I drifted slowly from a warm dream where Brandon held my hand,leading me forward through an endless path of light. The dream felt so real that when consciousness finally crept in. I could still feel the lingering warmth in my palm.
My eyes fluttered open to find myself in the familiar master bedroom of the Hamptons estate. Soft morning light filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting everything in a gentle golden glow. The first thing I noticed was Brandon's cologne - that subtle, masculine scent that always made my pulse race.

Then I saw him.
Brandon was asleep in the armchair beside the bed, his perfect features softened by sleep. His suit jacket lay carelessly draped over the chair's arm -so unlike his usual precise habits. In the morning light,his face looked almost vulnerable, those impossibly long eyelashes casting shadows across his cheeks.
My heart did a complicated flip as memories from last night tried to surface. The Plaza Hotel... Victoria's accusations... being drugged in the bathroom... Everything after that was a blur of disconnected sensations.Panic started to build in my chest as I realized I couldn't remember how P'd gotten home.I touched my lips absently, finding them slightly swollen. Heat flooded my face as implications started to sink in. *What exactly happened last night?* His hand found mine again as I slipped them on, the gesture so natural it made my heart skip. "After Victóría and I fought..." I couldn't quite keep my voice steady. "And then being drugged in the bathroom. What really happened?" I couldn't quite meet his eyes. "You... I mean, last night..."The corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile. "Nothing happened. You're perfectly safe.""Really?" I couldn't keep the hope from my voice. "You're not just saying that?"
"Why would I lie about this?" His dark eyes held mine with quiet intensity.

I twisted my fingers nervously in the silk sheets. "But Victoria and I had that argument, then someone drugged me in the bathroom.What exactly happened?"
"They kidnapped you." His jaw tightened slightly. "But we got you out in time."
"I must have been so useless..." The words came out smaller than intended.
Brandon's fingers found mine, his touch surprisingly gentle. "Actually, you did very well. Those recording devices you and Ruby set up? They'll be very useful."
Heat crept up my neck. "That was Ruby's idea - she's a reporter,remember?"
"Mm." His approval was subtle but clear. "She's a good friend to you."

When I started to getup, Brandon moved with that predatory grace that seemed to come naturally to him. He retrieved a pair of soft slippers,setting them precisely by my feet. "The floor's cold."  slightly, but his voice remained gentle. "It was a planned kidnapping attempt. But you were never in any real danger - I had people watching. We got you out immediately."
Something about the careful way he phrased it made me wonder what details he was leaving out. But before I could press further,my phone buzzed insistently.
I fumbled for it, realizing I should probably let Ruby know I was okay.Her sleepy voice answered on the third ring: "Who dares to call at this ungodly hour? Don't you know it's bad karma to wake people up?"
"Ungodly hour? It's almost noon, Ruby."
"Summer?" All traces of sleep vanished from her voice. "Oh my god, you finally called! Do you have any idea how worried I was when you disappeared?"
My throat tightened with emotion. "I'm fine! I'mn so sorry I worried you!"

"Thank god..." The relief in her voice made tears prick at my eyes."But why are you only calling now? I was up all night worrying! Only got to bed at 5AM!"
"Go back to sleep then!" Guilt twisted in my stomach. "I just woke up myself. Brandon mentioned you were worried..."
"No, no, I'm awake now," Her voice turned sharp with interest. "But how did Brandon rescue you? He wouldn't let me help look for you." "I'm not sure about the details myself, but I'm safe now." I caught Brandon watching me with that intense focus that never failed to make my skin prickle. "Let's meet for brunch?""Definitely!"

The smell of fresh coffee and warm croissants drew me downstairs after I hung up. Brandon had already arranged everything perfectly -fresh fruit,pastries, and what looked like an entire French café's worth of breakfast options.
"Smells amazing!" I couldn't help the enthusiasm in my voice.

"Hungry?" Brandon pulled out my chair with casual elegance. "Come eat."

I studied his face as I settled into my seat, noticing the slight smile that seemed to linger at the corners of his mouth. "You seem happy."

"Shouldn't I be?"
My fingers unconsciously went to my lips again. "Did something happen last night that I should know about?"
That dangerous half-smile widened. "Dear, don't you remember what you did?"
"I was unconscious!" Heat flooded my face. "I couldn't possibly remember!You must have done something!"
His low laugh sent shivers down my spine. "If that's what you think."

"I was unconscious," I tried to sound stern despite how my pulse raced,"so whatever you say must be true!"
Brandon's phone buzzed, interrupting whatever he'd been about to say.His expression shifted subtly as he answered. "What is it?" I could hear James's carefully professional tone through the speaker. "Am I interrupting,sir?" "Report." Brandon's voice carried that gentle authority as he turned to me."Drink your tea." The casual command made something warm unfurl in my chest.I sipped obediently, watching his expression turn to ice as Jamescontinued speaking.
"Sir, Dr. Sullivan has been... thorough. The suspect insists Victoria was behind this, but we traced two payments-one from Victoria, another from an untraceable offshore account."

Brandon's fingers drummed a dangerous rhythm against the table. "And?"

"The suspect's kneecaps are... no longer intact." James's voice carried clear discomfort. "Dr. Sullivan mentioned something about his pet sharks needing feeding."
I nearly choked on my tea. Brandon's hand found mine under the table,his thumb tracing gentle circles on my palm even as his voice turned arctic."I see."

The casual way he discussed violence while still holding my hand with such tenderness should have frightened me. Instead, I found myself leaning into his touch, grateful for the protection he represented. The memory of last night's terror felt distant now, like a bad dream that couldn't touch me anymore.
*Maybe that's what safety feels like,* I thought, watching Brandon's profile in the morning light. *Not the absence of danger, but knowing someone will always come for you.*
###Chapter 71: You Married Brandon Stark?

**Summer's POV**

"Is everything okay?" Brandon's expression softened instantly as he turned to me, though I could still sense the lethal intent simmering beneath the surface.

"Nothing to worry about."

"Let them feed the sharks if they want," Brandon's casual comment to James made my spoon clatter against the bowl. "As long as we get what we need."

James's professional mask cracked slightly as he fought back a smile. "Sir,we haven't even started yet. We're just... preparing to move."

Brandon's perfect brow furrowed slightly. "Have them wait. I'll handle it myself before passing things to Sean."

I watched James's slight flinch with fascination. Whatever storm was brewing in the financial world, it was clear Brandon's methods were particularly feared.

"Understood." James's efficiency never wavered. "I'll have Landon continue investigating that offshore account. About last night's drug analysis from the hotel room - it wasn't standard fare. Based on our investigation.Victoria wouldn't have access to something like this."

"Keep digging." Brandon's command carried absolute authority. I focused on pouring his coffee, trying to distract myself from the dark undercurrents of their conversation. A sudden sting made me pause as the cup's edge brushed against my finger. "What's wrong?" Brandon's voice carried immediate concern. "It's nothing," I examined the small cut with a frown. "Must have happened last night somehow."

"Does it still hurt?" The dangerous edge in his tone made me look up.

"I'm not that delicate," I managed a smile despite howmy skin prickled under his intense scrutiny.

"Brandon." I gathered my courage, meeting those dark eyes directly.


"Hmm?"

"Thank you for last night." The words came out softer than intended."And... I'd like you to meet my friends properly sometime."
"I don't have many friends - just Ruby and Scarlett. Ruby's the war correspondent,and Scarlett owns that coffee shop next to the St. Regis."
"I remember." His voice carried a hint of amusement. "Arrange whatever time works for you. I'm free whenever - I just don't want you feeling uncomfortable."

My eyes lit up at his consíderate response. "Great! I'll meet with Ruby and Scarlett today then," I said eagerly. "It's been so long since we've all gotten together."

"Good." Brandon nodded, his thoughts clearly turning to last night's events. "Take one of the cars." I'd arranged to meet Ruby and Scarlett for a long-overdue catch-up.Given how rarely we all managed to get together these days, we were determined to make the most of it. Scarlett had always been the quieter one of our group - it's wwhy we'd partnered to open the tea shop together. When she wasn't managing the shop,she could usually be found curled up with a book. Ruby, on the other hand, was our bundle of energy. Her vibrant personality made her perfect for her job as a reporter, constantly traveling across the country for stories.

Now that we were finally all together, we were determined to enjoy ourselves properly. As we bounced from store to store, the shopping bags multiplied - though most of them, I noticed with amusement, were things Ruby insistedon buying for me rather than herself.

"You're married now," Ruby declared, holding up another designer dress against me. "You need to dress the part!" I couldn't help rolling my eyes,though privately I didn't think there was anything wrong with my usual style.

"Summer, you're married?" Scarlett's soft voice held genuine shock as we browsed through the designer boutique. I could see the concern in her eyes - after all, she knew about what had happened with Alexander.

"It was pretty recent," I managed an awkward laugh, fidgeting with a dress sleeve. "Just a registration, no ceremony. I wasn't planning to tell anyone yet, but after everything that happened, Ruby found out first."
Catching Scarlett's worried expression, I gently tugged at her sleeve. "I know it seems sudden, but our relationship is... complicated.I've been trying to figure out the right time to introduce him to you both."

"Is he good to you?" Scarlett asked softly, her usual calm demeanor giving way to protective concern. "Oh my god, he's amazing!" Ruby bounced over, practically vibrating with excitement as she grabbed Scarlett's arm. "He's absolutely gorgeous,and you wouldn't believe how he treats Summer!" Scarlett rolled her eyes at Ruby before turning back to me. "Summer, I just want to make sure you're not rushing into this." "I understand your concern," I said softly. "But trust me, this isn't some impulsive decision. You'll understand when you meet him."

Something in Ruby's expression made me pause. "Wait - when exactly did you meet him? I don't remember introducing you."

Ruby's grin turned mischievous. "Remember last night when I couldn't find you? Brandon told me to head home, said he'd findyou himself. God,you should have seen how worried he was about you! And all those rumors-about Brandon Stark being cold and untouchable - clearly they've never seen him around you!"

"Brandon Stark?" Scarlett's eyes went wide. "You married Brandon Stark?"

"Shh!" I quickly glanced around, relieved to see no one had heard. "What happened to my calm, collected friend? You're as bad as Ruby today!"

Scarlett shot me an exasperated look. "Even I have my limits! This is Brandon Stark we're talking about - of course I'm going to be shocked!"

"She's right," Ruby nodded sagely. "I had the exact same reaction when I found out." She suddenly threw an arm around my shoulders. "Hey,since we're talking about introductions, why not today? It's the weekend,and who knows when your busy CEO husband will have free time again!"

"Now?" I hesitated, then pulled out my phone. "Well, let me at least call and check if he's free."

Ruby took the opportunity to snatch my phone, scrolling through my contacts. "Hold up - you saved him as... That's adorable!" "Let me guess," Scarlett's eyes danced with amusement, her shock giving way to teasing. "Is it 'Honey'? Or maybe 'Darling?" I shot Ruby a helpless look and took back my phone to call Brandon. It was only then that I noticed them - two men in impeccable suits who seemed to appear wherever we went. always maintaining a careful distance.At first I thought I was being paranoid. but they mnoved with too much purpose, their attention too focused despite their attempts at casualness.

*Brandon.* The realization hit me with surprising warmth rather than annoyance. Of course he'd arranged security after last night. The men were clearly professionals, hanging back far enough to give us privacy while keeping watch.I caught one of them speaking quietly into an earpiece, no doubt reporting to James.
###Chapter 72: Ironic Situation

**Summer's POV**
Brandon's phone answered on the first ring, but instead of his usual crisp greeting. I heard muffled sounds in the background that made my skín prickle. *What's that noise? A man's scream?* The ominous echoes reminded me that despite his gentle treatment of me, Brandon Stark was still one of the most feared men on Wall Street.

"June?" His deep voice was gentle. "Give me a moment."

I heard him moving, his footsteps echoing against what sounded like concrete. Through the phone, I heard a unfamiliar voice: "Mr. Stark."
"Results?" Brandon's voice remained perfectly controlled despite the ominous atmosphere I could sense even through the connection.
"He just wouldn't tell us more." James hesitated slightly. "But Dr. Sullivan's methods are proving effective."
"Hand him over to Sean then." The casual way Brandon discussed what was clearly an interrogation should have frightened me. Instead,I found myself grateful he'd answered despite clearly being in the middle of something important.

"About meeting my friends," I rushed to get the words out. "Would today work?"

Ruby's voice suddenly carried through the phone as she leaned close: "Mr.Stark! When are you treating us to dinner?"
I could hear the smile in Brandon's voice at the formal address. "Now works. Where would you like to go?"
"Well, we just finished shopping." I gestured frantically at Ruby to be quiet. "No rush," Ruby waved dismissively. "Let's shop a bit more. Unless..." Her eyes narrowed playfully, "Wait, he can't cook, can he? Summer, be careful "Ruby and Scarlett said they'd like to properly meet you. Since it's the weekend..."
"Perfect." His immediate response caught me off guard. "Any preferences for the restaurant?"
"You decide! It's not even dinner time yet, you don't have to rush-"

"Do your friends have anydietary restrictions?" The gentle concern in his tone made something warm unfurl in my chest.

"They're pretty easy-going,like me."
"So, Miss Scott," Brandon's voice carried clear amusement, "restaurant preference or...?"
Ruby snatched my phone before I could stop her. "Can we come to your place? We don't really care about the food - we just want to see where Summer lives now!"
"Of course." Brandon's agreement was immediate. "Have June bring you over."
After I hung up, Ruby turned to Scarlett wvith a triumphant grin. "Brandon's so agreeable! Who would've thought?"
"First impressions matter," Scarlett pointed out reasonably. "Of course he wants to make a good one."
"Plus we get to see their home!" Ruby bounced excitedly. "See how Brandon treats our Summer."or you'll end up being the housewife!"

"That makes no sense!" I couldn't help laughing.

Scarlett nodded thoughtfully. "Ruby has a point though. Let's browse a bit longer."



The drive to the Hamptons estate gave us plenty of time to talk. Ruby couldn't contain her amazement as we drove through the exclusive neighborhood.
"Oh my god, your husband has amazing taste! I heard Hamptons property prices are insane now - it's not even about affordability anymore, it's about availability!"
"Well, he is Brandon Stark," Scarlett mused. "Summer, how did you two meet anyway?"
I hesitated,carefully choosing my words. How could I explain the complex web of circumstances that had brought Brandon and me together? The memory of our first real meeting still made my heart skip - his quiet strength when I'd needed it most, the way he'd protected me without making me feel weak. "It's quite a coincidence actually." I smiled softly,lost in the memory. "He helped me when I was in trouble. Later I found out he was my grandfather's favorite student - remember that genius from Columbia I mentioned before?" *The same genius who now looks at me like I'm the most precious thing in his world,* I added silently. "Brandon Stark?" Ruby's eyes went wide. "No way! So you married him because he was your grandfather's student?" I explained the situation with the Taylor family, watching Ruby's expression darken with each detail.with indignation. "God, this is like a movie plot! But the Taylors are horrible - you're part of the family too!"
"Summer," Scarlett's gentle voice carried clear concern, "is this really what you want? I know the Taylors forced your hand, but your feelings for Brandon..."
I took a deepbreath, meeting her worried gaze in the rearview mirror. My fingers tightened on the steering wheel as I searched for the right words to explain how Brandon had become such an essential part of my life."Scarlett, I understand your concern." The warmth that filled my chest whenever I thought of him made my voice soften. "Love grows gradually-he treats me so well, and with someone as exceptional as Brandon,falling for him feels natural." *More natural than breathing sometimes,* I added silently, remembering how safe I felt in hisarms,how his mere presence could make the world feel right again.
"As long as you know what you're doing." Scarlett's expression softened."Don't handle everything alone - we're here for you."
"Absolutely!" Ruby declared. "Call us anytime. Though Summer,it's actually interesting."

"What do you mean?"
Ruby's grin turned wicked. "Didn't you say Alexander is just a distant relative of Brandon's? By family hierarchy, he'd have to call you 'Aunt'!Can you imagine Alexander and Victoria's faces when they find out you married Brandon? Once they're married, the whole family will have to bow to you and Brandon. God, that's satisfying just to think about!" "Maybe," I murmured, though the thought did bring a slight smile to my face.  "Victoria especially will be furious.Right.Scarlett?"
is pretty ironic. Alexander and Victoria Scarlett couldn't help laughing.′′It deserve some comeuppance after how they treated you. Let Brandon put them in their place!"
###Chapter 73:Was That You?


**Summer's POV**
"I can't believe how much you've changed!" I couldn't help laughing as Scarlett fired off another sharp-tongued observation about Manhattan's elite."Ruby's been a terrible influence on you!"
"What do you mean, terrible influence?" Ruby protested from the backseat of Brandon's Porsche, which I was carefully navigating through weekend traffic. "I'm a perfectly good influence!"
The familiar banter felt like college all over again, when we'd spend hours in our favorite coffee shop near Columbia, sharing dreamns and complaints.Now here we were, years later, headed to the Hamptons estate I shared with my... husband. The word still felt strange, even in my thoughts.
"Ruby..." I started, but she was on a roll.

"No. Summer, listen! Scarlett and I have had enough of watching these people hurt you. Just because they're your family doesn't give them the right to treat you like this! If it wvere me, I'd make sure they couldn't show their faces on Wall Street ever again!"
"Oh please," I couldn't help smiling despite the serious subject. "Remember when that guy stole your coffee in college? You ranted for hours but never actually confronted him!"
"That was different!" Ruby huffed, "I was saving my energy for more important battles!"

 A sleek, modified sports car suddenly roared past us, cutting so close I had to swerve slightly. The driver leaned out his window, waving mockingly before accelerating away. "What the hell?" Ruby surged forward between the front seats. "Who does that jerk think he is? Summer, catch up to him!"

"No way!" I kept my grip steady on the wheel. "I'm not that good a driver,and besides,we're almost there. No point picking fights with strangers."

"But didn't you see how smug he looked?" Ruby's voice rose with indignation.

"Maybe I was in his way?" I suggested mildly.

"You..." Ruby slumped back in her seat. "You're impossible! How can you be so calm about everything?"

The Hamptons estate came into view, its elegant facade gleaming in the afternoon sun. Ruby pressed her face against the window like an excited kid.

Ruby's eyes went wide as she took in the collection of luxury cars."Summer, I knew your husband was rich, but this is something else!"
Scarlett observed quietly, always the more practical one. "And look at the grounds - there's not another house in sight. Don't you find it lonely out here?"

"It is pretty big," I admitted, leading them toward the house."Here,guest slippers are this way."

The sound of voices from the kitchen made us all pause. A man's playful tone carried clearly: "Brandon, I haven't seen you cook in ages! Don't tell me you're doing all this just for me?"
I watched June lead her friends toward the living room, something warm and unfamiliar stirring in my chest at how naturally she moved through what had once been my solitary domain. The sound of their laughter floating back made the usually empty house feel different - alive in a way it hadn't been before. "Come on, brother, don't be like that! All this food can't just be for... oh." "Well, well," Sean's knowing voice from the doorway broke through my We roundedathe corner to find Dr. Sean grinning like a cat who'd found the cream. "Summer! You're back!" "Hello!" I greeted.

"If you need to be at the hospital, go." Brandon's sharp tone made Sean's grin widen. Then Brandon turned to me, his voice softening instantly: "You're home."

The contrast in his demeanor made something warm unfurl in my chest.

"Hey, Mr. Stark!" Ruby bounced forward before I could stop her."Remember me from last night? I'm Ruby, Summer's friend, and this is Scarlett!"

Brandon acknowledged them with a polite nod. "Welcome."

Brandon took theshopping bags from my hands. "You must be tired.Why don't you show your friends to the living room? Dinner will be ready soon." He turned to Ruby and Scarlett, his usual intimidating presence softening slightly. "Please make yourselves comfortable."
Ruby waved off his concern. "Don't worry about us - we'll take care of ourselves,right Summer?"

I squeezed Brandon's arm gently. "Go finish what you were doing.I'll keep them company."




Brandon's POV
thoughts. "You're really serious about this, aren't you?"

I continued preparing dinner, not bothering to look up. "When have I ever not been serious?"

"Look," his voice lost its usual playful edge. "I probably don't have any right to say this, but... don't let her down, okay? Not when she's finally starting to trust you."

"I know what I'm doing."

Sean's soft laugh held no humor. "You know how it is for people like us on Wall Street. Real feelings? That's rarer than unicorns."

"Sean." I finally turned to face him. "I'm not like you. I've never been like you. You know that."

"Yeah." His expression softened as we heard another burst of laughter from the living room. "You're different. And it looks like she's accepting you-bringing her best friends to meet you? That's a pretty big step."

I studied his face, noting the unusual seriousness in his bearing. "What else?"

He produced a medical report from his jacket. "About the drug they used on your wife last night... I ran the analysis myself. It's a controlled substance, very rare. Victoria wouldn't have access to something like this on her own. She might just be the front for someone else."

"You're sure?" I examined the report carefully. "You doubting my professional skills now?" His mock offense couldn't quite hide his concern. "Just... be careful, okay? Keep Summer safe."I filed the information away for later consideration. "I know." I could hear the laughter spilling from the living room as June's friend Ruby recounted their Columbia days. The usually formal space felt different somehow, warmed by their easy camaraderie and June's soft responses.

"And then Summer actually got the professor to change his mind!" Ruby's enthusiasm carried clearly through the open doorway. "She was so quiet usually,but when she believed in something..."

"Speaking of belief," Sean's voice held that particular note of mischief that usually-preceded trouble, "what's got three beautiful ladies laughing so hard?"

"This Dr. Sean Sullivan." June introduced.

"Please, call me Sean." His natural charm shifted smoothly into place."Though I have to ask - was that you in the Porsche earlier? The one that wouldn't race?"

Ruby's voice sharpened with recognition. "Wait, that fancy sports car outside is yours? So you were the one trying to provoke us?"

"Ah, about that..." Even without looking, I could picture Sean's sheepish expression. "I lost that car to Brandon in a bet. Thought he might be driving it and wanted to mess with him a bit. My bad!"

"The commute to the office is pretty far," June explained, and I could hear the smile in her voice. My fingers paused briefly in their work,remembering how naturally she'd adapted to driving the Porsche. I smiled at his concern, nodding in acceptance while adjusting the heat."Okay. But what exactly was I drugged with? I can't remember anything about it." My brain finally caught up with the events of the past twenty-four hours."Wait... Victoria..." "Just a misunderstanding then." The soft rustle of movement suggested June rising. "I should go help Brandon with the dinner!" I frowned, turning the burner to low as instructed, Something wasn't quite right with this whole scenario.
###Chapter 74: Victoria's Scandal

**Summer's POV**

I slipped quietly into the gleaming kitchen, pausing at the threshold to take in the unexpected sight. Brandon stood at the stove, his movements precise and efficient as he tossed ingredients into a sizzling pan.

He sensed my presence without turning, his hands never stopping their work. After a moment, he glanced over his shoulder, dark eyes finding mine with unerring accuracy. "Why aren't you sitting with your friends?"

"We're all just sitting there while you're doing all the work," I replied,stepping further into the kitchen. My eyes tracked his movements, noticing how methodical he was even with something as mundane as cooking.Each motion was deliberate, nothing wasted. "Need any help?"

His hands paused briefly over the pan, and I caught the slight lift of his eyebrow before he nodded. "Check the soup. I had it on high heat earlier.Turn it down to low now."

"Sure." I moved to the stove, lifting the lid of a large pot. An incredible aroma wafted up, making my stomach rumble appreciatively. "Wow, that smells amazing. What kind of soup is this?"

"Bone broth," Brandon replied, his attention back on the vegetables he was sautéing. "You were drugged yesterday. There's likely still some residue in your system. The soup will help flush it out." I returned to the living room to find Ruby and Dr. Sean setting up what looked like an intense card game, with Scarlett observing from the sidelines. "Full house!" Ruby declared triumphantly, laying down her cards. Dr. Sean's smile widened as he revealed his own hand. "Four of a kind.I believe that's another win for me." on's face for clues.
Brandon raised an eyebrow, looking almost amused by my question. "You're awfully slow on the uptake. Only now you're asking?"
"Well, you did say I was drugged," I reminded him, biting my lip. "My brain's still a bit foggy."
After adjusting the heat under the soup, I leaned against the counter,watching Brandon work. There was something hypnotic about his movements - the careful precision, the fluid grace. Even doing something as ordinary as cooking, he commanded attention.
I tapped my fingers against the countertop, mimicking his characteristic gesture. "You said you rescued me yesterday. But what about Victoria?With her personality, if she didn't get what she wanted, she'd definitely come after me again. But it's been a whole day with no news from her."
Brandon's lips curved slightly, a dangerous half-smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "Isn't that a good thing? Or do you actually enjoy being tormented by her?"

"That's not what I meant!" I protested, feeling heat creep into my cheeks.

"You should go rest," he said smoothly, effectively changing the subject. "I can handle this. And stop worrying about them. They can't hurt you anymore." Ruby's jaw dropped in disbelief. "How? That's, like,the fifth time in a row!"

Scarlett sat nearby, watching their competition with barely concealed amusement. Her own face was suspiciously free of the paper strips that covered Ruby's forehead and cheeks -remnants of our college drinking game that Ruby had apparently revived for this occasion.

"That's it!" Ruby finaly exclaimed, throwing her cards down in frustration."You're cheating! There's no way you could win every single round!"

Dr. Sean raised an eyebrow, looking comically innocent. "Miss Scott, I'm playing completely fair. It's hardly my fault if your poker skills aren't quite up to par."

"You..." Ruby bristled, then ripped the paper strips from her face with a dramatic flourish. "I'm done. I quit!"
Dr. Sean spread his hands in a placating gesture. "A true gentleman never pushes a lady too far." But the twinkle in his eyes betrayed his enjoyment of her frustration.

Ruby huffed,grabbing the remote control and switching on the television,clearly looking for a distraction from her defeat. She flipped through several channels before coming to an abrupt stop, her expression shifting from annoyance to shock.

"Holy shit!" she exclaimed, turning up the volume. "Summer, isn't that your sister?" On screen, Victoria's usually perfect composure was nowhere to be seen.Her face was twisted with panic as she fled from a crowd of reporters,their questions overlapping in an unintelligible cacophony. The headline at the bottom of the screen read: "Rising Star Victoria Taylor's Career Built on Casting Couch Scandals?"7% "What the hell?" Ruby breathed, already pulling out her phone to search for more information. "Talk about karma!"
Scarlett leaned forward, eyes wide with disbelief as she read over Ruby's shoulder. "Oh my god, it's everywhere. Every entertainment site has this as their lead story."
Dr. Sean watched their reactions with keen interest, his eyes narrowing slightly as they flicked toward the kitchen. Something in his expression suggested he wasn't entirely surprised by this turn of events.
Ruby scrolled through her phone, reading aloud: "Victoria Taylor,recently engaged to Alexander Stark, has been exposed for systematically sleeping her way to the top... Multiple sources confirm... Photos show her leaving director Jonathan Miller's hotel room at 3 AM..." She looked up,incredulous. "There are pictures! Actual pictures!"
"No wonder Summer could never win against her," Scarlett said quietly."Victoria's been playing a completely different game all along."
My eyes widened, and I had to reread them to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. "When did this happen?"
Ruby's expression turned triumphant. "Just today! The entertainment industry can be brutal - one minute you're on top, the next you're being destroyed on every platform. Look, it's been what, a few hours? And Victoria's already trending on Twitter, Instagram, everywhere!"
"I had no idea Victoria was this... calculating," Scarlett added, her normally gentle voice hardened with disapproval. "Who broke the story?" I asked, scrolling through article after article. Each one seemed more damning than the last, with quotes from "inside sources"detailing Victoria's manipulative climb through Hollywood. Ruby shrugged,""No idea. Twitter's full of people claiming they always knew she was fake, Apparently, she's made a lot of enemies along the way- sabotaging other actresses, spreading rumors. Maybe one of her victims finally decided to get even."




"Are you crazy?" Ruby snatched the phone from my hands before I could dial. "What are you thinking? Victoria brought this on herself! If you call the Taylors now, what do you think they'll assume? That youI're gloating?That you're behind this somehow?"
"Miss Scott is absolutely right," Dr. Sean chimed in, his expression uncharacteristically serious. "The entertainment industry is a complex ecosystem. As outsiders, it's best if we stay clear of the fallout."
"Exactly!" Ruby nodded vigorously. "Victoria's been playing dirty for years.There must be dozens of people who'd love to see her fall. Consider this cosmic justice - she's finally getting what she deserves for how she's treated you."
Brandon appeared in the doorway, carrying a large serving platter. "Dinner's ready.Come eat."
"Great!" I smiled gratefully, tucking my phone away and letting the subject drop.As we headed to the dining room, I couldn't help wondering what Brandon thought about Victoria's sudden public downfa11. His face had revealed nothing, but something in the calculating depth of his eyes made me wonder if he knew more than he was letting on. After all, nothing in Brandon Stark's world happened by coincidence - especially not when it involved someone who had harmed me.
###Chapter 75: Seeking the Starks' Help


**Victoria's POV**
My trembling fingers scrolled through yet another scathing headline:"Victoria Taylor: Hollywood's Newest Fraud Exposed!" I threw my phone across the bedroom, watching with grim satisfaction as it bounced off my silk pillows. The sound wasn't nearly as satisfying as glass shattering against the wall-like the vase I'd destroyed yesterday, or the crystal decanter from the day before.
"Miss Victoria?" A timid knock at the door. "Would you like some breakfast?"
"Get the fuck away from my door!" I screamed, hurling a designer shoe at the wooden panel. The thud was followed by hurried footsteps retreating down the hall.
I collapsed onto my bed, curling into a fetal position as tears burned behind my eyelids.

My phone buzzed again from somewhere in the bedding.

And those photos... God, those photos. The ones my PR team had assured me were destroyed years ago. I'd been young, desperate, and stupid. Now they were everywhere.
I scrolled through my contacts, desperate for anyone who might help. My agent's calls went straight to voicemail after he'd delivered the news yesterday: "Take some time off, Victoria. We'll reassess when this blows over." Translation: you're toxic, and we're cutting you loose.

 "This is fucking insane," I whispered to my empty room, voice cracking from hours of screaming and crying. "Who would do this to me?"

 My phone buzzed with an email notification: *Dear Ms. Taylor,*
*In light of recent events, Luminous Cosmetics regrets to inform you that we must terminate our contract effective immediately. As per section 12.3of our agreement regarding moral turpitude clauses...*
I didn't bother reading the rest. That was the fifth brand to drop me in three days.
A sob tore from my throat as I hurled my phone at the mirror, watching my reflection splinter into a thousand pieces. The crash brought an immediate pounding on my door.
"Victoria!" My mother's voice, sharp with concern. "Open this door right now!"

"Go away!" I screamed back, my voice raw.

"Victoria, darling, please!" The doorknob rattled.

I collapsed onto the floor amidst the shattered glass, too exhausted to fight anymore. "It's open," I finally called out.
Mom rushed in, her perfectly manicured hand flying to her mouth at the sight of me surrounded by broken glass. "Oh my God, Victoria! What have you done?"
"What have *I* done?" I laughed bitterly. "I didn't do anything! Someone is trying to destroy me!" Her eyes swept over the destruction of my room-the overturned furniture,shattered glass, clothes strewn everywhere. For three days, I'd refused to let the staff clean, preferring to wallow in the physical manifestation of my ruined life. "You can't stay like this," she said firmly, stepping carefully through the debris. "Look at yourself."
I caught a glimpse in what remained of my mirror-mascara streaked down hollow cheeks, unwashed hair clinging to my scalp, designer pajamas wrinkled and stained. I barely recognized myself.
Mom's face twisted with a mixture of heartbreak and frustration. "How long are you going to keep acting like this? Look at yourself!" She gestured wildly at my disheveled appearance. "You've barely eaten anything for two days. You break whatever the staff brings you. What's the point of all this?
"1
The concern in her voice broke through the numbness that had been my only protection. Tears welled up and spilled over before I could stop them.
"But Mom, what am I supposed to do? My career is over!" The words caught in my throat, choking me. "The agency says I should 'take a break,'but I know they're just dumping me. All those brands are canceling my contracts." My voice cracked with desperation. "Mom, who would do this to me?"
"I worked so hard to become a star," I whispered, clutching at her sleeves like a child. "I can't let my career end like this! Mom, please help me!"
I watched her face closely, panic rising as I saw the uncertainty in her eyes.Mom's brow furrowed as she seemed to mentally sort through her options.For the first time, I realized she might not have an immediate answer.The thought was terrifying. "Mom, don't you love me anymore?" The words came out childish and desperate. "Are you just going to watch while someone destroys me?" Her expression hardened at that, her spine straightening. "How could you say that? Of course I love you!" She pulled me into her arms, stroking my tangled hair..05You're my only daughter that matters.I'd do anything for you. There is a solution, but..."

Hope flared in my chest, bright and desperate. "But what?" I grabbed her hands, squeezing them tightly. "Mom, I knew you'd have a plan. What is it?"

Mom's eyes met mine, calculating. "What about Alexander? Have you forgotten him?"

"Alexander?" The name felt strange on my tongue. In the chaos of the past few days, I'd barely thought about my fiancé.
*Oh God, Alexander.* Had he seen the headlines? The photos? The accusations? Panic clawed at my throat. What if the Stark family decided I was too much of a liability? The engagement had never just been about love-it was a business arrangement too, a way to secure my family's standing with my shares in Capital Corp.
My fingers dug into Mom's arms with bruising force, my nails leaving half-moon imprints in her skin. She winced, drawing in a sharp breath.

"Victoria! What are you doing?" Her voice was tight with pain.

I released her immediately, summoning the expression that had won me my first movie role-wide eyes, trembling lower lip, the perfect picture of vulnerability. "Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. It's just...Alexander hasn't even called to check on me.I..." Mom's expression suddenly shifted, the slight narrowing of her eyes indicating she'd just had an idea. "Do you remember that important guest at your grandfather's birthday party?" The question seemed odd, disconnected from our conversation. "Mom, you mean...Brandon Stark?" "Exactly." Her eyes gleamed wih purpose. "Isn't Alexander related to Brandon? If Brandon Stark helps us, your problems will disappear overnight!"
But I remembered our last encounter-how he'd looked straight through me, pretending not to even know who I was. The memory stung. My brief moment of hope deflated.
"But that Brandon Stark is so awful," I began, the complaint automatic. "He-"
"Do you want to salvage your career or not?" Mom cut me off sharply,her voice like a whip.

I flinched at her tone.
"If you want to stay in Hollywood, sometimes you need to swallow your pride," she continued, her eyes hard. "Besides, if our family connects with Brandon Stark, your father wouldn't need to beg the Windsors for anything."
I knew what she wasn't saying. The Windsors had pulled their investment after that disaster with Summer at Grandpa's birthday party. No one on Wall Street would touch Taylor family businesses now. Dad had been locked in his study for days, making desperate calls to save Capital Corp.

But still...Brandon Stark? The man intimidated me in a way few people ever had. There was something in those cold eyes that made me feel transparent, like he could see through every calculated move I'd ever made. If he'd been so dismissive before, why would he help me now? Unless...Alexander could convince him. After all,they were family,even if distant. I needed to believe this would work. "Alexander and Brandon must be
close. right? Alexander and Brandon will definitely help me!"

Mom's smile was triumphant. "Of course he will. You're gorgeous, darling.Any man would fall for you!"
###Chapter 76: You're Both Starks

**Victoria's POV**

Taking a deep breath, I dialed Alexander's number.

Alexander picked up on the fourth ring, his voice distracted. "Hello?"

"Alex, are you busy?" I made sure my tone was light and airy, with just the right touch of sweetness.

There was a pause. "Um, yes, I have some work. What's up?"

Perfect opportunity. "I'm actually right outside Fortune Corp! I brought lunch for you," I glanced down at the empty space beside me where an imaginary lunch would be. *I'll pick something up on the way.* "Can I come up and see you?"

"Victoria..." He sounded exhausted. "I'm in the middle of something-"

"Alex," I injected a slight tremble into my voice, "I know this week has been crazy. I've been... struggling. Ijust need to see you, even for a minute."I bit my lower lip hard enough to make my eyes water, though of course he couldn't see that through the phone. The emotion in my voice was real enough,though.

He sighed heavily. "Fine. You can come up."

"You're the best! I'll be there in twenty." I hung up before he could change his mind. I walked through the imposing glass doors of Fortune Corp, holding a perfectly arranged meal in an elegant white box. The security guard recognized me immediately - not surprising, given how often my face had been splashed across entertainment news this week. "Miss Taylor," he nodded, trying not to stare.

As I waited for the elevator, I became acutely aware of the whispers around me. Office workers pretended to be occupied with their phones while stealing glances in my direction.

"That's her-Victoria Taylor..."

"Didn't you see the photos? She totally slept her way..."

"I heard she sabotaged that actress from the Netflix show..."

My fingers tightened around the lunch box handle until my knuckles turned white. *Fucking vultures.*

The elevator doors opened, revealing a mercifully empty car. I stepped inside, my smile dropping the instant the doors closed. *Just breathe,
Victoria. Remember why you're here.

Alexander was hunched over his desk when I entered, surrounded by stacks of papers. His usually immaculate appearance was slightly rumpled - tie loosened, hair mussed as if he'd been running his hands through it repeatedly. He glanced up briefly as I walked in.

"Alex!" I infused my voice with warmth. "Look what I brought you!"I held up the Jean-Georges bag.

He barely looked at it. "You can set it down. I need to finish these reports first." "Sure!" I studied him as he worked, noting the dark circles under his eyes and the tension in his shoulders. The scandal had hit him too,though not nearly as hard as me. The Stark name had shielded him somewhat, but I'd heard whispers that his family was pressuring him to reconsider our engagement. *Not a chance." I needed this marriage more than ever now. The Taylor name had taken enough hits lately- I needed the stability and protection of becoming a Stark.

After fifteen excruciating minutes. Alexander finally closed the file he'd been reviewing andI set down his pen with deliberate precision.

I leapt to my feet immediately, rushing over to the side table to pour him a glass of water from the crystal decanter. I handed it to him with a demure smile, then grabbed a tissue from the box on his desk and offered it to him.

"Here,wipe your hands before you eat," I said, already unpacking the gourmet lunch. The containers released mouthwatering aromas as I arranged everything perfectly, setting out the silverware with practiced grace.

"Alex, you must be starving," I smiled warmly. "I specifically ordered from Jean-Georges-your favorite!"

Alexander's gaze sharpened, a slight frown creasing his brow as he looked from the food to me.

My heart skipped uncomfortably. "What? Don't you like it? Is something wrong?"

He shook his head slowly. "No, it's fine. I'm just surprised to see you here,that's all. You usually avoid office visits- something about paparazzi and being photographed in the same outfit twice," *Shit.* I'd forgotten I'd used that excuse before. I forced alight laugh.11People change, don't they? Can't a girl do something nice for her fiancé?" I leaned forward slightly, letting my blouse gap just enough to be distracting. "Don't you like me being thoughtful?" Alexander's eyes didn't drop to my cleavage as expected. Instead, he maintained uncomfortable eye contact. "Of course I do. Thank you."

He picked up a fork and took a small bite. "How are you feeling? Better today?”

This was my opening. I lowered my eyes, letting vulnerability show on my face. "Alex," I began softly, wringing my hands in my lap. "You love me.don't you?"

His hand paused halfway to his mouth, his expression guarded. "Yes. Why do you ask?"

I reached across the table, grasping his free hand between both of mine.I could feel him tense at the contact, but I held on tighter. "Alex, if you love me, you'll help me, right? I have nowhere else to turn. I'm *begging* you."

Alexander set down his fork with a soft clink, his appetite visibly gone. "What exactly do you want me to do, Victoria?"

*Here goes nothing.*

"You're close with Brandon, aren't you? You're both Starks!"I leaned forward eagerly. "That man who gave Grandpa that priceless chess set at his birthday party. He's incredibly influential, isn't he? I heard he owns a media company. Could you possibly..."

Alexander's expression darkened, his jaw tightening visibly. He pulled his hand from my grasp.I didn't notice his reaction, too caught up in my desperate plan. "Alex, you and Brandon Stark are relatives, right? Couldn't you ask him to help me weather this storm? Just one word from him, and I could make a comeback in the entertainment industry. Alex, I know you care about me.Please help me!" "But-" Alexander started, his voice tight.

"But what?" I didn't let him finish, switching to my most vulnerable expression-wide eyes, slightly trembling lower lip. "Don't you want to help me? I know I brought some of this on myself. But those photos and stories-they're mostly taken out of context! Yes, I had some conflicts with production teams, but that was just me fighting for better roles! I haven't done anything truly terrible. Someone's clearlyout to get me. Alex, please!"

Alexander looked genuinely pained. "I..."

Before he could finish, the door swung open. Alexander's father strode in confidently, his sharp eyes taking in the scene instantly.

"This matter is settled," he announced without preamble. "Alex will speak with Brandon about this!"

"Dad-" Alexander tried to interject.

His father silenced him with a stern look. "Victoria, don't worry about a thing. Alex will help you. And I'm certain Brandon will offer his assistance as well!"

"But Dad," Alexander protested weakly. "Brandon and I aren't exactly-"

"She's your fiancée," his father cut in harshly. "Her reputation affects our family name now. Besides, I'm sure Victoría is the victim of a smear campaign. What kind of man stands by while his future wife is attacked?The decision is made." I could have kissed the old man. Instead, I gave him my most grateful smile. "Thank you so mauch, sir. I really appreciate your support."*Perfect. With old Mr. Stark on my side, Alexander would have to help me. And once Brandon Stark got involved, my problems would disappear overnight. I'd be back on magazine covers in no time. Everything was going according to plan
###Chapter 77: Victoria's Lifeline

**Brandon's POV**

My hand paused mid-signature as I heard the expected footsteps approaching my office. I glanced up, a small smile playing at my lips. "He's here already? Sooner than I anticipated."

"Sir, your foresight continues to amaze me," James remarked,standing at attention by my desk. "Though I must admit, I'm surprised Alexander actually had the nerve to show up"

I allowed myself a brief, cold smile. "Even if his pride objects, his father would find a way to make him come."

James nodded, understanding perfectly. "And now, sir?"

"Send him up." I signed the last document with a flourish. "And make sure the team knows I'ma only giving them one year on this project. The first phase needs to launch immediately."

"Of course, sir." James collected the papers efficiently. "I'll have him sent up right away."

Alexander was escorted to my office by one of the junior assistants, his expression carefully composed though I could see the tension in his shoulders. This was his first time on the executive floor of Stark Tower-a privilege he hadn't earned before and likely wouldn't again. He stepped inside, immediately adopting a smile that didn't reach his eyes."Uncle Brandon." The familial address was a transparent attempt to establish connection-to remind me of our blood ties, distant as they might be. Each syllable seemed to cost him, the forced respect clearly burning his pride.I could almost taste his resentment. "What brings my nephew to visit today?" I asked, my tone deliberately neutral, emphasizing our familial relationship and the implicit power dynamic. Each word was carefully chosen to remind him of his place-beneath me in every hierarchy that mattered.

"Uncle Brandon," he began, the words clearly leaving a bitter taste in his mouth. "Ill be direct. I've come to ask for your assistance with a somewhat delicate matter."

I lifted an eyebrow, feigning interest while inwardly enjoying his discomfort. Every moment in my presence was clearly torture for him-good. After what he'd done to June, this was the least he deserved.

"Go on," I said.

Alexander took a deep breath. "Do you remember George Taylor's birthday celebration a while back?"

I nodded once. "I do." The memory of finding June drugged and vulnerable that night made my jaw tighten imperceptibly. "Why bring that up now?"

"Well, you may have heard that I recently got engaged to Mr. Taylor's granddaughter," he continued, fidgeting slightly. "Victoria Taylor-she was standing beside me that evening. The Taylor family's eldest daughter."

"I see," I responded, my expression revealing nothing while inwardly savoring what was coming. "I don't recall." Alexander's face stiffened noticeably, He clearly hadn't expected such a dismissive response, especially regarding someone as recognizable as Victoria. His confidence wavered visibly,but he pressed on."Victoria works in the entertainment industry," he explained,his voice strained."It2Sa cutthroat business, full of unsavory characters. Recently,she's become the target of a rather vicious online smear campaign. She's the victim here, being attacked by-"

"Get to the point," I interrupted, pinching the bridge of my nose. "What does this have to do with me?"

Alexander straightened, sensing my waning patience. "I know Stark Group owns a film production company. I was hoping you might... help Victoria.These attacks could destroy her career."

"Ah, now I understand." I pressed the intercom button. "James, come in for a moment."

Every cell in my body wanted to throw him out of my office, to make him suffer for how he'd betrayed June. But patience was required here.Victoria's current troubles were just the beginning-I had far more comprehensive plans for both of them.

James entered promptly, nodding politely to Alexander. "You needed me,

sir?"

"We own a film production company, correct?" I asked, though we both knew I was perfectly aware of every asset under my control.

"Yes, sir," James confirmed, seamlessly following my lead. "I've been overseeing it on your behalf." I turned back to Alexander, noting how he struggled to maintain eye contact. Asking for my help clearly cost him his pride, especially given the barely concealed hatred he felt toward me. The fact that his father had forced him into this meeting for Victoria's shares in the Capital Corp made it all the sweeter. "There you have it. James manages our entertainment division. Whatever you need, discuss the details with him. He has my full authority in these matters." The momentaryflash of disappointment on Alexander's face was telling-he'd hoped to establish a direct connection with me, not be pawned off to my assistant. Nevertheless, he recognized the offer for what it was: a grudging concession.

"Thank you, Uncle," he said, each word clearly painful to pronounce. "I appreciate your help."

"Of course," I replied, waving toward the door. "James will take care of everything."

As they left, I allowed myself a small smile. Let Alexander think he'd won a victory-it would make the eventual lesson all the more effective.Let him go back to Victoria with good news, let them celebrate this small reprieve.

After several minutes, James returned alone, his expression hesitant, as though wrestling with an unasked question.

I raised an eyebrow. "Something on your mind?"

James nodded, choosing his words carefully. "I don't quite understand your strategy, sir. We have enough damaging information on Victoria to completely destroy her career. Why offer her a role at all? Why not simply release everything at once and be done with her?"

His confusion was reasonable. James had worked with me long enough to know my usual approach to enemies-swift, decisive, and without mercy.This more measured response clearly puzzled him. I allowed myself a cold smile. "Killing her career outright would be too merciful, don't you think?" I swirled the bourbon in my glass,watching the amber liquid catch the light. "No, I prefer a different approach. Build her up first. Let her climb to the very pinnacle, taste what real success feels like." I leaned back in my chair, setting down the untouched drink. "Then, when she's at her highest point, when she believes herself untouchable... that's when we pull the rug out. The fall from such heights isn't just devastating-it's obliterating. She won't just be ruined; she'll be shattered beyond repair."

James couldn't quite suppress a shiver. "I see,sir."

"Gradually direct our best resources her way," I instructed. "But first,have her terminate her current contracts. I want her fully under our control."

James looked surprised. "You want the production company to sign Victoria Taylor?"

I nodded. "If she craves the spotlight so badly, let's give it to her." My lips curved into a dangerous smile. "Let her learn that being the center of attention can quickly turn into being the target of everyone's disgust."

"But sir, we've only offered her a supporting role. Will she even accept?"

"She will," I said with absolute certainty. "People like Victoria, with that kind of ambition? They never refuse an opportunity, no matter how small.She's desperate now-she'll grab any lifeline we throw her."

"Very well, sir. I'll see to the arrangements."
###Chapter 78: Brandon's Signing Victoria?

**Summer's POV**

"Organic or non-organic?" I held up two perfectly identical bunches of spinach, watching Brandon's expression for guidance. The high-end supermarket's lighting made everything look unnaturally perfect, but I still couldn't teIl the difference between the thirty-dollar greens and their fifteen-dollar counterparts.

Brandon paused his methodical selection of tomatoes to glance over. "Whichever you prefer."

"That's not helpful," I complained, dropping both bunches intoour cart."You're the food expert here. I've been eating takeout for the past three years."

The corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile that never failed to make my pulse skip. "Is that so? I thought Fortune Corp had a company cafeteria."

"Yeah, with food that tastes like cardboard." I wrinkled my nose,wandering over to examine a display of artisanal pastas.

His phone buzzed as we reached the wine section. That familiar crease appeared between his brows as he read the message.

"Problem?" I asked, already recognizing the look. "Just something I need to handle." He tucked the phone away,his expression smoothing over. "I can finish this later." I shook my head firmly. "No need. I'll finish up here. You do what you need to do." Those dark eyes studied my face with that unsettling intensity. "You sure?" "Positive." I gave him a small push toward the exit. "Go handle your business empire. I'll make dinner tonight."

Brandon raised one perfect eyebrow. "You can cook?"

"Don't look so surprised!" I crossed my arms defensively. "I'm not a complete disaster in the kitchen."

His lips twitched with barely suppressed amusement. "I'll look forward to it. But don't overdo it - just one or two dishes is fine."

"Are you worried I'll burn down your fancy kitchen?" I challenged,fighting a smile.

Brandon leaned down, his breath warmn against my ear. "No, I'm worried you'll exhaust yourself trying to impress me."

Heat flooded my cheeks as he straightened up. "Just go already! I'll see you at home."

\---

Three hours later, I surveyed the kitchen with a mix of pride and exhaustion. Despite Brandon's advice, I'd gotten carried away,preparing a spread that could easily feed six people instead of two. My grandmother's recipes had come flooding back once I started cooking - comfort foods that reminded me of happier times. After setting the table, I headed upstairs to find Brandon. His study door stood ajar, but the room was empty. I frowned, checking the time.He'd mentioned having things to handle, but I'd expected him back by now. My attention caught on a folder lying open on his desk - unusual for Brandon, who typically maintained meticulous order in his workspace.Without thinking, I picked it up, my eyes scanning the top page. *Stark Entertainment Group-Talent Contract-Victoria Taylor*

My brow furrowed as I flipped through the pages, each one detailing extensive terms for what appeared to be a significant role at Brandon's entertainment company. A company I hadn't even known he owned.

"Find something interesting?"

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the folder dropping from my hands.Brandon stood in the doorway, his expression unreadable as he approached.

"Ask whatever you want to ask." His voice was surprisingly gentle as he retrieved the fallen documents.

I swallowed hard, organizing my thoughts. "You're signing Victoria? I mean. I didn't even know you had an entertainment company."

Brandon slipped the papers from my fingers, his thumb brushing against my wrist in a touch that seemed more deliberate than accidental. "Is that what you came up here for? To snoop through my business affairs?"

"No! I came to tell you dinner's ready." I felt heat creeping up my neck. "The documents were just... there."

"I see." His dark eyes held mine for a long moment. "Ready to head down?

"

I nodded, then hesitated. "If you don't want to tell me about it, that's fine."

 Brandon's unexpected laugh caught me off guard. His hand  reached out,fingers ruffling my hair with casual intimacy."Hey!" I protested, trying to smooth the sudden disarray. "Don't mess up my hair!" His expression softened with something that looked suspiciously like affection. "You know, for someone who's usually so even-tempered, you can be quite rebellious."

"I'm not being rebellious," I huffed, still attempting to fix my hair."And that's not even the right word. Do you even know how to use vocabulary properly?"

"Apparently not," he conceded, though the amusement in his eyes belied any real contrition.

As we headed toward the stairs, Brandon's hand found mine, our fingers intertwining with a naturalness that still surprised me.

"About that entertainment company," he said casually. "It was an investment from a few years back. James and his team handle the day-to-day operations. I rarely get involved directly."

I glanced up at him, curiosity piqued. "So why are you getting involved with Victoria?"

His grip tightened slightly. "Alexander came to see me. Victoria sent him to ask for my help."

A strange conflict churned inside me~ deep down, I trusted Brandon,believed in the connection we'd built these past weeks. The safety and care he'd shown me were real; that much I knew with certainty. But Victoria had been tormenting me for years, had nearly gotten me assaulted at Grandpa's party, had stolen my fiancé and tried to drug me. Why would Brandon, who'd protected me from all that, suddenly extend a helping hand to the person who'd caused me so much pain? It didn't make sense. "And you said yes?" I couldn't keep the disbelief from my voice. "You know what she did to me, yet you're helping her?"
###Chapter 79: A Stroke of Anger

**Summer's POV**

Brandon's thumb traced a soothing pattern across my knuckles. "Trust me.Let's eat first- I have something to show you later."

The spread I'd prepared covered almost the entire dining table-roasted vegetables, pan-seared fish, pasta with homemade sauce, a fresh salad, and even a small dessert.

Brandon paused at the doorway, one eyebrow lifting. "I thought I said one or two dishes."

I bit my lip, suddenly uncertain. "Is it too much? I..."

"It looks incredible," he said,his voice softening. "Thank you."

As we settled at the table, I couldn't hold back anymore. "The Victoria scandal was your doing, wasn't it?"

Brandon's hand stilled momentarily as he reached for his water glass.Then his lips curved into that dangerous half-smile.

"I couldn't just stand by and do nothing," he admitted. "You're my wife.When someone hurts you, they deal with me. That's how it works."

Something warm unfurled in my chest at his straightforward declaration."But why help her now? And why would Alexander even come to you?From what I know about him, he's too proud. He never seemed to like you much, even though you're both Starks." "My wife is quite perceptive." Brandon nodded approvingly. "You're right about Alexander. We've never been close - different branches of the family,different circumstances growing up." His expression turned contemplative."But Victoria'sshares in Capital Corp are valuable enough for Alexander to
set aside his ego. And his father is particularly ambitious."

I nodded slowy, absorbing his explanation. "I understand. Do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment."

Brandon shifted closer, taking my hand and placing it on his knee. His fingers gently tilted my face toward his, until we were barely inches apart.My heart hammered against my ribs as I instinctively tried to look away,but he held me steady.

"Trust me?" he asked, his voice dropping to that velvet-soft tone.

I nodded, unable to form words with him so close. "I do."

His smile widened slightly, genuine warmth replacing his usual reserve."
Good. Now let's eat before all your hard work gets cold."

Dinner passed pleasantly, with Brandon complimenting each dish in his understated way. When I stood to clear the plates, he caught my wrist.
"Ill handle this. Household duties should be shared between spouses, don't you think?"

I blinked in surprise, not expecting such domestic equality from someone like Brandon Stark. Warmth spread through me as I watched him efficiently stack the dishes and carry them to the kitchen.

My phone's sudden ring shattered the peaceful moment. Elizabeth's name flashed across the screen, making my stomach twist with instinctive dread.

 "Summer, come to the hospital immediately!" Her sharp voice carried its usual note of displeasure. I gripped the phone tighter, instantly alert. "What's happened?" "You have the nerve to ask what happened?" Elizabeth's voice rose with accusation. "You don't even call when your sister's career is falling apart, My mind latched onto the important information, ignoring her barbs. "Wait, what did you say? Grandpa's sick? What happened to him?"
"It's all your fault!" Elizabeth's fury crackled through the connection."What did you say to him? How did you manipulate him to wrap him around your finger? You-"

"ENOUGH!" I rarely raised my voice, but fear for my grandfather overrode everything else. "Which hospital is he in? I'm coming right now!"

There was a startled silence before Elizabeth finally answered. "Manhattan General."

I ended the call, my hands already searching for my purse and car keys.Brandon emerged from the kitchen, immediately alert to my distress.

"What's happened?" His voice was calm but focused.

"My grandfather's in the hospital." My voice cracked slightly. "I have to go see him."

Without hesitation, Brandon reached for his jacket. "Give me a minute.I'll come with you."

"No." I shook my head firmly. "It's better if you don't. If the Taylor family sees you with me right now, it'll just complicate things. Apparently they've had a fight with Grandpa abou t the stock transfer. I need to handle this myself." Something flickered in Brandon's dark eyes. "Then I definitely should be there," "But-"1hesitated,suddenly imagining Brandon getting tangled in the

Taylor family web the way Charles Windsor had. The thought made me shudder.

"No more buts." His tone brooked no argument. "I'll drive you there and wait downstairs. I won't intrude, but I'll be nearby if you need me."

Before I could protest further, he had taken the keys from my hand and was guiding me toward the garage. The decisive way he bundled me into the passenger seat of his car should have felt controlling, but instead, it was oddly comforting. In crisis, Brandon acted quickly and decisively-a trait I was becoming increasingly grateful for.

The drive to Manhattan was mostly silent, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios. Had Grandpa George collapsed? Had his heart given out? The thought of losing one of the few people who had always loved me unconditionally made my throat tighten with panic.

When we pulled into the hospital parking lot, Brandon found a spot in a secluded corner, away from the main entrance.

"June." His voice pulled me from my spiraling thoughts as I reached for the door handle.

"What is it?" I couldn't keep the impatience from my voice, every second feeling crucial.
Brandon reached over, his hand covering mine with reassuring pressure."Be careful in there. If anything happens-anything at all-call me immediately. Remember, I've got your back. Always:" Unexpected warmth bloomed in my chest despite the circumstances."Thank you. Brandon, when Grandpa's better... I want you to meet him properly." A slight smile curved his lips as he brushed a strand of hair from my face."I thought you'd want me to meet your maternal grandfather first." I paused, confused by the comment. "Why?"

He shook his head. "Go. Your grandfather needs you."

"Okay." With a quick nod, I hurried toward the entrance, his promise of support giving me the courage to face whatever waited inside.

Outside the treatment area, I spotted the Taylor family clustered together-Richard pacing anxiously, Victoria sitting with perfect posture despite her worried expression, and Elizabeth gesticulating wildly as she spoke to a nurse.

The moment Elizabeth saw me, her face contorted with rage. Before I could ask about Grandpa's condition, she stormed over and slapped me hard across the face.

"You worthless girl! Look what you've done!" she screamed, her voice echoing through the waiting area. "You've given your grandfather a stroke with your selfishness!"

I stood frozen, my hand rising to my stinging cheek as I tried to process her words. "I don't understand. How is Grandpa? What happened to him?"

Elizabeth's face turned an alarming shade of red. "Don't pretend you don't know! How did you convince him to transfer all his Capital Corp stocks to you? You ungrateful little snake - what more do you want from this family?"

She raised her hand to strike me again, but this time I caught her wrist mid-air, something cold and hard settling in my chest. I pushed her hand away firmly. "Whether Grandpa gave me stocks ornot is between him and me. What right do you have to fight with him about it?Don't think I don't know what you've been doing to him all these years." I stepped forward, forcing Elizabeth to back up. "I don't have time for this right now. Get out of my way. I need to see my grandfather."
###Chapter 80: Bit by Bit

**Summer's POV**

Elizabeth lost her balance, teetering dangerously on her high heels.Alexander rushed forward, catching her elbow just before she toppled over.

"Summer, what the hell!" Alexander snapped. "Apologize to Elizabeth right now!"

"Apologize? Seriously?" I scoffed. "Grandpa's fighting for his life in there,and you're all out here pointing fingers at me? When he wakes up, we'll see who really sent him to the hospital."

I walked away, needing space from their toxic energy. The only thing that mattered right now was Grandpa George.

Victoria's voice carried across the waiting room.

"Mom, cool it," she said loudly. "Summer's worried too.And Alex,she's just upset, cut her some slack."

*Classic Victoria*, I thought. Her talent for playing the peacemaker when others were watching was so predictable it was almost funny.

She sidled up to me with practiced grace. "Summer, you okay?"

I just stared at her, taking in the calculated concern in her eyes. Behind her, Elizabeth and Alexander watched our interaction like hawks. "Looks, I know you're still mad at me," Victoria continued, her voice honey-sweet. "But Grandpa's sick. What's so bad between sisters that we can't just get over it? I was wrong before. Can't we just move past everything for Grandpa's sake?" I almost snorted at how transparent she was. Victoria hadn't suddenly grown a conscience-she wanted something. "You're right, sister." I replied flatly. "Since Grandpa's sick, let's not discuss anything else. I need some space right now."

Victoria's eyes narrowed, but she pressed on. "Summer, do you know why Grandpa had a stroke?"


I just stared at her.

Her perfect mask slipped slightly as the silence stretched. "Summer, did Grandpa-"


The operating room doors swung open, interrupting her. A tired-looking surgeon emerged.

"Family of George Taylor?" he asked.

I rushed forward. "I'm his granddaughter, Summer Taylor."

"Your grandfather is stable for now," the doctor said. "We've relieved the pressure on his brain, but he's not out of danger yet."

"Will he be okay?" My voice cracked.

"He's temporarily out of danger, but at his age, this kind of stress is extremely risky. Whatever triggered this can't happen again."

I nodded quickly. "Of course. How is he now?" "Still unconscious. We're moving him to ICU for the night. If he wakes up tomorrow, that's a good sign." The doctor glanced at my family, who hadn't moved an inch. "Go handle billing. No need to crowd here. The patient needs complete rest tonight." "Thank God. Thank you, doctor," I said, relief washing over me. "Just doing my job." He gave me a small smile before walking away. I rumed to leave,but Victoria grabbed my arm.

"Summer, we need to talk." she insisted.

I yanked my arm free. There's nothing to talk about. Since we can't stay with Grandpa. I'm going home. I'll be back tomorrow."

Elizabeth's voice cut through the hallway. "Summer! Stop right there!

I ignored her and kept walking. Before I could reach the elevator.Elizabeth grabbed me so hard I nearly fell.

"What now?" I snapped.

You're not going anywhere until you tell us the truth!" Elizabeth hissed."Did you manipulate your grandfather into giving you those Capital Corp shares?


*Unbelievable. That's all they care about.*

"Manipulate? Seriously?" I stared at her in disbelief.


"Don't play dumb." Elizabeth snapped. "He's getting oldand you saw an opportunity. You've been buttering him up while ignoring the rest of us. It's obvious you just want his shares."

Something inside me finally broke. Years of seeking approval, making excuses for their behavior, hoping things might change-all of it suddenly felt pathetic.

"Wow. You think I fake-love Grandpa for his money?" I asked, my voice eerily calm.


"I always thought you disliked me because I'd done something wrong," I continued. "But the problem was never me-it's you. All of you. I care about Grandpa because he's my grandfather, not his damn shares." Elizabeth's face hardened. "Fine. If that's true, give the shares to Victoria.I'Il even start being a good mother to you!"

I laughed harshly. "Are you serious right now?"

I looked at Richard and Alexander, seeing the same calculating expressions on all their faces.
"If you want the shares so badly, let Grandpa decide when he wakes up.But right now, whether I have them or not, you're getting nothing from me."

Elizabeth raised her hand to slap me again. "You ungrateful-"

I shoved her away. "Three strikes and you're out, Mother. I'm a person with feelings too, but they're not infinite. You've been wearing them down bit by bit for years. And when they're gone, they're really gone."

I walked away, feeling strangely liberated. The last thread of obligation I'd felt toward my parents had finally snapped.

I walked aimlessly through Manhattan's streets, barely registering the crowds or the noise. My mind was empty, my body moving on autopilot.I didn't even notice the car following slowly behind me until I found myself in a small park, the concrete paths winding between carefully manicured shrubs. Headlights suddenly illuminated the path in front of me. I turned,momentarily blinded by the brightness, but I recognized the sleek silhouette of Brandon's car immediately. Something warm stirred in my chest, melting the ice that had formed there. My eyes began to sting with unshed tears as I quickened my pace toward him. Brandon lowered the window, his dark eyes taking in my disheveled appearance and red-rimmed eyes. He didn't ask questions, didn't demand explanations. "Get in," he said simply.

Those two words-so direct, so Brandon-felt like a lifeline thrown to someone drowning. My hand rested on the door handle, squeezing it tightly as I made a decision.

Instead of opening the door, I leaned through the window, cupping Brandon's face between my cold hands. Without overthinking it, I pressed my lips against his in a desperate, searching kiss. It wasn't skilled or practiced-it was raw and needy, a desperate attempt to find shelter from the storm inside me.

Brandon's hands came up to cradle the back of my head, deepening the kiss.
###Chapter 81: No Going Back

Summer's POV**
Brandon's lips moved against mine with a gentleness that contradicted everything I knew about him. My hands trembled as they found their way to his shoulders, uncertain at first, then growing bolder as he deepened the

When we finally pulled apart. I was breathless, clinging to his neck as my forehead rested against his. My heart hammered against my ribs.
I-sank into his embrace, my hands pressed against him ear a ars heart. The steady rhythm grounded me when everything else felt like
spinning out of comrol.

"You're bleeding," I murmured, noticing the small cut at the corner of his


captured my hand when I reached to touch it. "It's nothing."

en't you asdeg me what happened?

The comer of his mow.h lifte d in that dange rouhalf-smile. You'll tell me
when you're ready.
His thumb traced my cheek, his expression darkening slightly. "They hit you."
My body tensed as the scene at the hospital flashed through my mind-Elizabeth's rage, her handprint still burning on my skin. Brandon leaned down, placing a gentle kiss on my reddened cheek. "You don't have to carry everything alone," he said quietly. "You're not alone anymore. You have me." I lcoked up at him: "Can we go now? I'm exhausted." "Of course. Let's go home."

*Home.* The word hit me harder than I expected.

"Get some sleep when we get back," he continued. "Whatever happened,we can deal with it tomorrow."

"I don't think I can sleep," I admitted. "I'd rather just talk. That okay?"

Brandon's expression softened. "Of course."

As we drove toward the Hamptons, I found myself watching Brandon's profile.

"They found out Grandpa George transferred his Capital Corp shares to me," I finally said. "They think I manipulated him into it. That's why he had the stroke- they confronted him."

Brandon nodded slightly. "That was expected. Your father won't be in control as long as George is alive. Him wanting those shares is natural."His voice was calm. "What happened next?"

"Grandpa's in the ICU." My voice cracked. "They don't know if he'll wake up tomorrow. And now that they know about theshares,they won't leave me alone."

I stared out at the passing streetlights. "I always thought if I just kept giving in, things would never reach a breaking point. But today I realized it doesn't matter how much I give up - they'll never be satisfied."

Brandon reached over, his hand covering mine. The warmth of his touch anchored me. "What do you want to do?" he asked simply.The question caught me off guard. No one in my family had ever asked what *I* wanted.I took a deep breath. already prepare the exchange agreement?"

Brandon handed me the document. "It's for you, but it's not an exchange agreement."

I frowned. "Then what is it?"

"Remember at dinner when I said I had something for you? Seems we had similar ideas."

Confused, I opened the folder and scanned the first page-a transfer of 20% ownership in Stark Entertainment Group, directly to me.

"Brandon, what is this?"

"We've been married for a while now, and I never gave you a proper wedding gift." He spoke casually. "Consider this your bride price."

"But this is..." I stared at the document. "This is way too much. I don't need all this."

"Nothing is too valuable compared to you." The intensity in his voice made me look up. "Your grandfather was right - money may be external,but that doesn't mean it's not necessary. You married me, and I won't have you at a disadvantage."

"But what about Grandpa's shares-” "James will draft another agreement tomorrow," he cut in smoothly."What your grandfather gave you was his gesture of love, What I'm giving you is mine."

  "Brandon," I said softly, "why are you so good to me?" His answer was immediate: "Because you deserve it." The words hit me hard. All my life, I'd been told I didn't deserve things-

 
not my family's love, not Alexander's loyalty, not even basic respect.

I circled the desk and wrapped my arms around him. He stiffened momentarily before his arms came around me,holding me close.

"Brandon," I murmured, "since you're being so good to me, you have to stay that way forever. No changing your mind." The childish demand made me blush. "My heart isn't very big. It's already been broken once. If you ever betray me, I don't think I could forgive you."

His arms tightened. "I won't. Not in this lifetime."

For a long moment, we just stood there. Then, slowly, he loosened his grip.putting just enough distance between us to lift my chin.

"Are you sure?" The question was loaded with meaning, his dark eyes searching mine.

I knew exactly what he was asking.

"I'm sure," I said, holding his gaze. "We're husband and wife, aren't we?"

"We are." His voice dropped lower. "June, do you understand what you're saying? Once we start this, there's no going back. I won't let you change your mind."

The possessiveness in his tone should have frightened me. Instead, it made something warm unfurl in my chest.

My answer was to rise on my tiptoes and press my lips to his.
###Chapter 82: First Time Making Love

**Summer's POV**

My breath snagged in my chest as Brandon's lips collided with mine.a slow,consuming kiss that set my skin ablaze. His powerful hands cupped my face, fingers digging in with a possessive yet delicate grip that made my pulse stutter. When he eased back, his dark eyes burned into mine.molten with lust, silently daring me to pull away. A flush scorched up my neck, my flesh prickling as if he'd already stripped me bare with that look alone.

"Are you scared?" His voice dropped to a low, velvety growl, coiling around me and sending a tremor straight to my core.

Words failed me. My head tipped in a faint nod, then jerked into a quick shake-caught between the raw hunger clawing at me and the nervous thrum twisting low in my belly. I wanted him, a need so primal it drowned out everything else, but the weight of giving myself to him thundered in my ears, my heart slamming against my ribs.

His thumb skimmed my lower lip, a whisper of a touch that left me quivering. "If it's too much, we stop. Anytime. Just say it."
I shook my head, my voice escaping in a shaky whisper. "No. I want this.I want you." His gaze turned feral, a storm of desire churning behind it. He surged forward, his mouth claiming mine with a savage hunger that sucked the air from my lungs. His hands slid from my face,gripping my waist and yanking me against him until I felt every hard, unyielding inch of his body grinding through my blouse. His heat seeped into me, melting my resolve, my knees buckling as I pressed myself closer. With a predator's grace, he maneuvered me backward until my thighs hit the bed. I collapsed onto the sheets, the cool fabric a stark contrast to the fire raging in me, and he followed, his muscled frame looming over me like a promise. His arms caged me in, elbows braced beside my head, his stare so intense it stripped me raw, my chest heaving as I drowned in it.

"June," he breathed, the nickname spilling from his lips like liquid sin.thick with want. "You're fucking gorgeous."

His mouth descended again, blazing a trail from my lips to the soft dip of mny throat. His fingers attacked my blouse, popping buttons loose with a slow,torturous precision, peeling it open to expose my trembling skin.Each kiss seared into me-down my collarbone, over the swell of my breasts-his lips and tongue ignitinga pulsing heat that had me gasping,my nipples tightening under the thin lace of my bra.

"Brandon," I whimpered, my hands fistingin his dark hair, tugging as my back arched. offering myself to him without shame.

He growled low against my skin, his hands roaming with a greedy reverence. My blouse fell away, my bra yanked free in a swift tug, and the cool air hit my bare breasts a heartbeat before his hot mouth latched onto me. I cried out, fingers clawing at his scalp as he sucked and teased, his tongue flicking over my hardened peaks until I was squirming, a slick ache throbbing between my legs.

He pulled back, his eyes devouring me, dark and insatiable. I moved to cover myself, but he pinned my wrists with a gentle but firm grip."Don't hide from me," he murmured, his voice rough with want. "I want to see all of you." His words unraveled me, nerves dissolving into a pulsing need that set my skin on fire. He tore off his shirt, exposing the sculpted ridges of his chest,the tight V of his abdomen leading down to the bulge straining his pants.When he pressed himself against me, bare chest to bare chest,the heat of him was a drug, his firm pecs grazing my swollen breasts as he kissed me, 
tongue plunging deep, claiming every corner of my mouth.

"Tell me if it hurts," he whispered against my ear, his breath jagged and hot, betraying the leash he kept on his desire.

I nodded, mute with anticipation as his hanad slid down my side, tracing the curve of my hip before diving beneath my skirt. He dragged it off.panties and all, in one slow, deliberate pull, leaving me naked and exposed.My thighs squeezed shut, a fleeting wave of shyness crashing over me.but his-fingers brushed the tender skin there, parting them with a slow,coaxing stroke that made my breath hitch and my core clench.

"You're shaking," he murmured, pausing to meet my eyes, concern flickering through the haze of want. "We can stop-"

"No," I gasped, voice trembling. "Please...don't."

His fingers sank between my thighs, finding the dripping heat that betrayed how badly I ached for him. I bit my lip, a flush scorching my face as he parted my folds, stroking the slickness there with a slow,deliberate rhythm. He teased my clit, circling it until I was panting,hips bucking against his hand as he plunged a finger inside me, then two,stretching me with a delicious burn that had me clutching the sheets and moaning his name. When he shed his pants, I couldn't look away. His cock sprang free, thick and rigid, and he settled between my legs, the weight of him pressing me into the mattress. His eyes locked with mine, searching for hesitation, and I answered by hooking my arms around his neck, dragging him down until his tip nudged my entrance.

 The first thrust was a jolt-a sharp, stretching invasion that made me tense,my walls clenching around him. He froze, jaw tight, muscles rigid with restraint."Breathe, June," he murmured, kissing my brow, my cheeks,my lips. "Open up for me." I exhaled shakily, nodding as he pushed deeper, inch by thick inch.A sting flared as he breached me, my body resisting the sheer size of him.and I whimpered, nails digging into his shoulders. He stilled, stroking my hair, whispering against my skin untiI the pain dulled, replaced by a throbbing fullness as he filled me completely, his cock buried to the hilt.

"Does it hurt?" he asked, voice tight, eyes scanning my face.
###Chapter 83: Protect What's Yours

**Brandon's POV**
I watched June sleeping beside me. Her hair was a mess against the pillow.with traces of last night visible on her skin. As her eyes fluttered open, she noticed me watching and quickly pulled the sheets higher.

"You're awake," I said.

She blushed, avoiding my gaze. "Yeah,,. you got up early! About last night.



"What about last night?" I couldn't resist teasing her.

Her blush deepened when I sat on the bed's edge. She realized how revealing her thin silk nightgown was and yanked the covers to her chin.

"Don't look!" she protested.

I laughed, unable to help myself. This accomplished woman was hiding under sheets like a shy teenager after how she'd come apart in my arms hours ago. I reached out to stroke her hair before pulling her against my chest.

"Is my June feeling shy?" I murmured. "That's not how I remember you last night."

"Stop it!" She covered my mouth with her palm. "Don't say another word!Just pretend last night never happened,okay?" I kissed her palm. "Alright, I'll stop teasing you." I pressed my lips to hers."Hungry? Let's get you fed." Downstairs, I was finishing breakfast when June appeared, dressed in jeans and a simpleblouse. She moved with a slight hesitation that sent a jolt of masculine pride through me. "You good?" I asked, setting a plate before her.

"I'm fine," she insisted, though her cheeks flushed again. "Just a little-"

Her phone interrupted us. After answering, her expression brightened. "He's awake? That's amazing news!"

She hung up, already standing. "Grandpa George is awake. I need to see him."

"Before you go," I said, "there's something we need to handle."

In my study, I handed her the ownership transfer documents for the entertainment company.

"Since this is yours, you should sign it," I said.

June hesitated. "Wasn't I supposedto exchange my shares with you first?"

"You might ruan into your folks at the hospital," I reminded her. "Better get this settled now."

Understanding dawned, followed by a flicker of pain. "God, I'm such a failure at this whole family thing."

"No way," I said firmly. "You're making the smart move. Sign these,and we'll handle the rest together."

James texted that the paperwork was ready. I printed the documents and handed them to June. "Damn, you work fast,"she commented. "When it matters, yeah." I watched her face. "You sure about this? Your family's gonna flip." Her expression h ardened. "I'm sure. As long as you're sure -you're taking on the Taylor family drama."

I laughed. "You think I'm worried about the Taylors? Please. You're my wife now. Your problems are mine."

My words seemed to touch her. She retrieved her grandfather's stock certificates and drafted the transfer letter. I signed without reading it.

"James will get these notarized today," I assured her. "It'll be official by tomorrow."

"They're going to lose it." she said softly.

I cupped her cheek. "Let them. This is about what's best for us-not keeping them happy."

She nodded, placing her hand over mine. "I want to introduce you to both my grandfathers soon. They should meet the man I married."

"Whenever you're ready," I agreed. "I need to hit the office for a few hours.Some meetings can't wait."

June surprised me by rising to press a quick kiss to the corner of my mouth. Before she could pull away, I held her close, studying the newfound warmth in her eyes.

I captured her lips properly, and she responded eagerly. When we broke apart, she pushed gently atmy chest.

"You should get to work," she murmured. "How am I supposed to leave now?" I traced her jawline."I just want to keep you with me all day." She laughed. "Unless you've got a magical pocket like Doraemon, you can't exactly carry me around everywhere." I pretended to consider this seriously. "Maybe I should just tie you to me with a string, make sure you don't wander off."

Her eyes danced with amusement, and I found myself captivated by this lighter side of her.

Later, as I finished dressing, June spotted me by the door and frowned.

"Your tie's all messed up," she said, stepping forward to fix it.

I stood still, fighting the urge to pull her back to bed as her fingers worked.She looked completely focused, tongue caught between her teeth.

"There, perfect," she announced with a satisfied pat.

"Thanks," I said, my voice deeper than intended. "My hands are too clumsy for this. Guess I'll have to rely on my wife from now on."

Her eyes brightened at "wife." "I charge extra for this service, you know."

"How about breakfast every morning as payment?" I kissed her forehead. "See you tonight."

James waited by the car when we came downstairs. I handed him the documents.

"Mr. Taylor is awake," James informed us. "The family's already at the hospital."

June nodded. "I know. I'm going there now." "Alone?" I couldn't hide my concern. "I can't keep running from confrontation," she said firmly. "Some things I need to face myself." I reluctantlyagreed. "Call me if anything happens-anything at all." After she left, my expression hardened as I turned to James."Have Desmond follow her. Don't let her see him."

James looked surprised. "Desmond, sir?"

"You heard me," I explained. "Tell him to report directly to me if anyone gives her trouble."

"What's the status on Victoria Taylor?" I asked, shifting focus.

"She's agreed to the role, but getting out of her current contracts is complicated."

A cold smile spread across my face."Then let's give her another fall before she can rise again - one so hard she won't get up without our help."

As we drove away, my thoughts returned to June. The memory of her shy smile this morning,the way she'd blushed at my teasing.

*Protect what's yours*, my father had taught me. And June was mine now - completely, irrevocably mine. "Like hell you are!" Elizabeth grabbed my wrist. "Nobody's going in until we figure out this shares situation. What did you say to him,huh?" I looked down at her hand, then back up to meet her eyes."Let. Go."
###Chapter 84: Grandpa, I Married Brandon Sta

Summer's POV

The antiseptic smell of Manhattan General hit me the moment I stepped off the elevator. I clutched my bag tighter, bracing myself for the inevitable confrontation with my family.

Elizabeth’s voice reached me before I even saw her, echoing sharply down the hall.

"This is unacceptable! You cannot keep a family from seeing their own father!" She was gesturing emphatically at a nurse who looked entirely exhausted by the display. "Do you have any idea of the legal implications here?"

Richard sat nearby, scrolling through his phone with a tight-lipped expression of indifference. Victoria was huddled in a corner chair, obscured by massive sunglasses and a silk scarf, looking more worried about being recognized by the press than about Grandpa’s health.

"Mom, please, you’re making a scene," Victoria hissed.

"I’m trying to get us inside, Victoria! What else am I supposed to do when they’re blocking the door?"

I took a deep breath and stepped forward. Elizabeth spotted me instantly, her eyes narrowing as she shifted her focus.

"What are you doing here?" She marched toward me, her voice dropping to a low, accusatory hiss. "Haven't you caused enough stress for this family?"

I sidestepped her with quiet composure. "I'm here to see my grandfather, Elizabeth. And I suggest you lower your voice in a cardiac ward."

My calm seemed to catch her off guard. For a moment, she stared at me, her expression flickering with something that looked almost like recognition—or perhaps fear. "Those eyes..." she whispered, stepping back. "You look just like her when she was pushed too far."

I didn't wait for her to regain her footing. A nurse approached me with a look of immense relief.

"Are you Summer Taylor?" she asked.

"Yes, I am."

"Thank goodness. Mr. Taylor has been asking for you specifically since he regained consciousness. Please, follow me."

I followed her into the private wing, feeling Elizabeth’s gaze burning into my back like a brand.

Grandpa looked smaller against the stark white sheets, but his eyes lit up with a familiar spark when he saw me.

"Summer!" He struggled to sit up, but I was at his side in a second.

"Grandpa, stay still," I whispered, my eyes stinging with tears. "I’m so sorry I wasn't here the moment it happened."

He squeezed my hand with surprising strength. "Don't be silly, kiddo. You're here now, and that’s what matters."

"How are you feeling? Truly?"

"Better," he assured me, though the monitors hummed a steady, sobering rhythm beside us. He glanced toward the door. "They're all out there, aren't they? Making a fuss about the inheritance?"

I nodded slowly. "They’re concerned about the shares, Grandpa. Mom mentioned the confrontation."

Grandpa sighed, his expression weary. "It was going to come to a head sooner or later. I gave you those shares in Capital Corp because I know your heart, Summer. You understand that a legacy isn't just about the money—it’s about the people and the integrity behind the name."

My pulse quickened. Guilt gnawed at me, and I knew I couldn't keep the truth from him any longer.

"Grandpa... I need to tell you something. Please, just listen before you react."

"Go ahead. I've survived a heart scare; I can handle a bit of news."

I took a steadying breath. "I transferred the Capital Corp shares."

The room went silent for a heartbeat. "You did what?" He looked more curious than angry. "That’s not like you, Summer. You’ve always been protective of the family assets."

"I got married, Grandpa."

"Married?" His eyebrows shot up. "When? And to whom? I hope this isn't some impulsive reaction to Alexander..."

"No, it’s nothing like that," I said, a genuine smile breaking through my nerves. "It’s someone you’ve actually met. Someone who respects you—and someone who has protected me when no one else would."

Grandpa studied my face, his sharp eyes softening. "You look... different. More settled. Happier."

"It's Brandon Stark."

"Brandon Stark?" Recognition dawned on him. "The young man with the chess set? The one who spent an hour discussing grandmaster strategies with an old man?"

I nodded, feeling my face warm. "That’s him."

"I remember him well," Grandpa mused. "Sharp as a razor and twice as dangerous in a negotiation. So... he wasn't at my party just for the networking. He was there for you."

"He was. And regarding the shares—I didn't just give them away. Brandon insisted on a formal exchange. I now hold a significant stake in Stark Entertainment Group. It was a strategic move to protect both of us."

Grandpa was silent for a long moment, then he let out a soft, dry chuckle. "Well, well. My Summer has certainly found her match. Brandon Stark..." He shook his head in disbelief. "I couldn't have picked a more formidable protector for you myself."

"So you're not upset about the shares leaving the Taylor name?"

"Upset? Summer, I gave them to you to secure your future. If joining forces with the Starks secures that future, then I’ve done my job." He leaned in closer. "He treats you well, doesn't he?"

"Better than I ever thought possible," I admitted softly.

Grandpa nodded, satisfied. "Good. That’s all a grandfather ever wants to hear." He suddenly looked energized. "Now, when do I get to see this husband of yours in a formal capacity? I have a few more chess moves to discuss with him."

"As soon as the doctors clear you," I promised.

"What about your parents? Do they know?"

I shook my head. "No. And I’d like to keep it that way for now. I don't want them using our marriage as a stepping stone."

"Smart girl," Grandpa agreed. "Keep your peace as long as you can. You don't need their drama."

My phone buzzed in my pocket. I smiled when I saw the caller ID. "Excuse me, Grandpa. It's him."

Grandpa waved me off with a grin. "Go ahead, take it."

"Hey, Brandon," I answered, stepping toward the window.

"Say that again." Brandon’s deep, resonant voice sent a pleasant shiver down my spine.

"Say what?" I asked, momentarily confused.

"My name," he replied, a hint of amusement in his tone. "You called me 'Bran' yesterday. I found I quite liked the sound of it."

"Stop it," I whispered, feeling the heat rise in my cheeks as I glanced back at Grandpa. "I'm in the hospital. He’s awake and doing much better."

"That’s good news, Summer. Truly." His voice softened, losing its sharp edge. "How are you holding up?"

"I'm okay now that I've talked to him. And Brandon... I told him. About us."

I looked back at Grandpa, who was watching me with a knowing, grandfatherly smirk. "He wants to meet you properly once he’s discharged."

"I’ll be ready," Brandon replied. "And Summer? I’ll be there to pick you up in an hour. Don't let them get to you."

"I won't," I promised, feeling an incredible weight lift off my shoulders. For the first time, I wasn't just surviving my family; I was building one of my own.

###Chapter 85: Giving Brandon a Surprise

**Summer's POV**

I tucked the blanket around Grandpa's frail form as he drifted off to sleep.Poor thing couldn't even finish telling me about his chess collection before the meds knocked him out. Watching his chest rise and fall, I felt that familiar ache. He was the only Taylor who'd ever truly loved me without conditions.

After adjusting his pillow one last time, I grabbed my purse and braced myself. The vultures were waiting.

The second I stepped into the hallway, Elizabeth pounced, her manicured claws digging into my arm.

"What did your grandfather tell you?" she demanded. "Did he agree to give Victoria the shares?"

I stared at her hand, then slowly raised my eyes. "Let. Go."


Elizabeth's grip only tightened. "Answer me!"

I yanked my arm free. "Seriously? Grandpa's fighting for his life, and all you care about is who gets his damn shares? What kind of daughter are you? I've already told you - I'm not helping with this twisted scheme."

"How dare you?" Elizabeth's face contorted. "You ungrateful little brat! Is this how you speak to your mother?" "Oh,so you remember you're my mother?" I laughed bitterly."That's rich." Victoria stepped between us, her expression a perfect mask of concern."Summer! God, what's gotten into you?" She reached for my hand, but I sidestepped her. Right on cue,her eyes filled with tears-the same trick that had won her countless auditions. What happened to you?" Richard demanded. "Did your grandfather tell you anything?"

"Just that someone deliberately upset him, which triggered his stroke," I replied coolly. "Since you two live with him, maybe try caring about his health instead of his portfolio for once."

Richard's face darkened. "Watch your tone! If you need money, just ask.But company shares? Absolutely not. You know nothing about running a business."

"And there it is," I said softly. "Your real concern."

"I'm the CEO of Capital Corp -of course I care!"

"You're also his son," I countered. "Have you asked about his condition even once sincehe collapsed? And you wonder why Grandpa might give his shares to me?"

Elizabeth cut in, "Enough! Just make her hand over the shares!"

"Forget it. I'm not giving you anything."

Victoria's eyes narrowed. "So they really are yours now?"

Something shifted ina her expression. After a quick glance at Alexander, she completely changed tactics.

"Summer, honey,"she cooed, "I'll buy them from you. Fair and square." "Buy them?" I couldn't help but laugh. "With what money?" Victoria straightened. "I've made plenty in Hollywood! My last three films were-" "If you love entertainment so much, stick with it," I interrupted."Wall Street isn't your scene.""I can learn!" she snapped. "Those shares are wasted on you.Someone might take advantage!"

I borrowed Brandon's cold smile. "I think I'm good. The shares aren't for sale. Not for any price."

I hitched my bag higher. "Grandpa's asleep. I'm leaving."

Elizabeth blocked my path. "You're not going anywhere until this is settled!11


"Summer, be reasonable," Richard used his boardroom voice."Anything else you want, I can give you."

"So now you're threatening me?" I shook my head. "Oh, by the way -Grandpa gave me the shares, but I've already transferred them to someone else."

Richard's jaw dropped. "What? You gave away the shares? When? To whom?"

"I'm not telling you," I replied evenly. "But I'll make you a deal-manage Capital Corp properly and don't transfer your current shares, and I guarantee Grandpa's shares won't threaten your position. However,"I added, "if you change anything about the current structure, I will take action."

"Are you threatening me?" Richard's voice dropped dangerously. "I'm just being clear," I met his gaze. "I'm not the same Summer who always caved. The sooner you understand that, thebetter." I caught Victoria's venomous look and Alexander's calculating stare. "I have to go," I said firmly. Elizabeth stepped forward. "You stop right there,you ungrateful little bitch! I dodged her easily. "Push me too far, and Capital Corp might find itself under new management entirely."

As I reachedthe exit, Alexander caught up. "Summer, wait! Is what you said true? About the shares?"

I slid into my car without acknowledging him. As I pulled away, I made another decision - I was done with Fortune Corp. No more working with Alexander. Time for a fresh start.




The Hamptons estate was quiet when I arrived, Brandon still at work. I headed upstairs with determined steps and gathered all his belongings from the guest room - suits, books, watch case, everything.

One by one, I moved them to the master bedroom, arranging his clothes in the empty side of the walk-in closet. I placed his books on the nightstand closest to the door, remembering how he always positioned himself between me and potential threats.

I changed the sheets to deep navy, added warm amber curtains, and placed fresh flowers on the dresser- nothing too feminine, just enough to add life to the space. Downstairs, I made subtle changes to the living room, then headed to the kitchen. My cooking skills were basic, but I'd been practicing secretly.Tonight would be the real test -a proper welcome home for my husband.I was chopping vegetables when I heard the front door open. Earlier than expected-perfect. I smiled, listening to his footsteps. His footsteps moved upstairs, and I imagined his reaction to finding his things moved. Part of me worried he might be upset- Brandon was partícular about his space. But something told me he'd understand what this gesture meant.

I was arranging plates when I felt him enter the kitchen behind me. Even without turning, I knew he was there - something about the energy shifted when Brandon entered a room.

"Brandon?" I turned, spatula in hand, suddenly feeling oddly shy despite everything we'd shared.
###Chapter 86: I'll Always Be With You

**Summer's POV*

"You're cooking," he observed, his expression softening in a way that made my stomach flutter.

"I thought I'd surprise you," I said, setting down the knife. "But that's not the only surprise."

He raised an eyebrow, waiting.

I wiped my hands on a towel, suddenly unsure how to explain. "I,um...I moved your things. From the guest room. To our room." The words tumbled out in a rush. "I thought since we've already... I mean, I should have asked first,but I wanted to-"

"June." he said softly, cutting off my nervous rambling.

I looked up at him, searching his face for any sign of displeasure. "You're not mad,are you?"

Instead of answering, he stepped closer, brushing my hair back before pulling me against his chest.

"Why would I be mad about that, silly?" he murmured.

I relaxed into his embrace. "You're homeearly today."

His fingers traced lazy patterns on my back. "Missed you." The simple admission sent warmth through my chest. Rising onto my tiptoes, I pressed a quick kiss to his jawlne. "Come on," I said, tugging his hand. "I was in the middle of making dinner." "Let me help." he offered.

In the kitchen. I returned to my chopping while Brandon rolled up his sleeves.

"I can finish this," I insisted. "You've been working all day."

"So have you," he countered, taking the knife from my hand with gentle firmness. "Take a break. I'll handle dinner."

"But I wantedto−′′

A slight smile played at his lips. "Consider it a reward. For your initiative."

He tapped my nose playfully, the casual intimacy of the gesture making my pulse skip.

The rich aroma of sizzling steak soon filled the house. Brandon plated everything with expert care while I poured wine into the crystal glasses that caught the light from the chandelier, casting tiny rainbows across the polished dining table.

"Oh my god," I moaned around a forkful of perfectly seared steak. "Where'd you learn to cook like this?"

Brandon looked amused as he sipped his wine. "College. It was either cook or starve."

 I couldn't stop stealing glances at him across the table, mesmerized by the way the light caught his jawline. After the third time I got caught staring,Brandon set down his cutlery with deliberate precision. I jumped slightly. "Not hungry?" he asked. "No! I mean,yes-it's delicious," I stammered, suddenly focusing on my plate. He shook his head. "Eat properly. Whatever's on your mind can wait."

"Right. Sorry." I nodded, feeling my cheeks heat up.

When we finished, I straightened in my chair, gathering my courage. "I told Grandpa George about us today."

"I know," he replied calmly. "And?"

"My parents found out too," I continued, twisting my napkin. "They think I'm lying about giving the shares away. They seriously think I was after Taylor family money all along!"

Brandon's expression remained neutral. "What's your plan? Need my help?”

"Not yet." I shook my head. "I told them as long as they don't mess with the current ownership structure, my portion won't threaten them. But if they try changing things, I'll use my shares to stop them."

Something flickered across Brandon's face.

"What?" I asked anxiously. "Did I say something wrong?"

"No,you did well," he assured me. "But the shares you have no enough for full leverage. At most, you can establish equal footing want real power, you need absolute advantage. Understand?"

I sighed. "You know I never wanted to get involved in this mess. But I ge what you're saying. The problem is, these are all the shares I have." I paused. "I just found out today that what Grandpa signed over earlier wasn't everything. The complete transfer was in the second document. He gave me all of his shares-forty percent of Capital Corp. No wonder Richard and Elizabeth were freaking out." Even with my limited business knowledge, I understood what forty eant-significant, but not controlling interest.Brandon nodded. "Tll handle this. Don't worry."

His chair scraped against the hardwood as he stood, gathering our empty plates. The crystalware clinked softly as he stacked everything with practiced efficiency.

"Let me help with that," I offered, following him to the kitchen.

He placed his hand over mine, shaking his head. "Go relax. I'Il clean up."

I ignored him, trailing behind as he moved towward the sink. "You know, I always thought Wall Street hotshots like you wouldn't do household chores."

"What did you think I'd do?" he asked, sleeves rolled up to reveal tanned forearms as he ran water over the dishes.

"I don't know. Hit up fancy parties? Network with other finance bros?"

Brandon smiled faintly. "I lefthome young, remember? And not all wealthy people live that lifestyle. Stark family education was... extremely strict."

Something in his eyes flickered-a brief shadow of loneliness. Without thinking, I stepped behind him, wrapping my arms around his waist.

"Thank you, Brandon," I said softly. "For what?" "For giving me a home," I whispered. I closed my eyes, breathing him in, realizing only now did I truly feel like we were family, The thought made me hold him tighter. "Tll always take care of you." I promised. "TI'll always be with you."

"Tll always be with you too," he said, a smile in his voice. "But if you keep hugging me like this, these dishes aren't getting done."

"Oh!" I stepped back, embarrassed. "Right! I'll just... go watch TV!"

I hurried out, his low chuckle following me as I retreated to the living room. The enormous flat-screen glowed dimly against the wall,but I barely registered what was playing as I sank into the plush cushions of the sofa. My mind kept drifting to Brandon-the gentleness beneath his tough exterior, how natural it felt to promise him forever.

The soft padding of his footsteps on the carpet announced his arrival. He settled at the opposite end of the sofa, patting his leg invitingly. Without hesitation, I slid over, laying my head in his lap.

His fingers found my temples, massaging in slow circles that made me sigh.

"That feels amazing," I murmured,eyes drifting closed.

I reached up, finding his jawline. "Lower," I commanded playfully."Bend down more."

Brandon caught my hand. "Stop that."

I pulled free, determined to touch him. My fingers traced his jaw,marveling at the smoothness. "How is your skin so perfect?" I complained. "It's better than mine! Better than most women's. So unfair." His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile. "Why be jealous? I'm all yours." The casual declaration hit me like a physical force, I froze,heart hammering as his dark eyes captured mine. "1, uh... wow. I don't even know what to say," I stammered. "I'm tired. I should go to bed!"

I tried to sit up but my muscles protested, aching from stress and emotion.
I looped my arms around his neck.

"I can't move." I admitted. "Carry me?"

Brandon's eyes darkened. "You sure about that?"

Before I could respond, he stood in one fluid motion, lifting me effortlessly against his chest.

He didn't say a word as he carried me through the dimly lit hallway,his jaw set in a way that made my heart race.

My face burned as I realized what he might be thinking. I buried my face against his shoulder, too embarrassed to meet his eyes, my fingers nervously clutching at his shirt. What have I gotten myself into? I thought,my entire body tingling with a mixture of anticipation and shyness as he pushed open the bathroom door with his foot, the soft click of the latch echoing in the silence.
###Chapter 87:Making Love In A Tub

**Summer's POV**

The bathroom door clicked shut, and Brandon carried me straight to the tub. the air thick with steam from the hot water. He set me down on the edge, my toes dipping into the warmth as he turned off the faucet, the soft drip of water echoing in the quiet. My heart pounded, my skin prickling as he stood between my legs, his hands resting lightly on my hips. I could feel him through his pants, hard and insistent, and a nervous flush crept up my chest.

"Summer," he said quietly, his voice low and soothing as his thumb grazed my cheek. "You okay?"

I nodded.biting my lip, my fingers fidgeting with the hem of his shirt.

He smiled, gentle and reassuring, and leaned in, kissing me slow and deep,his tongue tracing mine until my nerves melted into heat. My hands shook as I fumbled with his shirt buttons, popping them open one by one to reveal his broad chest. I ran my fingers over his skin, hesitant andunsure,and he hummed softly, encouraging me without rushing.

Then came his pants. I bit my lip, my hands trembling as I reached for his belt. The metal clinked loudly in my fumbling grip, and I struggled with the zipper, my knuckles brushing against the thick bulge beneath. My face flamed as I finally tugged his pants and boxers down together, his cock springing free-long, hard, and already slick at the tip. I froze,staring,my breath shallow. "You don't have to be shy," he murmured, his tone warm as he tilted my chin up, meeting my eyes. "It's just me." He stepped out of his clothes,fully bare now, and guided me into the tub, the water sloshing as he settled in first, pulling me down to straddle his lap. 
I yelped softly as the heat enveloped me, my knees pressing into the porcelain on either side of him. He tugged my shirt off, then my shorts,leaving my panties last. His fingers slipped under the waistband,peeling the soaked fabric down my thighs, and I shivered as he tossed them aside,the water lapping at my bare skin. His eyes darkened, roaming over me,and I felt my core clench under his gaze.

"You're so beautiful, you know?" he said quietly, his hands sliding up my thighs as he pulled me closer. The water rippled around us, warm and slick, and I gasped as his fingers found me, teasing my folds before pressing inside, slow and careful. My walls fluttered around him,wetter than the bath itself, and I clutched his shoulders, my nails digging in as he curled his fingers, stretching me gently.

"Brandon..." My voice trembled, needy, and I shifted in his lap, feeling his cock nudge against my thigh. I reached down, wrapping my hand around him,but my grip was awkward, too tight then too loose, my strokes jerky and uneven. I glanced up, embarrassed. "Is this...okay?"

He exhaled shakily, his hand guiding mine with patience. "You're perfect,"he said, his voice soft and steady. "Just go slow-feel me." I tried again,my palm gliding over his length, slick with water and his own arousal,and he groaned quietly, the sound making my pulse race.But he didn't let me fumble long. He lifted my hips, the water sloshingas he positioned me over him. Then he guided me down, his cock pressing into me, thick and unyielding. I whimpered, the stretch burning as he filled me, inch by inch, the water doing little to ease the raw sensation. My hands gripped his neck, my body trembling as I sank fully onto him, his hips flush against mine. "Oh god," I gasped, the fullness overwhelming, my pussy clenching tight around him as the water lapped at my waist. He started to move, slow at first, his hands on my hips lifting me up then pulling me back down,each thrust sending waves through the tub. The wet slap of our bodies mingled with my shaky moans, the heat of him inside me blending with the bath's warmth.

"You feel so good," he murmured, his lips brushing my ear as he rocked into me, deeper now, his cock dragging against every sensitive spot. My breasts bounced with each motion, water dripping from my skin, and I arched into him, desperate for more. He spread my thighs wider,his grip firm but tender, and the angle shifted, hitting something inside me that made me cry out, my voice echoing off the tiles.

"I-I can't-" I stammered, the pleasure coiling tight and fast as he thrust harder, the water splashing over the edge. He reached between us, his fingers finding my clit, rubbing slick, tight circles, and I shattered. My orgasm hit like a flood, my cunt spasming hard around him, gushing into the water as I shook, sobbing his name. He held me through it, his thrusts steady,drawing out every tremble.

"You're amazing." he whispered, his voice breaking as his pace faltered.He buried himself deep, groaning softly as he came, his cock pulsing inside me.spilling hot and thick. I felt it leak out, mixing with the water, and he pulled me against his chest, both of us breathless, the bath rippling around us.

Afterwards, I lay wrapped in sheets, my body still tingling. The memory of him carrying me to the bathroom, how we'd made love in the warm water,made me flush all over again.

"Quit staring at the ceiling," Brandon's deep voice pulled me back. "I'm not," I protested weakly. "Just thinking.""About?" His eyes flicked up from his laptop. "You," I admitted. 
Brandon set his work aside. "You should get somne sleep."

"What about you?" I tuagged at his arm. "Aren't you coming to bed?"

"Hmm." He closed his laptop and slid down beside me. I shifted closer until my arm pressed against his.

I tilted my head toward him, hands reaching for his arm. Brandon leaned over.pressing a soft kiss to my forehead. "Sleep," he murmured.

I closed my eyes, still holding onto him as I drifted off.

I jolted awake hours later to empty space beside me. The clock read 3:27AM.

I switched on the lamp. Brandon's side was empty, like he'd never been there.

I padded across the cold floor to the guest room and knocked softly. No answer.

Turning to head back. I nearly ran into Brandon standing in the hallway with a glass of water.

His eyes dropped to my bare feet. "Where are your slippers? Floor's freezing."

"I woke up and you weren't there," I said, feeling suddenly small."Thought maybe you'd bailed." "Come on." He handed me his slippers and scooped me up. "Where were you anyway?" I asked. "It's like, the middle of the night." "Working. Had to finish some stuff.""What's so important it couldn't wait tillmorning?" My voice had an edgeI couldn't hide.

Brandon studied my face, something shifting in his expression."Nothing that matters."

"Don't go back to work," I blurted, tugging his sleeve. "Stay with me,okay?1

He nodded. "Work can wait." He pulled me closer. "I'm not going anywhere,June. Not ever."
###Chapter 88: Come Work at Stark Group

*Summer's POV

My morning at Fortune Corp started with disaster. I'd barely set my coffee down when Lawrence appeared at my door, his face rigid with anger.

"The Harrington bid was leaked. Board meeting. Now."

In the conference room. I found myself facing a firing squad of executives.They wasted no time getting to the point: the confidential bid documents I was responsible for had somehow ended up in our competitor's hands.costing us a major project.

"I secured those files personally," I insisted, but my protests fell on deaf ears.

The timing couldn't have been worse.Fortune Corp was already struggling since Stark Group had reduced their investment projects - our main source of revenue. They needed a scapegoat, and I was the perfect target.

After an hour of thinly veiled accusations, Richard delivered the final blow:"We're reassigning your projects. Alexander will take over the Johnston account effective immediately."

I left the meeting with my dignity intact but my position effectively gutted.As I mechanically packed up the Johnston files, a strange feeling washed over me.*I should be devastated,* I thought.SOwhy do I feel almost... relieved?* My phone's vibration broke through my daze. Brandon's name flashed on the screen, bringing an instant wave of comfort. "Hey,"Ianswered,my voice softer than intended. "Busy?"His deep voice immediately eased some of the tension  from my shoulders.

"Not really.What's up?"

"What's wrong?" he asked immediately, catching the strain in my tone.

I sighed, leaning back in my chair. "Just... work stuff. The company had a bid leaked to competitors, and guess who they're blaming?"

"What happened exactly?" Brandon's voice sarpened with interest.

I quickly explained the situation - the leaked documents, the accusations,being stripped of my projects.

"They're basically pushing me out without firing me," I concluded."Typical corporate politics."

Brandon's low, derisive snort carried clearly through the phone. "Why keep doing something that makes you miserable?"

The blunt question caught me off guard, then made me smile despite everything. So perfectly Brandon - cutting straight to the heart of the matter.

"Honestly, I've been thinking the same thing," I admitted. "Even before this happened, I was... I was pretty much ready to hand in my resignati 11


"I'll come pick you up." he said. "Pick me up? For what? Don't you have work?" "To take you somewhere. You've got nothing better to do at Fortune Corp now anyway,right?"

  I glanced at my empty inbox, at the Johnston files boxed and ready for Alexander. He was right- I'd been effectively sidelined, with no real work left to do.

"You know what? You're right. Come get me."

After hanging up, I started gathering my personal items-the framed photo of Grandpa George, my favorite pen, the small cactus Ruby had given me last Christmas. Amy rushed in, her eyes wide with alarm.

"Miss Taylor, what are you doing?" she gasped, looking horrified. "You can't leave now! They'll say you're guilty for sure!"

I set down the small box and gave her a reassuring smile. "I'm not quitting,Amy. I just don't have anything to do right now, so I'm heading out early.



"But..." she began, wringng her hands anxiously.

I reached out, gently squeezing her shoulder. "Amy, thank you for believing in me. But... you should focus on your own work. I'll be fine."

She didn't look convinced, but nodded reluctantly. I could feel her confused gaze following me as I headed toward the elevators.



Outside Fortune Corp's towering glass facade, I spotted Brandon's sleek car parked across the street. My phone buzzed with his incoming call,but instead of answering, I waved and jogged over, feeling oddly light despite the morning's drama.
I opened the passenger door, then paused when I saw James behind the wheel."It's pretty obvious they want me to quit voluntarily," I said, wat city blur past the window. "Easier than firing me.""Are you upset about it?" Brandon asked, still playing with my fingers. "Yes, Mrs. Stark, Hello!" James's greeting was perfectly professional, though I caught the slight smile in his eyes through the rearview mirror. Brandon turned to him with a pointed look. "Are we going to sit here all day?"

"No. Mr. Stark!" James immediately straightened,putting the car in drive.

I couldn't help staring at Brandon's profile,admiring the sharp line of his jaw, the quiet confidence in his bearing. Even in casual clothes, he radiated authority.

He caught me watching and his lips curved into that dangerous half-smile.
"How do you think my look?"

I said honestly. "Mmm, very handsome."

Brandon reached back, taking my hand and placing it on his knee. The casual possessiveness of the gesture sent warmth through me.

"Taking you to Stark Entertainment for a bit," he said, his thumb tracing circles on my palm.

"Stark Entertainment? Why-" Understanding dawned. "Victoria's audition is today?"

Brandon nodded. "Since you've got nothing better to do, thought you might enjoy seeing your sister's acting skills in action."

"Good point. Not like I have anything else on my plate right now."

As we drove through Manhattan's crowded streets, I found more about the Fortune Corp situation. tugged my hand. The small gesture brought me back to the present.

"Honestly? Not really," I admitted. "I was planning to resign anyway. This just makes it easier. I'll go in tomorrow and make it official."

I frowned slightly. "Though I guess this doesn't look great on my resume."

Brandon made a dismissive sound. "You're worried about that?"

"Aren't you? I mean, doesn't reputation matter in our world?"

"If you've got skills, there's always someone willing to hire you," he stated with absolute certainty.

I was about to respond when I noticed he was drawing something on my palm. the light touch sending tingles up my arm. His dark eyes held mine as his finger traced patterns across my sensitive skin.

"Come work at Stark Group." he said suddenly.

I blinked, sure I'd misheard."What?"

Brandon's expression turned serious. "Come to Stark Group. I know what you're capable of. Come work with us."

My face heated as I gently pulled my hand away. "I don't know if that's a good idea..."

I instinctively glanced at James, wondering what he thou obviously nepotistic offer. Brandon's brow furrowed. "Why are you looking at him?" James immediately stiffened, focusing intently on the road ahead. "I just don't want special treatment," I mnumbled, feeling my cheeks flush hotter.
###Chapter 89: A Good Show

Summer’s POV

Brandon’s eyebrow shot up at my comment about avoiding special treatment, a controlled half-smile playing at his lips. "Is my wife trying to champion the cause of pure meritocracy to avoid nepotism accusations?"

I shot him a mock-irritated glare, sensing the playful undertone in his voice. "You know exactly what I mean, Brandon. I want to stand on my own feet."

He softened, giving my hand a reassuring squeeze with a quiet sigh. "Rest assured, for now, our private life remains just that—private. No one even knows about our relationship yet."

My chest tightened at the reminder. Keeping our marriage a secret had been my decision—one Brandon had respected—but hearing him acknowledge our 'private status' made me feel a strange tug of conflict. I caught James’s eyes in the rearview mirror for a fleeting second.

"Well, except for James," I pointed out quietly.

Brandon’s gaze snapped to the mirror, his eyes sharpening into a silent reminder of professional boundaries. James instantly stiffened, his posture becoming perfectly rigid. I could sense the assistant's inner struggle at being caught in our marital dynamics once again.

James cleared his throat, choosing his words with practiced diplomacy. "Actually, Mrs. Stark, in my professional capacity, I am exceptionally discreet. You can consider me an extension of the office—practically invisible when necessary!"

I looked at Brandon in surprise before a laugh bubbled out of me. James had a unique way of owning his "situational invisibility" without a hint of embarrassment. "Alright," I grinned, "I’ll take your word for it."

The car glided into Stark Entertainment’s underground garage, pulling into Brandon’s private spot. James hurried out to open the door, his professional mask firmly back in place.

"Sir, Producer Quinn reached out again," James reported urgently as we stepped out. "Miss Victoria Taylor is expressing significant frustration regarding the wait time."

Brandon’s lips thinned into a hard line. "Let her wait. Patience is part of the profession."

I was surprised. "She’s actually losing her composure?" This didn't sound like the Victoria I knew. My sister was usually a master of image control, meticulously maintaining a graceful persona in public while saving her true temperament for behind closed doors.

"It’s standard behavior for talent who feel their time is undervalued," James explained diplomatically. "Especially when they are forced to wait."

Brandon turned to James. "And the script we prepared?"

"As instructed, sir. It’s for the historical espionage drama. She’s being considered for the antagonist—the one whose story ends quite tragically."

"And Director Thomas? I assume he still has reservations?"

James nodded. "He is making his preferences known, sir."

"Find a diplomatic way to address his concerns," Brandon directed before turning to me. "Let’s go upstairs. I want to show you around—you’ll be a vital part of this world soon."

Brandon led me through the sleek, modern corridors of Stark Entertainment, eventually bringing me to a high-tech monitoring suite. Multiple screens displayed various areas of the building, including Studio One.

"The observation room," Brandon explained. "It allows us to monitor production flow without interfering on the floor."

On one of the screens, Victoria was sitting in a waiting lounge, her body language radiating irritation. Even through the silent feed, I could tell she was seething. Her manager sat beside her, nervously checking his watch every few seconds.

"I can't believe this," Victoria’s voice came through the audio feed, sharp with indignation. "I have been waiting for over an hour!"

I winced. This was the raw, unfiltered Victoria—the version only our family knew.

"Let's leave," she announced suddenly, standing up. "This role is mine regardless. I don't need to be treated like an extra."

Her manager jumped up, catching her arm. "Victoria, please! Stark Entertainment is the industry leader. The role might be essentially yours, but we cannot burn bridges. They are likely just delayed—let’s wait a little longer."

A secretary entered the room just as Victoria was about to retort. "Miss Taylor? Mr. Wilson is ready for you in Studio One."

Victoria instantly switched on her "public persona," though the tension around her eyes remained. Her manager discreetly produced an envelope as they prepared to leave. "A small token of our appreciation for your assistance," he said smoothly to the secretary.

"That won't be necessary," the woman replied coolly. "I am simply following the schedule. Mr. Wilson is from headquarters, and his time is very limited."

Victoria’s smile remained fixed, but I could see the fury behind her eyes. "Of course. Lead the way."

I turned to Brandon. "She has no idea that 'Mr. Wilson' is just your proxy, does she?"

Brandon shook his head, a cold, calculating smile playing at his lips. "Not a clue."

On another screen, Victoria entered the vast space of Studio One. James—now acting as the executive 'Mr. Wilson'—sat with the producer and a director’s assistant.

"Miss Taylor," the producer said without looking up. "I trust you’ve reviewed the script Mr. Wilson sent over? Let’s get started."

Victoria glanced at James, who merely gestured for her to proceed. I saw a flash of panic across my sister's face.

"She hasn't read it," I realized aloud.

"Of course not," Brandon noted. "She expects the world to adapt to her name, not her talent."

On screen, Victoria began to stall. "I... well..."

"Miss Taylor," James interrupted, sounding disappointed. "Are you unprepared? Mr. Stark personally asked me to oversee this casting to ensure we find the right fit for such a significant investment."

Victoria’s face drained of color. "Mr. Stark? Brandon Stark is personally involved?"

"Naturally," James confirmed. "While the antagonist is the second female lead, it is a substantial role that requires immense range. Given your recent... public challenges, I assumed you would appreciate this opportunity."

Victoria’s expression shifted through shock and panic before settling into a desperate calculation. "I... I’ve been a bit under the weather," she said, her voice suddenly trembling with a fragile quality. "I apologize."

"If you're unwell, perhaps we should reschedule with another candidate," James suggested smoothly. "Director Thomas already has a few other names in mind—"

"No!" Victoria cut him off. "I just need thirty minutes to prepare. Please!"

I watched as she summoned tears to the edge of her lashes—a perfect display of vulnerability. She truly was an actress, just not in the professional way she thought.

"Thirty minutes," James conceded.

Victoria nodded, turning frantically to her manager. "The script! Where is it?"

The manager’s panicked expression said it all—they hadn't even brought the materials. Victoria turned back to James, her voice strained. "Mr. Wilson... could I possibly borrow your copy? I was in such a rush this morning that I must have left mine in the car..."

"Unbelievable," I muttered, watching the disaster unfold. The show was just beginning.

###Chapter 90: The Boss's Wife?

**Summer's POV**

"Forgot?" James's voice showed barely contained irritation. He then turned to the producer. "Quinn, would you please give Miss Taylor the script?"

Victoria's smile was starting to crack at the edges. Even through the grainy footage. I could see the tension in her shoulders as James continued.

"Miss Taylor, this film is extremely important to Mr. Stark. He's invested considerable capital in this project," James said, his professional tone barely hiding his frustration. "If I don't fulfill my responsibilities here, it'll be my ass on the line when I report back to him."

Victoria shot her manager a venomous glare before quickly composing herself.

"Yeah, this was totally our oversight," she said, voice dripping with practiced contrition. "Won't happen again. Just give me tirty minutes,I'll-"

"Fine," James pinched the bridge of his nose. "Make it quick, Miss Taylor.Mr. Stark has other matters waiting for my attention."

"Of course!" Victoria nodded eagerly.

I watched my sister struggle to focus on the pages, her eyes darting back and forth as she tried to memorize the lines. Her fingers gripped the script so tightly the pages crumpled.

 After James departed, Victoria maintained her strained smile. "Quinn," Victoria ventured, "what happens next...?"The producer settled more comfortably into her chair. "Mr. Wilson might be in a hurry, but I've got all day, Miss Taylor. No need to rush-take it slow. I'll be right here with you."

"I've never seen her like this," I murmured, unable to look away from Victoria's increasingly desperate attempts to memorize her lines.

"So you brought me here just to watch her act?" I asked.

His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile as he beckoned me over.Without warning, Brandon pulled me into his lap, his arms wrapping firmly around my waist.

"What the hell?" I gasped, squirming in surprise. "Let me go!" I shot him an exasperated glare, my cheeks burning.

Brandon chuckled. resting his chin on my shoulder. "Just chill for a sec.Let me hold you."

I sighed in defeat. gradually relaxing against him. His warmth enveloped me, and despite my initial protest, I found myself oddly comfortable.

A knock at the door made me stiffen. "Is that James?"

Brandon's arms loosened. "Come in," he called, as I scrambled to my feet and quickly smoothed down my blouse.

James entered, immediately noticing my flushed face and Brandon's satisfied expression. He cleared his throat awkwardly.

"Sir, about Victoria Taylor.,. she's quite the performer," he reported diplomatically. "Oh yeah?" Brandon asked, amusement evident. "She's..." James hesitated. "Well, let's just say she's persistent." Brandon's smile returned as he gestured toward me. "Wanna take a tour of the place?" "A tour of what?" I asked, eyeing him suspiciously.

"Since she enjoys making things difficult," Brandon said,glancing at James,"might as well play along. How you handle it is upto you." He paused."Let's give her something to really freak out about."

"Brandon!" I bit my lip hesitantly. "Do you really have to do this?"

"Don't you want me to?" He raised an eyebrow, studying my face."If you don't. I won't. But think about it-your kindness doesn't exactly get you muchin return."

I felt my resolve waver. I knew Victoria better than anyone-if Brandon didn't intervene, she'd absolutely focus on making my life hell. Especially now that the Taylors knew about Grandpa's shares.

"Fine," I sighed. "Do whatever you think is best."

"Good." Brandon nodded, dismissing James with a wave.

James had left, Brandon studied my distant expression. "What's going on in that head of yours?" he asked, reaching over to ruffle my hair. "Hmm?"

I shook my head. "I feel like I'm turning into Victoria. But maybe that's not so bad."

"You're nothing like her," Brandon said with unexpected gravity.He cupped my face between his hands. "She's not worth a fraction of who you are."His words sent warmth cascading through me. Even if he was just trying to make me feel better, it worked. "C'mon," Brandon said, offering his hand. "Let me show you around." He led me out, fingers intertwined with mine. We'd entered through the CEO's private access earlier, which was why nobody had noticed us arrive.Now. as we walked through the main corridor, employees stopped and stared at the notorious Brandon Stark holding hands with an unknown woman.

"Cut it out," I muttered, trying to pull away. "Everyone's staring."

Brandon tightened his grip, smiling smugly. He walked slightly ahead,holding my hand behind him in a possessive gesture that practically screamed relationship.

"If you keep this up, the whole damn Street will know about us by tomorrow," I warned.

He turned, suddenly serious. "Does that bother you?"

The directness caught me off guard. Did it? A few weeks ago, I'd have freaked out. But now...

"No," I said finally. "It doesn't."

His face lit up. "Good," he said, ruffling my hair affectionately,causing nearby female employees to gasp. "Don't sweat it, they won't gossip."

"Yeah, right," I scoffed. "People love to talk, especially about someone like you."

"This is my company," Brandon squeezed my hand. "I make the rules. If I can't control something this basic, how do you think I run this place?"

I noticed department heads already directing curious employees back to work. "Guess I was overthinking it."

"Let's meet some people," Brandon said, pulling out his phone. "James,get all department heads in the conference room. Ten minutes." There was a long pause on the other end. "Didn't you hear me?" Brandon's voice turned cool.

"Yes, sir!" James replied quickly. "I'll handle it right away!"

When the executives hurried into the conference room, their surprise was evident. Brandon sat in a side chair rather than at the head of the table,while I was positioned in the main seat. Brandon's hand remained linked with mine, and I could see the curiosity and confusion in everyone's eyes as they connected what they were seeing with the rumors already circulating about Brandon walking through the building hand-in-hand with me.

Their expressions were a mixture of surprise and confusion as they exchanged glances.

Brandon surveyed the room with calm authority, waiting until the last executive had taken their seat before he spoke. I could feel the weight of everyone's gaze, the silent questions hanging in the air.

This was it. No going back now.]
###Chapter 91: New Scandal

**Victoria's POV**

"That's all for today, Miss Taylor." Quinn's voice dripped with fake politeness asshe handed me the script. "Be sure to keep this copy safe.We wouldn't want you losing it again, would we?"

I forced a smile that felt like it might crack my face. The moment the studio door closed behind me, I let my perfect posture slump. Three goddamn hours of being treated like some desperate nobody! Me-Victoria Taylor-Hollywood's rising star and the future Mrs. Alexander Stark.

I stormed through the hallway and pushed through the exit doors, my Christian Louboutins clicking angrily on the pavement.

"How did it go?"Maya asked the second I slid into the backseat.

I threw the script against the opposite door with such force that pages scattered everywhere. "How do you think it went? They made me wait for over an hour! Then that nobody producer treated me like I was auditioning for a student film!"

"Victoria,please calm down. This script is important-"

"Calm down?" I whipped around to face her. "Did you see how that Quinn bitch talked to me?"

"They're testing you," Maya said, carefully arranging the script pages. "It's standard procedure after,.. everything that's happened.""Testing ME? I'm Victoria Taylor! I shouldn't have to jump through hoops for anyone, especially not for some second-rate producer who thinks she's hot shit just because she works for Brandon Stark!" Maya touched my arm. "Take a deep breath. Have some water and try to
relax."

"A small-time producer acting like she's running the show? Please!Brandon Stark himself didn't even have an attitude with me!"

"You're absolutely right!" Maya nodded enthusiastically. "And your performance was incredible. The way you immediately got into character with barely any preparation time? Victoria, your talent just keeps growing."

"My talent has always been exceptional," I corrected her,though I felt myself softening under the praise. "You're just now noticing?"

"No, no, it's always been exceptional, but now it's... transcendent.Who cares about Quinn? Remember who you know. You have Brandon Stark's personal support! Once this film helps you make your comeback, all those people trying to tear you down will be eating their words."

I leaned back against the leather seat, letting Maya's flattery soothe my bruised ego. She was right. This was just a temporary setback. With Brandon Stark backing me, I'd be back on top in no time.




I was halfway through a glass of Pinot Noir when I first saw it.

My name, trending at #1 on Twitter. Not unusual in itself-I was often trending for my roles or red carpet appearances. But these hashtags made my blood freeze.

#VictoriaExposed #FakeInnocence #TaylorGate With trembling fingers, I clicked on the first tag. Photos I thought had been destroyed years ago-me at 18 in a MIonaco hotel suite, straddling the lap of an Italian director. Another with two male models from my first European shoot, their hands places that made me want to vomit just looking at it now.

"No, no, no," I whispered, frantically scrolling through post after post."This can't be happening."

I was everywhere-Twitter, Instagram, entertainment blogs. The carefully cultivated image I'd spent years building was disintegrating before my eyes.

**BREAKING: Victoria Taylor's Good Girl Image SHATTERED**

**Taylor's European Escapades: The Photos She Didn't Want You to See**

My fingers flew across the screen as I desperately tried to understandI the scope of the disaster. My agent, publicist, the studio-why wasn't anyone calling me?

As if on cue, my phone lit up with my agency director's number.

"Patrick," I gasped, "thank God you called-"

"Victoria," he cut me off, his voice glacial. "I need you at the office. Now."


"It's almost midnight," I said, glancing at the clock.

"And yet somehow these photos of you are working overtime. Get here in thirty minutes or don't bother coming in at all." I jumped up, frantically searching for clothes. In the hallway, I nearly collided with my mother."Victoria!" Elizabeth's perfectly plucked eyebrows shot up in surprise." Where on earth are you going at this hour?""Mom, I can't talk now. Emergency at the agency. If any reporters or paparazzi show up at the house, don't open the door and don't answer any questions. Got it?"

"What? What's happened? Victoria-"

"Just promise me!" I begged,already backing toward the stairs.




"Look," Patrick said after hours of closed-door meetings, "I'm going to be straight with you, Victoria. This is bad. Really fucking bad."

"I can explain," I started, but he held up his hand.

"Save it. Those photos are genuinely you, aren't they?"


I swallowed hard."Yes,but-"

"Then there's nothing to explain." He sighed. "We'vebeen trying to contain this all night. It's not working. Whoever released these has serious resources behind them."

The sun was rising by the time I stumbled out of the meeting. Maya was waiting for me in the hallway, her usually perfect makeup smudged from her own sleepless night.

"Well?" She jumped to her feet. "What did they say? What's the plan?"

"There is no plan," I whispered. "They're 'assessing the situation.'Translation: they're going to let me drown." "That can't be right," Maya insisted. "They've invested too much in you!" My phone buzzed in my hand. Alexander's name flashed on the screen.

 "It's Alex," I whispered, showing her the screen before answering."Alex?" "What the actual fuck, Victoria?" His voice was razor-sharp."My phone's been blowing up since dawn with reporters asking for comments. You told me those rumors were all lies! Now there are fucking pictures everywhere!"

"Alex, please, you have to believe me," I pleaded, injecting a sob into my voice. "These aren't real-they're all fake. Someone's trying to destroy me!"

"Don't insult my intelligence," he hissed. "Those photos are clearly you.The same mole on your shoulder that I've seen a hundred times. You lied to my face,Victoria!"

"No, Alex, please!" Genuine panic seized me now. I couldn't lose Alexander-not when I needed the Stark connection more than ever. "This will blow over, I promise. I still have Brandon's support. You could talk to him again, convince him to help me more directly. Brandon will fix this!"

"Brandon?" His voice turned to ice. "You want me to beg Brandon for help again? Do you have any idea how humiliating that was the first time?



The call disconnected.

I turned to Maya, suddenly desperate. "You need to do something.Call in favors, hire a crsis team, anything! That's your job!"

Maya took a step back. "Victoria, I've been trying all night. I've called everyone I know. No one wants to touch this."

"Try harder!" I shrieked. "What kind of agent are you if you can't even handle one PR crisis? If you can't fix this, what good are you to me?""Victoria." Maya's voice turned cold. "I understand you're upset, but this is beyond anything I can control. The director himself has pulled back-what do you expect me to do that he can't?""Wait a second..." My eyes widened. "We need to find someone with enough influence to shut all this down!"
###Chapter 92: Like a Whore

**Victoria's POV**

Maya gave me that look-the one that said she thought I was being delusional. "Victoria, even your agency can't="

"Not them, you idiot!" I felt the first spark of hope I'd had in hours."Someone bigger. Someone with real power." I snapped my fingers rapidly,suddenly energized. "Maya, call Quinn. Tell her I need to-actually, forget it. I'll do it myself!"

I grabbed my phone, scrolling frantically through my contacts until I found Quinn Hall-Stark Entertainment's producer who'd treated me like garbage at my audition. The same Quinn who worked directly for Brandon Stark. The same Brandon Stark who could make this entire nightmare disappear with one phone call.

The phone rang four times before she picked up.

"Quinn Hall speaking." Her voice was cool and professional, with that hint of condescension I'd come to hate.

"Quinn! Hi, it's Victoria Taylor." I forced warmth into my voice, despite wanting to claw her eyes out just yesterday. "I was hoping we could meet?It's rather urgent."

There was a pause. "Miss Taylor," she finally said, her tone deliberaformal. "As you can imagine, I'm quite busy right now. And shouldn't you be dealing with your... publicity situation?" I bit back a sharp retort. The old Victoria would have put this bitch in her place,but desperate times called for desperate measures. "Quinn, please," I softened my voice, injecting just the right amount of vulnerability. "Those photos online-they're not what they seem, They've been manipulated, taken out of context. I just need a chance to explain.Could we meet? Or perhaps you could give me Brandon's contact information? Or even James would work!"

Another pause, longer this time. I could practically hear her internal eye-roll.

"Mr. Stark doesn't take personal calls, and I'm not authorized to share his contact information," she replied, her voice clipped. "As for James, he's unreachable at the moment."

"But this is important!" I insisted. struggling to keep the desperation from my voice. "Quinn, please. My career is on the line here!"

"Miss Taylor. I sympathize with your situation, but there's really nothing I can do." Her tone made it clear she didn't sympathize at all. "If you're still interested in the role, we can proceed with your reading next week.Assuming you're available, of course."

The dismissal was so casual, so cutting, that for a moment I couldn't respond. Was she serious? Treating me like just another actress while my entire life was falling apart?

"Of course I'm still interested," I managed, my throat tight. "I'll be there.Thank you,Quinn."

I hung up before she could say anything else, throwing my phone onto Maya's desk with enough force to make her jump."Fuck!" I screamed, not caring who heard me. "That cold-hearted bitch!" Maya looked up cautiously. "I take it that didn't go well?" "No shit!" I snarled, grabbing my purse. "Call my driver. I need to go to Fortune Corp." "Fortune Corp? But what about your parents-"

"Alex is my fiancé," I cut her off, already halfway to the door. "If anyone's going to help me, it's him. He has to."




Alexander's secretary tried to stop me, of course. Some mousy little thing whose name I'd never bothered to learn.

"Miss Taylor. Mr. Stark is in a meeting right now. If you could just-"

I brushed past her, heading straight for Alexander's office. "He'll see me."

"But Miss Taylor!" She scurried after me, her sensible shoes squeaking against the polished floor. "You can't just-"

I pushed open Alexander's door without knocking, ignoring her protests.Alexander looked up from his desk, his expression shifting from surprise to annoyance when he recognized me.

"Alex," I said breathlessly, "you have to help me this time!"

He frowned, glancing at his flustered secretary. "It's fine,Amy. You can go.



The moment the door closed behind her, I dropped the desperate act and switched to full seduction mode. I locked the door with a soft click,then turned to face Alexander, letting my coat slip from my shoulders to reveal the skimpy dress underneath. His eyes widened slightly-a good sign. "Alex," I whispered, slinking toward him. "You have to believe me. Those photos aren't real. Someone's out to ruin me." I circled his desk, catching his eyes as they dropped to my plunging neckline, my tits practically spilling out. Men were so fucking predictable. "Sabotage?" Alexander scoffed, but the raw lust in his stare betrayed him as I perched on the edge of his desk. "Victoria, don't play me for an idiot.Some of those shots are obviously old-you look barely twenty. Tell me the truth. Were you really-"

"Alex." I cut him off, sliding onto his lap and wrapping my arms around his neck, pressing my body flush against his. "I'm serious about us. You know that. How could I be that kind of slut?" I ground against him,feeling his cock stiffen instantly under me. "Those photos are fake. Okay,maybe one or two are me, but they're from movie scenes! Check them yourself if you don't believe me!"

I buried my face in his neck, letting my tears soak his skin. Guys like Alexander couldn't resist a gorgeous woman in distress-especially one rubbing her pussy against their throbbing hard-on.

"I need you," I purred into his ear, my hand slipping down to grip his swollen dick through his pants, stroking it slow and firm. "Only you can save me now."

Alexander groaned, his fingers knotting in my hair. "Fuck, Vicky... it's the middle of the goddamn workday..."

I'd never let him call me Vicky before-I despised that nickname-but now I just smirked against his skin. "No one will know," I cooed, sliding off his lap and dropping to my knees.I yanked his zipper down, and his thick cock sprang free, veins bulging,the tip already glistening with precum. "Please, Alex. Let me show you how much I need you right now."His grip tightened in my hair,pulling hard. "Yeah, I know, Vicky! Hurry up! Suck it now!"

I flashed a triumphant grin before lowering my head, knowing I had him by the balls-literally. Men were so easy to twist when you knew how to work them. I wrapped my lips around his fat cock, swallowing it deep, my tongue swirling around the head, throat squeezing him tight. I fucking hated every second of it, but I moaned like a porn star, bobbing my head fast and sloppy until he bucked and came hard, grunting as his hot,salty
load flooded my mouth.

After, I climbed back into his lap, straddling his thighs like a cheap whore,my skirt hiked up to my waist, soaked panties grinding against him.

"Alex," I said softly, pressing a gentle kiss to his jaw. "I'm sorry about everything. This was all my fault."

He stroked my hair absently, his expression distant. "I understand. I'll talk to Brandon again, but this is the last time, Victoria."

I kissed him properly, hiding my triumph. "Thank you. I love you,Alex."
I shifted suggestively against him. "Do you want more?"

Alexander's eyes darkened momentarily before he shook his head."Tonight. Not here."
###Chapter 93: Slavery

**Victoria's POV**

I paced outside Stark Tower, checking my phone obsessively. My entire career hung by a thread, and Alexander had been inside talking to Brandon for over an hour. When he finally emerged, I rushed forward.

"Alex! What happened? Did Brandon agree?"

Alex nodded, his expression unreadable. "He did."

Relief flooded through me. I threw myself at him, wrapping my arms around his neck.

"I knew it! Thank you, thank you!" I kissed him passionately, not caring who saw us.

Alex pushed me away. "Victoria, not here."

"Sorry. I'm just so happy! So what's the plan?"

"Don't celebrate yet," Alex warned. "He agreed to help, but there's a condition. You need to sign with Stark Entertainment."

I froze. "Sign with Stark Entertainment? But I'm already under contract with Horizon." "That's his requirement. My uncle made it clear-he helps family, not strangers. He's not going to clean up your image just so another agency can profit."*Family*. That word changed everything. If I signed with his company, I'd be under Brandon Stark's protection. "Fine," I decided immediately. "I'll break my contract with Horizon right now." Alex looked surprised. "Just like that?"

"What's there to think about? Horizon is practically a boutique agency compared to Stark Entertainment! Brandon Stark runs half of Wall Street.If I'm connected to him, my career won't just recover-it'll skyrocket!"

"So you're in?"

"Tell Brandon I accept. One hundred percent."

Breaking my contract with Horizon proved harder than expected. My agent's boss, was infuriatingly smug.

"Victoria, we've invested millions in your career," he reminded me."Your damaged brand doesn't invalidate our agreement."

"With the current publicity. I'm worthless to Horizon."

"Perhaps. But we'd still take a substantial loss by releasing you."


"Name your price," I challenged.

He named a figure so outrageous I nearly choked. "That's fucking insane!"

This dragged on through multiple meetings, with my parents and Alex eventually joining. Horizon wouldn't budge-until suddenly, after a mysterious phone call, the boss changed his tune.

"We've reconsidered. We're prepared to release you for a reasonable termination fee." I knew Brandon must have pulled strings. The "reasonable" fee still hurt,but my parents and Alex covered it. By day's end, I was free.Walking into Stark Entertainment felt different this time. This wasn't just another audition; this was my salvation.

James Wilson greeted me in the conference room, placing a thick document between us.

"This is your contract. Once signed, we can address your publicity concerns."

I reached for a pen immediately. What did details matter when my career was imploding?

"Miss Taylor. you're signing without reading?" James asked, eyebrow raised.

I flashed my most winning smile. "Mr. Wilson, I trust you completely.Given my situation, I'm grateful anyone would take a chance on me."

"While I appreciate your confidence, I must insist you review it first. We'll be colleagues, and I'd hate for misunderstandings to arise later."

Something in his tone made me pause. I started reading, and my stomach dropped. By page three, my hands were shaking with rage.

"What the fuck is this?" I slapped the contract down. "These terms are completely one-sided!"

James remained infuriatingly calm. "I believe I suggested you read it first."

"But you didn't warn me it would be this bad!" I flipped through frantically. "This isn't a contract-it's slavery!" The terms were brutal: For five years, Stark Entertainment would rebuild my career, but I wouldn't see a penny from my first year's earnings.I couldn't date anyone, couldn't attend industry events without permission,and if I violated any term, I'd owe them 50% of my potential five-year earnings. "This contract is invalid. It's completely unfair!"

"Invalid?" James's voice hardened. "A signature makes a contract quite valid,regardless of whether you read it. That's basic business."

"I'm related to the Stark family," I tried desperately. "Mr. Stark wouldn't do this to me!"

"Which Mr. Stark are you referring to?" James asked coolly.

He gathered his papers. "I understand if you need time to reconsider.However, our offer to help with your PR issue was contingent on signing with us. So if you're declining..."

"Wait!" I called as he reached the door. As brutal as these terms were,what choice did I have?

"I'll sign," I said through gritted teeth. "But you need to fix my situation immediately. And I want guarantees about my role in the film-significant screen time and the best scenes."

James smiled thinly. "Follow the rules, and everything will work out fine.Don't you agree?"

I forced myself to nod. "Yes."

True to their word, Stark Entertainment worked quickly. Within hours, the most damaging photos vanished from major sites. Their social media announced me as their newest talent, and the film's account revealed details about my character-a complex villain with a tragic backstory.

Most impressively, they proved the explicit photos were actually from a European art film I'd shot years ago. I could finally breathe again.

Mom appeared in my doorway that evening. "Victoria,is everything okay?Did something happen with Brandon?" "No, Mom, everything's fine," I assured her. "Brandon came through, and P've signed with Stark Entertainment. It's all taken care of."

I didn't mention the brutal contract terms.

"Alex really came through for me,"I added.

"Of course he did," Mom sat beside me. "He's your fiancé. But Victoria,you need to be smarter from now on. Whatever happened in the past needs to stay buried."

I nodded. thinking about how I'd secured Alex's cooperation in his office.

"But Mom, we still have a problem with Grandpa's shares. Summer can't be allowed to keep them."

"I know!" Mom's face hardened. "Your grandfather has lost his mind,but your father and I see clearly. We know who's truly family."

"My concern," she continued, "is that Summer might have already sold those shares."

I laughed. "Mom, don't worry. Summer's not that stupid. She's spent her entire life coveting Grandpa's attention and assets. She's never given up anything-not her toys, not Grandpa and Professor Thompson's affection,not even Alexander!"

I gripped Mom's hands tightly. "Now that she finally has those shares,she'Il want to gloat. We'll find a way to take them back. We absolutely *will*get those shares back. No matter what it takes."
###Chapter 94: What a Married Man Should Noti ce
Brandon's POV

I adjusted my tie as the face of Edward Blackwell, CEO of a top-tier London investment firm, stared back at me from my laptop screen. He looked exhausted—not surprising, considering it was nearly midnight in London. But in our world, when the Stark Group called, time zones became secondary to the deal at hand.

"As I was saying, Brandon," Edward continued, his British accent heavy with fatigue, "the regulatory shifts present challenges, but we can synchronize our strategy if we—"

A soft knock interrupted us. I glanced up as the door cracked open slightly.

"Sorry, let’s wrap this up for today, Edward," I said, closing the laptop. "We’ll continue when you’re more rested."

"Something urgent?" I asked James, leaning back in my chair.

"Mr. Stark, this is regarding Victoria’s contract," James replied, his expression a mask of professional neutrality as he placed a sleek folder on my desk.

I flipped it open to see Victoria Taylor’s signature scrawled at the bottom of our most rigorous talent agreement. "She signed? No attempts at negotiation?"

"She was visibly distressed," James noted, a flicker of something passing through his eyes. "She signed quickly, likely under pressure. Once she realized the extent of the restrictive clauses, she expressed significant frustration in the conference room."

A cold smile touched my lips. "I expected a more calculated response from her. Handle the rest according to the legal parameters."

"Yes, Mr. Stark." James hesitated. "I also met someone today who might be of use. Victoria’s former manager, Maya Coleman. She was left without a portfolio when Victoria terminated her previous contract. Since she is familiar with Victoria’s... professional history, I thought she might continue serving as her manager under our supervision."

I gave a dismissive wave. "Use your discretion on these operational matters."

"Of course." James straightened his suit. "There’s one more thing. Regarding Mrs. Stark’s former apartment... the lease was never officially terminated, and the landlord has been holding it. He contacted me today with a security concern. Apparently, an unidentified individual has been loitering around the property frequently."

My fingers stilled on the desk. "Did he provide specifics?"

"He has taken photographs and wanted to know if he should involve law enforcement next time."

"Tell him to call the police immediately," I said, my voice hardening. "Unidentified individuals near private property are a security risk. We don't take chances with her safety."

"I’ve already instructed him accordingly." James paused, choosing his next words carefully. "Also, Elizabeth Taylor—Summer’s mother—visited the apartment. When she found it empty, she left in a state of agitation, voicing some rather harsh criticisms of her daughter."

My jaw tightened at the mention of the woman’s ongoing hostility. "Noted."

I shifted gears. "What is the status of Alexander and Victoria’s wedding?"

James looked surprised. "I don’t believe Alexander has made any concrete plans yet."

"Then provide him with the necessary incentive. I want that alliance finalized immediately."

James nodded, understanding the unspoken directive. "I’ll handle it, sir."

A soft knock interrupted us again, and Summer’s head peeked around the door, her expression curious.

"Am I interrupting? Are you still working?" she asked, her eyes moving between James and me.

"Not at all," James replied quickly, gathering his papers. "I was just finishing. Mr. Stark, Mrs. Stark, I should be going."

"Wait," Summer called out as he headed for the door. "I’ve prepared dinner. James, you’re welcome to join us."

"You’re very kind, Mrs. Stark," James declined with practiced politeness. "But I really must attend to a pressing matter. Please, enjoy your meal. Good evening."

I caught the flash of confusion on Summer’s face as James made his hasty exit. She turned to me once the door closed.

"Was he in a hurry for a reason? Did you assign him something stressful?" she asked, approaching my desk.

"Business as usual," I answered, watching her as her eyes fell on the open folder.

"Is that Victoria’s contract?" She picked it up, her eyes widening. "I’m not reading this wrong, am I? These terms are incredibly one-sided."

"What’s considered unequal for some is simply the cost of doing business for others," I said, rising from my chair and placing a steadying hand on her back.

"What did you make for dinner?" I asked, guiding her toward the door to change the subject.

"Just some light, healthy dishes," she replied, momentarily distracted. "I’ve noticed you’ve been coughing lately. Since you refuse to take medicine, I’m hoping to help you through your diet."

"Don't change the subject," she added, looking up at me. "What do you mean by Victoria's situation?"

"Think about her standing in the industry right now," I suggested as we made our way downstairs. "She needs the Stark name more than we need her talent."

The dining room was set with several light, healthy dishes. I couldn't help but look at the table with a bit of skepticism.

"Summer, this meal looks... exceptionally disciplined."

"If you took care of yourself, I wouldn't have to resort to this," she retorted, a hint of a challenge in her eyes.

I laughed softly, pulling out her chair for her. "Perhaps I should start considering what a married man needs to pay attention to."

She arched an eyebrow. "Oh? And what might that be?"

"That when your wife starts monitoring your health," I said, leaning down to kiss her forehead, "it’s because she is the only one who truly looks out for you."

She blushed slightly but met my gaze directly. "Someone has to, since you clearly won't do it yourself."

Later, as Summer described her progress in the industry, I realized I’d been absentmindedly tracing patterns on her hand. These small intimacies had become second nature. Perhaps that, I reflected, was what a married man should truly notice—not just the care she took of his health, but how fundamentally his life had improved simply because she was in it.

###Chapter 95: Time for a Fresh Start

**Summer's POV**

The past week had been a blur of hospital visits and quiet evenings at the Hamptons. Ever since Grandpa collapsed, my life had narrowed to Brandon's estate and Manhattan General. I hadn't set foot in Fortune Corp since quitting.

Grandpa had been stuck in that hospital bed for a week, and I'd visited him every chance I got. Since telling him about marrying Brandon,he'd been dead-set on meeting my husband properly.

"How's it looking?" Brandon appeared behind me, his hand settling on my waist.

"Six hours and counting," I replied. "Think that's enough?"

Brandon tasted a spoonful. nodding approvingly. "Perfect. The longer you simmer, the better the flavor. George will love it."

I filled a thermos, screwing the lid tight. "God, I hope this helps. He's been cooped up way too long."

"When he's feeling better, we'll make time for that proper introduction,"Brandon said. "I'm actually looking forward to it."




The antiseptic smell hit me the moment I stepped off the elevator at Manhattan General. Halfway down the corridor, a familiar figure blocked my path-Elizabeth Taylor, arms crossed and eyes cold.

"Well, look who finally showed up," she snapped, her mmanicured fingers suddenly digging into my arm. "You ungrateful little brat, you can't even say hello to your own mother?" I yanked my arm free. "Mom." The word felt hollow.

Her eyes narrowed. "Is that your attitude now? After everything we've done for you?"

"If there's nothing else, I should go in. I brought Grandpa some soup."

"You're not going anywhere," Elizabeth blocked my path. "Tell me the truth about those shares. Did you really give them away?"

I laughed incredulously. "Wasn't I clear enough the other day? You were right there."

"Don't get smart with me," she hissed.

"Look, I already told you-as long as Capital Corp's ownership stays unchanged,may portion won't cause problems. But if anyone tries to mess with the structure..."

"How dare you!" Elizabeth's voice rose. "Capital Corp has nothing to do with you! Who the hell did you give those shares to? How much did they pay you?"

"It doesn't matter," I replied. "The shares were Grandpa's to give, and now they're mine to manage."

Elizabeth's hand shot up, ready to strike. I jerked backward, dodging the slap. The door to Grandpa's room swung open, and George Taylor stood there, leaning on his cane,face flushed with anger. "That's enough!" Grandpa shouted. "What the hell do you think you're doing,Elizabeth? You'd hit your own daughter right in front of me?" Elizabeth paled. "George, you don't understand-Summer betrayed this family! She gave your shares to some outsider!" I yanked my arm free. "Mom." The word felt hollow.

Her eyes narrowed. "Is that your attitude now? After everything we've done for you?"

"If there's nothing else, I should go in. I brought Grandpa some soup."

"You're not going anywhere," Elizabeth blocked my path. "Tell me the truth about those shares. Did you really give them away?"

I laughed incredulously. "Wasn't I clear enough the other day? You were right there."

"Don't get smart with me," she hissed.

"Look. I already told you-as long as Capital Corp's ownership stays unchanged,my portion won't cause problems. But if anyone tries to mess with the structure..."

"How dare you!" Elizabeth's voice rose. "Capital Corp has nothing to do with you! Who the hell did you give those shares to? How much did they pay you?"

"It doesn't matter," I replied. "The shares were Grandpa's to give,and now they're mine to manage."

Elizabeth's hand shot up, ready to strike.

I jerked backward, dodging the slap. The door to Grandpa's room swung open, and George Taylor stood there, leaning on his cane, face flushed with anger.

"That's enough!" Grandpa shouted. "What the hell do you think you're doing, Elizabeth? You'd hit your own daughter right in front of me?"

Elizabeth paled. "George, you don't understand-Summer betrayed this family! She gave your shares to some outsider!" Grandpa snorted. "Summer, come here, sweetheart."

I smoothed my sleeve and moved to his side, taking his arm. "You shouldn't be up. Grandpa. Let me help you back."

"I'm fine," he waved me off. "Been lying around too damn much anyway."

He turned to Elizabeth, his expression hardening. "Those shares were mine to give, and I gave them to Summer. What she does with them is her business." His voice was steel. "And as for outsiders-I think we both know who the real traitors are in this family."

Elizabeth gasped. "We would never let Capital Corp shares leave the family!
11

"Wouldn't you?" Grandpa laughed coldly. "Don't think I don't see what's happening just because I'm old."

"That's not fair! Our shares remain with the Taylors. It's Summer who won't even tell us who she's given control to!"

"Enough!" Grandpa cut her off. "Instead of worrying about Summer.maybe focus on keeping Victoria out of the tabloids. Summer doesn't need your 'concern'anymore."

"Now," he added firmly, "I need to rest. You should leave."

Elizabeth stood with fists clenched before finally storming toward the elevator.

Back in the hospital room, I helped Grandpa settle into his chair and unpacked the thermos.

"You shouldn't stress yourself out, Grandpa," I said, pouring the broth.'s not good for your recovery."
F%
Grandpa chuckled, "You moved pretty quick back there. Not such a pushover anymore,huh?"

I sighed. "She's still my mother. I may have dodged her this time,but she Il find other opportunities."

"Let's drop it," I added, handing him the soup. "Try this instead. Made it specially for you this morning."

Grandpa took a spoonful, his face lighting up. "It's good! Your cooking gets better every time."

"I'm glad you like it. Brandon suggested simmering it longer for more flavor."

"Brandon. Brandon," Grandpa's eyes twinkled. "Sounds like that young man is taking good care of you."

I felt heat creep into my cheeks. "He is."

Grandpa studied me. "You've been here almost every day. Don't you have work?"

I hesitated. "Actually, I'm not at Fortune Corp anymore."

"What?" Grandpa straightened. "What happened?"

I explained briefly-the accusations, being stripped of responsibilities.my resignation.

"Those bastards," Grandpa muttered, "Alexander thinks he can treat my granddaughter like this?"

"It doesn't matter," I assured him. "I was planning to quit anyway. Things were too awkward with Alexander, and Victoria's constant hostility... I just needed out." Grandpa squeezed my hand. "I'm sorry, kiddo. I know how much that job
 meant to you."

I shrugged, fighting the pang of loss. "Some people just aren't worth the effort. Time for a fresh start."

"So what's next?" Grandpa asked. "Any plans?"

"Taking some time off first. Don't worry, I'll figure something out."

"And what does your husband think about all this?"

"Brandon wants me to work at Stark Group," I said with a small smile. "It's a great opportunity,but..."

"But what?"

"I want to earn my position. Not just get it because I'm the boss's wife."

Grandpa chuckled. "Smart man, that Brandon. Stark Group would be lucky to have you." He took another spoonful of soup before asking,"Those Capital Corp shares-do you really not regret giving them up?"

The question caught me off guard. "Are you having second thoughts,Grandpa?"
###Chapter 96: He Is Leagues Ahead of You

**Summer's POV**

Grandpa's eyes crikled at the corners. "This child! Those shares were given to you, so they're yours to dispose of however you wish. I just want to make sure you thought this through. This Brandon Stark..."

"Grandpa, please don't worry," I squeezed his hand. "Brandon is nothíng like Alexander. He's good to me. And trust me, he doesn't need Capital Corp shares."

He nodded slowly. "Capital Corp is nothing compared to Stark Group, I'm old but I know that." His voice softened. "I just want you to be happy,Summer."

"I know what you mean," I smiled. "Actually, Brandon made it clear that while the shares are in his name, they're still mine. And honestly, I got the better deal. Not only did I exchange them for Stark Entertainment shares.but he also gave me some of his own. I'm actually the largest shareholder of Stark Entertainment now."

Grandpa's eyebrows shot up. "You're the majority shareholder of Stark Entertainment?"

I nodded, unable to suppress a smile at his shocked expression.

"Wel1. that eases my mind," he sighed. "Summer, when will you bring him to meet me properly? I need to size up this man who's stolen my granddaughter's heart."

"Soon!" I promised. "As soon as you're discharged."

"Good1, good!" Grandpa nodded, a genuine smile lighting his tired face.

The doctor arrived, insisting Grandpa needed rest. I kissed his forehead'and promised to return tomorrow.

I stepped out of the hospital into the bright midday sun, too distracted to notice the clicking sounds from nearby bushes. I'd been followed since entering the hospital.

"Summer."

I froze at Alexander's voice. He stood directly in my path, immaculate in his designer suit. The shock made me stumble, and my thermos clattered to the pavement.

I quickly crouched to retrieve it before Alexander could help,stepping around him as I rose.

"Summer, what areyou doing?" Alexander's voice carried that familiar exasperation. "Do we really have to be like this?"

"Like what?" I replied coldly. "Mr. Stark, would you please move aside?"

"I heard what happened. Why didn't you come to me?"

"What are you talking about? Come to you for what?"

"You know exactly what I mean. The company situation." His voice lowered. "The leaked files. Was it really you who-"

"Does it matter?" I cut him off. "Why would you care what happens to me?Does it actually matter if I leaked those files or not?"

Alexander's brow furrowed. "Of course it matters. You're-"

"Enough, Alexander. I don't have the energy for this conversation."

"Summer!" He grabbed my arm. "Can't we just talk? Why are you always so hostile? Have you forgotten what we used to have?" What we used to have?" I laughed humorlessly, pulling free."I've forgotten all about it."
I stepped back, voice icy. "Mr. Stark, remember your current posítion. We're nothing more than in-laws now. I'll handle my Fortune Corp issues myself."
Alexander's jaw tightened. "Summer. I've told you about Victoria and me.I don't love her,I-"

"Whether you love her is none of my business," I cut him off. "You chose her, so be good to her. Stop saying these things to me."

The memory of his words at the Plaza Hotel engagement flickered through my mind-his declaration that he'd always loved Victoria.
"You think you're blameless?" Alexander's voice hardened. "You never had your parents' affection or family shares. You have no standing in your own family. You never fought for anything."

He stepped closer. "If you'd had Victoria's position in the family,if you'd had shares in Capital Corp, it would be us getting engaged. I wouldn't have needed to marry Victoria. We were good together."

I stared at him, genuinely stunned. "So this is all my fault? That's the funniest thing I've ever heard."

Anger bubbled up inside me. "You're a grown man with Fortune Corp behind you. Yet here you are with the most pathetic mindset. Do you need a woman's shares to validate yourself? I didn't have shares, Victoria did, so you chose her? Fine. But blaming me? Only men wvithout real ability need to climb on a woman's back. I thought you were different,but clearly..."

I shook my head. "With the same last name, Mr. Brandon Stark is leagues ahead of you." Alexander's face turned red. "What? You're comparing me to Brandon Stark? What does he have? Just family backing and Stark Group. Without those,he'd be just like me."

"No," I said coldly. "You're nothing alike, and you're not worthy of comparison. Brandon has so much more than just his family name and company."

"You seem to know him well. What's your relationship with him?"

"Nothing special. I just think you're absolutely pathetic."

I glanced over his shoulder. "For someone of your stature, causing a scene outside a hospital isn't smart. You may not be famous, but your fiancée certainly is."

Alexander followed my gaze to where a camera flash had gone off. His face paled.

Taking advantage of his distraction, I slipped into my car and sped away,leaving him choking on exhaust fumes as he ran after the photographer.

Safely away. I pulled over and called Brandon. He picked up immediately,his voice unusually gentle. "Hello?"

In the background, I heard muffledI meeting sounds.

"Hi," I replied, hesitating. "I visited Grandpa todlay. I ran into two people."

"People who upset you?" Brandon asked,his tone shifting slightly.

"Yeah. My mom and Alexander, as expected." I admitted, tension releasing at the sound of his voice.

"What did they do?" The dangerous edge in his words was unmistakable.
1%
"It's not a big deal. But when I was leaving, someone was following me and took photos. I've been thinking about who might have it out for me.and besides Victoria and her crew, I can't think of anyone. Could it be her?


There was a brief commotion on Brandon's end, then his voice came through more clearly. "It's okay. I'll handle this. They won't dare do anything to you."

###Chapter 97:Sex

Brandon's POV

"I'm not worried or anything," her voice came through, attempting to sound casual, but I caught the underlying tension. "Just thought you should know someone's been trailing me. No clue what they're after with these photos!"

"Hmm," I responded, keeping my tone neutral while my mind ran through possibilities. The timing was too perfect to be coincidental.

Right on cue, my email pinged. I opened the message to find several photographs—Summer and Alexander outside Manhattan General. The angles were deliberately chosen to suggest an intimacy that didn't exist, a carefully orchestrated setup.

"Are you heading home now?" I asked.

"No." Summer sighed. "I'm just out wandering around. Don't worry about this now. We can talk when you're home."

I allowed myself a small smile at her consideration. "Not necessary. I'm not busy." I signaled James to wait with his documents as I finished the call. These little moments of normalcy with Summer were becoming increasingly precious.

After instructing James to send those photographs to Victoria—a decision made with calculated precision—I headed home.

The Hamptons estate was quiet except for the sound of the shower. On the nightstand, Summer’s phone lit up. Alexander Stark. My eyes narrowed. The persistence of the calls was telling.

The shower stopped, and Summer emerged, wrapped in a towel, her skin still glowing and damp from the heat. She froze when she saw me, her lips parting in a soft gasp.

"What's going on?" she asked, eyes dropping to the phone in my hand.

I extended it toward her. Her face hardened immediately upon seeing the name. She declined the call without hesitation, and when it rang again, she blocked the number entirely. "There. Problem solved."

She turned to face me, searching my expression. "I thought you might be annoyed."

"Why would I be?" I asked simply. Alexander was a non-entity, a ghost of a past she had clearly moved beyond.

I retrieved a fresh towel. "Come here. You'll catch cold with your hair wet."

She perched on the edge of the bed, her body still humming with the lingering adrenaline of her irritation. As I began to dry her hair, the atmosphere in the room shifted. The air grew heavy, charged with a sudden, electric heat. My hands strayed from the towel, grazing the warmth of her shoulders.

Summer leaned back against me, a soft sigh escaping her. "You're so... chill about everything. I wonder what it would actually take to get you worked up."

Instead of answering, I turned her around. The look in her eyes was no longer about the frustration of the phone calls; it was a silent invitation, a deep, mutual hunger that had been building between us for months. I pulled her closer, my mouth finding hers in a kiss that was no longer gentle. It was a claim—passionate, desperate, and absolute.
###Chapter 98: We Need to Rest Now

Brandon's POV

The world outside—the scandals, the photographs, the shadow of the Stark family—faded into nothingness. There was only the heat of her skin and the rhythmic pulse of our shared breath. In the quiet of our bedroom, the intensity between us reached a breaking point.

Every touch was a confession, every whispered breath a promise. I carried her to the bed, the sheer force of our connection overwhelming any need for words. It wasn't just about desire; it was about the profound trust she placed in me, and the possessive need I felt to protect what was ours.

As we moved together, the world narrowed down to the sensation of her hands in my hair and the way she called my name. It was a fire that burned away the last remnants of her past, leaving only the two of us. In that moment of absolute surrender, I knew she was mine, not because of a contract or a name, but because our souls had finally found their rhythm.

We collapsed together in the aftermath, the room smelling of rain and the musky scent of deep intimacy. I held her close, tracing the curve of her back as her breathing slowed, her head resting on my chest. I felt a sense of peace I hadn't known I was capable of.

Suddenly, the silence was sliced by her phone buzzing again. Unknown number.

I kissed the corner of her mouth. "Rest a bit. I'll take care of it."

Summer nodded drowsily, already drifting off. I swiped to answer the call, and immediately, Alexander's frantic voice came through the speaker.

"Summer, you finally picked up? Is this really necessary? Calling the police on me? Summer, you—"

I glanced at Summer. She was fast asleep. I carefully laid her down, but her hand instinctively caught mine. "Where are you going?" she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

"Go to sleep. I'm not going anywhere," I whispered.

"Who are you? Why are you with Summer?" Alexander’s voice turned sharp and angry. "Who the hell is this?"

I narrowed my eyes and ended the call without a word. He called back instantly, but I silenced the phone. Let him shout into the void.

When Summer stirred again a few minutes later, the phone rang once more. This time, she reached for it herself, her drowsiness clearing into sharp irritation.

"Alexander, are you insane?" she snapped. "What is wrong with you?" She caught my eye and stood her ground. "Enough. You're being ridiculous. I never called the police. And by the way, that was my husband who answered. It’s none of your business. Goodnight."

She tossed the phone aside, but it rang yet again. This time, her expression shifted from anger to confusion. "Oh, officer, hello," she said, her tone transforming. "I'm sorry. He's my sister's fiancé. If you need anything, you should contact her."

I sat on the edge of the bed, watching her. "Who was it?"

"The police," Summer replied, reaching up to touch my hair. "That man actually borrowed an officer's phone to call me. Can you believe it?" She turned back to the phone. "My husband and I need to rest now, officer. If that’s all?"

As she hung up, a satisfied smile played on my lips. She had claimed me as her husband twice in one night, with a certainty that left no room for doubt. Alexander was the past; I was her present and her future.
###Chapter 99: Grandpa Jonathan Knows

Summer's POV

The private meeting room at Scarlett's coffee shop smelled of fresh espresso and cinnamon—a comforting sanctuary compared to the complex revenue spreadsheets scattered across the table. I rubbed my temples, focusing on the quarterly reports.

Scarlett pushed through the door, balancing two steaming mugs. "Found you hiding back here," she said, setting one in front of me with a supportive smile.

"Not hiding," I protested, gesturing at the paperwork. "Just fulfilling my duties as a partner. Although, I wouldn't mind skipping straight to the profit-sharing part."

Scarlett rolled her eyes playfully. "How did you survive the high-stakes world of finance? This is just a fraction of what you managed at Fortune Corp."

"That’s exactly why I enjoy this more," I reminded her. "It’s our business, Scarlett. It feels personal."

"Well, since it’s our business, I want your eyes on these expansion plans." She pushed the statements closer. "Even if you trust my judgment, a second perspective is vital."

"Fine. But keep in mind, Brandon’s financial team would probably have this audited in five minutes flat."

"Speaking of people who are busy," Scarlett leaned forward, her tone shifting. "You’ll never guess who I just saw in the main café."

"Who?"

"Your mother and Victoria, along with Alexander’s mother." She looked genuinely surprised by the coincidence. "They seemed to be in deep discussion."

I set down my mug, my mind racing. "Here? What were they planning?"

"A wedding," Scarlett noted. "It seems the arrangements for Victoria and Alexander are moving at an incredible pace. They were discussing venues and guest lists as if time were of the essence."

I leaned back, taking in the news. "I’m not entirely surprised. Brandon mentioned that both families would likely expedite the union to solidify their professional ties."

Scarlett whistled. "Your husband has remarkable foresight. He reads people like a balance sheet."

"He understands motivations," I explained. "Alexander needs the Taylor family connections, and Victoria needs the Stark association. It’s a strategic alliance for them. I’m just glad to be a spectator rather than a participant in that drama."

"I’m glad to hear it," Scarlett said, gathering the documents. "You deserve this peace. Just promise me we’ll get together with Ruby soon."

"Absolutely," I agreed. "And now that I've moved on with Brandon, I’m truly done with the old family cycles."

Scarlett changed topics. "Oh, speaking of the past—did you hear about the Columbia reunion? Kristin mentioned it recently."

I felt a small wave of nostalgia mixed with apprehension. "Is it scheduled for soon?"

"Next month. Everyone is curious about what you’ve been up to since you returned to New York."

I nodded noncommittally. "We’ll see how the schedule looks. With Victoria now working under the Stark Entertainment umbrella, things have become... interesting."

I felt a smile tugging at my lips, thinking of the "special" role Brandon had assigned her.

"What's with that mysterious smile?" Scarlett demanded. "You're clearly holding something back!"

"It's nothing," I insisted. "Just... a sense of poetic justice, I suppose. Anyway, I should head back to the estate."

I returned to the Hamptons estate just as the sun began to set, painting the sky in shades of violet and gold. Finding Brandon’s study empty, I settled into his chair, enjoying the quiet authority of the room while browsing a manuscript he’d left on his desk.

My phone rang, and the caller ID made my heart skip: Grandpa Jonathan.

"Hey, Grandpa," I answered, trying to sound casual.

"So, you still remember your old grandfather?" Jonathan Thompson’s gruff voice came through, sounding uncharacteristically stern. "I feel as though I’m the last to know about the major developments in your life, Summer."

I sat up straighter. "Grandpa? What’s happened?"

"Your mother visited today. She was full of news regarding the Taylor family's new alliances," he said, his disapproval evident. "And then there’s the matter of George Taylor giving you his shares in Capital Corp. Why are you letting yourself be pulled back into that mess?"

"Grandpa, please understand," I pleaded. "Grandpa George means well. He wants to ensure the legacy stays in the right hands. I’m handling it carefully."

"There is something more significant," Jonathan continued, his tone turning serious. "Summer, tell me the truth. Have you married?"

I froze. The secret was out. "How... how did you find out?"

"I have colleagues who keep me informed of such significant changes," Jonathan replied. "Why would you keep this from me? Marriage is a sacred commitment, not a secret to be hidden."

I turned as the door opened. Brandon was leaning against the frame, having just returned from the city. He looked tired but instantly alert when he saw my expression.

"Yes, Grandpa," I admitted, my voice trembling slightly. "I am married. And... you know him quite well."

"I know him?" Jonathan sounded baffled.

"Yes. It happened quickly, but it was the right choice for me."

"Summer, this is highly irregular! To marry without a word to your family—"

Brandon crossed the room, sensing my distress. He gently took the phone from my hand.

"Professor Thompson," Brandon said, his voice calm, resonant, and deeply respectful. "It’s Brandon Stark."

There was a long, stunned silence on the other end of the line. "Brandon? You are the one who married my granddaughter?"

A small, genuine smile touched Brandon’s lips as he looked at me. "I am indeed, sir."

"You... you bold young man!" Jonathan spluttered, though the edge of anger was replaced by sheer shock. "I thought your interaction was purely professional. How did this come to pass?"

Brandon sat on the edge of the desk, his free hand reaching out to gently smooth my hair—a gesture of comfort and solidarity.

"We intended to approach you formally once we were settled," Brandon explained smoothly. "Summer was hesitant at first, and I wanted to ensure I had her full heart before seeking your blessing. You have always been a mentor to me, and your respect means a great deal."

I rolled my eyes playfully at his diplomatic version of the story, and he responded with a quick, affectionate wink.

"As for George Taylor," Brandon continued, "we haven't made a formal announcement there yet. We wanted to speak with you first. Your guidance and your blessing are the ones that truly matter to us, Professor."


###Chapter 100: Bound For Life

**Summer's POV**

"Of course I understand your concern, Professor Thompson," Brandon said.his voice carrying that perfect blend of respect and confidence that he somehow always managed to nail. "Your granddaughter is precíous to me too."

I rolled my eyes at his diplomatic tone. This was the same man who'd pinned me against the kitchen counter just this morning,whispering things that would make even Ruby blush.

"Hmph, don't think your sweet talk will fool me," Grandpa Jonathan grumbled through the speaker, though I could hear his irritation softening."If you don't give me a proper explanation about this whole situation,you know exactly what I'm capable of!"
Brandon's lips curved into a slight smile. "Of course I do, sir. What kind of man would I be if I didn't recognize who I'm dealing with?"
I mouthed "suck-up" at him, and he winked back at me, completely unfazed.

"Now, Professor, since my marriage to Summer is already a reality, when can we formally meet?" Brandon continued smoothly. "Despite you being my mentor, I'm now your granddaughter's husband. We should meet properly.""When you're free, come over," Grandpa replied, his tone warming considerably. "Perfect! I'm available tomorrow, if that works for you?" "Tomorrow it is,then!"When Brandon finally hung up. I collapsed into his desk chair with a groan. "I can't believe you just invited us over to see my grandfather tomorrow."

Brandon leaned against the desk, looking annoyingly calm. "Relax. If I'm not worried,why are you?"

"Because this is Grandpa Jonathan we're talking about!" I threw my hands up. "He might have been your professor, but I've had to deal with him my entire life. You don't know how intense his interrogations can get."

"Trust me, I do," Brandon chuckled. "I was his student, remember? I've faced plenty of his questioning-though admittedly, not about marrying his granddaughter."

"That's exactly my point!" I pressed my fingers to my temples."When Grandpa first introduced us months ago, I completely rejected the idea.Now we have to tell him we're suddenly married? He's going to know something's fishy."

Brandon moved behind me, his hands settling on my shoulders with a gentle, reassuring pressure. "Silly girl. Don't worry about it. If he asks, we'Il just say I pursued you relentlessly until you gave in."
I nearly choked. "And you think he'll believe that? You don't exactly come across as the desperate, lovesick type."

"Don't I?" There was that dangerous half-smile again. "You'd be surprised what I'mn capable of." "Right," I scoffed, fighting a smile. "So that's our story tomorrow-the great Brandon Stark was brought to his knees by love? Let's see if Grandpa buys that." "Matters ofathe heart aren't always easy to explain," he shrugged,effortlessly elegant even in that simple gesture. "Anyway, enough aboutthat. Where did you go today?"

"I stopped by the coffee shop to help Scarlett with the monthly accounts,"
I replied, stretching in the chair. "And guess who else was there?"

"Someone giving you trouble?" His voice immediately took on that protective edge I was starting to get used to.
"No, nothing like that. My mother anid Victoria were there with Alexander's mother."

Brandon raised an eyebrow. "And what were they doing there?"

"Planning a wedding," I said, watching his face carefully. "Victoria and Alexander's wedding, to be specific. You called it, by the way-they're rushing to make it happen."

"Richard Taylor's motivations are hardly a mystery," Brandon replied,utterly unsurprised. "He couldn't pass up this opportunity."

"James mentioned Alexander was causing trouble at my old apartment?"I asked,recalling what Brandon had mentioned earlier.

"Apparently," Brandon nodded. "He showed up, made a scene, and the police got involved. That explains why he was calling from the police station last night."

"God, what's wrong with him?" I shook my head in disbelief. "After I found out about the shares from Grandpa George, his attitude toward me shifted. He said the most bizarre things.""Let me guess," Brandon's voice took on a harder edge."He wanted to reconcile? Claimed his relationship with Victoria was just for her shares?" I stared at him, surprised by his accuracy. "Exactly that. How did you know?"
 "It's predictable," he shrugged.

A comfortable silence settled between us before Brandon suddenly announced, "Let's go out for dinner."

"Oh!" I checked the time and realized with a jolt that it was already past seven. "I didn't make anything! Why didn't you remind me earlier? You've been working all day, and I should have made dinner for you!"

"Silly girl," Brandon said, brushing a strand of hair from my face."Get changed. We'll go out, and maybe pick up a gift for your grandfather while we're at it."

"Right! Give me ten minutes!" I jumped up, suddenly energized by the prospect of going out. Despite living together for weeks now, we'd rarely gone on what could be considered actual "dates."
In the massive walk-incloset, I stood paralyzed by choices. Everything in here was nicer than anything I'd owned before moving in.

"Brandon," I called out, holding up two different outfits. "Which looks better-this one or this one?"

He glanced over from where he was seleeting a fresh shirt. "Both look fine."


"I can only wear one!"

"Then wear that one tonight," he decided, pointing to the deep blue dress in my right hand. "Save the other for tomorrow when we visit your grandfather." I nodded, satisfied with the plan, but another question had been nagging at me. "Brandon, is Diana your own brand?" He looked surprised by the question. "What makes you ask?" "I've been wondering for a while. Since I moved in, everything gets magically taken care of and all the clothes in the closet-except what I brought-are this brand. I've never seen it in stores."
"It's a Stark Group subsidiary," he explained. "Our department stores carry it. but it's not widely known to be connected to us."
As I watched him deftly button his shirt. I couldn't help noticing how different life had become. Just months ago, I was heartbroken and betrayed.living in a tiny apartment and working at a job I barely tolerated. Now I was discussing luxury clothing brands with my husband in our Hamptons estate.

"Here.let me do that," I said, approaching Brandon as he fumbled with his tie.

"I don't know why I have to tie this for you," I complained, though there was no real annoyance in my voice. "Before we got married, you managed just fine on your own."

Brandon's eyes held mine as I looped the silk around his collar."Now that we're married, isn't this the wife's job? There's an old saying-the woman who ties her man's tie binds him to her for life."

I fought back a smile, focusing on the knot. "I've never heard that saying before. Did you just make that up?"

"Maybe," he admitted, his voice softening as I finished the perfect Windsor knot. "But does that make it any less true?"
###Chapter 101: Is That for My Grandpa?

**Summer's POV**

His hands settled on my waist, warm and solid. pulling me closer until I was pressed against his chest. "June," he said, his voice dropping to that soft,serious tone he rarely used outside our home. "Just believe me. That's all you need to do."

My heart skipped, cheeks warming underhis gaze. The sincerity in his voice caught me off guard-this wasn't business Brandon or ruthless CEO Brandon. This was just... my husband, asking for my trust.

"Okay," I nodded, suddenly shy.

His answering smile was small but genuine as he brushed a strand of hair from my face. "Good. Now let's get going. We have a busy day ahead."

I glanced at the clock. "It's already past eight! We still need to find a gift for my grandfather before we visit him tomorrow."

"First things first," Brandon said, reaching for his jacket. "Dinner. Then shopping."

"But what about Grandpa Jonathan's gift?"I fretted,following him toward the door. "The high-end stores in Manhattan will be closing soon after we finish dinner!"

Brandon turned, his expression softening into that rare, genuine smile that made my heart do silly things in my chest. "Food first. Shopping later."

"But-"

"Jonathan would scold me if he knew I let you shop on an empty stomach.
" he said firmly, guiding me down the hallway with a hand at the small of my back. "If we don't find anything tonight, we'll look tomorrow. Come on.



The casual mention of my grandfather, the way Brandon referred to him by his first name with such easy familiarity-it reminded me again how strange and tangled our connections were. My grandfather's favorite student was now my husband. Life had gotten very weird, very fast.




Per Se stood like a jewel in the Time Warner Center, its understated entrance belying the three Michelin stars and reputation as one of New York's most exclusive dining destinations. I'd walked past it dozens of times over the years but never dreamed of entering-the kind of place where if you had to ask about prices, you definitely couldn't afford them.

Brandon's hand rested possessively at the small of my back as we approached the host stand. The restaurant manager materialized instantly,his face lighting up with recognition.

"Mr. Stark!" he exclaimed, bowing slightly. "Welcome back!"

Brandon nodded in acknowledgment. "Is my usual private room ready?"

"Of course, sir. Your private dining room is always reserved for you."The manager's gaze flickered to me momentarily, curiosity flashing in his eyes before his professional mask slipped back into place. "Mr. Lee and Dr.Sullivan are also dining with us tonight, in the adjacent private room."

I felt Brandon's fingers tense slightly against my back.

"Would you like to greet them, sir? They're just next door," the manager added, already moving to lead us through the restaurant.
My hand trembled slightly as I reached for Brandon's arm, suddenly nervous at the prospect of meeting his friends. These were the infamous"Wall Street Four" I'd heard whispers about-Brandon's inner circle. I took a deep breath, mentally preparing myself to be scrutinized and judged by the most powerful young men in New York's financial world.


Brandon glanced down at me, his expression softening imperceptibly. "Not tonight," he told the manager. "Just take us to our room."

The manager nodded smoothly. "Right this way, sir, madam."

The private dining room was exquisite-intimate lighting, panoramic views of Columbus Circle, and a table set with such pristine elegance it looked like a museum display. Brandon pulled out my chair,his movements effortlesslygraceful as he helped me get settled.


"I thought you were going to introduce me to your friends!" I blurted once the manager had left us alone.

Brandon raised an eyebrow. "Did you want to meet them?"

"Well... yes! I mean, they're your closest friends, aren't they?"

"We'll skip it today," Brandon decided, picking up the menu though I suspected he already knew exactly what he wanted. "There will be better opportunities for proper introductions. Besides, I haven't formally met your grandfather or George Taylor yet."

I blinked, surprised by his consideration. Most men would have prioritized their friends over their wife's family. "You're right. It's not really the right time tonight anyway."

"Exactly," Brandon replied, his dark eyes holding mine. "When I introduce you,I want it done properly."
I was midway through the most incredible salmon I'd ever tasted when the restaurant manager reappeared at our door, hovering respectfully.

"Mr. Stark, Mr. Lee and Dr. Sullivan are preparing to leave. They've asked me to deliver this to your table." He presented an exquisite bottle of champagne. "Dom Pérignon, with Mr. Lee's compliments."

Brandon nodded. "They're leaving already?"

"Yes, sir. Mr. Lee mentioned they had other business to attend to."

I glanced at the champagne, impressed by the gesture. "That's very gracious of your friend."


"Edward has his moments," Brandon replied with that enigmatic half-smile.


"He seems like he has good manners," I observed. "Sending a gift when he learned you were here, but not intruding on our dinner. That's pretty considerate."


"Considerate? Yes, I suppose Edward is known for his consideration,"Brandon's tone carried a hint of something I couldn't quite place. "Eat your dinner. I'll introduce you properly another time."

I took another bite, studying Brandon's face. "I've been wondering... you seem to have a special status here. The manager, the private room that's'always reserved..."

"You think I own this place?" Brandon looked amused. "I don't."

"Then who it is then?"

"I'll introduce you one day." Brandon said, his expression turning
mysterious.

Before I could press further, the door opened again to reveal James,accompanied by a distinguished older gentleman.

"Sir. I've brought Mr. Davis from Christie's as requested," James announced.

The Christie's manager bowed slightly, carrying a leather case which he placed reverently on the table. "Mr. Stark. This is Newton's *Principia Mathematica*_first edition. There's some slight yellowing of the pages. I'd planned to have our conservation team restore it before delivery,but Mr.Wilson indicated you needed it immediately."

"This is fine. Thank you," Brandon nodded, examining the book with practiced ease before closing the case.

I stared at the leather case ina disbelief. "Is that... for my grandfather?"
###Chapter 102: He'd Planned This

**Summer's POV**

Brandon didn't answer immediately, his attention seemingly absorbed by the ancient text in front of him. The weigh of my question hung in the air between us.


"So Christie's really is yours?" I pressed,unable to contain my curiosity any longer.


A smile played at the corner of his mouth as he gestured for the others to leave. Only then did he look up, those dark eyes meeting mine.


"Surprised?" he asked, carefully replacing the book in its protective case.

I bit my lip, processing this revelation. "So that precious chess set you gave my grandfather at his birthday party... you arranged that on purpose too?"

Brandon remained silent, turning his attention back tothe antique.

"Why aren't you saying anything?" I asked, studying his profile in the soft lighting.

He finally looked up, his gaze holding a deeper meaning that made me shift in my seat. "I'd planned to find another opportunity,but I never expected you to come to Christie's voluntarily." His voice dropped slightly."I've never cared about methods, only results."

My cheeks heated under his steady gaze. The implication was clear-he'd been making moves I hadn't even recognized. I lowered my eyes, suddenly finding the remaining food on my plate fascinating. Brandon Stark had been playing a game of chess I didn't even know I was part of.
The next morning, I woke with the sunrise, quietly slipping out of bed without disturbing Brandon. Today we were visiting Grandpa Jonathan,and I was determined to prepare his favorite dish myself.

In the kitchen, I carefully measured out ingredients for the special bone broth Grandpa had always loved. It needed to simmer for hours to develop the right flavor, but that was fine-we weren't due at his house until noon.


"What are you doing up so early?" Brandon's voice startled me as he appeared in the doorway, hair still mussed from sleep,wearing only pajama bottoms that hung low on his hips.

"Making broth for Grandpa," I explained, stirring the pot. "He's always loved this recipe."

Brandon approached, peering over my shoulder. "I already got him that first edition Newton. This isn't necessary."

"Maybe not for you," I said, nudging him aside with my hip. "But I want to bring something personal.Something I made."

He raised an eyebrow but didn't argue further, just pressed a quick kiss to my temple before heading for the coffee machine.




Parker opened the door at Thompson House precisely at noon, his eyes widening slightly when he saw Brandon and me standing hand in hand on the doorstep.

"Miss Summer, sir," he greeted, stepping äside to let us in.

"Parker!" I squeezed his arm affectionately. "Where's Grandpa?"
"In the reception room. He's been waiting for you since early morning!"Parker's gaze dropped to our joined hands, a smile tugging at his lips.

Brândon stepped forward, carrying both the antique book and the container of broth I'd insisted on bringing. When Parker reached to help,Brandon politely declined.

"I've got this," he said with an easy authority that somehow didn't come across as arrogant.

I tried to release Brandon's hand as we approached the reception room,suddenly nervous about how Grandpa would react to such an open display of affection. Brandon, however, tightened his grip, refusing to let go. Instead, he paused,using his free hand to straighten my collar with a gentle touch before leading me forward.

Grandpa Jonathan sat in his favorite armchair, academic papers spread across his lap in what I immediately recognized as a staged tableau.He wasn't reading-he was waiting, pretending to be absorbed in work while actually watching the door like a hawk.

"Grandpa, I'm back!" I called, stepping into the room with Brandon's hand still firmly clasping mine.

Grandpa looked up, his expression a carefully constructed mask of irritation. "Oh, so you still remember your old grandfather?" His sharp eyes moved to Brandon. "And you, pretty slick,huh?"

"Professor," Brandon inclined his head respectfully.

"I'm hardly worth that title from you anymore," Grandpa scoffed,though I caught the underlying pride in his tone.

"You'll always be my mentor," Brandon replied smoothly.
"Grandpa, don't be mad," I pleaded, moving to his side and taking his arm.
"It's totally my fault we didn't tell you about getting married!"

Grandpa's eyes narrowed suspiciously. "Yeah right. Don't cover for him.I know this guy too well."

"It really was me!" I insisted, guilt washing over me as I gripped his arm tighter. "Brandon wanted to tell you when we registered. I'm the one who said no."


"Professor," Brandon interjected, his voice calm and steady, "Summer isn't responsible. Blame me."

Grandpa harrumphed, but the corner of his mouth twitched. "Obviously it s you! I've got just this one precious granddaughter, and you quietly marry her without saying a damn word."

Despite his harsh words, I could tell Grandpa wasn't truly angry. This was just his way of expressing that he felt excluded from an important decision.

"Brandon, wanna play chess?" Grandpa suddenly suggested, his tone lightening.

"I'd be honored. Your study?" Brandon responded, catching my eye briefly.

They disappeared behind the study door, leaving me fidgeting in the reception room. Parker brought tea and cookies, but I barely touched them,straining to hear the muffled voices from behind the closed door.

Once, I even pressed my ear against it, jumping back guiltily when I heard footsteps approaching. But an hour passed before they finally emerged.

The transformation was shocking, Grandpa's stern expression had vanished, replaced with unexpected warmth. He even had his arm around
Brandon's shoulders-a gesture I'd rarely seen him extend to anyone.

During lunch, I tried to catch Brandon's eye,silently questioning what had happened, but he merely gave me that enigmatic half-smile that revealed nothing. Even more surprising was Grandpa's behavior-serving Brandon the choice cuts of meat, laughing at his observations like they were old friends.


"Grandpa." I ventured during dessert, "everything okay?"

He patted my hand dismissively. "Well, married granddaughter's like water poured out. You belong to the Starks now."

"I'll always be your granddaughter," I protested.

Grandpa just smiled, his eyes twinkling as he glanċed between us.

"Okay, what did you say to my grandfather?" I demanded on the drive home."He gave you more food than me-his favorite grandchild!"

Brandon chuckled, ruffling my hair. "Just promised I'd take care of you."

"No way!" I folded my arms. "Grandpa doesn't fold that easily. One promise and he forgets being pissed about our secret marriage? Come on."

"You'd prefer if he stayed mad?" Brandon asked, amused.

"That's not what I meant," I sighed, chewing my lip. Our marriage still felt precarious sometimes-built on practical needs rather than emotion.

"Fine," Brandon's voice softened. "Really want to know?"

"Yes!" I turned eagerly.

"I told him you were the one I chased relentlessly until you gave in," he
said with that dangerous smile. "I promised I'd never disappoint you. If I ever did, everything I own would be yours." His hand found mine in the darkness. "But that day will never come."
###Chapter 103: Alumni Reunion

**Summer's POV**

I lounged on the terrace, scrolling through Ruby's increasingly frantic texts about the upcoming Columbia reunion.

My phone rang- Kristina, my old class president.

"Summer! Thank God you picked up," her energetic voice came through."You're coming to the reunion,right? Please say yes!"

"I don't know, Kristina. Is it really worth the drama?"

"Absolutely! Half the department is showing up." Her voice softened. "Please say yes, it's going to be fun!"

"Fine," I sighed. "Tll be there."

Brandon emerged from the bathroom with water still dripping from his hair. I grabbed a towel and gestured for him to sit.

"You'll catch a cold if you don't dry properly," I scolded, gently working the towel through his damp strands.

"Imight be late tomorrow," I mentioned, focusing on a particularly stubborn cowlick. "The alumni reunion."

"Have you going?" Brandon asked, eyes closingas I massaged his scalp.

"Yeah. I wasn't planning to, but Ruby and Scarlett are insisting, and our class president called personally, so..."

"Go if you want to," he said, capturing my wrist to kiss my palm. "You've been cooped up at home toomuch lately. Going out is good for you."
"I won't be able to make dinner."

"It's fine. I have a business dinner tomorrow anyway."

I continued working my fingers in small circles at his temples-a technique I'd learned after noticing how he rubbed this spot when stressed.

"Columbia alumni." Brandon said carefully. "Be careful,hmm?"

I paused. suddenly alert to the undercurrent in his voice. "You think there might be trouble?"

He shrugged casually, but his eyes remained intense. "Just be aware.Victoria moves in those circles too."

"I understand," I said softly. "I'll be careful."




The next morning found me in the garden, pruning roses when Ruby called again.

"We're meeting at seven, right?" she asked without preamble. "The reunion starts at seven, but we should get there closer to eight. Make an entrance, you know? Oh, and guess what - Victoria's going to be there!"

I nearly dropped my shears. "Victoria? Are you sure? She never comes to these things."

"Well, she's coming to this one," Ruby replied gleefully. "That little bitch usually thinks she's too good for alumni events. I bet she's up to something."

"Come on," I sighed. "We're all classmates, after all."
After hanging up, I sank onto a garden bench, memories washing over me.Victoria and I had never been close, but college had been particularly toxic.When she was forced to repeat a year due to poor grades and ended up in my class, everything became a competition. Each time I outperformed her,I'd return home to Elizabeth's lectures about "humiliating my sister."

The only peaceful period had been those two years when Victoria left to pursue acting in Hollywood. Without her shadow, I'd finally been able to breathe.

And now she was coming to the reunion. Victoria never did anything without an agenda.




The Manhattan Club glittered with understated luxury, its private event space transformed by Kristina's expert touch. White roses and blue hydrangeas adorned every table-Columbia colors.

"Look who decided to grace us with her presence," Scarlett teased as Ruby and I arrived at eight. "I almost thought you weren't coming."

"And miss all this?" I gestured around. "Not a chance."

As we mingled, I noticed the subtle shift in conversations whenever I approached. People would smile, greet me warmly, then inevitably mention Victoria.

"Your sister's doing amazingly well in Hollywood," one former study partner gushed. "And now she's signed with Stark Entertainment? That's major!"

"Are you still in finance, Summer?" another asked, barely waiting for my answer. "Victoria mentioned you're taking time off. Must be nice!"
Ruby appeared at my elbow, her expression thunderous. "This is ridiculous!Do you hear how they're talking? Victoria this, Victoria that. She wasn't even at most of our classes!"

"It's fine," I shrugged, though the constant comparisons stung.

"The way some of these guys are drooling -like they've forgotten she was already dating Alexander back then. Remember how many of them asked you out first?"

"Ruby!" I laughed despite myself. "Are you actually enjoying this?"

"I'm just saying, it's pretty twisted how quickly people forget which Taylor sister was actually the catch back in college."

A sudden hush fell over the room. Victoria made her grand entrance,flanked by Anna and Sophie. She wore a stunning red dress that practically screamed 'look at me.'

Kristina hurried forward to greet her. "Victoria! So glad you could make it!It's been ages!"

"Too long, class prez," Victoria smiled. "Couldn't miss this one."

"I was worried you might not come," Kristina admitted. "Just you today? I thought perhaps..."

Anna cut in with a dramatic eye-roll. "Hello? We're right here, Kristina."

"That's not what I meant," Kristina laughed. "I heard you got engaged.Thought you might bring your fiancé along!"

Victoria's eyes scanned the room until they locked with mine in the corner.Something predatory flashed across her features.
"Actually," she announced loudly, reaching into her designer clutch, "I have something for everyone."

Shè produced a stack of elegant golden envelopes, which she began distributing throughout the room.

"I'm delighted to invite you all to my wedding to Alexander Stark next month," she proclaimed. "It's going to be the event of the season, and I couldn't possibly celebrate without my dear Columbia classmates!"

The room erupted in congratulations.

Victoria worked the room until she finally reached our corner. Her smile never faltered, but her eyes hardened when they met mine.

"Summer! You came!" Victoria's voice dripped with false warmth.

"Surprised?" I replied evenly. "I'm just a normal person - of course I'd come. Though I'm surprised to see you here, Hollywood star and all. Didn't think you'd have time for something so... ordinary."

"Don't be silly," Victoria laughed. "We're all classmates! I wouldn't miss our annual reunion for the world."

She extended three golden envelopes toward us. "My wedding invitations.You're all coming,of course."

Ruby and Scarlett accepted theirs with tight smiles. Victoria held mine out last,her perfectly manicured fingers lingering on the envelope.

"You especially, Summer," she emphasized, her eyes glittering with challenge. "My dear sister. I absplutely insist you attend."
###Chapter 104: She Has No Clue

**Summer's POV**

I took the invitation with steady hands, my expression carefully neutral as I opened it. Inside was an exquisitely designed wedding invitation,announcing Victoria Taylor and Alexander Stark's upcoming nuptials. I traced my finger over the embossed lettering, feeling Victoria's eyes locked on my face, searching for any flicker of pain or jealousy.

"Next month, that's really perfect timing," I said smoothly, meeting her gaze. "Of course I'll be there. We're sisters,after all."

Something flashed in Victoria's eyes-disappointment, maybe even confusion. She'd clearly expected me to flinch, to show some sign that I was devastated by her marrying my ex-fiancé. But honestly? That pain felt like it belonged to a different lifetime.

Ruby stood beside me, barely containing herself. I could feel her practically vibrating with indignation, eyes burning holes into Victoria as she opened her mouth to deliver what would undoubtedly be a scathing retort.

I shot her a subtle warning glance. *Not worth it.*

Victoria's perfect smile faltered slightly as she studied my reaction. "You can come?" she pressed, clearly thrown by my composure. "I mean, you're not...busy?"

"Why would I be too busy for my only sister's wedding?" I replied,tucking the invitation into my clutch. "Besides, Alexander and I were good friends before. I'm happyfor you both."

Victoria bit her lip, eyes widening in a practiced display of vulnerability."
Summer, are you still upset with me? About... you know."

I almost laughed at how transparent she was being. This wasn't about sisterly reconciliation-this was her latest performance, with our classmates as the audience.

"Upset? Why would I be?" I tilted my head slightly. "My sister hasn't done anything to hurt me. Actually, I should be congratulating you on your success-thriving career and marriage to a Stark. You've really hit the jackpot."

Victoria's gaze hardened for a split second before her mask snapped back into place. Before she could respond, Anna stepped forward,glass of champagne clutched in her hand.

"Speaking of career success," Anna announced loudly, drawing the attention of nearby classmates, "Victoria just signed with Stark Entertainment! It's official!"

A ripple of impressed murmurs spread through the group.

"Stark Entertainment?" someone gasped. "That's major! Isn't Mia Thomas their biggest star? She's everywhere these days!"

"Didn't they launch her career from nothing?" another classmate chimed in."Victoria, that's incredible."

"Wait, isn't your fiancé's last name also Stark?" asked a guywhose name I couldn't quite place. "Any relation?"

Victoria straightened, chin lifting with unmistakable pride. She shot me a triumphant glance before addressing the group.

"Actually, yes," she purred. "his family is part of the Stark dynasty. You
remember Brandon Stark, don't you, Summer? The one who came to Grandpa's birthday? He's Alexander's uncle!"

I felt my lips curve into an involuntary smile. "Is that right? So the CEO of Stark Group is your soon-to-be uncle-in-law?"

"That's right!" Victoria beamed, clearly delighted that I'd acknowledged her connection to Brandon. "Family is everything,isn't it?"

I couldn't resist. Channeling Brandon's signature raised eyebrow and intense gaze. I said, "I actually thought your fiancé was the Stark Group CEO."

Victoria's smile froze. "No, of course not," she recovered quickly. "Brandon Stark is Alexander's elder. He's your elder too, Summer. Youshouldn't speak so disrespectfully about him!"

"Funny," I mused, "I've never heard Brandon Stark mention having any nephews."

Victoria's eyes flashed dangerously before she forced a laugh. "Summer,you don't even know Brandon Stark that well! How would you know anything about the Stark family connections? They're incredibly complex."

"Is that so?" I replied mildly, deciding not to push further. Victoria had no idea I was married to Brandon, and watching her dig herself deeper was becoming almost entertaining.

"I think I need another drink," I said, extricating myself from the conversation.



"Holy shit," Ruby whispered, pulling me aside once Victoria had moved on
to dazzle another group of alumni. "She has no clue, does she? About you and Brandon?"

I sipped my champagne, watching Victoria hold court across the room."Nope. Not a single clue."

"Can you imagine her face if she knew you're actually Mrs. Stark?" Ruby snickered. "After all that bullshit about family connections?"

I gave her a sidelong glance. "You're enjoying this way too much."

"Hell yes. I am! But seriously, what's the deal with Victoria signing with Stark Entertainment? Isn't that your husband's company? Why would Brandon sign the sister who tried to destroy you?"

I couldn't explain the whole situation here, with potential eavesdroppers everywhere,but Ruby was sharp enough to read between the lines.

"Let's just say Brandon has his reasons," I replied carefully.

Ruby studied my face for a moment before her eyes widened in understanding. "Oh my God," she whispered, "he's setting her up, isn't he?Wait-is that why all those horrible stories and photos about her suddenly disappeared? And now she's got this squeaky-clean image and a fancy Stark Entertainment contract?"

I just smiled, neither confirming nor denying.

"Your husband is fucking brilliant," Ruby declared. "Like,terrifyingly brilliant."

Scarlett rejoined us, sliding into the empty seat beside me with a sigh."What did I miss?"
"Just discussing Victoria's incredible new position at Stark Entertainment,"I said dryly.

"Oh God, don't get me started," Scarlett rolled her eyes. "Do you have any idea what she's been saying while you were over here? She's basically convinced everyone that she has Brandon Stark's personal backing. The whole department thinks she's got an inside track to the most powerful man on Wall Street."

Ruby snorted. "If only they knew."

"I mean, she's not exactly lying," I pointed out, taking another sip of my drink. "She is signed to Stark Entertainment, and Brandon is technically going to be her uncle-in-law once she marries Alexander."

"Are you serious right now?" Scarlett looked at me incredulously."She's deliberately misleading everyone! She's using your husband's name and company to elevate herself, and you're just... fine with it?"
###Chapter 105: Something Happend to Sumer

**Summer's POV**

I shrugged. "What difference does it make? Let her have her moment."

"I can't believe you," Scarlett shook her head. "Victoria has been making your life hell for years, and now she's using your husband's reputation to bolster her own social standing, and you're completely unbothered?"

"Trust me," I said, "it's really not worth getting upset about."

"Fine," Scarlett threw up her hands. "I guess I'm just not as evolved as you are. But I swear, if I have to listen to one more person talk about how they want to get Victoria to introduce them to Brandon Stark..."

I couldn't help laughing at Scarlett's indignation. Over the past few months with Brandon, I'd absorbed some of his unflappable calm. The old Summer would have been devastated by Victoria's tactics, but now they just seemed...childish.

"Let's talk about something else," Ruby suggested, handing out fresh glasses of fruit wine. "Like this place! Manhattan Club is seriously exclusive. Kristina's husband must have some serious pull to rent out an entire floor."

Ruby bumped my shoulder playfully. "Does your husband know who owns this place?"

I shook my head. "I never asked. I doubt it's his, though." *Surely Brandon would have mentioned that, right?* The thought made me pause.Then again, discovering what Brandon actually owned was a constant
surprise.

My head was starting to throb from the noise and the alcohol. I'd had more to drink than I'd realized, and the combination of Victoria's antics and the champagne was making me feel slightly dizzy.

"I'm going to hit the restroom," I announced, standing up. "Be right back."

Ruby caught my hand, looking concerned. "You okay? You look a little flushed."

"I'm fine," I assured her, "just a bit lightheaded. Too much champagne on an empty stomach."

"Want me to come with you?" Ruby offered.

"Ill be fine," I waved her off. "Keep Scarlett company. I'll just be a minute."


Ruby still looked worried. "Be careful, okay?"

"Yes, Mom," I teased, making my way toward the exit.

I was nearly to the door when someone stepped into my path. I blinked,momentarily disoriented, before recognizing Chris Diaz. Seeing him immediately brought back memories I'd rather forget. Back in the college,he once confessed to me but I declined him. Unfortunately Anna had a crush on him so she had hated me ever since. Now those memories just made my headache worse.

"Excuse me," I said, trying to step around him.

"Summer!" He shifted nervously, blocking my exit. "I've been wanting to talk to you all night."
I suppressed a sigh. "Did you need something?"

Chris ran a hand through his hair, looking strangely flustered. "It's...it's been a long time. I just wanted to say hello. We were classmates, after all."

"Hello, then," I replied, offering a polite smile. "Nice seeing you."

I tried to move past him again, but he didn't budge. There was something in his eyes-an intensity that made me uncomfortable.

"Summer!" he called as I sidestepped him. "Could I get your contact information? For, you know, alumni networking. It would be good to stay in touch."

My head was pounding now. "Maybe later? I really need to use the restroom."

Without waiting for his response, I hurried away, feeling his gaze follow me down the corridor.

Finding the restroom required navigating a labyrinth of hallways. By the time I located it, my headache had intensified. I shut myself in a stall,leaning against the door and taking deep breaths.

A wave of nausea rolled through me. I barely made it to my knees in front of the toilet before everything came up. My body heaved violently as I emptied the contents of my stomach-all that expensive champagne and barely touched hors d'oeuvres.

"Ugh," I groaned, wiping my mouth with toilet paper. I hadn't thrown up from drinking since college. The bitter taste of bile lingered as I flushed,embarrassed even though no one else was in the bathroom.

After collecting myself, I stood at the sink,studying my reflection. My
cheeks were flushed, eyes slightly glassy-definite signs I'd had too much to drink. I splashed cold water on my face, careful not to ruin my makeup,then rinsed my mouth thoroughly, and immediately felt more clear-headed.

As I was touching up my lipstick, my phone rang. Seeing Brandon's name on the screen made my heart do a little flip.

"Hey," I answered, unable to keep the smile from my voice.

"It's me," Brandon's smooth voice came through, instantly soothing my frayed nerves."You still at the reunion?"

"Mmhmm," I confirmed. "Are you still out, or did you head home already?"

"Still out," he replied. "I can pick you up soon. Where are you?"

"At Manhattan Club," I told him, then added quickly, "But don't go out of your way. I can get myself home if it's too far."

"Have you been drinking?" Brandon asked, his tone gentle rather than accusatory.

"A bit," I admitted.

"Then you shouldn't drive," he stated simply. "As it happens, I'm at Manhattan Club too. With Edward Lee and the others."

I blinked in surprise. "You're here? At the same place?"

"Mmm," he confirmed. "When do you want to leave?"

The coincidence was startling, but also a relief. I definitely shouldn't drive after all that champagne. "Whenever you're done with your meeting. Just text me, I'm in no rush."
"About half an hour," Brandon replied. In the background, I could hear other voices.

"Is your wife waiting up?" someone teased.

Brandon's voice carried a hint of amusement. "Some of us have spouses to go home to. You single guys wouldn't understand."

"What's that supposed to mean?" someone protested.

Dr.Sean's distinctive voice cut through: "Brandon, don't act all superior just because you're married. It's really disgraceful."

I couldn't help laughing at their banter. On the other end, I could almost see Brandon's smile.

Suddenly, the lights in the bathroom flickered. I glanced up at the ceiling.frowning.

"Something wrong?" Brandon asked, catching my hesitation.


"No, it's just-"

The lights flickered again, then went out completely with a loud pop.Total darkness enveloped me, disorienting and absolute.

"Summer?" Brandon's voice came through the phone, sharper now.

The sudden blackness and the startling noise sent a jolt of panic through me. Before I could stop myself, I let out a terrified scream.

"AHHH!"
###Chapter 106: Chris Diaz

**Summer's POV**

"Summer? Summer!" Brandon's voice came through sharply, but before I could respond, something caught my ankle. I lost my balance and crashed to the floor, my phone flying from my hand and skittering across the tiles.

I tried to stand but a sharp pain shot through my lower back where I'd slammed into the edge of the sink. Grimacing, I pushed myself up anyway,only to feel a stabbing pain in my ankle that sent me tumbling back down.

"Shit!" I hissed, gingerly touching my throbbing ankle. Something had definitely grabbed me - this wasn't just me being clumsy.

I crawled toward where I thought the door might be, desperate to escape the suffocating darkness. When my hands finally found the cool metal of the door handle, I pulled myself up and twisted it frantically.

It didn't budge.

"Hello?" I called out, pounding on the door. "Is anyone out there? Help! I'm locked in!"

Nothing but silence answered me.

"Help!" I screamed louder, my fists hammering against the door. "Someone please help me!"

Panic bubbled up inside me as memories from childhood flooded back -being locked in the dark closet by Victoria when I was six, crying until my throat was raw while she and her friends laughed outside. The same suffocating darkness, the same helplessness.
*No, not again. Not this time.*

I forced myself to take deep breaths, trying to slow my racing heart. This wasn't a coincidence. The lights going out, the door mysteriously locking-someone had planned this.

Victoria was the obvious suspect. And Anna? I remembered how she'd glared at me earlier. Anna had always been obsessed with Chris Diaz in college. but he'd asked me out instead. She'd never forgiven me for that,even though I'd turned him down.

I drew in another deep breath, feeling my mind clear as I analyzed the situation. This was deliberate, not random. Victoria and her friends were behind this-it had their petty cruelty written all over it.

*Don't panic. Brandon will realize something's wrong. Ruby and Scarlett will come looking for you. You're not alone.*

"Is anyone there?" I called again, my voice steadier now. "Hello? Can someone open the door?"

As I pressed my ear against the door, straining to hear any response, a soft.slithering sound came from behind me. At first, I thought I was imagining it - just pipes or the building settling.

Then I heard it again. A distinctive "ssss" - like something sliding across the tiled floor.

My blood turned to ice as I recognized the sound. The soft, unmistakable hiss of a snake.

Every muscle in my body froze. Goosebumps erupted across my skin as terror spread from my core to my fingertips.
"Hello? Is someone in there?" A male voice called from the other side of the door, startling me.

"Yes!" I called back desperately. "Yes, I'm locked in! Please help mne!"

"Summer? Is that you?" The voice became clearer,more familiar.

"Chris?" I recognized his voice with a surge of relief. "Chris, the door's locked from the outside! Can you open it?"

"It won't open," he called back, jiggling the handle. "What happened?"

"I don't know. but-" Something slithered across my foot, and I jerked away instinctively. "Chris, there's a snake in here! Please, get me out!"

"A snake? Are you sure?"

"Yes!" My voice rose with hysteria. "Please, just break the door down!"


"Okay, Summer, move away from the door," Chris instructed. "I'm going to kick it in."

I scrambled to the side, heart pounding as I heard him back up. The snake.disturbed by the commotion, moved faster now - I could hear it sliding across the floor,getting closer.

"Hurry!" I pleaded.

A loud bang shook the door as Chris's foot slammed into it. Once,twice-on the third try, the lock splintered and the door flew open, letting in a sliver of light from the hallway.

In that moment of illumination, I saw it - a dark, sinuous shape on the floor, mere inches from my leg.
Before I could react, a searing pain shot through my calf as the snake struck, its fangs sinking deep into my flesh.

"AHHH!" I screamed, collapsing to the floor as Chris burst into the bathroom.

"Summer!" He crouched beside me, his face contorted with concern. His eyes darted around the darkness before spotting the snake, which had recoiled and was preparing to strike again.

In one swift motion, Chris grabbed the snake behind its head and slammed it against the sink. The snake writhed violently before going limp in his grasp.

"Summer, are you okay?" He knelt beside me, examining my leg in the dim light spilling from the hallway.

"It bit me." I gasped, pointing to the burning pain in my calf where two puncture marks were already visible.

"Shit," Chris muttered, his face grim. "That looks venomous. We need to get the poison out."

Without hesitation, he scooped me up in his arms and carried me out of the bathroom. The hallway lights seemed blindingly bright after the darkness, making me squint as Chris gently set me down against the wall.

"I need to suck out the venom," he said, rolling up my pant leg.

"No,don't-" I protested weakly.

"Summer, this poison is dangerous,"he said firmly."Ineed to get it out before it spreads."
Too weak to argue, I watched as he bent down, his lips sealing over the wound as he sucked and spat repeatedly. My head swam, the world blurring around the edges as the poison and shock took their toll.

"Chris? Summer?" Victoria's voice cut through my haze. "What the hell are you doing?"

I looked up to see Victoria standing at the end of the hallway, surrounded by a group of our classmates. Behind them,Ruby and Scarlett were trying to push through the crowd.

"Summer was locked in the bathroom," Chris explained,wiping his mouth as he stood up. "Someone put a snake in there,and it bit her."

Victoria's perfectly made-up face registered shock, though her eyes remained calculating. "A snake? In Manhattan Club? That's ridiculous."

"This wasn't an accident," Chris said, his voice hardening as his gaze swept over Victoria and Anna. "Someone deliberately locked Summer in that bathroom."

Anna stepped forward, her face flushed. "What are you implying.Chris?That one of us would do something like that? Maybe you should ask why Summer was alone with you in a dark bathroom!"

"Are you serious right now?" Chris's voice rose with indignation. "Summer could have died!"

"Snake? What snake?" Anna sneered. "I don't see any snake. Maybe this was just your sick way of getting Summer alone."

Before Chris could respond, the crowd parted suddenly as a group of men in black suits appeared, led by a tall, imposing figure with a stern expression.
"What's going on here?" the man demanded, his authoritative voice silencing everyone instantly.

The man's cold eyes swept over the group before landing on me,slumped against the wall with my injured leg exposed.

"The nerve of some people, causing trouble at Manhattan Club," he said,his voice dangerously soft. "Don't you know whose establishment this is?"

His gaze fixed on me more intently, recognition flickering in his eyes."Miss,are you alright?"

I tried to respond, but my tongue felt thick and unwieldy. The venom was taking effect, making my vision swim.

He turned to his men. "Take her to the doctor immediately."

Two suited men stepped forward to lift me, but Ruby and Scarlett finally broke through the crowd, positioning themselves between me and Landon's men.

"Hold on," Ruby said fiercely. "Who the hell are you people?"
###Chapter 107: They Dared to Touch BrandonsWoman

**Victoria's POV**

Ruby planted herself in front of Summer like some deranged bodyguard,blocking the suited men. "Back off! You're not taking her anywhere!"

The tall man-Landon, I think someone called him-looked at Ruby with
a flash of recognition before his expression settled back into professional detachment. "Miss, your friend needs immediate medical attention. That snake bite could be fatal if not treated promptly."

"And why should we trust you?" Ruby challenged,eyes narrowing.

"Miss Scott, we need to move quickly," Landon replied, his tone leaving no room for argument. "Mr. Stark sent me."

Ruby's eyes widened at hearing her name. After a moment's hesitation, she nodded. "Fine, but I'm coming with her. We both are." She gestured toward Scarlett.

"That's acceptable," Landon agreed.

"I'll come too," Chris insisted,stepping forward.

One of Landon's men immediately blocked his path. "That won't be necessary," Landon said without even looking at Chris.

As Summer was carried away with Ruby and Scarlett hurrying behind,our classmates crowded around,demanding answers.

"What the hell is going on?" someone yelled.
"You can't just take people!" another shouted.

Landon turned to face the crowd, suddenly seeming taller, more imposing."What's going on is that you people have some serious nerve, pulling this kind of stunt at Manhattan Club. Do you have any idea whose establishment this is?"


The crowd fell silent. Manhattan Club wasn't just any venue-it was legendary among New York's elite, its membership list a closely guarded secret.

Anna pushed forward, her voice high and nervous. "You can't do this!You don't know what happened! This is illegal!"

Landon's lips curved into a cold smile. "Miss, you're standing in Manhattan Club. Here, we make the rules."

Kristina rushed forward. "Sir, I'm so sorry about all this! I'm Kristina Cox-my husband is Louis Cox. We booked this event, and I'm sure we can sort this out!"

"Mrs. Cox," Landona cut her off, "with all due respect to your husband, his name carríes no weight here. Someone brought a venomous snake into these premises and used it to attack anotherguest." His gaze swept over the crowd. "Not only are those responsible not going anywhere, but no one else is leaving either. Not until we get to the bottom of this."

As security herded people toward the elevators, Anna grabbed my arm, her nails digging into my skin. "Victoria," she hissed, "what are we going to do?"

I yanked my arm away."God, get a grip! Nothing's happened yet. Stop acting so guilty."
"But what if they find out-"

"Find out what, exactly?" I snapped. "What did you do,Anna?"

Her eyes darted around nervously. "I just wanted to teach Summer a lesson! After seeing how Chris kept staring at her all night-"

"Are you fucking kidding me?" I snarled, keeping my voice low. "I specifically told you not to do anything stupid!"

"But I only told them to lock her in the bathroom!" she protested weakly.

"Don't give mne that bullshit," I cut her off. "This had nothing to do with me. You saw Chris making eyes at Summer, and you lost it. Just like in college."

"Shut up," Sophie hissed from beside us. "They're watching us."

Across the room, Kristina approached one of the guards, pleading to call her husband. Landon appeared in the doorway. "You may all make calls."he announced, "but anyone you contact who comes here will also be detained until this matter is resolved."

I didn't bother calling anyone. Alexander was useless in a crisis, and my parents would only make things worse. Besides, I hadn't done anything.Anna was the one who should be worried, not me.




Brandon's POV

"We need to get her fever down," Scarlett was saying as I entered the room.She pressed a damp towel to Summer's forehead while Ruby paced anxiously.
"Im going to get more water," Ruby declared,turning toward the door just as I pushed it open.

She froze. "Holy shit... Brandon?"

I ignored her, my focus entirely on June. She lay motionless on the couch,her skin ashen, a sheen of sweat glistening on her forehead. The sight made something dark and vicious unfurl inside me.

I brushed past Ruby and knelt beside the couch, gathering June into my arms. Her skin burned against mine.

"June?" I called softly.

Her eyelids fluttered, gaze unfocused. "Brandon? Is that you? Did you come?"

"I'm here," I assured her, keeping my voice steady despite the rage building inside me. "You're going to be fine."

I turned toward the door. "Sean!"

Sean strode in immediately, medical bag in hand. He examined Summer with swift, professional movements.

"When did this happen?" he asked, checking her pulse.

"Not long ago," Ruby replied. "She was bitten by a snake in the bathroom.Chris sucked out some of the venom,but..."

Sean's expression darkened as he examined the puncture marks."Venomous bite, definitely. Someone extracted most of the venom,which probably saved her life, but there's still toxin in her system. We need to get her to a hospital immediately."
I wrapped my jacket around June's shoulders before lifting her into my arms.


"Tll take her," I said, already moving toward the door. "Have James bring the car around."

As I reached the threshold, I paused, turning back to Ruby and Scarlett. "
This doesn't end here. Someone targeted June, and I want to know who."

Ruby and Scarlett exchanged glances.

"If I had to guess," Ruby said, "it'd be Victoria and her cronies. Anna especially has always had it in for Summer."

"Anna's been weirdly fixated on Summer all night, it should be them."Scarlett added.

"You're saying it's 'should be' them?" I asked, my tone dangerously quiet."I need certainty, not speculation."

"It has to be them," Ruby insisted. "No one else would have any reasona to hurt Summer."

I nodded once. "James," I called.

James appeared immediately, his expression perfectly blank.

"Go find out, and send Miss Scott and Miss Smith to check the surveillance footage," I instructed. "I want to know exactly what happened, and who was responsible. Once you find out whoever is behind this, seize her ASAP!



"And Miss Victoria, sir?" James asked quietly.

I looked down at June's pale face, her breathing shallow against my chest.
"Find out the truth first," I replied coldly. "One step at a time. As for Victoria..." I smiled thinly. "We have all the time in the world for her."

As I carried June toward the exit, Ruby caught up to us. "What's going to happen to whoever did this?" she asked James.

James's voice carried an unmistakable edge. "In all my years working for Mr. Stark, I've never seen anyone who dared harm what belongs to him live to see another sunrise."
###Chapter 108: Who's Behind This?

**Victoria's POV**

The Manhattan Club's second-floor ballroom had turned from elegant soirée to hostage situation in under an hour. What was supposed to be a Columbia alumni reunion-my chance to flaunt mny Stark Entertainment contract and wedding plans-had devolved into this nightmare. Security guards in impeccable suits blocked every exit, their earpieces glinting under the crystal chandeliersas they herded us together like designer-clad cattle.


"Victoria, what are wve supposed to do now?" Anna's voice quivered beside me, her perfectly manicured fingers digging into my arm. Her eyes darted nervously toward the guards. "I mean, they can't just keep us here, right?Don't they know who we are?"

"Seriously?" I hissed, yanking my arm away and glaring at her."I told you not to pull any stupid stunts tonight. I fucking warned you."

Anna's lower lip trembled. "I thought-"

"You didn't think at all," I snapped. "You never do."

Sophie stepped between us, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Cool it, both of you. There are people everywhere. Anyone could be listening."

She was right. The room buzzed with tension as New York's elite whispered among themselves, their entitled indignation growing by the minute. Even Wall Street hotshots who normally strutted around Manhattan like they owned it were reduced to muttering complaints from the corners, too intimidated by Manhattan Club's mysterious ownership to make real trouble.
"This is outrageous," some finance bro in Tom Ford complained loudly to his friends. "Do you have any idea how much I pay in membership fees here?"

"Pipe down. Jackson," his buddy warned. "You know who owns this place?



That shut him up fast. Nobody knew for sure who controlled Manhattan Club, but rumors suggested someone even Wall Street's biggest players feared.

The elevator doors slid open, and James Wilson stepped into the ballroom.My stomach twisted at the sight of Brandon Stark's right-hand man. If James was handling this personally, shit was about to get real.

At the same moment, a harried-looking man in a bespoke suit rushed through the stairwell door, his eyes scanning the crowd frantically.

"Louis!" Kristina's voice cut through the murmurs as she pushed through the crowd. Her usually perfect composure had cracked, revealing the fear underneath her polished exterior. "Louis, I'm over here!"

Louis Cox-Kristina's hedge fund husband-looked relieved for half a second before his expression darkened as he took in the scene. He pulled Kristina into a quick embrace.

"What the hell is going on?" he demanded, his eyes darting around the room. "You said this was just an alumni thing. Why are there guards everywhere?"

Kristina gripped his sleeve. "I don't know what happened! One minute everything was fine, the next my classmate got locked in a bathroom and bitten by a snake. Manhattan Club security swarmed in and won't let
anyone leave until they figure out who did it. They've been holding us here!"

Louis went pale. "A snake? In Manhattan Club? Jesus Christ, Kris." He lowered his voice. "This isn't just about someone getting huart. You don't lock down a venue like this over an accident."

"What do you mean?" Kristina asked.

"Never mind." Louis was already moving, his eyes fixed on James Wilson across the room. "I need to talk to him."

I watched Louis approach James with careful deference, the way people always did around Brandon's people. Even millionaires like Louis knew better than to cross Stark Group.

"Mr. Wilson!" Louis called out, extending his hand.

James turned,offering a professional smile. "Mr. Cox. It's been a while. I trust everything's well?"

They exchanged pleasantries, but I couldn't hear the rest of their conversation. James's expression remainedperfectly controlled, while Louis's face cycled through shock, understanding, and finally fear.

Next to me, Anna was practically hyperventilating.

"Calm down," I hissed. "You're making us look suspicious."

"But what if they find out-" Anna's voice rose with panic.

Before she could finish, the room fell silent as two more security guards entered. Unlike the others státioned around the perimeter, these two moved with purpose, cutting straight through the crowd-directly toward

My heart stopped as they reached our little group, but relief flooded me when they grabbed Anna instead of me.

"Miss Watson?" one of them said. It wasn't a question. "You'll need to come with us."

Anna's eyes went wide with terror. "What? No! I didn't do anything!" She struggled against their grip, her designer heels scraping across the marble floor."You can't just-this is illegal! Do you know who I am?"

The guards remained impassive as they began dragging her toward the service elevator. Anna twisted in their grasp, her perfectly styled hair coming undone as she thrashed.

"Victoria!" she screamed, her hand reaching out to me. "Help me! Tell them who you are! Tell them Brandon Stark is your fiancé's uncle! Make them stop!"

My throat tightened as every eye in the room turned to me. Anna continued to struggle, growing more desperate.

"My brother is Joe Watson! He's the CEO of the Watson Group! You can't take me!"

I turned away, my fingernails digging painfully into my palms as I pretended not to hear her. The room felt suffocatingly hot, Anna's pleading voice growing fainter as the guards pulled her into the service area.

"Victoria..."

The elevator doors closed, cutting off her final cry. The silence that
followed was deafening.

A moment later, the head of security stepped forward,addressing the room."The situation has been resolved. You're all free to go."

The collective sigh of relief was audible as people rushed toward the exits,eager to escape before something else happened. Louis had returned to Kristina's side, his face ashen as he hurried her toward the door.

"What did James say?" Kristina asked.

"Not now," Louis muttered, his grip tight on her arm. "They've cleared you of any involvement. That's all that matters."

"But what about-"

"Listen to me," Louis cut her off, his voice dropping to a harsh whisper."Stay away from these people. " As they passed us, Louis shot me a look cold enough to freeze hell. I knew he was referring us. Whatever James had told him, Louis knew exactly who was responsible.

Once the room had nearly emptied, Sophie grabbed my elbow. "Let's go,"she murmured.
"Anna," I started, my voice catching. "They took her. What are they going to-

"Shh!" Sophie's fingers dug into my arm as she glanced around nervously."Not here. This place probably has cameras everywhere, maybe even microphones. We need to leave."
###Chapter 109: Brandon's Revenge

**Brandon's POV**

The hospital corridors blurred as I carried June's limp body through Sean's private medical facility. Her skin burned against my chest,her breathing shallow and uneven.

"Sir, this way," a nurse called, rushing ahead.

The medical team was waiting- I'd made sure of that. No one kept Brandon Stark waiting, especially not when it concerned my wife.

I laid June on the examination table, something dark and primal clawing at my chest. Whoever did this would pay dearly.

"She was bitten by a snake," I told the doctor, my voice ice-cold."Check if the poison's been completely cleared."

I refused to leave despite the nurse's suggestions, watching every movement as they worked on June. The staff moved with exceptional precision, the tension palpable - they knew failure wasn't an option. Not with me standing there.

"We've administered anitivenom," the doctor finally said. "She'll need to stay overnight for observation."

I nodded curtly. "I'll be staying as well."

Throughout the night, I maintained my vigil. The nursing staff tiptoed around during their checks, clearly intimidated by my presence.Good.

When dawn broke, June's eyelids fluttered open.
"Brandon?" Her voice was barely a whisper.

I pressed a thermometer against her forehead. "Still a bit feverish." I helped her drink some water. "How are you feeling?"

"What am I doing in a hospital?" Realization dawned in her eyes."Manhattan Club... the bathroom...there was a snake..."

Cold fury washed through me. This wasn't random.

"Yesterday..." she began hesitantly.

"Don't worry about it," I cut in firmly. "I'm handling everything."

"June." I took the glass from her hand, setting it aside. "I'm sorry. It's my fault to let you get hurt."

She looked at me, those expressive eyes searching my face. "It wasn't your fault, you know. No one could have predicted this would happen."

"I should have been more careful. I should have anticipated this."

"That's ridiculous," she protested, shifting to sit up straighter. "How could anyone have known someone would put a snake in a bathroom? That's practically a movie villain plot."

My jaw tightened. Of course it was. She was my wife. Her safety was my responsibility.

"Do you know who did it?" she asked.

"James is investigating," I replied. "You don't need to worry."

"I think Victoria might be involved," she said. "Why would she still be targeting me? She got what she wanted- Alexander, the Stark name, her
entertainment contract..."

"Speaking of that," I said, "it might be time to give her something productive to do. She seems to have too much free time if she's constantly fixated on you."


The doctor confirmed the venom had been neutralized, and only then did I feel the tight knot in my chest begin to loosen.

"Chris did that," June said. "He sucked the venom out."

I kept my expression neutral, filing the name away for investigation.

By afternoon, June had improved significantly. I'd reluctantly agreed to let Ruby and Scarlett visit.

"I should head back to the office," I told her, brushing a strand of hair from her face.

"You should go home and get some sleep," she insisted. "You've been up all night."

Sleep was the furthest thing from my mind. I had other matters to attend to.

"I'll be back later," I promised, kissing her forehead before leaving.

James was waiting in the hallway, "The car's ready,sir."

Manhattan Club," I instructed as we exited the hospital. "Any updates?"

"We have Anna Watson in custody," James reported. "She insists she didn't put the snake there."

The subterranean level of Manhattan Club was a stark contrast to its
opulent public spaces. These rooms weren't in any floor plan, weren't known to the general membership.


Anna Watson dangled from the ceiling, her naked body suspended by thick, rusted chains that bit deep into her wrists and ankles. The coarse metal had torn through her skin, leaving jagged, weeping wounds that oozed blood in slow, crimson rivulets down her arms and legs. Her designer dress-or what was left of it-lay in a shredded pile on the concrete floor, hacked away by Landon's men with dull blades that had caught and torn her flesh in the process. Her pale skin glistened with sweat, streaked with dirt and blood, her once-pristine hair now a tangled,matted mess plastered to her face by tears and grime.

Her screams had long since turned into guttural, animalistic rasps,her throat raw after hours of unrelentingtorment. Landon's interrogation had been merciless. Deep, purpling bruises mottled her torso, thighs, and breasts-some so dark they looked black against her pallor-while jagged gashes crisscrossed her abdomen, the result of a serrated knife dragged slowly across her flesh. Blood pooled beneath her, dripping from her wrists. Her chest heaved unevenly, each breath a shuddering gasp that sprayed flecks of blood from her split lips.

I watched through the one-way glass, unmoved, twirling an unlit cigar between my fingers. June's pale face in that hospital bed flashed through my mind again. This woman had tried to kill my wife.

The door swung open, and Edward Lee strode in. His eyes widened slightly at the scene on the monitor.

"Mr. Lee!" James and Landon straightened immediately.

I merely looked at him. "What are you doing here?"
Edward's gaze flicked back to the monitor. "Haven't seen you this angry in years."

"If you're here to lecture me-"

"She's just a woman, Brandon," Edward cut in, gesturing toward the screen. "Don't you think this is excessive?"

My fingers tightened imperceptibly around the cigar. "Funny. I seem to recall you using similar methods on my sister's foster mother three years ago. What was your excuse then?"

A muscle twitched in Edward's jaw. We both knew exactly what I was referring to-the incident that had nearly fractured our friendship.

"That was different," he said tightly.

"Was it?" I raised an eyebrow. "Or is it just different when it's someone you care about?"

Edward's eyes flashed dangerously. "Brandon, don't push me. I'm not above knocking some sense into you."

A heavy silence fell between us. Unlike others, Edward wasn't afraid of me -which made himn both a valuable ally and a dangerous potential enemy.

"She's gone, Brandon," he finally said, his voice dropping. "Let it go."

We both knew he wasn't talking about Anna Watson anymore.

Edward continued, "Joe Watson is here looking for her now."

I considered this for a moment, then said to James. "Release Anna. Return her to her brother."
James looked surprised. "Sir? After what she did?"

"Tell him," I said, standing and straightening my jacket, "that if he can't control his sister, I'll be happy to continue teaching her manners for him."I paused, making sure James understood the weight of my next words."And terminate all contracts with Watson Group. Effective immediately."

"Yes,sir."

As James left to carry out my instructions, Edward gave me a long,assessing look. "Playing the long game, I see."

"Always."

Landon shifted uncomfortably under Edward's sudden scrutiny. "Landon,whose employee are you,exactly?"

Landon paled. "Yours, of course, Mr. Lee."

"Then why do I always find you here,following Brandon's orders?"

"Be careful," Edward warned mne. "Your grandfather doesn't know about your marriage yet, does he? You really want him finding out because you're making such a big deal out of this?"

"Someone has to pay, blood for blood," I stared coldly at him. "She's lucky enough that I haven't killed her."
###Chapter 110: Joe Watson

**Brandon's POV**

I caught Edward's narrow-eyed stare as we stood outside the hospital. His scrutiny was almost tangible in the silence between us.


"You know," he finally said, leaning against my car with practiced casualness, "there are more efficient ways to handle this."

I didn't respond. My thoughts were fixed on June's pale face in that hospital bed, the puncture wounds on her leg, the fever ravaging her body.Someone had tried to kill my wife.

Edward seemed to read my thoughts, sighing as he straightened his tie."Just remember, some messes are harder to clean up than others."

I shot him a sideways glance, my patience wearing thin. Edward caught my look and fell silent, checking his watch before making an excuse about a meeting.

I didn't care. I had more important matters to attend to.

\---

When I returned that afternoon, the antiseptic smell hit me immediately. I hated hospitals- the memories they stirred of my childhood, of Sarah's accident, of sterile roomas and hushed voices.

Now June was in one of those rooms.

Ruby's animated voice carried from June's VIP suite. "Victoria and Anna went way too far this time," she was saying, anger vibrating in her tone. "A fucking snake? If Chris hadn't shown up when he did..."
"I know," Scarlett replied, her usually soft voice harder than I'd ever heard."Victoria is supposed to be her sister. What kind of person does that to their own blood?"


I paused outside, listening as Ruby continued, "Summer's resting now. The doctor said she needs to sleep off the last of the antivenom. Let's go grab some coffee."


I stepped back as they exited without noticing me. They walked a few steps down before continuing their conversation.

"What do you want to do about it?" Scarlett asked directly. "Just tell me. I'm in."

Ruby nodded. "You always get me. I say we teach them a lesson they won't forget."

"That won't be necessary," I cut in.

Both women froze. Ruby's spine stiffened as she turned, eyes wide with surprise.

"Brandon?" she gasped. "I thought Summer said you went home to rest?"

I fixed her with a steady gaze. "I came to check on her."

Ruby fidgeted under my stare. "Oh, we should have been more careful.We should have stayed with her when she went to the bathroom." Her voice caught. "If we'd been more vigilant, she wouldn't have gotten hurt. I'm so sorry,Brandon."

I lifted a hand, cutting off her unnecessary apologies. "This isn't on you."

"June's situation will be handled," I added, my tone leaving no room for
discussion.′′Byme."

Understanding dawned in their eyes. Scarlett reached out to tug on Ruby's arm.


"We should go," she said quickly. "Brandon, Summer's all yours."

I stood outside June's door for several long moments, forcing the rage back down where it wouldn't disturb her. Only when I felt composed enough did I finally enter.

The room was dimly lit, afternoon sunlight filtering through partially drawn blinds. June lay on the bed, her dark hair spread across the white pillow, her face still too pale. A band of sunlight fell directly across her face,and even in sleep, she'd turned slightly away.

I crossed the room silently and pulled the curtains closed properly,watching as her brow immediately smoothed. Standing beside her bed.I found myself cataloging every detail of her face - the slight flush finally returning to her cheeks, the almost imperceptible flutter of her eyelashes.the soft parting of her lips with each breath.

My hand moved of its own accord, reaching to brush a strand of hair from her face. I stopped a hair's breadth from her skin, suddenly aware of how my touch might disturb her rest.

Instead, I withdrew, settling into the chair beside her bed.

I'd just sat down when I sensed movement at the door. Rising silently, I crossed the room and pulled it open before Sean could enter.

"Need something?" I asked coldly, blocking his view of June.

Sean raised an eyebrow, his usual smirk playing at his lps. "Just checking
on my patient.Doctor,remember?"

I didn't budge. "What do you want?"

Sean's eyes tried to peer around me. "I'm here to check on Summer. You know, make sure she's not dyig or anything."


I shifted, cutting off his view entirely. "Say what you need to say and go."

"Brandon, that's not very friendly...WHOA!"

My fist shot toward his face before he could finish. Sean dodged,barely,his reflexes saving him from a broken nose. He stumbled backward, a mixture of shock and amusement crossing his face.

"What the fuck, man?" he protested, dancing out of range as I advanced.

I didn't respond, just moved forward methodically, my next strike targeting his solar plexus. Sean twisted away again, buat I was already shifting, my third blow coming in low and fast.

We moved down the hallway - Sean backpedaling, me pursuing with single-minded focus. A small, rational part of my brain recognized I was being irrational, but the larger part didn't care.

"Okay, OKAY!" Sean finally shouted, hands raised. "Jesus Christ, Brandon!What happened to 'first, do no harm'? We're supposed to be friends!"

I paused, flexing my fingers. "Talk."

Sean straightened his rumpled shirt, eyeing me warily. "Joe Watson came to see me,"

I narrowed my eyes. "And?"
"He wanted my help," Sean explained, keeping a cautious distance. "to save his sister, obviously. Poor thing. But also as an intermediary.He doesn't realize it was you behind Anna's.,, situation. He thinks it's just Manhattan Club's boss being overzealous."

"He came to you specifically?"

"Yeah, playing the 'you owe me' card," Sean said with visible distaste."Because of that thing with your sister a few years back. He's hoping I can conhect him to you, and then you can smooth things over with the boss of Manhattan Club." Sean's lips quirked intoa humorless smile. "Little does he know."

"Did you agree?" I asked, my voice deadly quiet.

Sean shrugged. "Well, yeah. I hate owing people. But agreeing to help doesn't mean I promised results." Seeing my expression darken, he quickly added, "Look, I did tell him his sister fucked with your woman. So he knows exactly whose bad side he's on now."

Sean suddenly glanced over my shoulder. "Oh hey, Mrs. Stark is awake!"

I turned instinctively, only to find I was fooled. When I whipped back around, Sean was already halfway down the corridor.
###Chapter 111: How Dare You Cross Brandon St ark

**Anna's POV**

Pain. That's all I could feel-sharp, pulsing agony with every heartbeat.My wrists burned beneath the bandages, and I couldn't move without feeling like I was being torn apart all over again. The memories kept flashing behind my eyelids-being stripped naked, the cold metal chains biting into my flesh as they suspended me from the ceiling, my body exposed and vulnerable.

I could stil hear their voices, clinical and detached as they decided which part of me to hurt next. The humiliation burned worse than the physical pain,knowing those men had seen me like that, helpless and begging. I'd never felt so violated, so utterly degraded in my entire life.

"Get your hands off me!" I screamed as the nurse tried to change my dressings. "Just leave me alone!"

"Miss Watson, please," the nurse begged, her voice sickly sweet and patronizing. "These wounds will get infected if-"

"Like you care!" I thrashed against her grip, ignoring how it made my vision blur with pain. "All of you can go to hell!"

The doctor stepped closer, syringe in hand. "You must calm yourself-"

"Calm? CALM?" I laughed hysterically. "After what they did to me? Get out! GET OUT!"

The door slammed open with enough force to make everyone freeze.Joe stood there, his face a thundercloud.
"Enough," he said, his voice dangerously quiet. "That's enough, Anna."

I instantly fell silent. Joe rarely used that tone with me, and when he did,it meant real trouble.


"Joe," I whispered, suddenly feeling like a little girl again.

He turned to the medical staff. "Could you give us a few minutes?"

They couldn't leave fast enough. As the door closed, Joe stared at me like I was a stranger.

"Feeling better?" he asked coldly.

"How could I possibly feel better?" Tears sprang to my eyes-real ones this time. "Look what they did to me, Joe! Why aren't you more upset?Why aren't you ready to destroy whoeverdid this to me?"

Joe sat on the edge of my bed, studying my bandaged wrists."Do you know who Brandon Stark is?"

The name hit me like ice water. "What? What does he have to do with anything?"

"According to Sean, everything." Joe's eyes bored into mine. "He claims Brandon Stark personally ordered what happened to you."

"That's insane," I said, genuinely confused. "I didn't even spoke to Brandon Stark. I mean, I might've seen him at some event or whatever,but we don't exactly run in the same circles."

"That's what I thought." Joe frowned. "Which leaves me wondering what you did that would make someone like Brandon Stark take a personal interest in hurting my sister."
"Nothing!" I insisted, panic rising in my throat as I remembered the cold eyes watching from behind the glass. "Joe, I swear!"


"Anna." His voice dropped to a whisper. "I can't help you if you lie to me.What happened at the reunion?"


I hesitated, weighing my options. Joe was my only ally, and he'd walk if he caught me in a lie.

"Fine." I sighed. "There was this girl there, Summer Taylor."


"Victoria's sister?" Joe frowned.

"Yeah. She's always been a problem-stealing boyfriends,causing drama.I just wanted to teach her a lesson."

"What kind of lesson?" Joe's voice was dangerously soft.

I looked away. "I might have... had someone lock her in the bathroom."


"And?"

"I didn't know they were going to put a snake in there..."

"A SNAKE?" Joe exploded. "Are you out of your mind? People die from snakebites,Anna!"

"How was I supposed to know they'd bring something venomous?"I protested.

Joe rubbed his temples. "So you locked Victoria's sister in a bathroom with a snake because... what? You don't like her?"

"It's more than that," I insisted. "She's always been a manipulative bitch.In college, she stole my boyfriend, and now she's trying to mess with
Victoria's engagement too!"

"That still doesn't explain why Brandon Stark would care." Joe paced the small room.


I bit my lip, thinking hard. "I don't understand. Why would Brandon Stark care about what happens to Victoria's pathetic little sister? Unless they are close?"

Joe headed for the door. "I don't know, but I intend to find out. Rest. I'll be back."

"You promise?" I hated how weak I sounded.

"Yes. But Anna?" His eyes hardened. "If I find out you're hiding anything else..."

The door closed behind him, leaving me alone with my thoughts and the relentless pain. I stared at the ceiling, trying to make sense of it all. The flashbacks hit me again-them cutting away my designer dress with dull blades that sliced into my skin, the endless questions,watching my naked body... I'd screamed until my throat was raw, begged until I had no dignity left. The shame of it crushed down on me like a physical weight.

My fingers fumbled for my phone. If anyone could help me, it was Victoria.

After three rings, Victoria finally answered. "Anna? Oh my god, are you okay?"

"I'm... I'm out of that place," I said, relief washing over me at hearing her voice. "Joe got me out."

"Thank goodness!" Victoria exclaimed, though something in her tone felt
off. "I was so worried when they took you away!"

"Victoria, about last night-"

"I'm so sorry I couldn't help you!" she interrupted. "Those security guys were intense! I tried, but they wouldn't listen to anyone."

I swallowed my irritation. I needed her too much to call her out on the obvious lie.

"It's fine. Victoria, I need your help now. Your fiancé's uncle is Brandon Stark, right? Could you ask Alexander to talk to him? To make him leave me alone?"

There was a long pause. "Brandon Stark? Why would he be involved?"

"I don't know," I admitted. "But Joe says he's behind this. Please, Victoria.
I know Alexander and Brandon aren't close, but maybe just this once-"

"Anna, honey," Victoria cut me off, her voice suddenly cool, "you know I'd help if I could, but Brandon barely acknowledges Alexander exists. And he's not exactly the type of guy you just ask for favors."

"But Victoria-"

"Plus, why would Brandon Stark care about what happened to you? It doesn't make sense."

"Maybe because of Summer?" I ventured. "Is there something going on between them?"

"What?" Victoria actually laughed. "Where did you get that idea? Look,I've got fittings all afternoon. Wedding stuff, you know? I'll call you later,okay?"
"Victoria,please-"

"Feel better!" And she hung up.

I stared at the phone in disbelief. After everything I'd done for her? After putting myself on the line to help her deal with Summer? This was how she repaid me?

"Victoria!" I hissed, squeezing the phone so hard my knuckles turned white.
###Chapter 112: Victoria's True Colors

**Joe's POV**

"Sir, we've lost another thirty percent since market open." My CFO's voice trembled through the phone. "Someone's aggressively buying our shares.Nearly a third of Watson Group has changed hands in the last hour alone."

I didn't need to ask who was behind it. There was only one person with this kind of financial firepower and precision. Brandon Stark. This was about Anna.


"Call an emergency board meeting," I ordered, already loosening my tie."And get my car ready. I'm going to Stark Tower."

The boardroom was chaos when I stopped by-panicked executives shouting over each other as our stock continued its free fall. I cut through the noise with a raised hand.

"I know who's behind this, and I'm going to fix it."

"Who, Joe?" Our senior director demanded.

"Brandon Stark," I replied, watching their faces pale collectively. The name alone was enough to silence the room.

No one tried to stop me as I headed for the door. They knew as well as I did-when Brandon Stark decided to destroy you, your options became very limited, very quickly.




The gleaming lobby of Stark Tower felt like entering a different world.I was escorted immediately to the executive floor-a small mercy I hadn't
expected.

James Wilson, Brandon's right-hand man, met me outside the conference room. "Mr. Stark is finishing a meeting. He'll be with you shortly."

Through the glass, I watched Brandon at the head of the table,commanding the room without raising his voice. I'd admired him once,before he became my executioner.

My phone vibrated with another catastrophic update: "Stock down 42%now. Creditors calling in loans. What do we do???"

I switched it to silent just as Brandon emerged.

James hurried to catch up with his boss.

"Mr. Watson," Brandon addressed me. "Follow me."

The private meeting room offered a panoramic view of Manhattan-a reminder of just how far we could fall.

"Mr. Stark." I began immediately, skipping pleasantries. "I understand you're behind the attack on Watson Group."

He didn't deny it. "It seems your sister hasn't told you the full story."

"I'm here to make amends for whatever Anna did,"I said,fighting to keep desperation from my voice.

"Your sister is close with Victoria Taylor?"' The question seemed casual,but nothing with Brandon Stark ever was.

"Anna's social circle is quite extensive," I replied carefully. "I've heard her mention Victoria, but I generally don't involve myself in her friendships."
"Then as her brother, you've been negligent," Brandon's eyes narrowed. "Some people are worth knowing. Others should be avoided at all costs. Do you understand what I'm saying?"

The threat wasn't even thinly veiled.

"Completely," I answered quickly.

"Mr. Watson, I dislike wasting words. I'm willing to spare Watson Group and even overlook what your sister did. But I have one condition."

My pulse quickened. "Nameit."

"It's quite simple," he replied. "Your sister needsto help me with something one day."

"What would that be?" I echoed, genuinely confused.

Brandon exchanged a look with James and left, regarding me with cold calculation.

"Perhaps you're unaware," James began, sliding a folder across the table."Your sister arranged for someone to teach Summer Taylor a lesson.However, someone else introduced a venomous snake into the situation."

My blood ran cold as I scanned the documents-surveillance photos,medical reports, statements.

"A venomous snake, Mr. Watson," James continued softly. "If found too late, we'd be discussing a fatality. And your sister would be facing very different consequences."

"Whatever Mr. Stark wants, I'lI do it," I said, abandoning pretense. "Just tell me what he needs."
"If I may ask." I ventured carefully, "what is Summer Taylor's relationship to Mr. Stark?"

James's smile turned glacial. "Mr. Watson, there are things you need to know, and things you should pretend not to know even if you do. I suggest you determine which category this falls into."

Message received. "Understood."

Outside the Stark Group, my father called. "Son, the buying spree just stopped.Whatever you did in there, it worked. Come home immediately."

I dialed Anna's number on the way.

"Hello?" Her voice sounded small.

"Anna, I need you to come home," I said evenly, despite my simmering anger.

"How is the company?" she asked.

"Watson Group is secure for now," I replied. "Now come home."

"But Summer-that bitch ruined everything!" she began petulantly.

"Enough!" I snapped. "You're still blaming Summer? I've seen the evidence. You're a grown woman-start acting like one."

"But Joe-"

"We'll discuss this at home," I ended the call.

Mother was fussing over Anna when I arrived. "My poor baby. That awful Brandon Stark-"
"Mom," I interrupted, "this isn't Brandon Stark's fault. It's Anna's."

"Joe!" Mother looked scandalized.

Father entered, his expression grim. "Margaret, enough. If Joe hadn't leveraged that old promise from Brandon, Watson Group would be finished."


He turned to Anna. "Antagonizing Brandon Stark? Have you lost your mind?"

"Daddy, I didn't--" Anna began tearfully.

"You want to know why Brandon came after you?" I pulled out James's file. "Take a look at your so-called friend Victoria. See what kind of person you've been defending."

Anna staredI at the documents. "What is this?"

"Evidence," I replied coldly. "You said you were just 'teaching Summer a lesson,' buit why? What did she ever do to you? These reports show a pattern-you harassing Summer, with Victoria always benefiting."

Anna's hands trembled as she looked at the file.

"This...this can't be right," she whispered. "Victoria is my best friend..."

"I'm warning you," I continued, "stay away from Victoria and Sophie. And Summer? Leave her alone. You still don't understand why Brandon Stark got involved, do you?"

Anna's head snapped up. "You mean Summer's fucking Brandon Stark?"

"Shut up!" I roared, genuinely frightened by her recklessness. "Whatever her relationship with Brandon might be, it's not for us to discuss-unless
you want Watson Group destroyed. Do you understand me?"

Anns nodded mutely, for once rendered completely speechless.
###Chapter 113: Touch Me
Summer's POV
I curled deeper into the bedroom armchair, pulling my sweater tighter as I tried to focus on my novel, but the words kept blurring together.
Two weeks since the snake incident, and Brandon had turned into an overprotective guardian. He wouldn't let me do a single household chore—not even loading the dishwasher. Every time I reached for a dirty plate, Brandon would materialize to take it from my hands and give me that commanding look.
I felt useless. And the worst part? I was starting to enjoy being pampered.
The clock showed nearly midnight. Brandon was still in his study working, as usual. My phone buzzed—Grandpa George calling.
"Grandpa!" I greeted. "Everything okay?"
"I'm good." His gruff voice carried its usual blend of affection and impatience. "Victoria and Alexander's wedding is the day after tomorrow."
My stomach did a strange little flip at the names, not from jealousy but from instinct—hearing the two people who had betrayed me so thoroughly.
"Yeah, I know," I replied casually. "I got the invitation."
"Are you doing alright with that?" Concern laced his words. "I know it can't be easy."
I almost laughed at his worry. Alexander and Victoria seemed like characters from another lifetime now. "Grandpa, I'm completely fine," I assured him. "Honestly, they could get married on the moon and I wouldn't care."
"You sound sincere," he admitted, "but sometimes these things hit us in ways we don't expect."
My heart squeezed with affection for this man who'd always looked out for me. "I love you for caring, Grandpa. But trust me, I'm good. Better than good, actually."
After hanging up, I sat there thinking about his concern. A few months ago, news of their wedding would have devastated me. But now? They were just people who once hurt me but no longer had the power to affect my happiness.
I headed downstairs to the kitchen and prepared some ginger tea. Brandon had been working too hard lately, and though he'd never admit it, I'd noticed the slight roughness in his voice.
Cup in hand, I made my way to his study, finding the door slightly ajar. Brandon sat behind his massive desk, surrounded by documents, his laptop casting a blue glow across his face. He looked up the moment I entered, those dark eyes instantly finding mine.
"You're still up," he said, attention immediately shifting from work to me.
"How do you always do that? I barely made a sound."
"I felt you," he replied simply.
I rolled my eyes. "Right. Your Brandon-sense was tingling." The corner of his mouth quirked up in that dangerous half-smile. "Why aren't you in bed?"
"Couldn't sleep," I said, setting the mug on his desk. "Thought you might want some tea."
Brandon eyed it suspiciously. "Is that ginger tea? I'm not sick."
"It's practically winter, and you're working late. Again. Just drink it."
To my surprise, he picked up the mug without further protest and drank the entire thing. I moved behind him, my hands settling on his shoulders. His muscles were tight with tension beneath my fingers.
"You work too hard," I murmured, thumbs pressing gently against his temples. Brandon's eyes drifted closed as he relaxed into my touch. "Almost done. Just a few more details."
I took in the fine lines at the corners of his eyes. Running Stark Group wasn't just a job—it was his entire life.
"Brandon, doesn't it exhaust you? Managing all these different companies?"
"It's fine," he replied, leaning further into my touch. His hand captured mine suddenly, tugging me around the chair and into his lap.
"June," he murmured, voice low in the quiet study. "Are you worried about me?"
"No," I lied. "I'm just thinking that if even you don't care about your own health, why should I bother?"
"Who says I don't care?" Brandon's eyes were serious. "I'm very invested in my wellbeing."
"Right," I scoffed. "That's why you work until midnight and forget to eat lunch half the time."
He smiled, tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. "I have you to remind me now. You came to my study this late. Was there something you wanted to talk about?"
I bit my lip. "Actually, yes. I was thinking we should visit Grandpa George soon? Officially, I mean. He's worried that the wedding might upset me. I want him to see that I really am happy now. With you."
A subtle tension tightened Brandon's jaw. I couldn't help but smile. "Are you jealous? Of Alexander?"
"Jealous? What's that?" He captured my hand, his gaze darkening with a sudden, intense heat. "I don't need to be jealous of a shadow from your past when I have the reality of you right here."
Outside, waves crashed against the shore. The study was warm, the lamp casting a golden glow that shrunk the world down to just the two of us.
"I want to make it official," I whispered, leaning in.
His hands found my waist, pulling me closer until there was no space left between us. "You pick the day," he promised, his voice dropping to a low, husky rasp that sent a shiver down my spine. "I'm all yours."
As his lips met mine, the papers on the desk were forgotten. The air in the study thickened with a sudden, overwhelming tension—not of work, but of a deep, undeniable longing. In the quiet of the night, every touch felt amplified, a silent promise of the passion that bound us together, far more powerful than any words could describe.




###Chapter 114: That Was Your Fault!

"June," Brandon rasped, his hands possessive as they found my waist, pulling me flush against him. The air in the study was thick, charged with an intensity that made the room feel small. He looked at me with a gaze that was raw and unfiltered, his eyes searching mine until my breath hitched in my throat.
I reached for the buttons of his shirt, my fingers trembling slightly. The world outside—the clock ticking midnight, the distant sound of the waves—all of it faded. There was only the warmth of his skin and the rhythmic thrum of his heart against my palms.
As the silk gave way, I traced the hard planes of his chest, my touch light against his skin. He let out a low sound, a breath of pure, unadulterated longing that sent a fresh wave of heat through me. In the golden glow of the desk lamp, every touch felt amplified, every whisper a spark to a growing fire.
He lifted me effortlessly, settling me on the desk among the scattered papers. The contrast of the cool mahogany against my skin and the searing heat of his presence was overwhelming. We lost ourselves in a whirlwind of shared breath and whispered promises, a desperate, beautiful collision of two people who had spent too long holding back.
The hours blurred into a haze of shadows and light. The study became a sanctuary where the only language we spoke was one of connection and need. It was fierce, unyielding, and completely all-consuming—a private world built just for the two of us.
Finally, as the first hint of pre-dawn light began to touch the windows, Brandon scooped me up. His arms were steady as he carried me toward the bathroom. The warm water felt like a blessing as it cascaded over us, washing away the traces of our long night. He was tender now, his hands soft as he helped me clean up, his eyes never leaving mine. He dried me gently and tucked me into bed, his soft whispers the last thing I heard before sleep finally claimed me.
I woke feeling like I'd spent the night cuddled against a human furnace. Brandon was still asleep beside me—a rare sight. Usually, he was up before dawn, dressed and working before I even opened my eyes.
There was something fascinating about watching him sleep. All that intensity, all that power, temporarily subdued by unconsciousness. Brandon was always gentle with me, but I'd seen glimpses of the ruthless businessman everyone feared—the Wall Street shark who could destroy companies with a single phone call.
But right now? He looked almost at peace. I propped myself up on my elbows, watching his expression with amusement.
His eyelids snapped open suddenly, that predatory alertness instantly present. But when he registered my face, the sharpness in his gaze softened immediately.
"Awake already?" His voice was deliciously rough with sleep, a low rumble that vibrated through me.
I felt a flutter of shyness, like I'd been caught in a private moment. I nodded, about to slide out of bed when his arm snaked around my waist, pulling me back against his chest.
"It's the weekend," he said, his chin grazing my cheek as his fingers traced my jawline. "Let's sleep in. You were so exhausted that you fell asleep the moment your head hit the pillow last night."
Heat rushed to my face as the memories of the study flooded back. I bit my lip, giving him an accusatory look. "That was your fault!"
I reached back to massage my lower back, wincing slightly at the soreness that radiated through my muscles. Brandon noticed and chuckled, his eyes glinting with amusement. "What are you thinking about?"
I slipped my hand under the hem of his shirt, pinching his waist in retaliation. "I'm thinking about when I should banish you back to the guest room. You seemed perfectly comfortable there before." I tried to look fierce, gritting my teeth for effect.
###Chapter 115: I'll Protect Summer Forever

**Summer's POV**

I pinched Brandon's waist repeatedly,twisting my fingers until they ached.Nothing. Not even a flinch.


"Seriously? You don't feel any pain at all?" I complained, flexing my tired fingers.


Brandon raised an eyebrow, his gaze dropping to my lips as he cupped my face. "Oh, it hurts. Does June want to kiss it better?"


Heat rushed to my face as I shoved at his chest. "God, can you be serious for five seconds?"


He laughed before flipping me onto my back in one smooth motion, arms bracketing my head. That maddening half-smile played at his lips as he looked down at me.

"Brandon, it's getting late. We should-"

"You're right," he agreed. "It is late. June, your stamina is terrible. I think we need to start a new morning workout routine...every day."

After our "workout," I rested my head on his shoulder, rebellious enough to nip at the curve where his neck met his shoulder.

Brandon drew in a sharp breath. "June, you're playing with fire."

I froze instantly. "No more,please,Brandon!"

His expression softened as he pressed a gentle kiss to my eye. "I'm just messing with you."
He reminded me, "Get dressed. We need to head downstairs. Don't forget we're visiting your grandfather today."


"Oh my god, Grandpa George!" My eyes widened in horror as I smacked his chest. "I almost forgot!" I bit my lip anxiously. "I haven't even prepared a gift!"

Brandon caught my hand. "Hey, relax. It's fine. Just get dressed. We'll handle everything downstairs."

Downstairs, I was surprised to see James standing in our living room,looking like he'd been there for hours.

"James? What are you doing here?"

"Ill leave you two to talk while I make us something to eat," I added quickly.

Before I could escape, Brandon's hand closed around mine. "Don't go overboard. Something simple is fine."

I nodded, trying to free myself as James suddenly found the ceiling absolutely fascinating.

"I'm going!" I finally yanked my hand free, feeling my cheeks warm.

By the time I finished preparing breakfast and returned to the living room,James was gone.

"Where's James?" I asked, setting down a plate of French toast.

Brandon looked up from his newspaper. "He left. Did you need him for something?"

I shook my head. "Just seems harsh to call him in on a weekend."
"Trust me, with what I pay James, he's not suffering," Brandon said,eyeing the full breakfast spread. "I thought I said something simple would be fine."


I shot him a look. "It's practically noon! And whose fault is that?"




Per Se's manager rushed to greet us the moment we arrived.

"Mr. Stark, everything is prepared exactly as you requested. We've been closed to other patrons since noon."

My jaw nearly dropped. Brandon had booked the entire Per Se? For a family lunch?

Once we were alone in the VIP room, Brandon guided me to a plush sofa.sitting close enough that our thighs touched. He took my hand, placing it on his knee and absently playing with my fingers-a habit I'd noticed developing over the past few weeks.

A gentle knock interrupted us.

"Mr. Taylor has arrived," the manager announced.

I jumped to my feet, pulling Brandon uup with me. "Grandpa!"

George Taylor entered slowly, leaning on his cane with Parker hovering at his side. His sharp gaze swept over me before turning to Brandon with frank assessment.

Brandon met the scrutiny head-on. "Mr. Taylor."

Grandpa's eyes narrowed thoughtfully before his face broke into a smile."Good,good!"
I let go of Brandon's hand to take my grandfather's arm. "Grandpa. Come sit down!"


Once settled, I babbled nervously. "Grandpa, you remember Brandon, right?He came to your birthday party and gave you that antique chess set-the really beautiful one? Remember?"

"My pleasure, Mr. Taylor." Brandon greeted again.

Grandpa patted my hand affectionately. "Of course I remember him! Do you think your old grandpa's gone senile, young lady?" His eyes turned back to Brandon with unmistakable approval.

"You rascal," he said to me. "Getting married without telling your grandfather! Such an important event..."

"But we're telling you now!" I cut in, snuggling closer to his arm. "You were sick, Grandpa. I didn't want to worry you. Anyway, Brandon treats me very well!"

Grandpa chuckled. "Listen to this girl, not a shred of shyness!" His gaze shifted between us. "What about your maernal grandfather? Have you introduced Brandon to Jonathan? His temper isn't as forgiving as mine."

"We've met," I assured him. "And yes, Grandpa Jonathan wasn't exactly...thrilled at first."

I leaned closer, whispering: "Actually, Grandpa Jonathan found out from someone else. He was pretty angry. It took a lot of work to smooth things over."

Grandpa turned to Brandon. "So you managed to win over the old professor,did you?"
Brandon smiled slightly. "Thank you for your concern, Grandpa. Yes, we've cleared things with Professor Thompson. That's why we're here today-to get your blessing as well."

"Well," Grandpa said bluntly, "I'm an easy old man to please. As long as you're good to my Summer, everything else is secondary."


His expression softened as he looked at me, something like old pain flickering in his eyes. "You know Summer's situation. I'Il be frank with you,young man. My granddaughter has endured enough hardship in her life.I only have one request-be good to her. Treat her well, for all her days."

Brandon's expréssion turned solemn, his voice carrying absolute conviction.
"Of course. I married June because I want her in my life. As for her past troubles... those are inconsequential now. She's my wife, and I'll protect her forever.

Under the table, I reached for Brandon's hand, our fingers intertwining as naturally as breathing.

I could tell Grandpa was impressed with Brandon. My situation needed someone strong for protection, and Brandon was perfect for that role.

"Let me be blunt about one thing," Grandpa said. "That Alexander..."

"You're concerned about family complications?" Brandon replied smoothly."In families likethe Starks, things can get... complex."

Grandpa's eyes lit up, clearly impressed by Brandon's perceptiveness.

"Don't worry," Brandon assured him. "As I told Professor Thompson.June won't face any hardships as my wife."

Even though they'd never directly worked together, Grandpa had heard
about Brandon in business circles-a standout among his generation.

"One last question," Grandpa asked. "Has Summer met your family yet?"

Brandon's eyebrow arched slightly, but before he could answer, I jumped in.

"We thought we should visited you and Grandpa Jonathan first," I explained.

The atmosphere instantly tensed. I realized my mistake too late.

Brandon squeezed my hand. "June, why don't you check on the meal preparations?"

I bit my lip, glancing uncertainly between them. "I..."

"Go on, sweetheart," he urged gently. "You knowyour grandfather's preferences better than I do."

I nodded reluctantly. "Okay, fine." I let go of his hand and headed for the door, leaving the two most important men in my life to speak privately.
###Chapter 116: I've Known Summer for a Long Time

**Brandon's POV**

The moment June left the private dining room, George Taylor's demeanor shifted. The warm, indulgent grandfather vanished, replaced by the shrewd businessman who'd built Taylor Enterprises from nothing.

"Mr. Stark, care to explain yourself?" His voice was level but carried unmistakable weight.

I didn't rush to answer. This wasn't like dealing with Jonathan Thompson,who wore his displeasure openly. George Taylor was more measured,more strategic.

I reached for the teapot, pouring a fresh cup. "Please, call me Brandon."

"Actually, I've known Summer for a long time," I began, setting down the teapot. "You might not be aware, but her maternal grandfather,Jonathan Thompson, was my mentor at Columbia. I've met Summer before."

George's eyebrow arched. "So you're saying your feelings for my granddaughter weren't formed overnight?"

"You could say that," I acknowledged. "Though Summer barely remembers meeting me back then."

Something shifted in George's expression.

"I won't pretend I've been entirely forthright about this marriage," I admitted. "But know this-I care deeply for June. I'll protect her, always."I paused. "Our marriage came about through... circumstances. But
sometimes the best things happen unexpectedly."

George's face darkened at my subtle reference to what June had endured."
You know about the Taylor family situation."

It wasn't a question.

"I believe your decision to give Summer those Capital Corp shares was both protective and strategic," I said, meeting his gaze directly. "You wanted to shield her while preserving the family's foundation."

George nodded slowly. "You have remarkable insight, Brandon.My granddaughter chose well."

"But have you considered," I ventured, "that some responsibilities aren't suited for Summer to bear?"

George sighed heavily. "Of course I have. I never wanted to drag her into Taylor family politics." He gripped his cane tighter. "But when I'm gone,what then? Who protects her? The shares give her leverage, a voice that can't be silenced."

"Some burdens aren't appropriate for her," I stated firmly. "Not now,not ever."


I leaned forward. "I'm making you a promise right now. What she shouldn't handle, I will handle for her."

George's eyes widened slightly. "You're quite confident, young man."

"I have reason to be."

He studied me for a long moment, then chuckled. "And here I was,worrying about Summer facing mny son and Victoria. Perhaps my concerns
were...unnecessary."

"Our marriage had practical elements," I acknowledged. "Not my preference, but reality nonetheless. As for the Stark family, June will meet them when she's ready. Your other concerns..." I let my voice drop slightly."Consider them handled."


George's smile broadened. "Excellent. Take care of my girl, Brandon."

Then I opened the door and saw June was pacing outside, her forehead creased with worry. Parker watched her with barely concealed amusement.

She startled, then quickly composed herself, stepping toward me. She slipped her hand into mine.

"Are you two finished? What did Grandpa say? He didn't give you a hard time, did he?" The questions tumbled out. "I'm sorry about earlier-"

George rose from his chair, feigning indignation. "What exactly could I hold against Brandon? You make your grandfather sound like some unreasonable old tyrant!"

June's blush deepened. "Grandpa, you're teasing me!"

George laughed heartily. "Look at your husband-does he look like he's been through an interrogation? My granddaughter gets married, and suddenly she's taking her husband's side over her dear old grandfather!"

June stomped her foot lightly, turning to me. "And you! What are you smiling about? This is all your fault!"

I couldn't help but smile wider, gently patting her hand. "Hungry? Let's eat."
The meal progressed smoothly. June kept glancing between George and me with curiosity, clearly wondering what had transpired. Meanwhile, George and I discussed Wall Street trends-topics that quickly had June tuning out.


I noticed her plate emptying and automatically reached over to add more shrimp, knowing her preference. Without breaking my conversation with George,I peeled the shrimp for her, removing the tails. When she finished her water, I refilled her glass before she could reach for the pitcher.


These small gestures caught George's attention more than our financial discussion. His eyes softened each time I anticipated June's needs. This wasn't just a grandfather concerned about a marriage-this was a man who recognized genuine care.

June, distracted by her curiosity, didn't notice she was eating far more than usual. Each time I placed food on her plate, she absently consumed it.her mind elsewhere.




"Brandon, I can manage perfectly well on my own," George insisted as Jamnes loaded several packages into the Taylor family car.

"I'm sure you can," I agreed smoothly, "but it would be my pleasure."

George finally relented, shaking his head. "You're persistent, I'll give you that."

After watching the Taylor car disappear, June immediately turned to me.eyes bright.

"What did you say to Grandpa? He was practically glowing by the end of lunch!"
I tapped her nose playfully. "I told you I'd handle everything. You're not very patient,are you?"

"That's not an answer," she protested, but there was no real heat in her words.

I took her hand. "How about a walk? The weather's perfect."

She frowned slightly, patting her stomach. "You kept putting food on my plate. I think I ate twice my normal amount! If I keep eating like this, I'm definitely going to gain weight."

I appraised her slim figure, reaching up to squeeze her cheek gently. "That's not a bad thing. A little more curve would be nice. Makes you more comfortable to hold."

Her cheeks flushed. "Be serious! I'm asking about my grandfather, and you're changing the subject!"

I sighed, pulling her into my arms. My fingers threaded through her soft hair.

"I said I'd take care of everything, and I will," I murmured against the top of her head. "What your grandfather and I discussed... that's between us men. Some things you can leave to me, okay?"

I felt her relax against my chest, her arms tightening around my waist as she nodded."Okay."

She understood what I wasn't saying-that when the time was right, I would tell her. That's who June was-sharp enough to read between the lines, trusting enough to knów I wouldn't withhold anything truly important.
As we walked, her hand safely tucked in mine, I thought about George Taylor's words: "Take care of my girl." The simplicity of the request belied its weight-it wasn't just about protecting June physically or financially. It was about giving her the love and stability she'd never fully had.
###Chapter 117: The Truth About That Night

**Summer's POV**

Fifth Avenue glittered under the autumn sun as I window-shopped,enjoying a rare afternoon to myself. Åfter the snake incident, Brandon had been so overprotective that I'd practically had to fight for my independence.

I was admiring a display of designer shoes when I spotted their reflection in the window-Anna Watson and her mother, stepping out of Bergdorf Goodman. My body tensed instantly. This was the first time I'd seen Anna since the Manhattan Club disaster.

What caught my attention were the two angry red scars running down the left side of her otherwise perfect face-one from temple to cheek, the other across her jawline. I quickly turned away, hoping they hadn't noticed me,but it was too late.


"Summer." Her voice carried clearly across the sidewalk.

I reluctantly turned. "Anna."

Her mother's arm tightened protectively around her daughter's shoulders,eyeing me with undisguised hostility.

"Have you got a minute?" Anna asked. "I think we should talk."

I raised an eyebrow. "You want to talk to me? I don't think we have anything to discuss."

Anna's fingers touched one of her scars.′′Don't you want to know why you got bitten by that snake? And about my face..."

I hesitated, weighing my options. Brandon would lose his mind if he
knew I was even considering this conversation.

"Fine," I finally said, checking my watch. "But I don't have much time.My friend's meeting me soon."

Anna turned to her mother. "Mom, I need to talk to Summer alone. Why don't you head back?"


"Anna, I don't think-"

"It's okay, Mom. If you're worried, you can wait in the car. I'll be right there."

After her mother reluctantly left, Anna gestured toward Madison Avenue."There's a café just around the corner. We can talk there."

The café was exactly the kind of upscale place that charged twelve dollars for an espresso. I ordered a lime water while Anna chose some complicated tea concoction.

"Well?" I prompted once we were alone. "You wanted to talk, so talk."

Anna's jaw tightened. "God, Summer, that whole unbothered, above-it-all attitude of yours is really fucking annoying, you know that?"

I raised an eyebrow. "Is it? Well,you don't like me. You've never liked me.So anything I do, you're not going to like. But your opinion? Honestly doesn't affect me at all."

Her face flushed, caught off guard by my directness.

I sighed. "Look, you said you wanted to talk about what happened that night. There's indeed a lot things that I don't know. And your face..."

"Who are you, really?" she blurted out. "What kind of connections do you
have?"

*Brandon. She's talking about Brandon.* My mind raced.

"I'm nobody special," I replied carefully. "If that's what you wanted to ask,I don't have an answer for you."


"That's bullshit," Anna leaned forward. "Nobody gets that kind of response from Manhattan Club security unless they're seriously connected."

Her fingers brushed one of her scars again.

"You know what's funny? I didn't even hate you at first. It was only after I started hanging with Victoria that I began to see what a bitch you were to her."


"Excuse me?" I nearly choked. "When exactly was I ever a bitch to Victoria?"


"Are you serious? Victoria told us how you constantly undermined her.She's your older sister, and you treated her like garbage!"

I couldn't help but laugh. "Wow. That's rich. Which eye did you use to see me supposedly bullying her? I've spent my entire life in Victoria's shadow."

"She always looked so hurt whenever you were around," Anna said,her certainty wavering. "You'd give her these cold looks..."

"You mean when she'd deliberately seek me out to make snide comments disguised as sisterly concern?" I countered. "Or when she'd publicly'apologize' just to make herseIf look good?"

Anna fell silent, her expression troubled.
"I've often wonddered why we can't act like sisters," I continued. "What exactly did I do that made everyone think I was the problem?"

"So you're saying you don't hate each other?" she asked skeptically.

"No. we definitely don't get along," I clarified. "But has Victoria ever, even once, said anything nice about me to you? If she truly saw me as her sister,wouldn't she occasionally have something positive to say?"

Anna's gaze dropped to the table. The silence was answer enough.

"Look," I checked my watch. "Why don't you tell me why you really wanted to talk?"

Anna took a deep breath. "The snake. It wasn't me who had it put there."Her voice was quiet but firm. "I arranged to have you locked in the bathroom. That's it. I never meant for there to be a snake."

She gestured at her face. "I've paid for it, though. Look at me. My modeling career is over before it even began."

"So?" My voice was cold. "What exactly do you want fromn me?Sympathy?"

*I'm not a monster, but I'm not a saint either. This woman was willing to lock me in a bathroom to "teach me a lesson." Snake or no snake, she put me in danger.*

"I'm apologizing," Anna said, a hint of desperation in her voice. "But I've been punished too, My brother says I should stay away from you, that you're too dangerous to mess with. So who are you, Summer?"

I studied her for a long momenț. "Who Lam isn't important. What matters is that you're here talking to me now, which means you've figured out some things for yourself, right?"
Anna nodded slowly. "Victoria isn't who I thought she was. And whatever is between you two... I don't want to be in the middle anymore. I just want this to be over."


"I understand," I said softly. "And for what it's worth, I'm not some heartless monster out for revenge. What happened to you wasn't my doing.11


"But you know who did it," shestated.

"As for whether I have someone powerful behind me," I continued,ignoring her statement, "trust me when I say you're better off not knowing.
11

As I stood to leave, a thought struck me.

"Anna, do you remember back in college when you received that love letter? The one you thought was from Chris Diaz, but he later said was meant for me?"

Her expression darkened. "What about it?"

"That letter was meant for me," I said gently. "But I never saw it. Chris gave it to Victoria to pass to me. And somehow, it found its way to you instead."

Anna's eyes widened as understanding dawned. "She wouldn't have... but of course she would."


I nodded, turning to leave.

"Wait," she called after me."Victoria and Alexander's wedding is the day after tomorrow. Will you be there?"
###Chapter 118: Letting Go of the Past

Summer's POV

"Why not?" I said.

"You're saying you don't mind going to Victoria and Alexander's wedding?" Anna's voice dripped with disbelief as she leaned across the small cafétable. "The guy was your fiancé! Don't you hate them? Don't you want him back?"


I stared into my lime water, watching the slice bob up and down.

"Honestly? No," I replied, meeting her gaze. "I've realized Victoriaand Alexander actually deserve each other."


Anna's nails tapped against the marble tabletop, her scars standing out starkly against her pale complexion-two angry red lines that would never fade.

"I don't get you," she said. "How can you be so... calm about this?"

A flicker of surprise crossed my face before I settled into something more serene. What I didn't say was that I'd found someone infinitely better.Brandon had shown me what it meant to be truly loved.

"Well, well, look who it is."

I turned to find Ruby standing there, arms crossed, Scarlett slightly behind her.

"Huh, seems like you didn't learn your lesson, Anna. Looking to cause more trouble?" Ruby's tone could have frozen hell itself.
Anna tensed. "What's that supposed to mean, Ruby?"

"Oh. I think you know exactly what I mean." Ruby stepped closer."If you try anything against Summer again, I'll be the first in line to make you regret it."


"Whoa, Ruby, stop!" I jumped in, grabbing her arm. "Anna's not doing anything wrong. We literally just bumped into each other and started talking."

I shot Scarlett a desperate look, silently pleading for backup.

"Come on, Ruby," Scarlett said smoothly. "Look at us-three against one.What could she possibly do? Besides, weren't we supposed to be shopping today?"

Ruby hesitated but finally relented with an eye roll.

I turned back to Anna. "Miss Watson, I think we've said everything that needs saying. From my perspective, we're even. Whatever's going on between you and Victoria has nothing to do with me."

Anna didn't respond, just stared down at her cup. As we walked away,I glanced back. She remained frozen in place, only moving when her phone rang-presumably her mother.

Outside the coffee shop.

"I can't believe you were actually sitting there having coffee with Anna Watson!" Ruby exclaimed as we strolled through the shopping center."After what she did to you? Have you forgotten about the snake?"

"Ruby," I sighed, "sometimes it's better to just... let things go."
"Let things go?" Ruby stopped walking. "Summer, that girl tried to kill you!
"

"She didn't, though," I corrected. "She admitted she arranged to have me locked in the bathroom, but claims she had no idea about the snake."


Both Ruby and Scarlett stared at me in shock.

"Wait, she actually told you that?" Scarlett asked.

I nodded. "Yeah. And honestly? I believe her. She seemed genuinely horrified about the snake part. Plus, I think something happened between her and Victoria."


Ruby snorted. "Of course something happened. You didn't see what went down after Brandon took you to the hospital that night."

My interest piqued immediately. "What do you mean?"

Ruby and Scarlett exchanged a loaded glance.

"We saw Brandon had his people took Anna away through the security camera." Ruby explained. "And Victoria? That bitch didn't lift a finger. Just pretended she didn't even know Anna, watched her get dragged off without saying a word."

I processed this information, my mind fixating on Anna's scars. "Wait, so after I passed out, Anna was... taken somewhere? Those scars on her face-did Brandon have something to do with that?"

Ruby's eyes widened. Her head whipped around quickly. "Wow, this place is packed today, isn't it, Scarlett?"

"Totally!" Scarlett jumped in, too enthusiastically. "Weekend crowds,you
know how it is. Should we check out that new boutique?"

"Guys," I interrupted, "you're not exactly subtle with the topic change."

Both looked sheepish, but neither offered any further information. I sighed,deciding to ask Brandon.

The bedroom was bathed in soft lamplight when I broached the subject with Brandon later that night. He'd just stepped out of the shower,droplets of water still clinging to his hair.

"I ran into Anna Watson today," I said casually, sitting cross-legged on our bed, my nightgown riding up slightly over my thighs.


Brandon paused for just a fraction of a second, his eyes darkening with something I couldn't quite place. "Did you?" he replied,his tone deceptively neutral as he crossed the room toward me, his presence filling the space.

"Mmhmm," I confirmed, fidgeting with the hem of my nightgown. "She has these scars on her face now. Two of them. Ruby mentioned something about her being taken away the night of the snake incident. I just-"

His hand was on me before I could finish, sliding up my thigh with a slow,deliberate pressure that made my breath catch. His fingers brushed the edge of my panties, teasing the sensitive skin there, and I swallowed hard."Brandon," I started, my voice wavering, "I'm trying to talk about something serious here."

"I'm listening," he said, but his hand betrayed his lie. It slipped higher,pushing my nightgown up to my hips, and then his fingers were inside my panties, brushing against the damp heat of my core. My thighs clenched instinctively, and I grabbed his wrist, though my grip was weak.
"Stop it," I protested, but the word came out more like a plea. His thumb found my clit, rubbing slow, torturous circles, and a sharp pulse of pleasure shot through me.

"I forced myself to stay focused. "Brandon, seriously. Did you have something to do with Anna's scars? I know she had me locked in that bathroom, but a woman's face is so important. You didn't-oh fuck!"
###Chapter 119: Soaking Wet

Summer's POV
My question dissolved into a sharp gasp as Brandon’s hands found the small of my back, pulling me flush against the hard planes of his chest. The air in the room felt thick, charged with an unspoken tension that made my skin tingle. His gaze was intense, dark eyes searching mine as if trying to read every secret I was hiding.
"Keep talking," he taunted, his voice a low, gravelly vibration against my skin. "Ask me about Anna."
"I—I can't," I whimpered, my heart hammering a frantic rhythm. He didn't answer with words; instead, he moved with a sudden, predatory grace, pinning me to the bed as the world tilted on its axis. The questions about Anna’s past and her scars were still there, but they were being drowned out by the overwhelming presence of the man above me.
He leaned in, his lips hovering just inches from mine, his breath hot. "You're always so full of questions, June. But right now, I think you need to focus on something else."
The night became a whirlwind of shared heat and desperate longing. Every touch from Brandon was a command, a silent demand for my attention and my heart. We lost ourselves in each other, a storm of emotion and desire that filled the quiet of the bedroom. The boundaries between us blurred as we spoke a silent language that needed no crude descriptions to be understood. It was fierce, unyielding, and completely all-consuming.
As the intensity peaked, I felt a deep, rhythmic pulse of connection that left me breathless. Brandon held me tight, his heart thumping against mine until our breathing finally began to slow.
"Next time you want to talk," he murmured, his voice thick with satisfaction as he kissed my shoulder, "better make it quick."
I swatted at him weakly, too exhausted to argue, and let myself melt into the sheets, utterly spent and thoroughly claimed. After a few minutes, he scooped me up and carried me to the bathroom. The warm water felt like a blessing as he helped me clean up, his touch firm yet surprisingly gentle. By the time he tucked me back under the blankets, sleep had already begun to swallow me whole.
###Chapter 120: Interview

Summer's POV
I woke with a groan, my body feeling the heavy remnants of the previous night’s intensity. Stretching lazily under the covers, I tried to shake off the exhaustion clinging to me.
"Awake?"
Brandon stood in the doorway, already dressed in one of his perfect suits. He looked far too put-together for someone who had gotten as little sleep as I had.
"Eight-thirty? Why didn't you wake me?" I bolted upright, my voice sharper than intended. "Don't you have work today?"
"No rush," he replied, crossing the room and smoothing my tangled hair. "Do you remember what we discussed last night?"
I frowned, trying to recall anything resembling a conversation through the haze of passion. "Last night? You completely distracted me! What did you actually tell me?"
The corner of his mouth twitched. "About going to the company today. For your interview."
"The interview?" I blinked as memories returned. "Are we really doing that today?"
"Yes," he said simply. "Unless you'd rather spend all your time at home."
I chewed my lip. After quitting Fortune Corp, I missed having a purpose. "Fine, I'll give it a try," I conceded. "But one thing—I’m doing this on my own merits. No special treatment, got it?"
Brandon’s smile widened. "Of course. My June is more than capable."
By nine-thirty, we were in Brandon's car heading toward Manhattan. I was nervous, but Brandon’s calm presence helped. He told me the interviewer was Leo Schmidt, the Projects Division Director—a professional man who valued talent over personality.
When we arrived at Stark Tower, we entered through his private garage. "Nobody comes here without permission," he assured me, taking my hand as we headed to the elevator.
On the executive floor, James was waiting. "James, please escort Summer to the Projects Department for her interview," Brandon commanded.
"Don't be nervous, June," Brandon whispered, squeezing my hand before releasing it. "I believe in you."
As James led me through the gleaming corridors, I could hear the hushed whispers of the employees. "Who is she?" "Another parachute executive?" I ignored them, keeping my eyes forward. James led me to a sleek glass-walled office at the end of the hallway and knocked.
"Director Schmidt, I've brought the interview candidate," James announced.
A tall, lean man with piercing blue eyes looked up. "Please come in," he said with a hint of an accent. I straightened my shoulders and stepped forward, determined to prove myself. Whatever happened in this room would be based on my skills, not my husband.
###Chapter 121: Meeting Joe Watson

**Summer's POV**

"Schmidt Director, this is Miss Taylor, here for the interview!" James announced as he ushered me into Leo Schmidt's immaculate office.

I straightened my shoulders and stepped forward with a confident smile. "Hello, Director Schmidt. I'm Summer Taylor."

Leo Schmidt barely looked up from his computer, his piercing blue eyes giving me a quick once-over before shifting his attention to James.

"I'll leave you to it," James said smoothly. "I have matters to attend to upstairs."

As James slipped out, Leo gestured toward the chair across from his desk."Please, sit." Hs voice carried just a hint of an accent-European, maybe German.

I settled into the chair, smoothing my skirt as I watched him retrieve my resume from his drawer. His expression revealed nothing as he flipped through the pages. The silence stretched uncomfortably, but I refused to fidget or break it first. Playing the nervous candidate wouldn't do me any favors.

"Taylor..." he finally said, looking up at me. "Summer Taylor?"

"That's right," I confirmed with a nod.

Leo closed my resume with a deliberate movement. "Your work experience is... ordinary," he stated bluntly. "But I'm interested in the Johnston project you managed at Fortune Corp. Tell me about it in detail."
Over the next forty-five minutes, I walked him through my previous projects, highlighting my decision-making process and problem-solving approaches. Leo asked pointed questions, occasionally nodding when I provided answers that seemed to satisfy him.

"That will be all, Miss Taylor," Leo finally said, closing his notebook. "We'Il let you know our decision."


"Thank you for your time," I replied, rising from my chair. "I appreciate the opportunity."

He nodded, already turning his attention back to his computer.

I had barey stepped into the hallway when my phöne vibrated in my pocket. Brandon's name flashed on the screen. Glancing around to ensure no one was within earshot, I answered.

"Hello?"

"Interview finished?" His deep voice sent an involuntary shiver down my spine.

"Are you spying on me?" I whispered, ducking into an empty corridor.

A low chuckle came through the line. "Come upstairs."

"No way!" I protested. "I'm heading home."

"Be reasonable," he coaxed, his voice softening in that way that always made may resolve weaken. "What are you going to do at home? Come up.I have something good to show you."

I bit my lip, considering his offer, "Fine," I sighed. "But I can't just waltz into your office-people will talk."
"Go to the private elevator in the east wing," he instructed. "It leads to my personal underground garage. Take it up from there."

Fifteen minutes and several wrong turns later, I finally found the correct elevator. After an unnecessarily complicated route that involved doubling back three times, I reached the executive floor. James was waiting for me at the elevator doors, relief washing over his face when he spotted me.


"Mrs. Stark! I was beginning to worry."

"I got lost," I admitted, stepping out of the elevator. "This building is like a maze. And please, James, just call me Summer. We don't need people hearing 'Mrs. Stark' around the office."

"Of course," he agreed quickly, though I could tell the familiar address made him uncomfortable. "Right this way."

James led me to a set of imposing double doors at the end of the hallway.He knocked firmly, waiting for Brandon's muffled "Come in" before gesturing for me to enter.

"Mrs... Miss Taylor is here, sir," he announced formally.

I stepped into Brandon's office for the first time and immediately felt my jaw drop slightly. The space was massive-at least three times the size of the average executive office. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of Manhattan, bathing the room in natural light. The decor was minimalist but undeniably luxurious-sleek furniture, original artwork,and a distinct absence of clutter.

Brandon looked up from his desk and beckoned me over with a slight wave.

"No, you keep working," I said, waving him off. "Ill just look around."
He raised an eyebrow but returned to the document in front of him as I wandered around the perimeter of his office.


When I'd finished my self-guided tour, I settled into one of the comfortable chairs in the sitting area. After a while, my attention drifted back to Brandon.

He was completely absorbed in his work, brow furrowed slightly in concentration. The afternoon sunlight cast a golden glow across his features, highlighting the sharp angle of his jawline and the intensity in his eyes. In the office, he was different-more focused, more commanding.The contrast between this public version of Brandon and the man who held me at night was fascinating.

I found myself staring, unable to look away, until a sharp knock at the door jolted me from my trance. Brandon glanced up, his eyes meeting mine.

"Get the door?" he suggested.

"Is that a good idea?" I hesitated, suddenly conscious of how it might look."What if it's someone from the office?"

Brandon dismissed my concern with a casual wave. "It's fine. Go ahead."

Reluctantly, I crossed the room and opened the door to find a petite woman with glasses and an immaculate blazer. She blinked at me in surprise before her professional mask slid back into place.

"I'm Monica, Mr. Stark's executive assistant," she said, her eyes darting past me to Brandon.

"Please, come in," I stepped aside, feeling awkward in my undefined role.
Monica strode past me with brisk efficiency. "Mr. Stark, Joe Watson has arrived for his appointment."

"Bring him in," Brandon replied without looking up from his papers.

After Monica left, I turned to Brandon with wide eyes. "Joe Watson? As in Anna Watson's brother? Should I...leave?"


"No need," Brandon replied, finally setting down his pen. He extended his hand toward me. "Come here."

I approached cautiously, only for him to capture my hand in his,guiding me to the seating area. I tried to pull away, but his grip was firm.

"What are you doing?" I whispered urgently. "What's going on with Joe Watson? And about the Anna situation-I've already forgiven her. You don't need to-"

Another knock at the door cut me off.

"Come in".

Joe Watson entered with measured confidence, though I noticed his posture was slightly too rigid to be natural. His eyes scanned the room,momentarily passing over us before snapping back in recognition when Brandon stood.

"Mr. Stark," he greeted,his voice carefully controlled.

Brandon nodded at Monica. "Two coffees and a lemon water, please."

As the door closed behind Monica, Brandon gestured toward the chair across from us. "Have a seat,Mr.Watson."

Joe settled into the chair, his expression betraying nothing though I sensed

the calculations happening behind his eyes. He kept glancing at me,clearly trying to place me within the power structure of the room.

"I'd like to introduce you," Brandon said, his voice giving nothing away,"to my wife, Summer Taylor."

The reaction was immediate-Joe's careful composure cracked with genuine surprise, his eyes widening as they darted between us. But his shock was nothing compared to my own. I jerked my head toward Brandon, shooting him a glare that could have melted steel. *Wife?* After all our careful secrecy, he was just announcing it to Joe Watson of all people?

Brandon remained perfectly calm,giving my hand a gentle squeeze as if to say, *Trust me. I know what I'm doing.*

Joe recovered admirably, straightening his tie as understanding visibly dawned on him. "It's a pleasure to meet you,Mrs.Stark."

"Likewise, Mr. Watson," I replied, somehow keeping my voice steady despite the chaos in my head.

What exactly was Brandon playing at?
###Chapter 122: Dilemma

**Joe's POV**

My heart nearly stopped when Brandon Stark casually introduced the woman beside him as his wife. Summer Taylor. The woman Anna had locked in a bathroom with a snake.

I couldn't help but notice how attractive she was -delicate features framed by soft hair, curves in all the right places that even her modest business attire couldn't completely hide. Her figure was impressive, slim waist with generous curves above and below. Great body, beautiful face. Not at all the bitter, plain-looking shrew Anna had described.

I caught Brandon's gaze narrowing slightly as he noticed my assessment of his wife. His dark eyes hardened almost imperceptibly, a silent warning that didn't need translation. I quickly averted my eyes.

The assistant returned with our drinks. She placed a steaming cup of coffee in front of me and a glass of lemon water before Summer.

"Thank you for coming on such short notice," Brandon said, his tone deceptively casual. "I believe we have some unfinished business to discuss."

Brandon released Summer's hand to retrieve something from his desk drawer. He placed a folder on the coffee table between us, sliding it toward me with one finger.

Inside were stock certificates and transaction records-documentation of all the Watson Group shares Brandon had acquired during his campaign against us.

"What am I looking at?" I asked, though I knew damn well what it was.
"The shares of Watson Group," Brandon confirmed, leaning back slightly."Currently held by various Stark Group subsidiaries."

My fingers tightened on the folder. "And you're showing me this because...?”

"Because I'm willing to return them," he stated simply. "And potentially open discussions about partnership opportunities between Stark Group and Watson Group."

The coffee cup nearly slipped from my grasp. A partnership with Stark Group? That would instantly elevate Watson Group's standing on Wall Street.

"That's... a generous offer," I said carefully. "May I ask what prompted this change of heart?"

Brandon's lips curved into that dangerous half-smile that had become legendary in financial circles. "Let's just say I appreciate people who understand the value of mutual benefit."

"And what would you require in return?" I asked, because nothing with Brandon Stark came without strings.

"Nothíng particularly difficult," he replied. "Nothing that requires your personal involvement, in fact."

My stomach tightened. "I'm listening."

"It involves your sister, Anna."

Fuck. I should have known. I leaned forward, speaking quickly. "Mr. Stark,I understand Anna made a terrible mistake. But she's learned her lesson.She even apologized to Summer recently."
Brandon's eyebrow ticked up slightly as he glanced at Summer,who nodded in confirmation.

"You misunderstand me, Mr. Watson," Brandon said. "I'm not looking for further punishment. Quite the opposite."

"I don't follow."

"Your sister and Victoria Taylor-they're close friends, aren't they?"

The question caught me off guard. "Yes, they've been friends for years.
Though after what happened..." I trailed off, uncertain how much to reveal.

"I want Anna to maintain that friendship," Brandon stated.

I blinked, struggling to process his request. "You want... Anna to stay friends with Victoria?"

"Is that a problem?" His tone was light, but his eyes were anything but.

"No, it's just-" I paused, studying him. "May I ask why?"

"Does it matter?" Brandon countered. "It's a simple request."

From the corner of my eye, I noticed Summer shift slightly,her brow furrowing.

"Why would you want Anna to continue being friends with Victoria?"Summer asked, speaking for the first time since introductions."Victoria is-
" She stopped herself, a shadow passing over her face.

Brandon placed his hand over hers, a silent communication passing between them.

I watched this interaction closely, pieces clicking into place. Brandon
wanted Anna to spy on Victoria. But why? What was Victoria to him,besides his nephew's fiancée?

"Do we have an agreement, Mr. Watson?" Brandon's voice cut through my thoughts.

I hesitated, torn between business pragmatism and brotherly concern.Those shares would stabilize Watson Group. A partnership with Stark would secure our future. But using Anna as a pawn-even after what she'd done, it didn't sit right.

"Anna's been through a lot," I said carefully. "Those scars... they've affected her deeply. I'm not sure putting her back in that social circle is healthy."

"I'm not asking her to do anything she wasn't already doing," Brandon pointed out. "Simply maintain a friendship that already exists."

"With someone who abandoned her when she needed help," I countered,remembering how Victoria had watched silently as Anna was dragged away.

"Perhaps that's something Anna should decide for herself," Brandon suggested. "After all, she's an adult, isn't she?"

I took a slow sip of my coffee. Anna would agree in a heartbeat-not just for the company, but because beneath her resentment, she still craved Victoria's approval.

"And if Anna refuses?" I asked, though I already knew she wouldn't.

"Then we remain as we are," Brandon replied with a casual shrug. "No harm done. But no partnership either."
"I should discuss this with Anna first," I said finally.

"Of course," Brandon agreed. "Take your time. We're in no rush." His tone suggested the exact opposite.

He stood. a clear dismissal. "James will show you out. I look forward to hearing good news from you soon. Mr. Watson."

I rose, hesitating before extending my hand. "Thank you for your time,Mr.Stark. Mrs. Stark."

As James appeared to escort me out, I cast one last glance at the power couple. Brandon had already returned to Summer's side, his hand resting possessively on her lower back as he murmured something in her ear.

In that moment, I realized this wasn't just about business or revenge.Brandon Stark was protecting his wife-and God help anyone who stood in his way.

I stepped into the elevator, my decision already crystallizing. The Watson Group had weathered storms before, but never one like Brandon Stark.This partnership wasn't just an opportunity-it was our lifeline. And if all it took was Anna maintaining a friendship she'd been desperate to salvage anyway...

As the elevator doors closed, I pulled out my phone and scrolled to Anna's number. She wouldn't like being used as a pawn, but she'd like bankruptcy even less. Besides, she'd been obsessed with Victoria Taylor for years-this arrangement might actually give her what she wanted, even if it came with strings attached.

My thumb hoveed over the call button for just a moment before I pressed it. Some choices weren't really choices at all.
"Anna." I said when the call was connected.
###Chapter 123: Wedding Preparations

**Victoria's POV**

The Ritz-Carlton suite's panoramic windows framed Manhattan like it wras my personal backdrop. I admired my reflection as the stylist made final adjustments to my custom Vera Wang gown. Ivory silk cascaded from my waist,bodice adorned with hand-sewn crystals that caught every hint of light.

"Miss Taylor, please hold still," the stylist murmured,adjusting the train.

I sucked in my breath, annoyed but compliant. My gaze drifted to the window. watching the steady stream of black town cars depositing Manhattan's elite at our doorstep. Years of hustle, sacrifice, and yes, a few well-placed manipulations had led to this moment. Alexander Stark was about to become my husband, and everyone who mattered had shown up to witness it.

A knock interrupted my thoughts.

"Victoria? Darling, it's me."

Mom swept in, resplendent in champagne-colored Chanel that probably cost more than most people's monthly rent. Her face lit up when she saw me,genuine pride shining in her eyes-the look I'd spent my entire life trying to earn.

"Oh, Victoria," she breathed. "You look absolutely stunning."

"Mom, is everyone here yet?"

"Almost everyone," she replied. "But honey, you wouldn't believe it-literally every A-lister in Manhattan showed up! Victoria, sweetheart, I'm
making sure the entire Upper East Side knows my daughter is the luckiest bride in New York City."

Warmth spread through my chest. After years fighting for her approval, I finally had it-completely.

"Mom! Where's Alex?" I asked, suddenly realizing I hadn't seen my fiancéin hours.

"He's working the room, darling. The guest list is insane." She winked."Don't worry,you two will have plenty of alone time later."

Heat rushed to my cheeks. "Mom! Seriously?"

Elizabeth laughed. "Come now, you're about to be a married woman. No need for false modesty. And speaking of being married-you should follow my advice and give Alexander a child as soon as possible. That will secure your position in the Stark family even more firmly."

My smile faltered. "A baby? But I'm still young, and I just signed with Stark Entertainment. Having a child might ruin my figure." I redirected quickly. "Anyway, Mom, has that little nuisance Summer shown up yet?"

Elizabeth's expression soured slightly. "Didn't you say you gave her an invitation? She can't possibly stay away."

My eyes brightened. "That's good. She is my only sister, after all. I'd be so disappointed if she missed my wedding." Inside, I was relishing a different sentiment: *Whether she comes or not, this wedding will be a permanent scar on her heart.*

"Soon I'm going to find your sister a good man, whether she wants it or not. Well, I can't stay too long-I should go back to greeting our guests."Mom smoothed her dress. "By the way, where are those friends of yours?
Sophie and Anna, right? I haven't seen them."

"Sophie's already here, Mom. It's my wedding-how could she miss it? As for Anna, she's not-"

A knock on the door interrupted me. I went to answer it, expecting another stylist. Instead, I found myself staring at a ghost.

Anna Watson stood in the doorway, her face marred by two angry red scars. I stumbled backward in shock, my hand flying to my mouth.

"You..." I couldn't speak, terror gripping my chest as memories of Manhattan Club and Brandon Stark's wrathflashed through my mind.

Anna's lips curved into a hollow smile. "Victoria, congratulations to you and Alexander!"

I forced myself to regain composure. "Anna, thank you, I didn't expect you today. I heard about your... is your face okay? I'm sorry, I was just...surprised. Who did this to you?"

Anna's expression hardened. "Who else but that bitch Summer? I'll never forgive her for this."

My mother approached, taking Anna's hand sympathetically. "Such a beautiful face, what a shame. Anna, you were so gorgeous before.What a pity!"

"Mrs. Taylor! Does it look terrible?" Anna's voice trembled.

"No, no, not terrible. Anna is still beautiful!" Mom reassured her. "Some people might be pretty on the outside but have rotten hearts. I just think it's unfortunate-why haven't you gotten proper treatment?"
"I will," Anna assured her. "But Victoria's wedding is mnore important. If I had gone for reconstructive surgery, I might not have seen Victoria for six months, and I couldn't miss giving her my congratulations in person.Victoria is my best friend. Victoria, I wish you and Alexander eternal happiness and a blessed future together."

Guilt twisted inside me. "Thank you! Anna, I'm so sorry about what happened. Summer is my sister, bu I never imagined she'd do something like this to you. I don't expect you to forgive her, but today is my wedding-if Summer does show up, please don't cause a scene,alright?"

"Okay." Anna said. "I promise I won't confront Summer today. I'll be fine."

Mom patted Anna's shoulder. "I need to go attend to the guests."

After Mom left, I retreated to my vanity to touch up my makeup, using the mirror to observe Anna's reflection. She stood behind me, her eyes tracking my every movement. I could feel her gaze burning into me. and despite our years of friendship,something felt different now-dangerous.

Anna approached, admiration painted across her scarred face. "Victoria,you look drop-dead gorgeous. I heard you're jumping straight into that big movie after the honeymoon. So jealous! I'm heading out of town for a bit after today, but when I'm back, I'll be first in line to see your film."

I paused midway through applying my lipstick. "Thanks, appreciate it!"

"Oh! Almost forgot your gift!" Anna pulled out an exquisite box from her designer bag.

I opened it to reveal a stunning natural crystal necklace. "Holy shit, Anna.This is way too much."

"It's nothing. Put it on-just a little something for your big day."
"Thanks. I love it!" I fastened it around my neck.

As I adjusted the crystal, I caught a glimpse of Anna's expression in the mirror. For just a moment, her eyes went cold, something dark flickering behind them. Yet her smile remained fixed in place. perfectly pleasant.
###Chapter 124: All Eyes on Brandon

**Summer's POV**

I smoothed down the silky fabric of my dress, turning to catch my reflection from different angles. The white cocktail dress was perfectly tailored-not flashy, but elegant enough for Victoria's wedding. I'd deliberately chosen something understated, a dress that would help me blend into the background.

That was the goal. Get in, make an appearance, then get out. No drama.

With a final twist, I secured my pearl earring and assessed the full effect.My makeup was minimal, hair pulled into a simple updo with a few loose strands framing my face.

The prickling sensation of being watched made me turn. Brandon leaned against the doorframe, a silk tie dangling from his fingers, his dark eyes fixed on me with an intensity that made my pulse quicken. He was already dressed in a perfectly tailored charcoal suit, but his gaze wasn't casual-it was pure, undisguised hunger.

"What?" I asked nervously. "Is something wrong?"

Brandon remained silent, his chest rising and falling with deliberate breaths.

"Brandon? Say something!"

"You look gorgeous," he finally replied, his voice dropoping to that low register that always sent shivers down my spine.

I exhaled with relief. "God, you scared me! The way you were staring.I thought I had lipstick on my teeth."
"There is a problem," Brandon countered, stepping closer.

"What?" My hands flew to my hair.

"You," he said simply. "You're the problem." His fingertips traced my bare shoulder. "You're too beautiful. So beautiful that I want to keep you all to myself, tuced away where no one else can see you. I want to carry you in my pocket everywhere I go. No other man should look at you."

I realized I'd been standing frozen, and Brandon's expression shifted to concern.

"Does that bother you?" he asked. "When I say things like that... do you think I'm being too controlling?"

I couldn't help but smile. "Are you kidding? That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me." I reached up to cup his face. "And no, I don't think you're being controlling. Well, you are-but only with me. And honestly? Every woman dreams of having her husband say things like that." I leaned in. "Besides, women have a thing for powerful, possessive men.And you, Mr. Stark, are definitely the ultimate version of that fantasy."

His smile widened as he pulled me against him. "I'm, but only for June,"he murmured. "Only for you."

I melted into him before reluctantly pulling back. "We should get going."

"About that," I began carefully, watching his reflection as he returned to his tie. "I think we should arrive separately."

His hands stilled, eyes meeting mine in the mirror.

"I know that's not what you want to hear," I hurried on, "but hardly anyone knows we're married. If we show up together at Victoria's wedding,
people will definitely start asking questions."

Brandon's jaw tightened.

"I know," I said, stepping up to help with his tie. "But I promise, we'll just make a brief appearance, then we can leave early. And afterward,how about we go catch a movie?"

His expression softened slightly. "You're really pushing for this separate arrival thing."

"It's not that I'm ashamed of us," I explained. "It's just that we're not ready for the drama. Victoria would make a scene, and your family doesn't even know yet." I finished adjusting his tie. "I'm trying to spare us both unnecessary headaches."

"Alright." Brandon conceded. "But I won't pretend I like it."

"I know you don't. But Victoria is still my sister, and if I don't show up,she'll use it against me somehow." I squeezed his hands. "Don't worry,she can't hurt me anymore. I have you."

Brandon nodded, pressing a gentle kiss to my forehead. "Go ahead then.I'Il follow shortly."

I pulled the red Porsche into the Ritz-Carlton's parking area. Brandon had insisted I take it-"If we're arriving separately, at least arrivein style," he'd said.

The white dress against the red leather created a statement that felt decidedly un-Summer-like. But maybe that was the point. I wasn't the same old Summer anymore.

The grand ballroom was already packed. I scanned the crowd,
a8
immediately sensing Alexander's gaze fixed on me with an intensity that made me uncomfortable. Even from a distance, I could read the naked longing on his face.

I slipped through the crowd and finally spotted Ruby and Scarlett in a corner, sampling hors d'oeuvres.

"There you are!" Ruby exclaimed. "I was beginning to think you'd bailed."

Scarlett eyed my dress approvingly. "You look amazing.Perfectly understated. Makes Victoria look even more over-the-top by comparison."

"So," Ruby glanced around, "where's the husband? Don't tell me you left him at home."

"He'll be here," I assured her. "We just thought it would be better to arrive separately."

Ruby rolled her eyes. "God forbid the great Brandon Stark cause a scene."

"Please keep your voices down," I hissed. "And remember, you promised-not a word about us."

"Our lips are sealed," Scarlett promised. "Though I still think you're missing a golden opportunity to see Victoria's face when she realizes you've married someone a thousand times more impressive than Alexander."

"Maybe someday," I said. "But today is not that-"

"Oh my god, he's here!" Ruby suddenly whispered, her eyes fixed over my shoulder. "Look at everyone's reaction!"

I turned and immediately understood. Brandon had arrived, and as always,his presence transformed the entire room. Conversations halted as people
nudged each other and whispered.

Alexander's father immediately rushed forward, his face split in an ingratiating smile. Richard Taylor followed close behind.

"Brandon, my dear nephew!" Old Alexander called out loudly. "How wonderful of you to join us on this joyous occasion!"

Brandon's expression remained coolly polite, though I detected disgust in his eyes. Without a word, he signaled to James, who stepped forward with a crisp red envelope.

"Mr. Taylor," Brandon said, addressing Richard directly and completely ignoring old Alexander's attempt at familiarity. "Congratulations on your daughter's wedding: Please accept this small token of my regard."

Richard looked momentarily stunned. "Mr. Stark, this is... most generous.We're honored by your presence."

Old Alexander looked crestfallen at being dismissed, but quickly tried to recover. "Brandon, you must meet the rest of the family!"

Brandon's voice took on an edge of boredom. "Actually, I'm looking for Mr.
George Taylor. We have a standing chess engagement, and he promised me a rematch today."

A collective "Ah!" of understanding rippled through the guests. So Brandon Stark wasn't here for Alexander or Victoria at all-he was here because of George Taylor, my grandfather.

As Brandon moved through the crowd, I caught his eye briefly. The corner of his mouth twitched in that secret smile meant only for me, and I felt warmth spread through my chest.
Tonight would be interesting, to say the least.
###Chapter 125: Let Her Go

**Brandon's POV**

"Father is resting in a private suite," Richard said. "Would you like me to show you the way?"

The hotel staff member who guided me to the suite practically vibrated with nervous energy. Inside, I found exactly what I'd expected-George Taylor and Jonathan Thompson, hunched over a chess board, completely absorbed in their game.

"Checkmate in three moves," Jonathan was saying, his weathered face creased in concentration.

George scoffed. "Two, if you'd been paying attention to my knight."

I slipped off my jacket. "Make that four moves, Professor. Your bishop is vulnerable."

Both men looked up, identical expressions of delight spreading across their faces.

"Brandon!" they exclaimed in unison.

I approached, clasping each man's hand firmly. ""Mr. Taylor, Professor Thompson. I see you're enjoying a game."

George gestured to an empty chair. "Join us, son. You're just in time to settle an argument about this bishop's fate."

I settled into the chair. "You arrived early."

"Not particularly," George replied, his eyes twinkling. "Originally planned
to skip this circus altogether, but I was worried about my Summer showing up. Couldn't leave my granddaughter toface those vultures alone.
" He glanced around. "Speaking of which, where is that girl?"

"Mingling." I replied. "We arrived separately."

Jonathan's expression darkened immediately. "Still playing that game, are you? When exactly are you two planning to stop this charade?"

I maintained my composure, nodding slightly. "You're absolutely right,Professor. This situation is far from ideal, and I take full responsibility for the secrecy."

"Damn right you should," Jonathan huffed. "You're a grown man, Brandon.If you didn't approve of this arrangement, Summer couldn't insist on it."

"Summer is concerned about potential complications once our marriage becomes public knowledge," I explained calmly. "She needs time to adjust.
You know I don't personally care about public opinion, or I wouldn't have married her in the first place."

Jonathan's eyes narrowed. "And if that stubborn granddaughter of mine decides to drag this out indefinitely? Your position isn't going to change,Brandon."

I leaned forward, my voice low but firm. "Professor, trust me on this. Not much longer. I never fight battles I'm not certain I'll win."

Jonathan studied me before sighing. "Call her in here. I haven't seen my granddaughter in weeks."

I reached for my phone, dialing June's number.

"Hello?" Her voice came through, slightly muffled.
"Where are you?" I asked.

"Bathroom area," she replied. "Something wrong?"

"I'm with Grandpa and Professor. They want to see you." I paused,noticing tension in her voice. "Is someone with you?"

Her response was careful, measured. "Yeah, my brother-in-law."

Alexander. Something cold settled in my gut. "Stay there. I'm coming to you now."

I ended the call before she could protest, already rising from my chair.

"Problem?" George asked, his shrewd eyes missing nothing.

"Minor issue," I replied smoothly. "I'll bring Summer back shortly."


Summer's POV

I stared at my phone in disbelief as Brandon hung up. Perfect timing. Just...perfect.

"Who was that?" Alexander demanded, stepping closer.

"None of your business," I replied, slipping my phone back into my clutch.

The hallway outside the restrooms was mercifully empty, but that isolation now felt like a trap. Alexander stood between me and the main ballroom,his body language aggressive in a way that made my skin crawl.

"Everything about you is my business, Summer," he insisted, his voice dropping to what he probably thought was seductive. "We both know this wedding is just a formality. Victoria has her ambitions, I have mine,but what we had...that was real."
I could barely stop myself from rolling my eyes. "Are you seriously hitting on me at your own wedding? God, Alexander, you're even more pathetic than I thought."

His expression hardened. "You don't mean that. I know you,Summer.Better than anyone. Those three years we spent together-"

"Those three years where you were secretly fucking my sister behind my back?" I cut in, my voice razor-sharp. "Those three years where I was just your backup plan while you worked out how to get Victoria's shares?Those three years?"

He flinched, then reached for my hand. I jerked away, but he was faster,his fingers wrapping around my wrist with surprising strength.

"Let go of me," I hissed.

"Not until you listen," he insisted. "I made a mistake, okay? I thought Victoria was what I wanted, but I was wrong. You're the one I can't stop thinking about."

"Alexander, even if that were true-which I doubt-it doesn't matter. I don't want you. I don't love you."

"You're lying," he said, tightening his grip until it hurt. "You wouldn't be here if you didn't still care."

"I'm here because Victoria is my sister," I said slowly, as if explaining to a child. "That's literally the only reason. Now let. Go. Of. My. Hand."

Instead, he pulled me closer. "Tell me you don't still feel something."

I tried to twist free, wincing as his fingers dug into my skin. "You have no idea what type I am anymore. People change, Alexander.I've changed."
"You're mine, Summer," he growled, suddenly yanking me closer, his free hand gripping my waist. "You've always been mine. If you think I'm going to let some other man have you-"

"What are you doing exactly? Let her go."

The voice was soft, dangerously soft, but it cut through the air like a blade.Alexander froze, his grip slackening enough for me to wrench my hand free and step away.

Brandon stood at the end of the hallway, his expression perfectly composed but his eyes blazing with cold fury. He wore that deceptively casual stance I'd come to recognize-relaxed shoulders, hands in pockets-the calm before the storm.

"Mr. Stark," I said, desperately trying to sound normal as I rubbed my aching wrist. "I didn't expect to see you here."

Brandon's eyes tracked the movement, noting the red marks Alexander had left on my skin. Something dark flashed across his face before he controlled it.

"Miss Taylor," he acknowledged, his voice perfectly polite but with an undercurrent that made my heart race.

Alexander seemed to shrink before my eyes, the arrogant man who'd just been manhandling me suddenly transformed into an awkward,stammering mess.

"Uncle Brandon?" he choked out. "Why are you here?"
###Chapter 126: Elizabeth's Plan

**Victoria's POV**

Just now, I rushed through the Ritz-Carlton hallway, my wedding dress rustling with each quick step. Turning the corner, I froze and saw there they were-Alexander and Summer-standing way too close together outside the restrooms. My fiancé-no, my *husband* in just a few hours was practically cornering my sister against the wall, his hand gripping her wrist. And now there was another man. A tall figure in an impeccable suit approached Alexander and Summer. My breath caught. Brandon Stark.

My blood boiled. I started forward, ready to figure out what the fuck was going on, when Anna grabbed my arm, yanking me back behind a pillar.

"What the hell?" I hissed, trying to shake her off.

"Just watch what they are going to say." Anna suggested.

Brandon ignored Alex completely and turned to Summer. "I was just speaking with George Taylor. He mentioned you."

"Mr. Stark is friends with my grandfather?" Summer sounded surprised but pleased. "He actually just called me, asking me to join him."

"Perhaps we could head there together?" Brandon suggested smoothly.

"I'd like that," Summer replied with a smile that seemed far too friendly.

Alexander stepped forward desperately. "Summer! You promised we'd talk.

11
She frowned, looking genuinely annoyed. I couldn't believe it-even with Brandon Stark right there, Alexander was still chasing after Summer.
"Correct me if I'm wrong," Brandon said, his voice dropping to a dangerous pitch, "but this is your wedding day with the Taylor family's eldest daughter. Running around bathroom hallways to corner your former fiancée seems... interesting."

Alexander paled visibly. "I-I just-"

"Your absence from the ballroom might be noticed," Brandon continued."Miss Taylor, shall we proceed to see your grandfather?"

"Sure." Summer replied quickly.

Alexander tried again pathetically, "Uncle Brandon,you-"

"It's your wedding day," Brandon cut him off coldly. "Act like it. Your father invited me to witness a celebration, not a spéctacle."

Alexander retreated like a scolded puppy.

I was pissed off, ready to confront Alexander before he got away when Anna stopped me again. I yanked my arm away from Anna, spinning to face her. "What the fuck are you doing?" I snarled under my breath. "I'm going to..."

Anna said, "And do what exactly?"

"What do you mean 'do what'? That's my fiancé-my almost-husband-and my sister!"

"It's your wedding day," Anna reminded me. "If you go over there making a scene, you'll be the laughingstock of New York society. You will marry Alexander soon-how will it Jook if you start a fight now? The Stark family will be humiliated."
I stared at her, taken aback. This calculating approach wasn't the Anna I knew. "Since when did you get so... strategic?"

"What, you think I've gotten smarter?" Anna asked, her scarred face unreadable.

"No! That's not what I meant," I backtracked quickly. "Don't misunderstand."

"It's fine, we're friends," Anna said with a tight smile. "I admit I wasn't thinking clearly before. But after what that snake Summer did to me,how could I not wise up? That woman is evil."

Anna glanced down the hallway where Brandon and Summer had disappeared. "We'll deal with her later. Right now, your priority is locking down Alexander. Once you're officially married, why worry about Summer?



"You're right," I admitted, my thoughts clearing. "I lost my head for a minute. Come on, let's go."

\---

"Mom!" I called the moment I reached my bridal suite. "Come here,quick!"

Elizabeth swept in, looking irrtated. "What now? I'm running around like crazy out there, and your father's asking for me. If it's not urgent, can't it wait?"

"Mom, I can't wait any longer. Until Summer's married off, I'll never have peace.You promised you'd help me!"

"Why the rush?" Elizabeth asked, studying my face. "Did something happen?"
"I..." I hesitated, not sure how to explain what I'd just witnessed.

Elizabeth's face darkened. "It's that little bitch again, isn't it?"

"Exactly," I nodded eagerly. "Mom, I can't stand it anymore. Alexander just can't for get about Summer! I'm sure if she would take him back, he'd cancel our wedding and marry her instead! We really need to get Summer out of our hair and make Alexander completely mine!"

"Calm down. I've gotten everything ready." Mom said with a calculating smile.

She pulled out her phone and dialed. "Hello, Daisy? Has your son arrived yet?"

"Yes, he's here!" a woman's voice replied. "This is perfect! I always said those two would be a match. Thank goodness we arranged this when they were just babies. Yes, I'll wait for him."

Mom hung up with a smug smile. "There's my solution."


"What does that mean?" I asked.

"It's perfect," Mom explained, eyes gleaming with malice. "Ive arranged a suitable marriage for dear Summer. She doesn't deserve such a good match,but it benefits the Taylor family to connect with the Sullivans."

A slow smile spread across my face as understanding dawned. "Mom, that s brilliant! You're my rock,seriously."

"Let's go," she said, smoothing her dress. "Your father's probably foaming at the mouth by now."

We found Dad pacing near the entrance to the ballroom, looking annoyed.
"Where the hell have you been?" he demanded. "I've been looking everywhere!"

"Checking on Victoria, of course," Mom replied coolly. "It's her wedding day-a mother has duties. I heard Old Alexander was unhappy with you.What happened?"

Dad leaned in, lowering his voice. "You'll never guess who showed up-Brandon Stark!"

"Brandon Stark?" Mom's eyes widened.

Mom's eyes took on that calculating look I knew so well. "If only Victoria had set her sights on Brandon instead of Alexander..." 。

"What about Summer?" Dad suggested, his voice dropping even lower."She's still single."

"Absolutely not," I cut in sharply.

Mom shook her head firmly. "Out of the question."

"What?" Dad looked genuinely confused. "Why not? Brandon Stark is Wall Street royalty. Having him as part of the family would be a dream come true."

"Summer?" I laughed incredulously. "Dad, are you serious? She's nowhere near Brandon Stark's league. She'd embarrass us all."

"Besides," Mom added, "I've aIready made arrangements for Summer."

"What arrangements?" Dad asked.

"Remember that woman I saved years ago? Daisy Sullivan? She's Sullivan family-another of the Wall Street dynasties. When I saved her life,she
promised me a favor."

"Wait," Dad's eyes widened. "You're saying-"

"Summer will marry her son," Mom confirmned."Ijust got off the phone with Daisy. Her son is coming today specifically to meet Summer."

"Sullivan?" Dad looked thoughtful. "I didn't know Daisy had a son."

"Few people do. He keeps an extremely low profile. The arrangement is perfect, though-Sullivan family connections would be invaluable to us."
"That's... actually brilliant," Dad admitted, a greedy gleam in his eyes.

"Of course it is," Mom smiled coldly. "Summer gets a husband far above her station,and we get the Sullivan connection. I just spoke with Daisy-it's all arranged. He's already here."

I felt a surge of satisfaction. Soon, Summer would be married off and shipped away,leaving Alexander fully committed to me. Even better, she'd be stuck with some mystery Sullivan nobody who'd probably keep her locked up in some mansion far away from New York.

"Just wait till Summer finds out," I whispered, unable to keep the glee from my voice. "She won't know what hit her."
###Chapter 127: Sister Rivalry

**Summer's POV**

The Ritz-Carlton's grand ballroom glittered with New York's elite as our small group emerged from the private suite. I carefully supported Grandpa George's arm while Brandon walked alongside Professor Jonathan,their heads bent in quiet conversation.

A hush fell over the crowd as we entered.

I guided Grandpa George to a quieter corner of the ballroom where we could have some peace. Brandon and Professor Jonathan followed, taking seats at our table. As always, Brandon's presence commanded attention-his aura of power impossible to ignore. With him at our table, we inevitably became the focus of curious glances and whispered speculation.

"Who's that young woman with George Taylor?"

"Why is Brandon Stark sitting with them?"

I caught snippets of conversation from nearby tables, pretending not to hear, though internally I was torn between amusement and irritation.

"Ignore them," Grandpa George muttered, patting my hand. "Vultures,the lot of them."

Across the room, Victoria and Alexander entered, champagne flutes clutched in their hands, faces tightening as they absorbed the scene.Victoria's eyes narrowed as she took in our table arrangement, while Alexander's gaze bounced between Brandon and me.

Victoria painted on her most radiant smile and glided over,pulling Alexander along like an accessory.
"Grandpa! Professor! You made it!" she exclaimed with performative sweetness. Then, turning to me: "Summer! I'm so happy that you came!"

Grandpa George and Professor Jonathan merely nodded, their lukewarm response speaking volumes.

Victoria's attention immediately shifted to Brandon. "Mr. Stark! What an honor to have you at our wedding!"

I tensed involuntarily at her familiarity, my gaze darting between her and Brandon. Victoria continued chattering excitedly, but Brandon maintained a polite but distant expression. He didn't even acknowledge her-not a word, not even a glance. The complete dismissal was so obvious that Victoria's smile began to strain at the edges.

Alexander stepped forward, reaching for a nearby bottle of champagne. He poured a glass and offered it to Brandon with a forced smile.

"Uncle Brandon, I'm so glad you could make it to our wedding," he said.his voice carrying just a hint of desperation.

Brandon's lips curled. He finally looked up, meeting Alexander's eyes with cool detachment.

"Congratulations on your marriage," he replied, his tone clipped. Then,glancing at the offered drink: "I'll need to drive later, so I'll pass on the alcohol. James!"

James materialized instantly at Brandon's side."Mr.Stark?"

With nothing more than a subtle nod from Brandon, James reached into his briefcase and produced an elegant envelope. "Mr. Brandon Stark's wedding gift for Mr. Alexander Stark and Miss Taylor," he announced formally.
-
Alexander took the envelope. "Thank you, Uncle Brandon. That's very generous."

Brandon acknowledged this with the barest tilt of his head.

The dismissal was unmistakable. Alexander's jaw tightened, his eyes flickering to me with barely concealed frustration. I deliberately kept my gaze averted.

As they turned to leave, Victoria paused beside me.

"Summer, it's my wedding day. Have a drink with your sister?" Her voice was honey-sweet,but I could hear the challenge underneath.

I looked up, momentarily surprised, then smniled. "Of course."

I poured a cup of tea and offered it to her. "I've been feeling under the weather lately, so I can't join you in champagne. But they say sisters should share both joy and hardship, so let's share tea instead." I raised my own cup. "To your marriage!"

Victoria's eyes narrowed slightly as though searching for hidden meaning in my words.

"Aren't you going to drink?" I prompted,raising an eyebrow.

Victoria tipped back the tea in one swift motion. "Thank you, little sister.Don't worry-you've given me your most precious treasure, and I promise to take good care of it. No one will ever take it from me."

I felt my expression freeze as her meaning sank in. Brandon tensed beside me, a chill emanating from him,that even nearby guests seemed to sense.

After a moment of shock, I laughed softly. "Well, make sure you hold onto
it tightly-don't let go!" I sat back down and turned to Grandpa George,effectively ending the conversation. His face was flushed with anger, so I gently patted his hand. "Would you like some tea, Grandpa?"

Grandpa George seemed to come back to himself, noting my smile with evident relief before nodding.

He turned to Victoria. "Victoria, why don't you and Alexander see to your other guests?"

Once Victoria and Alexander had reluctantly moved on, Grandpa George sighed heavily. "I'm sorry you had to endure that."

I shook my head, smiling. "What's there to be sorry about? All my treasures are right here at this table."

Grandpa George and Professor Jonathan exchanged knowing looks, then turned to Brandon.

"Did you hear that, Brandon?" Grandpa George said with a hint of mischief. "Apparently we're all Summer's treasures at this table."

"Yeah." Brandon replied, his voice tinged with amusement. His eyes found mine, and for a moment, it felt like everyone else in the room disappeared.

I glanced across the ballroom and spotted Ruby and Scarlett seated with our Columbia classmates. They appeared to be fielding questions from our curious former classmates. Ruby caught my eye and gave me a subtle thumbs-up, which made me smile despite the tension.

I noticed Victoria and Alexander greeting various guests. Victoria seemed to have had quite a few glasses of champagne, her movements increasingly unsteady. I watched as she leaned heavily against Alexander, her body pressed against his side in a way that seemed deliberately provocative.
-
Even from a distance, I could see Alexander's discomfort as she whispered something in his ear.

After a moment. Alexander took Victoria's arm and began guiding her toward the exit. They stopped briefly to speak with my parents. I couldn't hear what they were saying, but Victoria seemed to be whispering something to my mother that made Elizabeth nod with determination.Then Alexander led Victoria away,presumably to one of the private rooms.

Elizabeth watched them go, then straightened her designer dress and headed purposefully toward our table.

She approached with practiced elegance, greeting each person. "Father,Mr.Stark." Her eyes lingered on Brandon and me, calculating something behind her polite smile. "Summer?"

I rose to my feet without saying a word.

Elizabeth clearly felt constrained by the presence of Grandpa George and Professor Jonathan, but I could see the wheels turning behind her eyes as she glanced between Brandon and me.

She leaned closer. "Summer, dear, I need to discuss something with you.Would you come with me for a moment?"











	
###Chapter 128: Summer's Blind Date

**Summer's POV**

I met Elizabeth's gaze evenly, trying to decipher what scheme was brewing behind those calculating eyes. With Victoria off somewhere with Alexander,and Elizabeth suddenly seeking me out, my internal alarm bells were ringing at full volume.

"Summer, darling, won't you even speak with your mother?" Elizabeth pressed,glancing nervously at Grandpa George and Professor Jonathan. "Have I become such a stranger that you won't spare me a few minutes?"

I remained silent, my face carefully neutral. *Nice performance, Mother.Oscar-worthy,really.*

"Summer," she continued, laying it on thicker, "I have something to give you. Now that Victoria's married, my biggest concern is you. I haven't had a chance to talk with you properly in so long-you're always busy, never at home!"

Grandpa Jonathan suddenly set down his teacup with enough force to make everyone flinch.

"Enough!" he snapped, glaring at Elizabeth. "You've been a poor excuse for a mother for years, and now you have the audacity to blame Summer for not being around? If she can't stand to be in that house, whose fault do you think that is?"

Elizabeth's perfectly composed facade cracked. "Father! I-" She turned desperately. "George, you know how I've treated Summer. You've seen it with your own eyes. Tell them!"
Grandpa George's weathered face hardened. "It's your daughter's wedding day.Why aren't you busy attending to Victoria and the guests? Why are you so fixated on speaking with Summer right now?"
Elizabeth's phone suddenly rang. She glanced at it, and a flash of triumph crossed her face as she stepped aside and answered it.

I felt my phone vibrate in my clutch. Discreetly checking it, I saw a message from Brandon: *"Go with her. I've got it handled. You'll be fine."*
I looked up, meeting Brandon's gaze. Something in his eyes reassured me.

"Alright, " I said, rising from my seat. "I'll come with you."

"Grandpa George, Grandpa Jonathan," I added, turning to them, "Ill be right back. Mr. Stark, it was a pleasure."

Brandon nodded, a hint of amusement in his voice. "Likewise, Miss Taylor.



As Elizabeth took my arm, I caught the flash of cold fury in Brandon's eyes when her fingers closed around my wrist.

The moment we were in the hallway, away from prying eyes, Elizabeth dropped my arm like it was contaminated and her saccharine smile vanished.

"What was that little performance?" she demanded, her voice sharp. "I ask you to come speak with me, and you sit there giving me the silent treatment? I'm your mother! Do you think I'd hurt my own daughter?"

"What did you want to discuss that was so urgent it couldn't wait,Mother?
Elizabeth's nostrils flared. "That attitude! After everything I've done for you-"
"What exactly have you done for me?" I interrupted, my patience wearing thin.

She waved away my question. "Your sister and I have been so worried about you. Now that Victoria is married, my biggest concern is your future.It's time we settled your marriage situation."

*There it is.* I barely managed not to roll my eyes. Of course this was about marrying me off.
"I appreciate your concern," I said coolly, "but I'm still young.My marriage is not something you need to worry about."
Elizabeth's eyes narrowed dangerously. "What exactly are you saying?After all the trouble I've gone through to arrange this? You know, the man I'm introducing you to is the son of my dear friend from years ago. He's from the Sullivan family-they have serious standing on Wall Street-"

"Mother," I cut in firmly, "I'm not interested in meeting anyone for marriage purposes right now."

Her hand flew up so suddenly I barely had time to react, stepping backward to avoid the slap. "You ungrateful little brat! Are you trying to kill me with this behavior?"

"I don't intend to upset you," I said, standing my ground. "But I won't be meeting this man with marriage in mind. That's final."

Elizabeth's face contorted with rage. "You dare! Do you have any idea who the Sullivans are?"
"Then let those girls marry him," I replied evenly. "Because I absolutely won't. Not now, not ever."

Just as Elizabeth looked ready to explode, a smooth male voice interrupted our standoff.

"Mrs. Taylor?"

Elizabeth's anger vanished instantly, replaced by a practiced smile as she turned toward the voice. But not before hissing at me: "Watch your mouth!


"Are you Michael Sullivan, Daisy's son?" she asked, her voice suddenly honey-sweet again.

I turned to see who had arrived, and nearly choked.

The man standing in the hallway was impeccably dressed in a designer suit. His dark hair was styled with just the right amount of carelessness,and his sharp features were arranged in a politely distant smile.

"Hello, I'm Michael Sullivan," he said smoothly, his smile not quite reaching his eyes. "And you must be Elizabeth Taylor, the woman my mother speaks so highly of?"

Elizabeth practically preened. "Yes, yes, that's me! It's wonderful to finally meet you."

I could see the calculations running behind her eyes-probably regretting offering him damaged goods like me instead of Victoria.

"This is my younger daughter, Summer," Elizabeth continued, nudging me forward. "Summer, this is Mr. Michael Sullivan, Daisy's son I've mentioned before. Say hello to Mr.Sullivan!"
I extended my hand woodenly. "Hello, Mr. Sullivan."

"Miss Taylor," he replied, taking my hand. "Ive heard so much about you."

I could see the laughter dancing in his eyes, and it took everything I had not to break character.

Elizabeth ushered us into a nearby sitting room, making a show of hospitality.

"Tll leave you two to get acquainted," she said, though her eyes delivered a clear warning to me: *Behave yourself.* She glanced back one more time before closing the door behind her.

The moment we were alone, I turned on the man.

He was unmistakably Dr. Sean Sullivan-Brandon's friend!

"Michael Sullivan?" I asked, raising an eyebrow. "When exactly did you become Michael Sullivan?"

Sean's polished facade instantly melted away as he flopped onto the nearest chair with a grin. "Oh man, Summer! Can you imagine Brandon's face if he knew your mother was trying to set you1 up with me? He'd probably have an aneurysm!"

"It's not with you," I corrected, "it's with Michael Sullivan. And for your information, Brandon knows exactly where I am."

Sean laughed, shaking his head. "Your mom is something else, trying to arrange your marriage at your sister's wedding. That's next-level crazy,even by Upper East Side standards."

"So," I asked, "who the fuck is this Michael Sullivan?"
###Chapter 129: What Happened in the Lounge

**Summer's POV**

I stared at Sean in disbelief, trying to process this bizarre situation. The infamous Dr. Sean Sullivan-Brandon's friend, one of the Wall Street Four-was supposedly the "Michael Sullivan" my mother had been scheming to set me up with?

Sean gestured for me to sit down, his expression softening slightly. "Here,take a seat. Let me get you some water." He poured a glass of ice water from the crystal carafe on the side table and handed it to me.

"Thanks." I sat down, taking a grateful sip. "So about Michael..."

Sean settled back into his chair. "I'm sure you heard Jesse Turner before,that's his real name. He's my aunt Daisy Sullivan's son-technically my cousin, not my 'cousin-cousin' if you catch my drift. His name here in the New York is Michael Sullivan. My aunt married into the Turners and left New York years ago. My cousin is the heir to the Turner family."

I frowned slightly. "I've heard Jesse Turner before, but why do you all call him Michael Sullivan?"

"Ancient history," Sean waved dismissively."My aunt had a falling out with the Turners years ago. My cousin visits the Sullivans every year,going by Michael Sullivan, but you know our Sullivan medical dynasty-if I don't take over, it falls to him. My grandfather's been hoping he'll return to the family business and change his name back to Sullivan!"

Sean leaned forward, his voice dropping conspiratorially. "Very few people in Manhattan know my cousin's true identity, so Mrs. Stark, I'd appreciate if you kept this between us!"
I cleared my throat, redirecting the conversation. "So what's the deal with my mother and your aunt Daisy? How do they know each other?"

"Another blast from the past," Sean sighed. "Years ago, my aunt was kidnapped. Your mother happened to be there and helped saveher life.So my aunt basically owes Elizabeth a favor-one she apparently decided to pass onto my cousin."

I grimaced, the pieces finally clicking into place. My mother had cashed in a life-debt to arrange a marriage for me. Classic Elizabeth Taylor move.

"I think I understand now," I sad, pinching the bridge of my nose. "Given what you've seen of my mother's personality, I should apologize.Please tell your cousin I'm sorry about all this. Really sorry."

Sean waved away my apology. "Don't sweat it. I know my cousin well-he hates being forced into anything. Your mother pretty much shot herself in the foot with this stunt. But this leaves you in a tough spot with her,doesn't it?"

A bitter smile crossed my face. "I wouldn't worry about me."

The understanding in Sean's eyes made me uncomfortable. I wasn't used to people seeing through the carefully constructed walls I'd built around my family issues.

My phone rang, breaking the moment. Brandon's name flashed on the screen.

"Hey," I answered, relieved by the distraiction.

"June," Brandon's voice came through, calm but with an undercurrent of tension."Where are you?"
"I'm with Sean in one of the guest lounges," I replied. "Everything's fine."

"Good. Come meet me and your grandparents. Both of you."

Before I could respond, Sean leaned toward the phone. "Brandon! What gives? You sent me here, and now you're checking up on us? Afraid I'll steal your wife?"

There was a brief pause before Brandon's voice returned, cool and deadly:"Sean, you're not even close to being a concern."

I bit back a smile as Sean's expression shifted from playful to slightly offended.

"We'll be right there," I said, ending the call before Sean could escalate things further. "Dr. Sullivan, shall we head out?"

Sean stood reluctantly. "Fine, fine. Your husband beckons."

We were almost at the door when I heard it-a faint,rhythmic thumping from the lounge next door, followed by what sounded distinctly like a moan. I froze, heat instantly rushing to my cheeks.

Sean's eyebrows shot up. "Summer, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't your sister book this entire floor for the wedding?"

I nodded, my face burning as another moan, louder this time, penetrated the wa1l.Oh god.

"Maybe we should..." I gestured toward the exit, desperately wanting to escape,

The sounds grew more insistent. I could feel my ears turning scarlet as I stared fixedly at the door handle.
Sean grabbed my arm, his eyes dancing with mischief. "Mrs. Stark, aren't you even a little curious what's going on in that Lounge during your sister's wedding?"

"Absolutely not!" I hissed, yanking my arm away. "Let's go!"

But before we could move, a woman's voice cried out, clear enough that there was no mistaking her words or who she was: "Alexander, harder!"

My heart stuttered painfully. Even though I'd long since moved on.hearing my former fiancé's name in such a context-at his own wedding,no less-was jarring. I stood frozen, a complex swirl of emotions washing over me-not jealousy, but something closer to secondhand embarrassment mixed with disbelief.

Sean's gaze softened with unexpected understanding. "Hey, you go ahead and find Brandon. I'll check out what's happening."

Before I could stop him, Sean was crossing to the balcony door. He slid it open and slipped outside with surprising agility. I watched, mouth agape,as he hoisted himself over the divider to the neighboring balcony.

*What the hell is he doing?*

I couldn't bring myself to follow, but neither could I leave. I paced the lounge, torn between fleeing to Brandon and waiting to see what Sean discovered. A mixture of horror and morbid curiosity kept me rooted in place.

Minutes later, Sean climbed back over the balcony divider,his phone in hand and a wicked grin on his face.

"What did you do?" I demanded as he closed the balcony door behind him.
"Nothing much," he replied innocently, pocketing his phone. "Just confirming some suspicions." He shook his head. "Seriously though,the guests are out there toasting the happy couple, and they couldn't even wait until after the reception? Talk about impatient."

I was already at the door, desperate to escape both the sounds and this excruciating conversation. "Sean, let's go!"

Sean sauntered out, looking far too pleased with himself. He caught up to me in the hallway, leaning close with that infuriating smirk still plastered across his face.

"Mrs. Stark," he whispered, voice dripping with insinuation, "don't you want to know what I saw in there?"

I shook my head firmly, face burning. "No, I absolutely do not."

The thought of Victoria and Alexander going at it on their wedding day,just rooms away from all their guests-including my grandparents-was mortifying enough without the details.

"Come on," I said, quickening my pace. "Brandon's waiting."
###Chapter 130: Fuck Her in the Wedding

Alexander's POV
The clinking of champagne glasses and the hum of polite laughter faded into a dull roar as I followed Victoria into the lounge. The door clicked shut behind us, sealing us off from the wedding reception—our wedding reception. My chest tightened, a chaotic mess of guilt and desire clawing at me. Summer's face flashed in my mind, her soft smile, the way her eyes used to light up when she looked at me. But then Victoria turned, her red lips curling into that wicked, knowing smirk, and my thoughts scattered like ash in the wind.
She was a vision in her wedding gown—white satin clinging to her figure, the elegance of the dress contrasting with the fire in her eyes. I'd tried to focus on the toasts and the endless parade of guests, but the proximity of her, the way she claimed me with every look, made my resolve crumble. She knew exactly the power she held over me.
"Alexander," she purred, stepping closer, her voice thick with a magnetic heat. "You've been so tense all day. Let me help you relax."
I swallowed hard, my throat dry. "Victoria, we shouldn't... this is our wedding. People are right outside—"
She pressed a finger to my lips, silencing me. "They are celebrating. No one is going to notice a few missing moments." Her hand slid up my chest, loosening my tie with practiced ease. "Besides, you are my husband now. Why look back?"
That word—husband—hit me like a heavy weight. She was my reality now, a choice I had made, yet the shadow of the past still lingered. But looking at Victoria, the sheer intensity of her presence drowned out the whispers of my conscience.
As she leaned in, our connection became a whirlwind of shared heat and desperate motion. The quiet lounge became a sanctuary where the outside world ceased to exist. Every touch was a silent battle between the man I used to be and the life I had stepped into. I felt the heat surging through me, a primal response to her touch that overwhelmed the nagging guilt in my mind.
We lost ourselves in the shadows of the room, the air growing heavy with a desperate, all-consuming energy. It was fierce and unyielding, a collision of two people bound together by more than just a marriage certificate. For those few moments, I let the fire consume the memories of what I had lost, focusing only on the sharp, electric reality of her presence.
When the intensity finally began to fade, we stayed like that for a moment, breathing heavily in the dim light. My heart pounded, the rush of the moment crashing into a wave of reality. Victoria looked up at me, a satisfied smile playing on her lips.
"See?" she said, her voice husky. "The world is still turning."
I forced a nod, straightening my clothes as that familiar ache of regret crept back in. Summer. She was out there somewhere, living a life I was no longer a part of, while I stood here, sealing myself into this new life with every breath.
Victoria stood, smoothing her hair and adjusting her gown with effortless grace, returning to the persona of the perfect bride. "Zip me up," she requested.
I obeyed, my fingers brushing her skin, sealing her back into the facade. As we prepared to slip back out into the reception, the sounds of our secret retreat still echoing in my mind, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was chasing a ghost I could never outrun—not even in the arms of my new wife.
###Chapter 131: A Shocking Discovery

Summer's POV

Sean raised an eyebrow, that infuriating smirk still playing on his lips. "You really don't want to know?" The suggestive tone in his voice made me want to smack him.

I lifted my gaze to meet his, staring him down with what I hoped was an icy glare. His smirk faltered slightly, a flicker of surprise crossing his face.

"Holy shit." he muttered, taking a half-step back. "That look... it's eerily similar to Brandon's death stare. Has anyone ever told you that you're starting to mirror your husband? It's kinda terrifying."

I maintained my stare, saying nothing.

"Seriously, stop looking at mne like that," Sean pleaded, his cocky demeanor cracking slightly. "It's freaky as hell. Brandon's bad enough-we don't need two of you doing that."

I finally relented, pressing my lips together. "Let's go," I repeated, turning toward the hallway that would lead uis back to the ballroom.

As I walked away, I could feel Sean hesitate behind me. When I glanced back, he was staring at the lounge door, something calculating in his expression that I hadn't seen before-a glimpse of the shrewd intelligence he usually masked with his playboy act.

The ballroom was still buzzing with activity when we returned. Heads turned in our direction, curious eyes tracking our movement across the polished floor.

I spotted Ruby and Scarlett at their table, their eyes widening when they
saw me enter with Sean. Their gazes immediately darted across the room to where Brandon sat with my grandfathers, appearing completely unbothered as he engaged them in conversation. If he was concerned about my disappearance with Sean, he didn't show it.

Ruby and Scarlett both knew Sean. Ruby caught my eye and raised her eyebrows in an exaggerated expression that clearly asked: *What the hell?*I smiled reassuringly and waved. Sean, noticing the exchange,flashed Ruby a wide grin that was probably meant to be charming but came across as slightly predatory.

I steered Sean toward Brandon's table before Ruby could interrogate us.Grandpa George and Professor Jonathan were deep in conversation with Brandon, but they looked up as we approached.

"Grandpa," I said, slipping into formal introductions, "this is Dr. Sean Sullivan. Dr. Sullivan, this is my grandfather George Taylor, and this is my maternal grandfather, Professor Jonathan Thompson." I paused slightly before gesturing to Brandon. "And this is Brandon Stark, my husband."

Brandon's hand tightened almost imperceptibly around his teacup, a flash of pleasure crossing his face at my words. He looked up, his dark eyes meeting mine with an·intensity that made my stomach flutter. His lips curved into that slight, private smile he reserved just for me.

"Dr. Sullivan," Brandon acknowledged, his voice deceptively pleasant."Welcome."

Sean's eye twitched, his gaze darting between Brandon and me. His smile looked more like a grimace as he replied, "The infamous Brandon Stark. I've heard so much about you, Meeting you in person is... quite something."

Brandon calmly poured a cup of tea and offered it to Sean. "Try some?"
"Thanks," Sean said, accepting the cup with obvious reluctance.He turned to my grandfathers, his charm cranked back up to maximum. "Mr. Taylor,Professor Thompson, it's truly an honor to meet you both."

Grandpa George smiled kindly. "Good, good! It's always nice to meet young people like yourself."

I noticed Grandpa's slightly confused expression and leaned close to his ear. "Grandpa, Mom tried to set me up with Dr. Sullivan's cousin, Michael Sullivan, who's actually Jesse Turner. Sean is friends with Brandon, and they knew about Mom's plan in advance. Michael-I mean Jesse-wasn't interested in the arrangement either, so Sean came in his place."

Understanding dawned in Grandpa's eyes, and he looked at Brandon with new appreciation. Brandon caught his approving glance and smiled slightly, his eyes drifting to me with a warmth that made me blush.
Sean cleared his throat loudly, tapping his fingers on the table. "Could you two maybe tone down the eye-fucking? We're in public, for Christ's sake."

"Problem?" Brandon asked, his voice silky with danger.

Sean backpedaled quickly. "Not at all! Actually, I've got something interesting to show you."

He moved to Brandon's other side and attempted to drape his arm casually over Brandon's shoulder. Brandon immediately brushed him off,his expression hardening.

"Sorry, forgot you're not the touchy-feely type," Sean said with a nervous laugh,withdrawing his arm.

From the corner of my eye, I could see other wedding guests watching our table with barely concealed curiosity. No one dared approach, though-
Brandon's presence had that effect on people.

"Summer," Grandpa George said after a while, "Jonathan and I are thinking of leaving soon. This affair is getting rather tedious."
"Already?" I asked, glancing around. "Would you like Brandon and me to take you home?"

Professor Jonathan immediately shook his head. "Not necessary. George and I can entertain ourselves with conversation, maybe take a walk. It's too stuffy in here."
Brandon caught my eye, giving me a subtle nod. I understood his silent message-let them go if they wanted to.
"Okay, but please be careful," I said, unable to suppress my concern for the two elderly men.
Grandpa George chuckled. "We'll be fine! We have drivers waiting. We'll just say our goodbyes to your parents and be on our way."
After they left, an awkward silence fell over our table. I fidgeted uncomfortably, not sure what to say with just Sean and Brandon remaining.

Brandon, sensing my discomfort, glanced around the room. "Why don't you invite your friends to join us?"

"Really? Is that okay?" I asked, surprised by his suggestion.

He nodded."Go ahead,"

I quickly texted Ruby and Scarlett, who had been looking increasingly miserable at their original table. They practically jumped up at my
invitation, weaving through the crowd to reach us.

"Mr. Stark, Dr. Sullivan," they greeted as they approached.

She sat down beside me, tugging my arm. "Won't people talk if we suddenly move to Brandon Stark's table? This seems pretty conspicuous."

"Don't worry about it." I assured her. "You're my friends, and I invited you. That's all that matters."

Ruby nodded, though she still looked nervous. She turned to Sean with obvious reluctance. "So, Dr. Sullivan, what brings you to Victoria's wedding?"

"Why shouldn't I be here?" he countered with a lazy smile. "You're here.aren't you?"

Brandon interrupted before their banter could escalate. "You said you had something to show me." His tone made it clear he wasn't asking. "What is it?"
Sean's expression shifted to something more serious as he reached for his phone.
###Chapter 132: Summer, I Like You
Summer's POV

I watched as Sean pulled out his phone, his usual playful demeanor shifting to something more calculated. The mischievous glint in his eyes took on a sharp edge that made me instantly wary.

"So," Sean leaned toward Brandon with a grin that screamed trouble. "I happened to witness a rather... enlightening scene while I was escorting Summer earlier. It seems our friends aren't as composed as they’d like us to believe."

Sean swiped through his phone before holding it out to Brandon. "Caught a bit of a performance backstage. Take a look—it might serve as a decent leverage someday."

Brandon glanced at the screen, his expression remaining an unreadable mask. "Did she see this?" he asked, his voice dropping an octave.

I felt Brandon's eyes flick toward me for a fraction of a second.

"Are you kidding?" Sean replied, looking almost offended. "What kind of gentleman do you think I am? I made sure Summer was well out of the lounge before I even looked. I just thought you should be aware of the... lack of discretion on their part."

"Oh! Look who’s decided to rejoin the party," Sean suddenly announced, his tone entirely too gleeful as he nodded toward the entrance.

I turned to see Victoria and Alexander making their reappearance. Victoria had changed into a champagne-colored cocktail dress. Her hair, which had been perfectly styled earlier, looked slightly rushed despite her obvious attempts to fix it. Alexander looked... well, like a man who had just realized the weight of the spotlight.

"Alexander looks like he's barely keeping up with the expectations," Sean muttered under his breath. "I didn't think he had the patience for her drama."

I felt a wave of discomfort as the implication of their "disorganized" appearance sank in.

Brandon's knuckles rapped sharply against the table, a sound like a gavel. It silenced Sean immediately. The warning in that simple gesture was unmistakable—some things were not to be discussed in front of me.

Ruby leaned close to me, whispering, "What is Sean implying?"

"Trust me, you don't want the details," I whispered back. "And if you value your peace of mind, never ask Dr. Sullivan for a follow-up report."

Across the room, Victoria was practically clinging to Alexander's arm, her face flushed with a performance of triumph. Alexander’s eyes swept the room, eventually landing on our table. When he spotted me sitting between Brandon and Sean, his entire demeanor darkened. His jaw tightened, and his eyes narrowed with a flicker of something that looked dangerously like regret mixed with jealousy. It wasn't the look of a man who had moved on.

As the reception wound down, guests began filtering out. I checked my watch, realizing the evening had finally reached its limit.

"We should probably head out too," I suggested to Ruby and Scarlett.

Before they could respond, Elizabeth materialized at our table, her smile brittle and forced. "Summer, darling," she said, pointedly ignoring my friends, "I’ve arranged for Michael to drive you home. It’s far too late for a young woman to be out alone."

I stared at her in disbelief. "That's not necessary, Mother. I have my own car."

"Nonsense! I insist. It would be rude to refuse his kindness." Her fingers brushed my arm with a firm, controlling pressure.

Sean, playing his role with unexpected grace, stood and offered a polite nod to Elizabeth. "Mrs. Taylor, it would be my pleasure to ensure Summer arrives safely. You have my word on her security."

I shot Brandon a glance. He nodded slightly—a silent signal that we’d follow our plan. I quickly texted him: "Please make sure Ruby and Scarlett get home safely."

"Fine," I conceded, rising to follow Sean.

Brandon remained seated, perfectly composed. To the room, he appeared indifferent, but I caught the slight tension in his jaw—he wasn't fond of the arrangement, but he trusted me to navigate the exit.

Outside, the night air was cool. Sean led me toward his car, but a voice cut through the quiet of the parking lot.

"Summer! Wait!"

I turned to see Chris Diaz jogging toward us, looking frantic. He had been watching me all evening, but I’d successfully avoided a direct encounter until now.

"Chris?" I asked, my impatience clear. "Is something wrong?"

Chris glanced at Sean, then back to me. "Can we talk? Privately? Just for a minute."

Sean made no move to leave, merely leaning against his car with a raised eyebrow. "Dr. Sullivan," Chris tried again, "would you mind giving us a moment? I can drive Summer home afterward."

Sean said nothing, simply crossing his arms with an amused, steady gaze. He wasn't moving unless I told him to.

I sighed. "Chris, whatever you have to say, you can say it here. I really need to get home."

Chris’s eyes flashed with frustration. "It’s important, Summer. Please."

"Fine," I relented, stepping a few paces away from the car. "What is it?"

Chris reached for my hand, but I immediately pulled away, maintaining a clear boundary. His face fell, rejection written in the lines of his forehead.

"Summer," he began, his voice slightly unsteady, "I... I’ve realized something. I’ve liked you for a long time—since college, actually. That night at the Manhattan Club, I didn't get a chance to tell you. I don't want to wait anymore. Would you consider giving us a chance? Be my girlfriend?"

The silence of the night felt heavy. Behind him, I could see Sean watching with keen interest, and I knew Brandon was likely not far behind. I looked at Chris, feeling nothing but a profound sense of closure for a past that no longer belonged to me.


###Chapter 133: That's Just Life

**Summer's POV**

Sean lounged against his car, clearly entertained by the unfolding drama.

I suppressed a sigh. The last thing I wanted after this exhausting day was a public confession. I'd spent hours navigating Victoria's wedding.watching Alexander's pathetic longing glances, and dealing with my mother's matchmaking schemes. Now this.
I gave Chris a cool once-over, then shot Sean a warning glance that he completely ignored, his amused smirk only growing wider.*Great.An audience.*

"Chris," I began, keeping my voice deliberately even, "I never properly thanked you for what happened at Manhattan Club that night. You saved me, and I'm genuinely grateful."

Chris shifted his weight from one foot to the other, looking simultaneously encouraged and uncertain.

"Is there something else?" I asked, though I already knew exactly what was coming.

"Summer," Chris blurted out, his voice slightly higher than normal, "saving you was the least I could do, especially since you're the girl I like!" He took a deep breath, gathering courage. "So, what do you think? I likeyou,Summer. Will you be my girlfriend?"

He shot an irritated glance at Sean, who made absolutely no effort to give us privacy, instead looking more entertained with each passing second.I knew that look on Sean's face-the same expression he'd worn earlier
when peering into the lounge where Victoria and Alexander were... well.celebrating their marriage.
"I understand," I said, pinching the bridge of my nose. "Is there anything else?"

Chris's brow furrowed. "Summer! You haven't answered me! I just confessed my feelings to you, and you haven't given me a response!"

My patience, already worn thin by the day's events, finally snapped. I fixed him with a cold stare.

"What kind of answer are you looking for, Chris? You've told me you like me at least three times now, and I've responded each time. What more do you want?"

Chris stared at me, visibly shocked by my tone. "What? You... you didn't answer me!"

"I did answer you," I replied, my voice turning icy. "I thanked you for saving me. I said I understood. But you keep pushing, and my attitude should be clear enough. Yes, you saved me, and I'm grateful. But gratitude doesn't mean I have to like you. Chris, we're classmates, and I'd prefer not to make things awkward between us."

Chris's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water. "But you never said you don't like me!"

I let out a humorless laugh. "So because I didn't explicitly say I don't like you,you assumed I do? I was being polite, trying to save your dignity.But now it's somehow my fault? Are you looking for the answer I can give,or the answer you want to hear? If I don't give you the answer you want,are you going to keep pestering me all night?"
The wind picked up, blowing strands of hair across my face. I didn't bother pushing them away,too focused on the confrontation.
"I'm typically a patient person, but my patience is running out. Since you're demanding an explicit answer, here it is: I don't like you. Not even a little bit. Is that clear enough for you?"
Chris's face fell, genuine hurt flashing in his eyes. "I've liked you for so many years,Summer."

"That's your business," I replied, unmoved. "Your feelings are your responsibility, not mine. I'm not obligated to reciprocate just because you've persisted."

Chris clutched at his chest dramatically. "But why? We've been classmates for years. You know I've liked you since college, and you never pushed me away. I thought that with time, you'd eventually feel the same."

"Not all feelings are mutual, Chris," I explained, trying to soften my tone slightly. "That's just life. Your feelings for me are your own, but you can't use them to manipulate me."

Chris suddenly pointed at Sean, his expression hardening. "What about him? I overheard your mother earlier-he's the guy she set you1 up with!You're willing to give him a chance, so why not me?"

I followed Chris's accusatory finger to Sean, who looked positively delighted by this new development. Sean raised an eyebrow, his gorgeous face lighting up with mischief. With his model-like features and those distinctive bedroom eyes, I could see why Chris might feel threatened-though if he only knew the truth, he'd realize how absurd this comparison was.
Sean didn't say a word, just fixed me with that amused gaze that silently communicated: *This is getting interesting.* I shot him a warning look,which he completely ignored.

"That's none of your business," I told Chris firmly. "Who I spend time with is my choice."

"What about me?" Chris pressed.

"You? I've already told you-you're a friend. That's all."

"Summer," Chris pleaded, his voice softening. "I'm not asking for an immediate yes. Just one chance. We've known each other for years-you know what kind of person I am. You just met him, and you barely know him. If you're giving him a chance, why not me? I'm not asking for much,just for you to be fair. One opportunity is all I need-I know you'll fall for me!"

His voice took on an accusing edge. "Is it because of his status?Because he's richer than me?"

That was it. The last thread of my patience snapped.

"Enough!" I said, my voice cutting through the night air. "Don't you get it?This isn't about how long we've known each other. It's about what I want.I don't want to date you. I don't want to give you a chance. It doesn't matter how long we've known each other-I didn't like you before, I don't like you now, and I certainly won't like you in the future."

I rubbed my temple, a headache forming. "Think whatever you want.Nothing will happen between us. You've wasted enough of my time. I've said everything I needed to say, and I'm done discussing this. Please don't bother me again."
Without waiting for his response, I yanked open the car door and slid into the passenger seat, slamming it shut behind me. Through the window,I could see Chris standing there, face dark with anger, hands clenched into fists.

Sean and Chris stared each other down. Even through the closed window,I could see the tension between them.

"Don't think you're so great just because you're rich," Chris spat at Sean."Summer's just temporarily confused. She'll see through you eventually, and she'll fall for me!"

Sean straightened from his relaxed position against the car, crossing his arms with a smirk. He towered over Chris, his lean frame suddenly looking imposing.

"Even if I wasn't in the picture, she still wouldn't look at you," Sean replied with a cold smile. "No matter what you do, Summer will never like you, let alone love you."
He paused, his eyes narrowing. "If you really liked her, you'd understand who she is. Yet you just accused the woman you claim to love of being a gold-digger. I doubt your feelings are genuine at all."

Sean slid one hand casually into his pocket. "You can always get what you want. Some men earn a woman's heart, others never will. You're clearly in the latter category-and clearly lacking the ability to ever change that!"

Before Chris could respond, Sean circled the car and slipped into the driver's seat. The engine roared to life, and we pulled away.
###Chapter 134: You Look Cute When You're Jealous

**Brandon's POV**
I heard Sean's sports car pull up outside my Hamptons estate well past the time June should have been home.Opening the door before June could use her key. I found Sean behind hner with that insufferable grin, while June looked exhausted in her formal dress.

"You're late," I said, stepping aside to let them in.

June leaned up, pressing a quick kiss to my cheek. "Sorry. It's been... quite an evening."

I felt myself soften involuntarily at her touch.

"You two catch up," she said, slipping off her heels. "I'll go grab Sean some water!"

The moment June disappeared into the kitchen, Sean sprawled across my sofa,propping his feet on the coffee table like he owned the place. I stood nearby, watching with mounting irritation.

I kicked his feet off the table with enough force to make him wince.

"Sit properly," I said, keeping my voice deliberately calm.

Sean straightened immediately, rubbing his shin. "Jesus, Brandon. A simple 'please'would've worked."

June returned with water, handing it-to Sean before settling into an armchair.
一
"Brandon," Sean continued, expression growing mischievous, "you missed quite the show after you left. I got to witness something truly entertaining."

I raised an eyebrow, instantly aler. "Is that so?"

"Oh yeah," Sean grinned. "You might want to keep a closer eye on your wife. She just got confessed to right in front of me. Some guy actually had the balls to ask her out while I was standing right there!"

A cold fury settled in my chest. "Who?" I demanded, my mind already cataloging ways to destroy whoever had dared approach June.

"Don't listen to Sean." June interjected quickly. "It was just a college classmate. Seriously, it was nothing."

"Hmm," I responded, studying her face carefully.

"I need to discuss something with Sean," I said, making a swift decision."
Why don't you go upstairs andget some rest?"


"Are you sure?" June asked.

"Go ahead," I insisted. "I won't be long."

After she left, I turned to Sean, dropping all pretense of civility.


"Her classmate?" I demanded. "Which one?"

"I knew you wouldn't be able to play it cool!" Sean leaned back, entirely too comfortable. "Remember that alumni reunion? The one where your wife got bitten by a snake? Well, this guy played the hero, sucking the venom out like some dramatic movie scene."

"What did he say to June?" I pressed.
"Nothing much, really," Sean admitted. "Based on what I saw, your wife had absolutely no interest in him. The real problem now is my cousin Jesse."

"Jesse Turner has no interest in June," I stated flatly.

"True, he doesn't," Sean confirmed. "But my aunt Daisy owes your mother-in-law a favor. You know what Elizabeth is like. Now that she's found a connection to the Sullivan family, she definitely won't back down easily.Your wife is going to have a tough time ahead. Though honestly,my cousin isn't a bad option. I have to give them credit for good taste!"

His flippant remark pushed me to the edge of my patience. My glare must have been effective because Sean's bravado faltered visibly.

"Whoa, why are you looking at me like that?" he asked.

"Isn't it obvious?" I replied coolly. "We still have you, don't we? From now on,you'll continue playing your role as Michael Sullivan."
Sean's eyes widened in alarm. "Hey, wait! Brandon, I only agreed to help this one time! You can't expect me to keep doing this. She's your wife-.aren't you concerned about having me around her?"

"I trust you," I stated simply. "You'll cooperate with me on this."

"I consider you guys like brothers," Sean protested. "You can't do this to me!"

"I know you'll help," I said, rising. "It's getting late. You should go."

After showing a still-grumbling Sean out, I headed to my study.The blueprint spread across my desk provided a welcome distraction from thoughts of men pursuing my wife.
I lost track of time until a soft voice interrupted my concentration.


"Still up?"
I looked up to find June standing in the doorway, wearing one of my t-shirts. Her hair was damp from the shower, and she looked impossibly soft.

"Shouldn't you be asleep?" I asked, my work instantly forgotten.

"Couldn't sleep without you," she admitted. "What are you working on so late?"

"Manhattan West Side development project," I replied, gesturing to the blueprints. "The bidding starts next month. Just getting prepared."

As she moved closer, I pushed my chair back and reached for her.

"Come here," I said, pulling her onto my lap.

She yelped in surprise. "What are you doing? Don't you have work to finish?"

"Almost done," I murmured, tightening my arms around her. "Couldn't sleep?"

June shook her head. "I feel weirdly energized. Probably because I've been so lazy lately, just hanging around the house all day."

"Is that so?" I asked, brushing my lips against hers. "It has nothing to do with tonight?"

"Tonight?" she echoed, confused.

I felt my eyes narrow. "Sean mentioned a certain classmate of yours. The one who confessed."
Understanding dawned in her eyes, and her lips curved into a grin. "Brandon Stark, are you jealous?"
"Jealous?" I scoffed, tightening my grip on her. "Of course not.Why would I be jealous?"

"Mmhmm," she hummed, clearly not believing me. "You're absolutely not jealous."

"Exactly," I agreed, maintaining my serious expression. "I'm not jealous at all."

She leaned forward, pressing her lips to mine in a kiss that quickly deepened. I felt desire surge through me as my hand moved to cup the back of her neck.

"You're mine," I murmured against her lips. "Why would I need to be jealous?"

"You don't," she assured me, threading her fingers through my hair. "You have absolutely no reason to be jealous. Because apart from you. I couldn't possibly like anyone else."

"That's better," I replied. "But don't think sweet talk will let you off the hook. What's the deal with this guy?"

I noticed her mind wandering and pinched her side playfully, making her squirm.

"Ow! Why are you pinching me?" she protested.

"What are you thinking about?" I demanded. "You're with me but thinking about another man?"
"What? No!" she exclaimed. "I'm not thinking about anyone else!"

"Good," I said, relaxing slightly. "Because you shouldn't be."

June rolled her eyes. "Why would I think about anyone else when I have the perfect man right in front of me? Wait, I get it now. You're insecure!The great Brandon Stark, feeling threatened by a random college classmate!



"Insecure? Me?" I felt my eyebrow arch dangerously.

"It's okay to admit it," she teased. "But really, Brandon, you're like the most eligible bachelor in New York-well, former bachelor now. Ónly a complete idiot would pass up being with you for someone else."

"No," I conceded, lips quirking upward. "You're not an idiot. That's why you ended up with me." My expression sobered. "But that doesn't mean I can stop annoying people from pursuing you. You didn't see how many people were looking at you today. I didn't like it."
June laughed softly. "What people? Nobody was looking at me. All eyes were on you! Not just women staring at you, but men too. If anyone should be feeling insecure,it's me."

I slid my hands to her hips, securing her more firmly on my lap.

"Brandon," she whispered, pressing a light kiss to the corner of my mouth.
"You know what? You look really cute when you're jealous."
###Chapter 135:A Moment of Celebration

Brandon's POV
I felt my eyes widen slightly at June's unexpected observation. For a moment, I almost protested, but then caught myself, letting my expression shift into a smile.
"Cute, am I?" I murmured, my voice dropping lower.
She nodded, her breath hitching slightly as I stepped closer. My work was instantly forgotten as I stood, lifting her with me. "Let me show you just how much I appreciate that 'cute' remark," I whispered as I carried her toward our bedroom.
The bedroom door clicked shut behind us, and I set June down gently on the edge of the bed. Her damp hair clung to her shoulders, and she looked up at me with a grin, her eyes sparkling with that teasing light I couldn't resist. Calling me cute—she knew exactly how to get under my skin.
"You're playing a dangerous game, Mrs. Stark," I said, my voice low and warm as I brushed my fingers along her jaw. I tilted her chin up, leaning down until our noses nearly touched. June's lips quirked, her hands sliding up my chest. "Maybe I like dangerous," she murmured, her tone all honey and mischief. "Especially when it's you."
That was it—I was done for. I kissed her, slow and deep, savoring the way she melted into me. Her lips were soft and pliant, and a hum of satisfaction rumbled in my chest. In the quiet of our room, the world outside—the corporate battles and the heavy responsibilities—faded away.
We spent the night lost in each other, a whirlwind of shared heat and unspoken promises. Every touch was a celebration of the bond we had built, a deep and rhythmic connection that needed no crude words to be understood. I took my time, wanting her to feel every bit of the devotion I felt for her.
As the hours blurred together, the intensity of our connection only grew. It wasn't just about the physical closeness; it was the way she looked at me, with absolute trust and affection. When we finally collapsed together, tangled and exhausted, her head rested on my chest as our breathing evened out.
"Still think I'm cute?" I asked, brushing a kiss to her forehead.
June tilted her head up, her smile soft and sated. "Maybe a little," she admitted. "But mostly... perfect."
"Good answer," I murmured, pulling her tighter against me. Work could wait. Right now, she was all I needed.

###Chapter 136: The First Day
Brandon's POV
June's soft warmth lingered against me as we lay tangled in the sheets. I'd barely caught my own breath when she stirred, reaching for her tablet on the nightstand. I groaned, tugging her back playfully. "Seriously? You're checking emails now?"
"Just a sec," she mumbled, her voice drowsy but determined. I watched her scroll, her face illuminated by the screen's glow. She looked adorable—hair mussed and eyes bright—and I was about to pull her back when her eyes widened.
"Brandon!" she squeaked, launching herself at me. I barely had time to brace myself before she tackled me, her arms wrapping around my neck. "I got into Stark Group! They accepted me!"
She was practically bouncing, her grin infectious, and I laughed, catching her before she toppled us both off the bed. "I knew you'd nail it, June. I'm proud of you."
She beamed, her hands cupping my face. "Wait. You didn't pull any strings, did you?"
I chuckled, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. "Me? Never. I told you, you're brilliant. Stark Group would've been crazy not to take you." I tugged her closer, my lips brushing hers. "Any company would."
June giggled, but then she glanced at the clock and sighed. "It's late. I should sleep—big day tomorrow. First day at work with you."
"Mm-hmm," I agreed, though I wasn't quite ready to let the night end. We shared another moment of closeness, a gentle but lingering celebration of her success. By the time we finally drifted off to sleep, the sense of shared excitement for our future together was overwhelming.
The next morning, I was up first, feeling more energized than I had in weeks. June, meanwhile, was a sight—moving a bit slowly as she crawled out of bed, scowling at me with a half-hearted glare.
"June, shoes," I said, nodding at the slippers by the bed.
She huffed, hands on her hips. "Brandon, I swear, you have too much energy. I'm exhausted."
I raised an eyebrow, rinsing my toothbrush. "Not my fault you're irresistible. But I promise to be gentle tonight."
"Tonight?" she squeaked, whirling around with toothpaste in hand. "I need to focus on work!"
I just smiled, leaning in to kiss her forehead. "Get ready. I'll make breakfast. You've got a big day ahead, Mrs. Stark."
By the time she came down, I had coffee brewing and breakfast on the table. She walked in wearing an understated but elegant sweater paired with a light coat. She looked stunning, though she was fidgeting with her hair.
"What do you think?" she asked nervously.
I let my eyes linger, taking her in. Finally, I nodded. "You look like you're about to own that place. Which you will."
She relaxed, a shy grin breaking through. "Thanks, Brandon. For everything."
"Anytime," I said, pushing a plate her way. "Now eat. We've got work to do."
###Chapter 137:Favoritism

**Brandon's POV**

June wanted to keep a low profile at work, so she turned down my offer to drive her.

James was already waiting when I arrived at Stark Tower.

"Mr. Stark," he began. "Leo Schmidt sent an email to Mrs. Stark yesterday."

"She's coming in today," I replied, stepping into the elevator. I waited for James to join me before pressing the button for the executive floor. "Tell Leo not to give her any special treatment. Treat her like any other employee."

I considered for a moment, then added, "Schedule a meeting with all department heads at nine.

"Yes. Mr. Stark." Jamnes confirmed, making a note on his tablet.

As the elevator doors opened, I spotted Monica at her desk. James paused briefly to relay my instructions, and I noticed the barely concealed curiosity in her eyes when Summer's name was mentioned. She wouldn't dare ask questions directly, but the office grapevine was already buzzing with speculation about the new hire who had caught my attention.

I shrugged off my suit jacket and settled behind my desk, opening my laptop to scan through the morning's emails. James entered a few minutes later, clearing his throat slightly before speaking.

"Mr.Stark, regarding the Manhattan West Side development project..."

I gestuared for him to continue, not looking up from my screen.
"Mr. William Stark has requested that we allocate a portion to Fortune Corp." His tone was careful, neutral-he knew this was delicate territory.

I closed my email slowly, a cold feeling settling in my chest. My fingers tapped rhythmically against the polished surface of my desk as I considered this information. William going behind my back again, trying to play puppet master with Stark Group resources.Typical.
"So," I said finally, my voice dangerously soft, "they want a piece of the Manhattan West Side project." A humorless smile pulled at my lips. "Well.they're welcome to try, but they'll need to prove they can handle it. That's not a small bite to swallow."

James nodded, his expression carefully blank. "Should I prepare a response to Mr. William Stark?"

"Not yet." I leaned back in my chair. "How are things progressing with Victoria at Stark Entertainment?"

"Her film begins shooting in a few days. The other projects are still under evaluation."

James hesitated. "Shall we... arrange for some difficulties?"

"Difficulties?" I echoed, a slight smile playing on my lips. "No, James. Let's give her some sweeteners first."

James looked puzzled. "Sir?"

"Have you ever watched a cat play with a mouse?" I asked, my tone conversational. "The cat doesn't immediately kill its prey. It plays with it-letting it escape, catching it again, exhausting it completely before the final strike. We'll feed her well first."
I took out a folder. "Start working on this immediately. That's how we'll handle Victoria... and Fortune Corp."

"Of course, Mr. Stark." James accepted the folder I handed him. "I'll take care of it right away."




The conference room was tense when I entered precisely at nine. The department heads had clearly been caught off guard by the sudden meeting-some still clutching coffee cups, others frantically reviewing notes.

"Good morning," I began, taking my seat at the head of the table. "Í trust you're all prepared to discuss the status of your departments."

The Finance Director cleared his throat nervously. "Mr. Stark, we weren't given much notice for this meeting-"

"And that's precisely the problem," I cut in, my voice level but sharp. "If your department is running efficiently, you should be able to provide a status report at any time, without advance warning."

I turned to the Investment Director. "Where do we stand on the Manhattan West Side development plan?"

"We're... still in the preliminary stages," he stammered. "The area presents significant challenges-"

"I want a comprehensive development proposal on my desk by the end of the week," I interrupted. "Not preliminary thoughts, not considerations-a detailed plan ready for execution."

For the next hour, I systematically worked my way through each department, identifying weaknesses, demanding solutions, and setting
aggressive deadlines. By the time I concluded the meeting, there wasn't a relaxed face in the room. Everyone fled with a renewed sense of urgency,except for Leo Schmidt, whom I asked to stay behind.

"Leo," I said once we were alone. "What's your assessment of the Manhattan West Side project?"

Leo straightened his glasses, gathering his thoughts. "The risks are extremely high, Mr. Stark. The location is on the urban periphery, with several abandoned properties. There's a psychiatric hospital and a rehabilitation center nearby. It's generally been considered unsuitable for development."

I held up a hand, stopping him. "The city has indicated those facilities might be relocated. The exact boundaries haven't been finalized yet,so we don't know if those institutions will even be within our development zone."

I leaned forward, making my position clear. "We need to prepare appropriate safety measures, but I intend to acquire and develop that land.This will be one of Stark Group's most significant real estate projects in recent years."

Leo nodded, making notes. After a moment of hesitation, he looked up. "Mr. Stark, may I ask something...personal?"

I raised an eyebrow. "Go ahead."

"That Summer Taylor woman-your new hire." He paused, choosing his words carefully. "May I ask what she is to you? I don't mean to overstep.but I've never known you to show favoritism in business matters. Can't say that I think highly of Fortune Corp or its employee."

"You think this is favoritism?" I asked, my tone neutral.
Leo glanced nervously at James, who suddenly found the view from the window fascinating.

"I... well..." Leo fumbled for words.

"If you believe it's favoritism, then that's what it is," I said with a slight shrug. "And I might as well go all the way with it."

I stood. signaling the conversation was ending. "Take good care of her.Assign her to promising projects. She has previous experience in project management. but her exposure has been limited. Since you've already accused me of favoritism, let's embrace it fully."

I straightened my tie, making my final point crystal 'clear. "Give her the best resources. Help her get up to speed quickly. And include her in the Manhattan West Side development team."

Leo's expression was a mixture of confusion and resignation. "Yes, Mr.Stark."
###Chapter 138: Summer's First Day

**Summer's POV**

My heart thudded against my ribs as I pushed through the revolving doors of Stark Tower. The gleaming lobby stretched before me-all polished marble and sleek surfaces, the Stark logo prominently displayed behind the recepotion desk. I'd been here before, of course, but today was different. Today, I wasn't visiting Brandon or being escorted to a conference room for an interview. Today, I was an employee.

"Good morning," I greeted the receptionist, straightening my shoulders. "I m Summer Taylor. It's my first day in the Projects Division."

The woman glanced up, her professional smile in place as she checked her computer. "Ah, yes. Ms. Taylor. Welcome to Stark Group." She handed me a temporary ID badge. "Please take the elevator to the fourteenth floor. Mr.Schmidt's office is at the end of the main hallway."

I nodded my thanks, clipping the badge to my sweater. As I headed toward the elevators, I caught myself walking taller, chin lifted slightly.Being here as an actual employee felt surreal-like I was playing dress-up in someone else's life. Brandon and I had agreed to keep our relationship under wraps at work, at least for now. I needed to prove myself on my own merits, not as "the boss's wife."

The elevator whisked me to the fourteenth floor, and I followed the signs toward the Projects Division. I'd been here once before for my interview with Leo Schmidt, so I navigated the corridors with relative ease. As I approached Leo's office, a petite woman with a sleek bob and impeccable style intercepted me.

"Ms. Summer Taylor?" she asked, her eyes quickly scanning me from head
to toe.
"Yes, that's me," I confirmed.
Her face brightened. "I'm Heather Bell. Director Schmidt's assistant. He mentioned first thing this morning that a Ms. Taylor would be coming in today!" She extended her hand, which I shook. "Everyone's been wondering about our unexpected new team member."
"It"snice to meet you, Heather," I replied, returning her friendly smile."I hope I'm not too early."
"Not at all! Director Schmidt asked me to help you get settled." She gestured for me to follow her. "Let me introduce you to a few colleagues first, then we'll head to HR to handle your onboarding paperwork."

As we walked down the corridor, Heather glanced at me curiously."You know, you look really familiar. Where did you work before joining us?"

I kept my smile in place, carefully sidestepping the question. "Oh, nothing special. Just a smaller firm you probably haven't heard of." The last thing I needed was for people to connect me with Fortune Corp on my first day.

"Really?" Heather looked unconvinced. "You definitely don't have an ordinary face. I would have remembered meeting someone like you before."

I laughed it off. "Trust me, I've just got one of those faces that looks like someone else. Happens all the time."

"If you say so," she conceded, though her tone suggested she didn't buy it for a second. "Though I'm pretty sure someone with your... presence wouldn't go unnoticed anywhere."

We entered a large open office space where several people were busy at
their desks. Conversations hushed as we walked in, curious eyes following our progress across the room. I felt like a new exhibit at the zoo.
"Everyone," Heather announced, "this is Summer Taylor, our newest team member in Projects."

A chorus of greetings followed, along with not-so-subtle whispers. I caught snippets like "mid-quarter hire" and "not the usual process." Clearly,my arrival was causing a stir.

An hour later, I was officially an employee of Stark Group. I had an ID badge. login credentials, and my own desk in the Projects Division.Heather had provided me with folders containing past projects for review.

"Director Schmidt said to familiarize yourself with these," she explained."They're examples of our completed projects from the past two years."

Left alone at my new workstation, I flipped through the files, trying to get a feel for the division's work style. The projects were impressive-large-scale commercial developments, high-end residential complexes, and mixed-use urban renewal initiatives. The scope made Fortune Corp's projects look like child's play.

I felt a wave of uncertainty. What exactly was I supposed to do here? I hadn't been assigned any specific tasks yet, and I had no idea what Leo Schmidt expected from me. Was I supposed to jump in and offer input on ongoing projects? Wait to be assigned something specific? I was used to having clear objectives, not this ambiguous welcome.

As I pondered these questions, a shadow fell across my desk. I looked up to find Leo Schmidt standing there, his expression unreadable.

"Ms. Taylor," he said, his voice clipped and professional, "please come to
my office for a moment."

My stomach tightened with anxiety as I followed him. His officelooked the same as during my interview, except his desk wasn't buried under mountains of paperwork this time.

"Please, sit." he gestured to the chair across from his desk.

I smoothed my skirt and sat down, trying to project confidence despite my racing heart.

"Ms. Taylor," Leo began, "now that you've passed the evaluation process, I'd like to welcome you to the Projects Division. I look forward to our collaboration and mutual growth."

His formaI tone caught me off guard. "Thank you, Director Schmidt.And please,call me Summer."

Leo studied me with unexpected intensity, as if trying to solve a puzzle. "Very well, Summer. I noticed you were reviewing our past project files.What are your impressions so far?"

I blinked, surprised by the direct question. "Oh! Well, they're very comprehensive and well-executed. I noticed that several Stark Group shopping centers follow a similar construction model, which seems to work well. Beyond that..." I hesitated, then decided honesty was best."Truthfully, while I worked in a projects department before, I have a lot to learn about operations at this scale."

Leo's eyebrows rose slightly, as if my admission of ignorance wasn't what he'd expected. After a moment, he nodded.

"Actually, reviewing files can only teach you so much," he said, standing abruptly. "I've always preferred practical experience over theoretical
learning."
He reached for his suit jacket hanging on a nearby coat rack. "You've just arrived and don't have any assignments yet."

"Are you heading out?" I asked, watching as he collected a folder from his drawer.

"Yes. And since you're free, you'll come with me," he stated matter-of-factly.

"Now?" I blurted out.
###Chapter 139: To The Site

**Summer's POV**

"Now?" I blurted out. Realizing how unprofessional I sounded, I quickly corrected myself. "I mean, of course! Give me just a moment to get organized, and I'll join you right away!"

"I'll wait outside." Leo said, turning toward the door.

I quickly grabbed my notebook and pen, shoved them in my bag.and straightened my outfit. When I stepped into the hallway, Leo looked surprised at how fast I'd gotten ready. Before he could comment, Heather Bell approached with a folder clutched in her hands.

"Director Schmidt," she called, slightly breathless, "are you heading to the site? I've prepared these documents you requested."
"Good." Leo glanced at me, then back to Heather. "You won't need to accompany me today. Ms. Taylor will be joining me instead."

Heather's eyes widened. "But sir, she just started-"

"I'm aware," Leo cut her off. "Have those numbers fixed by the time I return."

Heather nodded stiffly. "Of course, Director Schmidt."

As Leo walked away, Heather gave me a calculating look. I smiled back,
trying to be friendly. Office politics on day one was the last thing I needed.

Leo paused a few steps ahead, looking back impatiently."Ms. Taylor,did you join Stark Group to stand around? Is that the impression you want to give your supervisor on your first day?"
"Coming!" I called, hurrying to catch up. Once I fellin step beside him,I voiced the concern that had been nagging at me. "Director Schmidt,I just started at Stark Group today. I'm still a newcomer. Aren't you worried about what people might say if you take me out on my first day?"

Leo paused at the elevator, pressing the down button before turning to me with a critical look. "Don't forget why you came to Stark Group. You're here to work-for yourself and for the company-not to worry about what your colleagues think of you!"

His words hit home, and I straightened my posture. "You're right.I understand."

Inside. I worried that I'd already made my first enemy in Heather Bell.*Great job. Summer. First day and already causing workplace drama.*

The elevator whisked us down to the underground parking garage, where Leo led me to a sleek black sedan. Once we were both settled in, he started the engine.

"We're heading to the site," he explained, navigating out of the garage. "It's a rather isolated area. If you'd prefer not to go, now's the time to say so."

My interest piqued immediately. "Manhattan West Sidte? I'd love to go!"Then,trying to sound more professional, I added, "I appreciate the opportunity to learn about such an important project."

Leo glanced at me. "We're still in the assessment phase. Nothing's finalized yet."

As we drove, I pulled out my phone and researched the area. "There's a psychiatric hospital and rehab center there, right?"

Leo nodded, focused on driving.
I scrolled through more information. "The psychiatric hospital was relocated from downtown decades ago-that could make further displacement politically sensitive. And the rehab center carries its own stigma, affecting property values."

I continued analyzing. "Plus there's the river and those abandoned factories with contamination issues. We'd need to overcome environmental problems. public perception, and construction challenges. Definitely not an easy transformation."

A faint smile touched Leo's lips. "You're quite sharp,aren't you?"


I felt a smnall glow of pride at his compliment.

"Yes, these are all factors we need to consider," he confirmed. "That's why I'm going back for another on-site inspection. Sometimes numbers and reports don't tell the whole story. You need to see a place with your own eyes to truly understand its potential."

By midday, we reached a gas station on the outskirts of West Side. While Leo refueled, I stretched my legs and looked around.

The area was eerily quiet-nothing like the Manhattan I knew. The gas station looked worn down, with faded signs and cracked concrete.I chatted with the attendant, who seemed surprised to see someone in business clothes.

When I returned, Leo was leaning against the car with an unlit cigarette that he quickly tucked away when he saw me.

"What did you see?" he asked.

"Almost no activity," I reported. "The attendant says they just get pass-through traffic and vehicles from the rehab center. No local residents."
I thought aloud, "When developing this area, we need to consider people flow. A shopping center needs foot traffic. Medical facilities might make more sense given what's already here, but that requires specialized infrastructure..."

Leo nodded. "Good observations. Let's continue."

When we reached our destination. Leo parked under a large tree. The area was exactly as desolate as I'd imagined-abandoned buildings with broken windows. overgrown lots, crumbling infrastructure.

"Next time, come better prepared," Leo advised, eyeing my heels as we got out. "The terrain here isn't kind to fancy footwear."

I looked down at my shoes with regret. They were stylish but definitely not made for exploring urban decay.

Leo shook his head. "In this business, we face unexpected situations daily.No one gives you time to prepare. We need to anticipate every possibility."

He looked out at the landscape. "After all, opportunity favors the prepared mind."

I nodded seriously. "Yes, Director Schmidt."

Leo's expression softened. "Just call me Leo."

"Oh,I couldn't!" I protested, feeling awkward about addressing my boss by his first name on day one. "That feels too informal, Director Schmidt."

"Drop the 'Director Schmidt," he insisted. "It's just Leo. I don't stand on ceremony with people I work closely with."

After a moment's hesitation, I nodded. "Okay... Leo."
For the rest of the afternoon, we explored the desolate landscape of the West Side district. Leo explained his vision for the area while I took notes,ignoring the pain in my feet as my heels dug into broken concrete and uneven ground.

By sunset, my feet were throbbing painfully with blisters forming, but I focused on Leo's explanations, determined to prove myself.

"That's enough for today," Leo finally announced, noticing my unsteady stance. His eyes briefly flicked to my damaged feet, but he made no comment.

He simply nodded with satisfaction. "Let's head back."

In the car,Leo handed me a bottle of water.

"Poor planning on my part," he admitted. "I should have warned you about the terrain. Sorry about your feet."

I took a grateful sip, rubbing my foot. "Thanks for bringing me. I learned way more than I would have from just reading files."

When we returned to Stark Tower, most employees were leaving. I organized my notes for a few minutes, then decided to call it a day. My feet were killing me, and all I wanted was a warm foot soak.

I took the elevator to the parking garage and approached the red Porsche.As I slid behind the wheel, something felt different about the car.

I turned around and nearly jumped out of my skin.

Brandon sat in the back seat, files open on his lap, looking as perfectly composed as ever.
"Jesus Christ!" I gasped, one hand flying to my chest. "You scared the hell out of me! What are you doing here? Don't you have your own car?"

Brandon calmly closed the file he'd been reading, dark eyes trained on my face. "Finished work for the day?"

"Yeah," I nodded, still catching my breath. "Leo took me to the Manhattan
West Side district today. Can you believe it? On my first day!"


"Leo? You're on a first-name basis with him already?"
###Chapter 140: Jealous Again

**Summer's POV**

I bit back a smile. "Are you seriously getting jealous again right now?"

Brandon snapped the file shut. "You seem awfully pleased with yourself."

"I'm not!" I protested, my shoulders shaking with suppressed laughter.

I shifted in my seat, accidentally kicking the car door. Pain shot through my ankle, and I winced involuntarily.

Brandon's demeanor changed instantly. "What's wrong? Did you hurt yourself?"

"It's nothing," I said quickly.

Before I could stop him, Brandon was already out of the car, circling to my side. He pulled open my door and crouched down,carefully removing my heel to reveal angry red blisters and raw skin.

"Does it hurt?" he asked, his voice deceptively soft.

"No, not at all," I lied. "It's already feeling better."

Brandon deliberately pressed his thumb against my swollen ankle.

I yelped,jerking my foot away."Hey!"

"Doesn't hurt, huh?" His eyebrow arched in challenge. "What possessed you to wear these ridiculous heels for a site visit?"

"I didn't know we were going to a site!" I protested. "It was my first day!How was I supposed to know Leo would drag me out to Manhattan West
Side?"
Brandon's jaw tightened at the mention of Leo's name. "And Schmidt saw you were injured and did nothing?"

"It's not his fault," I defended. "I should have been better prepared."

"You went to a construction zone wearing these?" Brandon held up my stiletto. "What were you thinking?"

"I told you-I didn't know! What was I supposed to do? Say no to my boss on day one?"

"And your solution was to just suffer through it?"

"I'm sorry," I softened my tone. "I promise I'll be more careful next time."


"Next time?" Brandon's voice rose slightly.

"I just meant if there's ever another unexpected site visit, I'll make sure I have proper shoes."

Brandon shook his head. "You're in no condition to drive. Move to the passenger seat."

Before I could argue, he scooped me up in his arms. I wrapped my arms around his neck as he carried me to the passenger side.

I couldn't help smiling at his overprotective behavior.

"What's so funny?" Brandon demanded.

"Nothing. It's just... you can be so fussy sometimes. Worse than Grandpa George and Grandpa Jonathan combined! Like a grumpy old man!"
His eyebrows shot up in offense.

"My grumpy old man," I quickly added, kissing his cheek. "You shouldn't frown so much. Your face will get stuck that way, and then you'll be all wrinkled before your time." I ran a finger along his forehead. "And then you'll be too old for me!"

"June!" Brandon warned, pretending to loosen his grip.

I tightened my arms around his neck with a squeal. "Don't you dare drop me!"

He placed me carefully in the passenger seat before taking the driver's side.

"What do you want for dinner?" he asked as we pulled out of the parking garage.

"Steak!" I exclaimed. "With mashed potatoes and that amazing red wine sauce you make! Can we?"

A small smile tugged at his mouth. "Fine, but we'll need to pick up ingredients."

After a few minutes, Brandon spoke again. "So how was your first day?Did you learn anything useful?"

"Yeah! Actually, Leo was really helpful," I began enthusiastically. "He took me straight to the West Side project site instead of having me just read files all day. He said-"

"Don't mention other men when you're with me," Brandon interrupted. "Even if he's your boss. And stop calling him Leo."

I blinked in surprise before bursting into laughter. "Oh my God,Brandon!
You're adorable. I've never seen this side of you before!"

"I'm serious," he insisted. "It's inappropriate,"

"You're the one who asked about my day!" I pointed out. "What did you expect me to talk about?"

"We're changing the subject," he declared firmly.

I frowned, noticing we weren't on our usual route. "Brandon, this isn't the way to the Hamptons."

He glanced at me briefly. "Who said we were going home?"

Exhaustion suddenly washed over me. I felt my head nodding forward as my eyelids grew heavy.

The next thing I knew, Brandon's hand was gently cradling my head.I blinked groggily. "Huh? Are we home? No, wait... Did I fall asleep?"

"Stay put. I'm going to get something from the pharmacy. Don't move."

I nodded sleepily, watching him enter a drugstore. Before I knew it,my eyes had drifted shut again.




I woke up in our bedroom, confused about how I'd gotten there. My injured foot had been carefully bandaged, the pain reduced to a dull ache.Brandon must have carried me inside and treated my injuries while I slept.

After changing clothes and fixing my hair, I headed downstairs,following the unmistakable aroma of steak.

Brandon emerged from the kitchen wearing an apron.
"Come here," he called when he spotted me.

I started toward him eagerly.

"Slow down!" he scolded. "Your foot's still injured."

I obediently slowed my steps, sliding my arm through his. "Brandon, it smells amazing."

"Hungry? Go wash your hands. Dinner's ready."

"Why didn't you wake me up when we got home?" I asked, returning from the bathroom.

"You needed rest," he said simply.

I gaped at the spread before us-perfectly seared steaks, creamy mashed potatoes, roasted vegetabes, and a boat of rich red wine sauce that smelled heavenly.

"This is way too much food for just the two of us!"

"James arranged it. He might have gone overboard."

Just as we were about to sit down, the doorbell rang.

"Who could that be at this hour?"

Brandon said, "I'll get the door."

I heard voices in the hallway. A moment later, Dr. Sean Sullivan appeared in the doorway, grinning broadly.

"Surprise!" he announced, arms spread wide.

Brandon stood behind him, looking distinctly displeased. "What are you
doing here?"

"Come on, Brandon," Sean complained dramatically. "Is that any way to greet your friend? After everything we've been through?"

Before Brandon could respond, something large and black burst past Sean's legs. A massive German Shepherd bounded straight toward me,its tongue lolling out excitedly.

"Oh my God!" I shrieked, jumping up as the dog charged in my direction.

"Max! Heel!" Sean called halfheartedly, but the dog was too fixated on me.

I backed away, my injured foot forgotten as the enormous dog cornered me against the kitchen island, its massive paws hitting my shoulders as it tried to lick my face.

"Brandon!" I yelped, feeling utterly scared.
###Chapter 141:How Enviable

**Brandon's POV**

"Brandon!" June's voice rose several octaves, eyes wide with fear.

I moved instantly, pulling her into my arms and positioning myself between her and the overeager canine.

"Sit down,Max!"

Max immediately backed up at my sharp glare, sitting on his haunches with a pitiful whine, head tilted in confusion.

"It's okay." I murmured against June's hair, rubbing soothing circles on her back. "He won't hurt you. You're safe."

Her body trembled against mine, fingers clutching my shirt. Max let out another plaintive whine, ears drooping as he stared up at June.

"Sorry," June whispered as her breathing steadied. "I might have overreacted. It's just that he looked like he was going to jump on me, and I panicked."

"No need to apologize. Max can be intimidating if youI're not used to him."

She blinked, looking at Max more carefully."Yeah."

June's expression shifted from fear to determination. She slowly pulled away from me and carefully lowered herself to a crouch, extending her hand toward Max.

"Hey there, boy. Sorry about that. I didn't mean to freak out on you."

Max perked up but remained seated. At my slight nod, he approached
slowly, extending his paw against her palm like a peace offering.

A smile broke across June's face. "Well, aren't you a gentleman?" She reached out to stroke his head, and Max leaned into her touch.

Max circled June happily, nudging her hand for more pets.

"See? I'm not afraid anymore," she declared proudly, glancing up at me.

I couldn't help smiling. "Very brave, June."

A pointed cough remninded us we weren't alone. Sean stood leaning against the wall, arms crossed, an amused expression on his face.

"Dr. Sean! I almost forgot you were here," June said, startled.

"Naturally." Sean replied with a dramatic sigh. "I've just been standing here,watching this touching reunion."

"What do you want, Sean?" I asked bluntly.

He sniffed the air appreciatively, eyes drifting toward our dinner. "Mrs.Stark., I hope my unexpected arrival with Max didn't disrupt your evening too much."

"You know damn well it did," I muttered. "What are you really doing here?



Sean's gaze locked onto our dinner table. "Something smells absolutely divine."

"I should go get another place setting," June offered.

I placed a hand on her shoulder. "Don't bother. He isn't staying."
Sean was already heading toward the kitchen. "Don't mind your husband's terrible manners, Mrs. Stark." He retrieved not only a plate for himself but also a dog bowl.

"Don't even think about it," I warned. "Max is not eating at the table."

Max's ears drooped dramatically, eyes going wide and pleading as he looked from the bowl to June.

"Oh. Brandon, look at him," June said, melting under the dog's manipulation. "He looks so sad."

"He's playing you," I informed her flatly. "Sean taught him that look specifically."

"I'm sorry, sweetie," she said to Max. "You go wait in the living room,and I'll bring you something when we're done,okay?"

To my surprise, Max immediately trotted off to the living room,settling on the rug with remarkable obedience.

"Well, well," Sean remarked. "Looks like Max has a new favorite person."


"Let's eat," June declared. "I'm starving."

As we settled at the table, Sean continued his commentary. "Mrs. Stark,Max really seems to have taken a shine to you."

I shot him a warning glare, which he ignored.

"Then again," he continued, "animals have excellent judgment about people,"

"Are you done?" I asked coldly.
Sean grinned. "My, my, someone's touchy tonight. Marriage has certainly amped up your jealousy levels."

June touched my arm gently. "Brandon, eat your food before it gets cold."

My anger dissipated at her touch. "You too," I replied, my voice softening."You've had a long day."

Sean made a gagging noise. "Wow. How enviable."

After dinner, I led Sean to my study while June cleared the table despite my objections.

"Domestic life agrees with you," Sean began, dropping into one of my chairs. "Never thought I'd see the day Brandon Stark would be playing house."

"I'd be more content if you hadn't interrupted my evening."

"The others would have a heart attack if they saw you now. The fearsome Brandon Stark, tamed by marriage."

"Cut the crap, Sean. Why are you really here?"

He sobered immediately. "Actually, I do have news. My cousin Michael asked me to pass along a message-there's movement down in Mexico. He figured you should know."

I opened my desk drawer, pulling out a cigar case. "Michael doesn't do favors without reason."

"He's grateful, believe it or not. He appreciates that you married Summer."


I offered him a cigar, which he waved away.
"Quit," he explained.

"Anything else I should know about Mexico?"

"Just watch your back. Michael thinks they might try to hit you or Edward next."

"Tell Edward to stay alert," I instructed. "You too."

Sean nodded, then added, "By the way, I heard you're eyeing that Manhattan West Side development?"

"Your grapevine being Michael?"

"Apparently Fortune Corp wants a piece of the action. Word is, Richard Taylor's been cozying up to your grandfather, trying to leverage some old favor."

A cold smile worked its way onto my face. "Let them try. If they want to play this game, I'm more than willing to indulge them. But they'll need to prove they can handle what they're asking for."

"Sounds like things are about to get interesting," Sean remarked,rising."Well, it's getting late. I should head out."

He paused at the door, grinning. "Oh, before I forget-I need to leave Max with you for a while."

"Again?" I stared at him incredulously.

"Just for a week or two! He seems to really like Summer, and I'll be pulling doubles at the hospital."

"Sean," I growled, "are you trying to get yourself killed?"
He backpedaled toward the door. "I promise he's no trouble at all."

I pinched the bridge of my nose. "Dog food. Credit card. Now."

"You're the best, Brandon," Sean replied cheerfully, pulling out his wallet.

After Sean finally left, I found June curled up in the armchair by our bedroom window, carefully applying nail polish to her toenails. Her brow was furrowed in concentration, her lower lip caught between her teeth as she meticulously brushed the deep red color onto each nail.

I watched her for a moment, struck by how completely she'd transformed my life-my house, my routine, even my relationships.

"Here, let me," I said, taking the small bottle from her hand.

She looked up. "Brandon, what are you doing?"

I gently lifted her foot, placing it on my lap as I sat across from her."What does it look like? I'm painting your toenails."
###Chapter 142: He Paints My Toenails

**Summer's POV**

I couldn't help giggling as I watched Brandon examining the bottle of nail polish. He held my ankle gently in one hand, the tiny brush poised over my toes with surgical precision.

"Is this how you do it?" he asked, his brow furrowed as he studied the deep red polish.

I bit my lip to stop another laugh from bubbling up. Brandon Stark, Wall Street's most feared financial titan, was about to paint my toenails.

"What's so funny?" he asked, catching me staring at him.

"Nothing! Just... you can follow the example of this foot," I said,wiggling the toes of my other foot that I'd already painted. "And be careful not to get it on the skin! Are you really going to do this?"

Brandon shot me a look that was half amusement, half exasperation. "Didn't I say I would?"

I felt my cheeks flush as he gently positioned my foot on his lap.His fingers were warm against my skin as he steadied my foot, his touch feather-light yet firm.

As he began applying the polish with surprising dexterity, I found myself studying his face. His skin was flawless up close. His dark lashes cast faint shadows on his cheeks as he concentrated, and a small bead of sweat formed on his forehead.

Without thinking, I leaned forward with a tissue to dab at his forehead.The sudden movement made me wobble precariously on the edge of the
armchair.

"Sit still!" Brandon commanded, his free hand instantly flying to my waist to steady me.

"I was just trying to wipe your sweat!" I protested, still clutching the tissue.

Max chose that moment to circle us, his tail wagging enthusiastically as he nudged at Brandon's elbow.

"Quiet," Brandon murmured, not taking his eyes off his careful work.

I glanced between the television and Brandon, noticing the intense concentration on his face. "Brandon, I can finish it myself."

"It's fine," he replied, his focus unwavering. "Just sit still. Watch TV if you want."

"Brandon,what's wrong?" I asked, noticing his sudden pause.

"Nothing," he said tersely. "Watch your show.Max..."

At his call, Max trotted over, circling us with his tail wagging wildly.I reached down to scratch behind his ears, and he immediately leaned into my touch, rubbing against my leg with obvious affection.

Brandon shot the dog a warning look that made me laugh out loud.

"Why are you scaring him?" I chided, beckoning to the German Shepherd."Max,come here!"

Max obeyed instantly, trotting to my side. I grabbed his favorite toy from the coffee table and gave it a toss across the room, watching him bound after it with puppyish enthusiasm.
"Brandon," I said,turning back to him with a teasing smile, "what do you think would happen if word got out that the great Brandon Stark spends his evenings painting his wife's toenails? Would Wall Street ever recover from the shock?"

He didn't look up from his task, but I caught the slight quirk of his lips."Is there something strange about me painting yourtoenails? Women's desire to look beautiful is natural." His tone turned slightly serious. "Though these chemicals aren't good for your health. You shouldn't use them too often."

"I know, I know!" I assured him. "I don't use it much, honestly. Ruby gave me these as a gift, and I figured I might as well use them. Once in a while doesn't hurt!"

Brandon finished one foot with surprising skill, setting it carefully on a towel he'd laid across the coffee table. I wiggled my newly painted toes admiringly.

"Brandon, you're good at everything, aren't you? First try and they look perfect! When I first tried painting my own toes, I got more polish on my skin than my nails. Ruby and Scarlett laughed at me for days!"

He picked up my other foot, his hands warm and steady. "Is that so? Next time I'll do them for you, and you can show your friends."

"They'd absolutely kill me!" I exclaimed, then added softly,"You look really handsome when you're concentrating like that."

Brandon's eyes flicked up to mine, amusement dancing in their dark depths. "So I only look good when I'm concentrating? Is that what you're saying?"
I felt my face flush again. "Oh my god, you're impossible! You should just say 'thank you!"

"Whatever," I mumbled, trying to hide my smile. "Just hurry up with that foot. You're distracting me from my show!"

As Brandon focused on finishing my other foot, Max suddenly became agitated, circling us with increasing enthusiasm, his nails clicking on the hardwood floor.

"What's wrong with him?" I asked, eyeing the dog's strange behavior.

Brandon glanced up with a deadpan expression. "I believe it's... rutting season for Max."

I burst out laughing at his ridiculous explanation, my foot jerking slightly in his grasp.

\---

The next morning, I woke to find myself nestled in Brandon's arms.Bright sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow across our bedroom. Brandon's face was relaxed in sleep, all the sharp edges and intensity softened.

I couldn't resist-I reached up and gently pinched his cheek, feeling the smooth skin between my fingers. His face looked younger, almost boyish in repose.

Just as I was about to pinch his other cheek, Brandon's hand shot up and captured my wrist. His eyes remained closed, but a smile played at the corners of his mouth.

"And what exactly are you doing, Mrs. Stark?" he murmured, voice husky
with sleep.

"I-nothing!" I stammered, trying to free my hand. "Let go!"

Instead of releasing me. Brandon pulled me closer, wrapping his arms around me in a warm cocoon. "It's still early," he said, burying his face in my hair. "Let's sleep a little longer."

"It's not early at all!" I protested, squirming in his grasp. "I have work today! This is technically my first real day, and I don't want to make a bad impression on Leo. Brandon, come on!"

When he didn't respond, I wiggled harder. "Brandon! Get up!"

"This is your fault," he grumbled, finally loosening his grip. "You woke me up with your pinching."

"This is not my fault! Let me go!" I pushed against his chest, finally breaking free. One glance at the clock sent me into panic mode. "Oh my god, we're going to be late!"

Brandon sat up, running a hand through his tousled hair. "Alright, go get ready."

I sprinted to the bathroom, frantically brushing my teeth while trying to decide what to wear.

I raced through my morning routine, nearly tripping as I pulled on my clothes. "This is a disaster," I muttered, frantically searching for my phone."First real day and I'm going to be late!"

Brandon appeared in the doorway, already dressed in a crisp suit.

"Relax," he said, handing me my phone. "You won't be late."
--00
"If I am, I'm deducting it from your paycheck," I threatened, shoving my feet into sensible flats.

"Deal," he agreed easily.

As I rushed toward the garage, Brandon fell into step beside me. "I'll ride with you today."

I stopped short. "What? Don't you have your own car?"

"I do, but..." he shrugged, the picture of innocence, "they haven't been driven in a while. Some might be rusty. Others might be out of gas."

I stared at him in disbelief. Brandon Stark, with his collection of luxury cars worth millions sitting in our garage, was claiming they might be *rusty*?And out of *gas*?

But the clock was ticking, and I didn't have time to argue. "Fine," I said.shooting him a look that promised this wasn't over.
###Chapter 143:Boyfriend?

**Summer's POV**

The sleek sports car sliced through early morning traffic with surprising ease. I clutched my bag tightly, stealing glances at the dashboard clock every few seconds.

"Would you relax?" Brandon said, his hands casually resting on the steering wheel. "I told you that you won't be late."

"Easy for you to say," I muttered. "You're the boss. I'm the new girl who can't afford to make a bad impression on day two."

That's when I finally paid attention to how we were cutting through traffic like it was standing still, Brandon's hands moving with precision as he navigated between cars with an almost supernatural awareness.

I suddenly understood what he'd meant earlier. With Brandon behind the wheel, time and space seemed to bend to his will.

As we approached the final intersection before Stark Tower. I checked the time again. Fifteen minutes to spare. But as we got closer, panic suddenly gripped me.

"Stop the car," I said suddenly.

Brandon threw me a confused look."What?"

"Pull over. Right now." I glanced nervously at the looming tower ahead.

He complied, smoothly guiding the car to the curb a block from Stark Tower.
"You need to get out," I said, already unbuckling my seatbelt. "I can't show up with you! People will notice. They'll talk."

Brandon stared at me for a long moment, then chuckled. "You're kicking me out of the car?"

"Yes! Now hurry up before someone sees us!"

With exaggerated slowness, Brandon opened his door and stepped out onto the sidewalk. Through the window, I could see him standing there,hands in his pockets, an amused smirk playing on his lips as I pulled away from the curb.

By the time I reached the Projects Division, I was practically jogging down the hallway, my injured foot protesting with each step.

I made it to my desk with seconds to spare, dropping into my chair just as Leo Schmidt emerged from his office.

"Director Schmidt!" I greeted, straightening the items on my desk.

Leo gave me a once-over, his expression unimpressed. "You're late."


My jaw dropped. "I'm not late! It's exactly nine o'clock!"

He cut me off with a sharp gesture. "In the Projects Dvision, we expect everyone to arrive at least ten minutes early. You wouldn't know since it's your second day, but now you do. Don't make this mistake again."

I blinked, caught completely off guard. "Yes, Director Schmidt."

"I don't care who you are or what traffic problems you encountered,"he continued sternly. "This is a workplace with rules. No excuses. Understood?11
I nodded,swallowing my protest. "I understand. I'll be earlier tomorrow."

Leo's expression softened marginally. "Good. Now come with me."

Inside his office, Leo gestured to a large stack of folders on his desk."These are for you. Review them today."

I approached the desk, eyeing the towering pile. "Are these all your previous projects?"

He nodded. "Most have faced similar challenges. Read through them first."

"Wait," I said, the implication suddenly hitting me. "Are you saying you want me to join this project?"

Leo raised an eyebrow. "Is that a problem?"

"It's just... I just started here. I've barely worked on projects of this scale before."

"Not having you lead it," he clarified. "Having you participate. Unless you're not interested?"

"No! I mean yes! I'm definitely interested!" The words tumbled out of me.

Leo's expression remained neutral, but I detected a hint of approval. "This project is a priority for the company. It requires a team. Your performance yesterday showed promise. Your ideas may lack refinement, but you're patient and attentive to detail."

Warmth bloomed in my chest at his assessment. "Thank you! I'll try my best,I promise."

"Good." He gestured toward the door. "Now get started."
I made my way back to my desk, arms straining under the weight of the folders. As I rounded the corner, I nearly collided with Heather Bell, who was carrying a steaming cup of coffee.

"Sorry!" I exclaimed, stepping back just in time.

Heather's eyes immediately zeroed in on the stack of folders in my arms.Her expression shifted subtly-a flash of what looked like jealousy before she composed herself.

Once seated, I began sifting through the materials. My eyes widened as I realized what I was looking at-these weren't just any project files,but detailed records of Leo's personal achievements. This was practically a goldmine.

I was so absorbed in my reading that I almost missed my phone vibrating.James's name flashed on the screen.

"Hello?" I answered quietly.

"Mrs. Stark," James's voice came through. "It's James."

I glanced around quickly. "James, do you need something?"

"Could you possibly step outside? I'm right outside."

I slipped out to the hallway where James was waiting, holding a paper bag that smelled deliciously of fresh pastries.

"Mrs. Stark, Mr. Stark asked me to bring you breakfast." He held out the bag with a formal little bow.

I shook my head, "James, I've told you to call me Summer at work. And there are rules against eating at our desks. You should take this back."
James's expression crumpled into one of genuine distress. "Miss Taylor,you're putting me in an impossible position. Mr. Stark specifically ordered me to buy you breakfast. He even threatened my bonus. Could you please...


"Stop!" I held up a hand, a headache already forming. "Look, if I take that breakfast in there now, Director Schmidt will definitely see it. Then I'll be in trouble on my second day."

"What should we do, then?" He looked genuinely torn.

"You eat it." I said decisively, already turning to leave. "I need to get back to work!"

Back at my desk, I had barely settled in when Heather sidled up with an expression of barely contained curiosity.

"So, Summer," she began, leaning in conspiratorially, "what's really going on between you and James? Are you two dating?"

I raised an eyebrow."No."

"Come on," she pressed. "You can téll me. Why else would he personally escort you on your first day and then bring you breakfast today? James must be your boyfriend,right?"
I kept my expression neutral. "We're not dating. We're just relatives. My family knows he works at Stark Group and asked him to look out for me.But I got this job on my own merits."

Heather's eyes narrowed skeptically."Is that so?"

"Don't you two have work to do?" Leo's voice made us both jump. He stood a few feet away, looking thoroughly unimpressed.
"Get back to your desks.Now."

The rest of the day passed in a productive blur. I found myself genuinely impressed with Stark Group's work environment-everything ran with precision and purpose, a stark contrast to the chaotic atmosphere at Fortune Corp. By the end of the day, I had carefully packed up Leo's materials to take home for further study.

As I was preparing to leave, my phone rang. Brandon.

"Done for the day?" he asked when I picked up.

"Mmm-hmm," I confirmed, already smiling at the sound of his voice.

"Let's meet in the parking garage. We'll go out for dinner and catch a movie afterward."

My mood immediately brightened. "Sounds perfect! I'll head down now."

As I ended the call, I noticed Heather passing by my desk. She'd clearly overheard my side of the conversation, and the change in my tone hadn't escaped her notice.

"Boyfriend?" she asked, eyebrows raised suggestively.
###Chapter 144: What The Hell Are You Doing
Summer's POV
I dropped my smile. "A friend."
Heather's lips curled into a smirk. "Come on, Summer. Don't be like that. We're colleagues! I'm just trying to get to know you better. No need to be so secretive." The cheerful tone didn't match the calculating look in her eyes.
"Heather," I said, my voice cooling several degrees, "you're right that we're colleagues. And that's exactly why my personal life isn't something I need to share. I'd be happy to discuss work-related matters with you anytime."
Other employees were starting to notice, but Heather raised her voice. "I'm just trying to be friendly! You've only been here two days. There's no need to be so guarded." The implication was clear—she was suggesting I had gotten my position through influence. It was a calculated attack on my professional credibility.
I frowned, gathering my belongings. "I came to Stark Group to do a job. I have somewhere to be." As I walked away, I saw Leo standing behind Heather, his expression distinctly displeased. Clearly, he'd overheard her unprofessional behavior.
The garage was quiet when I arrived. Brandon was leaning against his car, looking up as I approached. "Sorry to keep you waiting," I called.
"You're right on time," he replied, taking my bag. As we settled into the car, he studied my face. "Where are we eating?"
"James mentioned a new steak place in Manhattan," Brandon replied, starting the engine. My mood instantly brightened. Just then, Brandon's phone rang—it was James. I noticed Brandon's expression darken slightly during the call, but he just turned to me afterward with that intense look.
"Did something happen at work today?" he asked as he leaned over to secure my seatbelt, his breath warm on my cheek.
"It was nothing," I insisted. "Just a minor thing with a coworker. I can handle it."
"You know you can tell me if there's a problem," he said. I patted his arm, assuring him I was fine. We enjoyed a quiet, expensive steak dinner before heading to the theater.
The movie theater was just around the corner. Brandon guided us to premium seats near the back—private enough, but still surrounded by the whispers of younger couples. He passed me a box of popcorn, which I set in the holder. "I'm still stuffed from dinner," I sighed.
The lights dimmed, and the theater hushed into a cocoon of shadows. I tried to focus on the romance on screen, but Brandon's presence was a massive distraction. I didn't notice at first when his hand settled on my thigh under the jacket he'd draped over my lap. I thought it was just a comforting weight, until his fingers began to move.
Slow, deliberate circles traced over my skirt, inching higher with every pass. My breath caught as his hand moved with a firm, unyielding touch that sent a jolt of electricity through me.
"Brandon," I hissed under my breath, my voice a shaky whisper. "What the hell are you doing?"

###Chapter 145 Don't Make a Sound

Summer's POV
"Shh," he murmured, his voice a low, commanding vibration near my ear. "Not a sound, June. Just focus on the movie."
My heart slammed against my ribs as his presence felt more insistent under the cover of the jacket. The air in the theater grew thin, replaced by a searing, magnetic energy that made my head spin. Every nerve in my body was hyper-tuned to the subtle movements beneath the fabric. It was a reckless, exhilarating kind of tension—being so close to him in a room full of people, sharing an unspoken secret that no one else could perceive.
Brandon didn't rush. He was slow and calculated, a silent challenge that demanded my complete focus. I gripped the armrests until my knuckles turned white, fighting to keep my breathing steady as the anticipation coiled tighter and tighter within me. The thrill of our shared secret mixed with the raw magnetism he always exerted over me, creating a storm of emotion that left me breathless.
"Brandon—please," I whispered, the words barely audible, my voice breaking. I was caught between the urge to pull away and the desire to stay lost in this moment. But he didn't look at me; he stared straight ahead at the screen, his expression calm and composed, even as the intensity between us reached a fever pitch.
The world outside the sanctuary of his jacket ceased to exist. As the film reached its emotional climax, I felt an overwhelming wave of connection crash over me—a deep, rhythmic pulse of shared fire that left me trembling. I bit my lip hard to remain silent, my body quaking slightly as the overwhelming tension finally broke, leaving me spent and breathless in the cool darkness of the theater.
Finally, the movements ceased, and his hand came to rest possessively over mine. He leaned in close, his breath warm against my skin. "You're perfect for me, June," he whispered, his voice thick with a dark, quiet satisfaction.
I couldn't answer. The exhaustion from the emotional roller coaster and the aftershocks of that intense connection pulled me under. My head nodded forward, and the next thing I knew, Brandon's arm was steadying me, offering his shoulder as a pillow.
"Tired? Go ahead and sleep," he murmured gently.
When the movie ended, I felt weightless. I woke to find Brandon carrying me through the thinning theater crowd toward the exit. I was mortified to realize I'd fallen asleep in his arms in such a public place.
"Is the movie over?" I croaked, my cheeks burning as I saw people staring and whispering about how "attentive" he was.
"Almost," he said, his tone even and unshaken. He set me on my feet in the corridor once we were away from the main crowd, but then he crouched in front of me, his broad back turned.
"June, climb on."
"What? No!" I hissed, embarrassment flooding me again. "I'm fine! I can walk!"
"June," he said firmly, his voice leaving no room for argument. "Get on. You need the rest." Reluctantly, I leaned against his back, wrapping my arms around his neck, and let him carry me out into the cool night air, the lingering heat of our secret encounter still glowing quietly within me.
###Chapter 146: Secrets

**Summer's POV**

Brandon carried me to the car after the movie, my legs still wobbly from what had happened in the theater. By the time we pulled into the Hamptons driveway, I was wide awake, the unexpected nap having reset my internal clock.

"I've got some work to catch up on," I told Brandon, slipping off my shoes.."I want to review those Manhattan West Side files Leo gave me."

Brandon raised an eyebrow. "At this hour?"

"I won't be able to sleep," I explained. "Do you mind if I use your study?"

"It's your study too," he reminded me, loosening his tie. "Go ahead."

An hour later, I was deep into Leo's files, cross-referencing data and making notes. The Manhattan West Side project was ambitious-exactly the kind of challenge I'd hoped for when joining Stark Group.

Max appeared in the doorway, his dark eyes fixed on me with that sad.pleading look dogs perfect from puppyhood.

"No, Max," Brandon said firmly from behind him. "Mom's working. Don't disturb her."

Max made a muffled "woof" sound-almost like he was arguing.


"I mean it," Brandon continued."Sit."

To my amazement, Max immediately sat, though his eyes kept darting between Brandon and me with obvious discontent.
I refocusedI on the files, making connections between Leo's previous projects and the challenges of Manhattan West Side. I was so absorbed that I didn't notice Brandon's presence until he appeared in the doorway,his hair damp from a shower, a towel draped around his neck.
"Your hair's still wet," I scolded, looking up. "You're going to catch a cold."

"Still working?" he asked, ignoring my comment. "You just started at the company. Is Leo already loading you up with assignments?"

I shook my head. "No, nothing like that. These are just materials he gave me to study. I don't want to fall behind on the Manhattan West Side project."

Brandon nodded, moving behind my chair. His hands came to rest on my shoulders, immediately finding the knots at the base of my neck.

"You don't have to do that," I said quickly. "I'm fine."

"Your shoulders are tight," he replied, his thumbs working with unerring accuracy. "Let me."

As the tension melted from my muscles, my mind cleared, and I found myself focusing on the project again.

"What do you think of what you've read so far?" Brandon asked.

"Leo is impressive," I began. "Look at the Parkview Plaza project from three years ago-his first after returning to New York. The site had serious environmental concerns with a river nearby. Residents were worried about pollution."

"How did he handle it?" Brandon's hands continued their work.
"He redesigned everything to work around the river, creating buildings that followed its natural course. He implemented strict environmental controls." I explained. "It's a case study in adapting to constraints rather than fighting them."

"And Manhattan West Side?"

"Even bigger challenges," I sighed. "Beyond the contamination from abandoned factories, there's the psychiatric hospital and rehab center to consider. You can't just relocate facilities like that." I flipped through my notes. "The geological surveys show potential issues too. Do you think the project might end up shelved?"

Brandon's fingers worked at a particularly stubborn knot. "What do you think?"

"I think it could become a major commercial hub eventually. But those institutional facilities are uncontrollable variables, and the pollution requires serious remediation."

Brandon's hands stilled. "Everything has a solution."

I hesitated before asking, "I heard Fortune Corp wants a piece of this project. Is that true?"

"Yes," he said simply.

"They're nowhere near capable of handling something this complex.When I was there, their operations were a mess. They depend completely on Stark Group to stay afloat." I thought for a moment. "I noticed Stark Group reduced their order volume recently. Fortune Corp immediately started having problems-not just with personnel but accounting irregularities too."
Brandon's expression remained neutral.

"That was your doing." I said. "Controlling the order flow."

His lips curved into a slight smile.

"It makes sense now," I continued. "Old Alexander Stark wanting Alexander to be with Victoria-he's after her shares in the Taylor family's Capital Corp. Now the order flow is normal again, I thought you would just cut it."

"He saved my uncle Gavin's daughter's life," Brandon said unexpectedly.

The apparent non sequitur threw me. "Your uncle Gavin?"

"My uncle also has an adopted daughter, Zoey Stark."

"I didn't know that," I said, surprised. "I only knew about Gavin being completely devoted to his wife."
Brandon's expression softened slightly. "And there is Alice Stark, my half-sister from my father, and Grace Stark, whose real name is Katniss Kennedy-my uncle Gavin's daughter and Edward Lee's wife."

My jaw nearly dropped. "What?"

"If you meet members of the Stark family," Brandon said, his tone serious,"those two you can trust. They're different from the others."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. "I never knew you had sisters! And wait-Edward Lee is married? How did I not know that?"

"These things aren't public knowledge," he replied. "It's a Stark family secret."
"And you're just casually telling me all this?" I asked, genuinely stunned.

Brandon's gaze was steady. "You're my wife, June. Why wouldn't I tell you?"

The simple statement sent warmth spreading through my chest. Despite everything-our unconventional start, the secrecy at work, the complications with our families-in this moment, I felt truly connected to him.

"Honestly, there are too many names to keep track of right now," I said with a small laugh. "Maybe let's save the full Stark family tree for when I actually meet them? My brain is already on overload."

"Thank you, though," I added softly, reaching up to touch his hand on my shoulder. "For trusting me."
Brandon leaned down, pressing a kiss to the top of my head. "It's late.Don't stay up too much longer."
###Chapter 147:Play Dumb

**Summer's POV**

In the blink of an eye, I'd been working at Stark Group for almost two weeks now. During this time, I'd learned so much from Leo Schmidt. He was a man with remarkable ideas and insights. At first, I found him difficult to deal with and thought he was extremely strict, but after spending time working together, I realized he was actually a decent person-at least he'd been good to me.

That afternoon, I had just wrapped up my work when I received a call from Elizabeth. This caught me by surprise. Since Victoria's wedding, I hadn't heard a peep from the Taylor household. I'd almost begun to think they'd forgotten about my existence entirely.

"Hello, " I answered, stepping into the hallway for privacy.

"Summer," Elizabeth's voice cut through like a knife. "Meet me at Le Bernardin tonight at seven. Don't be late."

I pinched the bridge of my nose, feeling a headache forming. "Is there something specific-"

"Just be there," she interrupted. "You've been seeing that Sullivan boy for what,two weeks now? How are things progressing?"

I blinked,completely thrown. "What Sullivan boy? I haven't seen anyone."

"Don't play dumb with me," Elizabeth snapped. "Michael Sullivan! The one I introduced you to at Victoria's wedding."

"I haven't seen him since then," I replied, confused. "I've been busy."
Her laugh was sharp, dismissive. "Busy with what exactly? Victoría tells me you're not even at Fortune Corp anymore. What could possibly be keeping you so occupied when you don't have a job?"

The casual cruelty in her voice was so familiar it almost didn't sting anymore.
"Michael Sullivan is an exceptional catch," she continued. "If Victoria weren'
t already married, do you think I'd be offering someone like him to∗you∗?′′
"Then maybe you should introduce him to Victoria instead," I replied coolly.

"This arrangement with Michael Sullivan isn't up for negotiation,"she hissed. "Be at Le Bernardin at seven, dressed appropriately for once."

After she hung up, I immediately called Brandon.

"Hey," he answered, his voice instantly calming me. "What's up?"

"I don't think I can make dinner tonight," I explained. "My mother's demanding I meet her at Le Bernardin. She thinks I've been seeing Michael Sullivan these past two weeks and wants to check on our progress.'I think she's hoping to marry me off to the Sullivan family tree. Too bad
she doesn't realize it was Sean who showed up that day, not his cousin."

"I uanderstand," Brandon replied after a moment. "Go ahead."


"But I don't even know Michael Sullivan," I protested.

"Don't worry about it," he assured me. "You'll be fine."

Le Bernardin's elegant façade loomed before me at exactly 6:30 PM.I'd come straight from work, deliberately not changing out of my "drab" navy
pantsuit. If Elizabeth wanted to parade me in front of some society bachelor, she could take me as I was.
The maître d'led me to a secluded table where my mother sat nursing a martini, her expression souring the moment she spotted me.

"What in God's name are you wearing?" she demanded.


"Clothes," I replied simply.

Elizabeth's face contorted with disapproval. "I specifically told you to dress appropriately. Look at yourself-you look like some middle-aged accountant. No wonder Alexander left you for your sister."
I felt a flash of anger. "Oh, is that why? I always thought it had more to do with you and Dad pushing them together behind my back."
"Watch your mouth," she warned. "I'm trying to help you here. You have no job, no prospects-"

"Who told you I don't have a job?" I interrupted.

She waved her hand dismissively. "Victoria mentioned you'd left Fortune Corp. We both know you only got that position because of Alexander's connections. Now that bridge is burned, what exactly are you doing with yourself? This is why finding a suitable husband is so important."

"I wasn't fired from Fortune Corp-I quit," I clarified. "And I left because I found something better."

"Better?" she scoffed. "What could possibly be better than the position Alexander arranged for you?"

"I work at Stark Group now," I stated simply. "In the Projects Division."
Elizabeth froze mid-sip. "Stark Group? Brandon Stark s company?Alexander's uncle's business?"

I frowned, confused. "Ive been at Stark Group for weeks now, and I've never heard Brandon mention having a nephew. He has a little niece named Angela, but she's just a kid."
Elizabeth slammed her glass down. "Don't be ridiculous. Alexander is Brandon's nephew through the Stark family line. Why else would Victoria have gotten that contract with Stark Entertainment?"

"Maybe because she's marketable?" I suggested, unable to keep the edge from my voice. "Brandon's a businessman. He recognizes talent when he sees it."

"So that's what this dinner is really about?" she fumed. "You coming here to gloat about your fancy new job? After everything I've done for you-arranging this meeting with Michael Sullivan, trying to secure your future-this is how you repay me?"

"I didn't ask you to arrange anything," I pointed out. "And you're certainly not doing it out of concern for my happiness."

"I am your *mother*," she hissed, slapping her palm against the table. "Everything I do is for your benefit. Michael Sullivan is from an excellent family with wealth and connections. You should be thanking me on your knees."

"I'm not interested in meeting Michael Sullivan," I said, standing up. "And since he doesn't appear to be here yet, I think I'll leave now."
Elizabeth's hand shot out, gripping my wrist. "Sit. Down. When Michael gets here, you will be polite and grateful. If you can't do that much,don't
bother calling yourself my daughter anymore."

For years, that threat would have reduced me to immediate compliance.Tonight, it had lost its power. I had Brandon now. I had my grandfathers.Ruby and Scarlett, a career I was proud of.

"Mother," I said softly, "I think we both know you stopped seeing me as your daughter a long time ago. Victoria's always been your only real child."

With that. I walked away.

"Stop right there!" Elizabeth slammed her palm on the table, making the teacups rattle loudly as her chest heaved up and down.
###Chapter 148: Don't Mess This Up

**Summer's POV**

I'd barely taken two steps toward the exit when the private dining room's door swung open. Dr. Sean Sullivan appeared in the doorway, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit. His eyes sparkled with amusement as he surveyed the scene-me frozen mid-escape, my mother half-risen from her chair,face flushed with anger.

"Well," Sean drawled, one hand casually tucked into his pocket. "Isn't this Miss Taylor? Where are you rushing off to?"
I stared at him in shock, suddenly understanding Brandon's earlier calm when I'd mentioned this dinner. He must have arranged for Sean to show up pretending to be Michael Sullivan, Daisy Sullivan's son.
Elizabeth recovered instantly, her fury morphing into saccharine politeness."Michael! You're here!" She grabbed my arm, her fingernails digging painfully into my skin. "Summer was just so excited to see you that she was coming to greet you! Weren't you, dear?"

Sean raised an eyebrow skeptically. "Is that so?" His gaze locked with mine,and I could practically hear his unspoken laughter.

"Don't you dare mess this up," Elizabeth hissed through her frozen smile."Say hello to Michael right now."

Elizabeth's voice rose to its public-performance pitch. "Michael,just look at our Summer! She came specifically to see you tonight. Please, have a seat!"
She reached for Sean's arm, but he smoothly sidestepped her, turning to me instead.
"After you, Miss Taylor," he said with exaggerated courtesy.

"Please, Mr. Sullivan," I replied with an equally forced smile. "After you."

Elizabeth shot me a warning glare before turning to pour wine for Sean.

"Let me get that for you," Sean interjected before Elizabeth could finish.

Elizabeth thrust the wine bottle into my hands. "Summer, pour Michael some wine! You were just telling me how much you wanted to talk with him before he arrived, weren't you?"

I barely suppressed an eye roll as I poured Sean's wine and handed him the glass. "Here you go, Mr. Sullivan."
"Thank you," he replied, lightly brushing my fingers as he took the glass.He winked when Elizabeth wasn't looking.
I shot him a sideways glare that clearly said, *Don't you dare make this worse*.

Elizabeth settled into her chair before launching into her campaign."Summer's being so quiet! And here she's been talking about you constantly since Victoria's wedding.Always wondering when she might see you again!



"Really?" Sean's eyes danced with mischief.

"Oh yes," Elizabeth continued. "Michael, please don't mind her shyness.This daughter of mine-she's just too timid. At home, she mentions you all the time, always finding subtle ways to ask about you."
I maintained a neutral expression, refusing to acknowledge her ridiculous fabrications.
"Oh yeah?" Sean replied, clearly enjoying the absurdity of the situation.

"Well." Sean said, turning to me with theatrical seriousness, "I'm deeply honored to have caught Miss Taylor's attention. It's quite flattering!"

I nearly choked on my water. The thought of being romantically linked to Sean sent an involuntary shudder through me.

Elizabeth beamed triumphantly. "Oh, it's our Summer who should feel honored that you've taken notice of her! Isn't that right, Summer?"
She pinched my thigh under the table, leaning close to whisper harshly,"Talk to him. Tell him you like him."
That was the last straw. I stood abruptly. "Excuse me, I need to use the restroom."

"Summer!" Elizabeth called after me, but I ignored her,walking briskly toward the exit.

When I returned ten minutes later, I found the table laden with food.Apparently, they'd ordered without me.

"Miss Taylor," Sean said as I approached, "please, have a seat. We took the liberty of ordering. If anything isn't to your liking, we can order something else."

"This is fine," I replied,settling back.

"See?" Elizabeth jumped in. "Michael, didn't I tell you? Summer's tastes align perfectly with yours! You two are truly meant for each other!" She leaned forward conspiratorially. "Perhaps we should get both families together soon to discuss wedding arrangements?"
I nearly dropped my fork. Wedding arrangements? She had officially lost her mind.

Sean choked on his wine before breaking into genuine laughter. "Wedding?Mrs. Taylor, I think there might be some misunderstanding here."

Elizabeth's smile faItered. "Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding?Aren't you interested in marrying Summer? Your mother Daisy and I are very close friends, you know. She promised me this match. And I saw how well you two got along at Victoria's wedding!"
I gripped my fork so tightly my knuckles turned white. Every word out of her mouth made me want to sink further into my chair.

Sean's expression shifted, the playful gleam in his eyes replaced by something harder.

"I enjoy Miss Taylor's company," he said carefully."She's impressive-intelligent, beautiful, accomplished. Of course I find her appealing. But Mrs. Taylor, I'm afraid you've misunderstood. I don't recall my mother ever mentioning your friendship, and even if you are acquainted, she has no authority over my marriage choices-and neither do you."

Elizabeth's jaw dropped. "How-how dare you speak to me that way!"

"And I'm speaking with great restraint because you are Miss Taylor's mother," Sean replied, his voice growing colder. "I genuinely admire Miss Taylor and value her friendship. However, since I arrived,you've done nothing but criticize and belittle her. If she's so inadequate by your standards, why are you so eager to have me marry her?"

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. I'd never seen this side of Sean before-the carefree playboy replaced by someone
with a steel backbone.

Elizabeth sputtered incoherently, her face reddening."You- "

"Miss Taylor is exceptional," Sean continued. "I'm certain she has many worthy admirers. There's no need for you to concern yourself so heavily with her marital status. While I'd be happy to enjoy a casual meal with Miss Taylor sometime,I find I've lost my appetite for tonight's dinner."

I couldn't help the small smile that crept onto my face.Seeing my mother rendered speechless was a rare pleasure.

Sean turned to me. "Miss Taylor, I have some business to attend to.Are you heading home soon?"

"Yes," I replied, grateful for the escape route. "I háve work early tomorrow morning."

"May I offer you a ride?" he asked smoothly.

"Absolutely not," Elizabeth interjected, recovering her voice.

Sean raised an eyebrow. "Oh? Do you have some objection to my association with her now, Mrs. Taylor?"

Elizabeth's face contorted with barely controlled rage. "I need to speak with my daughter privately. If you're so busy, Michael, we won't keep you."

She gripped my wrist, keeping me firmly in my seat as Sean prepared to leave.

"Thank you for the offer, Mr. Sullivan," I said quickly,"but I drove here myself."

Sean nodded. "Very well, then. Good evening."
The moment Sean disappeared. Elizabeth's fingers dug painfully into my arm. "What is wrong with you?" she hissed. "You just sat there like a mute while Michael Sullivan disrespected me! I'm your mother!"

I met her gaze evenly. "What exactly did you want me to say? Should I have argued with him? Isn't your goal still to marry me off to him? If I antagonized him. wouldn't that ruin your plans? Think about it-insulting him means insulting the entire Sullivan family. Is Taylor Enterprises ready to lose such a powerful potential ally?"
###Chapter 149: Summer and the Taylor Fannly?

**Summer's POV**

"You little bich!" Elizabeth's voice echoed in the private dining room at Le Bernardin, her hand raised midair.

The door suddenly swung open, and Dr. Sean stood in the doorway,eyebrows raised as he took in the scene-Elizabeth with her hand still suspended in the air, me standing my ground with a cool expression.

"Whoa! What's going on here?" Sean's voice carried a mixture of surprise and amusement.

Elizabeth's hand froze mid-air, her expression shifting so rapidly it was almost comical-anger to shock to embarrassment, finally settling on a forced smile. I felt my lips curve into a slight smirk. Caught in the act.

"Mr. Sullivan," I turned toward him calmly. "You came back?"

Sean leaned against the doorframe, his eyes dancing with mischief. "Yeah.suddenly remembered something I wanted to discuss with Miss Taylor.Seems like I came at just the right time, though-quite the show I walked in on!"

Elizabeth's face went pale, her hand finally dropping to her side. "Mr.Sullivan, ha ha, what urgent business do you have with our Summer? I was just-"

"Mrs. Taylor," Sean cut her off, his voice suddenly cold, "I have eyes. I can see exactly what's going on here." His gaze swept between us. "I had no idea that Taylor family's second daughter held such a... *distinguished*
position at home."
Elizabeth flinched visibly, her social mask slipping back into place. "Of course not! Summer and I were just-"
"Mr. Sullivan," I interrupted, gathering my purse. "We should go."

Sean nodded, his eyes still fixed on Elizabeth. "Absolutely. I'll drive Miss Taylor home." He glanced at me. "Though I'm not sure if Miss Taylor is going to the Taylor family home or..."

"I have my own apartment," I replied smoothly, relishing the flash of humiliation on Elizabeth's face. "Thanks for the ride, Mr. Sullivan."
My response was a clear slap to Elizabeth's face, exposing the lie she'd told Sean earlier about how close we supposedly were. I walked past her without another glance and followed Sean out of the restaurant.
"I've gotta say, Summer, that mother of yours is something else!" Sean chuckledas we stepped outside Le Bernardin into the cool evening air.

"Mm," I mumbled noncommittally, unable to join in his amusement. No matter how dysfunctional my relationship with Elizabeth was, she was still technically my mother. The situation wasn't funny to me-just sadly familiar.

Sean's smile faded as he caught my expression. "Sorry, Summer, I didn't mean to-"

"I know," I said quietly. "It's just... nobody gets to choose their parents or where they're born. That's just life."

The city lights glimmered around us, casting shadows across the sidewalk.New York continued its relentless pace, unconcerned with my family
drama.
"Come on, let's get you in the car," Sean said, his voice gentler now."Brandon just called. He specifically instructed me to make sure you get home safely."

"That's not necessary." I replied. "I drove myself here."

"What's the big deal?" Sean insisted. "Just leave your car at Le Bernardin for now. Brandon can send someone to pick it up later."

I hesitated, then nodded. "Fine. Thank you."

"Hey, don't mention it." Sean grinned, returning to his usual carefree demeanor. "We're practically family now!"

I felt the tension melt from my shoulders the moment I stepped through the front door of Hamptons estate. Home.

Brandon appeared at the foot of the stairs almost instantly, having heard the car pull up. His eyes scanned me quickly, assessing.

"Brandon!" I called,rushing toward him.

"Mm," he responded simply, his stoic expression belying the relief in his eyes.

Sean followed me in, closing the door behind him. "Mission accomplished.Brandon," he announced cheerfully. "Though I gotta ask-how did you know someone was watching outside?"

I looked between them, confused. "What? Who was watching? What are you guys talking about?"

Brandon's hand came to rest protectively at the small of my back."
Nothing to worry about. You must be tired. Why don't you go upstairs and rest? Sean and I need to discuss something."

I studied his face, knowing he was deliberately keeping something from me and he wouldn't wanted me to know what that was. Decided to get a shower first. I said, "Okay."




Brandon's POV

I waited until June's footsteps faded before turning to Sean, my expression hardening. "Was someone following her?"

Sean raised an eyebrow. "You mean you were just guessing? Damn,Brandon, your instincts are scary sometimes."

"Was it Alexander?" I asked, already knowing the answer.

"Yeah." Sean nodded, dropping onto the couch without waiting for an invitation. "I spotted his car when I first arrived at the restaurant, and it was still there when we left. He wasn't exactly being subtle about it."

I poured myself a glass of scotch, offering one to Sean, who accepted it with a grateful nod.

"Brandon, that mother-in-law of yours is quite the character," Sean continued,swirling the amber liquid in his glass. "Talk about a quick change artist. Before I showed up, she was tearing into Summer like you wouldn't believe. The moment I walked in, she transformed-all smiles and enthusiasm, trying to push Summer at me. Kept insisting Summer was 'absoluately smitten' with my 'cousin Michael,' claiming the girl couldn't stop talking about him."
My jaw tightened. "And?"

"And when I went back-" Sean's voice lowered,"-Summer must have talked back to her, because Elizabeth had her hand raised. She was about to hit her, Brandon. Right there in Le Bernardin."

I felt cold fury wash through me, my fingers tightening around the glass."I see."

Sean studied me carefully. "The whole situation is bizarre. Summer's treated like an outsider in that family. But here's what I don't get-if that's how they feel about her, why are George Taylor and Professor Thompson so protective of her? It doesn't add up."
###Chapter 150: You Still Have Me

**Brandon's POV**
"What are you suggesting?" I asked, though I'd been pondering the same question.

Sean leaned forward. "I'm saying something's not right with Summer's relationship to the Taylor family. Don't you think it's... off?"

I set down my glass. "Have Edward look into it."

Sean nodded, then glanced at Max, who had settled at my feet. "Speaking of which, when are you planning to take Max back?"

"When are you planning to take him back?" I countered.

Sean stretched dramatically. "Max was once your dog! Remember? Besides,you know how busy the hospital keeps me. Besides, Max loves it here!Look how attached he's gotten to Summer!"

I fixed him with a cold stare. "Sean."

"Plus," he continued, ignoring my warning tone, "I think he's good for you.Reminds you of-"

The room temperature seemed to drop several degrees.

"Right," Sean said quickly, setting down his barely-touched drink and standing. "I should head out. Early surgery tomorrow."
After Sean left, I remained in the study, staring into the darkness outside.Max whined softly, sensing my mood shift, and nudged my hand with his nose. I absently scratched behind his ears, my mind racing with
unanswered questions about June's past.

I headed upstairs, mind racing. As I opened our bedroom door, June was just stepping out of the shower, wrapped in a fluffy towel with her hair dripping wet.
My eyes lingered on her involuntarily. The towel clung to her curves,accentuating the subtle swell of her breasts and the narrow dip of her waist. Water droplets traced paths down her long, slender neck,disappearing beneath the edge of the white terry cloth. Her skin was flushed from the hot water, giving her a radiant glow. Even with her hair darkened by water and her face free of makeup, she was breathtaking-not in the calculated way, but in an effortless, natural manner that was uniquely June.

"That was quick," she remarked, grabbing a smaller towel for her hair."Finished your chat with Sean already?"

I didn't answer immediately, taking in the sight of her-vulnerable yet somehow stronger than anyone I knew. "Come here," I finally said,my voice low.

She moved toward me without hesitation, asmile playing on her lips.I took the towel from her hands and gently began drying her hair, needing the simple contact after the unsettling conversation with Sean.

"Brandon,you're acting like a butler or something," June teased, relaxing under my touch. "You're basically managing every aspect of my life now."

"Is that a complaint?" I asked, my fingers working through her damp strands.

"Not at all," she replied softly. "No one's ever taken care of me like this
before.You even dry my hair for me."

I felt mny lips quirk slightly. Her apparent contentment seemed too deliberate. "Your sweet talk tonight suggests you've done something you shouldn't have."

June laughed, turning to face me. "Well, I did have dinner with another man today. Does that count as misbehaving?"

I tapped her forehead lightly with my finger. "Clever."

"Actually," shesaid, her tone growing more serious, "there is something I want to talk to you about."

My hands stilled, giving her my full attention. "Go ahead."

June took a deep breath. "My mother... she's clearly determined to marry me off. I don't think it's just about eliminating any threat I might pose to Victoria anymore. She wants to use me as a pawn. If I married Michael Sullivan, the Taylor family would gain connections to the Sullivan dynasty-much more valuable than what they had through Alexander and Fortune Corp."

She met my eyes directly. "I'm sure you've realized how my parents treat me. First it was Alexander, now Michael Sullivan-the target changes,but their objective remains the same. And if my mother had options, she wouldn't even want me to marry Michael Sullivan, because in her heart,I'll never be as important as Victoria."

My expression remained impassive, but I couldn't stop myself from reaching up to cup her cheek. "I know."

Those two simple words seemed to carry weight for her-a validation she'd been seeking for longer than I'd known her.
"You still have me," I said softly, squeezing her shoulder reassuringly.

June's face broke into a genuine smile as she placed her hand over mine."I know." she replied. Without me, I wondered what kind of situation she would be in now, trapped in the Taylor family's machinations.

When we first arranged our marriage, I knew she had primarily seen it as an escape from her family's control. She hadn't expected to develop any real feelings. I was... an unexpected variable in her equation. Yet she didn't seem to resist this unexpected development.

"Don't worry," she continued, her expression growing more serious."I'm not the same Summer I uased to be. I see things much more clearly now."She bit her lip. "My concern is that my mother will keep pushing me toward Michael Sullivan. You can't keep having Sean stand in forever.And what if Michael's parents find out about this charade?"

"Don't worry about it," I said, taking her hand and shifting to sit down,pulling her gently into my lap as I continued drying her hair. "Michael will handle it. This isn't something you need to concern yourself with."

"Speaking of which," June added, "Sean was pretty harsh with my mother today. Do you think she might go complain to Michael's mother?"

I paused, considering this angle I hadn't anticipated. After a moment, I shook my head. "It doesn't matter. Sean and Michael will handle it."

"Oh, okay," June nodded, visibly relieved. "That's good then."

As I held her close, the questions about her family still lingered. The strange disconnect between how her grandparents treated her versus her parents wasn't just odd-it felt deliberate. Something wasn't right with the Taylor family, and I was determined to uncover exactly what they were
hiding.
###Chapter 151: You Love Me Sucking Your Dic While You Drive

Victoria's POV
I approached my mother's bedroom. Even before entering, I could hear her muttering angrily to herself. I knocked once and pushed the door open.
"Mom?" I called. "You okay?"
Elizabeth sat at her vanity, violently brushing her hair. Her perfectly made-up face was twisted with rage. "What's wrong with you?" I asked, closing the door behind me.
She whirled around, slamming the brush down. "That woman! That Summer Taylor!"
I rolled my eyes, settling onto her bed. "Let me guess—she wouldn't play nice with Michael Sullivan?"
"Michael Sullivan is way out of her league anyway," I said, kicking off my heels. "She should be grateful anyone would look twice at her."
"Exactly!" Mom threw her hands up. "But you know what's worse? That Sullivan boy completely disrespected me too! I subtly brought up marriage prospects, and he practically laughed in my face!"
My eyebrows shot up. "Wait, what?"
"His mother Daisy still treats me with respect. But her son? Not an ounce of manners!"
I frowned, remembering Alexander's behavior earlier. "Mom, Alexander was totally distracted today when he heard Summer was meeting Michael. He was supposed to pick me up at three, but didn't show until after six!" My voice rose. "He was literally stalking them outside the restaurant!"
Mom froze. "Are you serious?"
"Dead serious. He's still obsessed with her."
"This cannot continue," Mom declared, her face hardening. "We need to get her married off immediately. Sullivan or not, I'll find someone else. As long as Summer remains single, neither of us will have any peace!"
I leaned forward, lowering my voice. "Mom, I might have a better idea. Remember Charles Windsor? I don't care what it takes. As long as Summer's available, Alexander will never fully be mine. I can't let her destroy what I've worked so hard for!"
Mom patted my hand, her eyes cold. "Don't worry, darling. I wouldn't let her ruin your happiness. Leave it to me. Just make sure you stay on his parents' good side. If they approve of you, Alexander won't dare leave."
"I know, Mom," I assured her. "I've got this under control."

The drive home was painfully silent. I knew exactly where Alexander had been earlier—stalking Summer outside Le Bernardin. The thought made me want to scream, but Mom was right. Fighting wouldn't help now. I had to be the wife he couldn't walk away from.
"You're quiet tonight," Alexander finally said, his eyes fixed on the road. "Something wrong?"
"Not really. Just something Mom said. She’s worried you’ll get tired of me. She thinks I focus too much on acting and not enough on being your wife. She suggested I quit and... start thinking about having children."
Alexander's expression softened with guilt—exactly as I'd planned. "That's your decision, Victoria. Have I done something to make you feel insecure? If so, I'm sorry."
"I know you love me," I said, reaching for his hand and interlacing our fingers. "I know you chose me. I understand I hurt Summer in the past. That's why Mom and I keep thinking about ways to settle her future, so everyone can move on."
Alexander hesitated, clearly battling his lingering feelings for Summer versus his obligation to me.
"Victoria," he finally said, "I promise I won't do anything you don't want. If you want children now, we'll have them. If you want to wait, we'll wait. And I won't ever leave you. Never."
"Thank you, Alexander," I whispered, satisfaction blooming inside me. "You're so good to me."
I shifted in the passenger seat, leaning across the console. I let my hand slide up his leg, my fingers resting high on his thigh. I felt him tense, his grip on the steering wheel tightening as the atmosphere in the car shifted instantly. The air grew thick with a sudden, heavy heat.
"Victoria," he muttered, his voice dropping into a low, strained register. "I'm driving."
"Then keep driving," I whispered into his ear, my lips brushing his skin. I didn't stop my hand; I let my touch become more insistent, more possessive. I wanted him to feel the power I held over him, a physical reminder that Summer was a ghost, and I was the reality.
I leaned down slightly, the scent of my perfume filling the small space, my touch slow and deliberate. Alexander let out a ragged breath, his foot pressing harder on the gas as the car sped through the dark streets. He was caught in the web I was spinning, his focus wavering between the road and the electric current running between us.
"See?" I said softly, looking up at him with a triumphant smile as I felt his pulse racing beneath my palm. "You don't need anyone else. You belong right here, with me."
He didn't answer, but the way he pulled the car over a few blocks from our house spoke louder than words. In the shadows of the parked car, I made sure he forgot every other name but mine.

###Chapter 152: Honey,Pay the Bill

**Summer's POV**

"You look like you've been working on the Manhattan subway construction,not at Stark Group," Ruby had teased during our lunch yesterday. "What's Leo doing, making you dig trenches?"

I'd glared at her, not appreciating the commentary. After days of following Leo Schmidt to project sites, I'd traded designer heels for practical sneakers and dress for simple activewear. My skin had darkened from hours under the sun, and I'd definitely lost weight.

Now, stuck in Manhattan's rush hour traffic onour way back from another site visit. I flipped through my notebook, reviewing observations. Leo drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, watching the congested road.

"I thought you'd be the type who expects everything handed to you," Leo suddenly remarked. "You know, a typical Manhattan princess."

I looked up, surprised by his attemnpt at personal conversation.

"Oh?" I raised an eyebrow. "And what type of person does Director Schmidt think I am now?"

"When we're off the clock, you can just call me Leo," he replied, his expression relaxing slightly.

When the traffic finally started moving again, I decided to address the elephant in the room.
"Leo," I began, "the reason you let me join this project... is it because of Brandon's influence?"
Leo didn't hesitate. "Yes. Mr. Stark did specifically instruct me to include you. Though I wasn't thrilled about it initially." He glanced at me. "But I figured if Mr. Stark saw potential in you, there must be something there."

I felt my cheeks warm.

I was about to continue when my phone rang. Brandon's name flashed on the screen. I hesitated before answering.


"Brandon!"

"You went out today?" His voice came through clearly.

"Yeah. I was out with Leo doing site inspections." I checked my watch."Are you off work? Are you actually leaving on time today?"

"Mmm," he hummed. "Where are you now?"

"Why don't you go home first? I need to stop by the office and then I'll-"

"Mr. Stark?" Leo suddenly interjected. When I nodded, he continued, "You're meeting Mr. Stark? Tell him I can drop you off."

"Won't that be too much trouble?" I asked.

Leo shook his head. "Not at all. Where are you two meeting?"

Brandon, who had clearly overheard, spoke up. "We're out of fresh groceries. Have Leo drop you at Whole Foods Market. I'll meet you there."

"Leo, would you mind taking me to Whole Foods?" I asked.

"No problem," he nodded, changing lanes.
I spotted Brandon immediately as we pulled up. He stood just outside the entrance, tall and commanding even in casual clothes. When he saw Leo's car,his posture straightened slightly.

"Thanks for the ride, Leo," I said, gathering my things.

"Goodbye. Miss Taylor," he replied formally.

The moment my feet hit the pavement. I couldn't help smiling.I practically jogged toward Brandon, who was waiting with that subtle half-smile that made my heart flutter. He extended his hand as I approached,and I slipped mine into his without hesitation.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Leo observing us from his car before finally driving away.

Brandon's fingers tightened around mine as we entered the store,pulling me closer until my hand was tucked inside his coat pocket.

"What should we have for dinner tonight?" I asked, leaning against his arm.

Brandon looked down, studying my face. He gently brushed the tip of my nose. "What do you want to eat?" HIis gaze intensified. "You look like you ve lost weight recently."

"Really?" I asked, surprised. "I actually feel like I've gained. I stepped on the scale the other day and was up a few pounds!"

Brandon pinched my cheek lightly. "No, you've definitely gotten thinner."

I swatted his hand away. "I don't believe you! I know I've gained weight.I see what you're doing-trying to get me to eat more so you can complain about me being fat later!"
Brandon chuckled. "You silly girl. Come on, let's get our groceries."

As we stood in the checkout line, Brandon's expression suddenly changed.A small smile curved his lips.

"What are you smiling about?" I asked.

"Alexander and Victoria are here," he replied casually, nodding toward the next checkout lane.

I tensed immediately, moving to hide behind his frame. "Are you serious?Why didn't you tell me sooner?" I clutched his arm. "They can't see us together!"

Brandon's smile vanished, his expression darkening. "Are you that afraid of them knowing about our relationship?"

"No!" I protested. "That's not it at all, don't misunderstand."

"Really? Then why are you hiding behind me?"

I frowned. "Look, you've seen how my mother tried to marry me off to both Charles Windsor and Michael Sullivan. On one hand,she wants to help Victoria get rid of me. On the other, she wants to use me to benefit the Taylor family."

I tightened my grip on his hand. "If they discover our relationship, they'll start scheming against you next. Victoria's already trying to exploit her connection to you through Alexander! Can you imagine what would happen if they found out we're married?"

I stared up at him earnestly. "I don't want our relationship contaminated by their manipulations. I want what we have to remain pure from all that."
I laced my fingers through his. "You have to trust me. How could someone as amazing as you ever be something I'd hide? I've already introduced you to the people who matter most to me."

Brandon's expression softened, his lips curving into a small smile.

"I can't argue with that," he conceded. "I apologize for jumping to conclusions."


"That's better." I replied, feeling relieved.

"By the way." I said, "Victoria's movie has started filming, right?"

"I believe so. I don't really oversee Stark Entertainment directly. If you want details, ask James. And keeping our relationship private for now is probably wise."

I grinned mischievousy. "Brandon, I've just realized how devious you can be."


"Oh?" His eyebrow raised.

"When Victoria eventually discovers our relationship-after you've already wrecked whatever schemes she's cooking up-she's going to absolutely lose her mind."

Brandon studied my expression before ruffling my hair. "You're becoming quite the troublemaker. When did mysweet wife develop such a mischievous streak?"
I laughed, batting his hand away. "Oh, you just don't know me well enough yet! You'll discover I'm full of surprises."
When we finally reached the checkout, Brandon nudged me forward. As
the cashier began scanning our items, Brandon reached past me to grab something from a display rack-a box of condoms.

My eyes widened in horror. "Brandon!" I hissed, grabbing his wrist. "What are you doing?"


I tried to take the box from him, but Brandon simply moved his hand,placing the item on the conveyor belt before I could stop him.

The cashier paused briefly, her professionalism only momentarily betrayed by a raised eyebrow before scanning the item.

I felt my face burning, acutely aware of the cashier's subtle glances. When I tried to shuffle away toward the exit, Brandon caught my arm.

"Honey," he said, his voice carrying just enough authority to stop me in my tracks, "pay the bill."
###Chapter 153: Which One Would You Like to
Try Tonight?

**Summer's POV**

I rubbed my aching neck as I made my way downstairs. I'd been holed up in Brandon's study for over an hour, poring over Manhattan West Side project documents until the numbers started swimming before my eyes.

"Something smells amazing," I called out, following the mouthwatering aroma to the kitchen.

Brandon appeared in the doorway, dish towel slung over his shoulder. He gestured toward the dining room. "Perfect timing. Wash your hands and come eat."

I headed to the sink, stealing glances at the table. "Holy shit. Brandon! Did you invite the entire Stark Group executive board over?" The table was loaded with at least six different dishes-far too much food for just us two.

Brandon gave me a critical once-over. "You've lost too much weight.And you've been working too hard lately."

"Well, that's not exactly my fault," I shot back, grabbing a piece of broccoli."The Manhattan West Side project is keeping me crazy busy. Leo says it'll probably be like this for the next few months." I flashed him a teasing smile. "So, dear, I guess all the household chores are falling on your shoulders from now on."

Brandon reached out, his palm cool against my forehead as he brushed back my hair. He took my hand, leading me into the kitchen. "By the way,I need to use the study later. Are you done in there?"
"Yeah, I'm good for now." I hesitated. "What are you working on these days? You've seemed... preoccupied."

"Just some routine matters. Nothing you'd find interesting." His dark eyes studied me. "Why? Want to trade jobs?"

"No way!" I laughed,pulling out my chair.

As I settled in, I watched Brandon serve the food with practiced efficiency.

"If things get too overwhelming," Brandon offered, placing a heaping portion on my plate, "I can have Leo adjust your workload."

"That won't be necessary," I said, raising an eyebrow. "I know you're worried about me, but I want to handle this on my own. I need to prove myself."

After dinner, Brandon retreated to the study while I lounged on our bed,scrolling through messages from Ruby and Scarlett in our group chat.

**Scarlett:***Victoria came to my coffee shop today. With her old squad.*

**Me:***Seriously? What were they doing there?*

**Scarlett:***Planning some birthday bash. Is Victoria's birthday tomorrow?

*

I paused before typing:

**Me:** *Yeah, it is.*

**Scarlett:** *They were going on about inviting old classmates and making it this huge thing. Now that she's filming that movie and married to Alexander,she's really letting it go to her head.*
**Me:** *Sounds like Victoria.*

I couldn't help but smile wryly. Victoria had always been this way-self-important and desperate for attention. Now that she had both Alexander and her Stark Entertainment contract, she probably felt untouchable. And I knew exactly why she'd want to make her birthday a big deal-another opportunity to parade her "perfect life" in front of everyone, especially me.

"What's so amusing?"

I nearly jumped out of my skin. Brandon was sitting at the foot of the bed.watching me with that intense gaze of his. I hadn't even heard him come in.

"Jesus, Brandon! Wear a bell or something," I gasped, clutching my phone to my chest. "Are you done working already?"

I scrambled across the bed to his side. "Want me to run you a bath?"

Brandon caught my hand, his eyes darkening. "No need."

Before I could react, he had me pinned beneath him, his weight pressing me into the mattress.

"Brandon," I whispered, suddenly very aware of his proximity.

He lowered his head, his voice dropping to that silky, dangerous tone that always made my stomach flip. "June."

I swallowed hard, my hands pushing feebly against his chest. "Not tonight,okay? I'm tired."

His eyes grew even darker, and he caught my lower lip between his teeth."Which one would you like to try tonight? Orange or strawberry?"
My face erupted in flames as I realized what he was suggesting. I gripped his shirt, my voice shaking slightly. "Can we please not do this tonight?"

His answering smile told me everything I needed to know about how the rest of our evening would unfold.


The next morning, I groaned as I tried to sit up, my lower back protesting every movement. Brandon, looking far too rested and satisfied for my liking, pulled me back against his chest, pressing a soft kiss to the corner of my eye.

"Good morning," he murmured.

I shot him an accusatory glare. "That's it-you're slëeping in the gulest room tonight."

Brandon's eyebrow arched, his lips curving into a smug smile. "Not a chance."

"Oh my god," I groaned, reaching up to pinch his cheek. "How are you this shameless?"

He caught my hand, enfolding it in his larger one, his thumb tracing circles on my palm.

"Stop that," I muttered, trying to sound stern. "We're going to be late for work."


\---

"Miss Taylor?"
Leo's voice snapped me back to reality. We were at the potential development site when my phone had rung. Victoria's name on the screen
had immediately soured my mood.

She'd called to "personally invite" me to her upcoming birthday celebration-framing it as though she were doing me a favor, when we both knew it was just another opportunity for her to showcase her triumph.

"Summer?" Leo called again, studying me with that analytical gaze of his."Everything okay?"

I tucked my phone back into my bag and flipped open my notebook. "I'm fine."

Leo didn't look convinced. "Your focus seems off. Personal issue?"

I shook my head. "Nothing major." I redirected, "So, you were saying about the psych hospital? Upper management wants it demolished?"

Leo nodded. "That's what Mr. Stark indicated. But before demolition can even be considered, we need to address where the patients would go."

"But isn't that outside our scope?" I asked, frowning.

Leo's lips quirked into a half-smile. "That's where you're mistaken.Mr.Stark's directive is for Stark Group to handle the entire situation."

I blinked in surprise. "Really? Why?"

Leo gave me a curious look. "Mr. Stark hasn't discussed this with you?Given your...connection."

I tensed slightly. "No. Our work doesn't overlap that way. At the company,I'm just your subordinate-no special treatment."
Leo fell silent, studying me with renewed interest before checking his ut's getting late. We should head back."
The sun was setting as Leo pulled into the Stark Group parking garage.

I spotted a familiar figure by the entrance of the Stark Tower-Alexander,looking anxiously toward the garage.

When he saw us, his face lit up with recognition, and he started walking
in our direction.

"You know him?" Leo asked, following my gaze.

I nodded. "Yeah."

"Then I'll leave you to it. See you tomorrow." Leo gave me a curt nod before heading toward the elevators.

Alexander approached, his shoes clicking against the concrete. His hair was perfectly styled, his suit immaculate. But his eyes held that same desperate look they'd had at Victoria's wedding.

"Are you here to see Mr. Stark?" I asked coolly.

Alexander shook his head. "No. I came to see you, Summer."
###Chapter 154: Summer's Gift

**Summer's POV**

"Me?" I couldn't keep the disbelief from my voice.

His gaze traveled down my figure, his brow furrowing slightly. "You've lost weight. A lot of weight."

I felt my expression harden instantly. "If that's all you came to say, I need to get back to work. It's business hours, in case you haven't noticed."


Alexander's face stiffened, clearly not used to this cold treatment from me."Summer, do we really have to be like this? After everything we've been through?"

A bitter laugh escaped me. "And how exactly should we be? Did you expect us to be best buddies? If you don't have anything important to say,I'm heading back upstairs."

As I turned to leave, his hand shot out, not quite touching me but effectively stopping my retreat. "Summer, wait!"

He sighed, running a hand through his perfectly styled hair. "Look, I know you're still upset with us, and you have every right to be. But I heard from Elizabeth that she's arranging a match for you. Some Sullivan guy? Are you...are you happy with him?"
I snorted, crossing my arms tightly across my chest. "Seriously? *That's*why you're here? Let me make one thing perfectly clear, Alexander. Just because you married my sister doesn't give you any right to meddle in my personal life. Are we done here?"
His expression fell, and he rushed to explain. "I heard you're working at
Stark Group now, so I thought I'd check on you. I was worried after you left Fortune Corp that you might be struggling."

The condescension in his tone made my blood boil. "Oh, I see. So what you're really saying is that you didn't think I was capable of surviving without Fortune Corp? ThatI couldn't possibly find another job without your help? Wow. Anything else you'd like to insult me with today?"


Alexander seemed to realize his mistake, but instead of apologizing, he reathed into his jacket pocket and pulled out an elegantly embossed envelope.

"Actually, there is one more thing," he said, holding it out to me. "Victoria's birthday is coming up. Since it's our first year of marriage, she wants to throw a big celebration,so..."

I took the envelope, my curiosity getting the better of me. Opening it, I nearly choked when I saw what was inside-a fancy invitation decorated with Victoria and Alexander's wedding photos. Not birthday photos. *Wedding* photos.

"Well, isn't this special," I said, unable to keep the sarcasm from my voice."I've heard of birthday parties before, but turning your birthday into a second wedding reception? That's a first. What's next? Are you two planning to get married again?"

Alexander's face paled as he took the invitation from my hands,his eyes widening in shock as he finally noticed the wedding photos.

"This... I don't understand," he stammered, clearly caught off guard. "This isn't what I..."

"Don't worry about it," I said with a cold smile, snatching the invitation
back. "She's my only sister, after all. Of course I'll be there to celebrate her birthday." I tucked the invitation into my bag. "If that's all, I really should get back to work."


I walked away without a backward glance, feeling Alexander's eyes boring into my back.


The second I stepped into the elevator, my phone rang. Brandon's name flashed on the screen.


"Come to my office," he said the moment I answered, his voice tight with barely contained anger.

"What's wrong?" I asked, surprised. "How did you krow I'm back in the building? Did you see me outside?"

"You think I wouldn't notice Alexander Stark making a scene at my company's front entrance?" he replied, the edge in his voice unmistakable."What was that about?"

"Calm down" I soothed, leaning against the elevator wall. "It's nothing to worry about. He just came to deliver an invitation. That's all."

"An invitation?" Brandon's tone turned suspicious. "For what? Are they celebrating something? Don't tell me they're getting married again."

I couldn't help laughing at his uncanny guess. "You got it in one!Alexander gave me an invitation with their wedding photos plastered all over it. You should have seen his face when he realized-he looked like he'd seen a ghost."

"So you're planning to go?" Brañdon asked after a moment.

"Of course I'ma going," I replied, determination creeping into my voice."
Victoria's obviously planned something special for her birthday gift to herself-most likely finding some way to humiliate me in public. But this time. I've got a little surprise gift of my own prepared for her."




Victoria's birthday celebration was even more extravagant than I'd expected.The venue was dripping with opulence-crystal chandeliers, champagne fountains, and an army of waitstaff in crisp uniforms. Half of Manhattan's trust fund babies seemed to be in attendance, no doubt drawn by Victoria's new status as both a Stark Entertainment talent and Alexander Stark's wvife.


I spotted Sophie and Anna near the entrance, playing their roles as Victoria's loyal handmaidens to perfection. Several of our old classmates were scattered throughout the crowd, including Chris Diaz, who kept stealing glances in may direction. Noticeably absent were Ruby and Scarlett-not that I'd expected Victoria to invite them.

As I surveyed the room, my heart stuttered when I spotted a familiar face-Charles Windsor. The sight of him sent alarm bells ringing in my head. After what had happened the last time he'd been around me, his presence here could only mean trouble.

I watched as Victoría noticed Charles's arrival, her face lighting up with calculated charm as she glided over to greet him. Our classmates seemed oblivious to his identity, but the way the other wealthy guests gave him a wide berth spoke volumes about his reputation.

"Victoria," Charles purred, raising his champagne flute. "It's been too long.Happy birthday to you!"
He took her hand and pressed his lips to it in a move that lingered just a beat too long to be proper. Leaning close to her ear,he murmured
something that made her cheeks flush.

"You look absolutely stunning tonight," he said,loud enough for nearby guests to hear.

Victoria seemed momentarily flustered, almost entranced by his attention before catching herself. "Thank you for the unique birthday wishes,Charles."


"For an exquisite woman like yourself, only unique will do," he replied smoothly, his eyes trailing over her in a way that was borderline inappropriate for a married woman.

"Well," Victoria said, clearly uncomfortable but trying to maintain her composure, "the celebration hasn't officially started yet. If you'll excuse me,I need to attend to my other guests."

Charles watched her retreat, something calculating flashing in his eyes that made me shiver despite myself.

It wasn't long before Victoria spotted me. I saw the momentary flash of jealousy in her eyes as she took in my appearance, quickly masked by a fake smile as she approached.

"Summer!" she exclaimed, grabbing my hands with theatrical enthusiasm. "You made it! I was beginning to think you wouldn't come."
###Chapter 155: Revenge

**Summer's POV**

"And miss my only sister's birthday?" I replied, matching her saccharine tone. "I wouldn't dream of it."


I reached into my purse and pulled out a small velvet box tied with an elegant silver ribbon. Victoria's eyes immediately zeroed in on it, a flash of contempt briefly crossing her perfect features. I could practically hear her thoughts: *What could little Summer possibly afford that would be worthy of me?*

"Today's your special day," I said, offering her the box. "I don't have much to give my big sister, but I spent a month's salary on this necklace. I hope you like it?"

Victoria took the box, her fingers grazing mine with obvious reluctance.Her lips curved into that patronizing smile I knew all too well-the one that said,*How cute that you think your pathetic salary could buy anything worth having.*

"That's... thoughtful of you, Summer," she said, clearly preparing to feign delight before subtly belittling whatever modest trinket she expected to find inside.

She untied the ribbon with deliberate slowness, drawing out the moment for maximum effect. As she lifted the lid, her expression shifted from condescending amusement to stunned disbelief. Her perfectly manicured fingers trembled as they hovered above the contents.

"This... Summer, this is..." Her voice faltered, eyes widening in shock.
Inside lay the "Heart of the Ocean" necklace-the exquisite blue diamond pendant that hadI once been Alexander's gift to me. The same necklace Victoria had coveted from the moment she first saw it around my neck.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" I said, my eyes narrowing slightly as I smiled. "The moment I saw it, I just knew it would suit you perfectly. I've been saving up for months, living on ramen and tap water to buy this for you. It was worth every sacrifice."

I lifted the necklace from its velvet cushion, the sapphire-blue stone catching the light, sending prisms dancing across Victoria's frozen face.

"Let me help you put it on, sis," I offered, stepping closer.

"NO!" Victoria jerked back so violently she nearly dropped the box. "DON'T TOUCH ME!"

Her shriek echoed through the ballroom, silencing nearby conversations.Dozens of heads turned our way, eyes widening at the spectacle of the
birthday girl losing her composure.

Victoria ínstantly recognized her mistake. I watched the calculations behind her eyes as she struggled to regain control, to find a way to save face.

"I'm... I'm so sorry, Summer," she stammered, forcing a tremulous smile."I didn't mean to snap at you. It's just-this necklace is so incredibly valuable, I was momentarily overwhelmed. I'm just so touched that you would save for months to buy me something this special!"

Her performance was Oscar-worthy-voice breaking with artificial emotion.eyes glistening with tears that wouldn't fall. But I could see the rage simmering beneath, threatening to boil over at any moment.
*She knows exactly what this necklace is. She remembers every detail of the day Alexander gave it to me for my birthday. How her envy had eventually driven her to steal not just the necklace, but the man who gave it to me.*

"Of course," I replied softly, maintaining my innocent smile."You're my only sister, after all. I couldn't properly celebrate your wedding,so I wanted to make sure your birthday was special."

I stepped closer, pressing the necklace into her palm and closing her fingers around it. "I wore it once or twice myself, but honestly, it suits you much better. I'm just so happy to give it to you. Aren't you pleased?"

Victoria's face had gone rigid, her complexion ashen beneath her perfect makeup. "You... Summer, you..."

I patted her hand, feeling the tension in her fingers as they clutched the necklace. "Be careful not to drop it."

"You're doing this on purpose," she hissed,her voice low enough that only I could hear.

I blinked innocently. "Doing what? I came especially to wish you happy birthday."

She was visibly shaking now, her knuckles white around the necklace, but too aware of her watching guests to make a scene.

I leaned in, my voice dropping to a whisper. "Don't worry about thanking me properly. I'll be sure to bring even better gifts on your next birthday celebration."

I watched with savage satisfaction as Victoria's perfect mask began to crack.the one who always stepped back,
always gave in, always surrendered what was mine without complaint.I'd convinced myself that taking the high road meant suffering in silence, that dignity meant accepting mistreatment without fighting back.

But seeing Victoria's face now, I realized how much power I'd given away by being the "good sister." I'd let her believe she could take everything from me without consequences. I didn't love Alexander anymore-hadn't for a long time-but that didn't erase the betrayal. They hadn't just stolen my fianacé; they'd trampled my trust, my dignity, and my place in my own family.


Being with Brandon had changed something fundamental in me. He'd shown me that I deserved more-that being selfish wasn't a sin when it meant valuing myself enough to fight back. The world wouldn't protect me; no one would stand up for me if I wouldn't stand up for myself.

"You have so many guests to attend to," I said, stepping back. "I shouldn't monopolize the birthday girl."

I released Victoria's hand and moved away, feeling lighter than I had in years. The weight of being the family pushover had finally lifted from my shoulders.

I found a quiet corner and settled into a plush chair, watching the party unfold from a safe distance. Victoria had plastered on her socialite smile again, though her movements were stiffer now, her laughter a touch too loud. She'd tucked the necklace away somewhere-probably couldn't bear to look at it.

My moment of triumph was short-lived when I spotted Charles Windsor moving through the crowd, his predatory gaze fixed directly on me. My stomach dropped instantly. Of all the people Victoria could have invited,why him? Every muscle in my body tensed as he wove between guests
with determined grace, heading straight for my corner.

I looked around desperately for an escape route, but I was effectively trapped. The last time we'd crossed paths hadn't exactly ended well,and Brandon had explicitly warned me to stay away from him. Charles Windsor was dangerous-the kind of danger that came wrapped in bespoke suits and smooth charm.

"Miss Taylor, it's been a while."

I jumped slightly at his voice, now right in front of me. My hands instinctively gripped my clutch tighter as I looked up to find him looming over me, champagne flute in hand and that unsettling smile playing on his lips.
###Chapter 156:Faking

**Summer's POV**

I frowned slightly,glancing toward Victoria across the ballroom. "You and my sister seem well-acquainted."


Charles raised an eyebrow. "No, to be precise, Miss Taylor, it's you and I who are well-acquainted, wouldn't you agree?" His eyes roamed over me invasively, as though mentally undressing me right there in the middle of the ballroom.


"I wouldn't call one unfortunate encounter being 'well-acquainted," I replied coldly.

Charles chuckled, amused by my hostility. "Such unfriendliness, Miss Taylor! What have I done to deserve such contempt?"

"Because you're an asshole," I said bluntly. "What are you plotting today?"

Insteadof being offended, Charles looked even more intrigued. "You know,it's fascinating. We do seem to have a certain... connection, you and I.I won't deny I have ulterior motives today, but don't worry-you're not my target."

I shook my head in disgust and stood up.

As I walked away without a word, I could feel his eyes following me,burning into my back.

The ladies' room was a sanctuary of marble and soft lighting,mercifully empty when I entered. I leaned against the sink, trying to steady my breathing. The encounter with Charles had rattled me more than I cared to admit.
一akg

I was patting cod water on my wrists when I heard the door open behind me. My heart sank, expecting Victoria or one of her minions,but the reflection in the mirror revealed Anna Watson.

Anna's scars had faded somewhat since I'd last seen her, though they were still visible beneath her expertly applied makeup. Her eyes met mine in the mirror, a strange determination in her gaze.

"Anna?" I asked warily, turning to face her directly.

Anna didn't answer immediately. Instead,she walked past me, checking under each stall door to ensure we were alone. Satisfied,she pushed the main door closed, then turned the lock.

"It's me," she said unnecessarily, her voice hushed and urgent. "I don't have much timne, so I'll make this quick. Victoria invited Charles here today,and I'm sure you've figured out why. She's going to offer you a drink later-it'll be drugged. She asked me to keep an eye on you.I'll switch out your drink. Just pretend to be tipsy afterward and leave. I'm supposed to take you to a private room, but you need to find a way to slip away from me."


I stared at her, processing this information. "Drugged? Seriously? She couldn't think of any other way?"

Anna nodded grimly.

Anna's lips tightened into a thin line. "Sophie is watching Charles-his drink will be drugged too. I've heard rumors about him...."

"Wait, Charles is getting drugged too? Does he know what Victoria is planning?" I asked.

Anna shook her head. "I'm not sure. I don't know what his game is today,
but don't let down your guard. I gotta go now."

I searched her face, trying to detect any sign of deception. "Thank you," I said finally, the words feeling strange directed at someone who'd once helped try to kill me. "I appreciate the warning."

Anna's expression softened marginally. "Don't thank me. I didn't like you before, it's true. But you never really did anything awful to me, and I've paid for my mistakes." She touched one of her scars unconsciously."I'm not doing this for you-I'm doing it for myself. Now I need to go before Victoria gets suspicious."

With that cryptic statement, she unlocked the door and slipped out,leaving me alone with my thoughts.

Back in the ballroom, Victoria spotted me instantly, weaving through the crowd with predatory grace.

"Summer!" she called, her voice dripping with fake sisterly concern."I've been looking everywhere for you!"

"Just needed a moment," I replied, forcing a smile. "Great party, by the way. Where's Alexander? Shouldn't he be celebrating with you?"

Something flashed in Victoria's eyes before quickly disappearing.

"Oh, he's been absolutely swamped with work," she said,waving dismissively. "Fortune Corp is in the middle of a major deal. You know how it is-or maybe you don't, since you're at Stark Group now."

The dig was so typical Victoria that I almost laughed.

"Speaking of which," she continued smoothly, "let's have a drink! It's my birthday, afterall.We should celebrate... sisterhood."
On cue, a waiter appeared with a tray of champagne flutes. Victoria took two, offering one to me with a smile that didn't reach her eyes. From across the room, I caught Anna's subtle nod.

"To new beginnings," Victoria said, raising her glass.

I mirrored her gesture. "To family," I replied, taking a small sip.

Victoria's eyes gleamed with satisfaction. "I'm so glad we could put aside our differences, Summer. It's my birthday, and all those misunderstandings between us-they're in the past now. Your big sister promises to take good care of you from now on."

"Thanks, sis." I replied with a saccharine smile, clinking my glass against hers.


I noticed Sophie approaching Charles with a drink. He accepted it gallantly,downing it in one smooth motion. Within minutes, he began showing signs of intoxication-his movements becoming looser, his laughter too loud.


Charles leaned toward Sophie, whispering to her ear.

Sophie blushed visibly, her confidence bolstered. "Mr. Windsor..."

Sophie swayed slightly, looking dizzy. Charles narrowed his eyes, then smoothly wrapped an arm around her shoulders. "Strange," he murmured."I've barely had anything to drink, yet I feel... intoxicated."

Sophie's eyes brightened. "Mr. Windsor? perhaps I should help you find somewhere to rest?"

"Yes," Charles agreed readily. "That would be most appreciated."
I took the opportunity to really sell my act. "Whoaa," I slurred slightly,stumbling as I set down my glass. "Thi' champagne is strong..."

Victoria's eyes lit up with malicious delight. "Summer? Are you feeling alright?"

I blinked rapidly, as if trying to focus. "Just... a li'l light-headed. Maybe I should...sit down somewhere?"


Victoria made a show of looking concerned. "This is so unlike you,Summer. Perhaps you should lie down for a bit?" She glanced around theatrically. "I could have Anna take you to one of the rest rooms?"

"That... would be nice," I mumbled,swaying on my feet.

Victoria beckoned to Anna. "Anna, would you mind taking my sister to the rest area? She's not feeling well."


"Of course," Anna replied, coming to my side and slipping an arm around my waist. "Come on, let's get you somewhere quiet."


As Anna led me away, I caught Victoria's triumphant smile, her eyes following us as we left the ballroom.

Once we were in the hallway, Anna kept up the charade until we were out of sight. Then she whispered urgently, "You should knock me out, then escape. Either go back to the ballroom or just leave entirely. Charles is a wild card-even with Sophie watching him, I don'ttrust what might happen if he finds you."

"Hit you? No can do, Anna. There has to be another way," I whispered back, uncomfortable with the suggestion.

"Then you go ahead and leave. I'll just say I already took you to the room.
"Okay," I agreed.

"Wait," Anna tensed suddenly, pulling me closer to the wall. "Someone's following us. Victoria must have sent one of her paparazzi friends-she's planning to create a scandal around you tonight."


I heard footsteps approaching from around the corner. "Let's go to the bathroom," I whispered, tugging Anna toward the nearest ladies' room.
###Chapter 157: Get Ready for the Show

**Anna's POV**

The bathroom tiles pressed against my palm as I watched Summer peek through the cracked door. My heart hammered-not from fear,but from the twisted path my life had taken. Here I was, helping the woman I once tried to destroy.

"I think they're gone." Summer whispered, turning back.

"You should go," she said decisively. "Victoria will get suspicious."

"Right." I nodded, composing myself. "I'Il head back first."




The ballroom's opulence was suffocating-crystal chandeliers dripping from the ceiling, champagne flowing like water. I approached Victoria,who was scanning the crowd with predatory alertness.

"Well?" she demanded immediately. "How'd it go?"

"Relax, I already took her to the rest room. She's completely out of it-didn't even put up a fight." The lie slid smoothly from my lips.

Victoria's red lips curved into a satisfied smile. "Perfect."

"What about Charles?" I asked, scanning the room. "Did Sophie handle him?"

"Not sure yet. Sophie hasn't texted back, but the paparazzi are in position."Her eyes glittered with malice. "We can head over soon."

"You're sure this will work?"
"Oh, please. Trust me. Anna. This time we'll finally get our revenge.Summer's going to wish she'd never been born."

Victoria's gaze fixated on my face, her expression shifting to fake concern.

"Anna, when are you getting that reconstructive surgery?" she asked.

I brushed my fingers over the scars, my eyes hardening. "After this is finished. Joe promised he'd take care of it."

"Good. Don't worry, Anna. Tonight will make everythingworth it."


I forced a grateful smile, knowing how little I cared about revenge anymore. AIl I wanted was Brandon's guarantee that Watson Group and me would be safe.


The ballroom doors swung open, and Alexander entered. Victoria immediately perked up.

"Alex!" she called, latching onto his arm. "You finally made it! Working so late-aren't you exhausted?"

I didn't miss the flash of irritation that crossed his face before he masked it.

"I'm fine," he replied, his smile not reaching his eyes."Just running late.You're not angry,are you?"

"How could I be? You're working so hard, providing for us! Oh, Alex, so many friends came today-even Summer showed up! Let me introduce you around!"

At Summer's name, Alexander's pupils dilated noticeably. *Interesting*,I thought.*He still cares,*

After parading him around, Victoria checked her watch and texted me:"
How's it going with Sophie? Any updates?"

I replied: "Probably done by now, but Sophie hasn't responded to me either."


Frowning, I tried calling Sophie. No answer. Uneasiness settled in my stomach.


Victoria turned to find Alexander staring across the ballroom. She deliberately gasped, snapping him to attention.

"What's wrong?" he asked, instantly alert.

"Nothing, really. I just realized I haven't seen Summer in a while..."

She turned to me with calculated casualness. "Anna, have you seen Summer?"

I stepped into my role. "Didn't I just take her to rest? She was pretty wasted. But it's been thirty minutes. Strange she hasn't come back."

"Victoria," I added, "shouldn't you be cutting your cake soon?"

"You're right," Victoria nodded. "'It's about time. It's just Summer..."

Alexander straightened. "I'll go check on her. She's your sister-she shouldn't miss something this important."

Victoria's eyes lit up with triumph. "That's so thoughtful! I'll come with you!"

As they departed, I felt curious eyes turn toward me. *Show time*.

"Victoria's gone to get her sister Summer," I announced loudly. "She was here earlier,you know."
The statement hung in the air, loaded with implication. Victoria paused at the doorway.


"Anna, please entertain everyone while I check on Summer!"

"No problem!" I called back with a bright smile.

The moment they disappeared, the guests descended on me.

"I've heard Summer and Victoria never got along," one socialite probed.

"Don't you remember?" another added. "At Victoria's engagement, Summer caused a scene. Something about sisters fighting over the same man-it was all over Page Six."

"Anna, you must know the inside story," pressed a.third.

I widened my eyes, adopting a gossipy tone. "Do you really want to know?Why don't we all go see for ourselves? I have a feeling tonight's going to be quite... entertaining."

Like moths to flame, the crowd drifted toward the door. I hung back,calling Summer quickly to confirm she was safe before deleting the call log and following.

I rounded the corner to see Victoria and Alexander in conversation.

"Alex, don't be angry no matter what Summer says," Victoria was pleading."I invited her partly to apologize, but also hoping she might meet someone suitable here. I know I've been selfish, but I love you so much!"

"I don't blame you," Alexander finally said. "Whatever she says, I won't lose my temper."

Victoria nodded. "Summer should be resting in that room."
Alexander reached for the door, but Victoria caught his wrist. "Let me,"she insisted, knocking lightly.

"Summer? Are you in there? It's Victoria. Cake-cutting time!"

Silence greeted her.

"Maybe she's asleep?" Victoria suggested innocently.

She knocked again-and then it happened. We all heard the unmistakable sounds: breathless moans, rhythmic movement, a woman crying out in pleasure.

Victoria's face flushed dramatically. "Oh! I think we have the wrong room!"

Alexander's expression darkened instantly, his hands clenching into fists.

"This is your birthday," he growled. "I rented this entire floor. There shouldn't be anyone else here."

Victoria positioned herself between Alexander and the door. "Alex, calm down. This must be a mistake."

"Summer wouldn't..." Victoria continued, her voice trembling. "She's not that kind of person!"

"Move," Alexander commanded, his voice like ice.


"Alex, no! People are watching!"

I stepped forward with the crowd, watching the drama unfold. Alexander shot Victoria an accusatory glare.

"It wasn't me!" she protested. "I didn't invite them!"
Victoria turned to face us with perfectly feigned surprise. "Anna, what are you all doing here?"

"Nothing," I stammered. "They were just-"

"Oh, we got bored," interrupted a socialite. "All the important people disappeared, so we thought we'd see what was happening."

A woman's voice cried out from behind the door-a sound of such raw intensity that it sent uncomfortable shivers through the crowd.


Victoria's face crumpled with embarrassment. "Everyone, this is all a misunderstanding. My sister just had too much to drink and needed to rest."

"Resting?" sneered another guest. "If that's resting, perhaps Victoria should call her sister out. It seems inappropriate for her to miss her own sister's birthday,doesn't it?"

A bold guest stepped forward. "If Victoria won't knock, perhaps we should do it for her!"

Alexander blocked the way. "Nobody touches that door," he snarled.

"Alexander," the guest argued, "we're only trying to help-"

"What are you all doing here?"

The voice-calm and unmistakably familiar-cut through the tension like a knife.
###Chapter 158: You Reap What You Sow

**Summer's POV**

"What are you all doing here?"

The words left my mouth before I fully processed the scene before me-Victoria. Alexander, and a crowd of party guests all huddled outside a hotel room door, looking like kids caught with their hands in the cookie jar. The hallway fell silent instantly, every head whipping in my direction.

Victoria's face drained of color, her perfectly made-up features contorting in shock."Summer?" she choked out, her voice unnaturally high. "You...you're here? How are you here?"

"Where else would I be? Didn't Anna just bring me here to rest?" I turned toward Anna, whose eyes were wide with barely concealed relief.

"Yes," Anna quickly confirmed, nodding vigorously. "I definitely brought Summer here to rest earlier."

Victoria shook her head frantically, her diamond earrings catching the light as they swung. "This isn't possible," she insisted, her voice climbing higher."Summer, you were just... I mean, we heard..." She gestured helplessly at the door.

"Heard what?" I asked innocently, glancing between the door and the increasingly uncomfortable crowd. "I was feeling a bit woozy from the champagne, so I went to freshen up in the bathroom. What's going on?Why is everyone standing out here?"

Theassembled guests exchanged awkward glances. Some were already backing away, sensing that whatever drama was unfolding wasn't going
according to plan.

Victoria's fingers twisted nervously in her designer dress. "Summer, it's my birthday,remember?


We're about to cut the cake, so Alexander and I came to get you. Since you're already here, let's head back to the ballroom!"


Her smile was so brittle it looked like it might shatter her face.


"All these people came to fetch me for cake?" I asked, making a show of glancing around at the crowd. "Wow, I'm flattered! I didn't realize my presence was so crucial to your birthday celebration, sis."

Victoria's smile froze. "No, that's not-"

"What were you all doing before I showed up?" I pressed, watching Victoria squirm. "You all seem pretty interested in that room."

"Nothing!" Victoria practically shouted. "It's nothing at all!"

Just then, a particularly loud moan filtered through the door,followed by rhythmic thumping. Several guests tittered nervously while others looked away in embarrassment.

One of the bolder guests-a middle-aged man who'd clearly had too much champagne-stepped forward. "Oh, for God's sake! If no one else will do it-"He lurched toward the door and gave it a solid kick before anyone could stop him.

The flimsy hotel lock gave way instantly, the door swinging open to reveal a scene that made several guests gasp audibly.

Inside the dimly lit room, Sophie lay sprawled across the bed, her dress
hiked up and hair wildly disheveled. Beside her was Chris Diaz-our former classmate-and another man I didn't recognize. Sophie's makeup was smeared down her face, her eyes unfocused. The entire tableau was sordid and disturbing.

"Oh my God!" someone exclaimed. "Isn't that-"

Victoria lunged forward, her face contortedI in panic. "Everyone, get back!Move away!"


Alexander grabbed Victoria's arm, yanking her backward. "Stay here," he ordered sharply before turning to the group of men behind him. "Get them out of here.Now!"


In the chaos, security guards herded the shocked guests away from the doorway. I remained frozen in place, my jaw clenched as I watched the chaos unfold. Although I'd suspected Victoria was planning something ugly, I hadn't expected this. The sight of Sophie-clearly drugged and disoriented-made bile rise in my throat.

As the hallway cleared, I caught a glimpse of Victoria's face. She wasn't just surprised or embarrassed-she was devastated. Whatever she'd planned, this wasn't it.


After the guests were escorted away, Victoria approached Sophie cautiously,reaching out a trembling hand.

"Sophie?" she said softly. "Sophie, it's me, Victoria. I'm here to help you."

Sophie's head snapped up, her eyes focusing for a brief, terrible moment of clarity. "GET OUT!" she screamed, lashing out with surprising force,pushing Victoriaaway. "GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!"

Victoria stumbled backward, genuinely shocked. "Sophie, please, calm
down. It's me! Your best friend!"

"Best friend?" Sophie spat, her voice raw. "Friend? THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT! ALL OF IT! GET OUT!"

Victoria looked utterly lost, turning helplessly toward Anna. "I don't understand. What happened?"

Anna stepped forward, her expression carefully controlled. "Victoria,maybe you should go. The guests are probably wondering what's happening, and it's still your birthday party. I'Il take care of Sophie."

"But she's my friend," Victoria protested weakly. "I can't just-"

"Victoria," Anna cut in firmly. "Go. Deal with your guests. This is still salvageable, but not if everyone starts gossiping. Sophie needs space right now, and you need to manage damage control downstairs."

Victoria hesitated, glancing between Sophie's sobbing form and the door."Okay," she finally conceded. "Take care of her. I'll handle things downstairs."


As Victoria left, I lingered by the doorway long enough to hear Anna's gentle voice.

"Sophie, it's okay. Let it out. Just cry if you need to."

Sophie's sobs intensified. "Why? Why me? What did I ever do to deserve this?"

"Sophie," Anna asked carefully, "what exactly happened? How did you end up here? Weren't you supposed,to be watching Charles Windsor?"

Sophie let out a bitter laugh. "Watching him? Victoria told me to keep him
company, to make sure he drank the drugged champagne. But she didn't warn me what kind of man Charles Windsor is!"

I slipped away, not needing to hear more. I already knew the story:Victoria had intended for me to be in Sophie's place, with Charles Windsor as my supposed "companion" when the door was dramatically thrown open. A convenient scandal to destroy my reputation once and for all.

But Victoria had clearly underestimated everyone involved-me, Anna,and especially Charles Windsor.

The ballroom atmosphere had shifted dramatically by the time I returned.Guests clustered in tight groups, whispering behind champagne flutes while darting glances toward the entrance.


I went to find Victoria.

"Summer," she said tightly, approaching me with stiff steps.

"Victoría," I replied calmly. "You look upset. That's a shame-it is your birthday, after all. I can't imagine what could possibly ruin such a perfectly planned evening."

Her eyes flashed with barely contained fury. "Don't. Don't you dare."

"Don't what?" I asked innocently. "Express concern for my sister on her specíal day? Or sympathize that your best friend appears to have gotten herself into quite a situation upstairs? It must be difficult, having your birthday celebration marred by such an unfortunate incident."

Victoría's fingers curled into fists at her sides. "You... you have no idea what I'm going through right now."

"Actually, I think I do," I replied, my voice hardening. "You're upset that
your carefully orchestrated plan backfired spectacularly. You're devastated that instead of me being humiliated tonight, it was your friend Sophie who got caught in your trap."

Victoria's face contorted, awar between denial and rage playing across her features. "You don't know what you're talking about. I never-"

"Come on, Victoria," I cut in, dropping all pretense. "I know you drugged my champagne tonight. Did you honestly think I wouldn't realize? Your little tricks are getting predictable. Drugging people seems to be your go-to move these days."


"You-" Victoria spluttered, her voice dropping to a furious hiss. "You knew? You knew all along?"

I nodded, a cold smile playing on my lips. "You reap what you sow."

Victoria's face twisted with hatred. "You bitch," she snarled,forgetting herself entirely. "You knew what was going to happen and you just let Sophie-"

"Well,well,what do we have here?"

Charles Windsor's smooth voice cut though our confrontation like a blade.
###Chapter 159: Saving You Once Again

**Summer's POV**

Victoria's face had gone ashen, her perfectly manicured hand trembling as she clutched her champagne flute. Her eyes darted frantically between Charles Windsor's smug expression and my calm demeanor, the realization dawning that her carefully orchestrated plan had completely fallen apart.

"Windsor... Mr. Windsor?" Victoria stammered, her voice higher than usual. "How are you here? I thought I saw you feeling unwell and going to rest earlier?"

Charles's smile was all teeth, predatory and knowing. "Yes, I was feeling a bit tipsy, wasn't I? Your dear friend was kind enough to escort me upstairs." He took a deliberate sip of his fresh champagne. "Quite the helpful young lady,that one."


Victoria's foundation couldn't hide the way the blood drained from her face.


"Miss Taylor," Charles continued, turning toVictoria with mock concern,"are you feeling alright? You look rather pale. Perhaps you should see a doctor? Having such a troubled complexion at your own birthday celebration seems rather... inauspicious, wouldn't you say?"

"You're absolutely right, Mr. Windsor," Victoria managed,her voice barely above a whisper. "I'm not feeling well at all. If you'll excuse me-"

She didn't finish her sentence, just turned and practically fled, her designer heels clicking desperately against the marble floor.

Charles watched her retreat with the satisfaction of a cat who'd cornered its
prey but decided to let it escape-for now.

"Interesting," he mused, turning his attention fully to me. "She didn't even try to salvage her party. Not very hostess-like of her, is it, Miss Taylor?"

"What do you want, Mr. Windsor?" I asked, maintaining my distance.

His smile widened. "Miss Taylor, I believe we truly are destined to cross paths. Don't you agree?"

"Is that so?" I replied cautiously.

"Indeed." His eyes glittered with amusement. "After all, here I am,saving you once again."

"Saving me?" I echoed, genuinely confused. "You've saved me before?"

Charles laughed, a sound that held no warmth. "How heartless of you.Have you truly forgotten your rescuer so easily?"


"Cut the crap," I said, "I appreciate whatever assistance you provided today.But let's be honest-you were helping yourself just as much as you were helping me. And frankly, I would have been fine either way." I thought of poor Sophie upstairs and couldn't keep the edge from my voice. "What happened to Sophie, though... that shouldn't have happened to anyone."

Something flashed in Charles's eyes-not anger, but something colder,more calculating.

Before he could respond, my phone rang. Brandon's name lit up the screen, and I couldn't help the wave of relief that washed over me.

"Hello?" I answered,stepping away from Charles.

"Is it over?" Brandon's deep voice came through, instantly soothing my
frayed nerves.

"Yeah." I said, feeling a genuine smile spread across my face.

"I'm outside," he replied simply. "Come out."

"You're here?" I couldn't hide my delight. "Okay, I'll be right there."

I turned back to Charles. "I apologize, Mr. Windsor, but it's getting late.I need to go."




The cool night air hit my face as I pushed through the hotel's revolving door. I spotted Dr. Sean leaning against a black Range Rover,his usual smirk firmly in place.

"Whatare you doing here?" I asked, unable to hide my disappointment.

Sean clutched his chest dramatically. "Why, Mrs. Stark, you wound me! Is that any way to greet your knight in shining armor?"

I glanced over my shoulder to see Charles Windsor exiting the hotel behind me. "Why is he following us out?"

"Who cares?" Sean replied, opening the car door. "Get in."

I slid into the backseat. Brandon sat on the far side, his dark eyes immediately finding mine.

"Brandon!" I couldn't keep the relief from my voice.

"Seatbelt," he reminded me quietly, his hand already reaching to help secure it.
"What are you both doing here?" I asked, glancing between Brandon and Sean as the car pulled away. "Oh-Sean,you're still playing Michael Sullivan tonight?"

"Yep," Sean sighed dramatically. "I've completely lost my identity these days. Forced to live under someone else's name. The tragedy of it all!"

I couldn't help laughing despite the evening's tension.

The city lights streaked past as we drove in silence. I found myself replaying the events of the evening-Victoria's shocked face, Sophie's drugged state, Charles Windsor's cryptic comments.

"You're awfully quiet," Sean observed. "Normally you'd be talking our ears off by now."

I sighed. "I don't know what to say."

Brandon's warm hand covered mine. "YouI're cold," he observed,concern evident in his voice. Then, to Sean: "Turn up the heat."

"Yes, sir," Sean replied, fiddling with the climate controls.

Brandon's eyes studied my face. "You should have worn something warmer. The temperature dropssignificantly at night."

"I'm fine," I insisted with a small smile. "I'm not that delicate."

My mind kept returning to the image of Sophie in that hotel room-disheveled, disoriented,betrayed.

"I can't stop thinking about what happened tonight," I finally admitted."Sophie-Victoria's friend-she was..."

"It wasn't you," Brandon said simply, his grip tightening on my hand."
That's what matters."

I turned to him, surprised. "How did you know what I was going to say?Did you know what was happening upstairs?"

Sean chuckled from the front seat. "Of course we did, Summer! Brandon and I were monitoring the situation from downstairs the whole time."

"You had people watching me?" I asked, staring at Brandon.


"I wasn't going to let you walk into that party unprotected," Brandon confirmed, his expression serious.

"Thank you, Brandon," I whispered.

Sean twisted around in his seat. "So, what are we going to do about this?Those women were planning to drug and humiliate her. That deserves some kind of response, doesn't it?"


I took a deep breath, something shifting inside me. "Sean's right. Victoria crossed a line, and I'm not some saint who can turn the other cheek when someone tries to destroy me." I looked directly at Brandon.

Brandon studied me for a long moment before nodding. "Good."

"Don't worry," I continued, feeling a new resolve. "I'm not that weak,vulnerable Summer anymore. I've grown stronger. I don't want you having to handle everything for me."

"I don't mind," Brandon replied simply.

"I know," I said softly, squeezing his hand. "And that means everything."

As the car turned onto the highway, I gazed out at the twinkling city lights.
"I wonder how Sophie's doing now," I murmured, more to myself than anyone else.

Despite everything, I couldn't help feeling a twinge of sympathy for the poor girl.
###Chapter 160: Things Get Out of Hand

**Anna's POV**

I guided Sophie through the place's back exit, my arm wrapped protectively around her trembling shoulders. The cool night air hit us as we emerged into the dimly lit service alley where I'd parked my car.

"Just a few more steps," I whispered, trying to keep my voice gentle despite the urgency I felt. "My car's right over there."

Sophie stumbled, nearly collapsing against my side. "I can't... I feel like I'm going to be sick again."

As I helped Sophie into the passenger seat, I couldn't shakethe guilt gnawing at me. We had severely underestimated Charles Windsor's depravity, and now Sophie was paying the price.

Once inside the car, I turned to her. She sat huddled against the door,arms wrapped tightly around herself as if trying to disappear.

"Sophie, are you okay?" I asked, reaching over to touch her arm. She flinched. "If you're feeling unwell, you need to tell me."

Her head snapped up, eyes wild and desperate. "Pills. We need to go to a pharmacy.I need the morning-after pill! Right now!"

"Okay, okay," I nodded, starting the car. "We'll go to CVS. I'll get you whatever you need."

"I need to shower," she continued, her voice rising hysterically as she clawed at her arms. "Anna, I need to shower! I can feel them all over me.Their smell is everywhere!"
I grabbed her hands to stop her from scratching herself. "Alright, Sophie,calm down. I'll get you to CVS for the pills, then I'Il take you somewhere safe where you can shower.Just breathe,okay?"

"I can't go home," Sophie said, her voice breaking. "Absolutely not. If my parents find out what happened, they'll kill me! Anna, what am I going to do? Oh my God, what am I going to do!"

She collapsed against me, her body wracked with sobs. I awkwardly patted her back, trying to provide what little comfort I could.

"Why?" she wailed, pulling back to look at me with mascara streaming down her face. "Why would they do this to me?"

"Sophie, please try to calm down," I said, squeezing her hand. "We'll get your medication first, then I'll take you to a hotel. I'll stay with you the whole time. I won't leave you alone."

She clutched my arm desperately. "Anna, please don't leave me. You're all I have right now."

"I won't leave you," I promised,starting the car. "I swear."

In the lavish bathroom of the hotel we checked into, Sophie stood under the shower, scrubbing her skin raw. Steam filled the room as I waited anxiously outside.

"Sophie?" I called through the door. "Sophie, you've been in there for almost an hour. Are you okay?"
"Sophie! Stop!" I rushed forward, yanking open the shower door and reaching for the faucet. The water was scalding hot. "Jesus Christ!"

She fought me, trying to turn the water back on. "No! I'm not clean yet! I can still feel them!"

"Sophie, enough!" I grabbed her wrists, pulling her out of the shower. "You're hurting yourself! Look at your skin!"

She collapsed against me, sobbing uncontrollably as I wrapped her in a plush hotel bathrobe. "I just want to feel clean again," she whispered.

Back in the hotel room, I gently toweled Sophie's hair, careful not to make any sudden movements.


Suddenly, she grabbed my arm, her nails digging into my skin. "Anna, this is all Victoria's fault! All of it! I was raped, your face was disfigured,and she gets to walk away unscathed? All because she's jealous of Summer and wanted revenge. Why are we paying the price for her war?"


My hand drifted unconsciously to the scars on my face, my expression darkening. "Victoria said she feels guilty too. She didn't expect things to turn out like this!"


Sophie let out a bitter laugh. "Guilty? Don't be ridiculous! Don't you remember how she reacted when security dragged you away at Manhattan Club? She didn't give a damn whether you lived or died! How could she possibly feel guilty? She's even disgusted that your face got ruined. If you hadn't reached out to her, she wouldn't have-"

She caught herself mid-sentence, seeing the hurt on my face. She quickly grabbed my hands. "I'm sorry, Anna, I didn't mean to-"

"It's okay," I said, wrapping my arms around her. "Don't worry about any
of that right now. Just rest. I'll stay with you."

"Anna, I can't accept this," Sophie whispered, her body still trembling. "I really can't. All these years of fighting between Victoria and Summer-what does it have to do with us? Why are we the ones suffering all the consequences?"

I stayed silent. I'd long seen through Victoria's self-serving nature. I was surprised, though, that Sophie's anger was directed at Victoria rather than Summer.


"Anna, don't you hate her?" Sophie pressed, pulling back to look at my scarred face. "Your face is like this because of her, you-"

"Sophie, stop," I interrupted firmly. "My face will heal eventually. Right now, what matters is you, and-"

"I'm going to report them!" she exclaimed, her eyes wild with sudden determination. "I'm going to have them arrested! I'm going to report them!"

Just as quickly, her resolve crumbled1. "No, I can't go to the police. If I do,everyone will know what happened. Anna, what am I going to do?"

I pulled her close, strøking her damp hair. "Sophie, calm down. Don't worry. Alexander has taken care of everything. Those people won't say anything. No one else will knowv about tonight. If you want to go to the police, I'll support you."

"No, no police," she said frantically. "Going to the police means everyone will find out. I can't handle that!"

She looked up at me, vulnerable, "Anna, do you think less of me now?"

"Of course not! I never would. None of this is your fault, Sophie. If you
don't want to go to the police, we won't. When I was taking you out,I asked Victoria. She said not to worry, that she'd handle everything and make it right for you."

Sophie's laugh was hollow, her eyes darkening. "Make it right? What could she possibly do to make this right? Will it restore my dignity?"

She gripped my hands tightly, her voice dropping to a vengeful whisper."T m not letting this go, Anna. Everything I suffered tonight-I'm going to make sure Victoria feels the same pain."

I wrapped my arms around her, gently guiding her to lie down. "Sophie,get some sleep. Don't think about anything right now. You'll feel better after some rest."

The following day, the bomb dropped.

Despite Victoria and Alexander's frantic efforts to contain the situation, the truth came out in the worst possible way. The paparazzi Victoria had hired to capture Summer's "scandal" had taken matters into their own hands.


The very next day, a blurred but recognizable video of the incident exploded online. Though faces were pixelated, internet sleuths quickly identified everyone involved.

I stared at my phone in disbelief before furiously dialing Victoria's number.

"Victoria, what the hell is going on?" I demanded. "You said all the videos were deleted! You promised nobody would talk about last night! What is this? Sophie's completely falling apart. I barely managed to calm her down yesterday, and now this? Do you have any idea what you've done? The paparazzi have already found our hotel. There are reporters everywhere!
Victoria, how could you do this?"
###Chapter 161:Please Save My Friend

**Anna's POV**

Victoria's voice came through shakily. "Anna, listen to me. I had nothing to do with this, I swear. I just found out myself. I don't know why they would-"


Sophie snatched the phone from my hand, her entire body trembling with rage.


"You don't know?" she spat, voice raw from crying all night. "Is that how you treat me, Victoria? Anna and I have done everything for you, and when shit hits the fan, you abandon us. Now my photos and videos are all over the internet, and you expect me to believe you? How am I supposed to trust you after this?"

I watched Sophie's face contort with pain as Victoria's voice grew defensive.

"Sophie, listen to me," Victoria pleaded. "This wasn't my fault, I never meant for things to go this way. It's all Summer's fault, that bitch! This was supposed to happen to her, not you. It's all because of her!"

Sophie's laugh was hollow, her eyes dead. "Enough, Victoria. WNhy should Anna and I pay the price for your vendetta against your sister? I swear to God, Victoria, if you don't fix this, I'm going public with everything-how you planned to drug Summer, how you set this whole thing up."

She hurled the phone across the room and collapsed against me,her body wracked with sobs.

"Anna, what am I going to do?" she wailed, clinging to me like I was her only lifeline. "I hate her so much! Why couldn't it have been Victoria?
Why wasn't it her?"

I held her tightly, my own tears falling as I stroked her hair. "Don't cry,Sophie. I'm right here with you!"

My heart was torn between hatred for Victoria and drowning guilt over Sophie. I should have protected her too.

Thirty minutes later, I slipped out while Sophie finally slept and called my brother. When I checked the window again, the swarm of reporters had mysteriously vanished. A soft knock came at the door.

I opened it to find Joe standing there, his face grim but composed.I practically collapsed into his arms.

"Joe,you're finally here!" I sobbed against his chest.

"Where's your friend?" he asked, getting straight to business.

The bedroom door opened. Sophie stood frozen in the doorway, her eyes widening in recognition and fear when she saw Joe. She immediately slammed the door shut.


I hurried over, knocking gently. "Sophie, don't be afraid. This is my brother,Joe Watson. You've met him before. He's here to help us.Joe says all those reporters outside are gone now. No one knows we're here, I promise."

The door cracked open. Sophie peered out, studying Joe with the terrified caution of a wounded animal. "Mr. Watson," she whispered.

Joe nodded once. "Don't worry, everyone outside has left. My car is waiting at the back entrance. No one will see us leave."
"Thank you,Mr. Watson," Sophie said, relief flooding her exhausted face.

"No need to thank me," Joe replied with unexpected gentleness. "You're Anna's friend."

He shrugged off his coat and held it out to her. "Put this on1.We need to leave quickly. I've only managed to divert their attention temporarily-they could figure it out and come back."

"You heard him, Sophie," I urged. "Put on my brother's coat.Let's go!"

In Joe's car, Sophie kept glancing nervously over her shoulder, as if expecting to see a convoy of paparazzi in pursuit.

"Sophie," I said gently, "should we take you home? Your parents must be worried."


Her head snapped toward me, her eyes wide with panic. "No! Please, no!Anna, can I stay with you? My parents will literally kill me if I go home now. They'll kill me!"

I looked helplessly at Joe. "Joe..."

Joe kept his eyes on the road. "We can go to my place in the suburbs for now. That's a quiet place."

"That sounds good," I agreed, turning back to Sophie. "Running away isn't a permanent solution, Sophie. We'll figure this out, I promise. You can rest at my brother's place for a few days, but eventually, you'll need to face your parents."

Sophie nodded, tears spilling dqwn her cheeks. "I know. Thank you, Anna.Whatever you need in the future, I swear I'll be there for you. No questions asked."
After settling Sophie in the villa, Joe and I returned to the car. The moment the doors closed, I felt everything crash down on me again.

"This isn't your fault, Anna," Joe said, starting the engine. "It was an accident,beyond your control."

I shook my head, unable toaccept his comfort. "This is my fault. I was so focused on keeping Summer safe that I completely forgot about how dangerous Charles Windsor is. I never imagined he would do something like this to Sophie!"

"Even if you had been watching Sophie," Joe responded, his voice firm but kind. "You can't control everything. Stay away from Victoria from now on. She's poison. First it was you, now Sophie-who knows who she'll destroy next time?"

"I know," I agreed quietly.

After a moment, I suddenly noticed we weren't on the familiar route home."Wait, this isn't the way to our house!"

"No, it's not," Joe confirmed. "I'm taking you to see Brandon Stark."

My stomach dropped. "Brandon Stark? Please don't!"

Ever since discovering that Summer was Brandon Stark's wife, I'd been terrified of her by association. I'd experienced Brandon Stark's methods firsthand. The scars on my face were a constant reminder.

"Don't worry," Joe assured me. "You saved Summer this time. He won't hurt you."

"But-"
"Trust me, Anna. We might need his help with Sophie's situation anyway.You don't want her hiding in that villa forever, do you? Listen to me on this one."

Manhattan Club-the place where my nightmare had begun. My palms were sweating as we walked through those elegant doors. Joe kept a firm grip on my hand.

"Don't be afraid," he murmured.

James led us through a labyrinth of corridors to a private room. When the door opened, I was surprised to see Brandon Stark casually playing cards with Dr.Sean Sullivan.


"Well, look who's here!" Dr. Sean said cheerfully.

"Mr. Stark, Mr. Sullivan," my brother greeted them respectfully.

I couldn't help my surprise. "Dr. Sean? Aren't you..."

Dr. Sean gave me a curious look. "Do you know me,Miss Watson?"

"No!" I replied quickly.

Dr. Sean turned to Brandon with a smirk. "Brandon, our guests have arrived. Aren't you going to say something?"

Brandon Stark gestured toward the empty chairs. "Mr. Watson, Miss Watson, please make yourselves comfortable."

Joe nodded gratefully. "Thank you, Brandon. May I ask why you wanted to see my sister?"

Brandon's penetrating gaze settled on me. "About last night. Miss Watson.you did well. Summer and I owe you a favor."
I swallowed hard, hardly believing my ears. "I don't deserve your thanks,Mr. Stark. I'm truly sorry for what I did to your wife before. I promise it will never happen again. What I did last night was my way of making amends."

"When I say I owe someone a favor," Brandon replied, his voice measured,"I always repay it."

"Anna," Joe prompted, nudging me. "Thank Mr. Stark."

"Thank you, Mr. Stark!" I blurtedI out, then hesitated before gathering my courage. "Mr. Stark, could I... could I ask you for a favor now?"

Brandon's expression remained inscrutable. "Go ahead, Miss Watson."

Joe nodded encouragingly, and I took a deep breath. "My friend, my friend Sophie... she's in trouble. Could you... could you please help her?"
###Chapter 162: Can We Keep him? Please?

**Brandon's POV**

I allowed my lips to curve into a slight smile, twirling a playing card between myfingers as I finally fixed my gaze directly on Anna.

"Miss Watson," I said, my voice cutting through the silence, "have you thought this through? My favors don't come easy. While I did say I'd repay your help, are you certain you want to waste this opportunity on someone who isn't even family?"


Anna drew in a sharp breath but maintained her composure. "Mr. Stark,Sophie might be nothing to you, but she's my friend. I understand that Sophie and I deserve punishment for what we did to Summer with Victoria. But haven't we both suffered enough?" Her voice trembled slightly. "Summer is fine now, isn't she?"

"That doesn't erase what you intended. If luck hadn't been on her side,what happened to you and your friend yesterday would have been Summer's fate. Don't you agree?" I replied, my voice cooling.

Anna fell silent, her expression confirming she knew I was right.Her hands trembled, but her determination remained steadfast.

"Mr. Stark, please," she finally continued, desperation bleeding into her voice. "Sophie told me herself that she hates Victoria now.She sees everything clearly."

That caught my interest. "She told you this herself?"

Anna nodded quickly. "Yes. She understands that we were just pawns in Victoría's vendetta against Summer. After what happened, Sophie hates
Victoria just as much as I do." Her voice grew more urgent. "Mr. Stark,please-if you help Sophie this once, we'll help Summer if Victoria ever comes after her again. Whatever you want us to do, we'll doit."

I raised my hand, cutting off her desperate plea. "You can go now."

"Mr. Stark!" Anna protested, clearly not satisfied with my response.

I glanced at Joe Watson, who immediately understood. He stood, taking his sister's arm. "Mr. Stark has agreed. Let's go,Anna."

As they reached the door, Anna stopped and turned back to me. "Mr.Stark, can I ask you one question?"

I raised an eyebrow. "Go ahead."

"What happened to Sophie... was it your doing?"

The fear was evident in her voice as she asked this. She had no way to gauge my character or where my boundaries lay.


I set down my cards,my fingers tapping rhythmically against the polished table. "What do you think?"

Anna shook her head. "I don't know."

She and Joe waited, the tension in the room thick enough to cut with a knife. After what seemed like an eternity, I finally answered, my voice carrying a cold, unmistakable threat: "If it had been me, she would be in much worse condition."

Anna's face drained of color. She stumbled backward, and Joe quickly steadied her before she could fall. Without another word,they left,clearly shaken by the encounter.
The moment the door closed, Sean leaned back in his chair, a smirk playing on his lips.

"Brandon, you've really perfected the art of terrifying people," he remarked.

I looked up, giving him a sidelong glance. "Would you like a personal demonstration?"


Sean's expression immediately shifted, his eyebrows shooting up. "I'll pass,thanks. I don't need that kind of special treatment." He shuffled the cards absently. "But this whole situation is fascinating. Who would have thought someone would beat you to the punch?"

I narrowed my eyes slightly. "His move wasn't unexpected."


Sean shook his head in mock amazement. "Charles Windsor certainly is more decisive than his brother, isn't he?"

I gave Sean a flat look. "He's impatient."

Sean couldn't help but smirk at my assessment. Charles Windsor-the man everyone underestimated because of his playboy image. Behind that careless facade was a calculating mind almost as ruthless as mine. His action against Sophie served multiple purposes: a warning to both the Windsor and Taylor families, while reinforcing his carefully crafted public persona.

"Anyway," Sean said,glancing at his watch, "it's getting late."

"Indeed," I agreed, standing and reaching for my coat. "I should head back.You're coming with me to pick up Max."

Sean's expression immediately turned to one of alarm. "No way! I can't right now!"
I stepped in front of him before he could make his escape. "Take. Him.With. You." Max's presence at the Hamptons estate had become a significant intrusion on my private time with June.

"You can't be serious," Sean protested. "Don't pretend I don't know what this is about. You're just annoyed that Max is interfering with your marital bliss! He's just a dog-and technically, he'syour dog!"

"If you already know he's interfering with my wife and me, why won't you take him?" I countered, my patience wearing thin.

"Fine," he muttered, dabbing at his split lip. "III take the damn dog."

James, who had entered during our conversation, cleared his throat discreetly. Sean glanced at him, rubbing his bruised jaw.

"Dr. Sullivan," James said, his voice professionally neutral despite the hint of amusement in his eyes, "you may not be aware, but Mr. Stark has already arranged for an internationally renowned plastic surgeon to consult with Miss Watson."

Sean's eyes widened in realization. "That Watson girl's face was pretty...jarring," he admitted. For a woman like Anna, whose beauty had been her currency, those scars were more than just physical wounds.

"A small gesture," I said dismissively. "Nothing worth mentioning."

By the time we reached the Hamptons estate, it was already late. June was waiting in the living room, curled up on the sofa with a book, her reading glasses perched on the bridge of her nose.

"There you are," she said, looking up with a smile that instantly made the day's tension melt away.
Then she noticed Sean behind me and raised an eyebrow. "Dr. Sean? What are you doing here?"


"Taking Max back," I answered before Sean could open his mouth.

Max,sensing something was happening, trotted over from his cushion near the fireplace. His ears perked up when he saw Sean, but instead of going to him. the dog pressed against June's legs, looking up at her with those manipulatively adoring eyes.

"Wait, what?" June set her book aside, her hand automatically dropping to scratch behind Max's ears. "You're taking him tonight?"

"That's the plan," Sean confirmed, not looking particularly thrilled about it.


When Sean finally managed to clip the leash onto Max's collar and lead him toward the door, the dog began to whine, his nails scrabbling against the hardwood floor in resistance.

"Come on, buddy," Sean coaxed, tugging gently. "It's time to go home.”

Max looked back at June, his soulful eyes filled with what could only be described as heartbreak. He let out a low, mournful howl that made June visibly wince.

"Wait!" she called out, her voice cracking slightly as Max began pawing desperately at the door once Sean had managed to get him outside.

June turned to me, her eyes wide and pleading. "We can't just send him away like this. I mean,look at him!"

Through the glass panel beside the door, we could see Max staring back at us,his face the picture of canine misery.
"I told you, he's manipulating you," I said, but even I had to admit the display was effective.

"Brandon," June said softly, her hand finding mine. "Can we keep him?Please?"
###Chapter 163: The Four of Them

**Summer's POV**

Brandon stood beside me, arms crossed, expression unreadable. He glanced at the dog, then suddenly turned to me.

"Me or Max. Choose one," he said flatly.

My jaw dropped. *Was he serious?*

"What the-" Sean sputtered, looking utterly betrayed. "Brandon, that's low, even for you! You're seriously comparing yourself to a dog?"


Before I could even formulate a response, Sean grabbed Max's leash and stormed toward his car. "Come on, Max. Let's go where we're appreciated."

"Wow, really smooth," I said, turning to Brandon with my hands on my hips once Sean's car disappeared down the driveway. "Did you have to do that?"


Brandon's face softened as he stepped closer, his fingers brushing against my cheek.

I tried to maintain my disapproving expression, but I could feel my resolve crumbling. "Fine..." I managed weakly as he pulled me inside.

Later that morning, I was curled up on the couch with a book when I heard Brandon's voice from his study. He was on the phone,speaking in that authoritative tone he used for business matters. I wouldn't have paid much attention, except that a familiar name caught my ear.

"The video situation with Sophie needs to be contained immediately," he was saying. "James, handle it personally."
When he hung up and emerged from the study, I couldn't help bout ask,"Sophie? Why are you talking about Sophie?"

Brandon settled beside me on the couch, his hand automatically finding mine. "Anna saved you," he explained simply. "I owe her a favor, so I'm repaying it."

"What are you planning to do?" I asked, genuinely curious.

"I've already put James on it," he replied. "When the video was leaked,everyone's faces were blurred. People are speculating, but there's no definitive proof of identities. Sophie doesn't want to press charges."


I nodded, understanding completely. "I get why she wouldn't. If she does,the whole thing will never go away. Not only would those men and their families face consequences, but Sophie and her family would never know peace either. The media would have a field day with it. That would be devastating for her."

Brandon's expression remained neutral. "I'll use my connections to scrub the video from circulation. It's not a difficult problem to solve." He paused,studying my face. "She helped set a trap for you. Don't you hate her?"

I sighed,feeling the complex emotions wash over me. "Of course I hate what she did. But she's suffering now, and she's a victim too. Victoria was the real mastermind. Well, do you think I'm too soft-hearted?"

"No," Brandon said, pressing a gentle kiss to my forehead. "That's called being kind."

He stood up, extending his hand to me."Come on, go upstairs and change.I'm taking you out."

I took his hand, looking at him curiously. "Now? Where are we going?"
"The stables," he replied with a hint of a smile. "Didn't you mention wanting to go horseback riding?"

My eyes widened with excitement. "You actually remembered that? I'm heading up to change right now!"

"Go ahead," he nodded. "I'll wait for you."


I practically sprinted upstairs, digging through my closet for appropriate riding clothes. I foundd a pair of fitted riding pants and a light breathable top. quickly changing and applying sunscreen. When I rushed back downstairs, Brandon was still in his business casual attire.

"Wait for me." he called, eyeing my outfit. "I should change too."

"Of course!" I grinned. "Hey, why don't you wear that light gray athletic set I bought you when we went shopping? I bet you'd look amazing in it."

"Alright," he agreed, heading upstairs.

Half an hour later, we were ready to leave. Brandon made a quick call to James, arranging for security to meet us at the stables. I couldn't help but smile at his constant precautions, though I'd come to understand they were simply part of his nature.

When we arrived at the stables, I immediately spotted the security personnel James had dispatched. They maintained a discreet distance,professional and alert. What I hadn't expected to see were the two familiar figures leaning against a sleek black car-Dr. Sean and another man I didn't recognize but had a strong feeling about.

Brandon's eyebrow arched slíghtly as we approached. "What are you doing here?"
"Can you believe this guy?" Sean exclaimed,gesturing dramatically toward Brandon while looking at me. "I literally just took Max off your hands,and here you are sneaking off to the stables with Mrs. Stark! The betrayal!"

He turned to me with a grin. "Mrs. Stark, we meet again!"

"What a coincidence," I replied with an amused smile.

"Quite the coincidenceindeed," Sean agreed, his tone suggesting it was anything but.


Brandon placed his hand on my lower back, guiding me forward. "June,this is Edward Lee."


So this was the famous Edward Lee-another member of the Wall Street Four. I extended my hand. "It's nice to meet you, Mr.Lee."


Edward took my hand with a firm, confident grip. "The pleasure is mine. I've heard you and Brandon got married. I haven't had the opportunity to offer my congratulations in person until now. When you two hold your wedding ceremony, I'll be sure to bring an appropriate gift."

"Thank you,Mr. Lee," I replied politely.

Sean jumped in immediately. "Come on, Mrs. Stark, there's no need to be so formal! Just call him Edward, or Ed even.Right,Ed?"

Edward shot Sean a sharp look that could have cut glass before turning back to me with a composed expression. "Please call me Edward."

"Edward it is," I nodded, then looked back at Brandon curiously. "You guys are called the Wall Street Four, right? Where's the fourth member?"

"Ah, that one," Sean said with a knowing grin. "He is quite the elusive
character-here one day, gone the next. But don't worry, Mrs. Stark,you'll definitely meet him eventually. He made a promise that he'd show up when Brandon finally got married."


I glanced at Brandon questioningly, noticing a subtle tension in his posture.


"He's busy and rarely in New York these days," Brandon explained smoothly. "You probably won't meet him anytime soon, but he'll definitely be there when we hold our wedding ceremony."
###Chapter 164: Their Stories

**Summer's POV**

Sean and Edward insisted on joining our "riding adventure." The sprawling property looked like something straight out of a Ralph Lauren advertisement-pristine white fences, meticulously groomed fields,and sleek thoroughbreds grazing in the distance.


"This place is incredible," I breathed, taking in the manicured landscape as we all stepped out of our cars.

Brandon's hand found mine immediately. "Have you ever ridden before?"

"Never," I admitted. "Ruby came here once when we were teenagers. Her parents were trying the whole 'socialite daughter' thing. She nearly got trampled her first day-swore she'd never set foot near a horse again."

I chewed my lip, my earlier excitement now giving way to trepidation as I watched the horses being led around nearby. They were so much... bigger in person.

Brandon reached over, tilting my chin up. "Don't worry. You're perfectly safe with me. The safety measures here are top-notch, and even if you don't trust them-" his thumb brushed my lower lipo"-you can trust me."

"Yeah, that's right," Sean chimed in, sidling up next to us. "And if you don't trust this guy-"

"There's always me and Edward," Sean continued,gesturing to Edward who stood a few steps away. "Edward's riding skills blow your husband's out of thewater. And if Edward fails you, you've still got me, and I'm better than both of them combined!"
I laughed, tension diffusing. "You being better than both of them? No way.I'm absolutely sure Brandon's amazing."

Sean clutched his chest dramatically. "Ouch! Edward, are you seeing this?Brandon's barely been married five minutes and they're already spreading their lovey-dovey vibes everywhere. It's not fair! I don't remember you and Grace being this nauseating when you first got married."

The atmosphere shifted instantly. Edward's relaxed expression darkened,his jaw tightening visibly.


"Shit," Sean muttered. "I'm sorry-that was totally out of line. I know we don't mention her."


When no one responded, Sean threw his hands up. "Come on, guys! I get it-one's her brother, one's her ex-husband. But seriously,Edward,Katniss has been gone for years. Don't you think it's time to move on?"

"What about you?" Edward fired back, voice controlled. "Alice'sbeen gone just as long. Have you moved on?"

The three men stood frozen in a triangle of tension,each nursing old wounds none wanted to discuss. I shifted uncomfortably, feeling like I'd stumbled into a minefield.


"Um, Brandon?" I interjected. "Weren't you going to teach me how to ride today?"

Brandon's expression softened immediately. "You're right. Let's go get you changed, then we'll pick out a horse for you."

He took my hand, leading me away from the standoff.

"Will they be okay?" I whispered. "They seemed ready to tear each other
apart."

"They'll be fine," Brandon assured me.

"Are you sure? Because the way they were looking at each other..." I glanced back. "I was honestly worried they might start throwing punches."

A hint of amusement returned to Brandon's eyes. "Trust me, if anything,those two will team up against me before they'd ever fight each other."

"Really?" I remained skeptical.

"Really," Brandon confirmed. "Edward won't do anything to Sean."

Before we went inside the clubhouse, I asked the question burning in my mind. "Can I ask you something? Katniss... is she the same as your sister,Grace Stark?"


Brandon nodded. "Yes. She's my uncle Gavin's biological daughter.She and Zoey were switched at birth-she grew up with another family. She strongly resembles my aunt, which sparked the investigation."

"What about her and Edward?"

"It's complicated. They were married, but separated due to a misunderstanding. Now no one knows where she is."

"Haven't you tried to find her?"

"Of course we have," Brandon replied softly. "But Katniss is stubborn.Once she makes up her mind, it's nearly impossible to change it. The divorce papers she left for Edward were... final."

"And Edward? Doesn't he want to find her?"
Brandon's eyes met mine. "June, not every relationship gets a happy ending."

His words sent a chill through me. I gripped his hand tighter. "Brandon,promise me something. Promise you'll never abandon me. No matter what happens."


Brandon knew my history-how it felt to be betrayed by someone I trusted completely. The thought of experiencing that devastation again terrified me.

"I won't," he said firmly. "Unless you tell me to go,I'm not going anywhere. I know promises can sound empty. But when I give you my word, I keep it. Always."

I nodded, blinking back tears. "I love you, Brandon."

"I love you too." He leaned forward, pressing a kiss to my forehead,his thumb smoothing the worry line between my brows. "Anything else you want to know?"


I hesitated, then asked, "What about Alice?"

Brandon's eyes darkened, his grip tightening. "She's the other sister I mentioned before-one of the few Stark family members you can trust."

"Alice Stark?" I confirmed.

He nodded. "Her situation is different from Katniss's. She's an illegitimate Stark-a mistake my father made when he was young. She wasn't right for the Stark family. And she wasn't right for Sean,either."

"Did they break up because of a misunderstanding too?"
"No," Brandon stated bluntly. "There was no misunderstanding. They simply weren't in love anymore, weren't meant for each other."

"And where is she now? Did she leave on her own, like Katniss?"

"I'll tell you more about her later," Brandon replied, his tone making it clear the subject was closed. "Just try not to mention Alice around Sean.
He doesn't handle it well."

He opened the door to the changing room. "I have a personal locker room here.James called ahead, so your riding clothes should already be waiting."

I nodded,following him inside and setting aside the mysterious stories of
Katniss and Alice for another time.

The changing room was luxurious-all polished wood and ambient lighting. Brandon retrieved a garment bag.

"Here," he said. "Try these on. Afterward, I'll teach you the basics, then we'Il select a horse for you. Since it's your first time, we'll keep it simple."

I understood then that this outing had been Brandon's way of helping me decompress after Victoria's disastrous birthday party. He'd wanted to give me a peaceful day together, just the two of us.

I emerged from the bathroom minutes later in fitted riding breeches, tall boots, and a crisp white button-down shirt. My hair was pulled into a high ponytail, face bare of makeup, feeling somehow younger and more carefree than I had in months.

Brandon's eyes lit up as they traveled from my face down to my boots and back again. Gone was the políshed professional I showed the world at Stark Group, and in her place stood someone less controlled, more alive.
"Well?" I asked, doing a small twirl. "How do I look?"
###Chapter 165: Brandon and Edward - Who's Better?

**Summer's POV**

Brandon's eyes traveled up my body, lingering just long enough to make heat rise to my cheeks.

"It looks good." he said, his voice dropping low. "Really good."

I fidgeted with the jacket again. "Are you sure?"

"Trust me," he murmured. "You look perfect. Head out first-I'll be right behind you."

"Okay," I nodded, stepping into the bright sunlight where I spotted Edward and Sean already waiting, both impeccably dressed in riding gear.

"Edward, Dr. Sean," I greeted with a small wvave.

Sean immediately clutched his chest in mock offense. "Mrs. Stark, I'm wounded! You call him 'Edward' but I'm still 'Dr. Sean'? After all we've been through?"

I laughed. "Fine, Sean it is."

"That's better!" he grinned, leaning in conspiratorially. "Though I couldn't help but notice you checking us out. If Brandon saw that, he'd be absolutely green with jealousy."

"If Brandon saw what?" came a cool voice from behind me.

Brandon came to stand beside me. His hand found mine automatically.
"Don't mind him," Brandon said, squeezing my hand. "Let's go pick out a horse for you."

As we walked toward the stables, I couldn't help but admire Brandon in his riding gear. The pants hugged his muscular thighs, and his rolled-up sleeves revealed strong forearms.


"Brandon," I said softly, "you're seriously the most gorgeous man I've ever seen."


He glanced down, surprise flickering across his features before a small smile curved his lips. "Is that so?" he asked, giving my hand a gentle squeeze.

Behind us, Sean's voice carried forward. "This is totally unfair. Brandon just abandoned us to go play happy couple with his wife. What exactly are we even doing here?"

"Weren't you the one who insisted on tagging along?" Edward replied dryly. "You brought this on yourself."

Brandon led me to a beautiful chestnut mare with kind eyes. "This is Cinnamon," he said. "She's gentle, perfect for beginners."

The next hour flew by as Brandon patiently taught me the basics. His hands stayed supportively on my waist or alongside mine on the reins,and I found myself relaxing into the rhythm of Cinnamon's gentle gait.

"Brandon, she's so well-behaved!" I exclaimed as we completed a slow circuit.

"She is," he agreed. "Do you want to try on your own? I'll be right here."


I nodded eagerly. "Let's do it!"
As he released his hold, I felt a momentary flutter of panic, followed by exhilaration as I realized I was actually riding by myself.

Suddenly, two riders thundered past on magnificent horses, racing neck and neck. I instantly recognized Sean and Edward, their forms perfect as they leaned low over their mounts.


"Oh my god," I breathed. "Brandon, Edward and Sean are racing. Who do you think will win?"

When Brandon didn't immediately answer, I glanced over. "Brandon?"


"Edward," he replied simply.

"You sound so certain. Is Edward really that good? How does he compare to you?"

Brandon's eyes held a hint of amusement. "Are you asking if I should race them?"


"Could you?" I couldn't hide my excitement.

"I could," he nodded. "But we should check with them first."


"Let's go!" I guided Cinnamon toward the fence.

Brandon studied my face. "You seem more excited about this than I am."


"Of course I am! I want to see my husband show off his skills!"

"And if I lose?" he asked, eyebrow raised.

I shrugged, grinning. "Then you lose! It's not the end of the world."

Just as we reached the fence, Brandon's phone rang. His expression
changed as he looked at the screen.

"I need to take this," he said, stepping away.

When he returned, his face had grown serious. "That was the Stark estate.I need to head back immediately."


"Is everything okay?" I asked, concérn immediately replacing my excitement.


Edward dismounted in one fluid motion. "No race today then?"

"Not today," Brandon confirmed. "Something's come up at the family estate."

He turned to me apologetically. "I'm sorry, but I can'tstay.You'll have to head back without me."

"Don't worry about it," I assured him. "Your family matters are important.You can take me riding anytime."

Edward stepped forward. "If you don't mind, Mrs. Stark, Sean and I could take you to dinner and then drive you home?"

Brandon nodded. "That would be good. I'd feel better knowing you're with them."

"Brandon, I'm a grown woman," I said, touching his arm. "I'd be fine on my own, but company is nice. Go handle your business. Don't worry about me."

After Brandon left, I found myself in Sean's car, with Edward following behind.

"Thank you both for the escort," I said, breaking the silence.
"No need to thank us," Edward replied through Sean's Bluetooth.

Sean glanced at me curiously. "So, Mrs. Stark, aren't you the least bit curious?"


I frowned slightly. "About what?"

"About why Brandon was suddenly called back to the Stark family estate.He hasn't taken you there yet,has he?"

"No, he hasn't," I admitted.

"And doesn't that make you wonder why?"

I straightened in my seat. "Actually, I'm the one who asked to keep our relationship private for now. It was my decision, not Brandon's."

Sean nearly swerved in surprise. "Wait, what? You're the one who doesn't want to go public?"

"Is that so shocking?" I challenged. "You know about my family situation.I don't think it would be good for anyone to know about us right now.The last thing I want is for my family to try using me to get to him. I don't want to bring Brandon any unnecessary trouble."

Sean fell silent, his expression thoughtful. As we drove toward the restaurant, I found myself wondering what exactly was happening at the Stark estate-and why Brandon had been summoned there so urgently.
###Chapter 166: Brandon's Mother

**Brandon's POV**

The Stark family estate came into view as I drove through the wrought iron gates.


The butler was already waitng at the entrance.

"Mr. Stark." he greeted as I stepped out of the car.

"When did my mother get here?" I asked without preamble.

"Mrs. Sinclair arrived on the morning flight from Washington, sir," butler replied, falling into step beside me as I made my way toward the main entrance.

I nodded, processing this information. "And who else is with her?"


"Miss Elle," butler added cautiously, clearly sensing my shift in mood.

I stopped mid-stride, a cold wave of irritation washing over me. Elle Sinclair. Of course she would be here too. The real reason behind this sudden visit was becoming clearer.

"Miss Elle said she was concerned about Mrs. Sinclair traveling alone."butler continued, clearly uncomfortable with my silence.

"I see," I replied, my voice deliberately cool as I resumed walking. The sooner I dealt with this situation, the sooner I could return to June.

The moment I stepped into the grand foyer, Elle Sinclair was rushing toward me, arms outstretched. Her honey-blonde hair was perfectly styled,gleaming like silk in the light, with delicate features complemented by
large eyes and cherry-red lips. Her tailored dress perfectly accentuated her slender figure.

Undeniably, from a purely aesthetic perspective, Elle was the kind of beauty that would make most men stop and stare-but to me, this meticulously crafted beauty only evoked an instinctive aversion, like a flower too perfect to be genuine.


"Brandon!" she exclaimed, moving to embrace me.


I stepped aside smoothly, causing her to stumble slightly as she missed her target. She recovered quickly, turning to face me with a wounded expression that I'd seen too many timnes to count.

"Brandon, you're so mean!" Elle pouted, her voice taking on that familiar wheedling tone. "It's been so long since I've seen you. What if I had fallen?Don't you care?"

"I believe I've made it clear before," I replied evenly, "that I don't appreciate being touched."

Her eyes widened in theatrical hurt. "Brandon!"

I ignored her protest, moving past her toward the main sitting room where I knew my mother would be waiting. Elle trailed behind me, her heels clicking against the marble floors.

Jane Sinclair saton one of the antique sofas, elegant as always in a tasteful cream suit that emphasized her still-youthful figure. Her blonde hair,perfectly maintained, was swept up in a sophisticated chignon. At fifty-three, she remained a striking woman, the kind who turned heads when she entered a room.

She rose as I entered, her practiced smile not quite reaching her eyes."
Brandon."

"Mother," I acknowledged, maintaining a respectful but measured distance.

Elle quickly scurried to Jane's side, darting a wounded glance in my direction as she deliberately positioned herself between us. I shifted slightly to maintain the space I'd established.


"Elle is your sister, Brandon. There's no need for such coldness between siblings." Jane said, her voice carrying that hint of disapproval I'd grown accustomed to over the years.


I remained silent, unwilling to engage with that particular fiction.Elle wasn't my sister-not by blood, not by law, not by any definition that mattered to me.

"Elle, come here." Jane called, patting the space beside her on the sofa.

"Yes, of course!" Elle responded eagerly, taking her seat with obvious pleasure at the attention. She turned toward me with a bright smile. "Brandon's probably juast shy because it's been so long since he's seen me.Isn't that right, Brandon?"

I turned to butler, who hovered discreetly near the doorway. "Where are my grandfather and father?"

"Mr. William Stark is upstairs, sir. Your father and Mr. Gavin are in the study discussing business. Would you like me to inform them of your arrival?"

"That won't be necessary. I'll go up shortly," I replied1. "Please have some tea brought up."

"Right away, sir," butler nodded, clearly relieved to have an excuse to exit
the increasingly tense atmosphere.

I chose a chair positioned strategically far from both Jane and Elle,sitting down and meeting my mother's increasingly irritated gaze directly.


"What brings you back, Mother?" I asked, deliberately keeping my tone neutral.


Jane's perfectly shaped eyebrows arched in displeasure. "This is still my home, isn't it? Do I need your permission to return?"

"Of course not," I replied evenly. "I'm simply curious about the timing of your visit."

The tension between us was palpable, years of unresolved issues hovering just beneath the surface of our polite exchange. Jane's hands,adorned with several tasteful rings but notably missing her wedding band, tensed slightly on her lap.

"Brandon. I am your mother," she said, her voice carrying a note of frustration. "You could at least pretend to be happy to see me."

"I never said I wasn't," I countered smoothly. "How long are you planning to stay? Washington is your home now, after all."

A flash of genuine hurt crossed Jane's features before being quickly masked by indignation. "How dare you speak to me that way? You know why I left back then. None of that was my fault!"

I felt a familiar weariness settle over me. This was why I avoided these encounters whenever possible-they inevitably circled back to the same old grievances, the same tired justifications.

"I have no interest in revisiting ancient history," I said,leaning back
slightly in my chair. "It's been years. What's done is done. Why are you really here,Mother?"


"I'm here to see my son," Jane insisted, her voice rising slightly. "Is that so difficult to believe?"


"You've seen me." I replied, standing up. "I have matters to discuss with Father. If you'll excuse me."

Elle jumped to her feet, moving to intercept me before I could leave."Brandon, please! Aunt Jane misses you. You hardly ever visít us in Washington. She just wanted to see you."

When I didn't respond, her expression grew increasingly desperate."Brandon! What's wrong with you? This is your mother.How can you treat her this way? You weren't always like this."

I fixed her with a cold stare. "This is a Stark family matter. As an outsider,you'd do well to stay out of it."

Jane stood abruptly. "That's enough, Brandon! You can be angry with me.but Elle has done nothing wrong. She is your sister, and I won't have you treating her this way. She came all this way to see you, and you-"

"If my memory serves me correctly," I interrupted,my patience finally exhausted, "she's merely your uncle's adopted daughter. What relation is that to me?"
###Chapter 167: Ruthless

**Brandon's POV**

The oppressive silence in the Stark family living room was thick enough to cut with a knife. Elle Sinclair stood before me, her face a perfect mask of practiced vulnerability-pale, eyes wide and swimming with unshed tears.

"Brandon, I know you're upset, but I don't blame you!" she said, her voice breaking at just the right moment.

I scoffed, giving her a dismissive once-over before turning toward the stairs.The longer I stayed in this room, the more I felt my control slipping.

As I headed for the staircase, Parker, our long-time butler, fell into step beside me.

"Mr. Stark, I've prepared the tea service as requested. Should I-"

"Bring it upstairs," I replied, deliberately softening my tone. "I need to speak with my father and Uncle Gavin."

I felt my mother's gaze burning into my back.

I knocked firmly on the study door before entering. Father and Uncle Gavin looked up from a stack of papers spread across the mahogany desk.

"Brandon!" Uncle Gavin greeted me with genuine warmth, gesturing me over."You made it."

"Yes, Uncle," I replied, moving toward them as Parker quietly entered with the tea service.

I waited until Parker had set up the tea and exited before taking a seat.
With practiced movements, I began preparing the tea, a ritual that had always helped focus my thoughts. Father and Gavin wrapped up their conversation about some investment property in Boston as I methodically measured the leaves.


"You saw your mother?" Father asked, his voice carefully neutral.

I nodded once. "Yes."


"Elle came with her," he added, watching my reaction.

I kept my expression perfectly controlled."I noticed."

Uncle Gavin sighed, giving Father a pointed look. "Brandon's a grown man, Robert. He can handle his own affairs. You don't need to worry."

"You don't understand, Gavin," Father responded, rubbing his temples. "Jane is still bitter about what happened years ago. And now with Elle in the picture..."

He turned to me, his expression softening into something uncomfortably close to pity. "Brandon, it's time you considered settling down. Lyanna is gone-has been for years. You can't keep holding onto her memory forever.



My hand stilled momentarily over the teapot, the mention of her name still carrying a sting I'd never quite mastered. "Do you honestly believe she has any influence over my decisions?" I asked, my voice deliberately cool.

"But Lyanna-"

"Father," I cut him off, "my personal life is not up for dliscussion.You'd be better served focusing on Mother rather than me."
Father sighed heavily, the weight of decades of marital tension evident in the slump of his shoulders. "Your mother is not easily managed, Brandon.The wounds between us run deep. Do you think she came back for me?She has her own agenda, as always."


"Then you understand why this conversation is pointless," I replied evenly."No one-not Lyanna, not Elle, not even Mother-can force my hand in anything."


"But your mother-"

"Her place is at Washington," I stated flatly. "If she prefers it there,she should stay there. Her absence from New York would be a welcome development."

A noise outside the door caught my attention. I rose from my chair and crossed the room in a few swift strides, pulling the door open without warning.

Mother and Elle stood frozen in the hallway, their expressions confirming they'd heard every word. Mother's face was ashen with shock, while Elle looked like she'd been slapped.

"Brandon," Mother gasped, "you..."

"Do you really hate me that much?" Elle whispered, tears now streaming freely down her cheeks.

I felt my control-always so carefully maintained-begin to slip. The temperature in the hallway seemed to drop as I stared them down,letting my mask fall away completely.

Elle reached for my arm, her fingers closing around my wrist. "Brandon.you know how I feel about you. How can you say such things? You and I..
.that time in Washington, you clearly-"

"Get off me," I snarled, yanking my arm from her grasp with enough force to make her stumble backward.


I turned on her, all pretense of civility abandoned. "You're not Sinclair blood, but I assumed years of proper upbringing would have instilled some dignity in you. Clearly, I was mistaken. No matter how much gold plating you apply, you're just like your mother underneath-worthless."


I shifted my gaze to my mother, whose face had gone from pale to crimson."The great Sinclair heiress, and this is the best you could do with your precious ward? You'd rather embrace someone like Elle than acknowledge Alice. Perhaps you should return to the Sinclair estate permanently. Don't bother coming back to New York."

The crack of her palm against my cheek echoed in the hallway. "How dare you!" she hissed, trembling with rage. "I am your mother! Your father was the one who betrayed me, not the other way around!"

I met her gaze unflinchingly, unmoved by the blow. "Is that so? Do you truly believe I'm still that naive child who doesn't know what really happened?"

She took two involuntary steps backward, something like fear flickering across her face.

"I'm not Father," I continued coldly. "My tolerance has limits. Stay out of my personal affairs-especially my marriage. If you insist on interfering.you won't like the consequences."

I brushed past them both, my footsteps echoing in the silent hallway. At the top of the stairs, I found my grandfather,William Stark,leaning
heavily on his cane.

"Grandfather," I greeted him, my tone immediately warming.

"Brandon," he replied, studying me with shrewd eyes that belied his eighty years. "When did you arrive?"


"Just now. I was speaking with Father and Uncle Gavin about some business matters."


He nodded, satisfied with the explanation. "It's been too long since I've seen you. Stay for dinner tonight."

"Of course," I agreed, offering my arm. "Let me help you downstairs."

As I assisted Grandfather down the stairs, I could feel Mother's gaze burning into my back from the doorway of the study. The fury radiating from her was almost palpable, but I found I didn't care. She had made her choices long ago, and I had made mine.
###Chapter 168: The Rift Between Mother and Son

**Brandon's POV**

The dinner hour at the Stark estate approached as I stood in the living room,checking my watch. Father and Uncle Gavin spoke in hushed tones across the room, while Maeve, Gavin's wife sat nearby, her frame more fragile than I remembered.


Heels clicked against marble as Mother descended the staircase with Elle supporting her-an unnecessary gesture that reeked of performance. The seating arrangement spoke volumes: Grandfather at the head,me directly opposite, Uncle Gavin and Aunt Maeve together, and two empty chairs beside Father for Mother and Elle.

"Shall we begin?" Grandfather asked as the butler helped him to his seat.

"My my, look at you two," Mother said, her gaze lingering on Uncle Gavin and Aunt Maeve with thinly veiled contempt. "Still joined at the hip after all these years. Tell me, Gavin, is it devotion or guilt that keeps you chained to her bedside? Playing the dutiful husband must be so...exhausting."

Uncle Gavin's fingers paused over his silverware, his eyes turning cold.

Aunt Maeve offered a thin smile. "Oh my, Jane. Still dressing to turn heads at your age? I'm sure that neither of us needs to rely on plunging necklines to keep our husbands interested."

Mother's knuckles whitened around her fork as she took her seat beside Father, the barb about her revealing outfit hitting its mark
The tension was disrupted by Sarah's arrival with Angela,whose face lit up when she spotted me.

"Uncle Brandon!" Angela squealed. "Up! Up!"

I rose immediately to take her from Sarah. "Hello, princess," I said, lifting her easily. Angela wrapped her arms around my neck, planting a wet kiss on my cheek.


I returned to my seat with Angela beside me, and Sarah took the seat on my other side, effectively blocking Elle from her intended position.


"Well, isn't this cozy?" Sarah remarked, her voice deceptively light. "It's been ages since we've had a full family dinner."

Her eyes found Elle, still standing. "Elle, why are you still standing? Please,sit down.We're all waiting to begin."

Elle had no choice but to sit beside Mother. "Sarah," she greeted Sarah stiffly. "It's been too long."

"Certainly has," Sarah replied. "I honestly thought you and my mother were planning to stay in Washington for good."

Sarah explained her unexpected appearance: "Just good timing. Angela heard Brandon was visiting and insisted on seeing her favorite uncle."

Angela tugged at my sleeve. "Uncle Brandon, did you miss me? It's been *forever*!"

I allowed my face to soften. "Of course I missed you. How could I not?Did you miss your uncle?"

"So much!" she exclaimed, hugging me again. "This much!" She stretched
her little arms wide.

"Since everyone has finally arrived," Grandfather announced, "let's eat before the food gets cold."




After dinner, Sarah pulled me aside while Angela played nearby.

"So this emergency phone call was about *them*?" she asked, nodding toward Mother and Elle.


"Would you have come if I had told you?" I countered.

Sarah sighed. "Fair point. It's getting late, and Angela needs to get to bed.We should head out."

"I'm leaving too," I said. "I'll walk you out."

Sarah's expression turned serious. "Brandon, you're not exactly getting any younger. When are you going to bring home a nice girl?"

I couldn't suppress the amusement that flickered in myeyes.

"Wait," she said, studying my face. "There *is* someone? For real?"

"When the time is right," I promised, "I'll introduce you."

"So there really is someone," Sarah pressed. "That's wonderful! I was worried you might still be hung up on the past, but now-"

"*Sarah*," I cut her off firmly.

She raised her hands in surrender. "Okay,okay! I'll stop."

One by one, the family dispersed. Grandfather retired first, followed by
Uncle Gavin escorting Aunt Maeve. Father exchanged a curt nod with Mother beforeretreating to his study.


I carried a sleepy Angela into the living room, Sarah following close behind.Elle immediately stood.


"Brandon, I was hoping we could talk-"

I deliberately turned away. "Mother, it's getting late. Sarah and I should be going."

Mother's face hardened. "Brandon! Have things really gotten to the point where you can't even stand to be in the same house with me?"

Angela tensed in my arms, terrified.

"It's okay, sweetheart," I murmured. "Uncle Brandon's got you."

"You're overreacting." I told Mother. "I would be leaving now regardless. I have work tomorrow."

"Work?" Mother scoffed. "This is your home, Brandon. I've come all this way, and you can't even spend one night under the same roof? I'm your mother, not your enemy."

"I've never called you my enemy," I replied evenly. "But I have early meetings, and Sarah and Angela need to get home. It's not safe for them to be on the roads too late."

Mother's eyes flashed. "Fine, go tonight. But what about tomorrow? The day after? Sarah is married, so I understand her obligations elsewhere.But you-the Stark estate is your home. What's keeping you away?"

Sarah stepped forward. "Is that what you think, Mother? That marriage
makes me less of a Stark? If that's the case, what about you? Is Stark your real home, or is it Sinclair? Am I your daughter, or is Elle?"

Mother recoiled. "How dare you speak to me that way!"

"How should I speak to you, then?" Sarah challenged.

I shifted Angela, now asleep on my shoulder. "We should go, Sarah."

Outside, I transferred Angela to Sarah's arms. "Get home safely."

"Brandon," Sarah called. "About Mother... she's been away from New York for so long. She doesn't understand us anymore. Try not to take it personally."

"I should be the one reassuring you," I replied. "Don't worry. Take care of Angela, especially with your husband out of town."

Sarah nodded. "I will." She hesitated. "And... thank you. For last time."

"No need for that between us," I said firmly. "Just remember-as long as I'm alive, you will always have a place in the Stark family."

"I know," she said softly. "Goodnight, Brandon. Go home."

"I intend to," I replied, watching them drive away.




The lights were still on when I pulled into the Hamptons estate. Through the window, I could make out June's silhouette. By the time I reached the door, she was coming down the stairs.

"Brandon? You're back!" She greeted me with a smile that washed away the evening's tension.
--
"Mm," I nodded. suddenly exhausted.

June knelt. presenting two pair of matching slippers. Mine were navy blue with a crown embroidered on them. making me "King of the House."

I froze, staring down at them.

"Brandon?" June's voice rose in concern. "What's wrong? You don't like it?
###Chapter 169:Love-making

Brandon's POV
Looking at her upturned face, those earnest eyes watching with such expectation, something warm spread through my chest.
I picked up one of the slippers.
June laughed, rubbing the back of her head self-consciously. "I was at the mall today and couldn't resist."
Standing up, she pointed at her own feet, already adorned with matching pink slippers. "See? Mine say 'Queen of the House.' We're matching! Aren't they adorable?"
I tapped the tip of her nose gently. "It's really good! I like them."
"Then put them on already!" she urged, bouncing slightly.
I slipped off my shoes and put on the slippers. "Did you go to the mall alone?"
"Of course not." She threw her arms around my neck, standing on tiptoe to kiss the corner of my mouth. "I invited Edward and Sean over for dinner today!"
My eyes narrowed immediately. "Why would you invite them? From now on, when I'm not here, don't let them in. Even if they are my friends."
June bit her finger in mock distress. "God, you're so controlling! But what about Ruby and Scarlett? I invited them over too!"
I relaxed as I realized she was teasing me. The tension from the family dinner dissipated, replaced by warmth that only June could create.
"Well said," I said, keeping my expression deliberately stern.
My hands found her waist, fingers tickling her without mercy. She squirmed in my arms, trying to escape.
"Okay, okay! I'm sorry!" she pleaded through laughter. "Stop! You know I'm super ticklish!"
She tried retaliating, poking at my sides and ribs, but I remained unmoved by her efforts.
"No fair!" she protested, pushing ineffectually against my chest. "You're not ticklish at all. You're just bullying me!"
Her weak shoves barely registered, but the sight of her—flushed and indignant—stirred something deep within me. The family tension, Mother, Elle—all faded compared to the woman before me. My wife.
I wrapped my arm around her waist, pulling her against me. June looked up, suddenly caught in my gaze. Her breath hitched, the teasing atmosphere replaced by electric tension.
I bent down and scooped her into my arms.
"Brandon!" she gasped, hands bracing against my chest. "What are you doing? Put me down!"
June's startled gasp ignited a fire in my chest, her soft weight pressing against me as I carried her to our bedroom. I laid her down on the bed with care, her trusting eyes meeting mine. The playful teasing from moments ago melted into something deeper and more urgent. My lips found hers, slow and deliberate, savoring the sweetness of her as the world around us seemed to fall away.
"I love you," I whispered against her skin, my voice thick with emotion.
The room grew quiet, filled only with the sound of our synchronized breathing. As the night deepened, every touch was a silent promise, every breath an admission of how much we belonged to one another. I lost myself in her—in the warmth of her embrace and the soft, melodic sounds of her voice calling my name. The boundaries between us blurred until there was no yesterday, no tomorrow, only this perfect, shared moment in the sanctuary of our room.
We moved together with a familiarity that spoke of a deep, unspoken bond, a rhythmic dance of passion and tenderness that left us both breathless. In the heat of our connection, I felt the weight of the world lift, replaced by an overwhelming sense of possession and love. She was mine, and in her arms, I was finally home.
When the storm of passion finally subsided into a gentle calm, I collapsed beside her, pulling her small, trembling body into my arms. Her skin was warm, her hair a beautiful mess across the pillows. She nestled against me, exhausted, her voice a faint, playful murmur.
"You said just once," she whined, eyes half-closed, a soft pout on her lips.
I chuckled, kissing her forehead and tightening my hold, feeling more content than I had in years. "I might have lied," I whispered into her hair. "But I think you've earned your rest now."
###Chapter 170: It's Time She Faced Some
Cons equences

**Sophie's POV**

The same four walls. The same ceiling. The same goddamn nightmare on repeat.

I huddled in the corner of the bedroom, knees pulled to my chest,tangled hair falling over my face. Five days since mny life imploded at Victoria's birthday party. Five days since I'd turned off my phone, disconnected from social media, and hidden in Joe Watson's suburban villa like a wounded animal.

Discarded takeout containers, crumpled tissues, and empty wine bottles littered every surface. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw their faces, felt their hands, heard their laughter.

Twice I'd found myself staring at a bottle of sleeping pills, wondering if disappearing might be easier. But then I'd think of Victoria, still living her perfect life, and rage would pull me back. If I died, she'd win. Again.

The only constant had been Anna. Sweet, scarred Anna,who checked on me three times daily like clockwork. She never stayed long but always came.

I heard the front door open, then close.

"Sophie?" Anna's voice echoed through the house."I'm here!"

I didn't answer. Couldn't find the energy to form words.

Footsteps approached, then paused at the bedroom doorway.
"Sophie, I brought you something to eat!"

I glanced up, eyes struggling to focus. Anna carried takeout bags that smelled amazing, but my stomach was too knotted to feel hunger.

"You came," I croaked.

"Of course I came," Anna replied, carefully picking her way through the debris. "I brought all your favorites. My mom made them specially-seared steak, pasta with that cream sauce you like, and dessert too."

"Just leave it there," I mumbled. "I'm not hungry right now."

Anna sighed. "Sophie, come eat something. Your body needs it. Plus, I've got something important to tell you. Good news, actually." Her eyes brightened. "Come on-eat, take a shower, and then we can go out for a bit. Just a quick walk."

My head snapped up, panic flooding my system. "Go out? Are you insane?So people can point and laugh? No fucking way!" My voice cracked."Anna, I'm tired. I just want to sleep. Please, just go."

"Hey, take it easy," Anna said, raising her hands. "I didn't mean it like that.Just around the grounds-the estate is private. And didn't you hear me?I have good news. Something that will actually make you happy."

I let out a bitter laugh. "Happy? How am I supposed to be happy now?"Tears welled up again. "Stop trying, Anna. You saw what happened.Everyone saw. They all watched as I..." My voice broke.

"My parents must be so disappointed. I can't even imagine their faces if they knew..." I buried my facé in my hands. "I don't know what to do anymore."
Anna knelt beside me, touching my shoulder. "Sophie, stop crying. It's been handled. No one knows it was you."


My head jerked up. "What?"

"Look at me," Anna said, eyes locking with mine. "No one knows it was you in that video. I swear to God."


"That's impossible!"

"Sophie, listen." Anna insisted. "It was an accident. The videos that leaked online? All blurred out-no one could tell it was you. People were just guessing. And now there's even a different story circulating, saying it was someone else. The whole thing has been taken care of."

Hope-dangerous,fragile hope-flickered inside me. "Really? But... who helped me?"

"My brother Joe arranged it."

I studied her face, noticing a slight shift in her expression. "Anna, level with me. Did Joe have to ask someone for help? Someone powerful?"

Anna hesitated, then sighed. "I wasn't going to tell you,but since you're asking... yes. It wasn't just Joe. He asked a business associate-someone with serious puIl in Manhattan. I can't tell you who, Sophie, I'm sorry. But you have to trust me."

Relief swept through me, so intense I thought I might pass out. "I know you wouldn't hurt me. Thank you, Anna. And... please thank Joe too."

Anna smiled, the scars on her face pulling slightly. "That's what friends are for. Things will get better, you'll see. Look at me-I'm still standing."
Guilt crashed over me. "Anna, about what happened to you... I never came to help when they took you away. Do you hate me for that?"

"Let's not talk about the past," Anna said quickly. "When this happened to you, I wasn't there either. Now come on, eat something!"

For the first time in days, I felt hunger. I let Anna guide me to the table and took a bite of steak. Flavors exploded on my tongue.

Anna opened her phone, scrolling through social media platforms."See?Nothing about you anywhere. And Joe made sure those rich kids swore they wouldn't share any videos or talk about what happened. You're in the clear."

I devoured two full plates as Anna continued showing me proof that my nightmare had been contained. With each bite, each reassurance, I felt strength returning.

"I'm going abroad soon," she said when I finished. "Joe found a specialist for my face. If you're still feeling down, you could come with me. Think of it as a vacation-by the time we get back, people will have forgotten everything."

I shook my head firmly. "No. I'm not going."

"What?But-"

"Things might be handled, but I'm not satisfied," I said, my voice hardening. "I can't just let this go."

Anna's expression shifted to alarm. "Sophie, what are you planning? Don't do anything stupid! You barely dodged a bullet here!"

"Relax," I said, giving her a reassuring smile that felt strange after days of
tears. "I'm not that reckless. You should go abroad, get your face fixed. I'll be fine here, waiting for you. I've got... more important things to deal with.



I paused, my smile turning cold. "Victoria is my good friend, after all.How could I possibly leave her at a time like this?"


Anna paled. "Sophie, what are you going to do? Victoria claims she dídn't know things would go this far. She's been trying to help-"

"She didn't know?" I laughed sharply. "Those paparazzi were hers, Anna!The ones who leaked the video! Stop defending her!" I stood up, energy surging through me. "Don't you remember what she was like in college?Always jealous of Summer, always plotting. And what were we? Just weapons she could use and discard. When things went wrong, we paid the price,not her."

I began pacing, my mind suddenly clear. "She's done so many terrible things, Anna. It's time she faced some consequences."
###Chapter 171: Breaking Point

**Sophie's POV**

"Anna, you don't need to pretend like I'm being unreasonable," I said, my voice sharper than intended. "She can have whatever beef she wants with Summer, but dragging us into her sick little games? That's where I draw the line."


"I understand, Sophie," Anna nodded. "I'm not blaming you. I was furious with Victoria too after Manhattan Club. I couldn't understand why she just stood there while they dragged me away." She touched her scars self-consciously. "But I've moved past it now. All I care about is getting my face fixed."

I looked up. "You're really going abroad for the surgery?"

"Yeah," she confirmed. "The visa's being processed now. I should leave in a few days."

"I'll come see you off," I offered, suddenly afraid of losing my only ally.

"I'd like that." Anna smiled, then noticed my worried expression. "Don't stress about staying at Joe's place. He's barely ever here anyway, and he's not the type to kick someone when they're down."

I met her gaze, a silent understanding passing between us. We'd both paid the price for Victoria's schemes.



A week later, Anna's visa came through. I lingered in the doorway of her bedroom,watching her pack methodically.
"Are you sure you don't want your mom to go with you?" I asked,noticing Mrs. Watson hovering anxiously behind me.

Anna shook her head firmly. "I need to do this on my own. It's not just about fixing my face-it's about proving I can handle this." She lowered her voice. "Besides, they're all tiptoeing around me like I might break.I can't stand it anymore."

"They're just worried," I said, though I understood her frustration all too well.


"I know." Anna zipped her suitcase closed with finality. "But this is something I need to face alone."

Mrs. Watson appeared beside me, eyes red-rimmed but determined. "Anna,sweetheart, are you absolutely sure you don't want us to drop you at the airport?"

"Mom, we've been over this," Anna replied gently but firmly. "I'll take a car service. It's fine."

I caught sight of Joe watching from across the ha11. his expression unreadable. When he noticed me looking, he gave a slight nod.




The morning of Anna's departure, I'd dressed carefully-baggy clothes under a bulky coat, a scarf around my neck, and a wide-brimmed hat pulled low over sunglasses. The disguise was stifling but necessary.

To my surprise, Victoria was already waiting at the terminal, similarly disguised though more stylishly. Her Chanel sunglasses and silk scarf couldn't quite hide her identity from someone who knew her as well as I did.
Anna looked startled to see us both. "I thought I told everyone not to come."


"Like we'd let you leave without saying goodbye," Victoria replied with her trademark smile.


I stepped forward first, pulling Anna into a tight hug. "I'll be here when you get back," I whispered.

She squeezed me tighter. "Sophie, about everything that's happened...sometimes it's better to let things go. But if you can't..." She pulled back slightly,voice dropping, "I won't stop you."

After Anna disappeared through security, Victoria immediately turned to me. "Sophie," she said, removing her sunglasses. "Can we talk? Please?"

I kept my face neutral. "Not here. Somewhere quiet."

"Of course," she agreed quickly. "There's a place not far from here. Very private."

Victoria led me to a tea room that screamed understated luxury-her style exactly. She'd reserved the most secluded corner, screened from the main room by elegant paper partitions.

"This place is very exclusive," Victoria explained as we settled in. "The paparazzi never come here, It's mostly just society ladies who want to gossip away from prying eyes, so you don't have to worry about... you know."

"Enough," I cut her off. "I don't want to talk about it anymore." I busied myself preparing tea,avoiding her eyes.

"I know what happened was a nightmare," I finally said,keeping my voice
steady. "And maybe it wasn't entirely your fault. But Victoria, I can't just pretend everything's fine."

Victoria leaned forward, eyes bright. "It's all Summer's fault," she hissed."That bitch was supposed to be in that room, not you. If she hadn't disappeared, none of this would have happened."

I kept my head down, jaw clenched. *Always blaming Summer. Never taking responsibility.*

"Sophie," Victoria continued, grasping my hands, "I've done everything to fix this. Alexander and I called in every favor, paid off everyone involved.The videos are gone, and no one will ever know it was you."

I studied her face, noting the perfectly rehearsed concern. Victoria had always been a talented actress.

"Thank you, Victoria," I said softly, forcing myself to grasp her hands in return. "Maybe I was too hard on you. It's just been so difficult..."

Encouraged, she squeezed my hands tighter.

"I've been having nightmares," I continued, allowing my voice to break. "I see their faces every night. Chris, the other son of a bitch... I wake up screaming. I want them to suffer for what they did to me."

I tightened my grip on her hands, my nails dligging into her skin until she flinched.

"Sorry," I mumbled, easing my grip. "I just get so angry. Chris Diaz especially. I want to destroy him. And that Windsor guy? I want him ruined."

"Sophie," Victoria warned,"you can't do anything illegal. It would only
make things worse."

I let out a bitter laugh. "So I'm just supposed to take it? My life is in ruins,and those assholes are just walking around like nothing happened."

Victoria shifted uncomfortably. "What about work? You could come to Fortune Corp,or maybe Capital-"

"No," I interrupted, seeing my opportunity. "Victoria, do you need an assistant? Someone to help with your career? I could work for you."

"For me?" Victoria looked startled. "But you're overqualified-"

"I don't care about qualifications," I insisted. "I just need to be around someone who understands what I've been through. Someone I trust."

Victoria hesitated, vanity battling with suspicion. "Are you sure?"

"I'm sure." I nodded emphatically. "Please, Victoria. I need this."

Finally, she smiled. "Alright then. You can start whenever you feel ready.But Sophie," she grew serious, "no revenge plots, okay? Just focus on healing."

"Of course," I promised, face a perfect mask of gratitude.

Victoria checked her watch. "I should get going. Alexander is expecting me at Fortune Corp."

As soon as her car pulled away, I shed my disguise like a snake shedding its skin. I pulled out my phone, dialing a number I'd memorized but never thought I'd use.

"Mr. Wilson? It's Sophie. Victoria agreed to make me her assistant."
James Wilson's calm voice came through. "Well done, Miss. That was faster than expected."

"When are we going to start?" I demanded eagerly. "Mr. Wilson, when will I get my revenge? Victoria is living her perfect life in the spotlight while I'mhiding in shadows!"


"Patience, Miss," James replied serenely. "These things take time to orchestrate properly."

"You promised me she would pay," I insisted, gripping the phone tighter.

"And she will," James assured me. "I always deliver on my promises. If you've chosen to work with me, then trust that the results will be worth the wait."

I closed my eyes, envisioning Victoria's perfect face twisted in agony. "Fine.I'll wait."

"Good," James said. "And Miss? When the time comes, I promise you won t be disappointed."
###Chapter 172: Marry Elle

Elle's POV

I smoothed down my dress as our car pulled up to Stark Tower. Aunt Jane sat beside me, immaculate as always-not a blonde hair out of place,makeup perfect, dressed in a cream designer suit that screamed money.

"Are you sure about this?" I asked, anxiety fluttering in my stomach."Brandon made it pretty clear at the estate that he doesn't want to see us."

She waved away my concern. "Nonsense, Elle. He's just being difficult.Besides, I'm his mother. He can't avoid me forever."

I wasn't convinced. The look in Brandon's eyes at the Stark estate had been chilling. But I'd been in love with him forever, and Aunt Jane had always supported me, the only real mother figure I'd ever had.

As we exited the car, I offered Aunt Jane my arm.

"Aunt Jane, you think Brandon will be angry when he finds out we've come to his office?" I asked, unable to hide my nervousness.

"What can he possibly say?" she replied confidently. "I'm his mother.Come along now!"

We marched through the grand lobby, drawing stares with every click of our heels. The elevator whisked us up to the executive floor, and Aunt Jane strode toward the large double doors at the end of the corridor.

A petite brunette-Brandon's secretary-jumped up from her desk, eyes widening in alarm.

"Excuse me! Do you have an appointment?" she called, scurrying to catch
up.

"I don't need an appointment to see my own son," Aunt Jane replied without slowing down.


"I'm sorry, but Mr. Stark is in a meeting," the woman insisted,stepping in front of us. "You can't go in there without-"

"Get out of my way," Aunt Jane said, her voice dangerously low. "Do you have any idea who I am?"


The secretary stood her ground, though visibly trembling. "I'm aware you're Mrs. Sinclair, but company policy states-"

Aunt Jane pushed past her and flung open the doors to Brandon's office.

Brandon was seated behind his desk, James Wilson standing beside him with papers. Brandon's face instantly hardened when he saw us.

"Mr. Stark!" the secretary exclaimed. "I tried to stop them,but-"

"You may go, Monica," Brandon said, unnervingly calm.

After Monica left, James gathered his papers. "We'll continue this later, sir."


"Of course," Brandon replied, and James exited, closing the door behind him.

A suffocating silence followed. Brandon remained seated, his dark eyes coolly assessing us.

"Mother," he finally said, the word sounding like poison. "What brings you to my office?"

"Just visiting her son." Aunt Jane replied, taking a seat uninvited.
I followed her example, crossing my legs elegantly just as she'd taught me.

"Not when that son is running a major corporation with confidential business." Brandon countered. "Do you have an actual reason for this visit?



"Brandon, I'm your mother. Can't you speak to me with a little respect?"

"And what kind of respect would you prefer?" he asked, voice dangerously soft. "This is Stark Group, Mother. A company. You're not an employee, so your presence here breaks protocol. Especially bringing an outsider." His gaze flicked to me briefly. "If any internal information were to leak,you'd be the first suspect."

"How dare you!" Aunt Jane snapped. "Is this how you speak to me now?"

"This is how I've always spoken to you. Grandfather and Father don't seem to have a problem with it."

"That's because they don't care about you like I do," Aunt Jane insisted,softening her tone. "They don't mind if you never come home, but I'm your mother, Brandon. I worry about you."

"You're my mother?" Brandon's eyebrow raised slightly. "Interesting that you remember that now. When I needed your concern, you weren't there.Now that I don't need it anymore, suddenly you appear."

I fidgeted,feeling the tension like electricity in the air.

"I have work to do," Brandon continued coldly. "If you have business matters, make an appointment with Monica. If it's personal, we can talk after business hours."

Aunt Jane leaned forward. "I'm here to discuss something important. Your
marriage to Elle can't be delayed any longer. You're not getting younger,and Elle graduated a year ago. We agreed you would marry her after graduation, but you've shown no intention of following through. Brandon,you promised-"

"Enough!" Brandon's voice cracked like a whip. "Let me be perfectly clear.I have never touched her, and I never will. Even if she stripped naked in front of me, I wouldn't be interested. As for marrying her-since you and my uncle are so fond of her, perhaps he should marry her instead."

I felt like I'd been slapped. Tears sprang to my eyes, my chest constricting painfully.

"How dare you!" Aunt Jane gasped. "Elle is your uncle's daughter!"

Brandon's smile was cruel. "The daughter of an old lover, not his biological child. Isn't that right?"

Aunt Jane's face turned red as Brandon picked up his phone. "Monica,send security up here now." After a pause, he made another call. "Inform all departments there will be a meeting in ten minutes."

Two security guards entered moments later.

"Mr. Stark?" one asked uncertainly.

"Please escort these ladies out," Brandon ordered without looking at us. "From now on, no one who isn't a Stark employee is allowed in without proper registration. No exceptions."

The guard shifted uncomfortably. "But sir, this lady said she's your mother... that's why we let her in."

"From now on, no one gets special treatment. See them out."
Without another glance,Brandon picked up his briefcase and walked out through a side door.


"Brandon!" Aunt Jane called after him, her voice breaking. "Is this how you treat me?"


The security guards approached apologetically. "Ma'am, we need to ask you to leave. Company policy."

"Company policy? I'm not an outsider-I'm his mother!"

"But you're not a Stark employee," the guard insisted.

Tears streamed down my face, humiliation burning through me.

"Aunt Jane," I whispered, "what am I going to do? Brandon hates me.He doesn't want to marry me. What now?"

Aunt Jane pulled me close, still rigid with anger as the guards hovered nearby. "Don't worry, Elle. I'm on your side. Brandon is just angry with me, and that's why he's rejecting you. I promised to help you, and I will.Besides, Lyanna is gone now. Even if she returns, she's no threat to you anymore. It's just a matter oftime before Brandon marries you."

*Lyanna York*. Just hearing that name made my stomach turn. The perfect.beautiful Lyanna-the woman Robert Stark had wanted for his son, the woman Brandon had actually loved.

As the guards escorted us toward the elevator, Aunt Jane's grip on my arm tightened.

"I won't let this stand," she hissed. "We'll see how Brandon feels when I speak to his father."
###Chapter 173: Coldness

**Brandon's POV**

The next morning, the underground parking garage echoed with my footsteps as James kept pace behind me.


"Mr. Stark," James began, "Sophie has already started at Stark Entertainment, working under Victoria."

I paused mid-stride, a flicker of satisfaction passing through me.

"And what does Sophie have to say for herself?" I asked.

"She seems rather impatient, sir. Quite eager to get her revenge on Victoria immediately."

I accepted the tablet he offered, quickly scanning the emails. "Did she ever question why you were helping her?"

"Not explicitly, sir. She appears too focused on her agenda to question our motives."

James hesitated, then added carefully, "There's something else. It appears Miss Lyanna has gone to Mexico."

I felt his eyes studying my face when he mentioned Lyanna. I kept my expression deliberately neutral.

"We don't know her exact purpose there," James continued. "Would you like me to have someone keep an eye on her?"

"That won't be necessary," I replied dismissively.

James nodded, then cleared his throat. "One more thing, Mr. Stark. Monica
called earlier about... Miss Elle."

I stopped abruptly at the elevator doors.

"She arrived this morning, accompanied by your father. It seems your father has arranged for her to be your new secretary."

I said nothing, but the cold fury radiating from me was answer enough.

The elevator doors opened on the twenty-seventh floor, revealing Elle Sinclair waiting by reception. Her face lit up instantly, eyes traveling appreciatively over my tailored suit. She stepped forward eagerly, reaching for my arm before my glacial stare stopped her mid-motion.

"Brandon! Good morning!" she exclaimed.

"Who sent you here?" I asked coldly. "I thought I made myself clear yesterday."

Elle's smile faltered. "You did say no non-Stark employees were allowed,but I *am* a Stark employee now. Look!" She proudly displayed an ID badge. "Uncle Robert gave this to me. Starting today. I'm your new secretary. Isn't that great? We'll get to spend so much time together!"

She hurried to keep pace as I walked toward my office, her voice grating on my nerves.

"Brandon, I understand you're busy with work. But now that I'm here, we can see each other every day. Aren't you happy about that?"

I turned sharply, my gaze cutting into her. "Are you really that stupid that you can't understand anything I told you?"

Elle's expression crumpled. "Brandon! How can you say that? I came all
the way from Washington just to be with you!"

"I'll say it one more time: Iwill not marry you. Stop wasting your time unless you want things to get unpleasant." I replied without emotion.

I slammed my office door shut with enough force to make the walls vibrate. Surveying my office with growing irritation, I noticed someone had completely rearranged it-new decorative items cluttered my desk,unfamiliar framed photos hung on the walls, and vases of flowers were scattered everywhere.

I pressed the intercom button. "Monica, come in here. Now."

Monica appeared moments later, her face pale. "Yes, Mr. Stark?"

"From now on, no one enters my office without my permission," I stated sharply. And get rid of all this trash. If I find my office altered again,there will be consequences."

As Monica hurried out with the bin full of decorations, Elle burst through the door, her composure shattered.

"Brandon, how could you?" she cried. "Those things weren't trash! They were gifts from me! I sacrificed my beauty sleep to make your office nicer.How could you just throw everything away?"

My patience snapped. "Say one more unnecessary word and you'll join those items in the trash."

I fixed her with a stare that had made Wall Street veterans crumble. "Let me be clear. I don't know what delusion you've fed my parents, but it stops now. If you overstep again, I won't care what anyone has to say about it. Now get out."
"Brandon!" Elle pleaded.

"OUT!" I roared.

With a dramatic sob, Elle fled the office.

I immnediately reached for my phone, only to hear a knock as Robert Stark entered,his expression resigned.


"Brandon," he began with a sigh, "I know this situation is uncomfortable,but you need to accept it. Your mother rarely asks me for anything, and when she does, it's for Elle. I'm asking you-please, just let your mother try."


I leaned back in my chair. "Father, whatever happened between you and Mother is your business. I'm not a child anymore. You can't dictate my decisions."


"I know," he replied simply.

I gave a short laugh, twirling a pen between my fingers. "Whatever's going on between you two, resolve it yourselves. Don't force me to step in."

Robert's face tensed, then relaxed into an awkward smile. "I've failed as a father, haven't I? Sarah blames me, you blame me, Ellie blames me..." He exhaled heavily. "Brandon, I've let you all down."

"I don't care about that," I replied, the pen suddenly still in my hand."The person you've wronged is Ellie and her mother. When I opposed Ellie returning to the Stark family, it wasn't because I disliked her. It was because she's a good person who shouldn't pay for the mistakes of the previous generation. She's too innocent for the Stark family."

Robert froze, genuine shock spreading across his face.
"Brandon, do you... mean that?" he asked, disbelief evident.

"I have no reason to lie. Ellie doesn't belong in this family-that's why I opposed her return."


I paused. "Elle can stay at Stark Group, but how I handle the situation is not up for discussion."


"Fair enough," Robert agreed, visibly relieved. "I only promised your mother that Elle could join Stark Group, not what position she'd hold."

He hesitated, then added, "Brandon, are you still thinking about Lyanna?"


"You're overthinking things, Father," I cut him off. "What happened between Lyanna and me wasn't what you assumed. Focus on your own relationship with Mother."

Robert sighed. "Fine. Handle it however you see fit." He paused. "By the way,Joe Watson mentioned you resolved a recent scandal. What's your connection to this Sophie girl?"

"Sophie?" I frowned slightly. "There is none."

"Brandon, don't try to fool me. I'm not opposed to you dating,but a girl like that..."

"Do you really think my standards are that low?" I asked, my tone casual but eyes sharp.

Robert blinked, then laughed, relief flashing in his eyes. "I suppose I was worried for nothing."

After he left, I called Monica back. "Send Elle to the secretarial pool," I instructed. "Assign her some basic task-nothing that involves confidential
information, and keep her far away from me."

It was the most accommodation I was willing to offer. "Just do your jobs as usual and ignore her presence."


"Yes, Mr. Stark," Monica replied, clearly relieved to have direction on handling Elle.
###Chapter 174: Am I Jealous?

**Elle's POV**

The coffee shop in the Stark Tower lobby was my temporary refuge after Brandon's brutal dismissal upstairs. I needed to rebuild my confidence.The baristas scurried around as I specified exactly how I wanted my latte.

"More foam, please. And make sure it's not too hot this time," I instructed,drumming my nails against the counter. "Oh, and I'll need some of those pastries with raspberry filling. Mr. Stark hasn't had breakfast yet."


This was how things should be-people responding without question.Working at Stark Group was my chance to prove to Brandon we belonged together. Aunt Jane promised this would work.

I was reviewing the pastry selection when Monica-Brandon's stuck-up secretary-appeared with her irritatingly perfect posture.

"Miss Sinclair," she said crisply, "your position has been arranged. Mr.Stark personally oversaw the assignment."

My spirits instantly lifted. Brandon hadn't kicked me out! I knew he must care deep down.

"I know," I replied dismissively, masking my relief.

Monica's eyes narrowed slightly. "Miss Sinclair, it's currently work hours."

I waved her off. "What's the rush? Can't you see I'm waiting for pastries?Brandon probably hasn't eaten breakfast yet."

"Miss Sinclair!" Monica's expression couldn't hide her disdain. "It is work hours, and you haven't even started your position. Furthermore,you're a
Stark Group employee now-you don't have authority to direct cafeteria staff."


Heat rose to my cheeks as I straightened in my chair.

"Who the hell do you think you are?" I snapped. "How dare you speak to me that way?"


"However, as of today, you are my subordinate. Are you sure you want to speak to me like that?"


"You... you..." I sputtered, gripping my coffee cup tightly. "You're nothing!I came to Stark Group for Brandon, and nobody except Brandon gets to tell me what to do. You're just a secretary!"


Monica gestured to her ID badge. "Miss Sincláir, you clearly doesn't understand your position. Now that you've joined Stark Group,you're nothing but an employee. As a secretary assigned to the 14th floor, you report to me, the Executive Secretary." She tapped her title. "Feel free to test me,and we'll see whether Mr. Stark chooses to fire me or you."

With that,Monica turned and walked toward the elevators. Fury built inside me, but a small voice reminded me that Monica had legitimate daily access to Brandon.

Swallowing my pride, I hurried after her. "Don't think I'm scared of you."I called. "Everything I'm doingis for Brandon. You wouldn't understand."

Monica merely gave a derisive snort.

Monica led me to a small desk tucked in a corner of the 14th floor-practically a closet compared to what I'd expected.

"Miss Sinclair, this will be your workspace," she announced. "These
materials are files left by the previous secretary. Mr. Stark felt that since you have no relevant experience, you might struggle with confidential documents. For the next month, you'll be familiarizing yourself with these basic materials."


She flipped open the top folder from a stack of paperwork. "I understand you graduated from Georgetown? That's a fine institution. This should be child's play for someone with your education. I have actual work to do."


"Monica," I said through gritted teeth, "I'm not doing this."

"These are Mr. Stark's direct orders," she replied coolly. "At Stark Group,Mr. Stark's word is final. If you don't like it, you're welcome to leave Stark Group never lacks for talented applicants."

I could feel my face turning purple with rage as Monica walked away.

By noon, I couldn't takeit anymore. I called Aunt Jane, desperate for her intervention.

"Elle, darling," Aunt Jane's voice was firm. "I've created the opportunity.The rest is up to you. If you want to build a relationship with Brandon.you need to work properly. As for this Monica person, her position indicates Brandon values her. Rather than antagonizing her, try to win her over. Do you understand?"

"I get it, Aunt Jane," I replied, biting my lip to hold back tears. "Ill try to get along, but Brandon doesn't even want to see me."

"Then find a way to see him anyway," she said impatiently. "You're not a child anymore. I can't do everything for you."

**Summer's POV**
The cafeteria at Stark Group buzzed with conversation as I sat with my lunch. Leo Schmidt took the seat across from me. Since joining Stark Group, I'd learned so much-not just about work, but about how much I didn't know before.


Even Heather, who'd initially seemed determined to make my life difficult.had warmed considerably. The three of us had just returned from a site inspection, catching the tail end of lunch. All around, people discussed something that had happened on the 14th floor.


I focused on my food, not interested in office gossip, when Heather suddenly jumped up and scurried to a nearby table. Leo watched her go,then turned to me.

"Aren't you curious?" he asked. "I thought you had connections upstairs."

I had a mouthful of salad, so I chewed before answering. "What kind of response does Director Schmidt want from me?"

Leo recognized my deflection and laughed. "I guess I'm being nosy."

"You are," I agreed with a smile. "Seems unlike a department head to be interested in gossip."

Heather rushed back, practically vibrating with excitement. "You guys won't believe what I just heard!"


I played along. "What did you hear?"

"That new hire on the 14th floor? Apparently, she's some distant relative of Mr. Stark's mother-no blood relation though. And get this-she didn't come here to work. She came to chase a man!"

I paused mid-bite. "Chase a man?"
I didn't know much about Brandon's family, just that he had sisters who weren't in New York, and a married sister.


"Yes!" Heather nodded vigorously. "And not just any man-our CEO himself! Isn't that weird? Even without blood relation, she's still technically his sister in name, right?"

"She's pursuing Brandon Stark?" I asked, my brow furrowing slightly.


"Shhh! Keep your voice down!" Heather frantically covered my mouth."And you can't just casually call the CEO by his first name! I'm just repeating what I heard."


"From whom?" Leo interjected. "That's not the kind of rumor you should spread without a reliable source."


"The cafeteria staff!" Heather explained. "Apparently, this Sinclair woman came in demanding special coffee and pastries, acting like she owned the place. The baristas rushed to accommodate her, but then Monica came down and told her to get upstairs. They overheard them arguing, and Monica won. Everyone's saying this Elle Sinclair is completely delusional-our CEO has zero interest in her."


I felt my expression soften, the tension in mny shoulders easing. "Mr. Stark doesn't seem like that type of person," I commented. "He's not one to mix business with personal matters."

*Of course Brandon has no interest in Elle Sinclair*, I thought. *Because I'm the CEO's wife!*

The realization of my possessive thoughts caught me by surprise.

*Wait a minute*, I wondered, *am I actually jealous?*
###Chapter 175: You Sure You Aren't Jealous?

**Summer's POV**

I caught Leo studying my reaction, his gaze sharp and assessing. I shot him a pleading look, and he immediately cleared his throat, rapping his knuckles sharply on the table.

"Ms. Bell," he said sternly, "discussing the CEO's personal matters during work hours is highly inappropriate. This kind of idle gossip has no place at Stark Group."

Heather's face immediately flushed. "I-I didn't mean-"

"It's nearly time to return to work," Leo continued,checking his watch."Let's finish up here. The Manhattan West Side project won't complete itself.



As Heather gathered her things, thoroughly chastised, I mouthed a quick "thank you" to Leo. I couldn't help wondering-who exactly was Elle Sinclair? And why would Brandon's mother push this strange arrangement? The thought of some beautiful woman pursuing Brandon made my chest tighten uncomfortably.

*Am I actually jealous?* The realization hit me with surprising force. *I've never been the jealous type before...*

By late afternoon, my phone vibrated with a text from Brandon.

*Dinner tonight at 8. I'll drive. Meet me in the parking garage.*

As I set my phone down, Heather approached my desk.

"Summer," she began hesitantly, "do you have any plans tonight?"
"Hmm?" I looked up. "What's up?"

"Nothing important," she assured me. "It's just, you've been at Stark Group for a while now, but we've never really hung out outside of work. I was wondering if you'd like to grab dinner together?"

"Tonight?" I asked, already calculating how to decline politely.

"Yeah," she nodded eagerly. "Are you free?"

"I'm really sorry, but I can't tonight," I said, genuinely regretful. "I already have plans with family. Could we do it another time?"

Disappointment flashed across her face. "Oh... that's okay."

"Is everything alright?" I asked, noticing her crestfallen expression.

Heather sighed. "It's just... you know I'm not getting any younger,right?My parents have been pushing me about marriage non-stop. My mom set me up on this blind date tonight, and I really didn't want to go alone. It feels so awkward!"

"Oh, Heather," I sympathized. "Parents always think they know best. But maybe give it a chance? If you don't like him, you can always make an excuse and leave early."

"I guess," she conceded glumly."It's just nerve-wracking going alone."

"I'm really sorry I can't joinyou," I said. "If you'd asked earlier, I might have been able to rearrange things."

"No, it's fine," Heather straightened up. "You go ahead. I should start getting ready anyway."

"Good luck tonight," I called after her. "Let me know how it goes!"
At exactly 6:30. I headed for the parking garage. As I approached the executive section, I heard voices that made me freeze mid-step.

"Brandon, I didn't drive here today. Could you give me a ride home?"

The voice was high-pitched and sweet-sickeningly so-with a deliberate breathy quality that immediately set my teeth on edge. I quickly ducked behind a concrete pillar, peering around to see a stunningly beautiful blonde woman standing beside Brandon's car.


When Brandon didn't immediately respond, she continued, "Brandon?Why aren't you saying anything? I came with Jane this morning, and now I don't have a car. I'm not very familiar with New York yet. Please, just drive me home?"

"Call Jane yourself," Brandon replied, his voice flat and cold. "Have her send a car for you."

"Brandon!" Elle gasped, sounding shocked. "How can you be so cruel? I'm your sister! I'm a guest of the Stark family. Jane specifically asked you to take care of me. You can't treat me like this!"

"Elle," Brandon's voice carried a dangerous edge, "I'll warn you one last time. I don't care if you work at Stark Group, but if you're expecting anything from me personally, you'll be disappointed. Stay away from me.or you'll find I can be much less accommodating than I've been so far."

My phone suddenly pinged with a text, the sound echoing in the garage.


*Where are you?* Brandon had written.

"Who's there?" Elle calledI out sharply. "Show yourself!"

Before I could decide what to do, Brandon lowered his car window.
"Elle!" he called.

"Yes, Brandon?" she answered immediately, her voice instantly returning to its sugary sweetness.


"I just remembered I left an important document in my office," he said smoothly. "Could you go up and get it for me?"

Elle's face lit up. "Of course! I'd be happy to help. Don't go anywhere!"

"I'll be right here," Brandon assured her.


The moment Elle disappeared into the elevator, I darted out and slid into the passenger seat.

"Drive," I whispered urgently. "Before she comes back!"

Brandon's lips curved into an amused smile as he started the engine."Scared?"

"I am not!" I protested, quickly buckling my seatbelt. "I just don't feel like dealing with...that."

"You're the one who should be explaining things," I said,crossing my arms. "Who exactly is Elle Sinclair, and why is she acting like you're her property?"

"I thought with our relationship, you'd understand the situation,"Brandon replied cryptically.

"Understand what? I don't understand anything!" I exclaimed. "All I know is that during lunch, everyone was talking about how Stark Group's CEO has this beautiful, capable new secretary who's apparently head over heels for him."
Brandon's eyes lit up with undisguised amusement. "Summer, are you jealous?"


"What? Jealous? Me?" I sputteredindignantly. "I've never been jealous a day in my life!"


"Is that so?" he askedclearly not believing me.


I glared at him, but he merely continued driving, that infuriating half-smile still playing on his lips.

"She's Elle Sinclair," he finally explained. "My maternal uncle's adopted daughter. And she is close to my mother."


"Adopted?" I echoed, surprised. "Not biological daughter? Your uncle doesn't have his children?"


"He does," Brandon confirmed.

"Then why..." I trailed off, trying to understand.

"She's the daughter of my uncle's first love," Brandon clarified. "No blood relation to the Sinclairs or Starks."


"Wait, seriously?" I couldn't keep the shock from my voice. "She has no blood relationship to your uncle at all? He must really care about his frst love! But doesn't his family object to this arrangement?"

"It's complicated," Brandon said, his expression darkening slightly."The Sinclair family does object, but they know their objections won't change anything. Elle has been with my mother and uncle since she was little.They dote on her."

"So Elle is at Stark Group because your mother arranged it?" I pieced
together. "With the goal of getting her close to you,making you fall for her,and eventually marrying her? But even if you're not blood relatives,you're still... what? Step-cousins? That's not something you can just ignore.Does this uncle of yours really approve of this?"


Brandon glanced at me, his expression softening. "Summer, sometimes you don't need to be quite so clever."

I gave him a weak smile. "I don't mean anything by it. I'm just worried your mother might dislike me because of Elle."

Brandon could clearly see what was going through my mind. He shook his head,squeezing my hand. "You don't need to worry about any of that.I married you, and I'll take responsibility for that decision. These things aren't your concern. I'm the one who married you, I'm the one who'll spend my life with you-not them."

I nodded, "Bt how long is Elle going to stay? If she refuses to leave,that could be really awkward."

"You sure you aren't jealous right now?"

"Of course not!" I denied, "I'm just concerned. You saw how she was acting toward you..."

"Don't worry," Brandon reassured me, patting the back of my hand. "I won't let her stay too long."
###Chapter 176: Taste of Home

**Brandon's POV**

The Hamptons estate welcomed me with its familiar silence as I stepped through the door. Without pausing, I made my way directly to my study.

I settled into my chair, powering up my laptop and phone. Immediately,notifications flooded both screens. Twenty-seven missed calls on my phone.
Most were from Elle Sinclair and Jane Sinclair. Two were from my father.

I ignored them all, dialing James instead.


"What happened after I left with Mrs. Stark today?" I asked without preamble.

"Ah," James's voice took on a carefully neutral tone. "Miss Sinclair went to your office after you left. When she couldn't find you, she became..agitated. She triggered the security system trying to access your private files."


"And?" I prompted, a muscle tightening in my jaw.

"Security responded to the alarm. She couldn't explain her presence.When they tried to contact you and found your phone was off, they threatened to involve the police. Miss Sinclair contacted your mother, who demanded the security guards be fired immediately."

"The guards-what are their names?"

"John and Miller, sir," James replied.

"Give them each a bonus-one month's salary. And promote them."
There was a brief pause. "Sir?"

"They did their job correctly. They deserve to be rewarded, not punished."

"Of course, Mr. Stark," James said, his voice brightening. "Ill arrange it immediately."


"And James," I added, "upgrade the security system. Make it more comprehensive."


"Yes,Mr. Stark. I'll contact the security company first thing tomorrow.I'll ensure not even a fly couId get in without proper clearance."

Before hanging up, James hesitated. "Mr. Stark, if I may..."

"What is it?" I asked.

"I've noticed a change in your schedule recently," he began carefully. "You've been leaving the office at reasonable hours and arriving at consistent times. It's... unusual."

"Is that a problem?" My tone was neutral, though I knew exactly what he was getting at.

"Not at all, sir," James replied, a hint of warmth in his typically formal voice. "On the contrary, it's refreshing. You used to practically live at the office."

"Mrs. Stark prefers we commute together when possible," I explained. "It's a practical arrangement."

"Of course, sir," James said, though I could hear the smile in his voice."Very practical."

"Anything else?" I asked pointedly.
"No,sir. Except-" he paused, "it's good to see you living like this, Mr.Stark. Like a normal person."

As I set down my phone, a movement at the doorway caught my attention.June stood there, leaning against the frame, wearing a ridiculous cartoon apron with a smiling panda face across the front.

"How long have you been standing there?" I asked.

"Not long," she replied, smiling. "All done with work? Dinner's ready!"

"Come here," I said, motioning her forward.

She crossed the room. As she reached my desk, her eyes widened.

"Wow, Leo got these to you already?" she asked, looking at the papers scattered across my desk.

I tapped a section of calculations. "Are these your numbers?"

"Yeah," she nodded,leaning closer. "Is something wrong?"

"No," I said, studying the detailed work. "You did well. Very well, actually.
"I pointed to a specific section. "But here-if you reduced this further and approached it from a different angle, it might yield better results."

I explained the alternative method, drawing out the calculations.June leaned over my shoulder, her scent distracting me momentarily.

"Do you understand?" I asked, finishing the explanation.

She blinked rapidly, as if coming out of a daze. "Huh? Oh... are you hungry?"

I couldn't help the smile that tugged at my mouth. She hadn't heard a
word I'd said.

"Let's eat," I conceded. "We can discuss this later."

"Great!" she brightened immediately.

June gathered the papers as we left the study. I watched her efficient movements, appreciating how naturally she'd integrated herself into my space.

"I madde steak," she chatted as we headed downstairs. "And pork ribs. Oh,and these amazing eggplants! It might be a bit heavily seasoned-I hope you don't mind."

"I'll eat anything you make," I replied simply.

She glanced back at me, a smile playing at her lips. "Has anyone ever told you how sweet you can be?"

"Is it working on you?" I asked, enjoying the blush that immediately rose to her cheeks.

"Yes," she admitted with a pretend scowl. "And it's too much."

"Can't help it," I said, reaching for her hand as we reached the bottom of the stairs.

I'd never imagined I could enjoy something as simple as listening to someone talk about their day. BuIt June's voice, her animated expressions-it all captivated me completely.

This, I realized, was what people meant when they talked about coming home. Not to a place, but to a person.

At the foot of the stairs, I pulled her toward me, my hand slipping around
her waist as I leaned down to kiss her.

Just as our lips were about to meet, my phone rang shrilly in my pocket.June jumped back, startled.

"I'll go set the table," she said quickly, escaping to the kitchen.


I pulled out my phone, Jane Sinclair's name flashing on the screen. With a resigned sigh. I answered.

"Hello?"

"Brandon, it's Mom." Her voice-refined, cultured, and utterly unwelcome-came through clearly.

"Mother," I managed. "It's late. What do you want?"


June reappeared silently at the bottom of the stairs, catching my eye.Seeing my annoyance, she reached for my free hand and traced letters on my palm:*S-M-I-L-E*.

Despite myself, the tension in my shoulders eased slightly.

"Mother, if there's nothing urgent, I'll have to go," I said, my tone marginally less icy.

"Brandon," she sighed dramatically. "I know you've been angry with me for years, but you don't understand what happened between your father and me. We... we can never go back to how things were."

"I'm well aware," I replied flatly. "If that's all you called to discuss, it's unnecessary. I'm no longer the child you remember. And frankly, I couldn't care less about the state of your relationship with Father."

June's eyes widened at my harsh tone, but she didn't pull away. Instead,
she squeezed my hand gently.

"Fine," Jane conceded. "Let's not discuss your father and me. Let's talk about you and Elle. She cares for you deeply, Brandon. You know that.I know you're still thinking about Lyanna York, but she betrayed you years ago. People can't live in the past forever. Elle is an exceptional young woman who has waited for you all these years. Can you really bear to disappoint her?"


"Are you suggesting I have no choice but to marry her?" I asked, my voice dropping dangerously. "And if I refuse?"
###Chapter 177: No More

Summer's POV
"Brandon!" The voice on the phone was so loud I could hear it clearly even though I wasn't on the call. The shrill, demanding tone made me wince.
Brandon's expression hardened as he listened to whatever his mother was saying. The muscles in his jaw tightened, his eyes darkening dangerously.
"Mother, I don't have time for this discussion," he cut her off abruptly. "It’s late, and I need to eat dinner. Goodnight." He ended the call with a decisive tap, slipping the phone into his pocket.
I realized I was still gripping his hand and probably had been since his mother called. When he noticed, his expression softened immediately, one eyebrow lifting in question.
"What's wrong?" he asked, his voice gentle.
I shook my head, hesitating for a moment before asking. "Do you and your mother... not get along well?"
The coldness in his voice when he spoke to Jane Sinclair had been impossible to miss. There was history there—a lot of it, and none of it good from what I could tell.
"Is there some kind of misunderstanding between you two?" I pressed when he didn't immediately answer.
"No," Brandon replied, his tone suddenly light as he reached out to ruffle my hair. The abrupt shift was jarring. "Don't overthink it. Weren't you saying dinner's ready? Let's go."
I recognized a deflection when I heard one. Whatever was going on between Brandon and his mother, he clearly didn't want to discuss it. I decided to play along. "Sure, I'll dish up for you!" I said with forced brightness, heading toward the kitchen.
As I arranged our plates at the dining table, I couldn't stop thinking about Brandon's relationship with his mother. The Stark family dynamics were clearly complicated, with Jane Sinclair pushing Elle toward Brandon despite his obvious disinterest. It reminded me a bit too much of my own family situation. Between Brandon's fractured relationship with his mother and my toxic connection to the Taylors, we were quite the pair.

I should have known that Brandon's mood would follow us into the bedroom. Something about his mother always seemed to trigger a deep, restless energy within him, and tonight was no exception.
The moment the door closed, the atmosphere shifted. Brandon’s silence was heavy, charged with an intensity that seemed to vibrate in the air. He didn't speak, but the way he looked at me—with a dark, unreadable fire in his eyes—told me everything. His touch was more demanding than usual, his movements fueled by a raw, unfiltered need that he couldn't seem to suppress.
He pulled me into a fierce embrace, his kiss deep and possessive, as if he were trying to drown out the echoes of his mother’s voice with the reality of my presence. There was a desperate edge to his passion tonight, a silent declaration that in this room, in this moment, I was the only thing that mattered to him.
"Brandon—" I murmured against his lips, but he silenced me with another kiss, his hands firm as they guided me back against the pillows.
The night became a whirlwind of intense connection. It wasn't the gentle, slow romance we often shared; instead, it was a profound release of the tension he had been carrying. He moved with a relentless focus, his presence overwhelming and all-consuming. Every touch was an assertion of his claim over me, a silent promise that he would never let the outside world—or his family—interfere with what we had.
I found myself swept up in the tide of his emotions, my own heart racing to match his pace. It was a beautiful, chaotic collision of two souls. In the shadows of the room, he let his guard down in the only way he knew how, revealing the depth of the hunger and the fierce loyalty he felt for me.
As the storm finally subsided, Brandon pulled me close, his breathing ragged against my ear. He held me with a desperate kind of strength, his hand resting heavily on my waist.
"You're mine, June," he whispered, his voice rough and low, the words vibrating through me. "Only mine."
I leaned into him, exhausted but grounded by the sheer weight of his devotion. The tension of the evening had finally broken, leaving us both spent in the quiet aftermath. As I drifted toward sleep, I realized that while Brandon’s past might be filled with shadows, the fire he felt for me was the only light he truly cared about.
###Chapter 178: Not Going To Work Together

**Summer's POV**

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains as I groaned, every muscle in my body protesting as I tried to move. My lower back ached,and my legs felt like jelly. I blinked blearily at the clock-7:45 AM. I was definitely going to be late.

"Hey?" Brandon's voice came from the doorway, amusement evident in his tone. He was already dressed in a perfectly tailored suit,looking frustratingly refreshed and energetic. "You're going to be late."

"You're sleeping in the guest room tonight," I announced, not bothering to hide my annoyance. "I'm serious this time."

Brandon's eyes narrowed slightly before his lips curved into that infuriating smile. He crossed the room in a few strides, one hand bracing against the headboard as he leaned down to press a gentle kiss to my forehead.

"Come on, get up. Breakfast is ready," he said, his voice warm and coaxing.

I pushed him away, raising my hands in mock threat. "Did you not hear what I said? Tonight, you're in the guest room. I'm not kidding around!"

I sucked in a sharp breath as pain shot through my lower back when I tried to sit up. "Brandon, just... stay away from me right now."

He squinted slightly, reaching out to ruffle my hair. "Are you seriously angry? Look, I'm sorry. I'll try to show more restraint next time, I promise.I won't let my wife get so tired."

"Is that really the issue?" I scoffed, utterly unconvinced. "You say that




--
every time, but you never follow through. I'm not falling for it again!" I threw back the covers and climbed out of bed, wincing as I did so.I physically pushed him toward the door, my hands flat against his chest."Out. Now."


I managed to get him into the hallway and quickly shut the door, turning the lock with a satisfying click. "Don't think I'll forgive you so easily this time," I called through the door.


When I finally made my way downstairs, a delicious aroma hit me immediately. I paused at the foot of the stairs, sniffing appreciatively.

"Is that... congee?" I asked in disbelief, peering into the dining room.

Brandon waved me over from his seat at the table. "Come and eat."

I practically skipped over, my earlier irritation forgotten at the sight of a perfect bowl of corn congee steaming on the table. "How did you know I was craving corn congee?" I asked, delighted.

"Hurry up and eat," he urged, checking his watch. "We're running late."

After a few blissful moments of silence, I suddenly remembered something important. "Oh! I can't·go to work with you today," I announced,looking up from my bowl.

Brandon's eyes met mine, his spoon pausing midway to his mouth."Why not?"

"Did you forget what happened yesterday?" I reminded him. "Your cousin Elle works at Stark Group now. We almost got caught yesterday in the parking garage."

I continued explaining, not immediately noticing how Brandon's

"I was thinking I could take a cab or-"' I looked up and stopped mid-sentence. Brandon's eyes had turned cold, his jawline rigid. "What's wrong?" I asked uncertainly, swallowing hard.

"Are you afraid of her finding out?" he asked, his voice eerily calm. "Is our relationship something you're ashamed of? June, are you really that reluctant to let people know about us?"

I couldn't help it-I burst out laughing, nearly choking on my congee."Pfft!"

"You're angry because I don't want Elle to know we're together?" I asked incredulously after I'd recovered. "Brandon, I had no idea you had such a short fuse!"

Brandon's eyebrow arched dangerously, his narrow eyes flashing with something that might have intimidated me if I hadn't known him so well.

"We've discussed this a million times, haven't we?" I explained patiently. "It's not that I don't want people to know. I just think we need to take it slow. At first, I didn't want to publicly announce our marriage because I was worried the Taylors would try to use our relationship to get favors from you."

I set down my spoon, resting my chin in my hand. "But now, it's different.You're a Stark, and you know how your family might react. Your mother seems dead set on Elle being with you. If they found out about me now.wouldn't that create a huge mess? Not just for me, but for you too."

"Are you bothered by Elle's presence?" he asked directly, lifting his gaze to meet mine.
I blinked in surprise at his bluntness, then smiled thoughtfully.Was I bothered? Of course I was. I was Brandon's lawfully wedded wife, legally and in every way that mattered. Yet hardly anyone knew,while Brandon's mother was actively trying to set him up with someone else. No woman would be cool with that situation.


"Brandon," I finally said, "if I admitted I'm bothered by Elle, would you think I'm being unreasonable?"


I bit my lip nervously, watching his reaction carefully.


To my surprise, Brandon actually laughed-a genuine laugh that transformed his face entirely.


"Brandon?" I asked; confused by his reaction.

The ice in his expression melted completely, his usual calm returning. "Not at all. In fact, I'm glad you're bothered by her."

His mouth curled into a slight smile. "If she bothers you, I'llhave her removed immediately."

"No, that's not necessary," I protested quickly. "I'm just thinking out loud."


In reality, I knew it wasn't that simple. Elle was Jane Sinclair's adopted daughter. If Brandon forced her out,his already strained relationship with his mother would certainly deteriorate further.

"You don't need to consider my feelings," Brandon insisted, his voice firm.
"If her presence bothers you, I'll find a way to make her leave."

He stood and came around the table, placing his hands on my shoulders."
No one is more important than you. Remember that."
I tilted my head back to look up at him, reaching up to trace his jawline with my finger. "You're getting better and better at this! You know that?"

I shook my head. "Don't worry about it. I appreciate the thought, but I know you don't have feelings for her, and I'm confident about that."
###Chapter 179: Are They Following Us?

**Brandon's POV**

"Are you sure you don't want us to go together?" I asked June as she gathered her things before we left for Stark Group.


June finally looked up, her expression a mix of exasperation and amusement. "No. Not yet." She approached me, reaching up to straighten my tie even though it was already perfect. "Besides, I thought you wanted to sleep in the master bedroom tonight?"

My jaw tightened at the reminder of our arrangement. "Are you still going through with that ridiculous threat?"

"It's not ridiculous," she insisted, her fingers lingering on my chest. "I wvas serious. But..." Her eyes met mine, a mischievous glint appearing. "If you behave today and let me go to work separately, I might reconsider."

"Blackmail, Mrs. Stark?" I raised an eyebrow, catching her wrist gently. "I didn't know you had it in you."

She grinned, pulling away. "I'm learning from the best. Now I need to go if I want to beat you there."

I watched her leave, already planning my day around seeing her again.

By mid-morning, my patience was wearing thin. James entered my office with a hesitant expression I'd come to recognize as the prelude to unwelcome news.

"Mr. Stark," he began carefully; "I believe there's been another... incident.Elle and Monica had a rather heated exchange in the secretarial pool.Your mmother arrived shortly after and has taken Elle out of the building."
I didn't look up from the document I was reviewing. "When did they leave?"


"About twenty minutes ago, sir."

"And where are they now?"


"Your mother mentioned something about lunch," James replied,his professional demeanor never wavering despite the absurdity of the situation. "Though it's only eleven-thirty."

I reached for my phone, tapping the intercom. "Monica, when Elle returns,mark her absence as unauthorized. First warning."

"Yes, Mr. Stark," came Monica's efficient reply.

As if on cue, my phone rang. I glanced at the caller ID and felt a familiar tension settle in may shoulders. "Mother."

James took that as his cue to leave, closing the door silently behind him.

"Brandon!" My mother's voice carried through the speaker, that familiar cultured tone that had once soothed me as a child now setting my teeth on edge. "Elle and I are having lunch. You work your employees far too hard,you know. The poor girl has lost weight since starting at Stark Group! Is this how you treat all your staff, or just the ones you're supposed to care about?"

I leaned back in my chair, my voice deliberately cool. "If I'm not mistaken,Mother, it's barely eleven-thirty. Last time I checked, Stark Group's lunch hour begins at noon. Since Elle has decided to become an employee, she's subject to the same rules as everyone else. If she finds that arrangement unsatisfactory, she's welcome to resign."
"Brandon!" she gasped. "How dare you speak to me like-"

I ended the call, setting my phone down with more force than necessary.
Without hesitation. I stood and grabbed my coat from the rack.

James appeared at my door as if summoned. "Sir?"

"I'm heading out for the afternoon," I informed him, shrugging into my coat. "When Elle returns, make sure Monica processes that warning. I don't care who calls or what excuse they offer."

"Understood, sir," James nodded. "Your three o'clock-"

"Reschedule it," I cut him off, already moving toward the door.

June's voice floated through my phone as I waited in the parking garage."
Is this a bad time?" she asked, sounding hesitant. "You sound... tense."

"What is it?" I asked, softening my tone slightly.

"Are you in your office? Leo's still out sick, but we've finished the second review of those Manhattan West Side survey data you had questions about.I was hoping to drop them off."

The timing couldn't have been more perfect. "I'm in the garage," I told her."Come down."

"You're leaving?" Her voice carried a note of disappointment. "If you're on your way out, I can just give you the files tonight. It's not urgent."

"It is," I insisted. "Come down. Ten minutes. I'Il take you with me."

A pause."With you? Where?"

"You'll see." I ended the call before she could protest further.
I was leaning against my car, finishing another call when I spotted her.June hurried across the garage, clutching a folder to her chest,her cheeks flushed from rushing. Her hair had come slightly loose from its professional updo, and she was breathing hard by the time she reached me.

"Nine minutes and fifty seconds," I noted, ending my call. "Impressive."

"Here," she thrust the folder at me, still catching her breath. "I should probably get back upstairs now. Where are you headed anyway?"

I took the folder, but my other hand caught her arm gently. "Get in."

June glanced at the passenger door, then back at me. "Are you sure? Íf you're going to a meeting or something important, I don't want to be in the way."

"If I thought you'd be in the way," I replied, opening the door for her, "I wouldn't have asked you to come."

She hesitated another moment before sliding into the seat. I closed the door behind her and moved to the driver's side, catching her watching me as I got in.

"What?" I asked, amused.

She quickly looked away. "Nothing."

I leaned over, reaching across her to secure her seatbelt. She froze, her body going rigid as I pulled the belt across her chest. "Relax," I murmured,clicking it into place. "I don't bite. At least, not in public."

Her cheeks flushed deeper. "Very funny. So where are we going that's so important I had to rush down here?"
"Patience," I advised, turning the key in the ignition. The engine purred to life. "You'll find out soon enough."


As I pulled out of the parking space, I took a moment to properly look at her. June was dressed in her usual workwear-simple blouse,blazer,and practical trousers. All perfectly appropriate for the office, but not for where we were headed.

"What?" she asked, noticing my scrutiny. "Is something wrong?"

"Not wrong," I replied carefully. "But we need to make a stop first."

She glanced down at herself, understanding immediately. "My clothes aren t suitable, are they?"

"Smart as always, Mrs. Stark."

"I'm not smart," she countered with a small smile. "You're just obvious. So,are we heading home to change?"

I checked my watch. "No time. We'll stop by the mall near Stark Tower."

June launched into a detailed explanation of the survey results, pointing out discrepancies they'd found and corrections they'd made. Her enthusiasm was evident, her eyes lighting up as she talked about potential solutions to the contamination issues.

I was so caught up in watching her that I almost missed it-a black sedan making the same turns we did, maintaining a consistent distance.

"Brandon?" June's voice snapped me back to attention. "Are you listening?You look...distracted."

Instead of answering, I accelerated, watching the rearview mirror carefully.
The sedan sped up too.

"Brandon?" Now there was concern in her voice. "What's going on?"

"We're being followed," I told her.

Of course, she immediately twisted in her seat. "Oh my God,is that-are they following us?"
###Chapter 180: Who's in Brandon's Car?

**Brandon's POV**

"Oh my God, is that-are they following us?" June's voice pitched higher as she twisted in her seat, staring out the rear window.

I checked the rearview mirror, confirming my suspicion. The black sedan had been making identical turns for the past ten minutes-not close enough to be obvious, but consistent enough to be deliberate.

"Don't worry about it," I replied calmly. Without warning, I made a sharp right turn, cutting across traffic. Horns blared as I accelerated down a narrow side street. June yelped, grabbing the door handle.

I took another abrupt turn into an even narrower alley, weaving through Manhattan's lesser-known passages. Three more turns in rapid succession,each executed with precision. The sedan tried to keep pace but fell behind with each maneuver.

"Hold on," I warned, spotting an opportunity.I cut the wheel hard,sliding the car into a service entrance before immediately pulling back onto a main avenue heading ín the opposite direction.

June was pressed back against her seat, knuckles white. "Are they still behind us?"

She glanced back, then shook her head."No... they're gone."

I allowed myself a small smile, easing up on the accelerator. "Good."

I pulled into the underground parking structure of a shopping center and parked in the executive section. Once certain we hadn't been followed, I pulled out my phone and call the staff of a Diana shop.
"Yes," I said into the phone. "Bring down a set of clothes. The usual.Something conservative." A pause. "Five minutes."

Minutes later, a nervous-looking woman approached, carrying a garment bag. She tried to peer into the passenger window, though the tinted glass prevented her from seeing June clearly.

"The clothes?" I asked, lowering my window slightly.

"Yes. Mr. Stark," she said, extending the bag. "Exactly as requested."

I took the bag without comment, waiting for her to leave. When she lingered, I fixed her with a cold stare.

"Was there something else?"

She jumped slightly. "No! I'll just be going then. Enjoy your day,Mr.Stark.



Once she was gone, I handed the bag to June. "Here. Put these on."

June unzipped the bag, revealinga modest but elegant midnight blue dress with a matching blazer.

"Are we meeting someone important?" she asked curiously.

I nodded. "Go ahead and change."

Her eyes widened. "Here? In the car?"

I was about to respond when movement in my side mirror caught my attention. The black sedan that had been following us was cruising through the parking structure.

"Fuck," I muttered,my jaw clenching.
"What's wrong?" June followed my gaze, then sucked in a sharp breath. "They found us? How did they-"

"Lock the doors when I get out," I instructed, already reaching for the handle. "Change quickly. I'll deal with this."

June's hand shot out, grabbing my sleeve. "Wait, Brandon! You don't know who they are. What if they're dangerous?"

I turned to her, softening my expression slightly. "It's fine. It's just my mother. Stay in the car and don't come out."

Her worry immediately transformed into understanding. "Oh! Okay then.Be careful."

I positioned myself in front of the car, adjusting my cufflinks as I turned to face the approaching sedan. Through the windshield, I could see Jane Sinclair in the passenger seat, with Elle beside her driving. Jane seemed hesitant, likely sensing my mood from my rigid posture.

I remained where I was, making no move to approach them.

Elle's voice was barely audible as she said something clutched Jane's hand."He looks..."

"I'll handle this," Jane said, squaring her shoulders before exiting the car.

"Brandon!" she called,approaching with practiced grace.

"I thought I made myself clear, Mother," I replied coldly. "Some lines are better left uncrossed."

"Brandon,you misunderstand," she protested. "I was simply concerned.
When I saw you leaving Stark Tower so suddenly, I was worried about
you."

"Worried enough to follow me across half of Manhattan? With her?"I nodded toward Elle.


Before Jane could respond, Elle emerged from the car, rushing to join us.

"Brandon," she said breathlessly. "I only came because I thought you might need me. I'm your secretary, aren't I? If you're handling business outside the office, shouldn't I be with you?"

I turned my gaze on her, making no effort to hide my contempt.”Secretary? Interesting that you remember your position now. Leaving during work hours without authorization, following your superior without permission. Tell me, Elle, where exactly did your education and upbringing fail you? Or is this just your cheap, low-class roots showing through, no matter how much my mother tried to make you into a Sinclair?



Elle flinched as if struck, her eyes immediately filling with tears.

"Brandon!" she cried, her voice breaking. "How can you say such things? I can't help how I was born! If I could choose, don't you think I'd want to be a real Sinclair byblood?"

"And yet, you were given that chance, weren't you?" I replied coldly. "My mother and uncle took you in, gave you their name. Not everyone gets to clímb so rapidly into nobility. You should be grateful your mother had a wealthy ex-lover."

Jane stepped forward, flushed with anger. "Brandon, that's enough! Elle only cares for you. She has feelings for you."

"Feelings?" I repeated, my voice dropping dangerously low. "Mother,have
you forgotten every lesson in proper behavior? Elle is my uncle's adopted daughter-my cousin in name, if not blood. Even without shared genetics.surely you recognize the impropriety?"

"Brandon, you're being unreasonable-" Jane began.

"I've accommodated Elle's presence at Stark Group against my better judgment," I cut her off. "That was my final concession.If you persist in this... campaign, I won't hesitate to position myself against you-and against the Sinclair family if necessary."

I saw the color drain from Jane's face as I turned to leave.

Behind me, Elle rushed forward, grabbing my arm with desperate fingers."Brandon, please! Tell me what's wrong with me! Whatever it is, I can change! Is it my appearance? I'll get surgery-I'll look however you want!I'll look like Lyanna if that's what you prefer!”

I stared at her hand on my sleeve with revulsion,pulling out my handkerchief to wipe away her touch before dropping the cloth to the ground.

"You're deranged," I said flatly. "I've warned you not to touch me. The next time you put your hands on me, whichever hand it is, I'll ensure you never use it again."

Elle's face contorted, her eyes wild and red-rimmed. "No, Brandon, you can't mean that! It's because of her, isn't it? Lyanna? Or is there someone else now?" Her gaze darted to my car, her expression darkening further."There's another woman in your car, isn't there? Someone's seduced you!Who is she? I'll get rid of her right now!".

Before I couId stop her, Elle darted past me, lunging toward my car.
*What the fuck?*
###Chapter 181: She's Mentally Ill

**Summer's POV**

I crouched low in the back seat of Brandon's car, frantically changing into the elegant midnight blue dress. My heart nearly stopped when I saw someone rushing toward the vehicle.

"Open the door! I know you're in there!" a woman shrieked. The car shook as someone yanked violently at the door handles. "You home-wrecking slut, open this door!"

I froze, dress half over my head, panic shooting through me. *Elle Sinclair*.Brandon's "cousin."

Through the window, I could see her face pressed against the glass,contorted with rage as she pulled at the handle. Thank god Brandon had locked the doors.

Outside, a crowd was gathering, drawn by Elle's hysterics.

"Poor thing, that must be his wife," a woman commented loudly. "And he's got another woman in the car."

"Damn, that dude is gorgeous though," a younger voice chimed in.

"Honey, doesn't matter how handsome he is," an older woman called out. "If he's cheating, he's not worth it! Leave him now while you can!"

Elle wailed in response: "No! I won't leave him! Brandon, please, just make that bitch go away!"

Through the tinted windows, I could see Brandon standing rigidly nearby.his face a mask of cold fury. Jane Sinclair hovered beside him, her elegant
composure cracking.

"Mother," Brandon's voice cut through the commotion,glacial and precise."Is this what you wanted? Is this how the Sinclair family raised their children? Your precious niece? You've managed to destroy any remaining respect I had for you."

Jane paled visibly. "Brandon, Brandon! Elle is... you know Elle. Don't blame her. I'll take her away immediately."

She turned to their driver. "Quickly, get her into the car!"

Elle spun around, her face streaked with tears and makeup. "No! Get away from me! Aunt Jane, why aren't you helping me? Brandon has another woman! You promised I could marry him!"

The crowd's whispers grew louder.

Jane pressed her fingertips to her temple, visibly struggling to maintain composure.

"Get her in the car now!" she ordered the driver more forcefully.

The driver hesitated, glancing at Brandon for permission. Brandon gave a slight nod. As the driver approached Elle again, she twisted away, lunging toward Brandon. She reached for his hand, but Brandon jerked away, his disgust evident.

"My patience has limits," Brandon stated, each word like ice. "Mother,I have an important client meeting shortly. If I'm late because of this spectacle, I'll make sure neither Elle nor you can stay in New York. You'll go back where you came from."

Jane seemed to crumple. "Alright, alright, I'll take Elle away right now.
Brandon, please don't be angry. Elle's... situation... you know it's not her fault."


She moved quickly to Elle's side, whispering something in her ear.
Whatever she said made Elle pause.

"Really, Aunt Jane?" she asked, uncertainty creeping into her voice.

"Yes, dear. When have I ever lied to you? Now, let's go home."

I watched as Jane guided Elle to their car. The crowd, intimidated by Brandon's commanding presence, began to disperse.


Once Jane's car had disappeared, Brandon approached and tapped lightly on the window. "You can come out now,Summer."

I let out the breath I'd been holding and quickly straightened my dress,climbing awkwardly from the back seat.

"Why did you move to the back?" Brandon asked.

I felt my face heat up. "The front was too cramped for changing,"I explained. "It's all good now."

Inside the car,Brandon settled into the driver's seat while I fidgeted with my dress.

"Were you scared?" he asked, starting the engine.

I hesitated, then shook my head, then nodded. "I mean, not really. I was fine."

I glanced at him, struggling to find the right words. "But Elle seemed really..." I trailed off, tapping my temple meaningfully.′′mean,she was so emotional,completely unstable. Is she...?"
"Are you asking if she has mental health issues?" Brandon finished for me.

I nodded,relieved he understood.

"Yes," he confirmed simply.

"So what's her deal? She seemed really fixated on you."

Brandon sighed, his fingers tightening on the steering wheel. "Elle had a difficult childhood. Her mother was my uncle's first love-a woman with significant mental health problems, likely hereditary. The Sinclair family opposed their relationship, and eventually my uncle married someone else.Elle's mother also married, but things were unstable."

"Later, my uncle brought Elle into the Sinclair family and raised her.She seemed normal when she was younger, but in récent years, she's grown increasingly... obsessive."

"To you?" I asked. "She's been obsessed with you since childhood? That's why she won't leave you alone?"

Brandon's brow furrowed, and he nodded reluctantly. "Yes."

"And your mother knows about her condition?"

"She knows," Brandon confirmed, his voice hardening.

"And she's still trying to force you to marry her?" I couldn't keep the incredulity from my voice. "That's insane!"

Brandon didn't respond, and I sensed his mood darkening. After a moment of awkward silence, I decided to change the subject.

"So where are we going now?" I asked, glancing out the window.
"To pick someone up," he replied. If you want to know more about Elle,I'Il tell you1. but right now we have more important things to dlo."

He reached over, ruffling my hair affectionately.

"Hey!" I protested, swatting his hand away. "Don't mess with my hair!You said we're meeting someone important. How am I supposed to look professional with my hair all messed up?"

I pulled out a compact mirror, checking my reflection with dismay.

"Next time, don't touch my head without permission," I warned him.

Brandon glanced at me, a smile playing at his lips. "Alright," he agreed.

As we drove, I noticed we were heading out of the city center, toward more open roads.

"Where exactly are we going?" I asked. "Wait, this is... are we going to the airport? Are you picking someone up from a flight?"

Brandon nodded, his eyes fixed on the road.

"Who's so important that *you* have to personally pick them up?" I pressed.

"I initially asked James to do it," Brandon explained, "but he was urgently needed at Stark Entertainment. I didn't have any pressing matters today.so rather than dealing with issues at Stark Entertainment myself, I decided to handle the airport pickup."

I laughed, shaking my head. "Nice work delegation. Does Jamnes know you're throwing him under the bus like this?"

"I'm his boss,". Brandon replied with mock seriousness. "I pay him well to
solve my problems." Then he added, "But there's another reason. There's an issue with Victoria, and it wouldn't be appropriate for me to go there personally."


My head snapped up at the mention of my sister. "Victoria? What kind of trouble is she causing now?"


I hadn't been paying much attention to Victoria lately, too consumed with the Manhattan West Side development project.

"We don't have all the details yet," Brandon replied. "That's why James is handling it. But it's likely related to her filming schedule. She's been busy with that new movie, which means she hasn't had time to cause problems for you."


"True," I agreed. "James mentioned she's heading to Long Island in a couple of days. She'll be too busy to stir up any trouble."


"So who exactly are we going to meet?" I asked, unable to contain my curiosity any longer.
###Chapter 182: Summer Is With Me

**Summer's POV**

"Jean-Pierre."


"Jean-Pierre?" I repeated, my head snapping up as Brandon mentioned the name. "The chief engineer?"


Brandon raised an eyebrow, his dark eyes studying me with mild surprise."You know him?"


"Of course I know," I said, feeling a flutter of excitement. "Who in Manhattan's architectural world doesn't? Leo's been mentioning him constantly these past few weeks." I straightened in my seat, unable to hide my enthusiasm."I heard the last two commercial plazas Stark Group developed were his designs. His work on the Riverview complex was groundbreaking!"

A small smile played at the corners of Brandon's mouth. "I see you've done your homework."


"It's not exactly homework," I admitted, feeling slightly self-conscious under his steady gaze. "I used to study his work in my free time,and when Leo started bringing himn up during our Manhattan West Side discussions, I did some extra research." I shrugged, trying to appear casual despite my obvious excitement. "His approach to urban development challenges is pretty revolutionary."

Brandon's eyes softened with unmistakable approval, warming me from the inside out. Without thinking, I reached over and lightly squeezed his hand.
"So," I ventured, "is this you pulling strings for me?"

"If that's how you want to see it," Brandon replied, his voice taking on that velvety quality that always made my stomach flutter. He reached out.gently tapping the tip of my nose with his finger. "But remember, no matter how many resources I introduce you to, if you don't work hard yourself, it's all pointless."

I nodded, feeling both chastised and motivated. "I know that."

"You should talk to Leo about this," Brandon suggested. "He could give you valuable insights."

"Leo Schmidt?" I blinked in surprise. "He's already been incredibly generous with his knowledge. The way he teaches me about projects is practically professor-level."

"Jean-Pierre was his mentor," Brandon revealed casually.

My eyes widened. "Seriously? Leo never mentioned that!" I frowned slightly, connecting dots in my head. "Wait a minute..."

My phone suddenly vibrated in my pocket. I pulled it out. checking the screen. "Speak of the devil," I laughed, showing Brandon the caller ID. "It's Leo!"


I quickly answered. "Hello,Leo."

"Summer," Leo's voice came through, sounding slightly congested."How are those environmental assessment reports for the West Side project coming along? The ones I asked you to prepare this morning?"

"Leo, don't worry," I assured him. "I've organized all the materials and already handed them over to Mr. Stark. You should focus on getting better.
Heather and I have everything under control."

"I see. And what was Brandon's feedback?" Leo pressed.

I glanced at Brandon, who was listening intently. "Well... I just gave them to him, so he hasn't had time to evaluate everything yet." I held out the phone to Brandon. "Leo, I'm actually with Brandon right now. He'd like to speak with you."


Brandon took the phone, his expression shifting into professional mode."Leo, Brandon Stark here. I've received Summer's materials but haven't had a chance to review them thoroughly yet. From what I've seen,they appear satisfactory. I'll provide comprehensive feedback tonight. Take care of yourself."

There was a pause as Leo responded.

"Yes," Brandon replied, his tone cooling noticeably. "Summer is with me.Is that a problem?"

Another pause, then Brandon handed the phone back to me with a slight smirk. I barely had time to end the call before Brandon's phone started ringing. He glanced at it, then looked at me expectantly.

"Answer it," he instructed, nodding toward his phone.

I glanced down at the screen, seeing Monica's name flash across it. I turned the phone toward Brandon, silently questioning whether I should really answer his PA's call.

That's when I noticed his lock screen-a photo of me sleeping,my face relaxed, hair tousled across the pillow. My heart skipped a beat.

"Go ahead," Brandon urged, watching my reaction.
Face warmmng, - Swiped to alswer. neno?

There was a moment of startled silence on the other end. "Uh... who is this? Isn't this Mr. Stark's phone?" Monica's voice was a mixture of confusion and alarm.

"Yes, this is Mr. Stark's phone," I confirmed, trying to sound professional despite my flustered state. "Hi Monica, this is Summer Taylor from Projects.
Brandon's busy at the moment. Is there something I can help with?"

"Oh," Monica sounded momentarily thrown off balance. "Mr. Henderson's assistant just contacted me. They've arrived at the airport but haven't seen anyone sent to meet them. Are you and Mr. Stark at the airport now, Ms.Taylor?"


"Yes, we're at the airport," I confirmed. "We're waiting for Mr. Henderson."

"One of Mr. Henderson's bags has beena lost," Monica continued. "It contains important documents..."

"I understand," I cut in. "I'll let Brandon know right away. We'll go find Mr. Henderson immediately."


I ended the call and turned to Brandon. "Jean-Pierre is waiting.Apparently, the airline lost one of his bags with important documents inside."


Brandon nodded, but his gaze had fixed on my phone, which I'd absentmindedly placed on the console between us. His eyes narrowed at my lock screen-a photo of an actor I'd admired for years.

"What did Monica say?" he asked, his voice deceptively casual as he picked up my phone.
-Paus,and shapped a quick photo of us together.

"Brandon!" I protested. "What are you doing with my phone? If you want to take a picture, at least warn me! I wasn't ready! Give it back."

He handed it back with a satisfied look. I glanced down to see my lock screen had been replaced with the photo he'd just taken-both of us together, him looking perfectly composed while I appeared caught off-guard.

"Why did you change my wallpaper?" I demanded.

"Why wouldn't I?" he replied coolly. "Your phone lock screen can only be me, not other men."

I rolled my eyes. "It's just an actor I admire. Someone who literally doesn't exist in my real life. Are you seriously jealous of that?"

"No," Brandon stated firmly. "I don't allow it. From now on, your phone can only have my photo."

"You're impossible," I sighed, examining the new wallpaper more carefully."And putting your picture here basically announces our relationship to anyone who sees my phone. What happened to keeping things private?"

I squinted at the photo again. "Look at this! You didn't even tell me you were taking it. I wasn't prepared at all, but you posed perfectly. That's so unfair!"

Brandon simply plucked the phone from my hands. "To prevent you from changing it back right away, I'll hold onto this for now."

He stood, taking my hand firmly in his. "Let's go. Mr. Henderson must be
getting anxious."

As we walked through the terminal, I couldn't help muttering, "This is your fault. How did I get so delayed?" I paused, another thought occurring to me. "By the way, when did you take that picture of me sleeping? That photo is awful! I want to replace it with something nicer later."


Brandon leaned close, his breath warm against my ear as he murmured,"I think it's beautiful. You're most captivating when you're half asleep."

My heart hammered in my chest, heat rising to my face as I pushed him away. "Stop that. From now on, you need to keep your distance!"
###Chapter 183: You're Insane

**Brandon's POV**

"I'm done dealing with you!" Summer's cheeks flushed crimson as she quickened her pace, deliberately walking ahead to avoid me.

I smirked, lengthening my stride to catch up with her. "Alright, alright.Finding Mr. Dubois is more important right now."

Summer shot me a sidelong glance but kept walking. At the terminal,I spotted Jean-Pierre near baggage claim, gesticulating wildly at his overwhelmed assistant.

"Jean-Pierre!" I called, extending my hand. "Remember me?"

Recognition dawned on his face. "Brandon? Oh, they said someone would come to meet me. It's you?"

"My wife!" I replied in flawless French, gesturing to Summer.Jean-Pierre's eyes brightened immediately.

"Brandon, your wife is beautiful," he remarked in French.

Summer stepped forward. "Hello, Mr. Dubois. I'm Summer."

Jean-Pierre explained in stilted English that a bag containing crucial architectural designs had been misplaced.

Summer touched my arm. "I'll go check on the luggage. Why don't you take Mr. Dubois somewhere to wait? Maybe the coffee shop across the way?11

I handed her phone back. "We'll be at the Starbucks across the terminal.
Call me when you find it."

The Starbucks was predictably crowded, but we secured a corner table.Jean-Pierre wasn't alone-besides his assistant, a young woman accompanied them.


"Brandon, let me introduce Danielle, my student and the designer for this project," Jean-Pierre explained.


"Hello," I said with a polite nod, noticing immediately how her gaze lingered on me. I narrowed my eyes slightly, maintaining a cordial smile while ensuring my body language communicated clear boundaries.


"Mr. Stark," Danielle breathed, her French accent pronounced. "I've heard so much about you from Jean-Pierre. It's an honor to finally meet you."


I acknowledged her greeting before turning my attention back to Jean-Pierre, while feeling Danielle's eyes fixed on me.

My phone buzzed. "Summer," I answered.

"I found the luggage! Just waiting for them to bring it up," she reported. "How are things on your end? It's getting late-should we take them to the hotel first, or go straight to dinner?"

"We'll decide when you get back," I replied. "Monica has already arranged their hotel."


I turned to Jean-Pierre. "Good news. My wife has located your luggage.She'll be joining us shortly."

"Your wife," Jean-Pierre repeated, shaking his head. "Brandon,when did you get married? There wasn't a whisper of it anywhere!"
"Recently," I said simply.

"She must be special," Jean-Pierre probed, his eyes twinkling. "I've never seen you like this before."


"Yes, she's exactly who I've been looking for," I admitted. "She's exceptional.Meeting her was the luckiest thing that's ever happened to me.



Jean-Pierre laughed. "Brandon Stark, falling in love! I never thought I'd see the day."

Summer approached, pulling a small leather suitcase. Jean-Pierre jumped up. "Thank you so much, Mrs. Stark!" he exclaimed. "This is my treasure."

Summer smiled. "Did Monica send the hotel information?"

I nodded. already standing. "She did. Let's get going."

After settling Jean-Pierre and his team at their hotel, we headed to dinner at Per Se. The restaurant manager greeted us with excessive enthusiasm,practically bowing as he escorted us to the private dining room.

"Mr. Stark, we're honored by your visit," he gushed. "May I ask who your distinguished guests are? The chef would love to prepare something special-"

"That won't be necessary," I cut himn off firmly.

From the corner of my eye, I caught Summer rolling her eyes at my curtness. She stepped forward, her smile softening the interaction.

"Please ensure all ingredients are the freshest available today, especially the foie gras and seafood," she instructed warmly. "We'd also appreciate
"Recently," I said simply.

"She must be special," Jean-Pierre probed, his eyes twinkling. "I've never seen you like this before."


"Yes, she's exactly who I've been looking for," I admitted."She's exceptional. Meeting her was the luckiest thing that's ever happened to me.



Jean-Pierre laughed. "Brandon Stark, falling in love! I never thought I'd see the day."


Summer approached, pulling a small leather suitcase. Jean-Pierre jumped up. "Thank you so much, Mrs. Stark!" he exclaimed. "This is my treasure."

Summer smiled. "Did Monica send the hotel information?"

I nodded, already standing. "She did. Let's get going."

After settling Jean-Pierre and his team at their hotel, we headed to dinner at Per Se. The restaurant manager greeted us with excessive enthusiasm,practically bowing as he escorted us to the private dining room.

"Mr. Stark, we're honored by your visit," he gushed. "May I ask who your distinguished guests are? The chef would love to prepare something special-"

From the corner of my eye, I caught Summer rolling her eyes at my curtness. She stepped forward, her smile softening the interaction.

"Please ensure all ingredients are the freshest available today,especially the foie gras and seafood," she instructed warmly. "We'd also appreciate
appropriate privacy during our meal. Thank you."

After the manager left, Summer leaned close. "You don't have to be so serious all the time," she whispered.

"Whatever you say, Mrs. Stark," I replied, my voice softening.

Throughout dinner, I noticed Danielle continuing to cast glances my way,but I kept my attention firmly on Jean-Pierre and the business at hand.


"We've arranged a driver for you," Summer informed Jean-Pierre as we finished. "He'll be available tomorrow if you'd like to explore Manhattan before our formal meeting."

Jean-Pierre beamed. "How considerate! Your wife thinks of everything,Brandon."

"Yes, my wife is remarkable," I agreed without hesitation.

By the time we reached the Hamptons estate, it was late. Summer kicked off her shoes and headed straight for the bedroom, clearly exhausted.

"Go ahead and rest," I told her. "I have some work to finish."

I retreated to my study to review the Manhattan West Side survey data.I lost track of time until I heard a soft knock.

Summer pushed open the door, carrying a steamning cup of tea. "You're still working?"

I stretched, feeling the tightness in my shoulders. "Just reviewing the West Side data."

Summer picked up one of the sheets covered in my calculations, her eyebrows rising in surprise. "Brandon, you could literally replace Leo and
teach me."

I sipped the tea. "Is this new? It's good."

"My grandfather got it from one of his friends," she explained, still studying my notes.

"So who am I replacing?" I asked, amused by her comment.

"Leo." Summer pointed to a section I'd circled. "I mean I learned a lot from him, so... But seriously, Brandon, how come I never thought of your method? How are you good at everything?"

I smiled. "I was your grandfather's student in college,you know. You'd be surprised what he taught."

"That's exactly why I find it strange," Summer countered. "Oh, by the way,
I heard from Leo that he was also my grandfather's student. So were you and Leo old acquaintances?"


"Not really," I reflected. "Leo and I are about the same age, but I started college when I was twelve or thirteen. He probably wasn't that early."

Summer dramatically smacked her forehead, laughing. "Leo would probably cough up blood hearing you say that! He's already considered brilliant, but you're just..."

"I'm just what?" I raised an eyebrow, curious.

Summer grinned sheepishly. "You're on another level entirely. You're almost insane."
###Chapter 184: Partnering with Edward

**Summer's POV**

"Insane?" Brandon quirked an eyebrow, amusement dancing in his eyes.

"Well, aren't you?" I gestured at his meticulous notes. "You're not just a financial genius, but you're amazing at racing too-practically professional level. You're light-years ahead of me in everything."

Brandon shook his head, a small smile playing on his lips. "Everyone excels in different areas. Trust yourself."


He pulled my project designs toward him, his dark, eyes scanning the pages with laser-like focus, occasionally making small marks.

"These sections need attention," he said finally, circling several areas. "The rest looks good. Is Leo already letting you handle the entire workload?"

I blinked in surprise. "How did you know? But I'm not as good as him,not even close!"


"Don't sell yourself short," Brandon countered. "Leo simply has more experience, so naturally he deals with more complex problems. Areas like these-he'd know to avoid these issues."

"I actually wanted Leo to review these first," I explained, "but he hasn't been feeling well lately. He told me I could just show them directly to you!"

Brandon's mouth quirked. "How convenient for him."

I nodded, diving into the corrections. I became so absorbed in the work that I completely lost track of time. When I finally looked up, Brandon was gone.
With a sigh, I gathered the revised drawings and headed out. As I stepped into the hallway, I nearly collided with Brandon, who was fresh from the shower. He wore only a bathrobe loosely tied at the waist,a towel dangling from his hand.


"Finished with work?" he asked, his voice low.

"Yeah," then I asked, "So you weren't originally planning to hand off the Manhattan West Side project?"

Brandon shook his head. "Actually, I was."

"What changed your mind?"

Brandon took my hand. "Fortune Corp. They're trying to use this project to forge stronger ties with Stark Group."

I nodded. "I know that, but they're such a small company-not even in the consideration range."

Brandon moved behind me, his strong hands settling on my shoulders,kneading away tension.

"You were hunched over those designs for hours," he explained.

"I don't like when people try to leverage power over me," he continued."Old Alexander approached my grandfather.Gavin owes them a favor that needs to be repaid. My grandfather is traditional, and since Alexander carries the Stark name-certain courtesies are expected."

His thumbs pressed into a tender spot between my shoulder blades.

"That's the principle," Brandon continued. "But Stark Group has already shown Fortune Corp exceptiona1 favoritism. Despite this, they've shown no
growth. I don't believe they deserve more help. That's why I abandoned their proposal and sought outside assistance."

I tilted my head. "So you brought in Jean-Pierre because you've worked with him before, and Stark Group already knows him. Plus, partnering with an external designer maximizes benefits."

Brandon nodded approvingly. "Very perceptive."

"Oh. please," I laughed. "I'm just pointing out the obvious. You already calculated all this."

"What about the follow-up contracts?" I asked.

"You're forgetting about Edward," Brandon replied simply.

I spun around, eyes wide. "You're planning to partner with Edward Lee?"

The more I thought about it, the more it made sense. "That's brilliant.Working with Edward is infinitely better than partnering with anyone else.One Lee family is worth ten Fortune Corps. Even if your grandfather objects, he'll have to back down out of respect for Edward."

"Stark Group never specialized in this area," Brandon explained. "I was merely testing the waters. Edward has far more experience."

"How long will Jean be staying?" I asked. "The project hasn't even launched yet. Between phase one and two, we're looking at a minimum of a year. We can't expect him to live in a hotel that whole time."

"That's thoughtful," Brandon said, looking mildly surprised. "I overlooked that detail. You're right-Jean,can't return home. We need him for both initial and subsequent phases."
I leaned back against Brandon's chest. "I heard Jean is interested in New York? The day after tomorrow is Saturday-we could show him around."

Brandon's fingers combed through my hair. "Okay. Let's have James find suitable accommodations tomorrow. Hotel living isn't practical long-term.As for dining-doesn't your friend own a coffee shop? You could take him there. I likely won't have much free time this weekend. I need to visit Edward."


I straightened confidently. "Don't worry, I've got this covered!"




Saturday morning found me riding with James to pick up Jean. Brandon had already left for his meeting with Edward.

"James, tell me more about the place you found."

"It's one of the standalone villas from a Lee family development," James explained. "Mr. Stark rarely visits the property."


When we arrived, Jean was waiting with Danielle and his assistant.


"I never expected such thorough accommodations," Jean exclaimed. "I was just telling Danielle yesterday that we should look for a comfortable place.Hotel living doesn't suit me!"


"My husband arranged everything in advance," I explained. "The property needed cleaning and airing out, which is why we couldn't move you there immediately."

I helped Danielle with her luggage, lifting one of her suitcases into the trunk.
James hurried over. "Mrs. Stark, allow me to handle that!"

"It's fine," I said quietly. "And remember, in public, just call me Miss Taylor."


On the drive, I shared details about the neighborhood, showing Jean photos I'd taken.


"The area is quite nice-close to the city center but not too noisy. I think you'll feel right at home." Jean gave me an enthusiastic thumbs-up.

I laughed, nodding. "It certainly does"

"By the way, Mr. Dubois, I'd be happy to show you around."

"That would be wonderful," Jean replied. "Regarding work matters,I prefer to address those during business hours. What's your philosophy,Mrs. Stark?"

"I completely agree. Relaxation time should be dedicated to actual relaxation."

"However, Mr.Dubois, you can call me Miss Taylor."

Jean looked confused. "Oh? Why is that? Aren't you Brandon's wife?"

"I am," I confirmed, "but our marriage isn't public knowledge. At work, he's my boss-only in private is he my husband."

Jean nodded, seeming impressed. "A very independent woman. American women today are so independent-it's admirable!"

As we pulled up to the villa, I decided to make one more connection. "By the way, Mr. Dubois, do you remember Leo Schmidt?"
###Chapter 185: Reunion

**Summer's POV**

"Leo?" Jean-Pierre repeated, nodding thoughtfully. "He was my student,though he left France many years ago. You know him,Miss Taylor?"

"Yes!" I explained.

Jean-Pierre's eyes immediately lit up. "That's wonderful! I haven't seen Leo in so long. How is he doing these days?"

"He's doing great!" I assured him. "Leo's at Stark Group now, and he's actually my direct supervisor. He was supposed to join us today,but he's been feeling under the weather."

"No worries," Jean-Pierre waved dismissively. "We'll have plenty of opportunities to catch up later."

James slowed as we approached the security gate of the exclusive villa community. "1808, please," I told the guard, handing over the access pass.

The guard's eyes widened slightly. "Oh, Mr. Stark's place? Mr. Stark hasn't been here in ages."

I smiled politely and passed the card to Jean-Pierre. "This is one of my husband's properties. It's been vacant for a while, so you'll have total privacy. Everything's been prepared for your stay."

While James showed everyone upstairs to choose their rooms, I inspected the kitchen. The place was spotless, the refrigerator stocked with fresh groceries-Brandon's thoroughness never-ceased to amaze me.

I was checking the coffee supplies when a familiar voice made me freeze.
"Well,well,well! Look who we have here!"

Dr. Sean leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and wearing his trademark mischievous grin.

"Dr. Sean?" I couldn't hide my surprise. "What are you doing here?"

"That's my line, Mrs. Stark," he quipped, eyebrows rising playfully. "This place has been sitting empty for two years. I figured Brandon had finally decided to use it. Where is he?"

"He's meeting with Edward Lee today," I explained.

Sean gestured for me to follow him outside and pointed to a villa two doors down. "See that? 1806-that's mine. When Edward developed this area, he gave each of us bros a place. Mine's right there."

"So you don't live at the Sullivan estate?" I asked.


Sean laughed. "Is that really so shocking? Brandon doesn't live at the Stark mansion either!" He wandered back inside. "So what's the deal?Moving in? That would make for some entertaining neighborhood dynamics."

"Dr. Sean, I think you've misunderstood," I corrected him. "We're not moving in."

"No? Then what brings you here?"

I gestured toward the upper floor. "Brandon brought in a chief engineer from overseas who needs to stay in New York for a year. I thought a hotel wouldn't be comfortable for that,long."

"Sounds more like your idea than Brandon's," Sean smirked. "Not only
practical but saving a fortune on hotel costs. Smart move."

I narrowed my eyes but didn't deny it.

"Brandon really lucked out marrying you," Sean commented before stretching. "I should probably get going. Just finished my night shift, then had an emergency surgery this morning. I'm beat."

"Sounds rough." I sympathized, walking him to the door.

"Let's get everyone together soon," he suggested. "You, Brandon,Edward,the whole crew."


"Sounds good!"

When everyone finally came downstairs, I had prepared fresh coffee.

"Jean-Pierre, Danielle, would you like some coffee?" I offered.

Jean-Pierre took an appreciative sip. "I'm impressed, Mrs. Stark. Your coffee-making skills are excellent."

"You're too kind," I replied. "I'm just an amateur. If you want truly exceptional coffee, my friend is the real expert."

I glanced at my watch. "Would you like to explore the city? Have you had much chance to enjoy Manhattan before?"

"To be honest, not really," he admitted. "My previous visits were all business,"

"Well, since you'll be here for quite a while, you should definitely take advantage," I suggested. "Today I thought I might introduce you to some authentic New York cuisine."
Danielle looked uncomfortable. "If you don't mind, I think I'd prefer to rest. I'm feeling a bit under the weather from the travel."

"No problem," I assured her. "I've arranged for a personal chef if you'd prefer to stay in."




An hour later, Jean-Pierre and I stood outside Scarlett's coffeehouse.

"American coffee culture is truly fascinating," he remarked, admiring the charming storefront.

"Wait until you taste what's inside," I promised. "My friend that I mentioned is the owner. She majored in French, by the way."

"Is that so?" Jean-Pierre looked impressed. "You and your friend both seem like remarkable young women."

As we entered, Scarlett spotted me immediately. "Summer! You made it!"

She looked perfectly in her element-simple white button-up shirt, well-worn jeans, dark brown hair casually pulled back with a headband.

"Jean-Pierre, this is my friend Scarlett Smith," I introduced them.

"Hello,Jean-Pierre," Scarlett greeted him warmly.

"Bonjour, Scarlett. Je suis Jean-Pierre," he replied with old-world courtesy.

Scarlett led us to a special section away from the main seating area-a cozy nook she reserved for special guests.

"What would you prefer, Jean-Pierre?" she asked, gesturing to various coffee beans.
"I defer to the expertise of my host," he replied graciously.

My phone rang-Leo's name flashed on the screen.

"Hello? Leo?" I answered,surprised.

"Are you with Jean-Pierre today?" he asked. "Where are you? I'd like to join you."


I raised my eyebrows in surprise but gave him Scarlett's address.
Meanwhile. Jean-Pierre and Scarlett had slipped into French conversation.

Later, the bell above the door chimed, and Leo entered, his face paler than usual but his stride purposeful.

"Sorry I'm late," he said.

"You're not late at all," I assured him. "Jean-Pierre is just inside."

Jean-Pierre immediately stood. "Leo!"

"Jean-Pierre, it's been too long," Leo replied warmly.

I poured Leo coffee. "You really didn't have to come if you're not feeling well."


"It's fine," he insisted, though tension showed around his eyes.

Leo placed the cup down without drinking, and Scarlett approached quietly.

"Mr. Schmidt, may I take your coat?" she offered.

Leo seemed startled, as if only just noticing her. His steel-gray eyes fixed on Scarlett with unexpected intensity. There was a moment of charged
silence.

"Leo, this is Scarlett Smith," I interjected. "She's my good friend and the owner of this café."


Leo blinked. "My apologies, Miss Smith. Thank you."

"It's no trouble at all," Scarlett replied professionally,taking his coat.

As Scarlett returned to her brewing station, Jean-Pierre and Leo discussed the Manhattan West Side project. I contributed occasionally, but I was more fascinated by Leo's behavior-his eyes kept drifting to Scarlett, only to quickly look away when he realized I'd noticed.

I moved to Scarlett's side and gave her a meaningful wink.

"What?" she asked, looking genuinely confused.

I glanced back to see Leo hastily avert his gaze, and my smile widened."Nothing," I replied innocently.

Scarlett rolled her eyes and handed me a fresh cup. "I thought you came over because you needed something!"

I accepted the cup, watching Leo pretend to be absorbed in conversation with Jean-Pierre.*Well,well,well. This is an interesting development.*
###Chapter 186: The Taste of Waiting

**Brandon's POV**

The exclusive golf course was unusually quiet for a weekend. I spotted Edward immediately, lounging at a corner table on the terrace,sipping tea with casual elegance. Not exactly dressed for golf in his immaculate designer suit.

"You're looking sharp for someone who's supposed to be hitting balls,"I remarked as I approached.

Edward glanced up, his calculating eyes scanning me. "And you're dressed for golf when we both know you hate the sport." He gestured to the chair across from him."Tea?"


"Why not?" I settled into the seat. "Place is empty today."

"Isn't that how you arranged it?" Edward poured tea into a delicate cup."You're the one who calledthis meeting."

Edward reached into his jacket pocket and produced two premium cigars.
I took one but set it aside on the table.

"No smoking area," I explained.

A flicker of amusement crossed Edward's face. "Since when do you care about rules like that?"


"It's the weekend," Edward remarked, studying me. "I'm surprised you could spare the time."

"I couldn't," I admitted. "I didn't particularly want to come."
"Yet here you are." Edward's eyes narrowed slightly. "What's so important?



"Manhattan West Side," I finally said. "Are you sure Lee Group wants in?"

I rubbed my thumb against my knuckles. "I thought Lee Group would be an ideal partner in New York.Was I wrong?"


"Not wrong," Edward replied with deliberate casualness. "But you should know the current situation. The old man's been working to undermine my position, giving my brother piecesof my territory. Lee Group isn't entirely mine to command anymore."

"That sounds like an internal issue," I countered. "One I'm sure you can handle."

Edward fell silent, his gaze drifting toward the empty golf course. The wind rustled through the nearby trees.

"I have news of her," he said finally,his voice quiet.

My fingers tightened involuntarily around the teacup. "Katniss?"

He nodded once.

"And you want to bring her back?" I asked, feeling tension spread across my shoulders.

Edward met my gaze directly."Ido."

I set down my cup with more force than necessary. "You need to understand something. The person who hurt her most deeply was you,Edward. Her coming back might not be what's best for her."

My voice hardened. "If her return puts her at risk of getting hurt again,I
won't allow it. She's my sister in every way that matters."

"You've always been protective of her," Edward observed.

"With good reason." The memories surfaced unbidden-Jane walking out,the fights between her and my father. How Gavin and Meave had stepped in, becoming the parents I'd needed.


For years, I'd believed Zoey was Gavin's daughter, and I'd treated her accordingly. By the time I learned Katniss Kennedy was his biological child, she and Edward were already entangled in a mess too complicated to unravel cleanly.


"I understand your concern," Edward said quietly. "But you don't understand what it's like, Brandon."


He looked up suddenly, his eyes burning with intensity. "I've waited too long. You have no idea what it's like to wait for someone. I just want her back. Even if it destroys me in the end, I'd welcome it."


I frowned, rubbing my temple. This raw display of emotion was unexpected from Edward.

"You're my brother in all but blood," I told him. "But Katniss is my sister,and I won't let her be hurt again. If her return means facing the Lee family,how do you plan to protect her?"

Edward's jaw tightened. "I'll handle it.Once things are settled, she can come home."

I sat back, absorbing his words. *Waiting for someone*. The concept wasn't foreign to me. Waiting a year,waiting a decade-Edward had endured it all.
"Then expedite the Manhattan West Side project," I said, clapping him on the shoulder. "After that's handled, whatever you want to do with Lee Group is your business."


Edward smiled thinly. "Manhattan West Side won't be completed for at least a year or two. Are you trying to delay Katniss's return?"


My eyes narrowed. "Do you have a better solution? Do you even know where she is right now?"

"Brandon." Edward said, his voice tight, "someday when you're at my mercy, I'll make you feel exactly what I'm feeling right now."

"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," I replied with a slight smirk.

I tapped my finger against the table, shifting gears. "What about the other matter I asked you to look into?"

Edward raised an eyebrow. "You're that determined to uncover Summer's origins?"

"I don't just want to know," I corrected him. "I want to sever her connection to the Taylor family completely."

It was the truth. Without resolving this, my relationship with June would never be truly secure. The Taylor family was like a ticking time bomb.Their behavior toward June had always been strange. unnatural.

This was why I'd temporarily agreed to June's request to keep our marriage private. Once we went public, both the Starks and the Sinclairs would turn their attention to her, applying pressure from all sides. I wasn't entirely sure how June would handle that, and I never moved forward without certainty.
"What have you found?" I prompted.

Edward leaned forward. "It's highly likely that Summer isn't Elzabeth's daughter. Whether she's Richard's biological child is still unclear."

He paused. "What's particularly interesting is how Jonathan Thompson and George Taylor treat her. They both show her exceptional care, as if they're compensating for something."


"There's more," Edward continued. "George Taylor has transferred substantial shares to Summer. Meanwhile, Jonathan Thompson's will leaves all his assets to Summer, effective upon his death. Doesn't that strike you as odd? Elizabeth is Jonathan's daughter, and Victoria his granddaughter, yet neither is mentioned in his will. Only Summer."

I processed this information carefully. "What else?"

"That's all for now," Edward admitted. "If you want faster results, perhaps approach Jonathan Thompson or George Taylor directly."

I rubbed my brow. "Elizabeth and her father have a strained relationship.When I was his student, I did encounter Elizabeth once, but she wouldn't have recognized me."

"Focus on Professor Thompson and Elizabeth next," I instructed."That's our best lead."


Edward nodded. "I'll see what I can do." He glanced toward the golf course. "Care for a round, since we're here?"

I stood, mirroring his posture. Two equally matched forces, neither backing down. "Why not?"
###Chapter 187:Matchmaking

**Summer's POV**

I sipped my cappuccino quietly, watching Leo and Jean-Pierre talk with animated gestures across the table. The two men had fallen into a comfortable rhythm, discussing architectural concepts with an intensity that made me feel like I was eavesdropping.

"Lep," Jean-Pierre said, gesturing with his hands, "if you had stayed in France, you would have made an even greater mark on European architecture by now! Your understanding of sustainable urban development was years ahead of everyone else."

Leo smiled modestly. "That's not necessarily true. At the time, I had reasons I needed to come back to the United States. Even if I'd achieved greater success in Europe, I wouldn't have been happy."

I nearly choked on my coffee. This was surprising coming from Leo,who had always seemed so devoted to his work. I'd never imagined anything else could have pulled him back from a promising career in Europe.


"Oh?" Jean-Pierre leaned forward, eyes twinkling with interest. "Did you find this important person of yours? When you told me you were returning to America to find her, I thought it was just an excuse to leave."

Leo's expression darkened, his eyes dimming as he stared into his cup. "I found her," he said quietly. "But I seem to have lost her again."

An awkward silence fell over the table. I fidgeted with my napkin, unsure how to respond to this unexpected vulnerability.

"Leo," I finally said, "someone as talented as you wvill definitely meet
someone even better."

"Thanks," Leo replied with a forced smile. "But I'm sure she's doing well now, so it doesn't matter anymore." He straightened up. "Let's talk about something else,shall we?"


When Jean-Pierre excused himself to take a phone call, I seized the opportunity.


"Leo," I began casually, "Brandon's hosting a dinner tonight for Jean-Pierre.Would you like to join us?"

"I'd be honored," he replied.

"Great! Oh, and I was thinking of inviting Scarlett too. I don't want to be the only woman there."

Leo's expression shifted subtly. "Scarlett? Your friend who owns this place?



"Yes," I said innocently. "You two seemed to get along well."

I approached Scarlett at the counter. "Hey, are you free tonight? Brandon's hosting a dinner for Jean-Pierre, and I could really use another female presence there."

Scarlett wiped her hands on her apron, looking skeptical. "I don't know,Summer. I don't even know these people."

"Please? Leo will be there too, and I really don't want to be the only woman at a table full of men talking business."

Scarlett hesitated, then sighed. "Fine, but only because you're begging. And because Le Bernardin is impossible to get into without connections."
The elegant facade of Le Bernardin glowed softly in the evening light as we arrived. I'd chosen this restaurant specifically for Jean-Pierre-one of Manhattan's most iconic French establishments.

"Good evening," I said to the maitre d'. "We have a reservation for the VIP room."


He checked his list. "Ah, Ms. Taylor! Yes, of course. Follow me."

As we were led through the dining room, I glanced back to see Brandon,Leo, and Jean-Pierre following behind. Jean-Pierre was gesturing animatedly to Brandon.


"What about the Manhattan West Side project?"'I overheard Jean-Pierre asking. "Leo mentioned there are some complexities we should address."

"It's not overly complicated," Brandon replied smoothly. "We can discuss work matters tomorrow."


Inside the VIP room, I casually arranged the seating, placing Scarlett next to Leo. The sommelier arrived, and Brandon ordered an excellent vintage that Jean-Pierre approved with enthusiasm.


Throughout dinner, Brandon was attentive in a way that both warmed my heart and embarrassed me slightly. He carefully removed the shells from my prawns before placing them on my plate.

"Brandon," I whispered, "I can shell my own prawns."

He merely smiled. Across the table, Leo, Jean-Pierre, and Scarlett were engaged in animated conversation. Jean-Pierre and Leo occasionally lapsed into French, with Scarlett surprisingly joining in.
I jabbed Brandon gently under the table, nodding subtly toward Leo and Scarlett. They were sitting closer than necessary,and Leo seemed completely engaged in Scarlett's coffee dissertation.

Leaning toward Brandon, I whispered, "What do you think about those two?"


Brandon glanced at them briefly, then turned to me with a knowing smirk.Instead of answering, he offered me another perfectly shelled prawn. "Eat.



As the evening progressed, I watched Leo and Scarlett with growing satisfaction. They seemed to fit together naturally-both intelligent,passionate about their fields, and clearly enjoying each other's company.

When dinner ended, I saw my opportunity.

"Leo," I said casually, "would you mind giving Scarlett a ride home?Brandon and I need to drop Jean-Pierre off at his place."

Leo looked momentarily surprised, then composed himself. "Of course,I'd be happy to."

I caught Brandon's knowing headshake but ignored it, feeling quite pleased with myself.




"You're such a busybody," Brandon commented as we drove away from Jean-Pierre's villa.

"What do you mean?" I asked innocently.

"Leo and Scarlett. You couldn't have been more obvious if you'd pushed
their faces together."

I laughed. "Was it that obvious? You should have seen how he looked at her when he first walked into the café. He couldn't take his eyes off her!"

"You're getting in over your head. Matters of the heart are complicated."

"I'm not meddling," I protested. "I'm just... facilitating potential happiness.If they're not meant to be, they'll figure that out."

"By the way, how did your meeting with Edward go?"

"Fine," he replied simply.

"That's all I get? 'Fine'?" I raised an eyebrow.

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly. "What else do you want to know?"

"What's going on with Victoria then?"

Brandon's eyes remained on the road. "'She had some conflict with the film crew. Someone recorded it and is threatening her with the footage.Nothing major-James is handling it. So you don't need to worry about her causing you trouble for a while. She's busy enough creating her own problems."

"That's exactly how she is," I mused. "We grew up together, and aside from making my life difficult, she was always creating drama for herself too."

I thought back to our college days. Victoria had been universally admired by men for her beauty, but most women couldn't stand her. She'd constantly start rumors about classmates, manipulate situations to her advantage, and throw temper tantrums when things didn't go her way.
"She was never great at making female friends," I continued."Too competitive, too backstabbing. The guys never saw that side of her, of course. They just saw the beautiful face and perfect body."


Brandon reached over, squeezing my hand gently. "Unlike her. you're genuine. Your beauty isn't just what people see-it's who you are."

I laughed, leaning my head against his shoulder. "You're biased,but thank you."
###Chapter 188: Filming Wraps

**Sophie's POV**

"Water," Victoria snapped her fingers at the young assistant who'd been assigned to her. The poor girI jumped like she'd been shocked. "Room temperature.Now."

The assistant scurried off while Victoria dramatically flopped into a canvas chair under a large oak tree. The morning shoot had gone poorly. Director Thomas White had called for twelve takes of a relatively simple emotional scene, and with each repetition, Victoria's performance had grown increasingly wooden.

"You're not connecting with the character's vulnerability," he'd finally said,loud enough for the entire crew to hear. "Take five, everyone.Victoria,let's talk privately."


The humiliation had left her seething, and now someone was going to pay.
I knew exactly who the target would be.

The assistant returned, nervously offering a water bottle. Victoria snatched it, took a sip, and her face contorted with rage.

"What the fuck is this?" she hissed, rising from her chair. "I let you give me water, not fucking lava! Are you trying to burn me?"

"I-I'm sorry, Miss Taylor," the girl stammered. "I can get you another-"

"You think I want to wait for you to mess up again?" Victoria's voice rose sharply. "Here, why don't YOU try it if it's so perfect?"

She cocked her arm back, the water bottle clutched in her manicured hand.I moved quickly, sliding between them and pulling the assistant aside just
as Victoria launched the bottle. It sailed past us, splashing water across the ground.

"Hey, watch it!" someone called out.

I turned to the shaking assistant, speaking quietly. "Gotake a break,okay?I've got this."

"Thank you," she whispered, eyes welling with tears before she hurried away.

Victoria's glare could have melted steel. "What the hell do you think you're doing?"

"I should be asking you the same thing," I countered, keeping my voice deliberately calm. I walked to the craft services táble, poured fresh water into a clean cup, and brought it to her. "Here."

She snatched it, not breaking eye contact.

"Victoria," I said quietly, "this is a film set. There are at least fifty people watching your every move right now. You're Stark Entertainment's newest star, and after that incident at your birthday party, you're already on thin ice. Do you really want to addl 'abuses assistants' to your growing list of PR nightmares?"

Her eyes darted around, suddenly registering the staring crew members.

"I've told you before," I continued smoothly, "if you don't like this assistant,just let her go. That's why I'm here with you-I can handle all of this alone."

Victoria's shoulders slumped slightly. "I was just angry," she mumbled,taking a sip of water. "The director practically humiliated me in front of
everyone."

"I know," I said, adopting a sympathetic tone that made my stomach turn."But you have to pick your battles and your battlegrounds. She's not here this week, so I'm your buffer."


I leaned closer, my voice dropping. "You've just signed with Stark Entertainment. They're still evaluating you. Every tantrum, every difficult moment-it's all being reported back. Is that the impression you want to make?"


Victoria's eyes widened as my words sank in. I could practically see her calculating the potential damage to her career prospects.

"You're right," she admitted reluctantly. "Thank God you're here,Sophie.I'd be totally screwed otherwise." She glanced around nervously. "James Wilson already had to smooth things over for me once. What should I do?"

"Don't worry," I soothed. "Stark Entertainment's opinion is fluid. If this movie does well and your commercial value increases, they'll overlook a few rough patches." I lowered my voice conspiratorially. "I actually spoke with James the other day. Stark Entertainment is negotiating an endorsement deal for you. Once that comes through,you'll be golden."

Her face brightened instantly. "Really?"

"Really," I confirmed. "So focus on filming. Finish strong. That's your ticket."

Victoria nodded, her expression suddenly determined. "You're right. Even though Alexander and Brandon are related, business is business. Brandon won't give Alexander special treatment forever. I need to prove my worth."

"Exactly," I agreed. "Now, let's review your lines before the next scene. You
need to knock this one out of the park."

I signaled for the makeup artist to come touch up Victoria's face,watching her reflection in the mirror with satisfaction.

That evening, Victoria called Maya Coleman from her trailer while I pretended to organize her wardrobe.

"I want to let that assistant go," Victoria was saying. "Sophie's handling everything perfectly, and having two assistants is redundant."

I didn't hear Maya's response, but Victoria's satisfied expression told me everything. When she hung up, she turned to me with a smile.

"All taken care of," she announced. "Maya didn't even question it."

The next morning, Victoria paid te assistant her final wages and sent her on her way with barely a backward glance. As we watched the girl leave,Victoria turned to me with an expression of mock concern.

"Sophie, isn't this beneath you? Being my assistant?" Her tone was solicitous, but I could see the smug satisfaction in her eyes.

"Not at all," I replied smoothly. "Since I started working with you, I've found a certain peace. I needed something straightforward right now,something to keep me busy and not thinking about... everything else." I managed a small, sad smile that would have won me an Oscar.

"You're sweet to worry," I added, handing her a tissue. "Here, wipe that sweat before your makeup touch-up. I'll run through your lines with you while they work, so you'll be fully prepared for your scene with the lead."

Victoria beamed, settling into her chair like a queen on her throne."You know, everything has been running so much more smoothly since you
arrived."

"That's what I'm here for," I replied, flipping open the script with practiced efficiency.

*And you have no idea what else I'm here for*, I added silently.

Days past like this. And three months later, I stood on the sidelines of the set, watching as Victoria filmed her final scene. The director called "Cut!"for the last time, and the crew erupted into applause. The TV series had wrapped right on schedule.

As Victoria accepted congratulations and hugs, her gaze found mine across the crowd. She gave me a genuine smile and mouthed "Thank you."

I smiled back, raising my water bottle in a mock toast.
###Chapter 189:Seeing Summer Again

**Alexander's POV**

The Fortune Corp conference room felt like a pressure cooker about to explode. I sat rigid in my leather chair, feeling the collective glare of the board members boring into me. Lawrence, that backstabbing bastard,looked positively gleeful as he paced at the front of the room.

"So,would someone like to explain what the hell happened?"Lawrence's voice cut through the tense silence. "Mr. Stark, Alexander-one of you perhaps?" He gestured between my father and me. "Three months ago,Alexander assured us the Stark Group project was a done deal. Now we're learning Brandon Stark has chosen Lee Group and some foreign team instead."

My throat tightened. I'd only returned from my business trip a few days ago and had been swamped with year-end reports. The Stark Group project had seemed like a sure thing-my father had promised as much-and I'd stupidly taken my eye off the ball.

Lawrence wasn't finished. "I don't think Alexander ever took this project seriously." His thin lips curled into a smirk as he pulled out a tabloid magazine. "Take a look at this, everyone."

He put his phone on the conference table.My stomach dropped as I saw the photo-me and Victoria walking together in Long Island, her arm looped through mine as we exited a restaurant.

"Isn't your wife filming a TV series in Long Island, Alexander?" one of the directors asked, eyebrows raised. "Interesting timing for a conjugal visit,wouldn't you say?"
My father snatched the magazine from the table, his face turning an alarming shade of purple as he flipped through the pages. I could practicallysee the steam rising from his collar.

"Alexander," he growled, "would you care to explain yourself? While our company is losing critical business opportunities, you're gallivanting around Long Island?"

"Father, I-" I started.

"I told you in this company, there is no 'father," he snapped.

The humiliation burned like acid in my throat. I'd never seen him so furious in front of the board.

After the meeting, he practically dragged me to his office, slamming the door behind us. For a moment, I thought he might actually hit me-his hand twitched at his side before he controlled himself, likely remembering we were still at the office.

"Explain yourself," he demanded, jabbing a finger at my chest. "What the hell happened?"

"I don't understand what went wrong," I defended myself."My team worked around the clock for three months to prepare the perfect proposal.But how are we supposed to compete with Lee Group? They're ten times our size!"

"You were supposed to leverage our connection," he hissed. "William Stark gave me his word.He *owes*me."

"Well,clearly Brandon didn't get the memo," I shot back. "You said this was a sure thing!"
He paced his office like a caged animal. "That ungrateful líttle...after everything..." He stopped, seeming to remember I was there. "We need to fix this immediately. You'll go see Brandon directly and find out what's going on."

"And you?" I asked.

"Ill deal with William Stark," he said grimly. "But first, go get a read on Brandon. Test the waters before I make my move."




Walking into Stark Tower felt different this time. Usually, I strode through these doors with confidence-Alexander Stark, a name that meant something. Today, I felt like an outsider.

"I'm here to see Brandon Stark," I told the receptionist.

She offered a practiced smile. "Do you have an appointment,sir?"

"No, but he'll want to see me. I'm Alexander Stark."

"One moment, please." She picked up her phone, and I caught snippets of her conversation. "Yes... Mr. Alexander Stark... no appointment... shall I...?I see... Yes, I'll tell him."

She hung up and looked at me apologetically. "I'm sorry,Mr. Stark isn't available today."

"When will he be back?" I demanded.

"I'm afraid I don't have that information, sir."

Bullshit. Brandon was avoiding me-probably sitting in his office right now, laughing at my predicament. I decided to wait him out in the lobby.
He had to leave eventually, and when he did, I'd be ready.

Hour after excruciating hour passed. I watched waves of employees stream in and out for lunch, scrutinizing each face. Brandon never appeared. By early afternoon, my frustration had reached its peak, but I refused to leave.This project was too important-my reputation at Fortune Corp was on the line.

Then, just as employees were returning from lunch, I saw her.

Summer.

She was walking with another woman, laughing about something as they headed toward the entrance. My heart stuttered in my chest. She looked...incredible. Her skin glowed, her eyes bright and alive. She'd changed her hair slightly-it framed her face differently now-and she carried herself with a new confidence.

I stood frozen, unable to take my eyes off her. Several months had passed since I'd last seen her at Victoria's birthday party. She hadn't noticed me yet,still deep in conversation with her companion. Something about her seemed radically different-a lightness, a self-assurance that hadn't been there before.

As they approached the entrance, Summer finally looked up and our eyes met across the lobby. I saw the flash of recognition in her eyes, a brief moment of surprise crossing her features. She hesitated mid-step,saying something to her companion.

In that moment, watching her across the crowded lobby, an unexpected ache bloomed in my chest. Regret. Pure, unfiltered regret that crashed over me like a wave, threatening to drown out everything else-the project failure, my father's fury, even my marriage to Victoria.
###Chapter 190: Inside Information

**Summer's POV**

"So I toldI Leo I'd handle the environmental reports myself,and you should have seen his face!" Heather laughed as we walked across the Stark Group lobby toward the exit.

"I can imagine," I grinned. "He doesn't expect people to volunteer for extra work."


After helping Heather with a smaller project, she'd insisted on treating me to lunch as thanks. Brandon was in meetings all day, so I was looking forwvard to trying the sushi place she'd been raving about.

"There's this amazing sushi place just down the block," Heather said,scrolling through her phone. "They have this to-die-for dragon roll that's literally heaven."

As we pushed through the revolving doors, I stopped abruptly.Alexander stood near the edge of the plaza, scanning the crowd of employees. The moment his eyes found me, his entire posture changed.

"Summer? You okay?" Heather asked, noticing my sudden tension.

Before I could answer, Alexander was already walking toward us.

"Summer!" he called. "Long time no see!"

Heather startled. "Jesus!" She glanced between Alexander and me. "Who is this guy? You know him?"

I pressed my lips together, not hiding my displeasure. "Not exactly."
Alexander stopped in front of us, blocking our path. His eyes ran over me in that familiar way that used to make my heart race. Now it just annoyed me.


"Do you need something?" I asked coldly.

Alexander's brow furrowed, clearly taken aback by my tone. "What? I... I just come see how you're doing. Summer, we used to be..."

"Alexander," I cut him off, "if you don't have anything specific to discuss,would you mind stepping aside? Our lunch break isn't very long, and you're wasting my colleague's time."

Alexander glanced at Heather, then back to me. "Excuse me," he said formally to Heather. "You're Summer's colleague, right? Would you mind giving us a moment? I need to speak with Summer privately."

Heather looked at me uncertainly. I gave her a tiny head shake.

"Sorry," Heather replied, "but like Summer said, we're on our lunch break and we're kind of in a hurry. Whatever you need to discuss can wait."

"Summer," Alexander pleaded, "can't you just hear me out? Just for a moment?"

I sighed, checking my watch. "Fine. You have two minutes. Say what you need to say right here, and then we're leaving."

"I just... Summer, how are you doing at Stark Group? Are you settling in well?"

"Really? That's what you want to know?" I laughed. "I'm doing great-especially since I haven't had to deal with you or Victoria. Anything else you'd like to ask in your remaining minute and a half?"
Alexander flinched. "I'm glad you're doing well. Which department are you working in? After you left Fortune Corp,I thought-"

"Let's cut to the chase," I interrupted. "You didn't come to Stark Group today to check on my wellbeing. What are you really doing here?"

"I... I did want to see how you were doing, but also thought I'd ask about the Manhattan West Side project. You must be in Projects, and I figured you might know something about why Stark Group decided to-"

"Are you serious?" I cut him off. "You're trying to pump me for insider information? You do realize I work for Stark Group now, right? If I shared confidential details with you, it would be a violation of my contract. Did you really think I'd risk my position here just because you asked?"

Alexander's face tightened. "That's not what I meant. I just wondered why Stark Group suddenly decided against partnering with Fortune Corp. We were under the impression-"

"Against partnering?" I echoed. "When exactly did Stark Group commit to working with Fortune Corp? Or was that just something you assumed would happen?"

I glanced at my watch again. "Youar two minutes are up. We need to go."

I caught Heather's eye, giving her a subtle nod.

"Look, sir," Heather jumped in, "these questions are getting into confidential company matters. I don't know what your relationship with Summer was, but surely you understand professional boundaries. We really need to get going."

Alexander's jaw clenched, but with Heather there as a witness, he couldn't make a scene. I saw the realization dawn on his face-Stark Group had
never intended to partner with Fortune Corp on the Manhattan West Side project.

Without another word, he stepped aside, allowing us to pass.


---

"So, who exactly was that?" Heather asked as we walked toward the sushi restaurant. "That Alexander Stark guy is related to our Mr. Stark?"

"Probably," I said vaguely.

"There was something weird about the way he looked at you," Heather continued. "Like you were some prize he'd lost. And the way he tried to use you for information..."

When I didn't immediately respond, Heather stopped walking. "Wait, you weren't... involved with him, were you?"

I pressed my lips together. "No. He's my sister's husband. He was also my boss at Fortune Corp."

Heather's eyes widened. "Oh! That explains... not everything. He mentioned Fortune Corp. You worked there before Stark Group,right? So your relationship with him is..."

"Not good," I confirmed. "Why do you think I left for Stark Group? He probably came here to find out why Fortune Corp wasn't selected for the Manhattan West Side partnership."

By now, we'd reached the sushi restaurant. The hostess led us to a small tabole by the window.

"Fortune Corp never stood a chance," Heather scoffed as we settled into
our seats. "I mean, come on! We're working with Lee Group! Fortune Corp is like... a gnat compared to them. They're not even in the same league."

She beamed at me as she picked up her menu. "Remember,lunch is on me today! Order whatever you want-no holding back!"

"In that case," I smiled, pushing thoughts of Alexander aside, "I think I'll start with that famous dragon roll you mentioned."
###Chapter 191: Summer, Mr. Stark Would Like
to See You

**Brandon's POV**

"Sir, after Alexander was denied entry here yesterday,his father took matters into his own hands." James's voice carried a hint of amusement."Old Alexander showed up at the Stark mansion with several Fortune Corp executives in tow, demanding to speak with your grandfather."

I raised an eyebrow. "And?"

"Apparently, your mother intercepted them." James's lips twitched slightly."According to my source, Mrs. Sinclair was... formidable. She refused to allow them an audience with Mr. William Stark, claiming he was indisposed. When he insisted, she reminded him rather pointedly of his position within the extended family."

"That's interesting." I couldn't help the small smirk forming on my lips.Mother had her faults-many of them-but her ability to put people in their place had always been impressive.

"Indeed," James continued. "The confrontation ended with Old Alexander departing rather hastily. According to the staff, and I quote, 'his face was white as a sheet.' I must say, Mr. Stark, your mother certainly has a way about her."

Closing the file in front of me with a decisive snap, I looked up at my assistant.

"This matter deserves no more of our attention. Tell the engineering department I want the first phase of the Manhattan West Side project on the agenda as soon as possible."
James's brow furrowed slightly. "What about the bidding process,sir?Haven't we yet to begin?"

"Early next month," I replied.

"But sir, that's practically year-end," James poinited out, concern evident in his voice. "With Stark Group's annual celebration and the year-end banquet coming up, the timing seems... challenging."

I fixed James with a cool stare, my finger tapping rhythmically against the polished surface of my desk. "Are you implying that∗yOu∗need to handle these matters personally, James?"

The warning in my tone wasn't subtle. James immediately straightened his already impeccable posture. "No, sir! Absolutely not necessary."

He cleared his throat, clearly deciding to change subjects. "There's another matter, Mr. Stark." He hesitäted, then continued, "Elle Sinclair has been getting quite friendly with Monica recently. This is the tenth instance in three months."

James handed me a small box. Inside was an expensive-looking platinum necklace.

"She's been cultivating relationships with your key staff. Monica has been her primary target. For the past three months, Elle has been taking her shopping regularly."

I examined the necklace briefly. It wasn't ostentatiously expensive, but certainly not a casual gift either-likely several thousand dollars at minimum. The Sinclair name opened many doors, and Elle clearly knew how to leverage her family's resources.

"Give this back to Monica," I said, tossing the box to James. "Tell her to
continue the friendly relationship. Monica knows what information is appropriate to share and what isn't."

"Yes, sir." James responded, pocketing the box.

"What about Victoria Taylor?" I asked. "Any updates?"

"Her first production has wrapped, sir. She should be returning in the next day or two."

I narrowed my eyes. "No follow-up project?"

"Not at the moment," James replied. "It's year-end-most productions are either already filming or delayed until next year. I haven't arranged any new projects for Victoria either." He studied my expression. "Would you prefer she doesn't return yet?"

I shook my head. "Handle it as you see fit."

Tapping my pen against the desk, I made á decision. "Regarding the Stark Group annual celebration-have Monica and Elle take charge of the arrangements."

James couldn't hide his surprise. "Elle Sinclair? But sir, she has no experience with such events. I'm concerned she might-"

"She graduated from Georgetown," I cut him off. "She's not entirely incompetent. Besides, keeping her busy will give her less time for... other activities." My tone hardened, making it clear that Elle's recent behavior had not gone unnoticed.

"Understood, sir." James nodded and left my office.

I returned to the Manhattan West Side project documents,reviewing the
environmental assessment reports. Summer had done exceptional work identifying potential challenges and proposing solutions. Her attention to detail surpassed many of our more experienced employees.

My lips curved into a small smile as I glanced at my watch. 11:30. Time to call her up for our "project discussion."

\---

Summer's POV

Monica's voice came through clearly over the phone. "Summer, Mr. Stark would like to see you regarding the Manhattan West Side project.Could you come up to his office right away?"

I glanced at the clock on my computer-11:30 again. What was with Brandon and these mid-day "meetings" lately?

"Of course, I'll be right up," I replied, trying to sound professional despite knowing exactly what this "meeting" was really about.

As I started organizing my desk, Heather looked up from her workstation with a knowing smirk.

"Leaving early again, Summer?" she asked, eyebrows raised suggestively.

"I'm not leaving," I protested, feeling heat rise to my cheeks. "Just...stepping out for a bit."

"Uh-huh," Heather wasn't buying it. "This is what, the third time this week? Every day around lunchtime you disappear. Come on, spill-do you have a secret boyfriend or something?"

Before I could formulate a response that wouldn't sound completely
unconvincing, Leo emerged from his office, saving me from Heather's interrogation.

"Ahem," he cleared his throat pointedly, shooting Heather a cool look."Don't you have actual work to focus on instead of gossip?"

"Director Schmidt!" Heather's expression immediately shifted to innocent professionalism. "I wasn't gossiping, just showing concern for my colleague.Right. Summer?"

I seized the opportunity to address Leo directly. "Sir, I need to step out for a bit, but I'll be back very soon."

Leo nodded, his expression unreadable. "That's fine. Just make sure you're back before the afternoon session begins."

"Thank you, sir! I'll definitely be back by then," I promised,grabbing my purse and phone. "See you later, Heather!"

I hurried toward the executive elevator-the one specifically designated for Brandon's use. The timing was deliberate; Brandon knew most employees would be heading to lunch now, minimizing the chance of anyone seeing me using his private elevator.

Despite our careful planning, my heart still raced as I stood inside the elevator,watching the numbers climb toward the 27th floor. What if someone saw me? What if they started asking questions?

When the doors opened, I cautiously peered out before stepping into the hallway-only to nearlycollide with Monica, who was returning from the break room with a coffee mug.

"Ms. Monica!" I exclaimed, startled.
"Summer," she greeted me with a professional smile. "Mr. Stark is expecting you. You can go right in."

"Thank you," I replied with equal formality, though I wondered if Monica suspected anything. Brandon insisted she was the soul of discretion, but still...


I had just reached Brandon's office door when I heard Monica's voice behind me shift from professional to surprised.

"Ms. Sinclair! I didn't expect you back so soon..."

I froze for a split second, thena quickly pushed open Brandon's door and slipped inside, closing it ajar, I tried to see what was going on out there.
###Chapter 192: Irresistible Impulse

**Summer's POV**

"What are you doing?" Brandon's amused voice came from his desk."
Sneaking around like you're robbing the place?"

"Shhh!" I pressed my finger to my lips. "Elle Sinclair is out there!"

I could hear Elle interrogating Monica through the door.

"Who was that woman who just went in?" Elle asked, her tone dripping with suspicion.

"What woman?" Monica's voice had a slight tremor before she quickly recovered. "Oh, you mean the one who entered Mr. Stark's office? She's from the Projects department. Mr. Stark requested their presence to discuss project matters."

"Is there only one woman in the Projects department?" Elle pressed.

"No, there are several," Monica responded. "Why do you ask,Miss Sinclair?



"Who was that woman specifically? What's her name? How's her performance at Stark Group?"

I held my breath, waiting for Monica's response.

"Her name is Summer Taylor," Monica finally answered. "She's Director Leo Schmidt's assistant. Mr. Stark called her up strictly for work-related matters!"

"Is that so? Monica, don't lie to me. We're friends now, aren't we?"
"Of course, Miss Sinclair! You've been so kind to me, I would never lie to you." Monica's voice shifted to an enthusiastic tone. "Actually, now that I'm free, should we start organizing our thoughts for the annual celebration?I was thinking we could try something fresh this year!"

"That's a great idea," Elle replied. "Actually, it's almost lunch time. Why don't I treat you to lunch?"

"I'd love that! Just give me a moment to get ready."

I listened as their footsteps retreated, finally exhaling. When I turned around, I nearly jumped out of my skin. Brandon had somehow materialized directly behind me.

"Jesus!" I gasped. "Don't sneak up on me like that!"

Brandon smirked, wrapping his arms around my waist. I immediately pushed against his chest.

"Are you crazy?" I hissed. "We're at the office! Elle Sinclair is literally right outside!"

Brandon narrowed his eyes, then moved me aside. He opened the door,glanced out, then closed it. "They're gone."

"This is all your fault," I said, walking toward his desk. "Why did you call me up here anyway? What work do we need to discuss? Didn't we already cover everything about the Manhattan West Side project in the meeting?"

"You," he replied simply. He took my hand and led me to the sofa,pushing me down onto it. "If I hadn't said it was work-related,would you have come up at all?"

"Of course not," I crossed my arms. "We agreed-during the day at the
office, we're boss and employee. Only at home are we husband and wife.
You know Elle Sinclair is working here now. If she found out about us..."

I studied his expression carefully. "It's not that I'm afraid of people knowing about our relationship. We're married now, and I don't feel the need to keep it private like I used to. But if Elle Sinclair found out, I don't think we'd have a moment's peace. This is a critical time for the project launch, and I don't want anything interfering with that."

Brandon nodded, giving my shoulder a reassuring pat. "I understand.You don't need to explain."

He opened a food container on the coffee table, releasing the delicious aroma of freshly prepared food.

"It's lunchtime," he said. "Let's eat."

I laughed. "You called me up here for lunch? Again? I told you I can handle my own lunch!"

"When did you order this?" I asked, eyeing the spread.

"James did," Brandon replied, handing me chopsticks."Eat."

I shrugged in resignation. "Fine, but you need to eat too. And you can't do this again tomorrow. Someone's going to notice if I come up here every day at lunch."

Brandon frowned. "You've been so busy with work lately. Even at home,you never slow down. I have no choice but to create opportunities for us to see each other."

"I'm not the one who can't slow down at home," I shot back with a knowing smile.
Brandon placed a piece of fish in my bowl. "James said the fish soup is especially good today. Have an extra bowl."

I nodded, adding vegetables tohis plate.

As I cleaned up after our meal, I remembered something. "'I overheard Elle Sinclair mentioning materials from HR for the annual celebration.Is Stark Group's annual event coming up?"

Brandon paused while pouring water. "Yes, that's right. Are you interested?



"Not at all," I said quickly. "Those events are exhausting. I was just wondering if this is your way of distracting Elle Sinclair."

Brandon handed me water. "You're perceptive. She can't get close to me directly, but she's still causing problems. With year-end approaching, I don't have time for her antics."

"Makes sense," I agreed. "Keeping her busy means she won't be fixated on you. But isn't it unfair to Monica?"

Brandon's lips curved slightly. "What's this? Are you concerned about Monica?"

I rolled my eyes. "She's your employee, not mine! If you're not worried about her, why should I be?" Despite my words, I couldn't help thinking that Elle seemed like a ticking time bomb after what I'd witnessed three months ago.

"It's fine," Brandon assured me. "This is exactly the kind of thing Monica handles."

I suddenly felt a twinge in my stomach and placed my hand on my
abdomen.

"Are you uncomfortable?" Brandon asked immediately.

I nodded. "I ate too much."

Brandon chuckled, tapping my nose gently. "You always do." He moved closer and began massaging my stomach. "Here?"

"Mm-hmm," I confirmed, then pushed his hand away. "It's nothing." I pulled out a digestive tablet, popping it into my mouth. "See? I came prepared."

"Try one." I tried to place it in his mouth.

Brandon dodged, but I wasn't giving up. I climbed half over him,using one hand to hold his chin while trying to push the tablet toward his lips.

Brandon caught my wrist in a firm grip, his eyes narrowing dangerously.A shiver ran down my spine. I immediately tried to pull back.

"Um, if youdon't want it, I'll just take it myself." I quickly popped the tablet into my mouth, but Brandon's grip on my wrist remained firm.

"June," he said, his voice dropping to that low, husky tone that always made my heart race.

I turned my head away. "It's getting late. I need to get back downstairs."

I hurriedly adjusted my clothes and checked my appearance in a compact mirror. To my horror, my lipstick was smudged across my cheek. I shot Brandon an accusatory look, only to find him watching with satisfaction.

"This isn't funny," I scowled, pulling out a wet wipe. "I'm going back to work! This is all your fault." I cleaned my face. "You need to stop getting
so close to me in public."

"What are you worried about? Nobody knows," Brandon said,taking the wipe and gently cleaning my face himself.

*Why do I get the feeling Brandon actually wanted to have sex with me right here in his office?*
###Chapter 193

Summer's POV
Brandon's hands lingered on my face longer than necessary, the damp wipe cool against my flushed skin. His touch, as always, sent a familiar jolt through me. I hated how easily he could unravel my resolve with a single gesture. I gently pushed his hand away, attempting to fix him with a stern look.
"Enough," I said, my voice steady despite the heat rising in my cheeks. "I mean it, Brandon. We have to maintain boundaries here."
He leaned back against the sofa, his expression unreadable but a familiar spark of amusement dancing in his dark eyes. "Boundaries, June? We are past the point of simple boundaries."
"You know what I mean," I replied, smoothing my skirt and standing up to create some distance. "This—whatever this magnetic pull is between us—it needs to stay out of the office. We had an agreement."
Brandon stood as well, closing the gap between us in one fluid, predatory step. "The agreement was meant to protect our professional reputations," he murmured, his voice dropping to that low, resonant frequency that always made my breath hitch. "But sometimes, the air in this room gets too thin to breathe without you."
I opened my mouth to argue, but the words died in my throat as he brushed a stray strand of hair behind my ear. His fingers grazed my skin, and the spark between us ignited instantly. He noticed my reaction—he always did—and his gaze intensified.
"Brandon," I warned, stepping back, but he followed. His hands found my waist, pulling me flush against him.
"Summer," he countered, mirroring my serious tone. "The door is locked. The world outside doesn't exist for the next ten minutes. What is the harm in admitting that you want this as much as I do?"
"The harm," I whispered, "is that I can't walk back into a board meeting looking like I’ve been swept away by a storm."
"Then let it be a quiet storm," he said, his voice dropping to a dangerous octave. Before I could offer another protest, he captured my lips in a kiss that was both a question and a command.
I meant to maintain my composure, but the second his mouth moved against mine, my rational thoughts evaporated. The professional world, the looming deadlines, and the office setting all vanished, replaced by the overwhelming reality of him.
The intensity grew, a whirlwind of shared heat and desperate motion. Brandon led me toward the floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the sprawling city. The glass was cool against my skin, a stark contrast to the searing warmth of his presence as he held me close. Locked in each other’s embrace, we moved in a rhythm that was entirely our own—a silent, fierce celebration of the bond we shared.
The city stretched out below us, millions of lives moving in the distance, but in the sanctuary of his office, there was only the sound of our breathing and the electric pulse of a connection that refused to be ignored. It was a moment of absolute surrender, a release of the tension that had been building between us all day. He claimed my attention with every touch, every breath, making me forget everything but the way I felt in his arms.
When the intensity finally began to subside, we stayed like that for a moment, the city lights beginning to twinkle in the twilight outside. My heart was still racing, and my body felt weightless, anchored only by his firm grip on my waist.
"I need to get back to work," I eventually muttered, though my voice was hoarse and lacked its usual conviction.
"Wait," Brandon said, his tone shifting into something more protective. He stepped back, scanning my appearance with a careful eye. "You can't go out looking quite so... affected."
He reached out, smoothing my tangled hair with a tenderness that contrasted the raw energy of moments ago. He straightened my blouse and adjusted my skirt, ensuring every detail was back in place. I caught my reflection in the glass—my eyes were bright, and my face was still flushed, but the disarray was gone.
I took a shaky breath, trying to regain my professional mask as he straightened his own suit. "There," he said, stepping back to admire his handiwork. "Perfect."
He paused, then added, "I'll walk out with you. We have a meeting to attend, after all."
I nodded, still slightly dazed, and followed him to the door. As we stepped into the hallway and headed for the elevator together, my heart was still thumping, but my head was clear. No one would know what had transpired behind those locked doors, but the secret shared between us only made the connection stronger.
###Chapter 194: You Are the Only One

**Brandon's POV**

The elevator doors closed behind us with a soft hiss, sealing Summer and me inside the private space. I could still taste her on my lips,still feel the heat of her body against mine. The memory of what we'd just done in my office sent a surge of satisfaction through me. Summer stood carefully beside me, her posture slightly rigid, clearly still feeling the aftereffects of our sex.

"I'm going out," I informed her, glancing at my watch. "You should come with me."

Summer's eyes widened. "Go where? I still have work to do! If Leo and the others can't find me, I'll be in serious trouble!"

I suppressed a smile at her concern. Despite Leo knowing about our relationship, Summer was determined not to use our marriage for special treatment-a quality I respected, even if I didn't always honor it myself.

"Don't worry, it's business," I assured her. "You think your husband is the kind of person who can't separate work from personal matters?"

Summer narrowed her eyes, a flush rising to her cheeks."Aren't you exactly that kind of person? I still can't believe what you just did in your office!"

The memory of her pressed against the glass wall, her body yielding to mine, flashed through my mind. I paused, my finger hovering over my phone screen, and gave her a sidelong glance, a satisfied smile playing at my lips. Summer immediately averted her eyes, pretending nothing had happened, though I noticed how she subtly pressed her thighs together, as
if trying to hide the evidence.

I could only shake my head and dial Leo's number. "Director Schmidt,Summer doesn't have any afternoon work, right? I need to take her out for a while."

There was a pause on the other end before Leo replied, his voice tight. "No,she doesn't."




The sleek car sliced through Manhattan traffic, heading toward the bridge.Summer had been quiet since we left Stark Tower, her legs still slightly unsteady as she'd walked to the car. Her breathing had finally steadied,but I could tell she was still feeling the lingering effects of our encounter.

"So you said this was business?" she finally asked, breaking the silence."Where are we going? Don't tell me we're picking someone up from the airport again!"

I glanced at her, my lips curving upward. "Summer, you're very perceptive."

Her face fell immediately. "What does being perceptive have to do with anything? I'm saying you're the CEO of a major corporation now-is it really necessary for you to personally pick people up from the airport every time? Who's the VIP this time?"

"You'll find out when we get there," I replied, unable to hide my amusement at her frustration.

Summer sighed, apparently accepting that I wouldn't reveal more, and turned her attention to her phone. She shifted slightly in her seat, subtly adjusting her position to alleviate what I assumed was the lingering
sensation from our office activities. The movement was small, but I noticed-of course I noticed everything about her.

She became absorbed in her phone, her fingers flying over the screen as she texted,completely forgetting my presence. A smile played on her lips as she read something, and she let out a quiet laugh.

I cleared my throat, trying to regain her attention, but she merely hummed in acknowledgment without looking up. After my third attempt at conversation was met with another distracted response, I decided on a more direct approach.

I reached over, my hand moving across her vision, and she finally looked up.

"Are we there?" she asked, glancing around before frowning. "We're still on the highway. Why are you interrupting me?"

"What are you playing with? You seem happy," I asked, my eyes flicking to her screen."What's that?"

"It's a messaging app," she explained, giving me a quizzical look. "Don't tell me you've never used WhatsApp before!"

I pressed my lips together. "I've heard of it, but I don't have an account."


Summer burst into laughter. "Seriously? That's hilarious!"

I narrowed my eyes, and Summer immediately sensed the shift in atmosphere. Her laughter died abruptly.

"Um... wel1," she said hastily. "I don't have many friends on it. just Ruby and Scarlett and a few others. Brandon, would you like to chat with me on it too?"
My expression softened at her attempt to include me. and Summer visibly relaxed when she saw the tension leave my face.

"Give me your phone," she said, holding out her hand.

"It's in my pocket. Get it yourself," I replied.

Summer reached into my jacket pocket, her fingers brushing against my chest as she retrieved my phone. While she was busy setting up the app on my device, I took the opportunity to examine her phone. A message from Ruby caught my attention: "When are you going to let me be a godmother?"

I glanced at Summer, who was completely focused on configuring my phone. Without hesitation, I typed a response: "Brandon says he wants to have a whole soccer team worth of kids!"

Almost immediately, the screen exploded with notifications. Ruby's responses were particularly colorful, with language that even I found surprisingly explicit. Scarlett's messages were more restrained.

"Done!" Summer announced proudly, unaware of what I'd been doing."T've updated some apps and installed WhatsApp for you."

"Your phone," she said, extending my device toward me with a trembling hand. "I installed WhatsApp and updated your other apps. Can I... have my phone back?"

I smirked, my eyes gleaming with amusement. "WhatsApp requiresan account, right? Did you create one for me?"

"Yes, I used your phone number," she replied quickly.

"Did you add yourself as my contact?"
Summer nodded vigorously. "I added you first thing! That's why I need my phone back-I have to accept your friend request."

I handed her phone back, watching as she frantically navigated to the friend request screen and approved my contact. She held up her phone triumphantly.

"See? I even gave you a special category," she said, her tone placating."You're the only one in this category, and it's at the very top of my list!"

I nodded in satisfaction but couldn't resist teasing her. "It seems my wife doesn't love me enough."

"That's ridiculous!" Summer protested. "Look, you're the only one in this entire category. How is that not enough love?"

I met her eyes, my voice softening. "But in my WhatsApp, it's not just one category-you're the only contact in mny entire friends list."
###Chapter 195: Ethan Kennedy

**Summer's POV**
"Pfft!" I couldn't help myself. The sound burst from my lips before I could stop it.

Brandon glanced at me, his fingers steady on the steering wheel. "What's that supposed to mean? Something funny?"

I felt the laughter bubbling inside me.

I stared at him in silence. The worst part was, he wasn't even joking.

His fingers drummed lightly on the steering wheel. "Why so quiet? Are you mad?"

"I honestly don't know what to say to that," I pressed my lips together,fighting both annoyance and amusement. "Just drive the car, please."

I looked down at my phone, scrolling through my messages. That's when I noticed something odd in my group chat with Ruby and Scarlett.

My eyes widened. "Brandon Stark! What did you write in my group chat?"

He gave me an innocent look. "I didn't say anything. That was all your friends."

"Yeah, right," I scoffed, scrolling frantically through the conversation. My heart practically stopped when I saw the message sent from my account: *"Brandon says he wants to have a whole soccer team worth of kids!"*

The responses from Ruby and Scarlett were... colorful, to say the least.Ruby had immediately sent a string of shocked emojis followed by:
*"WHAT THE ACTUAL F***?!! A SOCCER TEAM?? Girl, is he SERIOUS?Your body isn't a damn baby factory! Tell Mr. CEO to keep his swimmers in check unless HE wants to carry those kids!"*

And then:

*"OMG wait are you pregnant right now?? SUMMER TAYLOR ANSWER ME!!"*

My face burned with heat. God, if they knew what Brandon and I had just done in his office... The memory flashed through my mind-me pressed against that window, Brandon's hands gripping my hips...

"Brandon!" I hissed. "You are officially banned from touching my phone.Ever.Again."

"Why?" he asked. "You just used mine. You can look at my phone anytime you want."

I rubbed my temples. "It's not aboutthe phone itself. There are some jokes you just don't make. Now they're going to tease me about this for months."

Brandon leaned over, brushing his cheek against mine at a red light. "I was just kidding around. I won't do it again, okay? Don't be angry."

"I'm not angry," I insisted, melting at his touch.

"Hey, I should add some friends to your WhatsApp," I suggested. "Sean and Edward must have accounts."

"They probably don't," Brandon cut me off. "I don't have time for these things.Having you is enough."
Half an hour later, we pulled into the airport. Brandon looked impeccable as always, his tailored suit making him look like he'd stepped off a magazine cover.

As we approached the arrivals area, I spotted a familiar figure.

"Sean?" I called out, surprised. I turned to Brandon. "Did you come together?"

Sean looked up, tucking his phone away with a grin.

"How come you're here too?" Brandon asked, eyeing Sean with suspicion.

Sean raised his eyebrows, clapping a hand on Brandon's shoulder. "What,you're allowed to come, but I'm not? That's how it is now?"

He turned to me. "Hey there, Summer! Looking gorgeous as always."

"Hi, Sean," I greeted him with a smile.

"So who exactly are we meeting?" I asked, glancing between them.

Sean said cheerfully. "You'll find out soon enough. And Brandon,you sneaky bastard, running off without telling me or Edward."

"Like you're any better," Brandon retorted.

"Wait, is this the other one of you guys?" I guessed.

Brandon's lips curved into a small smile. "We are indeed picking up Mr.Kennedy."

"You can call him 'big brother,'" Brandon added, his voice softening. "He's rarely in New York-he's been abroad for years. Since he heard I got married, I thought I should bring you to meet him."
"I'd like that," I nodded, genuinely excited.

Brandon pulled me into his arms right there in the terminal, ignoring the curious stares. I spotted someone lifting a camera phone in our direction,but a single icy glare from Brandon made them lower it immediately.

"God, my eyes," Sean groaned dramatically. "Could you two maybe tone down the PDA? Some of us single folks are suffering here."

"Ignore him," Brandon murmured. "He's just jealous."

"Where's Edward?" Brandon asked.

"He had something come up," Sean explained. "But he's already reserved a private room at Manhattan Club for tonight. Said we should aIl be there to welcome Ethan back properly."

Brandon nodded. "I was thinking the same thing." He turned to me. "You'Il come with me tonight."

"Are you sure?" I hesitated. "It's been so long since you guys have seen each other. I don't want to intrudde."

Brandon chuckled. "You're overthinking. It won't just be us-others will be there too."

"Wait," I realized. "Won't they know about us then? Are you okay with that?"

"It's fine," heassured me. "They're all trustworthy."

Sean made a tsking sound. "Man, if I'd known you lovebirds were coming together, I wouldn't have rushed here straight from surgery."

"Sounds like I'm not wanted."
The deep, rich voice came from behind Sean, who froze instantly. Sean's face morphed into an awkward smile as he turned around.

"Hey, Ethan! Long time no see, buddy!"

The man standing behind Sean was nothing short of breathtaking. Dressed in an impeccable black suit, he carried a coat over one arm and a small leather suitcase in the other. He was even taller than Sean, and his presence seemed to command the entire terminal.

His dark eyes regarded Sean with cool amusement. "Still the same after all these years,I see."

Then his gaze shifted, landing first on Brandon, then on me. His expression changed subtly-curiosity replacing mild disdain.

"Brandon," he said, his lips curving into a slight smile. "It's been a while."Then he looked directly at me. "Aren't you going to introduce us?"

"It has been a long time," Brandon agreed. Then he placed his arm around my waist, drawing me closer."This is my wife,Summer."

I stared at Ethan, momentarily speechless. He was strikingly beautiful, his features almost too perfect, with a refinement that bordered on delicate without seeming feminine. Where Brandon was all dark intensity, Ethan had an almost ethereal quality-though no less powerful for it.

I suddenly realized I'd been silently staring, and all three men were now looking at me. Brandon's arm tightened around my waist, his fingers giving me a not-so-gentle pinch.

"Summer, this is Ethan Kennedy," Brandon said, a slight edge to his voice."You can call him 'big brother."
I snapped back to reality, feeling my cheeks heat up. "Oh! Um, hello Ethan.
I'm Summer!"
###Chapter 196: He Seems So Different

**Summer's POV**

I extended my hand toward Ethan Kennedy, suddenly feeling nervous.The man before me was impossibly perfect-tall, elegant, with features so symmetrical they seemed unreal.

Ethan gave a slight nod, reaching out to shake my hand briefly.

"It's a pleasure to finally meet you," he said, his voice deep and melodic. "P ve heard Brandon got married, but I've been too busy to return to New York until now. My apologies for the delay."

"Oh,no need to apologize!" I replied, trying to sound casual despite feeling like I was meeting royalty.

As I pulled my hand back, I noticed the spot where Brandon had pinched me earlier. Unable to resist, I reached over and gave him a quick pinch right back, then shot him a challenging look. That'll teach you.

I caught both Ethan and Sean exchanging amused glances. Sean seemed used to our antics, but Ethan's expression betrayed mild surprise at my boldness-and Brandon's tolerance of it.

"Shall we go?" Ethan suggested.

Brandon nodded. "I had your villa prepared when I heard you were coming back. Though I'm not sure how comfortable it'll be after being vacant for so long."

"It doesn't matter," Ethan replied with a dismissive wave. "It's just a temporary stop. I won't be staying in New York long anyway."
As we started walking through the terminal, Ethan and Brandon naturally fell into sep together at the front, immediately launching into business talk.Their voices dropped to a murmur, leaving Sean and me trailing behind.

"So that's the famous Ethan Kennedy," I whispered to Sean. "He seems...intense. You guys all act like he's some kind of god or something."

Sean raised an eyebrow, his mouth quirking into an amused smile. "Let me put it this way-two Brandons combined couldn't take Ethan in a fight. That's how formidable he is."

My eyes widened with genuine shock. "Are you serious?"

I remembered how easily Brandon had held me with one arm that night at the Manhattan Club when I was drugged. For Sean to claim that two Brandons wouldn't be enough to handle Ethan seemed almost impossible to believe.

"Dead serious," Sean confirmed. "Hell, Brandon and Edward Lee together wouldn't stand a chance against him. If you want the full story on his background, ask your husband sometime."

He glanced ahead before continuing, "Ethan actually saved my life once.years ago."

Then Sean's expression turned teasing. "But don't tell me you've got the hots for him now, Mrs. Stark. I should warn you, Ethan's standards are sky-high. In all the years I've known him, not a single woman has ever caught his interest."

I rolled my eyes. "Are you serious right now? What the hell is wrong with your brain? I'm Brandon's wife-why would I be interested in Ethan?I was just curious because he seems so... different."
"Yeah, right," Sean scoffed. "Your eyes practically popped out of your head when you first saw him. You didn't see Brandon's face-I'm prettysure he wanted to murder Ethan on the spot."

"That's ridiculous!" I protested, feeling my cheeks heat up. "I was just...appreciating aesthetics!"

Sean opened his mouth to respond, but I cut him off."You know,I wonder what Brandon or Ethan would think if I told them what you're implying right now..."

Sean's hands shot up in immediate surrender. "Whoa, whoa! I was just joking around!"

Brandon glanced back over his shoulder. "What are you two whispering about back there?"

I quickened my pace to catch up, flashing a bright smile. "Nothing important! Sean was just saying how jealous he is of us."

The corner of Brandon's mouth twitched upward as he shotSean a questioning look. "Is that so?"

Sean's expression was a masterpiece of resignation. "Yeah, absolutely.Every lonely single guy is jealous of you two lovebirds."

When we reached the parking lot, we split into two cars. Ethan casually slid into Sean's vehicle since his place was apparently near Sean's, while Brandon and I headed to our own car.

Once we were alone, I couldn't contain my curiosity any longer.

"So what's the deal with Ethan?" I asked as Brandon pulled onto the highway. "Sean was being super weird about him. Said he's practically
superhuman or something."

After my excited rambling, Brandon responded with a single question:"You seem very interested in Ethan,"

"What? No!" I shook my head vigorously. "It's just that Sean said he's so incredible that even you and Edward together couldn't beat him in a fight.That's... hard to belleve."

Brandon raised an eyebrow, "So you don't think I'm being honest about my capabilities?"

"That's not what I meant!" I backpedaled frantically. "Of course I trust you,Brandon!" My nervous laughter betrayed me as I menfally cursed myself.

Brandon watched my internal struggle before breaking into a genuine laugh,reaching over to ruffle my hair. "Relax. I'm just messing with you.Did I scare you?"

"No," I lied, swatting his hand away.

His smile lingered. "Sean wasn't exaggerating. Ethan is that good. Even Edward and I together would have trouble against him."He said it matter-of-factly, without any hint of wounded pride.

I leaned over and squeezed his hand supportively. "Well, I still think you're amazing. And I bet there are plenty of things you're better at than him.Like racing-I bet you're a better driver, right?"

Brandon's eyes softened as he glanced at me, reaching over to stroke my head gently. "You're right. He's not better than me at everything."

I beamed at him, my eyes crinkling with genuine happiness. "I knew it!You're still the best to me."
We arrived at Ethan's villa as dusk was settling. The property was stunning-apparently one of several houses in an exclusive development by Edward Lee. Brandon had mentioned that Edward owned four of the properties himself, with only three others in the entire community.

After helping Ethan bring his luggage inside and making sure everything was in order, Brandon checked his watch. "We should head out," he said."
Manhattan Club tonight?"

Ethan nodded. "I'll go with Sean. We'll see you there."
###Chapter 197: Never to Meet Again

**Sean's POV**

I kicked the door shut behind us as Ethan strode into my place likehe owned it. Same old Ethan-years abroad hadn't changed him one bit. Still carried himself like some kind of royalty, observing everything with those unnervingly calm eyes.

"Looks like youi've been doing well for yourself," he commented, taking in my living room with that subtle hint of approval I'd always craved from him back in the day.

"What,you thought I'd still be living like a broke med student?" I shot back with a grin, heading to the kitchen to grab some water. "Some of us actually evolved while you were gone."

I handed him a glass of filtered water-because God forbid Ethan Kennedy drink straight from the tap like us peasants. "So how long are you staying in New York this time? Your villa's been empty so long I'm surprised squirrels haven't claimed it."

Ethan's eyes narrowed slightly. "Why do you ask?"

"Just curious," I shrugged, flopping down on my couch. "And speaking of being curious, where's your shadow? That woman who's usually glued to your side? Don't tell me you finally shook her off."

Something flickered in Ethan's eyes-a ripple in the calm pond of his perpetual poker face. "You seem awfully interested in her."
"Whoa, easy there," I backpedaled, holding up my hands. "Just making small talk! She had quite the personality. Just wondering why she didn't
tag along this time. Got otherbusiness to handle?"

"That's none of your concern," Ethan replied flatly, setting his glass down."Instead of worrying about my affairs, perhaps you should be more concerned about yours."

My smile froze. "You saw Alice?"

Ethan took a deliberate sip of water. "Briefly. A chance encounter,you could say."

I forced my smile wider, trying to mask the sudden tightening in my chest.
"A chance encounter? You, Ethan Kennedy, just happened to run into her? That's quite the coincidence."

"Ask whatever it is you want to ask," Ethan said, cutting through the bullshit as usual.

He rose from his seat, moving to a quieter corner of my living room.choosing a spot by the floor-to-ceiling windows. Outside, winter had stripped the trees bare, the gray landscape matching the heaviness settling in my chest.

Ethan's long fingers absently rubbed the spot between his thumb and index finger-his tell when he was thinking carefully about his next words.He pulled out a cigarette, holding it between two fingers without lighting it.

"She looks well," he finally said, his gaze fixed on the bleak landscape outside. "I didn't approach her. She appears to be... married now."

The words hit me like a physical blow. My face-usually so quick with a smile or a joke-felt frozen. My hands clenched into fists sotight my knuckles turned white.
I forced myself to smirk, meeting Ethan's steady gaze. "Really?"

"You don't seem pleased to hear she's doing well," he observed.

I stretched my lips into something resembling a smile. "Why wouldn't I be?



*Of course I'm not happy. She's married. She's moved on. She's happy without me. It's the best possible ending for her-and probably the best outcome for us both-but fuck if it doesn't feel like someone's twisting a knife in my chest.*

Ethan's gaze drifted back to the window. "Good. Some things aren't meant for people like you and me. There's no point in dwelling on what can't be yours. You're the one who let her go, so it's time to stop holding on. That s actually why I came back-to tell you she's doing fine, so you can finally move on with your life too."

I let out a cold laugh. "How fucking thoughtful of you. I'm not hung up on her, if that's what you're implying. If she's happy, great. If not... well.that's not my problem anymore, is it? You don't need to test me like this,Ethan. When it comes to being heartless, I couldn't hold a candle to you."

Ethan glanced up at me, something like pity flickering in his eyes.

His long fingers rolled the unlit cigarette thoughtfully. "I haven't told Brandon about this. He probably wouldn't want her back."

I forced a smirk. "Then why tell me? She was nothing more than a fling.When she left, whatever we had ended. Period."

I sucked in a sharp breath, my lungs suddenly feeling too tight.

"What time are we heading to MIanhattan Club tonight?" Ethan asked,
smoothly changing the subject.

"Eight should work," I replied. "Let the place get warmed up first."

"T'll go upstairs and rest for a bit," he said, patting my shoulder briefly before heading up to the guest room.

I stared at his retreating figure, feeling the smile slide off my face like melting wax. Following his earlier gaze, I looked out at the barren trees.dead leaves scattered across the ground, occasionally stirred by random gusts of wind.

The scene transported me back to another winter day, just as bleak, just as cold. I'd been about fifteen, skipping classes from med school, feeling like the king of the world after a day of teenage rebellion. On my way back to campus.I heard crying-soft, desperate sobs coming from up in a tree.

It was a young girl's voice, heartbroken and afraid.

I wasn't the type to get involved in other people's problems-never had been-but something pulled me into that park that day. I found myself standing beneath a massive oak tree, looking up at a little girl clinging precariously to a branch.

I still remembered how she looked: not at all pretty, face streaked with tears,snot running from her nose. When she spotted me, she immediately called out, "Help me!"

I nearly walked away right then. But she cried harder, her tiny voice breaking as she pleaded, "Please,save me!"

I later learned she was Brandon's half-sister-an unacknowledged presence in the Stark family, born from an affair and largely ignored.
Because I'd been stupid enough to help her down from that tree, she latched onto me like a barnacle. Wherever I went, she followed, until...

I pressed my fingers to my temples, trying to push the memories away.How could it still be so vivid after all these years?

*Stop. Don't go there. Don't fucking go there.*

I opened my eyes suddenly, startled to find wetness on my cheeks.Glancing down, I traced the long scar on the back of my hand,hearing her final words to me as clearly as if she were standing right beside me.

"*Live or die, we shall never meet again.*"
###Chapter 198: Bran's Wife

**Summer's POV**

Manhattan Club was always buzzing with energy, but tonight the place was practically electric. The normally exclusive venue seemed even more packed than usual, with security guards scrutinizing every face at the entrance with extra care.

"What's with all the extra security?" I asked Brandon as we made our way through the lobby. I smoothed down the midnight blue dress I'd chosen for the occasion, suddenly feeling self-conscious. "Are they expecting trouble?"

"No," Brandon replied, his hand resting protectively at the small of my back. "It's because Ethan's here. He rarely makes appearances in New York,so everyone wants to see him."

We were running late-what should have been a quick drive to Manhattan Club had turned into a nightmare when we hit unexpected construction on the bridge. Brandon had remained eerily calm through the whole ordeal,but I could tell he was annoyed by the slight tightening around his eyes.

"Are you sure it's okay that I'm coming?" I asked for what must have been the tenth time. "These are your closest friends. I don't want to intrude on your reunion."

Brandon gave me that look-the one that managed to be both exasperated and indulgent at the same time. "You're my wife," he said simply, as if that explained everything.

And I guess for him, it did.
As we entered the private room, I was immediately struck by the luxury-crystal chandeliers, plush leather seating, and waitstaff who seemed to materialize and vanish like ghosts. The conversation in the room dropped instantly when we walked in, all eyes turning toward us.

"Well, well, well!" Sean's voice cut through the silence. "Look who finally decided to grace us with their presence! Ethan's back in town for the first time in forever, and Brandon, you have the nerve to be late?"

He bounded over, two drinks in hand. "I think this calls for a penalty!Both Brandon and the lovely Mrs. Stark need to drink up!"

The room went pin-drop silent. I felt the weight of every gaze shift to me as Sean's words registered. Mrs. Stark. Not Summer. Not Miss Taylor. Mrs.Stark.

I froze, feeling like a deer caught in headlights. Brandon had mentioned introducing me to his friends, but I'd stupidly assumed they didn't know we were married yet. Clearly, I was wrong.

I forced an awkward smile, accepting the drinks from Sean and handing one to Brandon. My hand was shaking slightly, but I tried to keep my voice steady.

"Sorry we're late," I said, addressing the room. "Traffic was a nightmare.Brandon and I will drink to make up for it!"

I glanced at Brandon, who gave a subtle nod of approval. Taking a deep breath, I downed my drink in one go.

"Come on," Sean protested. "One drink isn't nearly enough for being this late! Right,guys?"
A tall, elegant man I didn't recognize stepped forward. "Absolutely!
Brandon, when exactly did you get married? How is it none of us knew about this? And who is your lovely wife?"

Brandon placed a steadying hand on my waist, but I knew I needed to handle this myself. I straightened my shoulders,summoning my confidence.

"Hi, I'm Summer Taylor," I said with what I hoped was a winning smile."Bran's wife."

Brandon's lips curved into a slight smile as he drank his penalty shot. "We Il take three drinks as punishment," he announced. "But I'll take Summer's other two. She doesn't handle alcohol well."

My heart skipped a beat at his protective gesture. In one simple statement.he'd established both my place in his life and a clear boundary for everyone else. The message was unmistakable: Summer is mine, and I take care of what's mine.

A sharp-eyed man who'd been observing our interaction from the side of the room suddenly spoke up. "Since tonight is Ethan's homecoming. don't you think stealing the spotlight is a bit inappropriate, Brandon? Wouldn't you agree,Mrs. Stark?"

I recognized my cue. This was clearly some kind of power play, and while I didn't fully understand the dynamics at work, I knew I needed to back Brandon up.

"You're absolutely right," I replied smoothly. "We can skip the drinks.Brandon and I will host next time to make it up to everyone."

I patted Brandon's shoulder and took the empty glass from his hand. "Let's sit down,shall we?"
"Fine by me," Brandon agreed, leadling me toward a plush leather couch.

Someone in the crowd let out a low whistle. "Brandon's whipped! Never thought I'd see the day!"

A beautiful woman with striking features laughed. "What did you expect?The rest of you are all single. It's pathetic, really. Brandon's just showing you what you're missing,right Brandon?"

Brandon's eyes narrowed slightly. "Amelia's right. You'llall get used to it eventually."

As we settled into our seats, Brandon immediately reached for the fruit platter, selecting some fresh pieces. "Here, eat something to line your stomach," he said, placing some on a small plate for me.

I couldn't help but smile, tugging gently at his sleeve. "Tone it down a bit,"I whispered. "Everyone's watching."

Inwardly, I was touched by his behavior. It wasn't lost on me what Brandon was doing-clearly establishing my position as his wife in front of his closest friends and associates. This wasn't just about introducing me;it was about making sure everyone understood my importance to him. It was his way of protecting me, of ensuring I would have his social backing if I ever needed it.

I noticed a group of men gathering around Ethan, deep in conversation.Brandon was one of the few who'd stayed behind with me instead of joining them.

"You should go talk to them," I urged, "Don't stay here babysitting me."

Brandon frowned slightly. "You'll be bored alone."
"I won't be," I assured him, nodding toward the beautiful woman who'd spoken up earlier. "That woman over there-Amelia, right? She seems interesting.Who is she?"

"Amelia Lee," Brandon explained, spearing a piece of apple and handing it to me. "Edward's sister. The man next to her is Saul Pena, her fiancé."

I nodded, taking the fruit. "Oh, so she's Edward's sister! That makes sense-they do look alike."

I could see Brandon watching my reaction as I processed this information."Amelia's different from most of the women in this social circle," he added."You'd probably like her. She's genuine."

"Great! Then go join your friends," I encouraged him. "Ethan came all this way to see you guys. I'll introduce myself to Amelia."

Brandon squeezed my hand gently. "If you get bored, just text me. We can leave anytime."

I nodded firmly. "I will. Now go! Everyone's watching us, and you're being embarrassingly clingy."

The truth was, Brandon was being unusually affectionate tonight-far more than I'd ever seen him in public. It was sweet but also slightly mortifying to be the center of so much attention.

As Brandon finally walked away, I breathed in relief and reached for a piece of honeydew melon. I was contemplating how to approach Amelia when she appeared in front of me, holding two glasses of what looked like wine.

She extended one toward me with a confident smile. My mouth was still full of melon, and I stared at her in surprise, caught off guard by her
directness.

Amelia raised an eyebrow, her smile widening. "It's just fruit wine," she assured me. "Barely any alcohol. You're safe."

I swallowed quickly and accepted the glass with a grateful smile. "Hi there.
###Chapter 199: Truth or Dare?

**Summer's POV**

"I'm Amelia Lee," Amnelia said with a warm smile. "I don't think we've met before, so I should introduce myself! I'm Edward's sister-Edward Lee,I mean. You know him, right? He's good friends with Brandon and the others."

"Tm Summer."" I replied, taking her hand and raising my glass in greeting.



"Please, call me Amy," she insisted, waving away the formality. "Amelia sounds so stuffy, doesn't it? Everyone calls me Amy."

I couldn't help but smile at her friendliness. "Okay,Amy it is!"

She clinked her glass against mine. "So, if you don't mind me asking,how did you and Brandon meet? I don't think I've seen you at these gatherings before.'

I hesitated, unsure how much to share. Brandon and I had discussed this earlier-tonight's gathering consisted of his closest circle, people he trusted with our secret.

"Well, Brandon and I have known each other for quite a while," I began carefully. "We've actually been married for some time now. We just haven't had a formal wedding, and not many people know about it. As for how we met..." I smiled at the memory. "That's a long story. Let's just say there were some chance encounters, and Brandon saved me a few times.The people here tonight are pretty much the only ones who know about our marriage,so..."
Amy nodded understandingly. "I get it. Your secret's safe with me.Marriage is your business anyway-as long as you and Brandon truly love each other, nobody else's opinion matters."

"Exactly!" I agreed, relieved by her reaction. "Though this is just temporary. Marriage involves two families eventually, so there might be some complications down the road."

At the card table, Brandon suddenly looked up, his eyes finding mine across the room. He raised his hand, beckoning me over with a subtle gesture that somehow managed to be both commanding and intimate at the same time.

"Brandon," Edward prompted, "it's your turn."

Brandon drew a card from the deck and played it without even looking at it, his eyes still on me. "Come here," he called.

I hesitated, glancing at Amy and the other guests.

Amy grinned, nudging me with her elbow. "Looks like Brandon can't bear to be away from you for even a minute!"

I felt a blush creeping up my cheeks as I made my way over to the table,Amy trailing behind me. She slipped into a spot between Edward and Saul,while I took the empty seat between Brandon and Michael Sullivan.

"So,Ed,how much have you won?" Amy asked Edward, peering at the chips in front of him. Her gaze shifted to Saul's depleted pile. "Yikes, that's rough. Three against one?"

Saul's expression tightened slightly. "Which would you prefer-that I win or your brother wins?"
Amy laughed, the sound light and carefree. "Honestly? Either way is fine with me. It's not my money on the line!"

I turned my attention to Michael Sullivan, seated on my right. His face was a masterclass in controlled neutrality, his eyes calculating behind a polite mask. Everything about him screamed "approach with caution"-from his perfectly tailored suit to his rigid posture. The energy he radiated reminded me of Brandon when we'd first met-cold,intimidating,and deliberately unapproachable.

"Hello," I offered, trying to be friendly.

Michael acknowledged me with a slight nod but didn't speak. Message received.

Brandon's warm hand found mine under the table, his fingers interlacing with mine in a silent claim. I squeezed back, letting him know I was perfectly content where I belonged.

"I heard Brandon's been busy with the Manhattan West Side project," Saul remarked casually, though the look in his eyes was anything but casual.

Before Brandon could respond, Edward laid down his cards with a flourish. "I win," he announced, then turned to Saul with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Sorry about that."

Saul's face darkened. "Edward, you've had incredible luck tonight.Winning every hand-one against three-seems a bit much, don't you think?"

"Winning is just one approach," Edward replied smoothly.′′Ifocus on results, and clearly, I'm one step ahead this time."

"That remains to be seen," Saul shot back. "The Pena family is just as
powerful as the Lee family, wouldn't you agree? And the Manhattan West Side project hasn't even started yet-nothing is set in stone."

Brandon's thumb traced circles on my palm as he nodded. "Saul has a point. Business is like warfare-everything can change in an instant."

Michael, who had been silent until now, suddenly spoke. "There's a type of cooperation called win-win. What do you think, Edward?"

Edward's eyes narrowed. "Sounds like Michael wants a piece of the pie too.



Michael shrugged, his expression revealing nothing. "It's a big cake, and any smart person would want a slice. But I'm not representing the Turner family tonight-I'm ·here for the Sullivan family."

From the second table, Dr. Sean's head snapped up. "Hey, don't drag me into this! I'm just a doctor, not a businessman. The Sullivan family will eventually pass to my cousin anyway. Don't ask me about this stuff."

He cleared his throat, clearly eager to change the subject. "Actually,if you business tycoons wanted to donate some medical resources to Manhattan General,now *that* would be a great idea!"

"Dream on," Michael replied, his tone deadly serious. "The Sullivan family is yours, Sean. I'm just looking after it temporarily. Don't think you can avoid your responsibilities."

Under the table, Brandon's fingers tightened around mine, and I felt him apply slight pressure. I pushed back, our silent game of strength familiar and comforting. As our hands wrestled playfully, I found myself studying the complex dynamics around the table.

"What are you thinking about?" Brandon mnurmured close to my ear.
"I noticed Edward and Saul don't seem to get along," I whispered back. "Aren't they going to be related soon? I thought Saul was Amelia's fiancé."

Brandon nodded slightly. "Edward doesn't approve of Saul, but Amelia is determined to be with him. Edward can't do much about it."

I glanced at Amelia and Saul, noticing the strange tension between them.Despite being engaged, they didn't look at each other the way couples usually did. There was something off about their interaction that I couldn't quite place.

The sound of Dr. Sean's voice broke through my thoughts.

"Alright, this is getting boring," he announced, pushing away from his table. "Since we're celebrating Ethan's return, why don't we play a game instead of just gambling all night?"

"What kind of game?" Amy asked, perking up immediately.

Dr. Sean's eyes gleamed with mischief. "How about Truth or Dare?"
###Chapter 200: You Sleep Your Way, I'll Do It My Way

**Summer's POV**

"Truth or Dare?" Sean's eyes sparkled with mischief as he proposed the game, and I couldn't help but cringe internally.

Amelia voiced my thoughts exactly. "Seriously, Sean? Truth or Dare? That game was played out in like, the eighties! Can't you come up with something a little more... I don't know,this century?"

Sean clutched his chest in mock offense. "What's wrong with Truth or Dare? Some games are classics for a reason! It's not about how new they are-it's about how entertaining they can be." He-turned to Ethan,giving him an exaggerated wink. "Right, Ethan?"

Ethan touched the bridge of his nose thoughtfully, his finger tapping his brow. "Sean has a point. If you want to play,let's play."

And just like that, the decision was made. Nobody was going to argue with the evening's guest of honor.

Sean jumped to his feet, suddenly energized. "Alright, everyone who's playing, gather around!" He spotted James Wilson and Edward's assistant Landon hovering near the door. "Hey! We're gonna need more booze over here! Get the good stuff-put it on Brandon's tab!"

"Okay, here's how we play," Sean announced as bottles arrived. "We spin the bottle. Whoever it points to has to choose-truth or dare. If you refuse both,you drink. Got it?"

"Crystal clear," Amelia replied. "Let's do this!"
Ethan leaned forward, his elegant fingers giving the bottle a precise fick.It spun rapidly, gradually slowing until its neck pointed directly at... me.

"Looks like Mrs. Stark is our lucky winner!" Sean crowed. "Ethan, hit her with a question everyone's dying to know!"

Brandon's hand found mine, his grip reassuring. "It's just a game," he murmured. "If you don't want to answer, I'll drink for you."

"Tm not nervous," I whispered back. "Just...awkward!"

Ethan studied me, then turned to Sean. "Whydon't you ask the question,Sean?"

Sean's grin turned devilish. "Summer, when and where was your first time with Brandon, and how long did it last?"

The room went silent. I felt my face turn approximately the shade of a fire truck.

"I'Il... uh... I'll drink," I stammered, reaching for the glass. Brandon's hand caught mine.

"Hamptons estate," Brandon stated. "As for how long, Sean, think about how long I could beat you up continuously, and you'll have your answer."

The room exploded with laughter.

"That doesn't count!" Sean protested. "Summer was supposed to answer.not you! Besides, how do we know you're not just bragging?"

Brandon calmly removed his jacket and handed it to me, then stood up."Would you like me to demonstrate? Stand up."

Sean's face paled. "Hey, we're playing a game here! No need to get violent!"
He grabbed his glass. "Fine, I beleve you! I'll drink for Ethan!"

Ethan leaned back. "Actually, I'm curious to see if Sean's improved his fighting skills."

"So am I" Brandon agreed, still standing.

"No, no, no!" Sean gulped down his drink. "I'm drinking, see? Whose turn is it now? Summer?"

With newfound confidence, I reached for the bottle and spun it. The universe must have been on-my side because it landed directly on Sean.

"Karma's a bitch, isn't it?" Edward commented dryly.

"Truth or dare, Sean?" I asked, feeling Brandon's amused gaze on me.

Sean looked between us, clearly trying to gauge which option would be less painful. "There's no way I'm picking truth. I choose dare!"

"Perfect," I replied sweetly. "I dare you to French kiss someone in this room-and it can't be me or Brandon."

Sean's jaw dropped. "What the actual-" He looked around at the expectant faces. "Are you serious?"

"Totally serious," I confirmed. "You chose dare! Time to pucker up, Doctor!



Sean's eyes dartedI around desperately. "Can I just... die instead?"

"Nope," I said cheerfully. "You suggested this game,remember? You can't back out now. What would everyone in Manhattan say?"
"Summer," Sean pleaded, "I was wrong, okay? I was so wrong. Can I do
something else? I'll sing for you! I'll call you 'Your Majesty' for the rest of the night! Anything!"

I pretended to consider his offer. "Alright, I'll be merciful. You don't have to kiss anyone but you do have to finish that bottle of whiskey."

Sean looked at the nearly full bottle. "You're vicious, you know that? Even worse than Brandon. At least he's upfront about it."

With a resigned sigh, Sean grabbed the whiskey and began to drink,his face contorted in dramatic martyrdom.

"Will this do?" I asked Brandon quietly.

"He'll be fine," Brandon assured me. "His alcohol tolerance is legendary."

The game continued for several more rounds, with Sean becoming the night's biggest loser. Somehow, every time I spun the bottle, it landed on Sean. After the fifth time, I started to wonder if the bottle was rigged.

By the time we called it a night, Sean was significantly tipsy but still standing. Amelia wasn't far behind, having taken a few dares that involved drinking.

"We should head out," Brandon announced, his arm protectively around my waist.

"Already?" Sean protested, "The night is young!"

"It's almost two in the morning," Brandon pointed out.

Outside the club, Manhattan's lights sparkled against the night sky. The crisp air cleared my head a bit as Brandon guided me toward the waiting car,James following with our belongings.
Back at the Hamptons estate, I helped Brandon to our bedroom, though he insisted he was perfectly fine. It was endearing to see him slightly less composed than usual-not drunk, just more relaxed,his guard lowered just a fraction.

"Let me help you." I said as I began to unbutton his shirt. He watched me with those intense eyes, saying nothing as I carefully removed his clothes."You should take a shower."

After getting him into the bathroom, I laid out fresh clothes and turned down the bed. When he emerged, hair damp and skin flushed from the hot water, he looked much more like himself-except for that glint in his eyes that I recognized all too well.
"Brandon," I protested, pushing his hand away when he slid in beside me."I said I'm tired!"

"I heard you," he replied, his lips finding my neck. "You sleep. I'll entertain myself."

I groaned, rolling away from him. "No, I mean it! I'm exhausted. Just lie down and go to sleep!"
Brandon's chuckle was warm against my skin as he pulled me back against his chest. "You sleep your way, I'll do it my way."
I sighed, too tired to argue further. As his hands began to wander again,I knew sleep would have to wait just a little longer.
###Chapter 201: Drunk on You

Summer's POV
The Hamptons estate was a warm blur as I leaned into Brandon’s chest. His arms curled around me in a lazy, protective grip that brought a sense of familiar safety. The whiskey I’d shared with him earlier softened the edges of the world, making every brush of his fingers feel like a gentle spark in the quiet night. I’d mumbled something about being tired, but the words dissolved as his breath fanned against my ear, a warm presence that centered me.
His palms grazed my ribs—a silent, tender question that I answered by tilting my head back against his shoulder. The room tilted in a sweet, tipsy haze as he turned me toward him. His mouth found mine in a kiss that was sudden and overwhelming, filled with a deep, unvoiced longing. I melted into his embrace, my fingers twisting in his hair as the rest of the world ceased to exist.
He lowered me onto the bed with careful precision. In the dim light, his eyes were dark with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat—a raw, deep affection that felt both powerful and grounding. The air between us was thick with a tension that had been building all evening, but now it was softening into something more profound.
The night became a beautiful blur of connection. Every touch was a silent promise, every breath shared an admission of total trust. In the heat of our proximity, I lost myself in a gentle rhythm that spoke of a bond deeper than words. His presence was everywhere, guiding me into a sanctuary of peace and belonging that I never wanted to leave.
The alcohol kept me relaxed, and though my thoughts were hazy, the feeling of being cherished and wanted was clearer than ever. As we moved together in the quiet sanctuary of our room, the chaos of our lives seemed miles away. We eventually drifted into a deep, peaceful sleep, held fast in each other's arms under the quiet moonlight, finally at rest.
###Chapter 202: Who Wants to Meet Her

Brandon's POV
Sunlight streamed through the partially opened curtains as I reviewed quarterly reports on my laptop. June was still asleep on the far side of the bed, curled up in a nest of blankets, looking more peaceful than I’d seen her in weeks. I closed my computer, setting it aside to watch her for a moment, enjoying the rare stillness of the afternoon.
She finally stirred, stretching before sitting up groggily. Her eyes widened as they landed on the digital clock on the bedside table.
"One o'clock?" Her voice rose in a frantic squeak. "Why didn't you wake me? I’ve slept half the day away!"
I shrugged, leaning over to offer her a glass of water. "You were exhausted. You needed the rest more than the morning hours."
June took a sip, but as she moved to pull back the covers, she suddenly froze. She caught a glimpse of herself in the vanity mirror across the room—her hair was a mess, and the faint, rosy color on her neck and shoulders told the story of how late we’d stayed up talking and... everything else.
"Oh my god," she groaned, hiding her face in her hands. "Summer, you idiot. When will you ever learn to keep track of time?"
I slipped out of the room with a quiet chuckle while she continued her self-admonishment, heading downstairs to my makeshift office in the living room. I heard the soft patter of her footsteps on the stairs minutes later.
June stood at the landing, wearing one of my white button-downs that hung down to her mid-thighs. Her eyes held a hint of a playful accusation, and she was gripping the banister as if her balance hadn't quite returned to her yet.
"Finally up for real?" I asked, setting aside my work.
She didn't answer immediately, but the way she leaned against the railing spoke volumes about her lingering fatigue. I smiled and beckoned to her. "Come here."
"No," she declared, crossing her arms over the oversized shirt. "And tonight, you're banished. You're sleeping in the guest room."
I raised an eyebrow, leaning back in my chair. "Oh? What exactly did I do to deserve exile?"
"I’m not discussing it. You're just not allowed in our bedroom tonight. I need actual sleep!"
I leaned back, a teasing glint in my eyes. "So the bedroom is off-limits? Does that mean the study is fair game? The kitchen? Or maybe right here in the living room? The balcony has a nice view, too."
June's cheeks turned a deep, vibrant red. "You—you’re shameless! How can you say that with a straight face?"
"How am I shameless? We're married, June. This is normal conversation between a husband and wife. Are you actually embarrassed?"
"I never realized you were this relentless!" she sputtered, though she couldn't quite hide the small smile tugging at her lips.
I crossed the room, taking her hands in mine. They were ice cold. "Your hands are freezing," I noted, rubbing them between my palms to generate heat. "It's winter—you need to keep warm, even when you're indoors."
June didn't pull away; instead, she burrowed her fingers deeper into my hands. "That's better."
I reached out and lightly traced the tip of her nose. "Hungry?"
She nodded vigorously. "Starving. I feel like I haven't eaten in years."
"I made congee earlier," I told her. "You barely touched your dinner at the Manhattan Club last night. I'll go heat it up for you."
June caught my arm as I started to move. "No, I can get it myself. You should get back to your reports. I know how busy the Stark Group is right now."
"It can wait," I assured her, leading her toward the kitchen. "Nothing's more important than making sure you're taken care of. Besides, I haven't eaten either."
Her eyes widened. "You haven't eaten? But it's so late! Brandon, next time if I’m not up, just eat without me. You’ll get a stomach ache."
"I preferred to wait for you," I said simply.
In the dining room, June's eyes lit up at the spread—not just the steaming congee, but several small, animal-shaped bread rolls arranged on a wooden board.
"Brandon, did you make all this?" she asked, picking up a roll that vaguely resembled a bear.
"No," I said flatly, keeping my expression neutral.
She bit into it and grinned. "Don't lie. If these were store-bought, they wouldn't look this... unique."
"Unique?" I repeated, an eyebrow raised.
"No, no!" she backpedaled, laughing. "They're charming! They look way better than those perfect, factory-made ones. These have character!"
"Just eat," I said, amused by her transparent attempt to soothe my culinary ego.
"Mmm!" she hummed after taking a bite. "This is actually incredible. Thank you, Brandon."
"One home-cooked meal and I've successfully bought your forgiveness," I teased as she reached for a second roll.
June barely slowed down, clearly making up for the missed breakfast. Once she finally finished, she looked much more like herself.
"Hey, do you have to go into the office today?" she asked.
"Probably not. Did you want to go somewhere?"
She shook her head quickly. "No way. I'm staying right here. I'm far too tired for the outside world."
"Full?" I asked as she set her spoon down.
June nodded. "Very."
I stood and gathered the bowls. "You should take a short walk in the garden. The fresh air will help your digestion."
"Let me help you with the dishes first," she offered.
"Go for your walk. I'll join you in a few minutes."
"If you insist." June smiled softly, her eyes warm. "Brandon, you're so good to me."
I tapped her forehead lightly. "Go on."
As I rinsed the dishes, I glanced out the window to see June strolling through the garden. Despite the winter chill, the sun cast her in a golden glow as she meandered between the dormant flower beds. She turned back toward the house and waved enthusiastically.
"Brandon! The sun's actually warm! Come outside!"
"I'll be right there!" I called back. "Just need to take a quick call!"
My phone vibrated in my pocket. It was Ethan Kennedy.
"Ethan," I answered, leaning against the counter.
"Got a minute?" His voice was characteristically calm, but there was an underlying seriousness.
"Yes. What is it?"
"I've brought someone with me who wants to see Meave."
I frowned, immediately concerned. My uncle Gavin's wife, Meave, had been in poor health for years, and Gavin had become increasingly protective. "She hasn't been well lately. Gavin hasn't let her receive visitors in ages unless it's absolutely necessary. I don't think he'll agree to a random meeting."
"It is necessary," Ethan replied firmly. "I wouldn't ask if it weren't."
"Who is this person?"
"Don't worry," Ethan assured me. "They won't upset her. In fact, I think Meave would be very happy to see her."
Her. That piqued my interest. "All right. I'll speak to Meave first and see how she’s feeling today."
As I ended the call, I noticed June standing in the doorway, a look of concern on her face. "What's wrong? Is it trouble at the company?"
"No, nothing like that. It's Ethan."
"Is he okay? He seemed fine at the club last night."
"He's fine. He just has a request that involves my aunt." I noticed her shifting slightly, looking a bit pale. "Feeling okay? You're not getting a stomach ache, are you?"
"How did you know?" she sighed.
"I could tell. You ate too much too quickly. You need to be more careful. No more binge eating just because you're hungry."
"Yes, yes, doctor," she joked. "But it's your fault for being such a good cook. Now, don't change the subject—who does Ethan want to see? Is it someone important?"
"It sounds like it," I said, already dialing my aunt's private line.
"Aunt Meave, it's Brandon."
"Brandon?" Her voice sounded thin but surprised. "Is everything all right?"
"I’m fine. I was just calling to check on you. It's been a while since we've caught up."
"I have all the time in the world these days, confined to this house," she replied with a dry wit. "But what is this call really about? You usually have a reason."
"I'd like to bring someone over," I said, glancing at June. "There's someone I think you should meet."
"Someone I should meet? Well, that sounds intriguing. It must be someone quite special."
"They are," I confirmed.
"Well, I've been cooped up far too long anyway," Meave said, her voice sounding a bit more spirited. "When were you thinking?"
"Today, if possible. I'll send a car for you, and we can all have dinner together here."
###Chapter 203: First Impression

**Summer's POV**

I was enjoying the warm winter afternoon on the garden swing when Max's frantic barking shattered the tranquility. His deep, territorial woofs echoed from the front of the house, growing more insistent by the second.

"Max!" I called out, hurrying across the lawn. "What's going on, buddy?"

As I rounded thecorner, I saw James's car pulling up the driveway. Max was in full guard-dog mode, his fur standing on end as he barked at the unfamiliar visitors stepping out.

"Max. quiet!" I commanded, grabbing his collar. "Those are guests,not intruders! No more barking!"

Max whined but settled down as I watched James help an elegant older woman from the car. A distinguished-looking man followed, while Desmond struggled with several pieces of luggage in the background.

The woman stopped abruptly when she saw me, her eyes widening. Her lips parted, and I could have sworn she whispered something before the man beside her squeezed her hand, giving her a warning look.

"Hello there!" I called out with my brightest smile. "You must be Brandon's uncle and aunt! I'm Summer, Brandon's wife. It's so nice to finally mneet you!"

They exchanged surprised glances before looking at James,who nodded in confirmation.

"Mr. and Mrs. Stark, this is indeed Brandon's wife, Summer Taylor," James explained formally.
"Oh!" I realized why they looked so shocked. "Brandon probably didn't mention we were married, did he? I'm sorry about that. Please, come in!Brandont's in his study upstairs. I'll go get him right away."

I gave Max a final warning pat before hurrying inside and up the stairs to Brandon's study.


Brandon was at his desk, surrounded by stacks of papers. When I entered,he set down his pen and rubbed his temples,looking exhausted.

"Your uncle and aunt are here," I said softly, moving behind him to massage his tight shoulders. "How's that? Better?"

Brandon leaned into my touch. "Much better," he murmured.

"Good." I pressed a kiss to the top of his head. "Then let's go downstairs.Your family is waiting."

"Did you meet them already?" Brandon asked, catching my hand.

"Just briefly in the garden," I explaned. "Though I think I might have startled them-they looked pretty shocked when I introduced myself as your wife."

"It's fine," he assured me. "They would have found out sooner or later.Gavin and Meave are the most open-minded people in the Stark family. I practically grew up with them-they're very important to me."

"I understand," I nodded. "I think I made an okay first impression?"

Brandon's expression softened into a rare, genuine smile. "I have complete faith in you," he said, rising from his chair. "Let's go."

He took my hand as we headed downstairs. When we entered the living
room. Gavin and Meave were seated on the sofa, speaking in hushed tones that immediately ceased when they spotted us.

"Uncle Gavin, Aunt Meave!" Brandon's voice carried unusual warmth."It's been too long."

Meave's eyes darted to5 our joined hands, a mixture of relief and curiosity replacing her earlier tension.

"Too long indeed." she agreed, her tone lightly scolding. "Long enough for you to get married without telling any of us! Since when did you grow up enough to make such decisions without consulting family?"

Brandon's fingers tightened around mine. "I'm telling you now, aren't I? I promise you and Uncle Gavin are the first to know about our marriage."

"And what about your parents?" Meave pressed.

Brandon remained silent, which was answer enough.

Meave sighed dramatically. "You didn't even mention your marriage on the phone! Gavin and I came completely unprepared. This is our first time meeting..."

"It's Summer, Mrs. Stark," I jumped in quickly. "Brandon has been wanting to introduce us for a while now, but I kept putting it off because the timing never seemed right."

Brandon squeezed my hand. "Aunt Meave, you must be tired from standing. Let me help you sit down."

"T'll make some tea," I offered, heading to the kitchen. I returned minutes later with a carefully prepared tray. "Mr. Stark, I've made your tea the way Brandon takes his. Mrs. Stark, I prepared chamomile for you-it's milder
and should be soothing."

Meave's expression softened as she accepted the cup. "How thoughtful!Brandon, she's not only beautiful but considerate too!"

I felt my cheeks warm. "You're too kind, Mrs.Stark."

"This estate," Gavin spoke up suddenly. "Did you redecorate it?"

I blinked in surprise at his perceptiveness. "You noticed? I didIn't change much, honestly. Brandon's original decor was already beautiful. I just switched out the plain white curtains for these warmer cream-toned ones and added a few abstract art pieces. Nothing major."

Gavin nodded slowly. "You understand him well."

"Not really," I demurred. "We haven't known each other that long,which is partly why we kept our marriage quiet at first. I hope you don't hold that against us, Mr.Stark?"

"Marriage concerns not just two individuals but two families," Gavin stated,his tone serious but not unkind. "While Meave and I have no right to express disapproval, traditionally, families should be informed."

I nodded. "You're absolutely right. That was an oversight on our part. But inviting you here today is our first step toward properly including family.My own family situation is... complicated. I'd rather not involve them in our marriage right now. My grandfathers, George and Jonathan, do know about us though, and they both think very highly of Brandon."

"Really?" Gavin's eyebrows raised slightly.

"Yes, Uncle," Brandon confirmed.
Gavin studied us both. "I see. I know you're careful in your decisions,Brandon. If you chose not to tell us earlier, you must have had your reasons. However, regarding your parents and grandfather William..."

"When the time is right, I'll tell them," Brandon replied firmly. "For now,I'd appreciate your discretion."

"It's your business," Gavin acknowledged. "Though you should inform your father soon. Your mother's situation is more... delicate, especially with Elle Sinclair in the picture. How do you plan to handle that?"

I felt Brandon tense slightly beside me at the mention of Elle Sinclair.

"That situation is under control," Brandon replied, his tone brooking no argument. "Since you're here, why not stay for a couple of days? The air is fresh. and you won't be bothered by any unwelcome interruptions."

Gavin's expression shifted to something almost like approval. "You little rascal," he said, rising from his seat. "Brandon, come upstairs with me.I need to discuss something with you privately."

As the two men left the room, I found myself alone with Meave Stark, who was still watching me with that peculiar look in her eyes-as if she were seeing a ghost instead of me.
###Chapter 204:Arya Carter

**Summer's POV**

Then Meave asked me a few questions about me and my family which I answered without hesitation.

"Brandon is a good boy," she said suddenly, her voice warm with affection."I've watched him grow up, you know. He's always been...particular about the people he lets into his life."

I smiled, feeling a flutter of pride. "He is pretty selective."

"And you," she continued, her gaze softening, "you're a good match for him.I can see why he chose you."
"Thank you," I replied, genuinely touched by her approval. "That means a lot. especially coming from someone so important to him."
Meave adjusted the throw blanket across her lap, her movements careful and measured. "You know, dear, this marriage of yours can't stay a secret forever.You'll need to find the right time to tell the rest of the family."

I nodded, sinking back into the plush armchair across from her. "We know.It's just... the timing doesn't feel right yet. We're not avoiding it forever,I promise."

"Good," Meave said with a satisfied nod. "That's all I needed to hear."

She studied me for another moment, her head tilted slightly. "You know,you're quite the interesting one. Not particularly calculating,but remarkably perceptive."
I felt my cheeks warm at her assessment. "You're giving me too much
credit, Mrs. Stark."

"Meave, please," she corrected gently.

She folded her hands neatly in her lap. "So you work at Stark Group?What about that Sinclair girl... Elle, isn't it?"

I tensed slightly at the mention of Elle butquickly recovered. "At work,Brandon and I keep things strictly professional. I'm in Projects, so we don't cross paths that often anyway. Work is work, personal life is separate."

"A wise approach." Meave nodded.

I took a deep breath, deciding to broach the subject Brandon had prepared me for. "Actually, Brandon didn't just invite you here to meet me. He wants you to meet someone else."

"Not you?" Meave's eyebrows shot up in surprise.

"No," I clarified. "Someone Brandon says is important to you."

Her expression shifted to wary curiosity. "Who?"

"I don't have all the details," I admitted, lowering my voice. "But Brandon thought it was important, and he wanted to do this without Gavin knowing first."

"Keep something from Gavin?" She looked stunned.

I nodded apologetically. "I know it's a lot to ask. Brandon said it's completely your choice. If you'd rather not..."

She fell silent, her fingers methodically smoothing her skirt.Finally,she looked up with determination in her eyes.
"Brandon's like a son to me," she said. "If he thinks this is important enough to arrange, I trust his judgment." A mischievous smile played at her lips. "And I know how to handle Gavin."
Without hesitation, she pulled out her phone and dialed.

"Gavin," she said sweetly when he answered, "I'm craving that chocolate mousse cake from Le Pâtissier. Would you mind getting me one?"
A pause. "Yes, now," she confirmed. "Thank you, darling."

She hung up with a satisfied smile. "That should keep him busy for a while."

As Meave put away her phone, Brandon and Gavin entered the living room. Their expressions were serious, and I wondered what they'd been discussing upstairs. Brandon's eyes met mine briefly,a silent reassurance passing between us.

After Gavin left, the atmosphere shifted. Meave turned to Brandon with a serious expression.

"I know you're always thoughtful about these things," she said. "Whatever you have planned, I trust you."

Brandon nodded, then fetched a soft cashmere blanket and carefully draped it over Meave's lap.

"It's Ethan Kennedy," he said quietly. "Remember him?"

"Ethan?" Meave's hand flew to her throat. "The Carter family's adopted son?"

Brandon nodded.
"Ethan..." Meave's gaze drifted. lost in memory. "He's been abroad, hasn't he? I've seen him so rarely since marrying into the Stark family."

She shook her head. "I can barely picture him now."

"He's in New York," Brandon said. "And he asked to see you."

"Did he?" Meave whispered, wonder in her voice. "I'll see hím then. I remember when I first met him-just a tiny thing. And now..." She smiled at Brandon. "About your age?"

"Three years older," Brandon corrected.

"Of course." Meave nodded. "Time slips away from me these days."

Brandon took her hand. "He'll be here soon. I wanted to arrange this without Gavin because, as you know, Gavin and the Carter family..."

"I understand," Meave assured him. "You're right to be cautious. I'll see Ethan first, then decide how to tell Gavin."

Just then, the doorbell chimed.

"I'll get it!" I jumped up. "Probably Ethan."

I hurried to the door, quickly smoothing my hair before opening it. Ethan Kennedy stood there, looking even more elegant than at Manhattan Club,a light brown coat draped over his arm. Beside him-

My breath caught. Standing next to him was a girl with a doll-like face,dressed in a pale pink dress that made her look like a porcelain figurine.
"Ethan!" I managed.

He acknowledged me with a slight nod. "Summer. Where's Brandon?"
"Inside with Meave," I replied, my eyes drifting to the girl. "Ethan, who is...?”

"Arya." Ethan commanded without looking at her, "say hello."

"Mrs. Stark," the girl said sweetly.

I smiled automatically. "Hi, I'm Summer. Please, come in."

I led them through the foyer, offering slippers. "This way, Ethan. Arya.you too."

After showing them in, I stepped into the kitchen to prepare coffee,watching from the doorway as Ethan approached Meave.

"Aunt Meave." he said, his voice gentler than I'd ever heard it.

Meave stared at him, visibly stunned, her eyes traveling over his tall frame and perfect features-so different from the boy she must have known.
"Ethan?" she asked. "Is it really you?"

"Come closer," she urged, extending a trembling hand. "Let me look at you.It's been so many years... I can hardly believe how you've grown."
Ethan knelt beside the sofa, taking her hand. "Aunt Meave, it's me. How are you? Is your health holding up?"

"Well enough," she replied dismissively. "But you-how many years has it been? I could hardly believe Brandon when he said you wanted to see me.How have yo been abroad all this time?"
"Well, thanks to your kindness," Ethan replied formally. "And you've been well?"
"Well enough." Meave repeated. "I never thought I'd see you again. You came to New York specially? Why not visit Philadelphia too?"

Her gaze shifted to the girl standing behind Ethan. "And who is this? She looks so familiar..."

Her expression turned knowing. "Your girlfriend, Ethan?"

Ethan shook his head. "Look closer."

"Arya," he commanded. "gocloser. Let Aunt Meave see you properly."

Arya's brow furrowed slightly, reluctance crossing her doll-like features.She moved forward hesitantly, stopping in frontof Meave.

Meave leaned forward, squinting. Then her eyes flew wide,one hand rising to her mouth. "Ethan, is she... is this Arya? *That* Arya?"
###Chapter 205: Who Are You

**Ethan's POV**

"Yes, Aunt Meave!" I confirmed, my tone gentle but firm. "It's her."

Meave's face went pale, her fingers trembling. "How can you be so certain?After all these years..."

I understood her skepticism. When Arya disappeared, she'd been barely five years old. The Carter family had exhausted every resource trying to find her-all had led nowhere, until now.

"I can hardly believe it myself," I admitted. "When I first saw her,I couldn't believe two people could look so identical." I glanced at Arya, standing stiffly beside me. "But I needed to be sure before bringing her to the Carter family. That's why I brought her to you first."
I moved closer to Meave. "You used to hold Arya when she was little. She had a birthmark on her arm-do you remember?"
Meave's eyes lit with recognition. "Yes, I remember." Her voice strengthened. "It was so distinctive-impossible to miss or forget, even if I wanted to."

With a gentle motion, I turned to Arya. "Show Aunt Meave your arm,please."

Arya hesitated before slowly rolling up her sleeve. Her thin arm bore multiple scars, already healed into permanent marks. But there, amid the remnants of old wounds, was the heart-shaped birthmark exactly where it should be.

Meave gasped, her hands flying to her mouth. The scars seemed to horrify
her more than the birthmark confirmed her identity. Her eyes welled with tears.

"Yes." she whispered, "Arya had exactly this birthmark. It was smaller when she was a child, but... is it really you? Areyou really Arya?"

Arya pulled her arm back, rolling down her sleeve. "I don't know," she replied flatly. She glanced at me. "MMy name is Nine. Ethan found me and told me I might be part of the Carter family."

Meave looked at me, her eyes shining with questions. "Ethan, how did you find her? After all these years..."

"A fortunate coincidence," I replied simply.

Summer emerged from the kitchen carrying two cups of coffee."Why don't we al sit down?" she suggested, placing the cups on the coffee table.
She exchanged a look with Brandon. "Brandon, I think I'd like some fresh air. Would you mind walking with me?"

Brandon's eyes narrowed slightly before he nodded. "Fine."

As he stood, Brandon addressed the room with quiet authority. "Aunt Meave and Ethan, take your time to catch up. Summer and I will step out for a while."

Once they'd left, Meave beckoned Arya to sit beside her. "Don't be nervous,"she said gently. "I promise I don't bite."

Arya bristled. "I'm not nervous!" she insisted, before adding with a forced smile, "I'm just not used to... this."

"We searched for her for years," I explained to Meave. "I've been abroad
for business these past few years, and I found her completely by chance."I leaned forward. "As it turns out, she was adopted by a Mexican-American couple who took her to Mexico. That's why we never found any trace of her in the U.S."

I reached into my jacket pocket and pulled out a folder, handing it to Meave. "I was worried I might be wrong, so I investigated thoroughly.Arya was kidnapped when she was very young-too young to remember clearly.She passed through several places before ending up in a foster care facility where this couple eventually adopted her."
Meave's hands trembled as she opened the folder. With a sudden movement, she reached for Arya's arm again, gently pushing up the sleeve to reveal the scars. Tears spilled freely down her cheeks.

"Oh, my poor child," she whispered. "What did they do to you?"

Arya pulled her arm away awkwardly. "It's nothing. That was a long time ago-I barely remember it now. After I went to Mexico, things were good.My adoptive parents treated me well."

"Really?" Meave asked,doubt clear in her voice.

"Really!" Arya insisted with a firm nod. "If Ethan hadn't found me,I probably wouldn't have come back at all."

A heavy silence fell before Arya spoke again, her voice suddenly hard. "I didn't come back to stay permanently. I just want to see my birth parents,and then I'll leave. I won't disrupt their lives."

Meave shook her head vigorously. "That's out of the question! You're a Carter-now that Ethan has found you, you1 must return to your family where you belong."
She turned to me, confusion clouding her features. "But why come to me first?" Her expression grew troubled. "Ethan, you know the situation. After I chose to marry Gavin Stark, things... well, the Carter family and I haven't exactly been on speaking terms for years."

I met her gaze directly. "I understand your concern, Aunt Meave. I'm not here to cause trouble. I just want Arya to take a DNA test with you."I gestured to the folder. "Even with her resemblance to her mother, even with the birthmark-we need concrete proof. Without a DNA test, none of this holds up legally."

I lowered my voice. "The situation within the Carter family is...complicated right now. It's better not to get involved unless we're absolutely certain."

Meave nodded slowly. "So you want me to do a DNA test with Arya because I'm her aunt, and our DNA would match if she's truly a Carter. If she's not, you won't bring her into the family at all?"
"That's correct," I confirmed.

"I don't object to the test. If Arya truly is a Carter, she should return to her rightful family, no matter how complicated things might be." Meave said.

I felt a surge of appreciation. "That's what I believe too. Though I'm not a Carter by blood, I was raised in the family. I owe them my loyalty."

"You've done so much already," Meave said gratefully. She turned to Arya,taking the girl's hand. "My dear, you look so much like your mother, it's almost uncanny." She paused, seeming about to say more, but stopped herself. "Well, never mind. When would you like to do the DNA test?"
"There's no rush," I replied, "I'm staying in New York for a while on
business. You're not well, Aunt Meave-we should wait until you've had some time to rest."

Her eyes brightened. "You're not leaving soon?"

"No." I assured her.

"That's wonderful!" She smiled. "I'll be staying here at Brandon's place for a while. You should visit often."

She turned to Arya. "Brandon's wife, Summer, is a lovely girl. You should get to know her better, Arya."
Arya pulled her hand away, her expression carefully neutral. "Yes, Aunt Meave," she replied, the words polite but her tone distant.
I noticed how stiffly Arya sat, clearly uncomfortable despite her attempts to hide it. Meave saw it too-I could see the flash of sorrow in her eyes.
The sound of the front door opening cut through the tension. Gavin Stark entered, carrying an elegant pastry box, his expression shifting instantly as his eyes landed on me. His brow furrowed deeply, his entire demeanor hardening.

His gaze darted to Meave, noting her tearstained face, and his anger seemed to intensify tenfold. With measured steps, he approached us,towering over me where I sat.

"Who are you people?" he demanded, his voice cold as ice.
###Chapter 206: Using Her Kindness

**Ethan's POV**

"Who are you people?" Gavin Stark's cold voice cut through the room like a blade.

I remained seated, refusing to be intimidated by his imposing presence.The way he looked down at me was meant to make me feel small. It ddn't work.

"Hello. Mr. Stark," I said calmly, extending my hand. "I'm Ethan Kennedy.



His eyes flickered with recognition, but he deliberately ignored my outstretched hand. The slight didn't bother me; I'd expected nothing ess.
Gavin turned to Meave, his face tight with barely controlled anger. "You said you wanted chocolate mousse cake. That was a lie, wasn't it? Just to get me out of the house so you could meet with someone from the Carter family?"

Meave's eyes widened, her hand reaching for his. "Gavin, please, you're misunderstanding. Ethán just came to see me. This has nothing to do with the Carter family. Ethan left them years ago. He's just here to check on me,that's all."


Gavin pulled his hand away. "So Brandon knew about this too? Was I the only one kept in the dark?"

"Gavin, please don't be angry," Meave pleaded. "I haven't done anything wrong. Ethan simply wanted to see me."
"Gavin," Meave added, her voice growing firmer,""aguest is a guest.
Especially since Ethan is Brandon's friend!"

Gavin's eyes darted to me, then to Arya, who had shrunk back."And who is she?" he demanded.

Meave straightened her shoulders, gesturing to Arya. "Arya, come meet your Uncle Gavin!"

Arya stepped forward hesitantly. "Hello, Uncle," she greeted him softly.

I suppressed a smile. She was playing her part beautifully-the innocent lost lamb. Few would suspect the steel beneath that fragile exterior.
Gavin glanced between us, still suspicious. "Where are Brandon and his wife?"

"The lovebirds went for a walk," Meave replied, her tone lightening. "Young couples need their privacy."
As if on cue,Summer walked in with Brandon trailing behind. She paused when she spotted our tense tableau.
"Mrs. Stark," Arya greeted her formally.

Summer's face broke into an easy smile. "Please, don't be so formal. Just call me Summer or whatever you're comfortable with."

She approached Arya warmly. "How old are you, Arya?"

"Twenty-three," Arya replied, some of the stiffness leaving her shoulders.

Summer grinned. "I'm only two years older than you. You can call me 'sis'if you want."
Arya's lips curved into a small smile.
"Let me make some tea for everyone," Summer offered, heading toward the kitchen with Meave following.
Minutes later, they emerged with a tea service arranged on a silver tray.

"Summer, impressive," Meave commented. "Did you study it?"

Summer set the tray down carefully. "I learned from my grandfather when I was young."

She poured tea with practiced movements.

Gavin accepted his cup with a nod. "Thank you. Brandon has found himself a good wife."
"It's getting late," Summer said, glancing at her watch. "Why don't you all both for dinner? I'll start preparing now."
Without waiting for a response, she headed to the kitchen with Brandon following.
Gavin watched them go, his expression softening. "That boy seems to have finally figured things out."
"Indeed. He has developed something of a... human touch."

Gavin's hand stílled over the board. His eyes met mine in quiet agreement."Yes, that's exactly it. The human touch."
By the time Summer called us to dinner, Gavin and I had reached an unspoken truce. The dining table was laden with dishes that filled the room with aroma.

"Everyone, dinner's ready!" Summer announced.
Meave inhaled appreciatively. "It smells delicious, Summer! I had no idea you could cook like this."

Summer laughed,shaking her head. "Oh, it was mostly Brandon. I just helped out."

The six of us settled around the table, the earlier tension completely dissolved. I caught Gavin watching Brandon and Summer with approval,exchanging knowing glances with Meave. The Stark elders had clearly given their blessing to this union.




After dinner, I made our excuses, helping Arya with her coat. Once inside the car, with the doors closed against the cold night air, she turned to me,all pretense gone.

"Is that why you brought me here? Just to see her?" she demanded, her voice sharp.

I didn't answer, focusing on starting the car and pulling away from the Hamptons estate.

"She's a good woman,"' Arya continued. "I can see how much you respect her. Yet you're using her kindness. Don't you think that's cruel?"
I pulled the car over, turning to face her fully. With one finger, I liftedher chin,forcing her to meet my gaze.
"Nine," I said quietly, using the name she'd gone by when I first found her."Do you remember our first meeting?"
Her entire body trembled, her eyes widening with fear. "I've forgotten," she whispered.
"How could you forget something like that?" I pressed,my voice soft but relentless. "People are most honest about what they truly want when they're at their lowest point. Like when I found you. You were willing to do anything to survive. Nothing was off-limits as long as it achieved your goal.1


She pulled away from my touch. "That was wrong-sinful. That's why I met you in the first place." Her eyes flashed. "If I could choose again, I would never have crossed paths with you."

I traced a finger down her cheek, watching her flinch. "People are willing to sacrifice much to get what they want. There's nothing wrong with that."
"Nine, once you get what you want, if you do good afterward-if you become a better person-God will forgive you. Are.you afraid?"
She remained silent, but I could see the conflict in her eyes.

"Think about what drives you forward,and you won't be afraid anymore."
I said. "We're in New York now, wouldn't you like to see your old friends?Or perhaps visit the place where we first met?"

Her gaze hardened. "No, thank you. I'm tired. I want to rest."

"Very well," I agreed, putting the car back in drive.

As we continued in silence, I watched her from the corner of my eye. She had closed her eyes, but I knew she wasn't sleeping. Her mind was racing with memories-the path that had led her to me, the choices she'd made.

She turned her head away, trying to escape my presence, my influence.
###Chapter 207: She's Jealous

**Summer's POV**

The January air bit at my cheeks as I hurried into Stark Tower, clutching the Manhattan West Side project reports to my chest. Leo had been obsessing over these revisions for days, and I'd stayed up until 2 AM finalizing them.

"Hold it, please!" I called, spotting the elevator doors beginning to close. A hand shot out to stop them, and I slipped inside with a grateful smile that quickly morphed into surprise.

"Monica?" I asked, taking in her disheveled appearance. Monica was always the picture of professional perfection, but today, she looked like she d been through a hurricane. Her usually pristine bun was coming undone,dark circles shadowed her eyes, and she was juggling what looked like three different tablets along with a stack of binders.
"Oh. hi!" She attempted a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Going to Mr.Stark's office?"

"Yeah, project reports," I replied, holding up the folder. "Are you okay?You look..."

"Like total shit?" Monica finished with a bitter laugh. "Trust me,I know."

The elevator dinged for her floor before I could respond. She adjusted her grip on the precarious tower of materials.
"Good luck up there," she said as she stepped out. "Mr. Stark's in one of his moods today."
I frowned, concerned. "Wait,Monica-what's going on?"
Monica hesitated,glaneing around theempty hallway. "Annual party prep,"she admitted, lowering her voice. "Miss Sinclair insisted on taking charge but she's..." She pressed her lips together. "Let's just say I'm handling most of it myself."

"That sounds rough," I said sympathetically.

"It's fine." Monica replied, her professional mask slipping back into place. "
Mr. Stark's inside. Just proceed with caution."

"Thanks for the warning." I said as she hurried away.

The executive floor was unusually quiet as I stepped off the elevator.James Wilson nodded to me from his desk, his expression giving away nothing as usual.
"He's expecting you," was all he said, gesturing toward Brandon's office door.

Taking a deep breath, I knocked and entered without waiting for a response. Brandon was exactly where I expected him to be-behind his massive desk, staring at his computer screen with the intensity of someone contemplating murder. His fingers were pressed against his temples, and even from across the room, I could see the tension in his shoulders.
"Hey," I said softly, closing the door behind me.

Brandon didn't look up, but his posture shifted slightly at the sound of my voice.

"I have the revised reports," I continued, crossing the room to place the folder on his desk. Instead of returning to the chair opposite him, I circled around to stand behind him, my hands finding his shoulders.
"You're tense," I murmured, my fingers digging into the knots I found there. "Monica mentioned you were in a mood."

Brandon let out a short, humorless laugh. "Did she?"

"Mmm." I confirmed, working at a particularly stubborn knot. "She also looks like she hasn't slept in days. Annual party problems?"
Brandon reached for the folder I'd brought, flipping it open with one hand while the other caught mine, tugging me around to face him.

"Let's talk about your report first," he said, his eyes scanning the pages."This is much better than the last draft."
I felt a swell of pride. "Jean-Pierre's feedback was really helpful. We completely overhauled the environmental impact séction."
"I can see that," Brandon nodded, turning to a specific page. "These calculations are far more precise. Jean-Pierre seems to be taking a special interest in you."

"Really?" I asked, surprised. "I thought Leo was his protégé."

"Leo's already established," Brandon replied, closing the folder. "He doesn't need Jean-Pierre's mentorship anymore. You, on the other hand..." He squeezed my hand. "Jean-Pierre clealy sees your potential. His approach is different from Leo's-more innovative. You should take advantage of the opportunity."

"I will," I promised. His fingers were still playing with mine, absently tracing patterns across my palm. It was something he did when his mind was occupied with troubling thoughts.

"Anyway, what's going on with you? Monica said you were in a bad mood.
Is it work?"

Brandon's expression shuttered. "It's nothing significant."

"It's clearly something," I pressed. "You can tell me, you know."

He sighed, histhumb rubbing circles on the back of my hand. "Just the usual corporate politics. Nothing worth discussing."

I decided to change tactics. "So about this annual party... are you really leaving all the planning to Monica and Elle? That seems like asking for trouble."

Brandon's eyebrow arched. "What makes you say that?"

"Just office gossip," I shrugged. "People are saying you're not taking the party seriously this year. Apparently Elle isn't actually doing anything.and Monica's drowning in work."

"And what would you suggest?" he asked, his tone carefully neutral.

I backpedaled quickly. "Don't misunderstand me. Whether you send Elle away or keep her around doesn't matter to me at all. She can't touch what we have. Whatever you decide to do, I'll support you."

Something in Brandon's expression softened. "You're quite considerate,aren't you?"

"Of course I am," I replied with a smile. "It's inmy best interest to keep you happy."
I glanced at my watch and stood up. "I really need to get back downstairs.I'll meet you in the parking garage after work? Aunt Meave mentioned she's craving spicy fish head stew, so we need to pick up some fresh fish on
the way home."

"Uncle Gavin can't be bothered to buy it himself?" Brandon asked, his tone dry.
"He's keeping Aunt Meave company," I explained. "Her color has been much better lately, don't you think?"
Brandon nodded, rising to his feet. "I've noticed."

I reached up, my fingers brushing his jaw before leaning in to kiss him lightly. "Try not to terrorize too many people today, okay? I'll see you tonight."

\---

Brandon's POV

A few minutes after Summer left, the intercom buzzed.

"Mr. Stark," Monica's voice came through, "may I speak with you about the annual party?"
"Come in," I replied, returning to my desk.

Monica entered, looking considerably more disheveled than usual. After discussing several party details, she shifted uncomfortably.
"There's something else, sir," she said hesitantly. "Miss Sinclair saw Summer-Miss Taylor-leaving your office earlier.She seemed...upset."
"How upset?" I asked, my voice deliberately neutral.

"Very," Monica replied. "She asked me to investigate Miss Taylor. She wants to find something she can use to remove her from Stark Group."
I kept my expression carefully blank. "And what did you tell her?"

"That I wouId try." Monica admitted. "She insisted we're best friends now and invited me to dinner at that new French restaurant on Fifth Avenue."

"I see." I studied Monica's face for a moment. "Go ahead with the investigation."

Monica's eyes widened. "Sir?"

"James will provide you with information in a few days. Give it to Elle when she asks."

Monica looked confused but nodded. "Yes, Mr. Stark."

"Is there anything else about the annual party?".I asked, redirecting the conversation.

"Just the entertainment, sir. Stark Entertainment hasn't confirmed which artists will perform."
"Let James handle it," I decided. "You have enough on your plate."
###Chapter 208: Victoria's Best Shot

Sophie's POV

The Stark Entertainment conference room buzzed with hushed conversations as Quinn Hall, the lead producer, drummed her manicured nails against the polished table. I stood quietly in the corner, doing my best impression of wallpaper while keeping my ears open.
"So we're settled on Bianca and Cleo for the Stark Group annual party performances," Quinn announced. "Bianca's our headliner,naturally,and Cleo's new single drops that week."
The executives nodded, scribbling notes on tablets. These meetings were their battlefield-careers made or broken with a single decision.
"What about additional performers?" someone asked.

Quinn pursed her lips. "We're still finalizing the list. James Wilson from Stark Group is reviewing our recommendations."
The mention of James Wilson sent a ripple of tension through the room.Everyone knew he was Brandon Stark's right-hand man-his presence meant decisions were being made at the highest level.
"When does the final list need to be submitted?" a marketing exec asked.

"By the end of this week," Quinn replied. "And this isn't just about performances-it's about representation. Anyone who appears has Brandon Stark's stamp of approval."
I quickly texted Maya: *Meeting almost done. They've only confirmed Bianca and Cleo so far, Final list due end of week. James Wilson is here.*
My phone buzzed with Maya's immediate response: *Keep listening. On our way with Victoria.*
As people started filtering out, I edged toward the door, prepared to make my escape. I was almost in the clear when Quinn's voice stopped me.

"Sophie,right? Victoria's assistant?"

I turned, heart skipping. "Yes, Ms. Hall?"

Quinn's eyes narrowed. "What were you doing in this meeting?"

"I was asked to pick up materials for Maya Coleman," I lied smoothly. "About Victoria's series premiere schedule?"
Quinn seemed unconvinced but ultimately uninterested. "Fine. Just don't make a habit of sitting in on closed-door sessions."
\---

Victoria paced her dressing room like a caged panther, her Louboutins clicking against the floor tiles. Dark circles lurked beneath her eyes-remnants of her recent shooting schedule.
"This better be fucking important," Victoria snapped. "I just got back from Long Island. I'm exhausted, and Alexander's being impossible."

Maya shot me a warning glance before stepping in. "It's absolutely worth your time. You wouldn't want to miss this opportunity."

Victoria sank onto her custom leather sofa with a dramatic sigh. "What opportunity?"
"James Wilson is in the building," Maya said meaningfully. "Brandon Stark's right-hand man."
Victoria's eyebrow arched slightly. "So? Stark Group execs come here all the time."

"But this time, it's about the annual Stark Group party," Maya pressed. "They're finalizing the performance list-and you should be on it."

That caught Victoria's attention. She sat up straighter, fatigue replaced by interest. "The Stark Group annual party? What does that have to do with Stark Entertainment?"

Maya looked at me, signaling it was safe to join.

"Every year,Stark Entertainment provides performers for the party," I explained after closing the door. "It's a huge deal. Anyone selected is considered top-tier talent."
Maya nodded. "It's not just a performance opportunity, Victoria. It's a status symbol."
Victoria's eyes narrowed. "Who else is on the list?"

"Bianca and Cleo," I replied. "They're the only ones confirmed so far."

Victoria's face darkened. "Bianca? That talentless hack gets to perform, and I'm not even considered?"
Maya seized on her indignation. "Exactly! That's why we needed you here.The list isn't finalized, which means there's still a chance."

"And how exactly are we supposed to make that happen?" Victoria demanded,though I could tell she was already invested.
"Look," Maya said, lowering her voice, "this isn't just about a performance slot. The party is attended by every major player in New York business.
AlI the executives, their families, important clients."

Victoria's eyes glittered. "Media coverage?"

"Extensive," Maya confirmed. "And it's not just about exposure.If you perform, you'll have direct access to Brandon Stark himself."
"Brandon?" Victoria repeated, her interest piqued.

"One conversation with him could change everything," Maya continued. "He controls Stark Entertainment's direction."
I watched Victoria calculate the potential benefits-shrewd,strategic,always looking for the angle to advance her position.
"If your series premiere coincides with the annual party," I added, "it would be the perfect promotional opportunity."
Victoria's eyes lit up. "You're right. This is exactly what I need." She turned to Maya. "So what do we do? Talk to Quinn? She hates me."
"No," Maya shook her head. "Quinn's just middle management. We need to go straight to the source."
"James Wilson," I said.

Victoria nodded slowly. "He's here today, deciding who performs." She stood up,suddenly energized. "Then what are we waiting for?"
"I don't think barging into his meeting is the best approach," Maya cautioned. "We need to be strategic."
"And I don't have much experience dealing with James," Victoria admitted."I've only seen him from a distance,"
"Do either of you know what he likes?" I asked. "Any preferences we could leverage?"
Maya shook her head. "He's notoriously private. The only person who really knows him is Brandon Stark."
Victoria paced again. "Then what's our play here? I need to be on that list,Maya." Her voice took on a rare note of vulnerability. "I've been stuck filming this stupid TV series for months while my career stagnates.Horizon was ready to offer me a lead film role before I signed here."
"It'll happen." Maya assured her. "We just need the right approach."

I cleared my throat. "What if we wait for him in the parking garage? Catch him on his way out: when he's not surrounded by executives?"
Victoria and Maya both turned to look at me with surprise.

"That's... actually not a bad idea," Maya said slowly.

"If we approach him one-on-one, it feels less like an ambush," I continued.
"Conversations that happen 'by chance' often feel more genuine."

Victoria's eyes narrowed as she studied me. "Well, look at you, finally earning your paycheck."
"James Wilson has Brandon's ear," I emphasized. "One word from him carries more weight than all of Stark Entertainment's executives combined."
Maya nodded approvingly. "Sophie's right. This is our best shot."

"Fine," Victoria agreed. "We'll try it your way. But what do I say once we're there? What if he doesn't agree?"
A flash of anxiety crossed her face-a rare crack in her confident facade.
"Don't worry." Maya soothed. "We'll figure something out. You're Victoria Taylor-you've got this."
As Victoria gathered her things, I caught Maya's approving nod. The dynamic between us had shifted in recent months. I'd gone from being"the girl who got drugged at Victoria's party" to becoming an actual asset to her team. My ultimate goal remained the same-revenge for what Victoria had done to me-but the path was proving more complex than I'd anticipated.

"Let's go," Victoria said, her determination evident. "I'm not missing this opportunity."
###Chapter 209: What Goes Around Comes
Ar ound

**Sophie's POV**

"Are you sure he'll come this way?" Maya checked her watch nervously.

"Positive." I assured her, adjusting my blazer.

Right on cue, the elevator doors opened, and he emerged-Brandon Stark's right-hand man. Nothing particularly imposing about his appearance, but those eyes... sharp,assessing, missing absolutely nothing.
"What exactly are you two doing by my vehicle?" he asked, more curious than annoyed.
"Mr. Wilson!" we both straightened.

"Is there something I can help you with?" James twirled his key fob between his fingers.
Maya glanced around before stepping forward. "Mr. Wilson, could we speak privately? It'sabout the Stark Group annual party."
Amusement flickered across James's face. "The Stark Group annual party?Well,Ms. Coleman, aren't you well-informed." He pressed his key fob."How did you come by this information?"
"I have my sources," Maya replied confidently. "I was wondering if the performance lineup has been finalized yet?"
Maya reached into her bag, pulling out an envelope full of money. James eyed it but didn't take it.
His attention shifted to me. "And you're... the one who's always with Victoria Taylor,correct?"

"Sophie, sir. I'mn Victoria's assistant now."

"Assistant?" James arched an eyebrow. "Seems like a waste of your talents."

"You're too kind, Mr. Wilson," I replied. "About the Stark Group annual party-"
"Tell you what." James checked his watch. "This parking garage isn't ideal for conversation. I have about two hours free at lunch. Why don't you tell me then what you're offering?"
He dangled his car keys. "Would you ladies like to ride with me?"

"That won't be necessary," I gestured toward the black SUV nearby. "We drove."

James's eyes narrowed. "Ms. Taylor is here as well?"

"Yes,Mr.Wilson."

"Perfect. There's a decent restaurant nearby. If we're discussing business,we might as well do it properly."



Inside Victoria's SUV, she lounged in the back seat, oversized sunglasses hiding half her face.
"What did James say?" she demanded the moment we entered.

"He's agreed to talk," I explained. "But he wants to meet for lunch. Will you join us?"
Victoria frowned. "Have lunch with him? Seriously?"

"Sophie and I can go first," Maya suggested. "See what he's after. If he agrees, great. If not, we'll figure out another approach."
"Maya's right," I added. "We need this meeting. If you have other commitments, we can handle it."
Victoria removed her sunglasses. "You really do get me. I actually need to check in with Alexander. Just drop me at the next corner."
After Victoria exited, the atmosphere inside shifted immediately. My artificial smile slid away.
Maya eyed me suspiciously. "I thought you and Victoria were such great friends?"

"Oh, absolutely," I replied, my voice dripping with sarcasm. "Best friends forever. You of all people should know."
"I couldn't care less about whatever's going on between you two," Maya crossed her legs. "Just don't mess with my career or commission."
"Don't worry," I assured her, my voice soft but intent. "Victoria and I won't have any conflicts. After all, I'm her *dearest* friend. Everything I do is for Victoria's benefit."

Maya gave me a calculating look before shaking her head. We followed James's Mercedes in silence.
James waited for us outside an unmarked, exclusive restaurant,noting Victoria's absence without comment.
"Shall we?" he gestured toward the entrance.
The manager materialized immediately. "Mr. Wilson! What an honor!" he exclaimed,recognizing Brandon Stark's right-hand man. "Your usual table is ready."
In our private dining room, James tapped the table after we ordered.

"I had already made my decision before you approached me," he announced.

Maya and I exchanged glances.

"Victoria has excellent qualifications and a strong image," James continued."She's one of Stark Entertainment's priority talents. Including her in the annual party would be... appropriate."
Maya's shoulders sagged with relief. "You have excellent taste, Mr. Wilson."

"Do I?" His tone was unreadable.

"So Victoria wasn't already on the list?" Mlaya asked anxiously.

James leaned back. "That's not what I said. But while I can recommend names, the final decisionlies with Mr. Stark himself."
"But hasn't Brandon delegated Stark Entertainment's decisions to you?"Maya pressed.
Something flickered across James's face. "You seem remarkably well-informed about our management structure."
Maya backpedaled. "I didn't mean anything by it. Victoria is my client,and I want the best for her."
"Just wait for good news, Ms. Coleman," James said simply.
"Thank you. Mr.Wilson."

"No need to thank me."




After Maya left for an urgent call, I remained, watching James dab his mouth.

"Something on your mind?" he asked, catching my hesitation.

"Why are you giving Victoria this opportunity?" I blurted out."This will only make her career take off.She-"
"Isn't that a good thing?" James interrupted. "You're her best friend, aren't you? Shouldn't you be happy about her success?"
*Happy about her success?* My inner thoughts raged. *How could I possibly want Victoria to succeed? I'd rather see her fall into oblivion. Why else would I abandon my career to become her assistant? I'm here to watch her downfall. Why should Victoria rise while Anna and I were merely stepping stones?*

To my horror, tears welled in my eyes. James wordlessly handed me a napkin.

"I'm sorry," I mumbled, mortified. "Making a complete fool of myself."

"You should look forward," James said quietly. "What goes around, comes around."

"I can't wait that long," I admitted.

"Which would hurt Victoria more: watching her career end before it begins,or seeing her reach the absolute pinnacle before crashing spectacularly
back to earth? Which would be more...satisfying?"

I stared at him suspiciously. "Do you have some grudge against Victoria?"

Instead of answering, hhe adjusted his cuffs. "I'll be in touch. Keep me informed of developments. This arrangement is entirely voluntary."
"I understand," I assured him, regaining composure. "I'll report everything about Victoria. But don'tforget what you promised me."
"When I give my word, I keep it." James replied smoothly. "Just be patient.



He rose to leave, then paused. "One more thing-you have impressive qualities. Have you ever considered trying out for Stark Entertainment yourself?"
###Chapter 210: I Find Her Quite Remarkable

**Brandon's POV**

I scanned the performance lineup James had placed on my desk,immediately noting the one name conspicuously absent.
"Stark Entertainment doesn't have a single person who thinks Victoria's worth including?" I tossed the list onto my desk with deliberate casualness.
James shook his head. "From what I understand, Victoria isn't exactly a team player. She doesn't associate with the other artists. The veterans-she can't stand them. The newcomers-she looks down on them." He paused."Honestly, it's a miracle she's lasted this long in the industry. Must be her manager's doing. Otherwise, Victoria would have crashed and burned ages ago."

A smirk tugged at my lips. "Add her name to the list," I instructed,then glanced back at the paper. "Then Bianca and Cleo at the top, plus..." I scanned the remaining names and pointed randomly. "This one."
"I heard Victoria's manager approached you?" I asked, keeping my tone casual.

James's eyebrow twitched noticeably. "Yes." The surprise in his voice was genuine-he hadn't repored this encounter yet.
I looked up, giving him a flat stare. "Quinn was heading down to find you when she spotted Victoria's car in the parking garage."
"Maya wants to get Victoria into the Stark Group annual party," James explained. "Though I don't fully understand why you're allowing it,sir."
"Some things don't require your understanding, James. Just your execution.
"I handed the list back to him. "Inform Quinn it'll be these four. Have them prepare their performances."
After James left, my phone rang. Jane Sinclair. My mother.

"Brandon," her voice came through, sharp and accusatory, "I heard your uncle is staying at Hamptons estate?"
I raised an eyebrow but didn't answer her question. Her voice immediately took on that familiar edge-the sound of her rising temper.
Jane had been perfectly content not knowing about Gavin and Meave's whereabouts until someone mentioned they were sending items to my estate. For her, this was a slap in the face-her son maintaining a closer relationship with his aunt and uncle than with his own mother.
"Brandon," she said, her voice tightening, "I'm your mother, not Meave.All these years, you've been so good to her. Have you ever considered how that makes me feel?"

I could practically hear her teeth grinding. Her hatred for Meave was as predictable as it was tiresome.

"Brandon," she snapped, her voice rising, "I am your *biological*mother!"

"That fact doesn't require reminding, Mother. I've never denied it," I replied coldly.
"But the way you treat Meave-"

"My relationship with my aunt is my business," I cut in. "She's my uncle's wife, and she helped raise me. I see nothing inappropriate about how I treat her." I let my voice cool several degrees further. "May I remind you,Mother,that*you*were the one who abandoned me. So perhaps you
shouldn't demand too much now. Your name may be on my birth certificate as my mother, a fact no one can change-but nothing more."
"Brandon!" There was genuine fear in her voice now. She was afraid I'd say something even more cutting, expose some truth she preferred to keep hidden.

"If there's nothing else, Mother, I have work to do."

"Brandon!" She quickly interrupted before I could hang up."After all these years, you still can't forgive me? I've come back to make amends.Everything I've done has been for your benefit. Can't you forgive me? Let me stay at the Hamptons estate with you!"
"That won't be necessary," I refused without hesitation. "Uncle Gavin and Aunt Meave are there for a change of scenery that might help her condition. The Stark mansion has plenty of empty rooms if you're feeling bored. I'm an adult now. I neither need nor have time for your companionship."
I ended the call abruptly, my expression hardening. Only then did I notice Monica standing awkwardly near the door, clearly wishing she could disappear.
"You had something to discuss?" I prompted, refocusing her attention.

Monica snapped back to attention. "Yes, James just gave me Stark Entertainment's final lineup. I've done a preliminary arrangement.Since Bianca is their top performer, I've scheduled her second-to-last, right before your closing speech. As for Victoria... how would you like her positioned?"

"Place her wherever you think appropriate."
"And for your opening dance, who would you like to-" Monica hesitated.În previous years, this question had been unnecessary. I always chose Monica herself as my dance partner.
I knew she understood this wasn't due to any personal preference.I simply found it troublesome to select someone new, and I avoided physical contact with unfamiliar women. Monica had remained my assistant for years partly because she never harbored romantic notions about our relationship.
This year, however, Elle Sinclair's presence complicated matters. If I maintained tradition and danced with Monica, Elle might make life difficult for her. But more importantly, I suspected Monica sensed something had changed this year.
I raised an eyebrow, giving her an approving look. "What do you think?"I prompted.
"I think we should try something fresh this year," Monica replied carefully."Perhaps you havre someone else in mind?"
I looked at her expectantly, encouraging her to continue.

"What if we used a random selection process? It could be a morale boost for female employees."
I narrowed my eyes slightly. "Are you suggesting I use my physical appearance as an incentive,Monica?"
"No, not at all!" she backpedaled quickly. "I just thought we have many exceptional female employees." She met my eyes directly. "For instance,Summer Taylor from Projects. I find her quite remarkable-attractive,articulate, and extraordinarily kind."
I felt my expression soften involuntarily at Summer's name. Monica,perceptive as ever, immediately noticed and continued with renewed confidence.

"I think Summer is wonderful. Stark Group needs more faces like hers-positive, energetic, full of life."
"Proceed as you suggested," I agreed. "Handle the selection process carefully."

"Right away, sir," Monica replied, visibly relieved.

"Monica," I called, stopping her at the door. "Once this month's work is complete, your salary will increase by ten percent next year."
Her face lit up instantly. "Thank you, Mr. Stark! I won't disappoint you."

For employees like Monica, tangible rewards always meant more than verbal praise.
Once alone, I pulled out the annual party planning book from my drawer.Normally, I wouldn't concern myself with these details, but this year included unpredictable elements. Í needed to ensure everything went exactly as I wanted with minimal effort.
My fingers drummed thoughtfully against the desktop as an idea formed.I pulled out my phone and dialed Summer.
"Gavin and Meave want some time alone today," I said when she answered."Let's go out for dinner."
There was a brief pause. "Gavin and Meave?" Summer asked,confusion evident in her voice. "Is today special for some reason?"
###Chapter 211: Obsession is a Disease

**Summer's POV**

"Their wedding anniversary," Brandon explained through the phone. "Aunt Meave hasn't been feeling well lately, so Uncle Gavin didn't want to take her out. They're celebrating at home, so we should probably give them some space tonight."
I shifted the phone to my other ear while organizing the Manhattan West Side project files. "That's fine. We can grab dinner somewhere else."
"I'll swing by and pick you up after work," Brandon said. "You're not working late tonight,are you?"
"Nope, I'll be done on time."

"Good." I could hear the smile in his voice, that softness he reserved just for me. "Where do you want to eat? Or maybe a movie? It's been a while since we've gone out on a proper date with all the craziness at work lately."
"A date?" I laughed. "We're already married, you know."

"All the more reason," Brandon replied.

"Alright, I should get back to work," I said reluctantly.

"Me too. I've got a mountain of things to finish before I can leave."

After we hung up, I couldn't help the smile that spread across my face.Even after all this time, Brandon still made my heart flutter with just a simple phone call.
"Well, someone's in a good mood."
I looked up to find Heather leaning against my desk, a knowing smile on her face.
"Was that your boyfriend?" she asked, eyebrows wiggling suggestively.

"Boyfriend?" I bit my lip. "Yeah, I guess you could say that."

Heather's eyes widened. "Wait, you actualy have a boyfriend? For real?"

"Why do you look so shocked?" I raised an eyebrow. "Do I seem like I can't get a date or something?"
"No! God, no." Heather backpedaled quickly. "You're gorgeous and super nice-of course guys would be lining up for you. I just... you never talk abouIt your personal life."
"Well, now you know," I said with a shrug.

"You should bring him around sometime," Heather suggested. "I'm dying to meet the guy who put that smile on your face."
I laughed,imagining her reaction if I showed up with Brandon Stark, CEO of the entire company. "Maybe someday."
Heather nodded. "Fair enough. I should get back to work before Leo catches me slacking off."



By 5:30, I was more than ready to leave. I texted Brandon as I rode the elevator down to the parking garage.
*On my way down. Where are you?*

His reply came immediately: *Still in a meeting. Should be done in 15.
Wait in the car if you get there first. Keys are with James.*

After collecting the keys, I made my way to Brandon's reserved spot and slipped inside his car. I was scrolling through restaurant options when the elevator doors pinged open. My head snapped up, but instead of Brandon,Elle Sinclair stepped out.
My stomach dropped. I reflexively slouched down, praying she wouldn't notice me. She walked directly toward Brandon's car and positioned herself rightnext to the driver's side door.
Suddenly, Elle turned and pressed her face against the window,peering inside. My heart nearly stopped. Her face was inches from mine,separated only by the glass. I froze, not daring to breathe.
But after a long moment, Elle straightened and returned to leaning against the car, absently scrolling through her phone. That's when I remembered-the windows were tinted. She couldn't see me at all; she was just checking if Brandon was already inside.
With trembling fingers, I texted Brandon: *EMERGENCY! Elle Sinclair is waiting by your car. I'm inside. She doesn't know I'm here.HELP!!!*
Brandon's reply came swiftly: *Stay calm. I'm on my way down.*

Two minutes later, the elevator doors opened again, and Brandon emerged with his coat draped over one arm. His eyes immediately scanned the garage until they landed on Elle, his expression darkening instantly.
He sent me another text: *Are you okay?*

I replied with a panicked emoji: *In car. She doesn't know I'm here.*

A hint of a smile touched Brandon's lips before his face returned to its
impassive mask. He strode forward, his posture rigid with annoyance.

Elle spotted him and brightened. "Brandon!" she called, stepping toward him with outstretched arms.
Brandon stopped abruptly. "Don't touch me."

Elle pouted, dropping her arms. "But Brandon, we're going to be together eventually. I know you don't like people touching you, but I'm diffeent."
"What are you doing here?" he demanded.

"I wanted to go home with you, of course." Elle's voice turned sickly sweet."You haven't been home in ages. Jane misses you so much. And I didn't drive today, and the Stark mansion is so far away. Can't you give me a ride?"
"You don't have money?"

Elle looked confused. "Of course I have money. Stark Group pays well,and Jane gives me an allowance. Why are you asking about money?"
"If you have money, take a taxi," Brandon replied flatly. "Or rent a car.You seem to have plenty of cash-rent a Rolls Royce if you want."
"Brandon!" Elle's voce took on a whining quality. "You know that's not what I meant. I just want to go home with you!"
Brandon's eyes narrowed. "I see you have money but nothing else."

"What's that supposed to mean? I don't understand what you're saying!"

"You're not trying to understand. You're just pretending to be stupid. That s your specialty."
"Brandon, how can you say that?" Elle's voice rose. "I'm still-"

"The only reason I've tolerated you this long is out of respect for the Sinclair family," Brandon cut her off. "But if you keep pushing your luck,don't blame me for what happens next. Move aside."
"You can't treat me like this!" Elle cried. "We're engaged! You're supposed to be nice to me. Is there someone else? Is that it? Brandon, I'm not mnad-I really do love you. If you've been seeing someone, just break it off. We can'pretend it never happened."
Brandon's expression turned to one of pure disgust. "Have you lost your mind? I'll say this one last time: move. If you don't, you're not just getting kicked out of Stark Group-I'll make sure you can't show your face anywhere in New York."

Brandon was suddenly opening the driver's side door. I opened my mouth to say something, but Brandon silenced me with a look. He reached over and squeezed my hand reassuringly.
I managed a weak smile as we both fastened our seatbelts, and Brandon wasted no time starting the engine and peeling out of the parking spot.
Through the rear window, I could see Elle scramble to her feet-apparently Brandon's exit had been forceful enough to knock her down.She ran a few steps after the car, her face contorted with rage.
"Brandon!" she screamed. "No matter how much you reject me, you can't change the fact that I'll be your wife someday! I'll make you want to marry me,you'll see!"
Brandon's jaw tightened as he accelerated up the exit ramp, leaving Elle and her delusions behind us.
I exhaled, not realizing I'd been holding my breath. "That was intense."

Brandon's only response was to tighten his grip on the steering wheel as we merged into the evening traffic of Manhattan.
###Chapter 212: Date Night

**Summer's POV**

Brandon's knuckles turned white on the steering wheel as we pulled away from Stark Tower. The tension radiating off him was palpable, filling the car like a physical presence.
I reached over, gently placing my hand over his on the wheel, stroking small circles against his skin. His shoulders gradually lowered,and that dangerous energy began to dissipate.
He glanced over, his expression softening when he caught sight of my worried face.
"You're not upset?" he asked, his voice surprisingly steady.

I let out a relieved breath. "Why would I be upset?" I smiled.

"Those things she said," he replied, obvious concern in his voice. "I thought you'd be bothered!"
I raised an eyebrow. "What kind of person do you think I am? Why would I care what she says?" I squeezed his hand. "You're completely mine now, so what is there to worry about? If anyone should be concerned,it's her."


A small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.

"You know," I continued, my tone lighthearted, "I should actually thank Elle Sinclair. I had no ideayou cared about me this much!"
Brandon shot me a look, "Really? After everything I've done, you still couldn't tell?"
He exhaled slowly. "As long as you're not bothered, I don't careeither.Before you came into my life, these things weren't worth my attention. But now that you're here, I obviously can't allow this situation to continue."His voice grew more serious. "Just give me some time. I'll handle it properly and give you a satisfactory resolution."
"I'm not in a rush," I said, studying his profile.

I understood his predicament. Elle Sinclair's situation was awkward-protected by the Sinclair family and Jane's influence,she'd developed this unhealthy fixation on Brandon. And Jane Sinclair was still his mother. He couldn't cross certain lines with her, no matter how strained their relationship was.
"You don't need to worry about my feelings," I told him softly. "Handle things according to your own plan. This situation needs resolution eventually, but don't put yourself in an impossible position because of me."
Brandon nodded, a smile playing on his lips."June."

I looked up. "Yeah? What is it?"

His eyes softened. "Having you makes everything better."




I stared up at the restaurant sign in surprise. This tiny place near Columbia University was about the last place I'd expected Brandon to take me for dinner.
Brandon squeezed my hand. "Something wrong? You don't like it?"

"No, no," I shook my head quickly. "I'm just surprised you'd come to a place like this. Ruby, Scarlett, and I used to eat here all the time during
college. I haven't been back since graduation, though."

I tugged him inside, the warmth immediately enveloping us. "It looks exactly the same as when we were students."
We found a quiet corner booth. The place was filling up quickly with students grabbing dinner after evening classes. Their energy and optimism were almost contagious, and I felt a pang of nostalgia for my own college days.

A harried server eventually made it to our table. I ordered without needing to look at the menu-just two main dishes and soup,remembering how enormous the portions were.
"Will that be enough?" I asked Brandon after the server left.

Brandon shook his head. "This is plenty."

As we waited, I noticed a group of girls near the entrance staring in our direction, whispering among themselves.
"...think he's from our school?" one asked, her voice just loud enough for us to hear.
"No way," her friend replied. "Have you seen anyone that gorgeous at Columbia?"
"Maybe he's a professor? Or someone from administration?"

Brandon's eyebrow quirked up. "They think you're beautiful," he murmured.
I grinned. "Pretty sure they're talking about you." I changed the subject."That's weird-shouldn't the university be onbreak right now?"
"Probably soon," Brandon replied. "It's been so long since I was in school,I can't remember the schedule anymore."

"Same," I admitted. "These days I only remember when to clock in and out of work."
Our food arrived quickly. Brandon sanitized our utensils before handing me mine. "Eat up," he said gently. "After this, we could take a walk. James got us movie tickets at the theater nearby."
My eyes lit up. "So this really is a proper date night!"

"When have I ever lied to you?" Brandon asked warmly. "Now eat before it gets cod." He placed a bite of food in my bowl. "Try It-see if it's good."
The food wasn't amazing compared to our usual restaurants,but there was something comforting about it. It tasted like simpler times.



The river path near Columbia was peaceful at night. Brandon held my hand firmly, tucking it into his coat pocket to keep it warm. I had to take tiny steps to keep up with his longer stride, which probably looked ridiculous, but I didn't care.
"Brandon," I said softly, breaking our comfortable silence.

"Hmm?" he responded.

"By the way," I asked, "what movie did James book tickets for?"

Brandon turned to look at me. "I'm not sure. I told him to choose something appropriate. Unless... you don't want to see amovie?"
I bit my lip. "To be honest, I don't think there. .
playing right now."

"Then we won't go." Brandon said decisively. "Is there somewhere else you'd like to go instead?"
I shook my head. "Not really. Maybe we should still see the movie though.Seems a waste to let the tickets go unused."
"It doesn't matter," Brandon said, squeezing my hand. "Let's just walk for a while."
He suddenly frowned. "Why are your hands stll so cold?"

"Oh, that's normal for me," I explained. "My hands are always freezing in winter. Don't worry about it."
I wiggled my fingers playfully. "See? They're warming up already."

Brandon's eyes traced over my coat. "You should dress warmer when we go out. This is too thin."
I pulled my hand free and gestured at my heavy wool coat. "This isn't thin! I'm wearing plenty of layers. You're the one who ditched your coat earlier. Aren't you freezing in just that suit?"
"It got dirty," he said simply, then added, "I'm not cold when you're with me."
I couldn't help but shiver-not from cold, but from the intensity in his eyes. My cheeks flushed. "That's ridiculous. I'm not a spaceheater."
"You're better than any heater to me," Brandon replied, his voice dropping to that deep register that always made my heart skip.
"Has anyone ever told you that your pick---
asked, surprised by this romantic side of him. "I don't stand a chance when you talk like that."

The corner of Brandon's mouth lifted. "No one has," he said firmly. "My sweet words are only for you. No one before, no one now, no one after."

My heart swelled. I reached up to touch his face, stroking his cheek before playfully pinching it. "God, what am I supposed to do when you say things like that?"

Brandon caught my wandering hand, holding it against his face.The tenderness in his eyes nearly took my breath away. "I'Il say things like that every day if it makes you happy."
###Chapter 213: I'll Carry You Home

**Summer's POV**

Brandon and I had been walking along the riverside path for over an hour,our footsteps falling into a comfortable rhythm as students from Columbia occasionally passed by.

It struck me then how much my life had changed. Before Brandon, I'd been constantly scrambling-fighting for respect from the Taylors,struggling to stand on my own feet. But with Brandon, that feeling had disappeared. His strength wasn't just physical-it was the quiet certainty that with him, I would never again feel lost.

I breathed in the crisp air, savoring this rare moment of peace.

"What are you thinking about?" Brandon's deep voice pulled me from my thoughts.

I was about to answer when something caught my eye on the pedestrian bridge ahead. A young couple-probably Columbia students-were engaged in what looked like a playful argument. The girl was swaying slightly, one hand tugging at her boyfriend's jacket.

I couldn't help but smile at the scene.

"What's so funny?" Brandon asked, following my gaze.

"Nothing, I just..." I sighed contentedly. "Sometimes I forget how beautiful the world can be."


We watched as the boy crouched down, extending his hands behind him.The girl's face lit up with a victorious grin. She took a few steps back,hitched up her skirt, and made a running leap onto his back.
She jumped with too much enthusiasm, nearly sending them both toppling over. The boy caught her just in time.

"Jesus, Rachel!" we heard him scold. "Could you be any more reckless?Good thing I caught you! What would've happened if I didn't?"

The girl just giggled, wrapping her arms around his neck. "Come on, get up! You promised you'd carry me."

He stood with a theatrical groan. "Seriously though, what if I hadn't caught you?"


"Then I would've fallen, duh!" she replied cheerfully. "But I would've dragged you down with me."

"You're impossible," he sighed.

"That's called sharing the good times *and* the bad, babe," she declared.

I shook my head as they disappeared, unable to contain my laughter.

Brandon was watching me, not the couple. His eyes held that intensity that still made my heart skip.

"Want to try it?" he asked suddenly.

I blinked. "Try what?"

"Carrying you," Brandon clarified. "I'll carry you home."

"Are you serious?" I scoffed. "No way!"

I turned and marched ahead. Behind me, I heard Brandon's footsteps quicken. Before I could react, he had caught up and-in one smooth motion-swept me up into his arms.
"Brandon" I squealed. "What are you doing?!"

"You said you didn't want me to carry you on my back," he replied matter-of-factly. "So I'm carrying you like this instead."

"Put me down!" I hissed, mortified. My eyes darted around at the amused glances from passersby. "Everyone's looking!"

My face burning, I buried my head against his chest. "This is so embarrassing," I mumbled into his coat.




When we arrived back at the Hamptons estate, I was surprised to see lights still on in the living room. Brandon had finally put me down before we reached the front door but was still holding my hand as we stepped inside.


Gavin and Meave were sitting on the sofa,watching a late-night show.

"Uncle Gavin, Aunt Meave," Brandon said, caught off guard. "You're still up?"

Gavin's eyes twinkled with amusement. "Coming back so late? Must have been quite the date night."

I felt my face flush as I quickly knelt to take off my boots and hand Brandon his slippers.

"We just wanted to give you two some privacy," Brandon explained."I figured you wouldn't get much alone time at the Stark mansion."

Gavin chuckled. "Ah, yes, make it sound like you did it all for our benefit."

He turned to me. "Did you have a good time today, Summer?"
"We had a wonderful time," I replied. "Brandon mentioned it's your wedding anniversary today. I hope you had a lovely celebration."

"Oh, we did," Meave said, exchanging a fond look<with Gavin.

"Actually," I added, reaching into my bag, "we got you something while we were out." I pulled out a small gift box. "It's nothing fancy, but we thought you might like it."

Meave eagerly opened it to reveal a beautifully crafted protection charm.

"We got it from that old church near Columbia University," I explained."It s supposed to bring protection and good health. I know it's just symbolic,but better safe than sorry, right?"

Meave's eyes shone. "Summer, this is so thoughtful! I absolutely love it."

While Meave was admiring her gift, I went to make some tea. When I returned, Brandon and Gavin were deep in conversation.

"-so naturally you'll be hosting again this year," Gavin was saying. "I don't need to be there cluttering up the stage."

I set the tray down. "You're not attending the annual party, Uncle?" I asked. "But aren't you a major Stark Group shareholder? Even if you're not actively involved anymore, you're still part of the company."

Gavin hesitated. "I'd rather not," he admitted. "Meave hasn't been feeling her best lately, and those parties can be overwhelming. I'm concerned it might be too much for her."

"Nonsense," Meave interrupted. "Summer's right, Gavin. You're a Stark Group shareholder-you can't keep skipping the annual party. My health is fine. You could go by yourself. The staff can look after me."
"Absolutely not!" Gavin replied vehemently. "Brandon always handles these events perfectly. I'd rather stay home with you."

Meave sighed. "Gavin, you're making me feel like a burden."

"Don't ever say that," Gavin said, his voice softening as he took her hand. "You've never been a burden. Nothing is more important to me than you."He paused. "If it means that much to you, I'll attend. But only if you come with me-just for a brief appearance."

Meave nodded, satisfied. "Brandon, how are the preparations coming along?"


"Everything's almost ready," Brandon replied. "The evënt is in five days.I'd be honored if you'd both attend."

A brief silence fell before Meave ventured, "And your parents..."

"I assume..." Brandon said, his tonecarefully neutral, "They'll be there."
###Chapter 214: Are You Planning Something fa Tomorrow?

Summer's POV

The morning buzz at Stark Group headquarters felt different today.People huddled in small groups, hushed conversations breaking off as others walked by. Something was definitely up.

Monica appeared in the Projects department doorway, carrying a small box tucked under one arm while consulting a tablet with laser-like focus.

Leo emerged from his office just as Monica spotted him. "Monica, what brought you down to Projects?" He glanced at her tablet. "Does Brandon have new instructions?"

"No special instructions from Brandon," she replied, setting her box on the nearest desk. "I'm here on a mission of my own." She reached inside and pulled out two small cards attached to lanyards-one red, one blue. "The blue one is for you, Director Schmidt. And this red one is for Miss Taylor."

I stepped forward, examining the red card attached to a red lanyard she handed me.


"What's this about?" I asked, turning the tag over in my hands."Something for the annual party?"

"Exactly," Monica confirmed, checking names off her list. "Everyone make sure to keep these safe. You only get one, and they're essential for the annual party this year."

Heather swooped in like a hawk. "Monica, what are these number tags for?Is there something special happening at the annual party this year?"
Monica's lips curved into a secretive smile. "Keep it safe. Everyone only gets one. Red lanyards for ladies, blue for gentlemen. Don't lose them, or youi'll miss out on something good."

Heather's eyes widened. "Something good? Wait, are the prizes better this year? Last year's grand prize was a car-don't tell me it's something even better this time!"

"Your guess isn't too far off," Monica replied cryptically. "It's definitely a worthwhile perk."


I caught Monica's eyes darting toward me briefly, something knowing in her expression that made me instantly suspicious.

Leo cleared his throat. "If you're alldone gossiping about perks, perhaps we could get back to work? It's still business hours."

He turned to me, handing me a folder. "Summer, I need you to review these blueprint adjustments with Jean-Pierre's team. Make sure they're aligned with our environmental impact statements before we proceed."

"Got it," I nodded, accepting the folder.

As I returned to my desk and dove into the blueprints, Heather sidled up thirty minutes later.

"So," she whispered conspiratorially, "aren't you the least bit curious about what these are for?" She dangled her red-lanyard number tag.

I glanced up briefly. "Hmm? Oh, the tags. Yeah, I guess."

′′YOu∗guess∗?′′Heather looked appalled. "Monica practically confirmed it's some kind of amazing perk! Aren't you dying to know what it is?"
I shrugged, turning back to my blueprints. "Well, you said it's about the annual party, right? We'll find ouat then anyway. I really need to finish this before my meeting."

Heather stared at me like I'd sprouted a second head. "God,Summer,you're such a workaholic! I totally misjudged you. When you first started, I thought you were just some pretty face who got in through connections.But you're actually worse than Leo when it comes to work ethic."

I couldn't help but smile at that. "Thanks... ÍI think?"

As soon as Heather left, I pulled the number tag from my drawer and examined it more closely. Why would Brandon have Monica distribute these? And why separate colors by gender?

I grabbed my phone and opened WhatsApp.

*Monica's handing out these number tags. This was your idea?* I texted Brandon.

His reply came almost instantly:*Yes.*

*Something about perks at the annual party?* I pressed.

*Care to guess?* came his response.

I rolled my eyes. *I'm not playing guessing games. I'll find out at the party anyway.*




"This is all your fault," I groaned, staring helplessly at the array of dresses spread across our bed. "You said I need to look good but also stay warm.Do you have any idea how impossible that combination is for formal wear?
It was the evening before the annual party, and Brandon had just returned from discussing something with Gavin in his study.

"You're overthinking this," he said, crossing to the bed and picking up a sleek black dress with subtle white accents. "What's wrong with this one?"

"That's not even a dress!" I protested. "That's just-"

"Just what?" Brandon's eyebrow arched in challenge.

"Nothing!" I backpedaled, knowing it was the dress I'd worn on our first real date.

"So just to be clear," I said, taking the dress from him, "you want me to look nice but not too flashy, basically like I do every day?"

"You always look beautiful," he said simply. "It's just an annual party."

"Fine, this one it is. Where's the party being held?"

"Manhattan Club," Brandon replied, hanging up the other dresses. "We initially planned to hold it at Stark Tower,but with everything going on at the company lately, it would have disrupted operations."

I nodded, then remembered the mystery. "By the way, about those number tags-do you have one too? Heather's been driving me crazy all day trying to figure out what kind of perk they're for."

A smile played at the corner of Brandon's mouth. "Is it Heather who's curious,or you?"

"Fine, you caught me," I admitted. "So are you going to tell me what they're for?"
atte secre,he replied, his eyes twinkling. "If I tell you now, it ruins the surprise. I promise my wife will be pleased."

"Don't say things like that," I warned, lowering my voice. "Remember,hardly anyone knows we're married. If people at Stark Group find out during the annual party, it could get complicated."

"Don't worry," Brandon assured me, his hand finding mine."I know what I'm doing. You'll go with the Projects team tomorrow, and Leo will look after you."

"I know, I know. I'm a grown woman, Brandon. I understand what's appropriate and what's not. I know you'll be busy tomorrow-I won't get in your way."

I studied his face, trying to decipher what was going on behind those dark eyes. "Why do I feel like you're hiding something from me? Are you planning something for tomorrow?"
###Chapter 215: The Annual Party Begins

**Summer's POV**

Six o'clock found me hunched over blueprints in the nearly empty Projects department. Most of my colleagues had already rushed home to transform themselves for tonight's Stark Group annual party, but I remained absorbed in the Manhattan West Side environmental impact assessments.

"If we adjust these filtration systems here," I pointed out to Leo, who stood beside mne, "we can reduce the runoff by another fifteen percent without increasing costs."

Leo nodded thoughtfully. "Jean-Pierre's calculations check out. It's impressive work."

We continued until Leo suddenly glanced at his watch.

"Aren't you going to head out?" he asked, looking surprised. "Everyone else cleared out of here like the building was on fire."

I shrugged, gathering some papers. "Oh, it's fine. The party doesn't start until eight. Manhattan Club isn't far from here-we don't need to rush."

Leo raised an eyebrow. "Most women I know would be halfway through their makeup routine by now. Don't you need time to get ready?"

I smiled, closing my laptop. "I've got a change of clothes in my car.Won't take long."

"That's refreshing," Leo remarked. "Are you heading straight to Manhattan Club?"


"Actually," Leo said, somewhat hesitantly, "my car's in the shop. I was
wondering if I could catch a ride with you?"

"Of course! Meet you downstairs in ten minutes?"

Ten minutes later, I stood by my car in the parking garage, already changed into my evening attire. I'd swapped my work blazer for a sleek black coat that hung to my knees, its minimal design highlighting my silhouette without being flashy.

Leo emerged from the elevator looking completely transformed. Gone was the stern director of Projects; in his place stood a sophisticated gentleman in a tailored charcoal suit.

"Wow," I said appreciatively. "You clean up nicely, Director Schmidt."

Leo's eyes widened slightly."I could say the same about you. Very elegant.



As we pulled onto the street, Leo pulled out his phone, his thumbs moving rapidly over the screen.

"Sorry," he said, not looking up. "Catching up with an old friend I haven't seen in ages."

We drove in comfortable silence before Leo spoke again.

"Everyone else seems on edge about tonight's party, but you seem completely unfazed. Why is that?"

I glanced at him briefly. "Should I be nervous?"

He studied me. "I've been meaning to ask you something. You and Brandon Stark... there's more to that relationship than most people know,isn't there?"
I tensed slightly but kept my expression neutral. Leo already knew more than most people, and Brandon seemed to trust him.

"There's not much to hide, I guess," I admitted. "Brandon and I haven't been married long, and we haven't told many people. And yes, he did pull some strings to get me into Stark Group."

Leo nodded thoughtfully. "That explains a lot. You know, when you first started. I wasn't particularly thrilled about having you thrust into my department."


"I noticed." I replied dryly. "Is this your way of getting back at me now?"

Leo laughed-a genuine, warm sound I rarely heard from him at work. "Not at all. You've earned your place in Projects, regardless of how you got in."


The main hall of Manhattan Club had been transformed into a glittering wonderland. Most of Stark Group's employees were already present,mingling with drinks in hand.

As Leo and I entered together, a ripple of whispers spread through the crowd.

"Look, isn't that Director Schmidt from Projects andI Summer?" a woman in accounting stage-whispered.

"Why are they arriving together?" came the reply.

"There must be something going on between them," another voice added."Both single, both good-looking... and now coming to the annual party together?"
I couldn't help noticing how these rumors spread like wildfire.

A choking sound drew my attention to the bar, where Heather was struggling not to spit out her drink. Her eyes were comically wide as she stared at us, clearly having overheard the gossip.

She practically dragged me to a quiet corner.

"What the heIl, Summer?" she hissed. "You show up at the last minute,looking like *that*, with Director Schmidt?" She gestured wildly at my attire.

"What's wrong with how I look?"

"That's exactly what I'm asking!" Heather exclaimed."Where's your dress?Everyone's dressed to the nines, and you look like you're heading to a funeral!"

"This is what I'm wearing," I replied firmly. "It's elegant, appropriate, and comfortable."

"The problem is you just walked in with Leo Schmidt, and now everyone thinks you two are a thing!"

I patted her shoulder reassuringly. "Heather, relax. Nothing is going on between us."

"It's not that dramatic," I interrupted. "Director Schmidt is an excellent leader, and any woman would be lucky to have him. But that woman isn't me."


As Heather continued fretting, I felt an uncomfortable sensation-like someone was watching me. I turned slowly, scanning the crowd until my eyes landed on Elle Sinclair.
She stood frozen near one of the pillars, staring at me with an expression of disbelief. Her gaze was intense enough to make my skin crawl, and I quickly looked away.

A hush fell over the crowd. All heads turned toward the grand staircase,where Brandon had just appeared.

He looked absolutely devastating in a perfectly tailored black suit. James Wilson and Desmond flanked him, both immaculately dressed but clearly there in a professional capacity.

The staff snapped to attention, a choreographed display of respect for the CEO.

Elle Sinclair immediately made a beeline for Brandon.

"Brandon, you're here!"

One of the security personnel smoothly intercepted her,blocking her path.

"Brandon, look at how they're treating me!" she complained loudly.

Brandon's gaze swept over her, cold and dismissive. The warning in his eyes was clear-*don't cause a scene*.

Jane Sinclair materialized beside her daughter, the picture of maternal concern.


"Brandon," she said, her voice just loud enough to carry, "Elle is your cousin.Surely at an event like this, you could show her a little respect?"

Brandon's expression didn't soften. "Respect is earned, not given," he replied evenly before turning away.

He moved through the crowd with practiced ease until he reached Robert,
Gavin,and Meave.

"Father, Uncle, Aunt Meave," he greeted them warmly. "Thank you for coming."


Robert nodded approvingly. "Everything looks excellent."

Brandon motioned to James, who immediately stepped forward to escort the Stark family elders to their reserved table.

I noticed how deliberately Brandon had excluded Jane from his greeting.and the way her eyes followed Gavin and Meave with barely concealed resentment.

James returned to Brandon's side, murmuring something in his ear.
Brandon immediately scanned the room, his gaze finally landing on me.Our eyes locked across the crowded space, and a small smile played at the
corners of his mouth.

I couldn't help returning the smile, giving him a tiny wave that only he would notice.

The moment was broken by a commotion at the entrance. Stark Entertainment's stars had arrived, and they were making sure everyone knew it.


Bianca led the procession, her status as the agency's top talent evident in her confident stride. She was followed by Cleo, then Quinn Hall, with Victoria bringing up the rear.

All four women were dressed like they'd stepped off a runway. Victoria's gown was particularly eye-catching-ân exclusive Allen creation that highlighted her perfect figure.
The crowd parted.employees craning their necks for a better look at the celebrities. This was a rare treat for most of Stark Group's workers.

Victoria's eyes scanned the room, immediately zeroing in on Brandon.Her face lit up. and she quickened her pace, leaving her entourage behind.

"Uncle Brandon!" she called out, somehow making his name sound both professional and intimate. "It's been agest
###Chapter 216:Publicly Humiliated

**Victoria's POV**

Brandon barely acknowledged me with the slightest upward curve of his lips. His eyes,however, remained cold and distant-regarding me as though I were just another party guest rather than family. The subtle dismissal made my carefully practiced smile falter for just a moment.

Across the room. I spotted Summer standing in the corner with Leo Schmidt. They'd arrived together, and the rumor mill was already spinning.



"Who is that woman?" I heard someone whisper nearby. "How does she know Brandon Stark well enough to call him 'uncle'?"

"Didn't you see? She came in with Bianca and theothers from Stark Entertainment. She must be one of their talents."

"I think I've seen heron TV. Victoria Taylor, right? She's that actress..."

"But what's her connection to our CEO?"

Just as I was about to, speak again, a blonde woman in an extravagant evening gown pushed through the crowd. Her face was twisted with fury as she stormed toward me.

"Who the hell do you think you are?" she snarled, shoving me backward."You think you can just waltz in here and claim Brandon as your uncle?"

I stumbled, nearly falling flat on my ass before Sophie caught me by the elbow. *What the actual fuck?*

"'Uncle'? You're calling Brandon 'uncle'?" The blonde's voice rose to a
shrill pitch. "Tve known Brandon my entire life, and I've never heard of you! How dare you pretend to be family!"

I steadied myself, raising an eyebrow at this unexpected obstacle. "And you are...?" I asked, deliberately keeping my tone polite but dismissive.

"Someone you can't afford to mess with!" she snapped back, then turned toward Brandon. "Brandon, who is this woman? Why is she calling you uncle'? I've grown up with you, and I've never seen her before!"

She wasn't finished. "Don't think wearing some fancy dress makes you special," she continued, her voice dripping with venom. "Since the whole Stark family is here, along with all the company employees, we might as well clear this up right now. Otherwise, you'll go around lying to everyone.Jane and Robert are right over there-let's ask if they know who you are."

From my peripheral vision, I could see Summer watching from the corner.a satisfied smirk playing on her lips. *That little bitch is enjoying this!*

"Oh my God, what's happening now?" someone whispered loudly enough for me to hear.


The blonde woman raised her voice even more. "Aunt Jane! Come look at this wwoman! Is she actually related to the Stark family? I've never heard you mention her before. Uncle Robert, do you know her?"

Robert Stark-Brandon's father-frowned slightly as he studied me."Perhaps she's the daughter of one of Brandon's friends?" he suggested,sounding uncertain.


Jane Sinclair-Brandon's mother-let out a derisive snort. "Brandon's friends? Aren't they all around his age? How could any of them have a daughter her age?"
My face burned with humiliation as my carefully constructed facade began crumbling around me. I had to salvage this somehow.

"Uncle Brandon." I pleaded, my voice betraying my desperation, "please tell them... I'm not actually Brandon's family, but my husband is! His name is Alexander Stark, and my father-in-law is Alexander Sr. Surely that gives me the right to call you 'uncle'?"

Jane Sinclair's laughter cut through me like a knife. "Oh. *that* Alexander!Who told you they're related to us? Not everyone with the Stark name belongs to our family."

My confidence shattered completely. I could feel the blood draining from my face, then rushing back, then draining again. I turned to Brandon, my last hope. "Uncle... I mean, Mr. Stark, please say something. I truly didn't know..."


Brandon finally broke his silence, interrupting my pathetic plea. "Enough!Ms. Taylor may not have known, and that's fine. They share the Stark name, after all. No need to be so harsh." His voice was cool and professional. "Ms. Taylor is now a talent at Stark Entertainment. She'll continue contributing to the company's success through her work there."

He turned to James. "Is it time?"

"Yes, sir. We can begin the event now," James replied promptly.

Monica approached, clipboard in hand. "Mr. Stark, Mr. Wilson,everything is ready."

Brandon nodded. "Good. Let's begin. Everyone, please take your seats."

The room shifted as everyone moved toward their assigned tables.
Brandon and the core Stark family members took their places in the front
row. I spotted Summer sitting in the third row alongside Leo and that Heather girl from Projects. Meanwhile. I was relegated to the side with the other Stark Entertainment talents, like some kind of second-class citizen.

As I sat down, I maintained a calm exterior, but inside I was seething.How *dare* Brandon treat me like this? After everything I'd done to secure my position at Stark Entertainment!

"You really stepped in it this time," Sophie whspered, leaning close."You tried to put Brandon on the spot in public, and he still let you off easy.Don't forget you're still under contract with Stark Entertainment."

I shot her a withering glare before my attention was drawn back to Summer. She was leaning toward Leo, laughing at something he'd said.*Well, well. This is interesting.* I discreetly pulled out my phone and snapped a few photos. Alexander would definitely want to see his precious ex-fiancée getting cozy with her boss.

"Who the hell was that woman, anyway?" I whispered to Sophie, still smarting from the pubic humiliation.

Sophie leaned in, her lips practically brushing my ear. "Didn't you hear what she called Brandon's parents? If I'm not mistaken, that's Elle Sinclair-some distant relative from Brandon's mother's side."

"Elle Sinclair," I repeated, the name tasting bitter on my tongue.

"Just let it go for now," Sophie advised. "Brandon didn't really take her side either. Did you notice? He doesn't seem to particularly like her."

My interest piqued. "Really? Well, then she has nothing to feel smug about either."


"Exactly," Sophie nodded. "There's no point dwelling on it. This isn't the
right time or place to make a scene. We can find another opportunity."

I nodded slightly, but my mind was already racing with possibilities for revenge.
###Chapter 217: Number 520

**Summer's POV**

Monica stepped onto the stage, her professional demeanor in full force as she tapped the microphone. The ballroom at Manhattan Club instantly hushed,all eyes drawn to the podium.

"Ladies and gentlemen of Stark Group," she began, her voice clear and confident, "welcome to our annual celebration. As we gather to recognize another remarkable year of achievements, I'd like to introduce our host for this evening."

I took a sip of my champagne, already anticipating who'd be announced.Brandon had been deliberately vague about tonight's plans, and I was starting to understand why.

"Please welcome Miss Elle Sinclair to the stage," Monica announced,stepping aside with a practiced smile.

A collective murmur swept through the crowd as Elle glided onto the stage.I nearly choked on my drink. Gone was the hysterical woman who'd confronted Brandon ín the parking garage. In her place stood the very picture of poise and elegance.

She was wearing a stunning pink mermaid gown that hugged her curves perfectly before flaring out dramatically at her knees. The dress was embellished with sequins arranged in a scale-like pattern that caught the light with her every movement, creating a dazzling effect. Her blonde hair cascaded in perfect waves down her back, and her makeup was flawless.

Elle floated across the stage like she was accepting an Oscar rather than serving as an event host. Her chin wastilted upward, her smile radiant as
she gazed adoringly at Brandon. The crowd seemed captivated by her transformation, many openly staring in appreciation.

I glanced at Brandon, curious about his reaction. He maintained his usual impassive expression, betraying no hint of being impressed by Elle's stunning appearance. His eyes rested on her briefly before shifting away,indifferent as ever.

"Good evening, everyone. I'm Elle Sinclair,"Elle introduced herself,her voice honeyed and warm.


The crowd erupted in enthusiastic applause, with a few appreciative whistles thrown in. Elle positively glowed under the attention.

"I'm sure you're all looking forward to tonight's festivities," she continued."To be honest, I'm quite excited myself..."

Next to me, Heather leaned over. "Damn, I had no idea she was so gorgeous," she whispered, clearly impressed.

"Mmm-hmm," I agreed noncommittally. Elle was undeniably beautiful when she wasn't having one of her meltdowns. The contrast between her public persona and her private behavior was jarring.

I turned to Leo, who seemed completely uninterested in Elle's beauty pageant performance. "Don't you think she's stunning?" I prodded.

Leo barely glanced up from his phone.

Then I noticed he was completely absorbed in his phone,his thumbs tapping away at the screen. Leaning slightly, I caught a glimpse of the WhatsApp interface-and the name "Scarlett" at the top of the conversation.
My jaw nearly dropped. Leo and Scarlett? My matchmaking efforts had actually worked!

Leo suddenly noticed my prying eyes and flipped his phone over, hiding the screen. "Spying isn't a particularly admirable habit," he said, though his words carried no real reproach.

"You're absolutely right," I conceded with a knowing smile. "Though I have to say, Scarlett is a wonderful woman."

A hint of color touched Leo's cheeks. "You know, conversations with overly perceptive people can be exhausting," he sighed.

"I won't pry," I promised, but couldn't help adding, "Promise!"

Inwardly, I was delighted. If Leo and Scarlett were actually hitting it off,that would be amazing. Scarlett was one of my closestfriends-reliable,kind, and genuine. And Leo, despite his strict demeanor at work, was a good man with solid principles. They might actually be perfect for each other.

My attention was drawn back to the stage as Monica returned to the microphone.

"And now, please welcomne our CEO, Mr. Brandon Stark, for the opening remarks."

The crowd broke into enthusiastic applause as Brandon rose from his seat.He moved with that effortless confidence that always made my heart skip,ascending the steps to the stage with measured strides. He walked right past Elle, completely ignoring her adoring gaze.

For a moment, his eyes swept across the crowd, searching. When his gaze finally landed on me, I felt that familiar electricity. A hint of warmth
touched his expression-imperceptible to anyone who didn't know him as well as I did, but to me it was as clear as a flashing neon sign.

"Good evening," Brandon began, his deep voice filling the room without effort. "I don't think I need to introduce myself. Today marks our annual company celebration-a time to honor achievements and welcome the new year ahead. On this special occasion, I'll keep my remarks brief. I hope everyone continues to excel. Past accomplishments are just that-past. The future depends on our collective efforts. Greater input yields greater rewards. At Stark Group, we've always valued our people. Here, you're not just seeing the present-you're seeing the future."

The crowd responded with enthusiastic applause, clearly energized by his words.

"Now," Brandon concluded, "let the evening officially begin!"

Another wave of applause swept through the ballroom as Brandon stepped back, giving the floor back to Monica.

"Thank you, Mr. Stark," Monica said, stepping forward. "As tradition dictates, we'll begin tonight's festivities with our opening dance. However,this year we're doing things a bit differently. I won't be Mr. Stark's dance partner as in previous years."

A curious murmur rippled through the crowd.

"I'm sure many of you have figured out the purpose of those number tags we distributed earlier this week," Monica continued with a smile."Gentlemen received blue lanyards, ladies received red ones. My assistant will now bring up a box containing all the ladies' numbers. Mr.Stark will draw one at random. The lucky owner of that number will have the honor of sharing the opening dance with our CEO. Quite the special perk for the
ladies of Stark Group, wouldn't you agree?"

The room erupted in excited chatter and cheers.

"Of course," Monica added, "every lady present has an equal chance-including our stars from Stark Entertainment."

I glanced toward the Stark Entertainment table. Bianca and Victoria exchanged surprised looks, clearly not having expected this twist in the evening's program.

An assistant appeared with a large clear box filled with folded red tags,setting it respectfully next to Brandon.

"Mr. Stark," Monica said, "would you please select tonight's first lucky employee?"

From around the room, female employees called out: "Pick me, Brandon!"and "Choose mine, Brandon!"

With deliberate slowness, Brandon reached into the box, his hand disappearing among the folded tags. The entire room seemed to hold its breath.


"Who would everyone like it to be?" he asked, playing to the crowd.

"Me! Me! Me!" came the chorus of hopeful responses.

Finally, Brandon withdrew his hand, holding a small red tag between his fingers. He made a show of unfolding it,examining the number before revealing it to the audience.

"Number-" he announced. "520."

I caught Elle's reaction. Her previously confident expression froze,then
crumbled into disbelief. Her legs seemed to lock in place as she stared at the number in Brandon's hand, unable to process what was happening.

Brandon's eyes sparkled with barely contained amusement."Would number 520 please step forward?"
###Chapter 218: Dancing with Brandon

**Summer's POV**

I froze, my hand automatically reaching for my purse. *520? That's my number, isn't it?* I fumbled with the clasp, frantically dgging through the contents. Lipstick, phone, keys... where was that damn tag?

The ballroom had gone completely silent. From across the room,I could see Victoria and Bianca frantically checking their own number tags,their faces falling in disappointment when they realized they weren't the lucky ones.

Suddenly,a commotion erupted near the stage. Elle Sinclair had practically lunged forward,snatching the red tag from Brandon's hand. Her face contorted in disbelief, all traces of her earlier poise vanishing in an instant.

"No..." I heard her gasp, loud enough for her voice to carry. "This isn't possible. It can't be..."

Brandon's expression remained impassive, though I detected a hint of amusement in his eyes. "What's not possible, Elle?" he asked coolly. "Is there something strange about this number?"

Elle seemed to realize her mistake, her eyes widening as she registered the crowd's stunned reaction to her outburst. "No, Brandon, I didn't mean-"she stammered, her voice rising with panic. "I just thought... I mean,I didn't expect..."

Brandon calmly reached out and took the tag back from her trembling fingers. "Monica," he called, his tone deliberately casual, "could you please identify who holds number 520?"
I finally found my tag at the bottom of my purse. Taking a deep breath, I raised my hand and stepped forward from the crowd. "I'm number 520," I called out, my voice clear and steadly. "Sorry for the delay-I was searching through my bag. I thought I'd forgotten to bring it."

All eyes turned to me as I held up the matching red tag. I was acutely aware of how different I looked from the other women in the room. My simple black dress with subtle white accents was practically austere compared to the glittering gowns and elaborate hairstyles surrounding me.

A murmur swept through the crowd as Monica stepped forward,peering at my tag. "It's Summer Taylor, Mr. Stark," she confirmed. "From the Projects department!"

Something flashed in Brandon's eyes-a warmth visible only to me before his professional mask slid back into place. His lips curved into a slight smile as he regarded me. "Miss Taylor, is it?"

I nodded, feeling hundreds of eyes on me. "Yes, Mr. Stark! Thank you for this opportunity."

"It seems Miss Taylor has excellent luck tonight," Brandon commented, his voice carrying easily through the room.

I couldn't help but smile. "I'm just fortunate, that's all."

Brandon turned slightly toward Leo, who was watching with an unreadable expression. "Schmidt, yourassistant is quite stunning, isn't she?"1


Leo cleared his throat. "Indeed, Mr. Stark."

The exchange was interrupted by a strangled sound from Elle. She was staring at me, her face drained of color. Her finger shot out, pointing
directly at me. "You... you're... Brandon,she,she-"

Brandon's eyes hardened for a fraction of a second, his gaze shifting deliberately to Jane Sinelair, who looked equally stunned. The color had drained from her face as she stared at me, her perfectly manicured hand frozen halfway to her mouth.

"Mother." Brandon said, his voice deceptively calm, "I think Elle is tired from hosting duties today. Perhaps you should escort her downstairs for a moment?"


Jane seemed to snap out of her trance, her eyes narrowing as she studied me with sudden intensity.

"No!" Elle shouted, her voice rising to a hysterical pitch. "Brandon, I'm not going anywhere! This woman is a home-wrecking slut! Brandon, have you forgotten? She betrayed you! How could you possibly-"

"That's enough!" Jane cut in sharply, grabbing Elle's arm. "Elle is indeed overtired. I'll take her to rest. As for the annual party... carry on without us!"

Brandon nodded once, then turned to James. "Have Desmond assign two men to follow them."


"Right away, sir," James replied instantly.

I stood frozen in place, so lost in thought that I didn't notice Brandon approaching until he was standing directly in front of me, one hand extended elegantly. "May I have the honor of this first dance, Miss Taylor?"he asked, his voice carrying just the right note of professional courtesy.

I hesitated, my mind still stuck on Elle's strange outburst. Was Elle taking me for somebody else?
"Miss Taylor?" Brandon prompted softly, his eyebrow arched slightly."Hmm?"

I snapped back to reality, placing my hand in his much larger one. "I'd be honored. Mr. Stark. Please lead the way."

All eyes were on us as we moved to the center of the dance floor. I couldn't help noticing the whispers-how despite our relatively simple attire compared to the others, we somehow looked like we belonged together.

The music began, a slow, elegant waltz. Brandon's hand settled at my waist. the heat of his palm burning through the thin fabric of my dress.With practiced ease, he guided me through the first steps,leading so skillfully that I felt as though I were floating.

"June," he murmured, his voice low enough that only I could hear, "what do you think of your husband's dancing skills?"

I smiled up at him, keeping my voice equally low. "Mr. Stark certainly has a talent for surprising me in the most unexpected ways. I'm absolutely delighted!"

"So you're pleased with my surprise?" he asked, his eyes searching mine.

I made a show of considering it, my lips pursed in mock seriousness."More shocked than pleased, to be honest."

"Brat," he whispered, the corner of his mouth twitching upward."I thought you'd be touched. Do you have any idea how much planning it took to make sure your number would be the one I pulled?"

"You're being incredibly obvious tonight," I pointed out, concern creeping into my voice. "After this, I'm going to be the target of every woman in this room."
"Don't worry about that," he assured me, executing a perfect turn that had us gliding across the floor. "I've already set up another distraction as a lightning rod for any potential negativity."

My eyes darted to the corner where Victoria stood watching us, her beauitiful face twisted with barely disguised hatred. "You don't mean Victoria,do you?"

"Mmm-hmm," he confirmed1, the sound rumbling deep in his chest.

"I'm not sure that worked as well as you thought," I said doubtfully. "Also,what was that weird meltdown from Elle? Did she think she is the one who dances with you?"

Brandon's arm tightened around my waist. "I promise you, Elle won't be a problem for you."

"Why?" I pressed,searching his face for answers.

"You'll understand soon enough," he said cryptically. His expression softened as he guided me through another turn. "Now focus on the dance.Stop thinking about people who don't matter."

I followed his lead, allowing my body to move in perfect synchronization with his. As the music reached its crescendo, Brandon spun me once more before dipping me gracefully in his arms, ending our performance with a flourish.


The crowd burst into applause as we held the position for a moment longer than necessary. I could feel Brandon's breath warm against my neck,his arms solid and secure around me. When he finally helped me straighten, his hand lingered at my waist.

"Miss Taylor dances beautifully," he announced to the crowd, his voice
carrying that perfect blend of professional appreciation and appropriate distance.
a ###Chapter 219: She's a Carbon Copy of Lyann

**Elle's POV**

I paced the backstage lounge at Manhattan Club like a caged animal,my sequined pink gown catching the light with each furious step. The two bodyguards Brandon had sent stood by the door like statues, watching my every move.

"How the hell did this happen?" I muttered, tugging at my pearl necklace.
"It was supposed to be∗me∗!′′

Jane sat on the edge of a velvet settee, her manicured nails tapping rhythmically against her clutch. She hadn't said much since Brandon humiliated us in front of the entire company.

"Elle, sit down," she finally said, her voice tight. "Stop pacing. You're making me dizzy."

I ignored her, continuing to circle the room. The image of Summer dancing with Brandon kept flashing through my mind, making me physically ill.

"Aunt Jane," I whispered, my voice trembling, "what are we going to do?She... do you think Brandon did that on purpose? How could he not know that Summer looks *exactly* like Lyanna? And he's been callingher to his office repeatedly.*His office*."

Jane's head snapped up, her eyes widening. "What did you say? Brandon already knew about this Summer? And he knew she looks like Lyanna?"

"What else could it be?" I demanded, my fingers twisting together in my lap. "I've been wondering why he keeps calling her to his office. And even
though I hadn't seen her before, something about her silhouette felt so familiar. Now I know why-she's a carbon copy of Lyanna! Do you think Brandon might be..."

"Impossible," Jane cut in firmly. "Even if she looks like Lyanna, they're not the same person. And don't forget how Lyanna left Brandon, how she left New York. What does Brandon hate most in this world? It's the reason he still hasn't forgiven me after all these years. He has no feelings left for Lyanna, and he certainly couldn't have feelings for this Summer."

"But Jane," I said, my voice rising with panic, "I hate her.I really,*really*hate her. Just thinking about her walking around with Lyanna's face makes me feel sick. Jane, you have to get rid of her."

Jane's eyes hardened. "I'll figure something out. One way or another,this woman must go!"

My gaze drifted to the bodyguards still watching us. Their presence suddenly felt suffocating.

"You two, come here," I called out, adopting my most authoritative tone."Brandon only told you to protect me, not to stare at me all night like I'm some kind of prisoner."

The taller guard-Desmond-didn't move. "Miss Sinclair, Mr. Wilson's instructions were very clear. We are to stay with you and Mrs. Sinclair at all times. Please don't make our job more difficult."

Jane turned to the bodyguards, her voice dropping to that silky, dangerous tone. "Gentlemen, I am Brandon's mother. You do know who I am,don't you? Then you should also know that crossing me would be... unwise for your careers."
"Mrs. Sinclair, with all due respect," Desmond replied calmly, "we're simply following orders. Mr. Stark pays our salary, and we only answer to him."

Jane's eyes narrowed dangerously before her lips curved into a cold smile. "Very well. I won't make things difficult for you. But I would like some tea.



Desmond nodded,clearly relieved. "T'll have someone bring it right away."

"Wait," I called after him. "I need to see someone. Brandon's secretary,Monica. Bring her here. And the person who prepared the drawing box for tonight-bring them too!"

Minutes later, Monica appeared in the doorway,followed by a nervous-looking staff member.

"Miss Sinclair," she said politely, "you asked to see me?"

Rage exploded inside me. Without thinking, I crossed the room and slapped her hard across the face.

Monica staggered back, her hand flying to her cheek. "Miss Sinclair!" she gasped, "What have I done to deserve this? Weren't you just telling me the other day that we're friends?"

"Friends?" I laughed harshly."With*you*? If you weren't Brandon's secretary, I wouldn't give you the time of day!"

"I guess I misjudged you completely, Miss Sinclair," Monica replied, her expression hardening.

"Like I care what you think," I sneered. "Did you really believe there was any genuine feeling between us? Haven't I given you enough perks
already?"

"Indeed," Monica replied tightly. "So why exactly did you summon me here? Found out I'm no longer useful, so you thought you'd kick me to the curb with a slap for good measure?"

"Stop playing dumb!" I spat. "Tell me the truth-did you switch the drawing box?"

My hand flew up to slap her again, but this time Monica caught my wrist mid-air.

"Miss Sinclair," she said, her voice dangerously soft, "You've already slapped me once-do youreally want to try for a second time?"

"Are you threatening me?" I hissed. "Let me tell you something-even if something *unfortunate* were to happen to you, Brandon wouldn't care.You're just a secretary. Your life means nothing."

Monica smiled,sending a chill down my spine. "I don't understand what you're talking about, Miss Sinclair. The drawing box was prepared early this morning. Why would I need to switch anything? Unless... there's some secret about the box that I don't know about? A secret that *you*know,perhaps?"

"That's ridiculous! I don't know anything!"

Monica turned to Jane. "Miss Sinclair has physically assaulted me without provocation. I may be just a secretary, but I am Mr. Stark's personally appointed chief secretary.Would you care to comment?"

I saw realization dawn in Jane's eyes-she'd figured out what I'd done.I'd switched the tags in the drawing box, but someone had switched them back.
"Jane," I pleaded desperately, "say something! You're a member of the Stark family, the mother of the CEO! Are you going to let a mere secretary intimidate you?"

When Jane remained silent, my panic escalated. "Jane, please! Help me!I can't stand the sight of this woman. Tell Brandon-tell your brother to get rid of her. I never want to see her again!"

"Enough!" Jane finally snapped. "When will you stop this nonsense?"

Monica's lips curled into a knowing smirk.

"What do you want?" Jane demanded, turning to Monica.

"I don't want anything," Monica replied innocently. "Tve been gone far too long already-the main event of the annual party is about to begin. If I'm not there, Mr. Stark will wonder where I am, and the entire Stark Group will know that Mrs. Sinclair-”

"Get out!" Jane interrupted, her face flushed with anger. "Get out right now!



"Thank you, Mrs. Sinclair," Monica replied with a slight bow, not hiding her triumphant expression as she left.

"How could you let her leave like that?" I turned on Jane. "She's clearly behind this! She's deliberately working against me! If it weren't for her,I would have been dancing with Brandon tonight, not that woman!"

"Enough!" Jane hissed, grabbing my arm. I stared at her, shocked by her anger.


"Don't you understand?" Jane continued, lowering her voice. "Monica wouldn't dare act this way unless she had Brandon's backing. Which
means Brandon likely knows about what you did with the drawing box."

"That's not possible..."

"I warned you to be nice to Monica, didn't I? Besides James,she's the person Brandon trusts most. Do you think she became chief secretary at her age by being naive? And now you've made an enemy of her. What were you thinking?"
###Chapter 220: Your Voice Is Pure Garbage

**Summer's POV**

"Miss Taylor dances beautifully," Brandon announced to the crowd, his voice projecting that perfect blend of appreciation and appropriate distance.

I dipped into a small curtsy. "Thank you for the honor, Mr. Stark," I replied, my voice steady despite the butterflies in my stomach.

Brandon's eyes lingered on me for just a second too long before he stepped back. I retreated toward my table, acutely aware of hundreds of eyes tracking my every move.

Heather practically pounced the moment I sat down.

"Oh my God, Summer!" she squealed, grabbing my arm. "I had no idea your luck was *this* good! So,spill-what was it like? How did it feel dancing with the CEO?"

"Just like any other dance," I replied with a shrug. "Mr. Stark is a good dancer. That's pretty much it."

"That's *it*?" Heather's voice shot up several decibels, drawing curious glances. "Are you kidding me right now?"

I slapped my hand over her mouth. "Jesus, Heather, keep it down! Haven't you noticed I'm basically public enemy number one right now?"

Her eyes widened above my fingers, and I slowly removed my hand.

"Sorry," she whispered. "But seriously, your heart didn't race even a little bit? We're talking about Brandon freaking Stark here-the guy half the women in this room would kill to spend five minutes with. Are you
seriously telling me you felt *nothing*?"

"Right now, the main thing I'm feeling is that if looks could kill, I'd be dead," I muttered, painfully aware of the daggers being glared in my direction from women throughout the ballroom.

Heather followed my gaze, her eyes landing on Victoria.

"Wait a second," she said, her forehead crinkling. "Taylor... Taylor..." She glanced between Victoria and me. "That's not exactly a common surname.Please don't tell me you're related to her?"

"You finally caught on, huh?" I replied dryly.

"Oh my God," Heather gasped. "Victoria Taylor is like, a legit star now!I just googled her-she's the Taylor family's eldest daughter! So that means you're..."


"Yep," I confirmed. "She's my sister."

"Holy shit!" Heather's jaw practically hit the table. "Why didn't you ever mention this?"

I shrugged uncomfortably. "It never really came up. Besides, we're not exactly close."


Thankfully, the lights dimmed before Heather could interrogate me further.Monica returned to the sage, "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our first performer of the evening. From Stark Entertainment,Cleo!"

The crowd applauded as Cleo took the stage. Her dance performance was energetic and well-executed, drawing enthusiastic cheers from the audience.
As she finished with a dramatic pose, I noticed Victoria waiting in the wings,clearly preparing for her turn.
Bianca was scheduled to perform second-to-last. Her classical music piece was supposedly the highlight of the entertainment portion. Victoria,being newer to Stark Entertainment, had been slotted in the last part of the program.

When it was Victoria's turn, she floated onto the stage in her designer gown, flashing a dazzling smile.

"First. I'd like to wish Stark Group continued success and prosperity," she began smoothly. "I only joined Stark Entertainment recently,and I'm incredibly grateful to Mr. Stark for this opportunity."

Her eyes found Brandon in the crowd, her smile turning shy and coy.I fought the urge to roll my eyes.

"I promise to work hard and become a source of pride for both Stark Entertainment and Stark Group," she continued. "Tonight, I'll be performing 'There You'H Be' by Faith Hill. I hope this song reminds everyone that there are people who support us through all challenges."

The music started, and Victoria began to sing. Her voice was... fine. Not terrible, but definitely not spectacular either. It was clear singing wasn't her strongest talent.

Just as Victoria was building up to the chorus, a commotion erupted near the entrance. Elle Sinclair had returned, her face flushed with anger as she spotted Victoria singing to Brandon with batting eyelashes.

Without warning, Elle marched toward the stage, snatched the microphone from the MC's hand, and interrupted Victoria mid-high-note.

"Ms. Taylor's singing is absolutely terrible," Elle announced loudly,snatching the microphone, "Your voice is pure garbage. You1 should stick
to acting because clearly, singing isn't your thing."

The music screeched to a halt. Victoria stood frozen, her expressioncycling through shock, embarrassment, and finally settling on wounded dignity.

"I'm sorry, Miss Sinclair." Victoria said, her voice trembling. "What exactly do you mean?"

Employees whispered among themselves.

"Who gave you the courage to stand up here?" Elle continued,oblivious to the whispering. "Don't think being signed to Stark Entertainment makes you special. Who put you on this stage when you clearly lack talent?"

Victoria's eyes welled up with perfectly timed tears. She turned toward Brandon, her expression heartbreakingly vulnerable.

"Mr. Stark," she said, voice quavering. "You invited me here tonight-was it just to humiliate me like this?"

Brandon's jaw tightened as he rose from his seat. "James, please escort Elle out."

"Brandon!" Elle shrieked, her composure shattering. "What are you saying?How could you treat me this way? Brandon, have you changed your heart? Is it because of this Victoria-"

"Mother," Brandon cut her off coldly, turning to Jane Sinclair. "You brought her here. Handle this."

Jane quickly stepped forward,embarrassed.

Security moved in, escorting a still-shouting Elle toward the exit. Jane followed,her earlier confidence replaced by mortification.
The ballroom fell into uncomfortable silence. Brandon stood,straightening his tie as he approached the stage. The crowd collectively held its breath.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Brandon announced commandingly. "I'd like to make ana announcement that was scheduled for later this evening,but perhaps now is the appropriate time."

He paused, surveying the room with that authoritative gaze that always made my stomach flip.


"Regarding our Diana brand," he continued, "we've been searching for a new spokesperson-considering celebrities both domestic and international.



Victoria's posture straightened, her earlier distress suddenly forgotten.

"After careful consideration," Brandon said, "I've decided that Diana's new spokesperson will be Miss Victoria Taylor."

Victoria's hand flew to her mouth, her eyes widening in genuine shock."Mr. Stark," she gasped, "is this true? Am I really Diana's new spokesperson?"

"Of course," Brandon replied smoothly. "I never go back on my word.Starting today, Miss Victoria Taylor is Diana's North American representative."

From the corner of my eye, I caught Bianca's reaction-her face drained of color, her hands gripping the edge of her chair so tightly her knuckles turned white.

"What?" she said, her voice breaking. "How could it be Victoria?"
###Chapter 221: Are You Jealous, Summer?

**Brandon's POV**

"Mr. Stark," Victoria gushed, "thank you so much for this incredible opportunity. I promise I'Il cherish being Diana's spokesperson and make you proud."


I clasped her hand briefly, feeling the camera flashes capture the moment.Exactly as planned. I withdrew my hand almost immediately, discreetly wiping it against my pants when she wasn't looking.

"We'll see," I replied coolly. Her eyes registered the subtle dismissal, but her smile never faltered.

"Absolutely," she nodded, taking a step back. "I won't let you down."

I turned to Monica, who stood nearby awaiting instructions. "Let's keep the event moving. What's next?"

"Mr. Stark, now we have the prize drawing!" Monica announced with professional enthusiasm. "And we need you to select the winner!"

"What prize?" I asked, though I already knew the answer.

"This year's grand prize, sir." Monica's eyes sparkled with excitement.The crowd seemed to hold its collective breath.

I approached the stage once more, reaching into the box of blue tags Monica presented. I made a show of mixing them thoroughly before selecting one.

"And the winning number is..." I unfolded the tag, holding it up."Number 127,blue tag. Who has this number?"
From the Projects department table, Leo Schmidt rose to his feet,looking genuinely surprised. I suppressed a smile. Everything was falling into place.

"Congratulations to Director Schmidt from Projects," I announced. "Monica,what exactly has he won?"

"A car, Mr. Stark," Monica replied. "Director Schmidt, congratulations on your good fortune! Please see me after the event to claim your prize."

Leo nodded formally. "It's Mr. Stark's generosity. Thank you."

As I returned to my seat, I caught snippets of conversation from the Projects table.

"Leo, you hit the jackpot!" Heather was practically bouncing in her seat. "I heard it's a Range Rover-worth several hundred thousand at least!"

Leo's expression remained neutral. "Is that so?"

"Aren't you excited at all?" Heather pressed.

"I am," Leo replied flatly. "Can't you tell how thrilled I am?"

I suppressed a smirk. Leo's perpetual poker face was something I'd always appreciated about him.

The rest of the evening proceeded according to schedule. Bianca performed her dance number flawlessly, though the light had gone out of her eyes. The Diana spokesperson position had clearly been something she'd coveted. I made a mental note to have James arrange some form of compensation for her later.

By midnight, the event was winding down. Most guests had filtered out,
Tamily members. Robert, Gavin,and Meave lingered near the exit, waiting to bid me goodnight.

"Brandon," my father began as I approached,his voice heavy with concern "this situation with Elle will certainly reach your grandfather William's ears. And that young woman,Summer-"

"What about her?" I cut in. "Summer performed excellently tonight,and her work in Projects has been exceptional. Even Leo, who's notoriously critical, speaks highly of her abilities."

Robert's eyes narrowed. "You know perfectly well that's not what I'm referring to. Didn't you see your mother's reaction? Elle's? The girl bears a striking resemblance to Lyanna..."

"Father, you're overthinking this," I replied firmly. "She is Summer, and Lyanna is Lyanna. I can distinguish between them perfectly well. It's getting late-perhaps you should all head home."

Gavin stepped forward, placing a hand on Robert's shoulder. "He's right,Robert. Brandon is a grown man in his thirties, not a child. He's capable of making his own decisions in these matters."

Robert sighed heavily. "Fine, fine. I'll say no more. But remember,regardless of whatever is or isn't happening between you and this Summer girl, your mother and Elle now know of her existence. They won't let this go. I can't guarantee they won't target this innocent young woman."

"You seem unusually concerned, Father," I observed, my tone softening slightly. "Rest assured, I have everything under control."

"If you say so," Robert conceded. "Just remember,whatever your mother might do, she's still your mother."
"I'm aware," I replied coolly. "As long as they don't cross certain lines,I won't need to intervene."

After my family finally departed, I pulled out my phone and texted Summer.

*Where are you?*

Her reply came almost instantly: *Backstage with Leo and the others.Heather insisted on seeing Leo's new ear. Did your father and uncle leave?*

*Yes,* I replied simply, then decided to call her instead.

"I'm almost finished here," I said when she answered. "Let's head home together,alright?"

There was a brief pause on the other end. "I don't think that's a good idea.Your car is too recognizable, and I've already attracted enough attention tonight."

"So what do you propose?" I asked, allowing a hint of disappointment to creep into my voice. "You're not abandoning me, are you, Summer?"

"Don't use that pouty tone with me," she laughed. "I never said I was abandoning you. I just think we should leave separately. Besides, we both drove here. Just be good,okay?"

"Fine," I relented. "If you insist."

After ending the call, I turned to find James waiting nearby.

"Everything's nearly ready, sir," he reported. "Tomorrow, we should see some news about you and Victoria. Would you like to select which photo to use?"
He presented his tablet, displaying several options from tonight's event.I pointed to one showing Victoria and me shaking hands, her expression adoring while mine remained professionally neutral.

"This one," I decided, then indicated another image-a particularly unflattering shot of Elle's meltdown. "Include this one too."

James hesitated. "Sir, I'm not sure I understand. This approach puts your reputation at risk. Is it worth it?"

"It's the fastest solution," I explained. "I'm done waiting. Make sure these run tonight-I want to see them on the front page by morning.
Washington should receive them too."

"Yes, sir. I'll handle it immediately."




In the parking garage, I texted Summer again, suggesting we could at least drive home together in a convoy. She agreed.

I drove out first and called her on speakerphone, letting the conversation flow between our separate vehicles. Soft music played in the background-a haunting melody called "Liekkas."

"I didn't know you listened to this kind of music," Summer remarked, her voice warm through the speaker.

"Monica downloaded it," I replied. "I find it pleasant. Summer, do you realize what we're doing right now?"

"What do you mean?"

"This cloak-and-dagger routine. We're husband and wife, yet we're
sneaking around. When are you going to make me official?"

She laughed. "You make it sound like I'm the one holding back. If you want, we could announce it tomorrow. Then I can tell your parents that you're Summer Taylor's husband, and they should stop arranging blind dates or fiancées for you."

I couldn't help smiling at the possessive tone in her voice. "Mrs. Stark.could you possibly be jealous? Of Elle, perhaps?"

"Absolutely not!" she protested too quickly. "I just think that as your lawfully wedded wife, it's strange that your parents keep arranging matches for you. What does that make me?"

"So my wife is jealous after all," I said, feeling surprisingly pleased.

"You'reenjoying this way too much," she muttered.

I was about to respond when something in the rearview mirror caught my attention. A car had been following us for the past few miles, maintaining the exact same distance regardless of how I adjusted my speed.

I narrowed my eyes, scanning the road ahead while keeping the follower in my peripheral vision. June was still talking, completely unaware of the potential danger.

"June," I said, cutting her off mid-sentence, "don't follow me. Take the next turn onto River Road."

"What? Why? What's going on?"
###Chapter 222: Danger

**Brandon's POV**

I didn't answer, instead accelerating suddenly. When I glanced at my rearview mirror again. I could see the following car accelerating too.completely abandoning any pretense of casual driving.

"Brandon!" June's panicked voice came through the car speakers."Where are you? What's happening? Answer me!"

"I'm fine." I replied, keeping my voice deliberately calm. "June, listen to me.
Turn at the nextintersection. Head to River Road and call Ethan immediately."

"Brandon-"

"Now. June." I ended the call before she could protest further.

I floored the accelerator, pushing the car to its limits. The vehicle behind matched my speed. I made a sharp turn, switching lanes abruptly. The tail followed without hesitation, executing the maneuver with professional precision.


I grabbed my phone and speed-dialed Edward.

"Edward, track my location now," I said the moment he answered. "I've got a tail. Someone's following me. Have Landon hack into the traffic cameras along my route and identify who's in the car."

"On it," Edward replied immediately. "Where's Summer?"

"I sent her in another direction. She should be safe."
A few tense minutes passed as I continued leading the tail away from June's route, taking increasingly complex turns.

"Got them," Edward finally said. "Sending you the intel now."

My phone pinged with an incoming file. I glanced at it quickly between maneuvers.

"Mexican operatives," Edward continued. "Brandon, who did you piss off?Wasn't today the annual party?"

"Can you get someone to me in time?" I cut him off, swerving to avoid an oncoming truck.

"Not likely," Edward admitted. "I've got your position on satellite. Three people in the vehicle-two men, one woman. They're armed. Can you handle it?"

"I'm going to have to, just tell me the best place to end this," I said. "I need somewhere isolated."

"Five hundred meters ahead, make a right, then another right. It'll put you on a one-way road leading to the highway. There's an abandoned construction site-perfect place to make your stand."

I nodded to myself. "What about June? Is she safe?"

"I've told Sean to find her," Edward assured me. "Did you tell her to contact Ethan?"

"Yes. If you and Sean can get there in time, I'll wait for you."

Edward's voice came through my phone later again, his tone suddenly urgent. "Brandon, where's Summer right now?"
"River Road. She should be calling Ethan by now," I replied. "Why?"

"I've tapped into their communications," Edward said. "They have an ambush set up on your usual route home. They seem to know your routine intimately."

My blood ran cold. "Which means they know about-"

"Your marriage," Edward finished grimly. "They must know Summer's your wife."

"Fuck. June's in danger. Tell Sean and Ethan to find her!"

Summer's POV

I stared at my phone in dismay. Brandon had hung up on me, and when I tried to call back, all I got was a busy signal. Something was very wrong.

Movement in my rearview mirror caught my attention. A dark sedan was gaining on me rapidly, showing no signs of slowing down. My heart hammered as I stomped on the accelerator, taking the turn toward River Road at dangerous speed.

The car behind me matched my pace effortlessly.

With shaking hands, I fumbled for my phone until I found Ethan's number.

"Ethan, it's Summer," I said, my voice quivering. "I need help."

"What's happened? Where's Brandon?"

"We were driving home when Brandon suddenly told me to take a different route. He saidI someone was following us. He's gone now, but there's a car following me too. Brandon told me to call vou."
"Where are you now?" Ethan demanded.

"Heading toward River Road. What should I do?"

"Keep driving around that area," Ethan instructed. "I'm coming to you.Don't hang up-I need to track your location."

I heard a woman's voice in the background asking if she could help.

"Go back inside," Ethan snapped. "This isn't your concern."

"But I could help!" the woman insisted.

"I said no!" Ethan's voice had never sounded so harsh. "Track Summer's position and keep updating me. That's how you can help."

Meanwhile, I was speeding along River Road, the pursuing car still locked on my tail. I drove in circles, trying to buy time.

I gripped the wheel tighter, my entire body tense as I saw the car speeding up in my mirror, preparing to ram me. Just as I braced for impact, another vehicle came tearing across my field of vision, slamming directly into my pursuer.

The sound of metal crushing metal filled the air. I hit the gas hard.putting as much distance as possible between me and the wreckage before finally stopping.

Heart pounding, I looked back. The car that had been following me was completely mangled, crushed beneath the vehicle that had intercepted it.A tall figure in a long black coatstepped out and effortlessly took down both men who had crawled from the wreckage.

I remembered what Sean had once told me: *"Two Brandons combined
couldn't take Ethan in a fight."* Now I understood.

I got out of my car, running toward Ethan on shaky legs.

"Ethan," I gasped, "I... they... Brandon-is Brandon okay?"

Ethan's eyes flicked toward me briefly. "Brandon can handle himself," he assured me. "Few people can match his skills. He'll be fine."

Ethan crouched down, his narrow eyes cold as he addressed the downed men. "You can tell me what I want to know voluntarily, or I can persuade you."

One of the men spat blood. "Kill me if you want. You'll get nothing from me. We sent our best assassin after Stark. He won't survive."

"You sure?" Ethan's eyebrow arched, and without warning,his hand moved in a blur. There was a sickening crack as he twisted the man's neck.He turned to the second man. "I have no interest in things that have no value.What do you think?"

The remaining man's eyes bulged with terror. "I'll talk! We take orders from you American-they paid to have Brandon Stark killed. The woman-they just wanted her captured alive."

"Good," Ethan nodded, then twisted this man's neck too with the same frightening casualness.

I stumbled backward, my stomach lurching as I realized what I'd just witnessed. Ethan had killed both men without hesitation.

Ethan stood, pulling a handkerchief from his coat pocket and methodically wiping his hands. He looked at my pale face.
"Scared?" he asked mildly.

"Ethan.," I whispered, my voice shaking, "they were human beinge.How could you just-"
"They are Mexicans." Ethan cut me off, his voice devold of emotion."Probably illegals. No one will miss them." He tucked the handkerchief away. "Besides, they were trying to kill you and Brandon. I don't nee why they deserved to live."
###Chapter 223: Between Life And Death

**Summer's POV**

"But..." I finally managed, my voice barely above a whisper. I wanted to say more, to question what had just happened, but the words died on my lips as Ethan's cold, impassive eyes met mine.

"Sorry, did I frighten you?" he asked, his tone conversational, as if asking about the weather.

I swallowed hard, finding my voice again. "Ethan, I know you were trying to save me, but killing people for me? I just... what about them?" I gestured frantically at the bodies, then at the buildings around us. "The security cameras must have caught everything. Ethan, you-"

"Don't worry about it," he cut me off smoothly. "Someone will take care of this."

I stared at him in disbelief. Take care of this? Two men were dead! You couldn't just "take care of" something like that!

"But-" I started again, only to be silenced by the sharp ring of Ethan's phone.

He answered immediately, his posture shifting subtly as he listened.I couldn't hear the other side of the conversation, but I could tell from his expression that something important was happening.

"Understood," he said finally, then hung up and turned to me. "That was Arya. The security footage from this area has been erased, but we need to leave immediately.Someone will be here shortly to clean up." He paused,his eyes darkening. "There's an ambush set up on the road to Brandon's
place.Someone wants him dead. We can't go there now."

My heart clenched painfully. Brandon.

"I understand," I said, my voice steadier than I felt. "Let's go."

As we headed toward Ethan's car, I couldn't help looking back at the bodies one last time. "Are you sure? Ethan, please don't lie to me."

"I promise you," he replied, his tone softening slightly. "Now get in the car.



Inside Ethan's sleek vehicle, I tried to calm my racing thoughts. The leather seats were cold against my bare arms. and I shivered-though whether from the temperature or from shock. I couldn't tell.

"The road to the Hamptons estate is compromised," Ethan informed me as he pulled away from the curb. "You can't go back there until we're sure it's safe."

"But..." I gripped the edge of my seat, anxiety climbing up my throat."What about Brandon? Where is he? Ethan,do you know where he is? Is he safe?"

"Don't worry," Ethan replied, his eyes fixed on the road. "With Brandon's skills, very few people can defeat him."

"Are they Mexican mercenaries?" I pressed, remembering the dying man's words. "Why would they do that? What's their connection to Brandon?"

"I'm not entirely sure myself," Ethan admitted. "You can ask Brandon when he returns. For now, I'll take you to my place. Brandon has an apartment in Manhattan as well."
"But Jean-Pierre is staying there now," I reminded him. "Ethan, I'm fine,you can take me to-"

"Then we'll go to my place or Dr. Sean's," Ethan interrupted firmly. "Brandon entrusted you to me, and I won't let anything happen to you."

Brandon's POV

I pulled my car to a stop outside the abandoned factory, cutting the engine but leaving the keys in the ignition. Through the silence of the night,I could hear three sets of footsteps approaching-two heavier ones flanking a lighter, more measured tread. The woman was in the middle, then.

I reached slowly into my glove compartment, extracting my handgun and checking the magazine. Six bullets. Not ideal, but it would have to do. I had a knife strapped to my ankle as backup.

As I slid out of the car, I noticed a small puddle of oil beneath a nearby generator.Perfect.

The three assassins emerged from the shadows-two muscular men and a wiry woman, all dressed in tactical gear, all heavily armed. Their movements spoke of professional training, not ordinary hitmen. The woman gestured, and the men spread out, attempting to flank mne.

I reached into my pocket, pulled out my lighter, and flicked it open. The assassins tensed, weapons trained on me.

"Brandon Stark," the woman called, her accent thick. "Our business is not persona1.Just unfortunate for you."

"Is that so?" I replied calmly, then flicked the lighter into the oil puddle.

The small explosion that followed wasn't lethal, but it was disorienting-
exactly what I needed. In the momentary confusion, I rolled toward the nearest concrete barrier, firing two quick shots. The first assassin dropped.a clean headshot. The second man stumbled, hit inthe shoulder,but managed to return fire.

I ducked, bullets ricocheting off concrete, and waited for a break in his shooting.Four bullets left. I fired twice more, and he collapsed.

The woman was smarter, keeping her distance and conserving ammunition.I fired my remaining bullets in her direction, forcing her to take cover,then tossed the empty gun aside.

"You're out of bullets," she called, triumph in her voice. "Today, one of us dies. You killed my brothers, and I'll avenge them!"

"Really?" I replied, keeping my voice level as I spotted her position through my phone's connection with Edward's satellite feed. "If you hadn't come to kill me, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to kill them. Before I die, at least tell me who's paying for my death. Let me die knowing."

She laughed harshly. "Letting you know wouldn't hurt. The person who wants you dead is American, paying top dollar for your head. Don't blame us-no one turns down that kind of money."

"A name!" I demanded, positioning myself for the final confrontation. "I don't have time for this."

"Doesn't matter," she sneered, stepping forward with her weapon raised."You'll be dead in-"

I launched myself at her, using the shadows for cover, my military-grade combat knife finding her throat before she could react. Her eyes widened in genuine surprise, and then she was gone.
I stood, wiping the blade clean, when a slow clapping echoed through the abandoned space.

"Come out." I called, already knowing who it was.

Dr. Sean emerged from behind a rusted shipping container, his usual grin firmly in place. "Well, well! I have to say, Brandon, that's pretty inconsiderate of you. Your brother rushes all the way out here to save you,and you've already handled everything yourself. Why'd you even call me ovet? To waste my time?"

"You're just arriving now?" I asked dryly.

"Of course! Do you have any idea how hard this place was to find?" Sean complained, picking his way carefully around the bodies. "And seriously,who chooses an abandoned factory in the middle of nowhere? By the way,who the hell did you piss off recently?"

"Edward said there's an ambush at my house," I cut in, not bothering to answer his question.

"Yeah, I called James. He and Desmond are already headed there," Sean confirmed."Edward's coordinating everything."

"What about June?" I asked, the only question that truly mattered.

Sean rolled his eyes dramatically. "Relax, you don't you trust Ethan? Those assassins wouldn't stand a chance against him. He just called and said he's taking your wife to my place since your house is compromised."

Relief washed through me. June was safe. That was all that mattered.

Without another word, I headed for my car.
"Hey, hey,hey! Brandon, you ungrateful bastard!" Sean called after me. "I rush all the way here to save you, and you're just leaving? Brandon!"

As I pulled away, I could hear him still shouting in the rearview mirror."God damn! Now I'm stuck cleaning up these bodies for free!"
###Chapter 224: I Can't Lose You

**Summer's POV**

The moment Ethan closed the guest roomdoor behind me,my legs finally gave out. I collapsed to the floor, my whole body trembling uncontrollably as the adrenaline drained from my system. Those men were dead. Ethan had killed them without hesitation, snapped their necks like it was nothing.And somewhere out there, Brandon was facing the same kind of danger.

The tears I'd been holding back spilled over, my breath coming in short,desperate gasps. My hands wouldn't stop shaking. I wrapped my arms around myself, rocking slightly, trying to pull myself together.

A soft knock on the door made me jump.

"Summer?" Arya's gentle voice called before she pushed the door open.When she spotted me on the floor, her eyes widened in alarm. She rushed over,crouching beside me.

"Summer, are you okay?" she asked, her hand on my shoulder. "Are you hurt? Should I get Dr. Sean for you?"

I quickly wiped at my face, embarrassed to be caught in such a state. "No,I'm fine," I insisted, voice trembling despite my best efforts. "Just... tired.Please don't tell Ethan. I don't need a doctor."

Arya's eyes were full of concern as she helped me to my feet. I wobbled slightly,steadying myself against the bed.

"I just..." I looked down at my clothes, still the same outfit from the party,now rumpled and stained from the night's events. I needed to wash away this night, needed to feel clean again. "Arya, couldI borrow some clothes?
I'd really like to take a shower."

"Of course," she nodded immediately. "The bathroom's right through there.I'll grab you something to wear. Fair warning though-my style might not be exactly your taste."

"Anything's fine," I assured her, already moving toward the bathroom."Thank you."

The guest bathroom was ridiculously luxurious-all marble and chrome with a shower big enough for four people. I caught sight of myself in the mirror and barely recognized the wild-eyed woman staring back.I braced myself against the sink, staring at my trembling hands.

"Get it together, Summer," I whispered to my reflection. "You're okay.Everything's going to be okay."

Rationally, I understood why Ethan had done what he did. Those men were trying to kill us. They were professional assassins. But watching him end their lives so effortlessly, so casually... it was like nothing I'd ever seen outside of movies.

A soft knock interrupted my thoughts.

"Summer?" Arya called. "I've got some clothes for you. Can I come in?"

"Yeah, come in," I answered, quickly wiping my face again.

Arya slipped in with a neatly folded stack of clothes-a simple t-shirt,yoga pants, and even a set of underwear with the tags still on.

"The underwear's new," she explained quickly, seeing my surprise."Never worn,I promise."
"Thank you," I said sincerely. "This is perfect."

After she left. I turned the shower to the hottest setting I could stand.I stepped under the scalding spray, letting it pound against my skin.washing away the night. I scrubbed every inch of my body, as if I could somehow cleanse myself of the memory of those men's deaths. By the time I finally turned off the water, my skin was pink and raw, but I felt marginally more human.

I toweled off and slipped into Arya's borrowed clothes. The pants were a bit short on me, but otherwise everything fit well enough. I combed through may wet hair with my fingers and steeled myself to face whatever came next.

When I opened the bathroom door, my heart nearly stopped.

Brandon stood in the middle of the guest room, still in his suit from the party though it was now rumpled and-was that blood on his sleeve?

"Brandon," I whispered, hardly daring to believe he was really there.

"Hey," he replied softly, his eyes drinking me in like a man dying of thirst.

I didn't think-just launched myself across the room and into his arms.He caught me easily, his strong arms wrapping around me so tightly I could barely breathe. I didn't care. I buried my face in his neck, inhaling his familiar scent, my hands frantically exploring his back, his shoulders,his face-making sure he was really whole, really unharmed.

"Brandon," I breathed against his lips before crushing my mouth to his.

"Mmm," he hummed in agreement, kissing me back with equal desperation.
When we fnally broke apart, both breathing hard, I couldn't help myself I punched his chest.
"You idiot!" I choked ouat, tears threatening again. "Do you have any idea how worried I was? How could you just ditch me like that? What if something had happened to you? What would I do then? You can't just...you can't just handle everything by yourself!"

Brandon's expression softened. He cupped my face in his hands,thumbs gently wiping away the tears that had escaped.

"I'm fine," he murmured. "Look at me-not a scratch. I knew I could handle it, that's why I sent you to safety first."
"But what if you couldn't?" I insisted, clutching the front of his shirt. "I can't lose you, Brandon. I can't. Don't you get that? I don't want to be protected if it means you putting yourself in danger."

"Shh," he soothed, pressing his forehead to mine. "I'm sorry. I promise I won't leave you behind again,okay?"

"You better not," I sniffled, my anger already fading in the face of the overwhelming relief that he was alive, he was here, he was safe.

Brandon guided me to the bed, sitting down and pulling me onto his lap.I curled against him, my head tucked under his chin, his heartbeat strong and steady beneath my ear.

"It's over now," he said, his hand stroking my damp hair. "Ethan did what he had to do to protect you. Those men weren't American citizens-they entered the country illegally. And they were killers, Summer.Professiona hitmen wanted internationally."
I shuddered, remembering their cold eves i.-.-.
thing when he saved me. But why? Why would anyone want to kill you?Or me?"

Brandon's arms tightened around me. "Don't worry about that right now. I'll handle it."

"How can I not worry?" I pulled backto look at him incredulously."Someone literally sent *assassins* to kill you, Brandon! What if they try again?"

"They won't," he said with quiet confidence. "Not right away,at least.I'll talk to Ethan and the others, make sure we have a plan. Are you tired?"

The question seemed absurd given everything that had happened, but as soon as he mentioned it, exhaustion crashed over mne like a wave. It was well past 3 AM, and the emotional rollercoaster of the nighthad drained what little energy I had left.

"Yeah." I admitted. "Really tired."

"Then sleep," Brandon murmured, shifting us both to lie down properly.He kept his arms around me, one hand gently stroking my back in soothing circles. "I'll be right here."
"Don't leave," I mumbled, already feeling sleep pulling at me.

"I won't," he promised, pressing a kiss to my forehead.

I drifted off to the steady rhythm of his breathing, the solid warmth of his body next to mine the only security I needed.
###Chapter 225: Who's Behind This?

**Brandon's POV**

I waited until Summer's breathing deepened and her body went completely limp against mine before carefully extracting myself from her grip. She stirred slightly but didn't wake, her face finally peaceful in sleep.

I stood for a moment, just watching her. The knowledge that someone had targeted her-wanted her captured alive-made my blood run cold. This wasn't random. This was personal, and I intended to find out exactly who was behind it.

I slipped silently from the room, making my way downstairs to where I knew the others would be waiting. The grand living room of Ethan's Manhattan residence was dimly lit, Sean lounging on one of the sofas while Edward and Ethan stood near the windows, deep in conversation.

"Well, look who finally decided to join us," Sean drawled when he spotted me. "You know, some of us have been up all night dealing with your mess while you were upstairs comforting your wife. Talk about priorities."

"Sean," I replied evenly, "I don't recall asking for your opinion."

"Hey, all I'm saying is that I had to clean up after your little bloodbath back there,"Sean complained, though there was no real heat in his voice."Do you have any idea how hard it is to dispose of three bodies without leaving evidence? In my defense, I'm a doctor-I'm supposed to save lives.not hide corpses!"

Ethan's quiet assistant Arya appeared with a tray of tea, setting it on the coffee table.
"I thought you might need this," she said softly, her eyes lingering on Ethan.

"Thank you." Ethan replied, his voice gentler than I'd heard it all night. "It's late. You should get some rest now."

Arya hesitated, clearly reluctant to leave. "But-"

"Go on." Ethan insisted. "Summer's room is right next to yours. Keep an ear out in case she needs anything."
"Alright," Arya conceded. "I'll be upstairs if you need me,right next to Summer."

"Thank you, Arya," I acknowledged.

Once Arya had disappeared upstairs, I turned to the others. "Mexican hitmen," I stated without preamble. "Three of them. They said someone paid top dollar for my head."

"Well, well," Sean grinned, leaning forward. "Brandon Stark, making enemies in style. Professionals, no less! Though I have to say, your combat skills have improved-almost up to Ethan's level now. Who knew our finance prodigy was secretly Rambo?"

"Want a demonstration?" I asked coolly.

Sean held up his hands in mock surrender. "Pass! I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Besides, I'm way more interested in who hates you enough to hire international assassins. That's some serious grudge territory."

"Let's focus," Ethan cut in, his expression serious. "Brandon, what's your assessment?"
I considered the question carefully. "I've made plenty of enemies on Wall Street over the years, but none who would resort to something like this.Business rivals might try to ruin me financially or socially, but murder?Especially using Mexican hitmen? It doesn't fit."

"Agreed," Edward said, setting down his cup. "Most of your business enemies are far too concerned with their own reputations to risk something so messy. Besides, the weaponry these men carried was military-grade. This wasn't just a hit-it was a coordinated attack designed to eliminate you with extreme prejudice. And the ambush at your estate was a backup plan, indicating whoever planned this wasn't taking chances."

"There's something else," Edward continued, his expression grim."Something that doesn't add up."
"What's that?" I asked,though I had my suspicions.

"Based on the communications we intercepted," Edward explained, "they had different orders regarding Summer. They were instructed to kill you but capture her alive."

Ethan nodded in confirmation. "When I intercepted them, they were clearly trying to run Summer off the road without causing fatal damage.One of the men admitted as much before I killed him. They wanted your wife alive, Brandon."

A cold fury settled in my chest. "Who would want Summer? She doesn't have enemies-certainly none capable of organizing something like this."

"That's what makes this unusual," Ethan observed. "Summer seems an unlikely target for international assassins. Which suggests..."
"That she was targeted because of her connection to me," I finished."But
not many people know about our marriage."

"Perhaps it's not about your marriage specifically," Edward suggested."Maybe someone discovered she's important to you and decided to use her as leverage."

"Or there's something about Summer herself we're missing." Sean added.unusually serious for once.

I thought of the Taylor family, of all the strangeness surrounding Summer's relationship with them. There had always been something off there-something I hadn't quite figured out yet despite my investigations.

"I'll get to the bottom of this," I stated with cold determination. "Whatever it takes."

The others exchanged glances but didn't argue. They knew me well enough to recognize when I'd made up my mind.

"In the meantime," Ethan said, "I suggest you both stay here. Your Hamptons estate is compromised, and we need time to ensure it's secure again."

I nodded in agreement. "Summer's safety is my priority."

"And finding out who's trying to kill you should be a close second,"Sean pointed out dryly.

"Yes," I replied, my voice hardening. "Finding out who's behind this-and making them pay."

After finalizing our plans, the others prepared to leave. I felt in my pocket and turned to Ethan. "I owe you one."
Ethan smiled slightly. "I thought you'd be upset that I scared her."He reflected on Summer witnessing his lethal skills earlier. "At least it was me she saw in action, not you." He added, "Though I have to say, she's got some nerve. No screaming,no fainting-pretty impressive."

Most people would have completely fallen apart witnessing what Summer had seen tonight, but she'd remained composed, if a bit shocked. Ethan narrowed his eyes thoughtfully, as if reminded of something from his past.
I frowned slightly but still said, "Whatever the case, I appreciate your help today."

"It's late," Ethan replied. "Go get some rest."

After I headed upstairs, Ethan pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his pants pocket. His long fingers extracted one, holding it between two fingers as his unfocused eyes stared out the window.

That night, James, Desmond, and Landon cleared out all the assassins lying in wait near the Hamptons estate. There weren't that many, but each was highly skilled. If I had returned home alone, even with my combat abilities, I couldn't have handled so many attackers at once.

"Sir, all targets have been neutralized. What are your next orders?" James reported over the phone.

"Good work. Take the day off tomorrow-you've earned it," I replied,ending the call. Turning back, I saw Summer still peacefully asleep.I smiled,walking over to pull up the blanket she'd kicked off in her sleep.As I started to move away, her hand suddenly shot out, grabbing mine firmly.

"Brandon," she murmured, still half-asleep, "don't go."
###Chapter 226: You Think I Have Mental
Problems

**Summer's POV**

I gradually drifted back to consciousness, warm and comfortable in unfamiliar sheets. My hand was gripping something firmly-something warm and solid. As my eyes fluttered open. I realized with a jolt that I was clutching Brandon's hand like it was a lifeline.

Brandon sat on the edge of the bed, immaculately dressed in a fresh suit.reading something on his tablet. He must have felt me stir because his eyes immediately shifted to mine.

"Hey." he said, his voice soft.

"How are you feeling? Sleep well?" He reached over, gently tucking a strand of hair behind my ear.

"Yeah, really well," I replied, stifling a yawn.

My eyes drifted to the bedside clock and widened in shock. "Oh my God.is it that late already?"

I bolted upright, suddenly remembering where we were-not in our Hamptons estate, but in Ethan Kennedy's Manhattan residence. The events of last night came flooding back-the car chase, the assassins,Ethan killing those men with such terrifying ease...

"Last night..." I began, my voice shaking slightly.

"Wash up and come downstairs. Breakfast is waiting." Brandon interrupted, clearly trying to steer me away from those thoughts.
"Oh.,. okay." I replied, letting him change the subject. For now.

In the bathroom, I stared at my reflection while brushing my teeth.My mind kept replaying the events of last night.

After splashing cold water on my face, I padded back toward the bedroom.stopping abruptly in the doorway. Brandon was in the middle of changing his shirt, his broad back and toned muscles on full display. Despite everything, I felt my cheeks flush hot.

He caught my reflection in the mirror and turned, a knowing smirk playing at his lips. "It's nothing you haven't seen before. Why so shy?"

"Shut up," I muttered, trying and failing to sound annoyed.

I noticed clothes laid out on the bed-a simple but stylish blouse and jeans.The price tags were still attached.

"Did you go shopping for me this morning?" I asked incredulously.

Brandon shook his head. "Arya picked them up. Hurry and get dressed."

They fit perfectly, which was both impressive and slightly unnerving.

Brandon led me downstairs, his warm hand firmly entwined with mine.As we descended the grand staircase, I was shocked to see the living room filled with people-Ethan Kennedy, Arya, Edward Lee,Dr.Sean,James Wilson, Landon, and Desmond. Every pair of eyes swiveled to us as we entered.

Dr. Sean was the first to break the slightly awkward silence, bounding forward with his usual cheery demeanor.
"Well, good morning, Mrs. Stark!" he exclaimed with a bright smile."How
are you feeling? Last night was pretty late, and you were already asleep when we wanted to check on you, but Brandon wouldn't let us dlisturb you." He shot Brandon a playful glance. "You have no idea how worried we all were!"

Brandon's icy glare could have frozen hell, and Sean immediately backpedaled.

"Anyway, the important thing is you're okay," he finished lamely.

I couldn't help but laugh at his rapid retreat. "I'm fine, Sean. Thanks for your concern."

"Ignore him," Brandon said dismissively, before addressing the room at large."Why is everyone here?"
Edward leaned back in his chair, the picture of casual arrogance. "What,we can't drop by to check on you? I own property in this neighborhood too,you know. Don't forget, all these houses were my development projects."

Brandon's smile didn't reach his eyes. "How thoughtful of you all."

He turned to me. "Are you hungry?"

Caught off guard by the sudden attention, I felt every eye in the room on me. I tugged gently at Brandon's hand, uncomfortable with being the center of focus. "I'm fine!."

Brandon accepted a cigarette from Ethan but just held it.

"So you're planning to have them follow me around 24/7 now?" he asked,not bothering to hide his irritation.
Ethan tapped ash from his cigarette. "We don't know who's behind this yet. You're not just thinking about yourself anymore, Brandon. You have Summer now."

Brandon fell silent fora moment. "Having so many people following me around will draw attention. If the Stark family notices, my father will start asking questions."

Edward spoke up. "And if no one's watching your back, what happened yesterday could happen again at any moment. Maybe you could evade them, but what about Summer?"

Brandon's jaw clenched, but he finally nodded. "Fíne. Your people can follow me, but they needto stay hidden. I don't need that many guards-assign more of them to Summer."

He turned to Desmond. "Select six men to watch over my wife."

"Yes, sir. And for you?" Desmond asked.

"Two will be sufficient," Brandon said firmly.

Desmond's face creased with concern. "That's not enough,sir. Let me assign at least four to your detail."
"Two," Brandon repeated, his tone brooking no argument.

Ethan nodded, stubbing out his cigarette. "We'll do it Brandon's way."Then, with characteristic abruptness, he added, "Now that we've settled that,the rest of you can leave."

Dr.Sean's face fell comically. "Hey, come on, Ethan! That's no way to treat friends."
Edward was already standing. "It's fine. I have matters to attend to at the office anyway."

Dr. Sean lingered a moment longer before sighing dramatically. "Fine, fine,I know when I'm not wanted. Brandon, make sure you bring Summer by the hospital later."

Brandon's expression remained neutral, but I saw the subtle nod he gave Sean.

Several hours later, Brandon and I walked through the pristine corridors of Manhattan General Hospital. My nerves were still on edge, jumping at every loud noise or sudden movement.

Dr.Sean looked genuinely surprised when we entered his office. "Brandon?I didn't actually expect you to show up." He looked us both over carefully."Are you injured? Did something happen?"

Brandon shook his head. "Where's that psychologist who works with you?The one you mentioned last month?"

I froze, my head snapping toward Brandon. "A psychologist? Why do you need to see a psychologist?"

Dr.Sean seemed equally confused. "Yeah, what's going on? You're literally the last person I'd expect to have psychological issues. You're alarmingly normal,honestly."
His eyes narrowed as he studied Brandon more carefully. "Wait... don't tell me you were traumatized by what happened yesterday? You?"

Brandon's mouth tightened with annoyance as he glared at Sean.

That's when it hit me. The reason we were here, why Brandon had agreed
so readily to Sean's suggestion to bring me to the hospital.

"Brandon," I said slowly, my voice rising with indignation, "do you think *
I* have mental problems?"
###Chapter 227:Taking Meave Home

**Summer's POV**

Dr. Sean raised his hands defensively, backing away like he'd accidentally wandered into a minefield. "Okay, I'm just gonna..." he pointed at the door."leave you two to sort this out. Brandon, talk to your wife properly,for God's sake."

Brandon shot him a death glare before turning back to me,his expression softening.

"Summer," he began, his voice that special kind of patient that only emerged when he was trying very hard not to sound irritated, "bringing you to see a psychologist doesn't mean you have mental problems."
"Then what exactly does it mean?" I folded my arms across my chest."Because from where I'm standing, it sure looks like you think I'm going crazy after last night."

Brandon sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose-his universal sign of gathering patience. "Your nerves are frayed. You're tense. Last night was...intense. I brought you here so the doctor could help you relax,not because I think< there's something wrong with you."

I bit my lip, considering his words. The fear that Brandon might not make it back alive... MMaybe I was a little on edge.
"Look," Brandon's voice gentled as he took my hands in his,"I just want to make sure you're okay. No one is going to think you have problems.I promise."
My shoulders slumped as the fight drained out of me. "Fine. I'll see the
doctor. But I'm seriously okay, Brandon. I just... I never saw anyone killed before. I wasn't prepared for that."

Brandon's eyes turned solemn. "I know. And I promise I won't leave you alone like that again."

I squeezed his hands, nodding. "You better not."

Half an hour later, we walked out of Manhattan General. The session had been surprisingly helpful-just some relaxation techniques and a chance to process what had happened. Nothing too intrusive.

"See? That wasn't so bad," I said, squinting in the afternoon sunlight. "I told you I was fine, just a little tense. I'll work on my mental state, I promise."

Brandon nodded, his hand warm against the small of my back as he guided me to the car. "Hmm."



"Brandon, Summer! You're finally back!" Meave's worried voice greeted us the moment we stepped through the door of the Hamptons estate.Her elegant figure appeared in the foyer, her face a mixture of relief and concern. "You two didn't come home last night and didn't even call.Brandon, I expected better from you! Gavin and I waited up for so long,only to get your call this morning!"

Brandon gave her a casual half-smile. "I'm sure Uncle Gavin was thrilled we didn't come home. Rare opportunity for you two to have some alone time without us third-wheeling,right?"
I nudged him with my elbow before turning to Meave with an apologetic smile. "I'm so sorry o-
were exhausted... I promise next time we're staying out or coming home late, we'll call you,okay?"

Meave's expression softened. "Well, it doesn't matter now. Actually,Gavin and I were planning to head back to the Stark mansion anyway."

"You're leaving?" I couldn't hide the disappointment in my voice."Why?Aren't you comfortable here?"

"Of course I am! Don't be silly," Meave reassured me. "We've been staying here quite a while. We only came for my health, and this is your home with Brandon. Our place is at the Stark family mansion."

My heart sank at the thought of Meave leaving. Over"the past weeks, I'd grown so attached to her presence in our home-her gentle wisdom, her warmth, the way she made even the enormous Hamptons estate feel like a real home.

"But..." I started, then stopped, not knowing what else to say.

Brandon placed a comforting hand on my shoulder. "Where's Uncle Gavin?



"He stepped out to take a phone call," Meave replied, then looked between us with a knowing smile. "You two look tired. Was work busy today?"

Before I could answer, my emotions overwhelmed me. To my complete mortification, tears welled up in my eyes and spilled over. "I don't want you to go," I said, my voice small and watery.
"Oh, sweetheart!"Meave's arms were around me in an instant. "I'm just going home, not disappearing forever. If you miss me, just call, and I'll come see you!"
I sniffled against her shoulder, feeling ridiculous but unable to stop. "I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm being so emotional."

Meave stroked my hair gently. "It's alright. You remind me so much of Grace sometimes..."

Her voice trailed off, and I could feel her own grief rising to the surface.Grace-Gavin's daughter Katniss Kennedy who now went by Grace Stark-was a painful subject for Meave.

"Please don't be sad," I said, pulling back and wiping my eyes. "I promise I'll call you all the time after you go back. We can meet for coffee! Scarlett and I opened a small coffee shop together. I'd love to take you there sometime."

Meave's smile returned, bright and genuine. "I'd love that." She turned to Brandon,who had been watching our exchange with uncharacteristic patience. "Brandon, I'm leaving Summer in your care. Don't you dare mistreat her while we're gone, or I'll come back and set you straight."

Brandon's lips twitched. "Yes, ma'am."

"Brandon, would you mind bringing our bags down?" Meave asked.

As Brandon disappeared upstairs, I made one more attempt. "Meave,why the rush? Couldn't you stay a little longer? At least stay for dinner?"
She cupped my face in her soft hands. "Silly girl, there will be plenty of chances to see each other. I'm waiting for Brandon to officially bring you to the Stark family home. How about that?"

The ride to the Stark mansion was filled with Meave's stories. Brandon drove while Meave and I sat in the back seat, her voice animated as she regaled me with tales of B-----
"Summer, you wouldn't believe it-Brandon was such a handsome little boy, but he always had this serious face!" Meave laughed. "All the little girls had crushes on him, but he was never interested!"

I couldn't help sneaking glances at Brandon in therearview mirror,trying to imagine him as a solemn-faced child. It was almost impossible to picture.

Meave continued, oblivious to our exchange."He was so smart, too. While other children were still in middle school and high school, he skipped straight to university.

"You were the reason for that, Meave," Brandon said softly, his eyes meeting hers in the mirror. "Without you, there would be no Brandon Stark today."

"You two are meant for each other," Meave said, taking my hand. "No matter what challenges you face, never give up on each other. Trust each other,support each other. Promise?"

"I understand, Meave," I said, squeezing her hand. "When I married Brandon, I committed to a lifetime together."

In the rearview mirror, I caught Brandon's expression softening, the hard lines of his face relaxing into something almost tender.

As we pulled up to the imposing Stark family mansion, Brandon turned to me. "Stay in the car. I'll just help Meave with her bags and be right back."

"Okay," I agreed, watching as he helped Meave out of the car and retrieved their luggage from the trunk.

Brandon leaned down to the window. "Wait here. I won't be long."
"Got it!" I smiled, settling back in my seat.

I was scrolling through emails on my phone when a melodic female voice broke the silence.

"Brandon! You're back?"

My head jerked up. Elle Sinclair was rushing toward Brandon and Meave,her face lit with excitement.

"Aunt Jane, look who's here!" she called out. "It's Brandon! He came to see you!"
###Chapter 228: Can't Stay

**Brandon's POV**

I helped Meave out of the car, steadying her with a gentle hand on her elbow. The last thing I wanted was for her to return to this toxic environment, but I understood her sense of duty.

"Careful with that step," I murmured, grabbing her luggage with my free hand.

Just as we reached the front steps, Elle came rushing toward us.

"Brandon! You're here!" Her voice was high-pitched with excitement, arms outstretched.

My cold stare stopped her in her tracks. She recovered quickly,turning to Meave with a saccharine smile.

"Aunt Meave, it's been so long! How have you been?" Elle gushed, words dripping with false enthusiasm.

Meave raised an eyebrow. "Didn't we just see each other yesterday?"

"Oh, that's right!" Elle's smile faltered momentarily. "Aunt Meave. Let me help you inside!"

"That won't be necessary," Meave replied politely. She turned to me,eyes kind but insistent. "Brandon, I can manage on my own. You should go if you have other matters to attend to."
I hesitated. "If you're sure,Aunt Meave?"

My mother's voice cut through the air.
"You're back but not coming inside?" Jane emerged from the doorway."What matters are so urgent? You don't even have time to see your mother?



Meave sighed softly. "Jane, Brandon has someone waiting for him."

"What?" Jane's voice rose sharply. "Your own daughter disappeared for three whole years without a care for you, and now you're trying to keep me from seeing my son?"

"That's enough!" I finally snapped.

"Brandon, I'm your mother. How ean you speak to me this way? You know this woman-"

"What 'woman'?" I cut her off coldly. "This is the woman who raised me.In my heart, she is my mother! During the fifteen years you were absent,Aunt Meave cared for me day and night. Everything she does is for my well-being. Mother, you shouldn't slander her." I turned back to Meave,voice softening instantly. "Aunt Meave, you must be tired standing.Let me help you inside."

As we climbed the granad staircase, I kept my pace slow to match Meave's.Jane and Elle trailed behind us.

"Aunt Meave," I said quietly, "please don't take what just happened to heart."

"Silly boy, am I that petty? Your mother has a point though-she is your biological mother,while I..."
"Please don't belittle yourself, Aunt Meave. In my heart, I truly see you as my mother." I glanced down the hallway. "Uncle Gavin isn't home yet,and I'm worried they might confra-
stay in your room for now."

She smiled understandingly. "Summer is waiting alone in the car-aren't you worried about keeping her waiting?"

"I'll head back now. Please visit us when you can, Aunt Meave.Summer and I would love to have you!"

After ensuring Meave was comfortable, I turned to leave, only to find Jane and Elle waiting at the top of the stairs.

"Brandon, why not stay for dinner? Or you could spend the night! We have plenty of rooms, or you could use your old room. I've kept it clean for whenever you return."

"That won't be necessary. I need to leave now."

"Brandon, what could possibly be so urgent? It's already getting late,and Elle mentioned your company is closed for the next few days. Are you in such a hurry to leave because you don't want to see your mother?"

I moved past them down the stairs. I was nearly at the bottom when Jane's composure shattered.

"Stop right there, you ungrateful child!" she shouted. "Is this how you treat your birth mother? I carried you for ten months, and this is how you repay me? I've already humbled myself so much, and if you had any conscience at all, you'd at least have a meal with me!" Her voice rose higher. "Tell me, was it that woman upstairs who taught you this? Her own daughters have abandoned her, one after another, and now she's trying to monopolize you. She stole another woman's husband, and now she wants to steal my son?"

I turned slowly, fury coursing thr-
have nothing to do with Aunt Meave. I'm leaving simply because I don't want to see you or your precious niece. If you had any self-awareness,you'd leave the Stark mansion and New York immediately.."

"Brandon, I'm your mother,you-"

"Now you remember you're my mother?" I asked coldly. "When I needed you most, you treated me as a burden. I know I'm not the child of you and the man you truly loved, which is why you abandoned my father so completely and avoided me like the plague. Don't test my patience further.



"Brandon, but your father wronged me first! He had another woman. Alice Stark is proof of his betrayal. Have you forgotten? That girl,she -"

"Alice couldn't join the Stark family because of you. What you owe to Alice and her mother can never be repaid."

"No, how could I possibly owe that homewrecker anything? She destroyed my family! She's shameless!"

"I won't discuss the truth of what happened with you. This is my final warning: don't harass Aunt Meave, don't threaten my father, or you'll lose what little tolerance I have left for you."

Turning to the Butler, I changed the subject. "Where's my grandfather?"

"Mr. William went out with some friends today, sir. He hasn't returned yet.Are you leaving now, Mr.Stark?"

"Yes, take good care of Aunt Meave. Uncle Gavin is handling some business and will return shortly. Aunt Meave is resting in her room.Have someone keep watch, and don't let anyone disturb her until Uncle Gavin returns, or they'll face consequences"
"Yes. Mr. Stark. Have a safe trip." He turned to the women. "Mrs. Sinclair,Miss Sinclair. I'll go check on Mrs. Stark now. If you're tired or hungry,please inform the staff."

"Hmph! Watchdog!" Jane snorted.

Before I could reach my car, Elle came tearing after me.

"Brandon, wait for me! Don't go!" she called desperately. "Brandon,you just arrived, how can you leave already? Isn't this your home?"

She caught up to me, grabbing my arm. "I've been in New York for months, and you never spend time with me. Brandon, I'm your fiancée!Brandon,please stay! Or take me with you-we can go out for dinner, and then I can go to your place, okay?"
###Chapter 229: Don't Play with Fire

**Summer's POV**

I watched from the car as Elle clung to Brandon's waist like her life depended on it, her manicured fingers digging into the fabric of his suit.The scene unfolding before me was like something straight out of a soap opera-too dramatic to be real, yet happening right in front of my eyes.

"Let go!" Brandon's voice cut through the air, cold and commanding. Even from inside the car with the windows up, I could hear the steel in his tone.

Elle flinched momentarily, but quickly recovered, shaking her head frantically. "No, Brandon, please don't go!" Her voice was pitched high with desperation.

She tightened her grip around him, face tilted up in supplication."Brandon, I know you've always cared about me, haven't you? I'm begging you! You're angry at your aunt, but don't take it out on me! I haven't done anything wrong!"

Brandon's jawline hardened, his eyebrows drawing together. "I'll say it one more time. Let. Go."

Brandon's fingers closed around her hand, squeezing with deliberate force.There was no gentleness in his grip, no consideration for her being a woman. He was treating her exactly as he would any unwelcome contact-with clinical efficiency and zero mercy.

Elle's scream pierced the air as her face drained of color. "Brandon, it hurts! Let go, please! You're hurting me!"
"Then release your hold," Brandon commanded.
"No!" Elle cried out, stubborn even through her pain. "I won't! The moment I do, you'll leave. I won't allow that."

Something dark flashed in Brandon's eyes. With a swift, powerful motion,he twisted her wrist and forcibly removed her grip, sending her flying backward. Elle landed hard on the ground, skidding a few feet. Her palms and elbows scraped against the pavement,drawing blood.

"Brandon!" she sobbed, curling into herself. "How could you do this to me?How could you push me away?"

Brandon stood a good fifteen feet from her, looking down with an expression of pure disgust. Without hesitation, he shrugged out of his expensive suit jacket-the one Elle had touched-and tossed it into a nearby trash can as if it were contaminated.

I watched, wide-eyed, as he pulled out a handkerchief and methodically wiped his hands, his face a mask of revulsion. It was like he'd touched something rotten and couldn't wait to cleanse himself.

Elle's face went ashen as the reality of Brandon's feelings finally seemed to sink in. She struggled to sit up, her hands clenched into fists so tight that blood seeped between her fingers, creating a truly pitiful image.
"Brandon, please don't treat me like this," she whimpered, biting her lip."I m your-"

"Enouagh," Brandon cut her off sharply. "This is the last warning. The next time you touch me without my permission, the consequences will be far worse than what happened today."

Brandon's voice dropped to a deadly whisper as he delivered his final warning. "You're a Sinclair, my cousin. Remember your place. If you can't
do that, you won't just be unwelcome in the Stark household-I'll make sure you're unwelcome in the Sinclair family too, My capabilities... your aunt knows them well."

Elle's eyes widened in shock, and she glanced behind Brandon. I followed her gaze and spotted Jane Sinclair standing on the mansion steps,her expression thunderous.

"Elle, what happened? Are you alright?" Jane rushed to her niece,kneeling beside her on the ground.

Brandonturned away from them without another word, striding toward our car with purposeful steps. I quickly straightened in my seat,pretending I hadn't been watching this whole scene unfold with bated breath.

The driver's door opened, and Brandon slid in beside me, his movements precise but tense. I could feel the anger radiating off him in waves.

Before he could even start the engine, Elle broke free from Jane's grasp and sprinted toward our car, yanking at the passenger door handle. My heart leaped into my throat as I frantically grabbed the handle from inside,keeping it shut.

"Brandon!" I whispered urgently, watching Elle's distorted face through the window as she continued to pull violently at the door.
Brandon's face darkened as he quickly hit the central locking system."Seatbelt," he reminded me, voice tight with barely controlled fury.
"Oh, right," I replied automatically, then winced when I realized Elle could probably hear me. The last thing we needed was for her to discover me-Brandon's wife-in the car with him.
Elle froze, her head tilting like a predator catching a scent. "Who's that?"she shrieked, pounding on the window. "Brandon, who's in there with you?"


She darted to the front of the car, trying to peer through the windshield.I ducked down instinctively, heart hammering in my chest.

Brandon glanced at me briefly, then back at Elle as she pounded on the hood of his car. Something dangerous flashed in his eyes-pure,cold irritation.

Without warning, he started the engine and slammed his foot on the accelerator. The car lurched forward, brushing past Elle with enough force to send her spinning. She fell hard, tumbling across the driveway before finally coming to rest against a decorative shrub.

I gasped, twisting in my seat to look back.

His eyes fixed steadily on the road ahead as we tore away from the Stark mansion.

In the rearview mirror, I could see Jane Sinclair rushing to Elle's side, her face a mask of shock and disbelief. Elle was clutching her side, sobbing hysterically as she pointed at our retreating car.



Brandon drove in tense silence, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. I studied his profile, noting the tight set of his jaw and the slight furrow between his brows. Something was clearly bothering him, and I had a pretty good guess what it was.
From what I'd gathered, Brandon rarely visited the Stark family mansion these days, primarily because of Ta G元
t been for Aunt Meave, I doubted he would have come at all today.

I couldn't help but feel for him. Jane Sinclair seemed likethe type who believed everyone else was wrong and she alone was right-the kind who would burn the world down before admitting any fault.

"Brandon?" I reached over hesitantly, placing my hand over his on the gearshift. "Are you okay?"

He attempted a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "It's nothing," he deflected, then quickly changed the subject. "What would you like for dinner tonight?"

I sighed, gently squeezing his hand. "Brandon, we're married. When something's bothering you, you should tell me. That's what marriage is-sharing the good and the bad. Keeping everything bottled up inside just makes it worse, doesn't it?"

"Silly girl, I'm fine," Brandon replied, his voice softer but unmistakably tired despite his attempts to hide it. "Just think about what you want to eat. WNe'll stop by the supermarket to pick up some fresh produce."

I nodded, accepting his evasion for now. "Alright."

A moment later, I leaned closer to him, my lips nearly brushing his ear as I whispered, "Brandon, no matter what happens, you still have me.I'll always be by your side."

I pressed a gentle kiss to his earlobe, then another to his jaw, feeling a slight shiver run through him at the contact.
Brandon's eyes darkened, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed hard.The car's speed gradualy decreased as he turned slightly to look at me,his gaze intense and filled with somethinth--
"Summer," he warned, his voice dropping to a low and dangerous tone,"don't play with fire."
###Chapter 230: Buying Rings

**Summer's POV**

I could see the flicker of desire in Brandon's eyes as he leaned toward me,his gaze dropping to my lips. My heart raced, but the reality of our situation crashed through the momentary haze of attraction.

"What are you doing?" I pushed against his chest, glancing anxiously at our,surroundings. "Do you realize where we are right now? Just drive!"

Brandon pulled back, the corner of his mouth twitching with amusement.He reached over andruffled my hair like I was a child.

"I'm starving," I announced instead, deliberately changing the subject. "Let's grab dinner at that Italian place on 5th Avenue-the one with the amazing garlic bread."

Brandon glanced at me, eyebrow raised. "Italian? Remind me again, how many times have you had pasta this month?"
"Is that a problem?" I challenged, folding my arms across my chest. "I like Italian food."

阿

"It's not that it's a problem," Brandon clarified, his tone softening. "But all that rich food might not be good for you. I'm just thinking about your health."

"It's decided-we're getting Italian." I protested.

Brandon's eyes softened as he studied my face for a moment. "Alright,if that's what you want."
I knew he'd seen through my ploy, After everything that had happened today. I wanted to get Brandon out of the house,distract him with something normal and comforting. A cozy Italian dinner seemed like the perfeet solution-warming and requiring enough attention that he couldn't brood over his family drama.

We drove to Giorgio's in Manhattan, one of those upscale Italian restaurants with authentic recipes and a wine list longer than most novels.The place was packed, but thanks to Brandon's foresight in making a reservation, we were immediately shown to a private corner table.

While I scanned the menu, debating between the fettuccine and the risotto,Brandon pulled outhis phone and stepped slightly away from the table.

"Why hasn't there been any movement on what I asked you to do?" His voice was low but sharp as he spoke to James.

I pretended not to listen, but couldn't help catching bits of their conversation.

"Mr. Stark, you mean...?" James's voice came faintly through the speaker.

"The photos. The task I gave you yesterday. Seems you've forgotten."

"You forgot. Wonderful," Brandon's tone was icy.

"Tonight?" Brandon considered. "Make it tomorrow morning. Get it done."

Brandon ended the call just as our appetizers arrived-fresh bruschetta and calamari fritti.
"What was that about?" I asked, gesturing to his phone. "I thought you were on holiday for the next few days. Why are you still giving James assignments?"
"Nothing important," Brandon dismissed, reaching across the table to take my right hand in his.

I blinked in confusion as he studied my fingers with unusual intensity.The waiter brought our main dishes-fettuccine alfredo for me and osso buco for Brandon.

"What are you doing?" I asked, tryng to pull my hand back. "The food's getting cold. Let go!"

"Hmm. it looks good," he agreed, releasing my hand. "Go ahead and eat."

Brandon twirled some of my pasta onto a fork and held it out to me.

"Stop that!" I protested, though I couldn't help smiling at his attentiveness.
"I have hands, you know. Eat your own food!"

We settled into a comfortable silence, the rich flavors warming me from the inside out. Occasionally, I'd catch Brandon glancing at my right hand again, but I couldn't figure out why it had suddenly become so fascinating to him.

After dinner, Brandon suggested we take a walk through the nearby shopping mall.
"Since when do you enjoy mall-walking?" I asked, surprised. Brandon usually avoided crowded retail spaces like the plague.
"Did I ever say I didn't?" he countered smoothly, taking my right hand in his. "Let's look around. We should probably buy some things while we're here."

"Hmm?" I gave him a puzzled look.
Brandon led me through the mall with purpose, bypassing the usual stores until we reached the third floor. When we stepped into the jewelry section,everything suddenly clicked into place.

"Is this why you've been staring at my hand all night?" I asked, finally understanding his strange behavior.

A sales associate approached us immediately, her professional smile widening when she spotted Brandon in his tailored suit.

"Sir, how can I help you today? Are you looking for a ring?" she asked eagerly.

Brandon ignored her, turning to me instead. "Wait & moment," he said,then guided me toward the display cases. "Take a look. Which one do you like?"

"So you really did bring me here to buy a ring!" I exclaimed.finally putting all the pieces together. "That's why you kept staring at my hand during dinner!"

"Just hurry up and choose one," Brandon urged, a hint of impatience in his voice.

I scanned the glittering displays, momentarily overwhelmed by the options.Most of the rings were ostentatious-large diamonds in elaborate settings that would draw attention from across a room.

"You don't like any of these?" Brandon asked, noting my hesitation.

"It's not that," I explained. "But I have to wear this to work. Something this expensive and flashy wouldn't be appropriate."
"What kind of ring do you want, then?"
"Something more understated. Simple design, nothing too elaborate." My eyes landed on a display of more minimalist bands. "Brandon, come look at this one. What do you think?"

Brandon gestured to the sales associate. "Bring that one over, please."

The associate's smile faltered slightly as she looked at my choice-a sleek platinum band with a modest diamond in a clean, modern setting. It was beautiful but significantly less expensive than the showier pieces.

"Sir, are you sure you wouldn't like to see some of our other options? This particular ring is-"

"Just bring it out," Brandon cut her off, his voice dropping to a dangerous register.

"I'll get it right away," she stammered, hurrying to retrieve the ring.

She returned moments later with the ring on a velvet cushion.Brandon took it and handed it to me.

"Try it on," he suggested.

I slipped it onto my right ring finger, admiring how the simple design caught the light. "What do you think? Does it look good?"
"Yes. It looks perfect," Brandon said, his eyes warm as they met mine.

"I think so too," I agreed,a flutter of happiness spreading through my chest. "Excuse me, could you please wrap this up for us?"
The sales associate nodded, but before she could take the ring, she spotted someone entering the store and her attention immediately shifted.

"Sir, are you looking to purchasei.--

please," she called out, completely abandoning us to greet the new customers.


To my surprise, no other sales associate was going to answer my request.

I was about to express my indignation when Brandon's hand tightened around mine. I turned to see what had caught his attention.

"Brandon? Summer? What are you two doing here?"Lonnie Caldwell stood before us, his arm wrapped around an elegantly dressed woman who I assumed was his fiancée.
###Chapter 231:No Thanks

**Summer's POV**

Brandon and I both spotted Lonnie at the same time, and my eyes immediately traveled to the delicate arm linked through his. A beautiful woman stood beside him, her elegant posture and designer outfit screaming old money.

Lonnie's gaze shifted to my hand and the ring I was still wearing. His eyes widened in understanding. "Speaking of which, you two had such a low-key wedding that you haven't even had a reception yet! Just picking out rings today?"

Lonnie examined the simple band on my finger, clearly noting it wasn't made of particularly expensive materials-just a simple, elegant design."Brandon, are you short on cash these days? Couldn't you buy something a bit nicer for Summer?" Lonnie's pointed glance toward the sales associate spoke volumes.

The salesperson's face immediately drained of color. The other staff members who had been watching from a distance exchanged nervous glances.

They might not have recognized Brandon, but Lonnie's deferential attitude made it clear that Brandon's status was significant.

Lonnie's expression darkened dramatically. "Call your manager out here.Now," he demanded, turning to address the entire sales team.

"M-manager?" one of the salespeople stammered. "Who are you? Our manager isn't here..."
"Not here? Fine." Lonnie's voice dropped to a dangerous register."Tell him that all of you, including him, need to be gone from this place by tomorrow morning."

The woman beside Lonnie touched his arm gently. "What's wrong? Why are you suddenly so angry?"


"What do you think?" Lonnie replied tersely. "These people have no idea who they're dealing with."

He turned back to the terrified staff. "Do you have any idea who this is?This is Brandon Stark, CEO of Stark Group. And you've just insulted his wife by treating her like she can't afford your mediocre jewelry."

Just then, a man in ·a well-tailored suit rushed over, wiping sweat from his brow with a handkerchief. "Mr. Caldwell! I didn't expect to see you today.Is there a problem?"

"Is there a problem?" Lonnie repeated incredulously. "Do you train your staff to turn deaf ear to customers? Is that how you do business?"

"I don't understand-" the manager began.

"Your sales associate here," Lonnie pointed at the woman who had been helping us, "decided that Summer wasn't worth her time because she chose a simpler ring instead of the flashy,overpriced ones."
"This is unacceptable! I assure you, this will be addressed immediately,"the manager sputtered, turning to us with a desperate smile. "Mr. Stark,Mrs. Stark, please accept my deepest apologies. I would be honored to offer you our finest pieces at a special discount-"
"That won't be necessary," Brandon cut him off coldly.
Lonnie turned to us, his anger shifting to a charming smile. "Brandon,Summer, at least let me make this right. Consider it my wedding gift to you both-any ring in this store, on me."

I exchanged a glance with Brandon, touched by Lonnie's gesture but also uncomfortable with the scene unfolding before us.


"Actually, I think this simple ring isperfect," I said, feeling protective of both Brandon and my choice. "Marriage is about the twoof us, not about how expensive our jewelry is. What matters is the sentiment behind it." I examined the ring on my finger before shaking my head slightly. "Besides,we've been married a while without rings, so it's not like we desperately need them. It's getting late-maybe we should head home."

I examined the ring on my finger before shaking my head slightly."Besides, we've been married a while without rings, so it's not like we desperately need them. It's getting late-maybe we should head home."

Brandon's lips curved into a slight smile at my words. "Alright," he agreed,before turning back to Lonnie. "Thank you for the offer, but we'll pass."

Brandon placed the ring back in its display case, then took my hand.ready to leave. Lonnie quickly stopped us.

"Why the rush to leave?" he asked. "It's rare to run into each other like this. Why don't we go grab some tea together?"

"That won't be necessary," Brandon glanced at his watch. "It's getting late.We'll catch up another time."

"Well, if you insist," Lonnie conceded, noting Brandon's less-than-enthusiastic mood. "But you absolutely must invite us to your wedding reception when you have one."
"Of course," Brandon nodded curtly before guiding me out of the store.

As we walked away, I couldn't help smiling a little. "Should we have accepted his offer?" I asked, half-joking. "That diamond solitaire in the front case was pretty spectacular."

Brandon and I emerged from the mall, with me still chuckling. "Are we being too hard on Lonnie? We deliberately avoided Stark Group's malls to keep a low profile, and then we run into him anyway."

Brandon's expression remained neutral, though his brow furrowed slightly."Did you really like that ring?"

I shook my head. "I wanted it at first, but then I thought about it. It's not like we absolutely need rings. We've been married all this time without them! Besides, if I start wearing a ring, people will ask questions about the wedding,which seems like more trouble than it's worth."

"But we are married," Brandon said, his fingers lightly brushing against mine. "Not wearing rings seems... wrong somehow.You're my wife."

"I know that," I laughed. "Come on, we can buy rings another time,right?It's not urgent." I tugged at his hand playfully. "Let's get out of here-it's freezing!"


I pulled Brandon along as we half-jogged through the parking lot,our breath forming clouds in the cold night air. By the time we reached the car,the city lights were twinkling all around us, and we realized just how late it had gotten.
###Chapter 232: Secret Relationship

Victoria's POV
A persistent buzzing dragged me from sleep. I rolled over in the plush hotel bed, blindly groping for my phone on the nightstand. 7:13 AM—ridiculously early.
"Hello?" I mumbled, my voice thick with sleep.
"Victoria?" Maya's voice exploded through the speaker, sharp and urgent. "You need to look at today's news. Right now. It’s a disaster."
I sat up, rubbing my eyes. "What news? Is it about the Diana contract?" A smile tugged at my lips. My successful appearance at the Stark Group annual party had already started paying dividends. "Is the coverage that good?"
"Just check the headlines," Maya snapped. "It's everywhere, and it’s not the kind of publicity we wanted. Call me back after you've seen it."
Alexander stirred beside me. "Who's calling so early?" he mumbled, propping himself up on one elbow.
I covered the phone with my hand. "Shh, it's Maya. Something about the news coverage. Can you pull up the New York Daily on your phone?"
He nodded sleepily, reaching for his device. I waited, my heart beginning to thud against my ribs. I hung up just as Alexander let out a sharp exclamation of disbelief beside me. His entire body had gone rigid, his face darkening as he stared at the screen.
"Alex? What is it? What's going on?"
I didn't finish my question. Alexander practically shoved his phone toward me, his movements jerky and filled with suppressed rage. I caught it, my breath hitching in my throat.
"What the hell?" I whispered, looking at him.
"That's what I should be asking you!" Alexander snarled. "Is this what you meant by 'networking' with Brandon Stark? Is this how you ‘secure’ your future?"
I grabbed the phone, my blood turning to ice as I saw the headline:
STARK’S NEW FAVORITE: ACTRESS VICTORIA TAYLOR’S HIDDEN CONNECTION WITH BILLIONAIRE CEO BRANDON STARK REVEALED
Below it was a photo of Brandon and me at the annual party. The angle was intentionally deceptive; it made it look like we were sharing an intimate, private moment, his hand lingering near mine as he announced my new position as Diana's spokesperson.
"This isn't what it looks like," I stammered, scrolling frantically through the article. "Alex, you have to believe me! This is just a bad photo!"
The story was worse than I'd expected. It detailed how Brandon had "personally revived" my career after my recent scandals, suggesting our relationship was far from strictly professional. It specifically highlighted the Diana brand contract, implying that I had used "unconventional methods" and personal favors to secure the role rather than my actual talent.
"Not what it looks like?" Alexander laughed bitterly, a cold sound that made me flinch. "The photo seems pretty clear to me. The way you're looking at him... like he’s your personal savior, or something more."
"That's not—" I began, but my words died as I continued reading.
Sources close to Stark Entertainment confirm that Taylor has received exclusive treatment since joining the agency, with multiple prime opportunities steered her way through private channels despite her recent public controversies.
"Alex, please," I pleaded, my voice cracking. "This is all fabricated. You know how the media twists things to sell papers. Brandon offered me the Diana contract because I'm the face they need!"
Alexander threw back the covers and climbed out of bed, his movements sharp and angry. "The face they need? Or was it because of what’s happening behind closed doors?"
"I’m not doing anything!" I cried. "Alex, you know me better than that! I would never jeopardize us."
"Do I?" He cut me off, yanking his dress shirt from the closet. "Because the Victoria I thought I knew wouldn't let another man get that close to her. Look at that photo, Victoria. It looks like a betrayal."
"It's a manipulative angle!" I protested, jumping out of bed to follow him. "I was just grateful for the opportunity! Brandon is my boss, my mentor—nothing more!"
Alexander buttoned his shirt with quick, efficient movements. "You know what's funny? I actually felt guilty for how things ended between us before. I thought bringing you here, spending time together... that maybe we could start over."
He pulled on his pants, his eyes avoiding mine. "What a joke. All this time, you've been playing both sides."
"No, Alex, please—" I grabbed his arm. My eyes burned with tears. This scandal could destroy the bridge I’d just rebuilt with the Stark family. "There's nothing between Brandon and me. I promise, this is a calculated attack by the press. I'll fix it!"
Alexander yanked his arm from my grasp. "If it's really a misunderstanding, then fix it. But don't expect me to sit around and watch you play the victim."
He snatched his wallet and phone from the nightstand.
"Where are you going?" I asked, panic rising.
"I need air," he snapped. "I can't even look at you right now without seeing that headline."
He strode to the door, ignoring my pleas to stay and talk. I stood in the center of the room, suddenly aware of how vulnerable I looked in just an oversized T-shirt. With the tabloid story breaking, I felt like the walls were closing in.
I slipped back onto the bed, leaning my head against the headboard. Everything had been going so perfectly. Now it was all falling apart. I dialed Sophie with shaking hands.
"Hey, Victoria! How's Philly? Having fun with Alex?" Her voice was bright, carefree, which only made me feel worse.
"Fun?" I choked out. "Sophie, my world is imploding! Have you seen the news?"
"News? No, I've been offline all morning. What happened?"
"I'm all over the tabloids with Brandon Stark!" I cried.
"Wait, is that a bad thing?" Sophie sounded confused. "I thought you wanted that association—"
"Are you serious? I'm with Alexander! Their families are close friends! And now there are headlines suggesting I’m trading favors with Brandon to get ahead! Alexander just walked out!"
"Okay, okay, calm down," Sophie said quickly, her tone shifting to business mode. "I didn't realize the angle they took. What does Brandon say? Has the agency released a statement?"
"I don't know! Maya is trying to handle it, but it’s a mess. Sophie, you have to help me. This could ruin my reputation and my relationship."
"Victoria, you need to get back to New York immediately," Sophie said firmly. "This isn't something you can fix from a hotel room in Philly. You need to do damage control in person. Brandon will protect his own image first—you need to make sure you’re part of that protection."
"But what about Alexander? If I leave now, it looks like I’m running away."
"Forget about Alexander for a minute! He's angry, but he'll listen to reason once the headlines change. Right now, your career is on the line. Get home."
"I know how this works," I snapped, the adrenaline finally starting to kick in. "Just get my travel sorted."
I hung up and sat on the edge of the bed, my mind racing. How had this happened? Who had taken that photo and sold it with such a poisonous narrative? This wasn't random bad luck—someone had deliberately set out to tear me down just as I reached the top.
The question was: who?
The Billionaire's suaden bhde
###Chapter 233: She's Landing at JFK at 3

**Sophie's POV**

I hung up the phone, allowing myselfa moment of pure, unadulterated satisfaction. The trap had been laid perfectly, and Victoria had walked right into it, never suspecting that her "best friend" had orchestrated her downfall.


My bedroom door creaked open, and my mother appeared with a plate of sliced fruit.


"Was that Victoria again?" She asked, her lips pressed into a thin line of disapproval. "Your father and I told you to stay away from that woman.Haven't you been hurt enough already?"

I accepted the plate with a grateful smile. "Mom, please drop it. It's precisely because I was hurt that I need to stay close to her."

Mom sat on the edge of my bed, her face creased with worry. "Sophie,sweetie, there are better ways to heal. Why not take that study abroad opportunity in London? Get away from New York for a while, start fresh somewhere new."


"I can't leave yet," I said firmly, setting the fruit aside. "I need to finish this. After that, I'll go wherever you want-London, Paris, the moon. But until then, I'm not leaving New York. End of discussion."


My mother threw her hands up in frustration and stormed out. I could hear her voice rising as she complained to my father in the kitchen.

"That girl is so stubborn! I don't understand why she's fixated on that horrible Victoria woman!"
My father's deeper voice rumbled in response. "I think Sophie's right. Why should our daughter suffer while that woman gets away scot-free? Mark my words-karma's coming for Victoria Taylor, and I say good riddance."

I slipped out of bed and padded to the kitchen doorway, catching my father's eye.

"Sophie," he said, his expression softening. "You know I've got your back,honey. As long as you don't cross any major lines, I support whatever you need to do."


My throat tightened unexpectedly. After everything I'd been through-the drugging at Victoria's party, the humiliation, being used as a pawn in her games-my parents had never wavered in their support.

"Thanks, Dad," I managed. "I promise, once this is over, I'll leave New York. Fresh start, just like Mom wants."

Back in my room, I pulled up the news on my laptop, barely containing my glee as I scrolled through the headlines.

Each article featured the same damning photo-Brandon and Victoria,his hand on hers, their faces close together as he announced her new position.The angle was perfect, making the professional interaction look intimate.secretive.


I dialed Maya, Victoria's manager, keeping my voice carefully neutral.

"Maya? It's Sophie. This news about Victoria and Brandon-what's going on? Victoria called me panicking."

"I have no fucking clue," Maya hissed. "This is a complete disaster.I certainly didn't leak this! Stark Entertainment hasn't issued any statement yet. You know this involves Brandon Stark himself-our goddamn boss. If
he decides to make this ugly, we're all screwed."

"Do you have any idea who might have done this?" I asked innocently.

"No idea. I need to go-my other line is blowing up. Talk later."

After hanging up. I took a deep breath and made the caIl I'd been waiting for.


"Mr. Wilson? It's Sophie."

James's voice was cold and professional. "Sophie. What can I help you with?"


"Have you seen today's news? About Brandon and Victoria?" I asked,injecting just the right amount of concern into my voice.

"I have." His tone sharpened. "What exactly is going on? How did Brandon's photos end up splashed across the media with Victoria?Anyone with eyes can see this was deliberate!"

I feigned shock. "Mr. Wilson, I swear this has nothing to do with me or Victoria! She called me this morning absolutely terrified. She'd never risk something like this-she's married to Alexander! This kind of scandal would destroy her more than help her."

"Terrified?" James scoffed. "You expect me to believe this wasn't orchestrated by you two? You have some nerve targeting Brandon Stark like this. Do you realize what he could do to you both if he wanted?"

"I promise you, we had nothing to do with this!" I insisted, my voice cracking with practiced desperation.

James paused, considering. "Perhaps she doesn't love Alexander. Maybe
she's using this scandal to break things off with him, aiming higher-at Brandon himself."

"That's ridiculous," I countered. "Victoria isn't that stupid. She knows Brandon would never-" I stopped myself before saying too much."I mean, she's just not that type of person."

"So who do you think is behind this, then?" James asked pointedly.

I hesitated, choosing my words carefully. "I honestly don't know,which is why I called you. I'm positive Victoria isn't involved, even though I... well,let's just say I wouldn't mind seeing her face some consequences for once."I paused. "Mr. Wilson, who do you think might want to hurt Brandon like this?"


There was a long silence on the other end.

"Sophie," James finally said, his voice measured, "you don't need to worry.Even if this turns out to be Victoria's doing, we won't hold you responsible.Just stay out of it for now. Where is Victoria currently?"

"She's traveling with Alexander, but catching a flight back today and landing at JFK at 3." I replied.

"Good. Keep her calm and out of trouble. The last thing we need is for her to make a statement or get caught by paparazzi in a compromising position. Tell her to lie low until this blows over."

"I understand," I assured him. "I'll make sure she doesn't do anything stupid."

After hanging up, I allowed myself a small smile of satisfaction. Little did James know, I'd already put the wheels in motion for phase two. Victoria's nightmare was just beginning, and I would be right there, playing the
supportive friend while watching her world crumble.

I texted Victoria:*Try to stay calm. Flight booked. Landing at JFK at 3.*

She quickly replied: *Of course. Thanks, Sophie.*

I glanced at the news articles again, admiring my handiwork. The photo had been perfect-intimate enough to suggest impropriety but professional enough to maintain plausible deniability. And James had fallen for it completely.

For months I'd wworked as Victoria's assistant, enduring her demands and tantrums, all while gaining access to the very people who could help me destroy her. Now I was perfectly positioned-trusted by Victoria,useful to James, and invisible enough that no one would suspect me of orchestrating any of it.

"Your move, Victoria," I whispered, closing my laptop with a satisfying click.
###Chapter 234: The Humiliation
Victoria's POV
The streets of Manhattan blurred past my window as we drove toward Stark Entertainment headquarters. Maya had arranged an elaborate decoy to throw off any paparazzi, but something went wrong. As soon as I stepped out of the car, a sea of cameras and shouting reporters surged forward, blocking the entrance.
"Ms. Taylor! Over here!"
"Can you comment on the scandal?"
The pressure was overwhelming. I tried to push through, but the crowd was too dense. Someone jostled my shoulder, and I lost my footing. I gasped as I tumbled to the ground, the rough pavement scraping against my palms. In the chaos, I felt the weight of the crowd pressing in on me, and I heard the sickening sound of my delicate silk blouse snagging and giving way at the shoulder.
Flashbulbs exploded in my face, capturing my every moment of distress. I felt utterly exposed, not just because of my disheveled appearance, but because of the predatory way the cameras lingered on my fall. Security finally reached me, pulling me up and shielding me from the relentless lenses, but the damage was done.
I hurried inside the building, my heart hammering against my ribs. Maya was waiting in the lobby, her face pale.
"Victoria! Are you okay?" she whispered, quickly draping her own coat over my trembling shoulders to hide the tear in my blouse.
"I'm fine," I snapped, though my voice shook. "Just get me to the meeting."
As we walked toward the elevator, I could still feel the phantom weight of the crowd and the sting of humiliation. I had spent years building my image, and in a matter of seconds, it had been dragged through the dirt. But as the elevator doors closed, my shame began to harden into a cold, sharp rage. Someone would pay for this.

###Chapter 235: I Think It's Elle Sinclair

**Sophie's POV**

"You know what?" Elizabeth's eyes lit up with that dangerous gleam I'd come to recognize. "This is actually perfect. We'll leak this information to Brandon. If Summer's behind this, he'll take care of her himself! We won't even need to lift a finger."

Victoria's face brightened at this suggestion. "You're right. Brandon would never let someone get away with using his name like this, especially not someone as insignificant as Summer."

I'd been quiet long enough. Their eagerness to condemn Summer without a single piece of evidence was getting on my nerves.

"Oh Sophie!" Victoria suddenly noticed me, as if she'd forgotten I was there. "Sorry. I was just..." she gestured vaguely, her voice trailing off.

"I get that you're upset," I said carefully, stepping forward. "Anyone would be after what happened at the airport. But I think we need to look at this logically before jumping to conclusions."

Victoria's brow furrowed. "What do you mean?"

"I mean," I continued, meeting her gaze directly, "that this doesn't feel like Summer's style. From everything I've seen and heard about her, she keeps to herself, focuses on her work. This kind of media manipulation? It's too...calculated."


I took a breath before delivering my actual advice. "I think you should hold off on approaching Brandon about this. His reactions are unpredictable at best. What if he thinks you're trying to drag him into
your drama?"

"What exactly are you suggesting?" Elizabeth cut in, her voice sharp enough to cut glass. "That my daughter should just sit back and take this abuse? Summer is clearly behind this! Who else would want to destroy Victoria's reputation and relationship with Alexander?"

Victoria shot her mother a warning look."Mom-"

"Mrs. Taylor," I interrupted firmly, forcing myself to remain professional despite my growing distaste. "I understand you're protective of Victoria.But please, let me finish."


Inside, I couldn't help but think how pathetic it was that this was Summer's family-people who didn't even try to understand her, who were so quick to vilify her at every turn. No wonder she'd distanced herself.

Elizabeth looked like she'd been slapped, but Victoria quickly intervened.

"Mom,let Sophie speak. She's been my rock through all of this." Victoria turned to me with genuine gratitude in her eyes. "If it weren't for Sophie helping me at the airport, I don't know what I would've done."

She then fixed me with a determined stare. "Sophie, I need you to find that photographer from the airport. He needs to pay for wwhat he did."

I nodded, making a mental note to follow up on that lead. "I'll handle it."

"Now," I continued, pulling the conversation back on track, "let's think about this rationally. Victoria, at the annual party, besides Summer,who else might have had it out for you? Who else might have wanted to see you taken down a peg?"

Victoria accepted the glass of water I handed her, taking a small sip as she
considered my question. After a moment, her eyes widened in realization.

"The Diana contract," she murmured. "That's what this is about. I beat out all the other girls for that spokesperson position."

"Exactly," I encouraged. "And who was most devastated by that announcement?"

"Bianca," Victoria answered immediately. "She was the front-runner before Brandon chose me. The others-Cleo and whatever her name was-they were never real contenders anywway."

I nodded, but kcnew we weren't quite there yet. "You're getting warmer.But there's someone else you're forgetting. Someone who might have been even more upset by all the attention you received that night."

Victoria stared at me blankly.

"Elle Sinclair," I prompted. "Remember how she completely lost it during your performance? How Brandon publicly humiliated her, then immediately announced you as Diana's new spokesperson? Don't you think she might have seen that as a deliberate slight?"

Elizabeth's perfectly arched eyebrows shot up. "Elle Sinclair? Who's that?"Her eyes narrowed as she worked through the name. "Wait, Sinclair...isn't she Brandon's cousin or something? Why would she target Victoria?"

I couldn't help but feel a small thrill of satisfaction as I watched the pieces click into place in Victoria's mind.

"Oh my God," Victoria breathed. "You're right. Elle Sinclair was furious that night." She looked at me with newfound respect. "Sophie, I don't know what I'd do without you. You're absolutely brilliant."
Her face fell slightly. "But even if it is her, what proof do we have? It's just speculation."

I sat down beside her on the plush sofa. "Elle Sinclair is dangerous,
Victoria. This attack was calculated and vicious-and I don't think she's done yet."

"What do you mean?" Victoria asked, tension evident in her voice.

"I've been watching her interactions with Brandon," I explained. "Her feelings for him go beyond normal family affection. It's almost... obsessive.The way she looks at him,follows him, tries to insert herself into his life.Honestly? I think she's mentally unstable."

Victoria's jaw set in·determination. "I refuse to be her punching bag. I don't care if she's a Sinclair. I've seen how Brandon looks at her-like she's something unpleasant he stepped in."

"That may be true," I conceded, "but Brandon isn't going to go after her without solid proof. She's still family, and Stark men protect their own."I paused for effect. "What we need is evidence. Something that proves beyond doubt that Elle orchestrated this whole thing. We need to make her reveal herself."


"And then what?" Victoria demanded.

"Then," I said with quiet confidence, "we demand that Stark Entertainment and Brandon personally make this right. They need to clear your name,publicly affirm your position with Diana, and ensure Elle faces consequences for her actions."

I leaned closer, my voice dropping to a conspiratorial tone. "In fact, if we play this right, this whole scandal might actually work in your favor."
Victoria looked at me like I'd lost my mind. "Are you insane? How could this possibly be a∗good∗thing? I've spent years building a respectable image, and now it's being dragged through the mud!"

I pulled out my tablet, swiping through several screens before turning it toward Victoria. "Look at these metrics. Your social media following has jumped by 15% since this morning. Your name is trending on every platform. People are talking about you, Victoria."

"As a slut who slept her way to the top!" she countered.

"For now." I agreed. "But narratives can be changed. The important thing is visibility, and right now, you've got everyone's attention. We just need to redirect it."

Elizabeth,who had been uncharacteristically quiet, suddenly nodded."Sophie's right. Victoria. This could be an opportunity if handled correctly."

I nearly did a double-take at Elizabeth's unexpected support. The woman had been glaring daggers at me just minutes earlier.


"The immediate priority is clearing your name and exposing Elle,"Elizabeth continued. "Dealing with Summer... well, that can wait."

Victoria looked between us, then let out a lóng sigh. "Fine. So what's our next move?"
###Chapter 236: Kill Two Birds With One Stone

**Summer's POV**

I sprawled across our living room sofa at the Hamptons estate, my head resting on Brandon's lap as evening settled around us. His fingers absently stroked my hair while he scrolled through his phone with his free hand.This peaceful moment was exactly what we needed after the chaos of the past few days.

Something felt off, though. Brandon's movements seemed oddly calculated,almost hesitant. The muscles beneath my head were too tense,and his breathing pattern wasn't quite right.

I cracked one eye open to find him staring down at me with an expression I couldn't quite decipher-that look he got when planning something complicated.


"You know," he began carefully, setting his phone aside, "there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about."

He watched me with that inscrutable expression. "Is there... anything you want to ask me about?"

I shifted to look up at him better, "What's going on with you today? You're acting weird."

I reached up and smoothed my fingers across his forehead,where a small crease had formed between his brows.

"Stop frowning," I murmured. "You'll get wrinkles, and then you'll look old before your time."

His mouth twitched upward, but his eyes remained serious. "Are you sure
there's nothing you want to ask me about? Something from today, perhaps?



I pushed myself up to a sitting position. "Brandon, what are you talking about? Should I be asking you something? Did you do something I don't know about?" I narrowed my eyes. "Something I wouldn't like?"

The way his expression tightened told me I'd hit the mark.

"Oh my God, you really did something, didn't you?"

Brandon reached for my hand.

"Wait," I cut him off, laying my palm against his cheek. "Whatever it is,as long as you didn't cheat on me or something, I'm not going to freak out.So just tell me what's going on."

"Have you checked the news today?" he asked quietly.

"The news?" I frowned. "No,why would I?"

"Check it now."

I reached for my phone. A quick search of Brandon's name was all it took-the headlines exploded across my screen:

**STARK AFFAIR: BILLIONAIRE CEO CAUGHT IN SECRET RELATIONSHIP WITH ACTRESS**


**BRANDON STARK'S ALLEGED AFFAIR WITH VICTORIA TAYLOR EXPOSED**


The accompanying photos showed Brandon and Victoria at the annual party, his hand on hers as he announced her as Diana's new spokesperson.
The angles made their interaction look intimate, secretive-nothing like
the professional exchange it had actually been.

I looked up, meeting Brandon's watchful gaze. It only took seconds to piece it together. This wasn't an accident or a paparazzi opportunity. This was deliberate.

I tossed my phone aside and crossed my arms. "I'm angry,"I declared,my tone deliberately dramatic. "Very, very angry. You'd better start explaining yourself right now!"

Brandon watched me silently, his expression cautious.

I couldn't maintain the facade. A smile tugged at my lips. "Oh, come on. I'm not actually mad. How could I be?"

"I don't believe a word of what those articles say," I continued, waving dismissively at my phone. "As if you would ever be interested in Victoria!First of all, she's married. But more importantly..." I leaned closer. "I know where I stand with you. I know that nobody else comes close."

Brandon's eyes warmed with approval.

"What I want to know," I said, poking his chest gently, "is why you did it."

His eyebrows shot up. "You knew?"

I rolled my eyes. "Brandon, who in New York has the guts to publish gossip about you without your permission? They'd have to have a death wish." I tilted my head. "This has your fingerprints all over it. You arranged the whole thing, didn't you?"

A slow smile spread across his face. "You're too smart for your own good.I was looking forward to watching you get jealous."
"Keep dreaming," I laughed. "So why did you do it? What's the real reason?"

"The Sinclair family is getting impatient. I needed to take action."

I processed this, the pieces falling into place. "Oh, I get it. You're using the gossip about you and Victoria to create problems and distract Elle Sinclair?You're turning her attention toward Victoria instead of me?"

"And?" Brandon prompted, clearly pleased with my quick understanding.

"And you're using Elle's reaction to deal with Victoria at the same time," I finished. "Killing two birds with one stone. Thats... actually kind of brilliant in a devious way."


"So you approve?"

"Well, it's not exactly gentlemanly to use two women against each other like this." I teased. "But when have you ever claimed to be a gentleman?"

"And what would Mrs. Stark suggest instead? Just let things be?"


I shook my head firmly. "No way. I think your plan is solid. I'm not the type to turn the other cheek. If you just keep taking hits without fighting back, all you get is more pain. Sometimes you have to protect yourself proactively."


"That kind of thinking is exactly why I was so determined to marry you."


"Still," I said, "there's something I don't understand. Why does Elle hate me so much? She ddn't even know who I was before the annual party."


"Don't you remember? You danced with me, Brandon reminded me. "You were my opening dance partner."
"So?"
"Elle Sinclair targets any woman who comes near me," he explained. "She's... not entirely stable when it comes to her feelings about me."

A realization dawned on me. "Wait, so the whole Diana spokesperson thing with Victoria... you planned that all along? You deliberately gave Victoria that contract knowing Elle would go after her?"

Brandon didn't deny it. "Elle thought she had the draw rigged. She switched the box so all the numbers inside were hers."

"What?" I gasped. "She did that?"

"She tried," Brandon corrected. "But I had Monica switch it back. Elle never had a chance."

I stared at him, torn between admiration and indignation. "So I was bait?You used me to make Elle jealous, and now you're using Victoria the same way?"

"Not bait," Brandon corrected, his thumb stroking my palm. "More like... a catalyst."

"Great," I huffed. "So thanks to your brilliant plan, I've got Elle Sinclair hating my guts for absolutely no reason. Meanwhile, you come out of this looking completely innocent. How is that fair?"

"Are you saying I need to make it up to you?" Brandon asked, his voice dropping to that dangerous tone that always made my pulse quicken.

"Absolutely," I declared. "You owe me big time for this."

"I've aIready given you my entire self," he murmured, leaning closer."Isn't
that enough?"

I scoffed. "That doesn't count! You were already mine to begin with."

"True." His eyes darkened. "I'll give you whatever you want, but first..." In one swift motion, he scooped me up and flipped our positions, pressing me down into the cushions with his weight above me. "I have business to do."

"Brandon!" I gasped, startled by the sudden movement. "Get off me! What are you doing?" I wriggled beneath him. "And what exactly do I owe you?I haven't done anything!"

His only answer was a slow, predatory smile that madë my breath catch in my throat.
###Chapter 237: Endless Ecstasy
Brandon's POV
Moonlight spilled across the living room sofa, casting a soft glow over Summer’s features. Even after the storms we had weathered, having her in my arms made the noise of the world—the corporate schemes, the family vendettas—fade into insignificance. I looked down at her, marveling at how someone so delicate could be the strongest anchor in my life.
She looked up at me, her eyes shimmering with a light that only I was allowed to see. I leaned down to capture her lips, pouring every ounce of my protectiveness and devotion into the kiss. As the air between us grew heavy with shared desire, the tension of the long day finally snapped, replaced by a profound and overwhelming need for closeness.
The distance between us vanished as we sought the comfort of each other's warmth. This wasn't just about the heat of the moment; it was a soul-deep connection, a refuge from the chaos outside. I felt the steady beat of her heart against mine, a grounding rhythm that filled the empty spaces within me. Every touch, every whispered word in the dark, reaffirmed the choice we had made to stand by each other against everything else.
In the stillness of the night, we gave ourselves over to the quiet intensity of our bond. It was a release of emotion, a mutual surrender that reaffirmed everything we were to each other. We moved with a familiarity that only years of deep affection could forge, finding a perfect harmony in the shadows of the room. Every movement was an unspoken vow of loyalty and love, until at last, the exhaustion of the day was replaced by a deep, lingering peace.
I held her long after the world went quiet, listening to the steady sound of her breathing. In the silence of our home, with her head resting on my chest, I realized that as long as I had her, I was finally, completely whole. The world could try to tear us apart, but in this space, we were invincible.

###Chapter 238: The Sinclairs Have Their Eyes on Me

Summer's POV
I woke up to the soft morning light filtering through the curtains of our bedroom. The steady, rhythmic warmth of Brandon’s arm draped over my waist was the most grounding feeling in the world. For a moment, I just lay there, listening to the quiet sounds of the Hamptons estate waking up outside our window.
Brandon stirred beside me, his grip tightening slightly as he pulled me back against his chest. I felt his breath, warm and steady, against the nape of my neck. After the intensity of the previous night, this quiet closeness felt even more precious.
"Good morning," he murmured, his voice husky with sleep.
"Morning," I replied, turning in his arms to face him.
His eyes were soft as they searched mine, his thumb tracing the line of my jaw with a tenderness that made my heart ache. There was no need for grand gestures or heated words; the simple reality of being in his space was enough. We stayed like that for a long time, drifting in the peaceful haze of the early hour, letting the strength of our bond recharge us for whatever the day had in store.
Eventually, the sun climbed higher, and the demands of our lives began to beckon. Brandon kissed my forehead before finally sitting up.
"I have a conference call at eight," he said, though he looked like he’d much rather stay in bed.
"And I have a million emails to catch up on," I laughed, reaching for my robe.
As we moved into our morning routine—the scent of fresh coffee, the quiet conversation about our schedules—the lingering sense of connection from the night before stayed with me. It was in these small, everyday moments that I realized how far we had come.
###Chapter 239: Moving Back

**Summer's POV**

I stacked the last report into my outbox and stretched my arms over my head,feeling my vertebrae crack pleasantly after being hunched over spreadsheets all day. The first workday after the Stark Group annual party had dragged on forever, filled with endless Manhattan West Side project revisions. All I wanted now was to get home, kick off my heels,and-

"Summer! Let's go shopping!"

Heather appeared in my doorway, practically vibrating with excitement, her designer handbag dangling from one wrist as she leaned against the frame.

I glanced up, already feeling the weight of everything I needed to deal with tonight. "Shopping? Where'd that come from?"

"Oh, come on," she wheedled, sweeping into my office and plopping down in the visitor's chair. "I haven't seen you in days. I need some retail therapy to reward myself for surviving the work day." Her eyes narrowed as she studied my outfit-a simple black pencil skirt paired with a cream silk blouse. "Seriously though, you always blow me off when I suggest shopping, but your clothes are amazing. Where do you even shop? And when? Do youI have some secret boutique connection I don't know about?"

I shrugged,avoiding her eyes. "Just picked it up somewhere. I don't make a big deal about shopping."

The truth clenched in my chest like a fist. Starting today, I couldn't go back to the Hamptons estate. Brandon and I needed distance. This whole secret marriage situation was becoming more painful by the day,making me feeI like I was living half a life. But with the tangled mess between the
Taylor. Stark, and Thompson families, what choice did we have?
"Whoa,what's that look for?" Heather leaned forward, concern creasing her brow. "You went all sad-puppy-eyes over a shopping conversation.What's going on?"

I forced myself to snap out of it, plastering on a smile that felt too tight."Nothing, it's fine. Shopping sounds good, actually. Let's hit Manhattan Mall. I need to pick up some stuff for my apartment anyway."

"Yes!" Heather bounced to her feet, beaming. "I'll grab my things. Meet you in the lobby in five?"

As she spun toward the door, my phone lit up with Brandon's name. My pulse quickened like it always did when he called, even after months of marriage.

"Hey," his deep voice rumbled through the line.

"Hi," I replied softly, feeling warmth spread through me despite everything.

"I'm sorry, June," he said, regret lacing his words. "We can't go home together tonight."

My stomach dropped. I glanced at Heather's retreating back,lowering my voice. "It's okay, I'll manage. Luckily I never gave up my apartment, so I'll just move back there temporarily. We can arrange to have my things sent over gradually. Don't worry-once this blows over, I'll come home."

"Damn it," he swore softly. "I hate this situation."

I couldn't help but smile at the frustration in his voice. "Trust me, I'm not thrilled either."
Silently. I added: *But this isn't the right time, Brandon. I want to be with you, spend my life with you. And that means eventually winning over your family, not antagonizing them further.*

"I know." he sighed, his voice softening. "Go ahead and get settled in."

"Actually, I'm going shopping first," I told him.

His tone instantly sharpened. "With who?"

"Just a coworker," I hastily explained. "You might remember her from the annual party-Heather? She was sitting next to me when Leo won that car.


Brandon's relief was almost palpable. "That's fine then. Have fun with your colleague. Buy whatever you need-you still have the card I gave you.right?"

"Yes, *dear*," I teased. "Don't worry, I'll be sure to max out your credit limit. Anything else?"

We said our goodbyes and hung up. When I looked up, Heather was standing right in front of my desk, nearly giving me a heart attack.

"Jesus Christ!" I gasped, clutching my chest. "Make some noise next time!"


A sly grin spread across Heather's face. "Jumpy much? Got a guilty conscience? Who was *that* on the phone? You were practically glowing-boyfriend alert!"


I rolled my eyes but couldn't hide my smile. "Fine, yes, it was my boyfriend. Happy now? I was just telling him I'm abandoning him tonight to hang out with you."
Heather squealed and flung her arms around me. "Aww, you do love me!Let's go blow some serious cash!"



Manhattan Mall was packed with after-work shoppers, but being only a few blocks from my old apartment made it the perfect choice.While Heather attacked the designer boutiques like she was on a mission, I stuck to the home goods stores, picking up essentials I'd need for my temporary living situation.

By the time we finished, Heather had somehow accumulated what looked like half the mall's inventory, and I ended up carrying three of her shopping bags along with my own purchases. Thank god I'd driven today.After dropping Heather off at her place, I headed toward the apartment I hadn't lived in for months.




"Miss Taylor? Is that really you?"

My landlady, was watering plants in the lobby when I staggered in with my bags. Her eyebrows shot up so high they nearly disappeared into her hairline.


"I didn't expect to see you back!" She gave me a once-over, her eyes gleaming with curiosity. "Are you... moving back in? Trouble with the boyfriend?"


Though she'd never met Brandon, she had definitely noticed the black town cars that occasionally dropped me off, the expensive gifts that sometimes arrived, and drawn her own conclusions about who I was dating.
Too tired to think of a better explanation, I just nodded. "Yeah, I kept paying rent just in case. Looks like that was a good call."

Her face immediately transformed into a mask of sympathetic outrage. "Oh,honey. Men are such trash these days. Don't you worry-there are plenty of fish in the sea! A pretty young thing like you will findsomeone better in no time."

I blinked. suddenly realizing what she was assuming. "No, Mrs. Henderson,you've got it wrong. We didn't break up. It's just... complicated right now.This is temporary."

She patted my arm, clearly not buying it. "Sure, sure. No need to puton a brave face with me. Look at all these bags-let me help you up with those.



"Really, I'm fine," I insisted, backing toward the elevator. "It's late and I'm sure you want to get to bed. I can manage."

After finally convincing her I didn't need a shoulder to cry on, I escaped to my apartment. I fumbled with the keys, juggling shopping bags while trying to remember which one opened the door.

Finally, I got the door open and stepped inside-then froze in my tracks.

I blinked, looking left and right, certain I'd somehow entered the wrong apartment. This couldn't possibly be the place I'd left behind months ago when I moved in with Brandon.
###Chapter 240: Brandon!

**Summer's POV**

Gone was the basic, minimalist decor I'd left behind months ago-the IKEA furniture, the sparse decorations, the general air of a place that was lived in but not quite loved.

In its place was... something else entirely. Something warm.Inviting.*Beautiful*.

The walls had been repainted in a soft cream instead of stark white.My old threadbare sofa had been replaced with a plush sectional in warm gray,accented with throw pillows in varying shades of blue. The rickety coffee table was gone, swapped for a sleek wooden piece that matched the new end tables. Even the lighting had been upgraded-the harsh overhead fixture replaced with recessed lighting and stylish lamps that cast a warm glow throughout the space.

I stepped inside cautiously, like I was entering a stranger's home. The kitchen had new appliances gleaming under cabinet lights that definitely hadn't been there before. My fingers traced the cool marble of countertops that had once been cheap laminate.

"What the hell?" I whispered to myself, moving deeper into the apartment.

The bedroom had been transformed too-a king-sized bed with an upholstered headboard had replaced my old full, and the bedding looked like something from a luxury hotel. Thebathroom sparkled with new fixtures, and plush towels hung from a warming rackI definitely hadn't installed.

As I stood gaping at the transformation, my phone rang. Brandon's name
flashed on the screen.

"Hey," I answered, still looking around in disbelief.

"You home yet?" His deep voice filled my ear, instantly making my chest ache with how much I missed him already.

"Yeah, just got to the apartment, but... Brandon, did you have someone come renovate?" I asked, sinking onto the new sofa. It was even more comfortable than it looked.

"Mmm. Do you like it?" He sounded almost hesitant, which was so unlike him it made me smile.

"Like it? It's... it's incredible." I ran my hand over the soft fabric of the sofa. "When did you even do this?"

"It was rushed. I had James find people to handle it. Wasn't sure how it would turn out."

I laughed,shaking my head even though he couldn't see me. "Don't worry,it's perfect. I was thinking I'd be up half the night getting things organized, but everything's ready to go!"

"James knows what he's doing. You still doubting that?"

"Never again," I promised, looking around the transformed space."Seriously, this place looks like it belongs in a magazine now."

"Good. As long as you like it."

I opened my mouth to respond, but suddenly the reality of the situation hit me like a punch to the gut. This beautiful apartment-it was just a temporary solution. A place to hide out until the storm around us calmed.
Chape-

Not our home together.

"Brandon," I said, my voice suddenly thick.

"What's wrong?" His tone sharpened immediately.

When I didn't answer right away, his concern deepened. "June, what is it?"

"Nothing," I lied, swallowing hard. "Everything's great here. Are you back at the Hamptons yet?"

"Yeah."

A pause, then his voice softened. "Missing me already?"

"No!" I shot back automatically, then immediately regretted it. "Well...what about you? Do you miss me?"

"Every second.," he replied without hesitation. "I miss you every moment we're apart. If I could, I'd be there with you right now."

My eyes burned with unexpected tears. "I miss you too. I was lying before-I miss you so much it huarts. I hate being away from you, even for one night."

"That's my girl," he murmured, his voice a caress.

I sniffled, embarrassed by how emotional I was being. "Anyway, since you're at the estate and I'm all settled in here, you can stop worrying. I just got back from shopping, and I really need a shower."

"Go ahead," he said softly.

"Get some rest, okay? Goodnight, Brandon."
"Goodnight,June."
I ended the call and sat there for a long moment, clutching the phone to my chest like it was a lifeline connecting me to him.



The hot spray of the shower helped wash away some of the tension in my shoulders, but not the hollow feeling in my chest. After thirty minutes of letting the water pound against my skin, I finally stepped out, wrapped myself in one of the impossibly soft new towels, and padded back to the bedroom.

Once my hair was dry, I wandered restlessly into theliving room.The beautiful new space suddenly felt too quiet, too empty. I clicked on the TV,flipping aimlessly through channels before giving up and turning it off again.

What was wrong with me? When Alexander had betrayed me with Victoria,
I'd handled it with a level of composure that had surprised even me.I'd picked myself up and moved on without falling apart. Yet here I was, one night away from Brandon, and I was acting like a lovesick teenager.

With a sigh, I retreated to the bedroom, crawling under the luxurious new comforter. Despite the premium bedding, I found myself shivering. New York winters were brutal, and without Brandon's body heat wrapped around me like it was every night at the Hamptons estate, I felt the chill deep in my bones.

I pulled out my phone, opening WhatsApp and staring at Brandon's profile picture. My finger hovered over it, tempted to call or message him again. But what would I say? *Hey, it's been an hour and I still miss you?*God, that would be pathetic.
I closed the app. Then opened it again. Closed it. Opened it.

This ridiculous cycle continued for over an hour as I argued with myself about whether to contact him. What had happened to the independent woman who'd taken New York by storm? The woman who'd rebuilt her life after betrayal and never looked back?

Apparently, she'd been replaced by this needy version of myself that I barely recognized.

Just as I was about to give in and call Brandon, a noise from the front of the apartment made me freeze. It sounded like... the lock turning?

My heart hammered against my ribs as I slid out of bed, adrenaline flooding my system. Who could possibly have a key? Had Elle Sinclair somehow tracked me here? Or worse-had she sent someone after me?

I grabbed the first potential weapon I could find-a pair of scissors from the dresser-and clutched my phone in my other hand,ready to call 911.My bare feet silent against the floor, I crept toward the bedroom door,listening as the front door opened.

Heavy footsteps crossed the threshold. Definitely not a woman's. I raised the scissors higher, prepared to defend myself if necessary.

Then a familiar silhouette appeared in the doorway, and the scissors clattered to the floor.


"Brandon!" I cried, relief and joy flooding through me in equal measure.

He stood there in the doorway, looking exactly like he had when I'd left him this morning-impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, his dark hair slightly tousled, his expression unreadable until his eyes met mine.
And then he smiled-that rare, genuine smile that transformed his entire face and was reserved only for me.
###Chapter 241: Goodnight

Summer's POV
I launched myself into his arms before he could even close the door behind him.
He caught me effortlessly, his strong arms wrapping around my waist as I buried my face in his neck, breathing in the familiar scent of him. I couldn't stop holding him—his shoulders, his chest—needing to confirm he was really here and not just a product of my lonely imagination.
"Hey, hey," he murmured, his hand stroking my hair. "I'm here. It's not a dream."
"I know," I whispered, feeling the solid warmth of him. "I can feel you now." I pulled back just enough to look at his face. His suit was pristine, and he didn't look like a man who had just spent hours on a cold winter highway. "How long have you been here? You’re not even cold."
The corners of his eyes crinkled with amusement. "What's wrong? Not happy to see me?"
"Don't be ridiculous," I said, clinging tighter. "I'm beyond happy. It's just so late, and..." Reality crashed back. "Wait, didn't you say the Sinclairs had people following me? What if they saw you?"
"They won't know I'm here," Brandon said, his voice calm and certain. "Don't worry about it. I'm not leaving you tonight." His hands settled on my waist, giving a gentle, reassuring squeeze.
I took a deep breath, gathering my courage, then stepped back and squared my shoulders, trying to look stern despite my racing heart. "Let's get one thing straight—this is my apartment now. You don't just get to waltz in and out whenever you feel like it. While you're under this roof, you follow my rules. Got it?"
Brandon's eyes darkened with a playful, intense heat. "Got it."
He caught my hand, bringing it to his lips and pressing a soft kiss to my knuckles. "Whatever you command."
A thrill shot through me, but I maintained my expression. "Good. Now tell me the truth—what exactly are you doing here in the middle of the night?"
"You really don't know?" Brandon's voice dropped to a low, magnetic register.
He stepped closer, his presence suddenly overwhelming. He didn't need to say anything more; the intensity in his dark eyes said it all. He had come because he couldn't stand being apart any more than I could.
Hours later, the apartment was silent, the golden light of the bedside lamp casting long shadows across the room. I settled against his chest, listening to the steady, grounding beat of his heart.
"I'm not going anywhere," he whispered into the darkness, his fingers intertwining with mine.
"I know," I replied, my voice soft with contentment. The fear and loneliness of the evening had vanished, replaced by the profound safety of his arms. As I drifted off to sleep, I knew that no matter what storms the Sinclairs or the media brewed outside, as long as he was here, we could handle anything.
###Chapter 242: If Only Victoria Had Married
Br andon Instead

**Richard's POV**
For the past two weeks, our home had become a sanctuary-no,more like a prison-for Victoria. My elder daughter, usually so vibrant and full of life, had been reduced to a shadow of herself, barely leaving her room except for meals.

I tried to focus on the financial section of my newspaper, but Elizabeth's incessant pacing was driving me insane.

"For God's sake, Elizabeth," I finally snapped, folding my newspaper with more force than necessary. "What exactly are you trying to accomplish with all this pacing? You're making my head spin."

Elizabeth whirled around, her perfectly highlighted hair swinging with the motion. Her eyes flashed with that familiar fire-the same fire that had attracted me to her decades ago, but now mostly just exhausted me.

"What am I doing?" she shot back, her voice rising with each word. "What do you*think* I'm doing, Richard? Are you seriously asking me that? Our daughter is upstairs wasting away while you sit there reading about stock prices!"

I rubbed my temples, feeling a headache building. "Lower your voice.
Victoria's probably trying to rest."

"Rest?" Elizabeth scoffed. "She hasn't left this house in two weeks! Have you even looked at what they're saying about her online? The comments,the memes-it's vicious, Richard. When has our daughter ever had to deal with something like this?"
I sighed heavily, tossing the newspaper aside. "And what exactly would you like me to do about it? Wave a magic wand? Capital Corp doesn't exactly have entertainment industry connections. And in case you've forgotten. we're taking hits too. I've been at the office until midnight every day this week trying to do damage control with our investors."
I loosened my tie. suddenly feeling constricted. "We don't even know who's behind this whole mess. Victoria signed with Stark Entertainment, didn't she? Why aren't they handling this? And what about Brandon Stark?He seemed fine at the wedding. I thought we were on good terms."

Something in my words made Elizabeth pause her pacing, her eyes narrowing thoughtfully. I recognized that look-it was the same expression she wore whenever she was plotting something.

"The wedding," she murmured, almost to herself. "Yes, Brandon Stark was there,wasn't he?"

"What?" I demanded. "What are you thinking now?"

She startled, as if she'd forgotten I was there. "I-nothing."


"Elizabeth..." I warned.

She sank onto the sofa beside me, suddenly animated. "I was just thinking... wouldn't it have been perfect if Victoria had married Brandon Stark instead of Alexander? They're not even in the same league! Brandon is the *actual* head of Stark Group-not just some middle manager playing at importance. He'll eventually control the entire Stark family fortune.Alexander's just...what? A department head and distant relative of in the Stark family?"

I stared at her, unable to believe what I was hearing. "Are you seriously
suggesting-"
"I'm just saying," Elizabeth continued, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, "if these rumors about Victoria and Brandon have any truth to them..."
"Stop right there!" I slammed my hand on the armrest, making her jump."I can't believe you'd even entertain such a thought! Are you actually hoping our daughter was having an affair with her boss while married to another man?"

Elizabeth had the decency to look slightly abashed, but the calculating gleam never left her eyes.

"Do you have any idea what you're suggesting?" I continued, barely controling my anger. "You think becoming the mistress of the Stark heir is something to aspire to? The Stark family matriarch isn't a position just anyone can fill! They have standards, Elizabeth-old money standards.Victoria's been married before, she's an actress, for Christ's sake. You think the Stark family would ever accept her?"

Elizabeth opened her mouth to protest, but something in my expression must have warned her off. I rarely put my foot down with her, but this was too much.

"I don't want to hear another word about this," I said firmly. "Not one word. If there's even a hint of truth to these rumors, Victoria's reputation is already damaged beyond repair. Don't make it worse with your scheming."

Elizabeth crossed her arms, the picture of wounded dignity. "Well, I was just thinking-"
"Don't," I cut her off. "Just don't. I've had those thoughts too,you know-back when Victoria first started at Stark Group. If she hadn't been engaged to Alexander, maybe... but that ship has sailed, Elizabeth. It's too late for what-ifs."

We sat in tense silence for a moment, the only sound the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner.

"What we *should* be focusing on," I said finally, "is who's behind this mess and why they're targeting Victoria and Brandon."

Elizabeth's eyes lit up as she seized on this new direction. "You're right!Brandon Stark is practically royalty in New York. Who would dare to cross him so publicly? It has to be someone either powerful enough to challenge him or someone with a personal vendetta."

I nodded, relieved to be on safer ground. "Exactly."

"You know," Elizabeth said slowly, "Victoria was talking to Sophie the other day, and they told me something interesting about the Sinclair family.



"The Sinclairs?" I raised an eyebrow. "Brandon's mother's family?"

Elizabeth nodded eagerly. "Apparently, there's this girl-Elle Sinclair. She's not actually Jane Sinclair's daughter. She's the daughter of Jane's first love."

"What?" I sat up straighter. "How do you know all this?"

"I've been doing somne digging," Elizabeth admitted. "After everything that s happened, I wanted to know who we're dealing with. This Elle Sinclair has been in love with Brandon since childhood, but he's never shown any interest in her."
"Go on," I encouraged, now genuinely intrigued.

"Here's where it gets bizarre," Elizabeth leaned forward, her voice dropping conspiratorially. "Jane Sinclair treats this girl like her own daughter-which makes sense for her brother, since it's his first love's child,but for Jane? It's strange. And get this-she actively helps Elle try to trap Brandon!"

"What do you mean?"

"A few years back, when Brandon was in Washington," Elizabeth continued, her eyes gleaming with the thrill of gossip, "Jane apparently drugged her own son, then sent Elle to his bed. Can you believe that?"

My jaw dropped. "You're kidding. Did it work?"
###Chapter 243: Calculated Moves


**Richard's POV**
"How could that be possible?" Elizabeth continued, her eyes gleaming with the excitement of scandalous gossip. "Brandon threw Elle out on the spot.He left town right after. But then the Sinclairs latched onto Brandon like parasites, insisting he had forced himself on Elle and demanding he 'make things right.' Even Jane sided with Elle. Brandon made his position crystal clear-he would never marry Elle, and he banned Jane from returning to New York."

"Wow," I said, genuinely surprised. "I had absolutely no idea about any of this."

I leaned back in my armchair, processing this information. Whatever happened in Washington DC stayed in Washington DC-especially when it involved one of New York's most powerful families.

"The Stark family would never let news like that leak," I reasoned. "They've got too much influence in this city. Not a single newspaper would dare touch that story without their blessing."

Elizabeth nodded eagerly. "But here's the kicker-the Sinclair family actually threw an engagement party for Elle without Brandon even being there! That's why she stll calls herself Brandon's fiancée to this day."

Her eyes widened. "So it must be Elle behind all this! She's spreading these rumors about Victoria and Brandon to get back at him!"


I shook my head, always the more pragmatic of the two of us. "Not necessarily. Elle alone doesn't have that kind of power. She's just one person."
"Think about it," I prompted. "Who's Elle's guardian? Who would be bold enough to release this kind of information, smearing Victoria while Brandon stands by and does nothing? Besides the Sinclair family,who else could it possibly be?"
The reality of the situation slowly registered on Elizabeth's face.

"Those Sinclairs have gone too far this time," Elizabeth hissed, rising to her feet in indignation. "This is between them and the Starks-what does Victoria have to do with any of it? Why drag our daughter into their family drama?"

She paced the room, her designer heels clicking rhythmically against the hardwood floor. "I won't let them get away with this. I don't care about their Washington connections! Nobody hurts my. Victoria and gets away with it!"

I sighed, pinching the bridge of my nose. "Elizabeth, calm down. Don't be rash. Unless we have absolutely no other choice, we shouldn't make enemies of the Sinclair family."

I lowered my voice. "Look, even Brandon hasn't moved against them yet.That tells me he's still concerned about maintaining the Sinclair family's reputation. If you go after them now, you're practically declaring war-not just on the Sinclairs, but potentially on Brandon too."

Elizabeth whirled around, her eyes flashing, "So what exactly are you suggesting? That Victoria should just continue suffering this online harassment? That we should just sit back and watch our daughter's reputation get dragged through the mud?"

"You make a fair point," I conceded. "But for Victoria's future, we need to be strategic, not impulsive." I paused. "Don't forget that George and
Brandon have a good relationship. We need to consider that angle."

At the mention of my father. Elizabeth's expression shifted.

"You're right," she said finally. "We should talk to George first,see if he can give us insight into Brandon's position. Maybe he could even persuade Brandon to help Victoria clear her name."
She sat down again, smoothing her skirt. "Anad if that doesn't work...well,we'll have to resort to more drastic measures."

"What kind of drastic measures?" I asked warily.

A cold smile spread across Elizabeth's face. "Exposing Elle's family mental health history.'

I raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself.

"You probably don't know this," Elizabeth continued, leaning forward."But years ago, when the Sinclair patriarch was about to marry his first love-Elle's mother-she had a psychotic break right in the Sinclair family home. She bit one of the Sinclair elders and attacked an old lady. Complete psychotic meltdown."

Elizabeth's eyes gleamed with malicious sațisfaction. "The Sinclairs were horrified. Even though she supposedly got better later, they couldn't risk bringing someone with that kind of.., genetic predisposition into their bloodline."


"Are you suggesting Elle inherited her mother's condition?" I asked carefully.


"Absolutely," Elizabeth replied without hesitation. "Her obsession with Brandon is pathological! The way she's fixated on him? It's not normal. It'
s downright disturbing."
I considered this information carefully. If true, it was certainly powerful ammunition. But using it would be like detonating a nuclear bomb in New York high society.
"Put that information aside for now," I advised. "Only if we have absolutely no other options should we even consider using it."

I stood up, straightening my tie. "I'll talk to George myself."

"Fine," Elizabeth agreed, though I could tell she wasn't entirely pleased with my restraint.

\---

My father's private study had always intimidated me, even as a grown man. The dark wood paneling, the imposing bookshelves, and the ever-present scent of expensive cigars created an atmosphere of old money and quiet power.

"You wanted to see me?" he asked without looking up from his desk.

"Father, I've come to talk about Victoria," I began.

"Victoria?" he said, finally raising his eyes to meet mine. "I've heard about her recent troubles. I may be old, Richard, but I'm not blind.She-"

"Father," I interrupted hastily, "Victoria might be a bit spoiled, but she's good at heart. Besides, she's married to Alexander-how could she possibly be involved with Brandon?"

George leaned back in his chair, studying me with those penetrating eyes that seemed to miss nothing. "I hadn't even finished my thought, and here
you are, already defending her. Richard, have you ever asked yourself why,though Victoria and Summer are both my granddaughters, I've always favored Summer and shown little affection for Victoria?"

I shifted uncomfortably under his gaze.

"You know why," he continued. "Deep down, you know exactly why.But I won't belabor the point. Whether Victoria is at fault here or not, I don't particularly care to know. Since you've come to me, why don't you tell me exactly what you want?"

I swallowed hard, feeling the weight of old family sins pressing down on me. "I came to ask for your help. You have a good relationship with Brandon, don't you? Could you ask him to clarify the situation publicly? It would only take a single statement from him to put an end to all this.Victoria is still building her career in entertainment-it's a cutthroat industry as it is, without these false accusations. And now Capital Corp is taking hits too. Father-"

"Enough," George raised his hand, silencing me. "I understand what you're asking. Yes, I do have some connection with Brandon. Whether that connection is strong enough to help you... that remains to be seen."

"If you could just try," I pressed. "If it doesn't work, I'll find another way."
###Chapter 244: Behind the Scenes


**Brandon's POV**
The flickering light from the television cast a soft glow across the living room of Summer's Manhattan apartment. I watched her more than the screen.taking in her profile as she laughed at something on the TV.These moments of normalcy had become precious since our temporary separation.

My phone vibrated on the coffee table, and Summer's eyes immediately darted to the screen. Her eyebrows shot up.

"Grandpa George?" she said, surprised. "Why would he be calling this late?



I picked up the phone, turning down the TV volume with my other hand.Summer leaned closer, her warmth against my side as comforting as it was distracting.

"Hello, George," I answered, keeping my tone neutral despite my curiosity.

"Brandon, you and Summer sleeping yet?" George's gruff voice came through clearly.

"No,we're watching TV," I replied, then paused. "Is there something urgent?"

"Nothing too pressing," George sighed. "It's about Victoria. Her father came to see me today. Since they saw how close we were at the Stark Group annual party, he thought he could get information from me..."

I could hear the hesitation in his voice,the careful way he was choosing his words. George Taylor might be in his seventies, but his mind was as sharp as ever.
"Brandon, I need to ask you something, and I want an honest answer," he said finally.

"Go ahead." I replied,already knowing what was coming.

"Is there anything between you and Victoria?" The question hung in the air,loaded with implications.
"No." I stated firmly. "Is that what you're asking? If V/ictoria and I have some kind of relationship? My answer is no. You should know that Summer is my wife."

George sighed heavily on the other end. "I thought as much. I didn't really suspect otherwise. It's just that this situation has blown up so much. It's not just affecting Victoria, but you as well..."

"I understand your concern," I said, glancing at Summer. She nodded,gesturing for the phone. "Summer wants to speak with you."

I handed her the phone, watching as her face softened at the sound of her grandfather's voice.

"Grandpa, it's me!" she exclaimed, her entire demeanor brightening.

I could only hear her side of the conversation, but it was enough to follow along.

"I'm doing great, Grandpa... No, please don't get involved. Brandon will handle everything..."

She caught my eye, her expression growing more serious.

"Brandon and Victoria have absolutely nothing going on. This is just someone trying to cause trouble. It's complicated to explain right now..."
She paused, listening. "Don't worry, I promise I won't get the short end of this."

Another pause.

"I understand, Grandpa. Victoria's caught in the middle too. I know."

She said her goodbyes and hung up, turning to me with a heavy sigh.

"It's up to you now," she said, handing back my phone.

"Tll handle it," I promised, feeling a twinge of guilt. "I'm sorry you're dealing with this."

Summer shook her head, a small smile playing on her lips. "I'm not bothered!"

She pushed off my chest and surveyed the apartment. It was nice--I'd made sure of that-but it wasn't our Hamptons estate. The comparison was impossible to ignore.

Though she hadn't admitted it, I knew the move had bothered her initially.But I'd been coming here every night without fail, undetected by Jane Sinclair's watchers. We'd maintained our routine, found a new normal within these walls.

"If Dad went to Grandpa, it means they're running out of options,"Summer mused aloud. "Do you think they know this is connected to the Sinclair family? To Elle Sinclair?"

"They do," I replied without hesitation.

Summer's eyes widened. "How can you be so sure?"

I chuckled, reaching out to brush my finger across the tip of her nose."
Elizabeth hired a private investigator to look into Elle Sinclair. That's why she hasn't had time to come after you."
"My mother?" Summer's confusion was evident. "But she doesn't even know Elle. Why would she suddenly investigate her?"
Summer studied my face, her brow furrowing before comprehension dawned. "Wait a minute. Don't tell me you orchestrated all of this! But how did you know my mother would investigate Elle Sinclair?"

I felt a smirk tugging at my lips as I pulled her into my arms. "I have my ways."

"Oh, keeping secrets from me now?" Summer raised an eyebrow, but didn't press further.

She knew me well enough to understand that I'd mapped out every contingency, every possible reaction. Elizabeth's investigation was just one piece of a much larger puzzle I'd been assembling.

Later, as we settled back on the couch, I couldn't help but feel a need to apologize again.

"I'm sorry you have to stay here for now," I murmured against her hair.

Summer groaned. "I get it. You've said that like eight hundred times already. I'm sick of hearing it!"

She nestled closer, her head resting against my chest. Her eyelids were already drooping despite her insistence on finishing the show.

"Tired?" I asked, adjusting our position to make her more comfortable."Ready for bed?"
Cap
"No, let's finish this episode," she mumbled. "It's almost over."

I didn't bother arguing, just held her as her breathing gradually slowed and deepened. Within minutes, she was fast asleep, her face peaceful in a way that made my chest tighten.

Carefully, I lifted her into my arms, carrying her to the bedroom.I undressed her with practiced efficiency, tucking her under the covers before sliding in beside her. My body curled protectively around hers,warming the cool sheets.

Once the bed was warm and Summer was deeply asleep, I slipped away,retrieving my phone from the living room.

James answered on the first ring, any traces of sleep instantly gone from his voice.

"Mr. Stark," he said.

"How are we progressing?" I asked without preamble.

"Just as you predicted. Elizabeth has uncovered nearly everything about the Sinclair family. She has all the information she needs-well,everything except their most deeply buried secrets."

I could hear the admiration ina James's voice. He was impressed that I'd anticipated Elizabeth's moves so precisely, engineering the situation so that she would gain access to information she'd never have found on her own.

"What's our next step, sir?" James asked.

I leaned against the doorframe, my eyes drifting to the black sedan parked below. Jane's watchers were nothing if not predictable.
"Have Victoria come to the office tomorrow," I instructed. "We need to start shooting the Diana advertisement. And give her the supporting actress role in that film project."
"I'll notify Maya tomorrow," James replied, though I could hear his reservations. "Though giving Victoria that role seems... generous. It's quite an opportunity."

I understood his reluctance. The film had been years in the making-a passion project with top writers and directors. James believed it would be a box office hit, and I agreed. But its value to me went beyond mere profits.

"You have to sacrifice a pawn to catch a wolf," I explained. "The higher I elevate Victoria, the more vicious their fight becomes. I want both the Sinclair family and the Taylor family fully invested in this game. That's when it gets interesting."

I smiled to myself, already seeing the pieces falling into place. "When is the film press conference scheduled?"

"Soon, sir. We planned to announce it before the holidays and begin production afterward. Will that timing work for you?"

"Perfect," I confirmed. "I'll be attending the press conference personally."
###Chapter 245: Good News

**Victoria's POV**

"For God's sake, Maya, do you have any idea what time it is?" I growled into my phone, not bothering to hide the irritation in my voice.The digital clock on my nightstand glared 11:47 PM-practically midnight. "Unless someone's dying, this had better be important."
"It is." Maya assured me, her voice uncharacteristically excited. "Victoria, I've got news.Big news."

I sat up in bed, suddenly alert. "What kind of news?"

"Two pieces, actually. First, the Diana spokesperson contract is still yours.Second-and this is huge-you've been cast as the supporting actress in'Midnight Echo!"

My heart stopped. "What? Are you serious?"

"Dead serious. James Wilson himself called me not thirty minutes ago. The Diana photoshoot starts the day after tomorrow, and film prep begins next week."

I couldn't process what I was hearing. For two weeks I'd been practically a recluse, hiding in my parents' house while my reputation was dragged through the mud. Alexander hadn't returned a single one of my calls. My career had seemed all but over.


And now...this?

"That's... that's incredible," I managed, my voice barely above a whisper."But how? Why now?"
"I have no idea," Maya admitted. "All I know is that James called personally to confirm both opportunities, and he wants me to send a car to pick you up tomorrow morning."

"Wait-tomorrow? What's happening tomorrow?"

"Contract signing, preliminary fittings, the works. Victoria,this is it-your comeback. They're treating you like royalty!"

After hanging up, I was too wired to sleep. I paced my bedroom, mind racing with possibilities.

Two weeks ago. I'd been branded a homewrecker, my relationship with Alexander on the rocks, my career in tatters. An'd now, overnight,everything was turning around.

Was this Brandon's doing? Had to be. No one else had that kind of power.But why would he help me after that tabloid disaster?

It was nearly 3 AM before I finally collapsed into bed,exhaustion overtaking excitement.


\---

The streets of Manhatan blurred past my.window as we drove toward Stark Entertainment headquarters. Maya had arranged an elaborate decoy to throw off any paparazzi-another car had picked up a woman of similar build at my parents' house, leading photographers on a wildI goose chase across the city while I was safely escorted through a private entrance.

"Ingenious plan," I complimented Maya as we walked throughthe building's pristine lobby.

"Just doing my job," she replied with a satisfied smirk. "Now focus. James
Wilson is waiting for us upstairs, and you know how he hates to be kept waiting."
James was already seated in the conference room when we arrived,looking exactly as I remembered him-impeccably dressed, expression neutral,posture perfect. He nodded at our entrance, gesturing to the seats across from him.
"Ms. Taylor," he greeted me formally. "It's good to see you looking well."

"Thank you for arranging this meeting," I replied, matching his professional tone. "I understand I have some contracts to sign?"

James slid a folder across the table. "The Diana spokesperson contract.Brandon had this prepared immediately after the annual party, but given the... unfortunate events that followed, he decided to hold off temporarily."

I flushed with embarrassment. "Mr. Wilson, I want you to know I had absolutely nothing to do with those stories. I would never do something like that-I'm married, for God's sake! It wouldn't benefit me at all!"

"Naturally," James replied smoothly. "Otherwise, I wouldn't be sitting here with you today."

I carefully reviewed the contract-the terms were even better than I'd anticipated. Not only would I be the face of Diana throughout North America, but the contract included bonuses for international exposure.

"This looks excellent," I said, signing with a flourish. "Please convey my thanks to Brandon...I mean, Mr.Stark."

"I will," James assured me. "Now, about the film role. Quinn Hall and Thomas White should be joining us shortly to discuss details."
Right on cue, the conference room door opened, admitting Quinn and Thomas. Quinn looked surprised to see me, while Thomas's expression remained impassive.
"Quinn. Thomas!" I greeted them warmly. "It's wonderful to see you both."

Quinn returned my greeting with professional courtesy, though I could tell she was thrown by my presence. Thomas merely nodded.
"As you know," James began, addressing the room at large, "Ms. Taylor has been selected for the supporting role in 'Midnight Echo.' Brandon believes her talents are perfectly suited for the character."

I straightened in my chair, pride washing over me. Brandon himself had chosen me for this role!

James continued, "Quinn, Thomas, I'll leave the creative specifics to you.The contract details are already settled."

The meeting concluded efficiently, with Thomas outlining my character and the shooting schedule. As Maya and I left the conference room,I could hardly contain my excitement.

"I can't believe this is happening," I whispered, once we were alone in the elevator. "Two weeks ago, I thought my career was over."

Maya grinned. "Victoria, this isn't just damage control-this is a promotion.
You're not just surviving this scandal; you're going to come out of it more
famous than ever."

I considered this, a slow smile spreading across my face. "You're right.I need to use this moment. The Diana photoshoot will be all over the media."
"Exactly," Maya nodded. "But first, let's get you home. You need to rest and prepare-we have a nutrition consultation this afternoon, and your skin needs serious attention after being cooped up for two weeks."
Two days later, I arrived at the Diana photoshoot location to find a crowd of reporters and fans gathered outside. Somehow, news of my photoshoot had leaked,drawing attention from every major entertainment outlet in the city.

"Ms. Taylor! Victoria! Over here!" They called as I stepped out of the car,cameras flashing like strobe lights. "Can you comment on your relationship with Brandon Stark?"

"How did you secure the Diana contract during your scandal?"

I smiled enigmatically but didn't answer, letting the security team guide me through the throng and into the building. Once inside, I took a deep breath,collecting myself.

If the rumors about Brandon and me were helping my career rather than hurting it, maybe I should just embrace them? After al1,Brandon himself didn't seem bothered by the gossip anymore.

The photoshoot set was breathtaking-a minimalist white space transformed into an ethereal dreamscape. The French photographer, world-renowned for his work with luxury brands, was adjusting equipment when I emerged from makeup.

"Ah, Ms. Taylor," he greeted me with a slight accent. "You look perfect.Shall we begin?"


I stepped in front of the camera, feeling a surge of confidence. Whatever force had tried to destroy me had failed spectacularly. Instead of fading
into obscurity, I was about to become more famous than ever.

As the camera began clicking, I gave the lens my most dazzling smile. This wasn't just a comeback-it was a rebirth.
###Chapter 246:Arguments

**Victoria's POV*

The bright lights of the studio burned into my retinas as I held the final pose. My jaw ached from smiling for hours, but I maintained my position without flinching.

"Cut! That's a wrap," Thomas White barked, finally lowering his camera.His perpetually furrowed brow relaxed slightly. "These will do. Ms. Taylor,you're free to go."


Coming from Thomas, that was practically a standing ovation. I exhaled slowly, letting the tension drain from mny shoulders as the assistants dismantled the set.

Twenty minutes later, I sank into the plush leather seat of my private car,finally able to let my guard down.

"Jesus Christ, I'm exhausted," I groaned, letting my head fall back."I had no idea Thomas was such a nightmare to work with. The man's a freaking drill sergeant!"

Sophie glanced up from her phone, a small smile playing on her lips. "What are you looking at? You've been glued to that thing all morning."

"Nothing much. But Victoría, have you noticed that all those nasty stories about you online have disappeared? They've been replaced with news about your current projects."

"What?" I sat bolt upright, suddenly wide awake. "Give me that phone!"

I snatched it from her hands, frantically scrolling through the entertainment news sites. Sure enough, the vicious headlines linking me to
Brandon had vanished. In their place were glowing articles about my Diana campaign and my casting in "Midnight Echo."

"Victoria Taylor Lands Coveted Role in 'Midnight Echo"

"Diana's New Face: Victoria Taylor Dazzles in First Campaign Shots"

I scrolled faster, my hands trembling slightly. Not a single mention of the alleged affair.

"Oh my God," I whispered, tears pricking at my eyes. "What the hell happened? How is this possible?"

Sophie shrugged. "Must be something happening at Stark Group headquarters. Looks like your troubles are finally over."

I clutched her hand tightly. "I knew those ridiculous accusations wouldn't stick forever. Sophie, thank you for standing by me through all of this.When everything was falling apart, you were the only one who never left my side."


"Don't be silly," Sophie said, squeezing my hand. "That's what best friends are for. Now that this mess is behind you, you should probably think about moving back home. Staying at your parents' place isn't a good look."

"You're right," I agreed. "I've weathered this storm, but I can't give those vultures any more ammunítion. I should move back today."

Even as I said the words, a knot formed in my stomach. Alexander had been so quick to believe the worst about me.

My mind drifted to Brandon's face, the way he'd announced me as Diana's spokesperson that night. The pride in his voice, the confidence in his decision.
My heart skipped a beat.

"Victoria? Hello? Earth to Victoria!"

Sophie's voice snapped me back to reality. She was waving her hand in front of my face.

"Brandon!" I blurted out, then immediately wished I could take it back.

Sophie's eyebrows shot up. "What? What about Brandon?"

I blinked rapidly. "Huh?"

"I've been trying to get your attention for like a full minute," Sophie said."
You just completely zoned out. And then you said Brandon's name.What's going on?"

"Nothing! Nothing at all!" I insisted, feeling heat rise to my cheeks. "I was just thinking about this whole situation-trying to figure out who set me up."


My heart was pounding loudly. What was *wrong* with me? Why was I thinking about Brandon Stark,of all people?




The next few days passed in a whirlwind. The Diana photoshoot wrapped ahead of schedule, with everyone raving about the campaign's potential."Midnight Echo" officially announced its cast, with me prominently featured.

Despite the disappearance of the negative press, I couldn't help noticing the way people still whispered when I walked by. The story might have been scrubbed from the internet, but it lingered in people's memories.

When I finally pushed open the door to the house Alexander and I shared,
I was greeted by silence.

"I'm home!" I called out, my voice echoing in the empty foyer.

The housekeeper emerged from the kitchen, her eyes widening in surprise.

"Madam, you're back!" she exclaimed. "Would you like me to prepare something to eat?"

"Just make whatever," I said, then paused at the foot of the stairs."Actually, prepare whatever my husband enjoys. Let me know when he gets home."


I spent the nnext hours meticulously preparing for Alexander's return.Fresh sheets, expensive perfume, a long bubble bath. By the time I heard the front door, I'd transformed into the perfect picture of a devoted wife.

I emerged from the bathroom wrapped in silk, my hair still damp.Alexander stood in our bedroom, shrugging off his jacket. He barely spared me a glance before turning away.

"Alex, you're home!" I said brightly. "The chef made your favorites tonight.I've got the next few days off, so we can actually have dinner together!"

"Hmm,"was his only response.

"Alex," I finally said, my voice smaller than intended. "I've explained everything. You know the truth now. Why are you still treating me like this? There's nothing between Brandon and me. I love *you*-enough that I was willing to hurt Summer to be with you."

Alexander's posture softened slightly.

"Fine, I'm not really angry anymore," he conceded. "But you need to be
more careful. This scandal has put me in an incredibly difficult position."

I stepped closer. "I understand that. But think about it-why would Brandon give me these opportunities? It has to be because of you."

I took a breath before continuing, my voice dropping. "Do you know Elle Sinclair? Brandon's cousin? I think she's behind all this. She seems to have it out for any woman who gets close to Brandon. It's like she's obsessed with him."


Alexander's eyes narrowed. "Elle Sinclair? Are you saying she has feelings for Brandon?"


I nodded eagerly. "At the annual party, Brandon just made a simple announcement about my contract. Next thing I know, someone's plastering doctored photos of us everywhere. This wasn't a coincidence, Alex."

'Alexander was quiet for a moment. Then he looked at me with a decisiveness that made my stomach clench.

"If it's that complicated, then maybe you should step away from it all," he said firmly. "Now that everything's died down, it might be the perfect time for you to leave the entertainment industry altogether."

I froze."Excuse me?"

"The entertainment world is full of these politics," Alexander continued."Look at all the trouble it's caused. The Taylor family doesn't need the money, and neither do you. I can certainly provide for you."

I stared at him,speechless. Then the anger hit.

"Are you seriously asking me to give up my career?" I demanded. "This has nothing to do with money, Alex. Acting is my *dream*-it's what I've
always wanted! And now that everything's finally falling into place,you want me to just walk away?"

Alexander's face hardened."You-"

"No," I cut him off. "I will listen to you about almost anything,but not this.Never this. My career is non-negotiable."


From then on, this same argument played out repeatedly, with neither of us willing to budge. We existed in the same house but might as well have been living on different planets. Even sleeping in the same bed, we maintained a careful distance that felt wider than any ocean.

He wouldn't back down. And neither would I.
###Chapter 247: Host's Rules

**Summer's POV**

I sprawled across our Manhattan apartment's couch, mindlessly flipping through TV channels. Nothing caught my interest-not the reality shows,the news, or even those home renovation programs I usually loved.The remote clicked rhythmically as I cycled through the options for the third time.


Brandon was in the kitchen, the soft sounds of chopping creating a homey soundtrack to my boredom. The mouthwatering aroma wafted through our apartment, but even that couldn't hold my attention.

God, I was so bored.

I tossed the remote aside and padded over to the kitchen doorway.Leaning against the frame, I watched Brandon work his magic. His sleeves were rolled up, revealing his forearms as he expertly handled a chef's knife.

"Brandon, are you absolutely sure you don't need my help?" I asked,playfully gripping the doorframe.

He glanced up, the corner of his mouth quirking upward. "I'm sure."

"I could keep you company then," I offered. "We could chat while you cook."


Brandon's knowing gaze met mine. "I don't think you're actually interested in talking. You're just bored and need someone to entertain you."

Busted. I bit my lip to hold back a laugh.

Brandon set down his knife and wiped his hands on a nearby towel."
Come here," he beckoned.

I practically skipped over to him. "Yes, sir! What are your orders? I'm at your service!" I gave him a mock salute.

He almost reached for my head but stopped, noticing the oil on his fingers."Stop being silly. If you're that bored, you can help me by sorting these vegetables."


He handed me a basket of fresh produce. As I started working, I couldn't help stealing glances at him. The way his brow furrowed in concentration was hypnotic.


Brandon caught me staring and shook his head. "If you keep looking at me like that, we might not get dinner at all tonight."

I felt heat rise to my cheeks but was saved by the shrill sound of our doorbell.

"Who could that be?" I wondered aloud, setting the basket down.

I peered through the peephole and did a double-take. What the hell?

I opened the door to find Dr. Sean Sullivan leaning against our doorframe,holding a fancy fruit basket.

"Hey there! Long time no see!" he greeted me with that megawatt smile.

"Dr. Sean! What a surprise," I replied, a polite smile plastered on my face."Please,come in."


I glanced at his feet as he entered. "Don't bother with taking off your shoes. Just come on in."


Dr. Sean sauntered into our living room,placing the fruit basket on our
coffee table before looking around the apartment.

"Not bad, not bad at all. It's been what, six months since I was last here?Didn't expect it to look so... different!"

I noticed he was dressed surprisingly light for the chilly weather-just the suit and shirt, no overcoat. I grabbed a glass of warm water and handed it to him.


"Here, warm yourself up a bit. You must be freezing."

"Thanks." He accepted the glass, then looked around with furrowed brows.
"Wait,Brandon didn't tell you I was coming over today?"

I shook my head.

"That jerk!" Dr. Sean exclaimed, wandering further into the apartment. "He's the one who told me to come up in the first place. Where is he anyway?"

Dr. Sean poked his head into various doorways until he found the kitchen,then suddenly froze. I peeked around him to see Brandon standing there,knife in hand, with a deadly expression.

"Hey, buddy," Dr. Sean laughed nervously. "Um, maybe don't hold that knife while giving me that look? It's seriously terrifying."

"Man, I never thought I'd see this day," Dr. Sean continued. "Back in the day, I always thought you'd be the cold-blooded one out of all of us.Probably the only one of the 'Four Kings of Wall Street' who'd end up alone. But look at you now... completely domesticated!"

Brandon raised an eyebrow, and Dr. Sean visibly tensed.

"Just kidding! Just a joke!" he backpedaled quickly. "Technically speaking,
Ethan's the one most likely to end up alone forever!"

"Get out," Brandon muttered, the hint of a smile betraying his feigned annoyance.

I returned to the living room, settling on the floor next to the garbage can with the basket of vegetables. I started sorting through them,removing any bad spots.

Dr. Sean wandered back in, towering over me as I worked.

"Summer," he said with a dramatic sigh, "Brandon is so inconsiderate!How could he make a delicate flowerlike you do such menial labor?"

I looked up at him. "What do you mean?"

"I mean, this kind of rough work should be done by a man!" He turned toward the kitchen. "Right, Brandon?"

I bit back a smile, seeing the perfect opportunity. "You know what, Dr.Sean? I think you're absolutelyright."

He beamed at me. "See? I knew you'd agree! Brandon just doesn't understand how to properly treat a lady."

Without hesitation, I handed him the vegetable basket and stood up. "Here you go then! Since this is man's work, I'll leave it to you. I'm going to watch some TV."


Dr.Sean's face fell comically."Wait,what?"

I cocked my head innocently. "But aren't you a man, Dr. Sean?"

"Well, yes,but-" he stammered, looking down at the basket like it contained live snakes.
"You know, Summer," he sighed, "you used to be so sweet and innocent.How did you turn so... Brandon-like?"

I smoothed my shirt and smiled sweetly. "In our home, guests follow the host's rules. Don't you think that's fair?"

Dr. Sean's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water.

Brandon emerged from the kitchen, and Dr. Sean immediately appealed to him. "Bro, look what your wife is making me do!"

Brandon crossed his arms. "What about my wvife?"

"She's forcing me to sort vegetables!"

"Don't like it? There's the door," Brandon replied coolly.

Defeated, Dr. Sean perched on a small stool and began sorting vegetables,occasionally shooting me betrayed looks over his designer glasses.




Dinner was surprisingly pleasant. Dr. Sean attacked his food like he hadn't eaten in days, though he still maintained elegant table manners while shoveling food at remarkable speed.


Brandon and I had already finished and were watching Dr.Sean continue to enthusiastically devour everything in sight.

"Dr. Sean, slow down. Nobody's going to steal your food," I cautioned,pouring him a glass of water as he finally appeared to be winding down.

He gulped it down gratefully before returning to the last bits on his plate.

"Seriously, when was the last time you ate?" I asked, genuinely curious."
You're acting like this is your first meal after hibernation."
###Chapter 248: Sean Is the Only One

**Brandon's POV**

Sean dramatically held up three fingers, eyes wide with exaggerated suffering. "Three days! I haven't had a proper meal in three whole days!"

"I've been stuck at Manhattan General doing back-to-back surgeries," he continued, gesturing wildly. "Just got off the operating table this morning.Too exhausted to even eat. Went straight home, crashed until now, then came straight here."

He clutched his chest, giving Summer his best wounded puppy look. "You have no idea how much we doctors suffer! How desperately we need care and affection!"

To complete his act, he pretended to wipe away nonexistent tears.

Summer rolled her eyes and handed him a napkin. "Dr. Sean,your performance is way over the top. The acting is soobvious!"

Sean immediately dropped the act, his sorrowful expression vanishing."Come on, can't you show a little sympathy? Shouldn't a normal person feel sorry for me? Maybe comfort me a little?"

Summer's eyebrows shot up. "You? Need *my* comfort?" She pointed at him, then herself, before turning to me with a questioning look.

I narrowed my eyes at Sean. The message was clear.

Sean's laughter turned nervous. "No, no! Absolutely not! That is obviously reserved for Brandon!" He raised both hands in surrender. "Seriously, you two are something else. I'm here to help you guys out, you know!"
Summer looked confused. "Help us? With what? Weren't you just here to mooch a free meal?"

"Summer!" Sean clutched his chest in mock pain. "That hurts! If I just wanted food,couldn't I have gone to any restaurant on Madison Avenue?Why would I come all the way over here?"

He leaned in with a melodramatic whisper. "If Brandon hadn't twisted my arm, do you think I'd willingly come play third wheel?"

I shook my head, cutting him off. "Don't listen to his bullshit." Turning to Summer,I kept my tone gentle. "June, why don't you clear the dishes?Sean and I need to talk."


Summer nodded. "Sure. You guys can use the living room. Sorry the apartment doesn't have a study."


Sean softened his expression. "Don't worry about it. I was just kidding around." He stood up, energized after the meal. "Let's go, Brandon."

The moment we were out of Summer's earshot, Sean's demeanor shifted completely. Gone was the joking, carefree doctor-in his place sat one of Wall Street's most formidable players.

"So what's the real reason you called me here?" he asked directly, pulling out a cigarette but just toying with it. "There were people watching downstairs when I arrived. What's going on?"

"Sinclair's people," I replied simply.

Sean's eyes widened. "The Sinclairs? Shit, your mother is serious about this?"


He leaned back. "I mean, Elle isn't even Jeffrey's biological daughter, but he'
s going all out for her? Especially considering..."

He shrugged. "What's your plan? Those rumors you spread about you and Victoria seemed to work well-diverted attention. But your people are still in place, which means your mother's side isn't backing down, huh?"

I nodded. "Mmm."

"Elle had her people withdraw surveillance a few days ago," I explained,"but they've suddenly returned. I suspect Jeffrey Sinclair has stepped in personally. He's not easily fooled."

Sean studied me, understanding dawning on his face. "So you called me here to let them continue thinking there's something between me and Summer?" He gave me a pointed look. "You know, Brandon, that's not exactly playing fair."

I allowed myself a small smile. "How is it unfair?"

"Because you always use me as your shield," Sean complained. "Why not Edward? Why can't you ask him for help?"

I frowned. "He's Grace's husband."

"Wrong," Sean corrected with a derisive snort. "Ex-husband. They've been divorced for three years now."

My lips tightened. The room suddenly felt colder.

After a moment, Sean sighed. "Fine. I'm already here, and I've already eaten your food. What exactly do you need me to do? But you know this kind of deception can't work long-term. Your uncle is sharp-he'll see through it eventually."
"We don't need to keep it up for long," I said firmly. "Three months, max."

"In those three months. I'll deal with the Elle problem once and for all,and send Jane Sinclair back to Washington. I can't bring Summer home until that's handled."

"Alright, three months it is," Sean agreed. "But remember, if my family finds out about this charade, they'll start pushing me into arranged marriages again. So make it quick." He flicked the unlit cigarette into the trash can.

Sean wandered to the window and peered down. "Your uncle is really persistent, watching all night like this." He turned back to me. "I'm actually wondering-with all that surveillance,how did you manage to get up here?"

I raised an eyebrow, amused. "Care to guess?"

"I couldn't care less," Sean retorted, checking his watch. "Do I need to stay here all night? You know I'm busy, and besides, you and Summer probably want your privacy..."


"No rush," I interrupted, reaching into my coat pocket. I tossed him a key.

Sean caught it, eyeing it with confusion. "What's this for?"

"Starting today, you're living across the hall," I sad matter-of-factly,standing to open the door. "It's getting late. After you."

Sean's eye twitched as he pointed across the hallway. "Wait... Brandon.you're joking, right? Tell me you're joking."

"Do I look like I'm joking?" I mimicked his innocent smile, pushing him toward the door. "Everything's set up. All youI need to do is move in."
"Hey, Brandon," Sean protested, "this is something you should have discussed with me first! This place is too far from Manhattan General.You know my work schedule-"

I continued pushing him across the hall. "I'm discussing it with you now.aren't I? Plus, you'll get free breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. What's not to like?"

I glanced around the apartment. "I'm concerned Summer might be in danger, and I can't be here all the time. Your current role makes you the perfect candidate."

After surveying the apartment, Sean finally nodded in resignation. "Fine.For the free meals, I'll agree temporarily. But this isn't a long-term solution. What exactly are you planning?"

"You don't need to concern yourself with that," I told him firmly. "Just show up here daily, that's all."

"You're a sly bastard, using me as your shield," Sean remarked, but there was reluctant respect in his voice. "Your uncle must be quite the opponent.
" He pocketed the key. "Alright, it's late. I'll get familiar with the place."




I returned to my apartment-to Summer, She was standing by the door,clearly having heard at least part of our conversation.

"Why are you standing here?" I asked softly.

Her brow was furrowed with concern. "Are you really making Dr.Sean move in across the hall? Isn't that too much trouble for him? I can manage on my own,really. There's no need to inconvenience him with all this coming and going!"
I could tell she'd overheard enough to be worried, but not enough to understand the full situation. That was for the best.

"It's fine," I assured her, guiding her back inside. "He has to go home every day anyway. Doesn't matter where 'home'is."

I closed the door behind us. "Besides, Sean is the only one who can handle this particular task."
###Chapter 249: People You Don't Mess With

**Elle's POV**

For the past two weeks. I'd had people watching Summer's apartment like hawks. Every day, it was the same infuriating report-that arrogant doctor kept showing up at her place. Fancy clothes, flashy car, staying until ungodly hours. I didn't need a detective to tell me what was happening there.

The photos my investigator had sent me burned in my handbag as I waited in my suite at The Bellevue Grand Hotel. Daddy was finally in town, and I was going to mnake sure he understood the situation.

When the door opêned, I jumped up, my heart doing that little skip it always did when I saw him. Jeffrey Sinclair entered the room looking every bit the Washington power player-impeccably tailored black suit,silver-streaked hair perfectly styled, his posture commanding respect without a word.


"Daddy!" I rushed over to hug him, inhaling the familiar scent of his expensive cologne.

"Elle," he returned my embrace briefly before settling into the armchair by the window. "You look well. Now, tell me what was so urgent it couldn't wait until I was properly settled?"

I wasted no time pulling out the folder from my handbag, spreading the surveillance photos across the coffee table.

"I've been having Summer Taylor followed," I explained, kneeling beside the table to arrange the pictures. "And look who keeps showing up at her apartment."
Daddy leaned forward, picking up one of the blurry photos. His expression remained neutral, but I could see the slight narrowing of his eyes-the tell-tale sign that something had caught his attenton.

"You're saying this man is from the Sullivan family?" he studied the photo of a man, holding it at different angles to get a better look. "What else have your people found out about him?"

"His name is Michael Sullivan," I explained eagerly, pleased to have captured my father's interest. "Elizabeth Taylor introduced him to Summer a few months ago. Apparently, Michael's mother and Elizabeth were college roommates or something equally boring."

I sat back on my heels, watching Daddy's face carefully as I continued.

"Elizabeth clearly favors Victoria over Summer-always has. But I think Elizabeth was actually trying to set up an alliance with the Sullivan family through Summer."

Daddy's eyes never left the photo as I detailed what I'd discovered.

"Michael Sullivan... you're certain this is him?" Daddy finally asked, his tone making me sit up straighter.

"Positive," I replied, pulling out another photo and handing it to him."Here's a photo fromn when Elizabeth first introduced them. They've been in contact ever since, though I don't think Elizabeth knows. Summer's playing it smart-using Michael to escape the Taylor family without giving them any advantage."

Daddy's expression suddenly shifted, and he placed the photos down carefully. "Pull your surveillance team off Summer immediately."

"What? Why?" I couldn't hide my surprise.
"Do you have any idea who Michael Sullivan really is?" He pressed his lips into a thin line. "We've stumbled onto something much bigger than we anticipated."

I scoffed. unable to help myself. "He's nowhere near as powerful as Brandon in New York! Don't tell me you're actually afraid of him?"

I sat beside Daddy on the arm of his chair, my frustration boiling over."Look, I know you're worried, but Summer is a real threat. She looks *exattly* like that horrible woman! I know they're not involved yet, but with her working at Stark Group and looking like that, it's only a matter of time before Brandon falls for her. Daddy, I need you to help me get her fired."

"Enough!" Daddy's sharp tone made me flinch. His eyes softened almost immediately as he saw my reaction. "You've always been too impulsive,Elle."

He sighed, his stern expression melting at my wounded look. "That's not what I meant, sweetheart. Listen to me-you cannot make a move against Summer right now. Your priority should be dealing with Victoria.Summer is off-limits for the time being."

"But why?" I protested. "She's nobody! The Taylors barely acknowledge her existence. So what if she's dating Michael Sullivan?"


"Michael Sullivan might not be a concern, but what about the Turner family?" Daddy shook his head. "Elle, I know your focus is entirely on Brandon, but you need to pay attention to the bigger picture. Do you know who Michael Sullivan really is?"

I stared blankly at him, confused. "Who? What does the Turner family have to do with Michael Sullivan?"
Daddy leaned forward, his voice dropping to just above a whisper. "Let me ask you again-do you know Michael Sullivan's real identity?"

"No.., who is he?"

"Jesse Turner. Michael Sullivan is actually Jesse Turner, heir to the Turner'family fortune in Philadelphia. People call him the Turner family's second son. His mother is Daisy Sullivan, the Sullivan family's eldest daughter.'Michael Sullivan' is just a name the Sullivan family gave him."

I felt the color drain from my face. I'd never met Jesse Turner, but his reputation in Philadelphia was legendary-ruthless, dangerous, someone even the old money families were careful around.

"So that's why..." I trailed off, my mind racing;to connect the dots.

"Exactly," Daddy nodded. "Until we understand why Jesse Turner is in New York, we can't risk moving against him directly."

I sank into the chair opposite him, processing this information."I understand. I'll leave Summer alone for now, but Daddy, Victoria is out of control! Brandon has given her so many opportunities-the Diana contract,that film role. He's flaunting their relationship without any concern for appearances. She's a married woman, for God's sake! He'd rather be with a married woman than marry me." My voice broke slightly. "I can't stand it."

Daddy's eyes softened. "And you shouldn't have to. I've seen Victoria's photos-she's not as beautiful as you, and her education doesn't come close to yours. Your job now is to win Brandon back!"


"I will," I promised, clenching my fists until my knuckles turned white,rage burning behind my eyes. "Daddy, you'll help me, won't you?"

"That's why I'm here," he assured me. "To assess the situation and have a
little chat with Brandon."

He beckoned me over with a gentle motion of his hand. "Come here."

I moved to his side, linking my arm through his affectionately. "Daddy,are you hungry? It's getting late-should we go down for dinner?"

"Yes. My sweet girl."

As he looked at my face, something changed in his expression. A softness entered his eyes that I rarely saw. He reached out, stroking my cheek with unexpected tenderness before pulling me into a tight embrace.

"Elle," he whispered, his voice suddenly thick with emotion.

I trembled slightly at the intensity of his embrace but returned it, patting his back reassuringy. "Daddy, what's wrong?"

He pulled back abruptly, something flickering in his eyes before he regainedhis composure. "Nothing, sweetheart. I was just thinking about how grown up you are now, about to be married... it's hard for a father to let go."

"There's nothing to let go of," I assured him,easily slipping into the sweet,daughterly tone that always worked with him. "I'll be marrying Brandon,and you're his mother's relative. You can visit us in New York anytime,or we'll come see you in Washington. Or when you retire, you could even move in with us! Elle will take care of Daddy forever."
###Chapter 250: It's Been Too Long, Nephew

**Brandon's POV**

I peered out from behind the curtains. The black sedan that had been parked across the street for nearly two weeks was gone-finally. I double-checked the surrounding buildings, scanning for any lingering surveillance.Nothing obvious, but that didn't mean we were in the clear.

Behind me, I could hear Sean's dramatic sigh as he sprawled across Summer's sofa. He'd been camping out in the apartment across the hall for the past two weeks, acting as our first line of defense against the Sinclair family's watchful eyes.

"Hey," Sean called out, twirling a toothpick between his fingers. "Those guys have finally packed up and left. When can I get my life back and stop playing bodyguard?"

I let the curtain fall back into place and turned to face him, my expression giving nothing away. "Sorry, but I'm afraid you won't be going anywhere just yet."

Sean groaned, shoving the toothpick into the corner of his mouth. "Seriously? What now?" He slumped deeper into the cushions, the picture of exaggerated suffering.

Summer emerged from the kitchen carrying two steaming mugs of coffee,her hair pulled back in a loose ponytail. She handed one to me and another to Sean, her brow creased with concern.

"Actually," she said1, settling beside me on the loveseat, "I was thinking the same thing. Those surveillance guys are gone, Sean. You've been stuck here for almost two weeks-there's really no need for you to keep living
across the hall anymore."

"No." I said firmly, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. "He stays."

Sean threw his hands up in exasperation. "Why? Don't you think you're being a little paranoid? They're gone, Brandon. Let me go back to my actual life instead of watching you two play house every night."

"For the past two weeks, you've done nothing but eat our food and complain about being our third wheel," I reminded him. "And yet here you still are. Some might call that masochistic."

Sean choked on his coffee. "Low blow, man."

I ignored his theatrics and leaned forward, my voice dropping. "James just sent word-Jeffrey Sinclair's name was flagged át JFK International. He arrived in New York last night."

Sean's eyes widened. "Wait, your uncle is in town? Isn't that why your surveillance buddies suddenly vanished?"

"Exactly," I nodded. "You think it's a coincidence that after weeks of constant surveillance, they suddenly disappeared right when Jeffrey arrived?"


"But shouldn't that make things better?" Sean pressed. "If your uncle ordered them to back off-"

"You don't know Jeffrey," I cut him off. "This is temporary. He's just shifting tactics, waiting for me to let my guard down. Give it a few days-new surveillance will be in place, probably more discreet this time."

Summer placed a gentle hand on my arm. "Brandon, don't you think you might be overthinking this? Maybe your uncle is just here to visit Elle."
Before I could respond, my phone rang. I glanced at the screen and let out a dry laugh. "Speak of the devil." I tilted the display so Summer could see the caller ID:Jeffrey Sinclair.

I held up a finger to signal for quiet before answering.

"Hello," I said, my voice neutral.

"Brandon, it's me-your uncle!" Jeffrey's voice was overly warm,a practiced affability that never reached his eyes when we were face to face.

"I know," I replied coolly, adjusting my position so I could hold Summer's hand. "To what do I owe the pleasure of this call, Uncle?"

"Do you have some time tomorrow? Let's meet up! It's been too long since we've seen each other,nephew."

I caught Sean's eye and gestured for him to stay silent. "You're in New York?"

"Yes, I am," Jeffrey confirmed, his tone still carefully amiable. "Elle's been away from Washington for months, refusing to come home. A father's heart aches, so I had to come see her myself."

"How convenient," I replied, not bothering to mask my sarcasm."Elle and my mother have been guests at the Stark residence for quite some time now. Since you're here, perhaps you could extend your stay for a few days,then take them both back to Washington with you."

There was a telling pause on the other end of the line.

I pressed my advantage, "I'll adjust my schedule to meet with you tomorrow. It has been three years since that... incident, hasn't it? Three years since we've properly spoken."
"That would be wonderful," Jeffrey recovered smoothly. "Let's say tomorrow morning? I'm staying at-"
"As a guest in my city," I interrupted, "I'll choose the location. I'll have my assistant contact you with the details. It's getting late now, so if there's nothing else..."

I ended the call before he could respond, allowing myself a small,cynical smile as I set the phone down.

Sean whistled low. "Damn, Brandon. The temperature just dropped ten degrees in here."

"What?" I asked innocently.

"That was cold, even for you," Sean elaborated, standing up and stretching."The guy is still your uncle, technically your elder. Aren't you worried about pissing him off with that attitude?"

I shrugged. "You think he's spent all this effort trying to force me into marrying Elle just to throw a tantrum now? He's too calculated for that."I waved a dismissive hand. "Anyway, you've had your entertainment for the night. You can head back across the hall now."

Sean snorted. "Wow,talk about using people and throwing them away.Real nice, Brandon."


"I didn't hear you complaining about the free meals," I pointed out.

He shook his head but made his way to the door. "You're something else,you know that? Call me if you need anything-though I'm sure you will whether I want you to or not."

After Sean left,Summer turned to me, her expression troubled. "Are you
sure this is the right approach? Challenging your uncle so directly?"
###Chapter 251: I'd Rather A Married Woman

**Brandon's POV**

I pulled Summer close, feeling her warmth against my chest as I rested my chin on the top of her head. "Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. If I wasn't confident. I wouldn't take the risk."

She looked up at me. "What do you think he wants? Why come to New York now?"


"To verify things for himself," I said thoughtfully. "Jeffrey doesn't trust anyone-not reports, not underlings, not even his own eyes sometimes. He needs to personally confirm the situation before he makes his next move."


Summer caught on immediately."Syour meeting tomorrow is about reassuring him?"


"Look at you, figuring it all out," I smniled, tapping her nose lightly. "My clever little wife."


"But why is he so invested in this?" she pressed. "Is it really all about Elle?"


I shook my head. "Elle is just a pawn. I don't know his ultimate endgame,but Jeffrey's ambitions have always been substantial. Years ago, when relations between the Stark and Sinclair families were less strained, he was more subtle. Now he's getting impatient. This situation will need to be resolved, one way or another."


Her eyes searched mine. "What happened three years ago? You mentioned an 'incident' on the phone."

I hesitated, memories of that night in Washington flashing through my mind. The drugged whiskey, Elle in my bed. Jeffrey's staged discovery, the accusations, the ultimatum-it wasn't something I wanted to revisit tonight.
"Some friction between our families," I said vaguely. "It's a long story,and it's getting late. I'll tell you another time."

Summer nodded. not pushing further. "We should get some rest then. You'Il need your energy for tomorrow's meeting with your uncle."


She understood me so well-knew when to press and when to let things be. I felt a rush of gratitude as I followed her to the bedroom, momentarily forgetting about Jeffrey and the troubles ahead.




The next day, I arrived at Le Bernardin early to ensure, everything was precisely as I wanted it. The largest VIP room had been prepared to my specifications-a display of power on my home turf.

When James ushered Jeffrey in, I stood to greet him. "Uncle. Please,have a seat." I gestured to the chair across from me before instructing James to bring tea.


Jeffrey removed his coat, his keen eyes taking in every detail of my appearance. I knew what he was seeing-the changes in me since we last met face to face. I was no longer the younger man who could be manipulated or coerced.

"You've matured," he observed. "More composed, more... present."

I poured tea for us both. "I took the liberty of ordering your favorite dishes,
"I said, ignoring his comment. "But let's not pretend this is merely a
family reunion. When exactly did you arrive in New York, Uncle?"

Jeffrey's smile didn't reach his eyes. "With your connections, I'm sure you already know the answer. Not much happens in this city without Brandon Stark hearing about it, does it?"

"You flatter me," I replied mildly. "New York is vast, and I can't possibly
keep track of everything-particularly the small details."

I shifted gears abruptly. "Have you seen my mother and Elle yet? They must be eager to see you."

Jeffrey had no choice but to follow my conversational lead. "No, I only arrived last night. Haven't had the chance to visit them yet."

"I'm touched that you prioritized seeing me," I said, the irony thick in my voice. "They've been staying at the Stark residence for quite some time now. Once you've concluded your business here, perhaps you could take them back to Washington with you? They're constantly complaining about New York to my father and Uncle Gavin-clearly they miss home."

Jeffrey frowned slightly. "Jane has never mentioned any discomfort to me."He paused, a calculating look crossing his face. "Besides. Jane is a Stark now. She should get used to New York eventually."

He leaned forward, changing tactics. "As for Elle... she and you..."

"Elle is my cousin," I stated flatly, cutting him off. "It's natural that I look after her, but I can't be responsible for her indefinitely."


Jeffrey sighed, apparently deciding to abandon subtlety. "Brandon, it's just us family here. Let's speak plainly. What are your intentions regarding Elle? You know she's not my biological daughter, so there's no ethical issue with you two being together. Elle genuinely loves you, and after what happened three years ago..."

"Uncle," I interrupted, my voice hardening. "Since you want plain speaking.let me be absolutely clear: my position hasn't changed since three years ago. Elle is my cousin, now and always. Unless you formally remove her from the Sinclair family, which-let's be honest-would actually sever any connection she has to me as well. Either way, in my eyes,she's essentially a stranger."
Jeffrey's expression darkened. "Is that truly how you feel? After everything?Three years ago, she gave you everything, Brandon. I'm not trying to force you,but your actions then-"

"Victoria Taylor," I interjected, watching his reaction carefully. "I assume you've investigated her by now? Let me make one thing perfectly clear:whatever plans you have for her, you should reconsider. For every move you make against her, I'll elevate her position twice as much."

"She's a married woman!" Jeffrey protested,genuine confusion crossing his face. "Brandon, I've looked into her background thoroughly. In what possible way is she superior to Elle?"


I held his gaze, delivering my final blow with icy precision. "I would rather be involved with a married woman than with someone who is mentally unstable. Is that clear enough for you, Uncle?"


The shock on Jeffrey's face confirmed my message had landed precisely as intended.
###Chapter 252: Ring

**Brandon's POV**

Jeffrey Sinclair's face flushed crimson as he slammed his fist against the polished mahogany table, making the delicate teacup in front of him rattle.

"How dare you!" he hissed, his composure crumbling.

I studied his outburst with clinical detachment. The private dining room at Le Bernardin had excellent soundproofing-perfect for these little family dramas. Reaching for the teapot, I refilled his cup with practiced ease.

"Uncle, please calm down," I said, my voice deliberately gentle. "Your blood pressure."


Jeffrey's eyes narrowed, his breathing more controlled. A seasoned Washington operator, he was quickly realizing his mistake. Unlike his usual political opponents, I wouldn't be intimidated by an emotional outburst.


"This isn't how I imagined this conversation would go," he said finally,straightening his tie. "Brandon, I came all the way from DC to discuss your future with Elle. Not to be insulted."


"Let's be reasonable here," he continued, his tone shifting to something more diplomatic. "Elle comes from an excellent background. The Sinclair name carries weight in Washington. She's educated, cultured,beautiful-everything a man in your position could want in a wife." He paused. "Whereas Victoria Taylor... Brandon, she's a married woman. The gossip in New York high society has been merciless. Do you really think the Stark family would accept someone like her?"

I allowed myself a thin smile. "You're right about one thing, Uncle. I do have many options for potential partners."
"Exactly my point, Jeley Hoddec c

"But," I continued. "I'd prefer someone mentally stable over someone with a documented history of psychiatric issues. Wouldn't the Stark family more readily accept a woman with a clean bill of mental health than someone who's been institutionalized multiple times?"

Jeffrey's face darkened again. "Elle does not have mental problems. That's absurd."


"Is it?" I asked, tilting my head slightly. "Then perhaps you can explain what she was being treated for ten years ago? Or three years ago during the Washington incident? Or her most recent hospitalization just before coming to New York?"

I turned to James, who had been standing silently by the door. "James."

James immediately stepped forward, placing a thick manila envelope on the table in front of Jeffrey.


Jeffrey stared at the envelope before finally reaching for it. His hands trembed slightly as he undid the clasp and slid out the contents-medical records,psychiatric evaluations, documentation of multiple inpatient stays at exclusive mental health facilities.


The color drained from his face as he flipped through the pages.

"This is... this is a violation of privacy," he stammered. "How did you get these?"


"Uncle. I've known about Elle's condition for years," I said calmly. "Did you really think I wouldn't investigate after what happened in Washington? I'm the CEO of Stark Group, not some naive college kid you can manipulate."


Jeffrey pushed the papers away, his jaw working as he fought for control. "
It's not what you think, Elle's condition... it's not her fault. Her mother had similar issues. I was put in an impossible position back then."

"I understand." I replied, my tone softening just enough to offer him a sliver of dignity. "Family is complicated. Elle's condition isn't her choice I get that. And I'm told she's doing much better now, stabilized with the right medication."


Jeffrey latched onto this perceived opening. "Exactly! She's nothing like her mother. Elle is sweet, kind. She's never hurt anyone."


"And I'm willing to take care of her," I said carefully. "As a cousin, a family member. She'll never want for anything. But if you or anyone else has *other* expectations..." I let the implication hang in the air. "The Stark family won't agree to that."

I slid the envelope back toward him. "Consider this my gift for your visit to New York."


Standing up, I adjusted my cuffs. James immediately stepped forward with my overcoat.


"I'm afraid I have other matters to attend to," I said. "James will arrange for a guide to show you around the city. New York has its own... rulebook.
It would be beneficial for you to understand how things work here."




"Your uncle seemed less than pleased," James remarked as we strode down Le Bernardin's richly carpeted hallway.


"As you predicted, the Sinclair Group's stock has been unstable lately.There are whispers of internal problems."

I nodded. "Good. Let's help them along, shall we? Cause a little more trouble."
"Sir?" James looked at me. a spark of excitement in his eyes.

I said. "Let's make sure Jeffrey has plenty to worry about at home before he can focus on us. Get the Sinclair family squabbling amongst themselves."

"How soon do you want results?"

"Three days. Have their stock drop at least fifteen percent. What position does Jeffrey's son hold in the family company?"


"Project Management Director," James replied promptly. "Quite capable.from what I've heard. but Jeffrey keeps him under his thumb. He owns a fifteen percent stake in the Sinclair Group."

"Perfect." I nodded. "And what about his uncle? Philip Sinclair?"


"He's been semi-retired for years but still sits on the board. He and Jeffrey have a...complicated relationship."


"Then he's our chess piece," I decided, glancing out the window at the darkening sky. "Looks like rain's coming.


We reached the entrance where my car was already waiting. I slid into the back seat. James settling beside me.

"Back to Stark Tower, sir?" James asked.

"Yes," I replied, leaning my head back against the leather seat.

My phone vibrated in my pocket. I pulled it out,finding several WhatsApp messages from Summer:

*How's the meeting going?

*It's cold today, make sure to wear your coat!*

*Weather app says it's going to rain. Don't get caught in it-I don't want
you getting sick!*

I felt the tension in my shoulders ease as I read her messages,a smile tugging at my lips. The stormy expression I'd maintained throughout the meeting with Jeffrey softened.

James glanced at me, doing a double-take at my changed demeanor. "Sir?"

"Change of plans," I said, tucking my phone away. "Take me to Manhattan West mall."




Thirty minutes later, we pulled into Manhattan West's underground parking. I opened my eyes as the car came to a stop, stepping out without waiting for James to get the door.

The Tiffany & Co. boutique was relatively quiet at this hour. A slender woman with silver-streaked black hair looked up as I entered, recognition lighting her eyes.

"Mr. Stark," Lisa greeted me warmly. "What an unexpected pleasure. It's been some time since you visited here."

I scanned the gleaming display cases, taking in the arrays of diamonds and precious stones.

"How can I help you today?" she asked, noting my focused attention.

I met her eyes directly, my decision already made. "Rings," I said simply."Wedding rings."

James, who had followed me into the store, nearly stumbled at my words.
###Chapter 253:BS

**Brandon's POV**

Lisa's jaw literally dropped. She stared at me for a full five seconds before sputtering, "I'm sorry-what did you just say?"

"A wedding ring." I repeated, enjoying her reaction despite myself."Preferably something tasteful."

"Oh my God." Lisa's professional demeanor cracked completely. "Mr. Stark.you're not joking, are you? You're actually getting married?∗YOu∗?1′

I raised an eyebrow. "Is that so difficult to believe?"

"It's just-" Lisa caught herself. clearly realizing she might be overstepping."Well, yes, actually. Your bachelor status is practically legendary in New York society. This news would break half the hearts on theUpper East Side!"

I chuckled softly. "Then I suppose those hearts will just have to mend.Now.about those rings?"

Lisa nodded, shifting back into professional mode though her eyes still sparkled with curiosity. "Of course, of course. Every piece in my collection is completely unique, Mr. Stark. I design each one personally." She paused.unable to contaín herself. "If you don't mind my asking... who's the lucky lady? Not that actress from Stark Entertainment who's been in the papers recently? Victoria Taylor?”

I felt my smile turn cold. "What do you think, Ms. Lisa?"

She studied my face for a moment before shaking her head.11NO,probably not.She's married, isn't she? To that Stark relative-what's his name?Alexander?"





"Indeed," I replied. offering nothing more.

Lisa seemed to realize she'd hit a wall. "Well, what kind of ring were you envisioning. Mr. Stark? What does your fiancée prefer?"


"Something understated," I said. glancing around the display cases."Elegant. Nothing ostentatious."


Lisa's eyes lit up with understanding. "Ah, so your bride-to-be favors subtlety. That narrows things down considerably." She tilted her head thoughtfully. "Someone who appreciates craftsmanship over carats,perhaps?"


I didn't confirm or deny, but Lisa was already moving to a cabinet behind the counter. She unlocked it with a small key from her pocket and removed a velvet tray.

"I think I have exactly what you're looking for," she said, placing the tray on the counter.

The set consisted of matching pieces-a pair of rings, a delicate necklace.and a bracelet. All platinum with minimal embellishment, yet crafted with exquisite attention to detail. The central ring-clearly meant for a woman-featured a modest diamond set flush with the band, surrounded by an intricate pattern etched into the metal.


back down. "I'm surprised the great Lisa Jewelry has pieces that don't sell."

Lisa's smile didn't falter. "As I said. I'm a businesswoman, but I only sell to those who truly connect with the piece. It's not about selling-it's about finding the right match."

She began reaching for another display. "If this doesn't quite capture what you're looking for, I have several other collections that-"

"No." I interrupted, pointing to the tray. "This set is perfect. I'll take it."


Lisa beamed. "Excellent choice, Mr. Stark! Would you like to take it with you today? I can have it boxed up in just a few minutes."

"Not yet," I replied. "I'll need a few adjustments. The men's ring needs to be sized to match this one, and I want both rings engraved."

"Of course," Lisa nodded, reaching for a notepad. "What would you like engraved?"

I took the pen she offered and wrote two letters: BS.

Lisa studied the initials. her curiosity plainly visible. "I'll have these ready within the month. Mr. Stark. Is there any particular rush?"

"The sooner the better." I replied, already turning to leave. "James will handle the payment details. Have a good day, Ms. Lisa."


As I walked out, I could feel her eyes on my back, no doubt wondering which woman in New York had finally captured the elusive Brandon Stark-and what the initials "BS" could possibly mean.


"This arrived for your mother this morning." James explained, his tone carefully neutral. "It was sent by your uncle Jeffrey Sinclaiir-overnighted from Washington."

"And you intercepted it," I noted, not a question.

"Yes, sir." James stood with perfect posture, hands clasped behind his back.
"Standard protocol for all packages sent to the Stark residence. Dr.Sean has analyzed the contents."

I opened the bottle, examining the small white tablets inside. "And?"

"They contain a powerful sedative, commonly used to treat severe anxiety and certain..." James hesitated, choosing his words carefully, "...certain psychiatric conditions. According to our sources in the household.Elle Sinclair had an... episode yesterday. Apparently, she disposed of her previous medication."

I closed the bottle with a decisive snap. "So my dear uncle is sending more.How thoughtful."

"We've replaced the contents with vitamin supplements that look identical."James continued. "Dr. Sean assured me they're completely harmless.Would you prefer we substitute something else? As long as it's not too obvious, the switch likely wvon't be detected."

I looked up at James, allowing a coldly amused smile to cross my face.His slight discomfort was visible only in the faintest tightening around his eyes.


"What about the film announcement?" I asked. changing subjects abruptly."When is the press conference scheduled?"


"In three days," James replied. "Will you... will you actually be attending.sir?"


I fixed him with a level stare. "Is that a problem?"

"No,sir! Not at all," James quickly assured me. "I'll make all the necessary arrangements immediately."


I nodded, dismissing him with a wave. As the door closed behind him,I swiveled my chair to face the floor-to-ceiling windows of my office, looking out at the Manhattan skyline.
###Chapter 254:Press Conference

**Victoria's POV**

I let out a long sigh as the makeup artist finally stepped back,admiring her handiwork. Six straight hours of filming under those blazing hot lights had my skin practically begging for mercy. My shoulders ached, and the designer dress I'd been corseted into for the last scene had left angry red marks across my ribcage.

"That's a wrap for Ms. Taylor!" Thomas called from across the set, already reviewing footage on his monitor.

"Thank God," I muttered, immediately reaching for the makeup wipes.The heavy foundation felt like a mask, and I couldn't wait to peel it all off.

Sophie bustled into my dressing room, phone in one hand and my schedule in the other. "Great work today. Victoria. The crew's saying that last scene is definitely making the final cut."

I smiled despite my exhaustion. "Good. After thirteen takes, it damn well better."

I was halfway through removing my makeup when Sophie's phone rang.She glanced at the screen,frowning slightly before answering.

"Hello, this is Victoria Taylor's assistant speaking. May I ask who's calling?"Sophie stepped a few feet away, her voice professional. "I'm sorry, who is this? And what's this regarding?"

Her expression darkened suddenly, her eyes darting to me with alarm. I put down my makeup wipe, immediately sensing trouble.

"Who is it?" I mouthed.

Sophie covered the receiver and whispered silently, "Elle Sinclair."
Great. Just what I needed after a grueling day of filming-a call from Brandon's psychotic cousin who thought she owned him. I could hear the shrill voice through the phone even from across the room.

"Let me speak to that whore right now!" Elle's voice screamed.

I held out my hand. "Give me the phone."

Sophie passed it over with a look of relief. I took a deep breath, plastering a cold smile on my face even though she couldn't see me.

"Well,well,if it isn't Miss Sinclair," I drawled, leaning back in mny chair."To what do I owe this pleasure? Got nothing better to do than call me?Brandon too busy to entertain you today? Oh wait, I get it-he probably won't eventake your calls anymore,right?"

"You fucking bitch," Elle seethed through the phone. "Don't get too comfortable. You're nothing but a cheap slut who spreads her legs for any man with power. You actually think Brandon has real feelings for you?Get a grip! I'm warning you-stay away from him, or I'll make you regret it!"


I laughed coldly, examining my manicure. "And exactly how do you plan to make me 'regret it.' Miss Sinclair? I find it fascinating how you lose your mind every time Brandon so much as glances at another woman.That's not a healthy habit, you know. And just for the record, there's nothing between Brandon and me-but even if there was, it wouldn't be any of your damn business. Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you supposed to be his *cousin*? A cousin with a crush on her cousin...now *that* would make quite the headline, don't you think?"

"You wouldn't dare!" she shrieked.

"Oh honey, try me," I shot back. "A word of advice-the Taylor family might not be as old money as the Sinclairs, but we're on our home turf
here in New York. Your Washington DC connections don't mean shit in this town."


I ended the call with a smirk, tossing the phone back to Sophie. "What a psycho."


Sophie caught the phone, her eyes wide. "She's completely lost it! I mean,even if she thought something was going on between you and Brandon,who calls someone up and declares war like that? Is she actually insane?"

"Probably," I said, reaching for the makeup remover again. "Can you pass me that? I'm not done yet."

Sophie handed me the bottle. "There's still a dinner meeting with Thomas tonight about *Midnight Echo*. Should I cancel? You've had a long day already."

"Absolutely not," I replied firmly. "This film is a huge opportunity. I'm not missing that meeting."

"You were right about one thing, though," I added, catching Sophie's eye in the mirror.


"What's that?"

"Elle Sinclair is certifiably crazy," I laughed, shaking my head. "Come on,help me finish getting this stuff off. I need to head home and change before dinner."




The backstage area of the press conference buzzed with frantic energy.Assistants darted in every direction, makeup artists made last-minute touch-ups, and PR people huddled in corners, frantically whispering strategy. The announcement of *Midnight Echo* was the industry's most anticipated event of the season, and for good reason.
Not only was the film stacked with A-list talents but the bombshell news that Brandon Stark himself might make an appearance had sent the media into an absolute frenzy.

In New York's elite circles, Brandon Stark was practically mythology-everyone knew his name, his power, his influence, but very few people had actually seen him in person. The man made maybe three public appearances a year,tops.

I sat perfectly still as two stylists fussed over my hair, trying to calm the butterflies in my stomach. I wasn't nervous about the press-I'd handled tougher crowds than entertainment reporters. No, what had my heart racing was the possibility of seeing Brandon.

"Victoria!" Sophie appeared, carrying a garment bag. "Your dress is here.You need to change now-they're starting in twenty minutes."

"Has Brandon arrived yet?" I asked, trying to sound casual.

Sophie shook her head. "Not yet, but you know how he is. The man's running half of Wall Street-he'll probably show up right at the last minute. Can't expect someone like Brandon Stark to sit around waiting backstage." She gave me a once-over, her expression softening. "You look absolutely stunning today. I guarantee all eyes will be on you."

"You think so?" I asked, unable to hide the hope in my voice.

"Definitely," Sophie confirmed.

I was about to thank her when a production assistant burst into the room,looking frazzled.

"Is everyone ready? We're starting infive!"

Sophie jumped into action. "Almost! Just finishing up!" She grabbed my arm and pulled me toward the changing area. "Quick, get into the dress.
The leads go out first, then you're up."

As I slipped behind the screen, I caught my reflection in the mirror.Despite Sophie's compliments, there was no denying the truth-my role as the supporting actress meant exactly that. Supporting. Not leading. Not starring. Second fiddle to Bianca.


Sophie must have noticed my expression falter. "Victoria," she said gently,"you're still young. You have plenty of time. This isn't just any supporting role-it's a scene-stealer. Trust me, after this film, your career is going to soar."


I straightened my shoulders, pushing aside the momentary doubt. "You're right. Hand me the dress-I've got a press conference to rock."
###Chapter 255: Someone Paid You to Do Thi

**Brandon's POV**

I flipped through the quarterly reports on my desk,scanning the numbers with practiced efficiency. Everything looked in order-Stark Tower's third quarter profits were up 12% from last year, exceeding projections by a comfortable margin. A small victory, but I'd take it.

When I stepped out of my office, James and Monica were both staring in the direction where Elle had been lurking. She was already disappearing down the hallway, clearly not wanting to be spotted.

"What are you two looking at?" I asked, though I already knew the answer.

Monica started slightly, caught off guard by my sudden appearance. James,as usual,remained unfazed.


"Mr. Stark, Elle Sinclair-" Monica began.

James cut her off with a subtle shake of his head. "Nothing important, sir."

"Let's go," I said, buttoning my suit jacket. The weight of the small velvet box in my inner pocket was a constant reminder of what truly mattered-not this press conference, not Elle's childish schemes, but the ring I'd just picked up for Summer.

"Yes, Mr. Stark," James replied, falling into step behind me.




In the back of my Bentley, James briefed me on the press conference arrangements as we cruised through midtown Manhattan.

"The venue is ready, sir. Everything's set up exactly as you specified," he reported. "We've controlled media access-mostly our own people are in attendance, though Elle Sinclair's associates have also been allowed in."
I nodded. watching the city blur past outside the tinted windows. "And Victoria?"


"She arrived early for makeup and wardrobe. Everything seems to be proceeding on schedule."


James hesitated, studying my expression. "Sir, your attendance at this press conference... it might fuel the rumors about you and Victoria Taylor. What about Mrs. Stark? How will she feel about this?"


I turned my gaze to him, one eyebrow raised. "Continue."

He shifted slightly, the only visible sign of his discomfort. "I mean, does Mrs. Stark have any concerns about your appearance today, given the recent tabloid stories?"


"That will be your responsibility to manage, won't it, James?" I replied smoothly.


His composure finally cracked. "Mr. Stark, with all due respect, what exactly am I supposed to do? The press will write whatever they want.I can't control what Mrs. Stark thinks about it!"


"You'll figure something out," I said with finality. "Summer won't say anything about this. She understands what we're doing."

James nodded, though he still looked unconvinced. I decided to redirect the conversation.


"Tell the venue we're beginning now. I'll make my entrance last. As for the drama in between..." I gazed out the window, my lips curving into a slight smile. "I'm sure Elle Sinclair will provide us with quite the show."

No sooner had I spoken than James's phone rang.He answered it.listening intently before turning to me.
"That was the backstage coordinator. Victoria's dress has some issues.Apparently, someone tampered with it," he reported, a hint of satisfaction in his voice."Sir, things are about to get very interesting."

I nodded, unsurprised. "Exactly as expected."

The phone rang again almost immediately. James's expression turned more serious as he listened.


"We have a situation, sir." he said after ending the call. "Victoria's outfit has been completely ruined. She's having some kind of allergic reaction.
The press conference has descended into chaos."

"Tell them to maintain control until we arrive," I instructed calmly.


James relayed my orders, then turned back to me. "Mr. Stark, you really don't need to make an appearance at all. We could handle this remotely."

I fixed him with a steady gaze. "Drive faster."

Ten minutes later, we strode into the ballroom where the press conference had devolved into a scene of controlled chaos. Security personnel had formed a perimeter around a young man in hotel staff uniform who looked like he wanted to disappear through the floof. Camera flashes were going off continuously as reporters shouted questions.

Quinn Hall, our head producer, rushed over the moment she spotted me.

"Mr. Stark, thank God you're here," she said, relief evident in her voice. "We've got the situation somewhat under control now."

"What happened?" I asked, scanning the room.

"Victoría had a severe allergic reaction to something on her dress," Quinn explained quickly. "She's been taken to New York Presbyterian for treatment. Her entire body broke out in hives, and she was having trouble
breathing. As for this guy..." She gestured toward the hotel employee surrounded by security. "He was caught sneaking away from Victoria's dressing room."

The hotel manager appeared at my side, practically tripping over himself in his haste. "Mr. Stark, I want to assure you this has nothing to do with us. We've alreadly terminated this individual's employment. If there's anything we can do-"


I held up a hand to silence him, then approached the young man being detained. He couldn't have been more than twenty-five, with disheveled brown hair and a face pale with fear.

"Someone paid you to do this," I stated. It wasn't a question.

The hotel employee swallowed hard, his eyes darting around the room.

"The hotel clearly doesn't pay you enough," I continued, letting my words sink in.


James stepped forward, producing a check for $100,000 from his jacket pocket. I took it from him and held it up where the young man could see it.


"This is yours," I said, keeping my voice low. "Tell me who put you up to this."


The man stared at the check, his eyes widening. He licked his lips nervously.

"It was Miss Sincair," he blurted out. "Elle Sinclair. She gave me ten grand to mess with Victoria Taylor's dress. Said there was some pollen compound that would cause an allergic reaction. She promised another ten when the job was done," He swallowed again. "I swear that's the truth. Mr.Stark."
I nodded. then handed him the check. The reporters surged forward.cameras flashing frantically as they captured the moment. The room erupted in excited chatter.

I caught James's eye and gave him a subtle nod. It was time to leave.Monica was already waiting by the exit, holding the door open.

As we walked out. I could hear the rising tide of gossip behind us. Elle Sinclair's name being repeated in shocked whispers. Exactly as I'd planned.

"The headlines write themselves," James murmured as we stepped into the elevator.


Once we were alone, I allowed myself a real smile. "Make sure Quinn knows what we expect."

"Of course,Mr.Stark."

When we reached the lobby, I kept walking as James stayed behind to tie up loose ends. I heard him call Quinn over.

"Handle the press coverage however you see fit," James instructed her."Just make sure the public relations department coordinates with you. And remember-Mr. Stark wants his headline, no matter what."


Quinn nodded, understanding perfectly. "I'll take care of it personally.Ladies and gentlemen of the press," she announced, turning to the reporters who had followed us down,"jyou have any questions about what just happened, I'm available to answer them all."

James caught up with me at the entrance, where my car was already waiting.

"Where to now, Mr. Stark?" he asked as we slid into the backseat.
###Chapter 256: Put on a Show

**Brandon's POV**

"Hospital," I said, adjusting my cuffs. "Let's go see Victoria."

James nodded,pulling smoothly into traffic.

As we drove, I noticed a black sedan following three cars behind us,making the same turns we did. Amateur hour. My eyes narrowed slightly,and I glanced at James in the rearview mirror. He'd noticed too.

"It seems we have company," James observed quietly, his eyes flicking to the mirror.


I leaned back against the leather seat. "Let them follow. It adds to the performance."

"Performance,sir?"

My eyebrow arched slightly. "Of course. What did you think this was? We're about to put on a show."

James's grip tightened almost imperceptibly on the steering wheel. I knew that look-he was trying to gauge my mood, to determine how upset I really was about this situation.

"Is somethingwrong, Mr. Stark?" he ventured cautiously.

I merely smiled, checking my watch. "Just drive, James. We don't want to keep our audience waiting."

By the time we approached Manhattan General, my phone buzzed with an incoming vídeo message from Sean.I opened it immediately, the volume just loud enough for me to hear clearly.

"I don't *care* what your procedures are!" Victoria's voice blasted through
the speaker, shrill with indignation. "Do you have ANY idea who I am? Or who I *work*for?"


The camera caught her gesturing wildly at a stone-faced doctor and a nurse who looked like she wanted to be anywhere else. Victoria's face wwas visibly swollen. angry red patches covering her neck and what was visible of her chest above her hospital gown.

"If you don't fix this RIGHT NOW," she continued, "Brandon Stark will shut this entire place down! Is that what you want? To lose your job because you couldn't handle a simple allergic reaction?"

The doctor's voice came next, measured and professional. "Ms. Taylor, we've administered antihistamines and steroids. The swelling will subside, but it takes time. There's no magic solution that-"

"Time? TIME? I don't HAVE time! I have a career,you idiot! If my face isn't perfect by tomorrow, I will personally sue this entire hospital!"

The video cut off, and a text message from Sean followed: "Looks like this prima donna showed up at my hospital. How should I handle her?"

I typed back quickly: "Handle it however you want. Keep her there a few days. And make sure her face doesn't heal too quickly."

James cleared his throat. "Sir, we're approaching the hospital now. Should I drop you at the entrance?"

I slid my phone back into my pocket, decision made. "Change of plans.I'm not going in."

"But sir,you said-"

"I know what I said," I cut him off smoothly. "You'll go in my place.Present my... regrets. It's getting late, and I should head home."
James looked genuinely confused now. "If I may ask, sir... why did we come all this way if you weren't planning to go inside?"

"Sometimes the anticipation of a visit can be more effective than the visit itself," I replied cryptically. "You and Monica handle Victoria. I have more important matters to attend to."


James nodded, clearly not satisfied with my explanationbut knowing better than to press the issue. "I understand. We'll take care of it."

As James opened the door, I added,"Oh, and James? Make sure those photographers following us get some good shots of you entering the hospital. We want the right story in tomorrow's papers."




I made a detour to Whole Foods, strolling through the aisles with the unhurried confidence of a man who'd freed up his entire evening unexpectedly. I filled my basket with organic vegetables, prime cuts of pork ribs, and a bottle of Summer's favorite wine. It was barely four-thirty-well over an hour before Summer would typically leave work.

By five-fifteen, I was back at her Manhattan apartment, rolling up my sleeves and getting to work in the kitchen. The rhythmic chopping of vegetables was oddly soothing, allowing my mind to organize the day's events into their proper places. Elle had taken the bait perfectly, moving exactly as I'd predicted. Victoria had played her part, though unwittingly.And Jeffrey Sinclair would soon discover his precious Elle's actions plastered across every gossip column in New York.

I checked the broth-the pork ribs had been simmering for nearly an hour,filling the apartment with a rich aroma. The bone soup Summer loved so much was almost ready. I wiped my hands on a kitchen towel and glanced at my watch: 6:35 PM. Summer would be home soon.
The front door opened at precisely 6:40 PM, and I heard her familiar footsteps in the entryway followed by the soft thud of her bag hitting the floor.


"Brandon?" Summer's voice carried a note of surprise as she followed the scent to the kitchen.


I turned slightly, keeping an eye on the pot. "Welcome home."

She stood in the doorway, still in her wwork clothes, her eyes wide with confusion. "You're... home early? I thought you had that press conference today."

"I did," I confirmed, stirring the soup. "Wash your hands. Dinner's almost ready."


Summer approached cautiously, peering over my shoulder at the stove."You made soup? What kind?"

"Pork rib soup," I answered, lifting the ladle so she could see. "Your favorite."


She inhaled deeply, a smile spreading across her face. "It smells amazing.But wait-weren't you supposed to be at the film announcement? You said you'd be home late."

I turned off the heat and faced her fully. "There was a small change of plans. I went to the venue, but there was an... incident. The press conference was canceled."


Summer's eyebrows shot up. "An incident? What happened?"

"Victoría had an allergic reaction to something on her dress right before the event started," I explained, keeping my tone neutral. "She was rushed to the hospital."
"Allergic reaction?" Summer repeated, her eyes narrowing slightly. "To what?"


"Pollen." I replied. "Someone tampered with her dress. The culprit wwas caught immediately."

Understanding dawned in Summer's eyes. "Victoria's allergic to pollen?That's not common knowledge. Only the Taylor family would know that,or..." She gave me a searching look. "Do you know who did it?"

"The hotel employee confessed on the spot," Isaid,setting out bowls for the soup. "He'd been paid by Elle Sinclair."

Summer bit her lower lip, a habit she had when piecing things together."So you didn't go to the hospital to see Victoria," she said softly. "You came home instead."

"Of course," I replied, ladling the steaming soup into bowls. "Why would I go see her?"


Summer stepped closer, placing her hand on my arm. "Brandon,thank you. For thinking of me."

I reached out, brushing a strand of hair from her face. "Silly girl," I murmured. "You don't need to thank me for that."
###Chapter 257: When Can We Go Public?

**Summer's POV**

Victoria's face hadn't improved much since the allergic reaction. She'd been stuck in the hospital for about a week, and during that time, the internet had been buzzing non-stop about the incident between her and Elle Sinclair.


All the media outlets had been carefully managed by James Wilson. They knew exactly what to say and what to keep quiet about. Meanwhile,the paparazzi Elle had hired were busy attacking Victoria, which prompted Victoria's fans to flood the reporter's social media and websites with angry comments. They even went after Elle's personal websites and information,exposing everything about her in a massive doxxing campaign.

I had to admit, the power of internet was truly impressive. In just one short week, the media narrative had completely shifted. Where they had previously accused Victoria of being shameless, now they were calling Elle"psychotic" and "twisted."


In the midst of all this chaos and drama, Brandon and I were approaching our first Christmas since getting married.

I stared at my phone, Elizabeth's words still ringing in my ears long after the call had ended. This wasn't how I'd planned to start my evening. First Grandpa George's call about Christmas, and now this? I sighed, rubbing my temples as I tried to process what my mother was really asking.


The bathroom door clicked open, releasing a cloud of steam as Brandon emerged with a towel wrapped around his waist. Water droplets clung to his broad shoulders, tracing paths down his chest. Any other time, the sight would have immediately captured my full attention, but tonight my mind was elsewhere,
Brandon's eyes narrowed slightly when he noticed my expression. He crossed the room, plucking the phone from my hand and glancing at the screen.

"Elizabeth Taylor." he read, his voice cooling several degrees.

"Hey." I said softly, standing up and grabbing a smaller towel from the coffee table. I guided him to sit on the sofa and started gently drying his hair, the familiar gesture calming us both.

"Grandpa just called about Christmas, and then my mom followed up right after." I explained, my fingers working through his damp hair.

"Hmm? What did they say?" Brandon asked, his hand finding míne and giving it a gentle squeeze.

"It's about going home for Christmas." I bit my lip, watching his expression carefully. "Don't get mad, okay?"

"Why would I be mad?" he replied, shifting to face me better."What exactly did they say?"

I took a deep breath. "They want me to come home for Christmas, which isn't surprising. But then my mom said... she wants me to bring Dr.Sean with me."


The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. Brandon's expression didn't change much to the untrained eye, but I knew better.His jaw tightened ever so slightly, and that cold, calculating look settled over him-the one that made me think of a predator sizing up prey.

"I didn't agree to anything," I added quickly.

"I'm not angry with you," Brandon said, his voice controlled but intense."June!"
He pulled me into his arms, holding me against his chest. "Did I scare you?I'm not upset with you."

"I know that," I replied, forcing a smile that didn't quite reach my eyes. "I wasn't scared, I just... could you maybe not make that face next time? That cold,calculating look."

"I promise," he said, stroking my cheek with his thumb.

I leaned forward to plant a quick kiss on the corner of his mouth. "Even though I know you're not mad at me, it still makes me uncomfortable when you look like that."

"Alright," he agreed.

"Besides," I continued, looping my arms around his neck, "I just told you what my mom suggested-I never said I was actually going to bring Sean home! That would be crazy."

I explained to Brandon what he might not know-that the real Dr.Sean was the Sullivan family physician. "Can you imagine if I actually showed up with our Dr. Sean? They'd have a collective heart attack!"

Brandon chuckled, tapping the tipof my nose playfully. "You know what?You actually should take Sean with you."


"What? Why?" I pulled back, genuinely confused. "This isn't just about eating Christmas dinner, Brandon. Dr. Sean's identity is pretty significant,and the Sullivan family has serious money and power in New York. That's exactly what they're after! Otherwise, why would they suddenly be nice to me?"


I frowned as I connected more dots. "This is obviously because Victoria is already married. They're trying to set me up with the Sullivan family instead."
"Silly girl," Brandon said, his expression softening. "Don't worry about it.Even if that's your mother's plan, it won't work. The Sullivan family has their own standing-they won't jump just because your mother suggests it."


He tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. "Having Sean go with you is better than having someone we can't control. At least we know where Sean's loyalties lie."


"Wait, are you saying if Sean doesn't come, my mother will find someone else?" My brow furrowed as I considered the implications.

Brandon smoothed the crease between my eyebrows with his thumb. "Don't worry so much. This isn't something you can change anyway."

"So sending Sean with me is currently the best option," he continued, "and your mother isn't going to marry you off to him immediately."

"I guess that's true," I admitted, though something still felt off about the whole situation.


"That's enough overthinking for tonight," Brandon sad,glancing at the clock. "It's getting late. We should get some rest."

I nodded, snuggling against his chest. "So I'll be at the Taylor house for Christmas. What about you? Will you be at the Stark mansion?"

"Yes, it's expected," he replied, his expression darkening slightly. "So, June,when can we go public with our relationship? All this sneaking around means we can't even spend Christmas together."


I cupped his face in my hands, my heart aching at the hint of frustration in his voice. "I promise, once all this drama blows over, we'll announce our relationship right away. And then we'll have a proper wedding ceremony too.How does that sound?"
"Mmm," Brandon hummed, lifting me effortlessly into his arms.

He laid me gently on our bed, and I couldn't help the smile that curved my lips, my eyes crinkling at the corners. I pulled him closer,pressing kisses to his nose, his eyes, his brow, his cheeks, and finally his lips,tugging him down beside me.


Brandon quickly shifted his weight, rolling us so he wouldn't crush me.
We tumbled across the sheets together, laughing softly.
###Chapter 258: Taking Dr. Sean to the Taylor Family

**Summer's POV**

"Summer. this is absolutely ridiculous," Dr. Sean groaned, struggling to balance the tower of shopping bags threatening to topple from his arms."How much more do you plan on buying? My arms are about to fall off!"

I turned from the luxury watch display, suppressing a smile at the sight of him buried under an avalanche of designer bags.

"Just one more stop. I promise," I said, selecting a sleek timepiece. "This would be perfect for Grandpa George."

As the sales associate wrapped the watch, Sean sighed dramatically. "Your grandfather already has more watches than a Swiss collector.You've bought him supplements to keep an army healthy,three cashmere sweaters,and a first-edition book. Isn't that enough?"

I frowned slightly. "It's never enough when it comes to Grandpa George.After everything he's done for me... this is the least I can do."

The truth was, shopping for my family wasn't my favorite way to spend a morning. Especially for a Christmas gathering I was dreading. But gifts were the universal language of the Taylor family-the bigger and more expensive,the better.


As we exited the store, Sean's face peeked out from behind the packages."Hey,you know what? I'm perfectly capable of carrying all this, but you could help a little."

I gasped, suddenly realizing how inconsiderate I'd been. "Oh my God,Sean!I'm so sorry. Here, let me take some of those."

"Forget it," he rolled his eyes. "If Brandon finds out I made you carry
your own shopping bags, I'll never hear the end of it."

My phone rang, cutting off our conversation. Seeing Grandpa George's name, my heart skipped.

"Hi, Grandpa!" I answered cheerfully.

"Summer," his gravelly voice came through. "Where are you? It's getting late. When can we expect you?"

I checked my watch and winced. "I'm so sorry, Grandpa! I'm on my way right now. Just finishing up some shopping. I'll be there soon,I promise!"

After hanging up. I turned to Sean apologetically. "We need to head to the Taylor mansion right away. Grandpa's waiting."

"Let's get these to the car then," Sean sighed. "Your grandfather awaits."

"I'm really sorry for dragging you into all this," I said as we headed to the parking garage.

"Don't sweat it," he replied. "But Summer, you can't dodge this forever.You and Brandon can't keep hiding your marriage. Using me as your beard ísn't a sustainable solution."

I bit my lip, knowing he was right. "I know, I know. It's just...complicated."

"Always is with you Starks," he muttered, then grinned.




The Taylor mansion loomed ahead, decked in tasteful Christmas decorations. White fairy lights wrapped around every tree lining the driveway, and massive pine wreaths adorned each window.

"Wow," Sean whistled as we parked. "You Taylor folks really go all out for
Christmas."

"My mother does." I corrected. "Christmas is her favorite opportunity to remind everyone how important the family is."

Parker, our long-time butler. hurried down the steps to greet us.

"Miss Summer! Welcome home. We've been expecting you." His gaze shifted to Sean, brightening further. "And this must be Mr. Sullivan! Mrs.Taylor mentioned Miss Summer would be bringing her new boyfriend home today."


I froze,mortified.My∗what∗?

Sean maintained his charming doctor smile without missing a beat.

"Mr. Sullivan, please allow me to take care of those packages," Parker offered.


"Parker, just call him Sean," I said quickly. "And yes, Sean,you can hand everything to Parker."

As Parker unloaded the car, Sean pulled me aside.

"'New boyfriend'?" he whispered,eyebrows raised.

"I am so sorry," I whispered back, my face burning. "I have no idea why my mother would say that!"

Sean waved away my apology. "Don't worry."

I blinked, surprised by his casual analysis of my mother's machinations.

"Come on," he said, offering his arm with exaggerated gallantry. "Let's not keep the matchmaker waiting."

Elizabeth Taylor was perched on a Louis XV settee like a queen awaiting
her subjects. The moment we entered, her eyes zeroed in on our linked arms.

"Summer! Mr. Sullivan!" she exclaimed, rising gracefully. "You've finally arrived."


She quickly extracted me from Sean's arm and pulled me into a stiff hug.

"What took you so long?" she whispered harshly, her smile never faltering.

I pulled away and deliberately moved back to Sean's side. "Michael wanted to get something special for Grandpa. Is that a problem, Mother?"

Elizabeth's smile flickered, surprised by my resistance in front of our"guest."

"Of course not," she recovered quickly. "Please, let's sit down. Parker!Bring Mr. Sullivan some tea immediately!"

"Mom," I said firmly, "I'd appreciate if you'd stop telling people that he is my boyfriend, we're just friends. You're making things awkward."

Sean coughed lightly. "Mrs. Taylor must simply be an exceptionally warm hostess who treats everyone like family."

Elizabeth laughed stiffly. "Summer, darling, don't be so sensitive. I'm only looking out for your best interests. You and Sean have known each other for quite some time now, and since he's accompanying you home for Christmas..." She let the implication hang.


Before I could respond, Parker appeared. "Miss Summer, the master requests your presence upstairs. Dr. Sullivan is welcome to join you."

I nearly sagged with relief. "Thank you, Parker. We'll go right up."

As we followed Parker, I could feel my mother's calculating gaze burning into my back.
"Is your grandfather George Taylor or George Washington?" Sean whispered as we climbed the stairs. "I've been in hospitals with less security."

Parker overheard. "Mr. Taylor values his privacy, Mr. Sullivan. May I ask what your specialty is?"

"Actually-" Sean began.

"Parker, he's a friend," I interrupted. "Sean, this is Parker, my grandfather's right-hand man and our family's butler for over thirty years."

"Pleasure to meet you, Parker," Sean extended his hand.

"The pleasure is mine, Mr. Sullivan," Parker replied formnally.

Outside Grandpa's study, Parker paused. "What would you like to drink,
Miss Summer?"

"I'll have whatever Grandpa's having," I replied.

Parker nodded and opened the door. "Miss Summer and Dr. Sullivan, sir."




George Taylor satin his leather armchair by the fireplace, a book open in his lap. He looked up, his weathered face breaking into a genuine smile.

"There's my girl," he said, setting aside his book.

I hurried over and took his hands. "Grandpa! I'm so sorry I'm late."

"Nonsense. You're here now, and that's what matters."

His sharp eyes moved to Sean. "And who mnight this be?"

"Grandpa, this is Brandon's friend, Dr. Sean Sullivan," I introduced. "Sean.this is my grandfather, George Taylor."
"Mr. Taylor, it's an honor to meet you," Sean offered his hand.

Grandpa accepted the handshake, but looked confused. "Sean? I thought Elizabeth mentioned someone named Michael Sullivan."

I glanced at Sean, then back to Grandpa. "No, this is definitely Sean Sullivan. He's one of Brandon's closest friends."

Sean cleared his throat. "The Michael Sullivan you're referring to is likely my cousin, Mr. Taylor. His true name is Jesse Turner. Perhaps you've heard of him?"


The effect was immediate. Grandpa's face went pale, and he gripped his chair tightly.

"Jesse Turner?" he repeated, voice barely above a whisper."Of the Philadelphia Turners?"
###Chapter 259: Your Face Is Hard to Forget

Summer's POV

I nodded, noticing the strange flicker in his eyes."Yes."

My grandpa's face tightened momentarily before smoothing back to its usual composed expression. "Then why would your mother get it wrong?She told me you were bringing Michael Sullivan."

I couldn't help but laugh. "That's the funny part, Grandpa. Mom was the one who introduced me to 'Michael Sullivan' in the first place. But the thing is, she's never actually met him herself. It was all arranged through connections." I gestured toward Sean. "Dr. Sean here has been kindly playing along."

The blood drained from Grandpa's face. "So you're telling me that from the beginning, your mother had no idea who Michael Sullivan was? She's never even met him?"


"Exactly," I confirmed.

Sean cleared his throat. "If I may explain, Mr. Taylor. My aunt Daisy apparently owed Mrs. Taylor a favor from their younger days. Now that my aunt is part of the Sullivan family, Mrs. Taylor thought she'd call in that favor by setting up her daughter with my cousin. But my cousin had zero interest in blind dates, and knowing Summer was already married to Brandon, we came up with this little.,, substitution plan."

I smiled, linking my arm through Grandpa's. "We call it 'Operation Switcheroo.' And don't worry, Brandon knows all about it."

Relief flooded Grandpa's face. "That's good to hear. I was worried Brandon might misunderstand, and it would affect your marriage."

"Brandon trusts me," I assured him. "We're solid."
Grandpa patted my hand affectionately. "I'm an old man now, and my only wish is for you and Brandon to be happy together." His eyes grew sad. "If only your parents weren't so... difficult. You and Brandon might not still be hiding your relationship."

He turned to Sean with an apologetic expression. "I'm sorry for the trouble.Dr. Sullivan. Getting caught up in our family drama can't be pleasant."

I laughed, squeezing Grandpa's hand. "Don't worry about Sean,Grandpa.He's got nothing better to do anyway."

Sean raised an eyebrow. "Taylor family drama is actually quite entertaining compared to hospital rounds," he joked, then grew more serious. "Mr. Taylor, Brandon and Summer are both my friends. Besides,this whole charade partially involves my brother, so I'm happy to help.But truthfully, this isn't a sustainable solution."

"I agree," Grandpa nodded, his brow furrowing with concern. "I worry about Summer getting hurt in all this."

Sean's eyes narrowed thoughtfully7. "I wouldn't worry too much. Summer's smarter than people give her credit for."

I could practically hear what Sean was thinking: if I wasn't exceptional,Brandon "high standards" Stark wouldn't have chosen me. The real issue was that I cared too much about my family, which made me vulnerable to their manipulation.


"Grandpa," I asked, changing the subject, "why did you ask about the Turner family? Do you know them?"

Grandpa's face stiffened again, but he quickly composed himself. "No particular reason. Just curious."

I didn't believe him for a second, but Grandpa had that stubborn set to his jaw that meant further questioning would be pointless. Sean caught my eye,
and I could tell he'd noticed Grandpa's reaction too. Something was definitely off, but neither of us could figureout what.




Downstairs was an entirely different scene. As Sean and I lingered in the stairwell,we overheard Victoria's voice drifting up from the living room.

"Mom, where is everyone? Where's Dad? And Grandpa?" A pause. "What about Summer?"


I couldn't make out Elizabeth's response, but Victoria's voice carried clearly.

"What? Summer brought her boyfriend home? Michael Sullivan from the Sullivan family?"

Sean nudged me, a mischievous glint in his eye. I pressed a finger to my lips, signaling him to stay quiet as we continued to eavesdrop.

Elizabeth's voice became audible now: "That inconsiderate girl! I introduced them, but to bring him to a family gathering without making things official! It's completely inappropriate. She's been spoiled rotten,doing whatever she pleases."

Victoria's syrupy response followed: "You're right, Mom,Summer definitely crossed a line. But maybe... maybe things are serious between them?Maybe there's good news? Summer wouldn't bring him home for Christmas without a reason."


Beside me, Sean was barely containing his laughter. He leaned close to whisper in my ear: "And the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress goes to..."

I suppressed a giggle. "Shh! They'll hear us."

Victoria continued her performance: "I mean, Summer's usually pretty sensible. If she brought him home, it must be important. Don't you think
so,Alex?"

There was a moment of silence, then a flat, "Maybe."

Sean's eyebrows shot up at Alexander's tone. He mouthed,"Your ex?"

I nodded,rolling my eyes.

Victoria quickly filled the awkward silence: "What time will Dad be home?"

Elizabeth's voice turned sickeningly sweet: "Victoria,have you lost weight?And your face-that horrible woman did such damage to you! As if she didn't know how important a woman's face is to her career! Does it still hurt?"


"No, it's much better now," Victoria replied. "The doctor gave me medication, but I have to watch my diet. Alex, don't you think my face looks better?"


"Much better," came Alexander's monotone response."Keep following doctor's orders."


Victoria changed subjects abruptly: "So where's Summer hiding? Alex hasn't met her boyfriend yet!"

Sean turned to me with an amused expression. "Wow. Just... wow. And I thought I was shameless."

I grimaced, embarrassed. "Sorry you have to witness this circus."

"Are you kidding? This is better than reality TV." His eyes sparkled with míschief. "But seriously, are you sure thesepeople are your family?Because you're nothing like them."

I sighed. "Unfortunately, yes. Hard to believe,right?"

"Let's go make our grand entrance." Sean suggested, offering me his arm."
Can't let Victoria have all the fun."

As we descended the stairs. Victoria spotted us and leapt to her feet."Summer! Mr. Sullivan! You're already here? We were just talking about you two."

I tightened my grip on Sean's arm, flashing Victoria a knowing smirk. "Oh,really? What about?"


Victoria's smile faltered for a split second. "Mom was just saying how worried she's been about you being alone while Alex and I are married.Now that Mom's introduced you to such an eligible bachelor, we're all so relieved to see you two getting along so well."

She sidled closer, her eyes fixed on Sean. I noticed her cheeks flushing slightly as she took in his appearance.

"Mr. Sullivan," Victoria purred, batting her eyelashes, "it's so nice to see you again. Do you remember meeting me before?"

Sean's eyes danced with mischief as he regarded Victoria. His trademark lazy smile spread across his face, making his already attractive features even more devastating.

"Your face," he drawled, his gaze lingering on her face,"is very hard to forget."
###Chapter 260: White Lies

Summer's POV

Victoria's hand instinctively flew to her cheek, where patches of redness still lingered from her allergic reaction. Her smile froze as the meaning behind Sean's comment registered. The color drained from her face so quickly I almost felt bad for her. Almost.

She opened her mouth, clearly wanting to snap back, but a quick glance around the room reminded her we had an audience. Instead, she fixed me with a venomous glare that could've wilted the Christmas tree in the corner.

I raised an eyebrow,genuinely surprised by Sean's directness. The man could be charming when he wanted to, but right now he'd opted for something else entirely. I couldn't help the little thrill of satisfaction that ran through me. Brandon's friends definitely had his back-and by extension,mine.


"My sister is a Hollywood actress," I said casually, filling the awkward silence. "She tends to leave quite an impression on people." I turned to Alexander with a small smirk. "That's why my brother-in-law fell so hard for her,right Alex?"

Alexander didn't even blink. He'd been staring at me since we walked in.his eyes tracking every movement as Sean and I stood arm-in-arm.The intensity of his gaze was uncomfortable, like he was trying to decode something written on my skin.

"Yes,of course!" he replied automatically, clearly not having registered a word I'd said.


Victoria's lips thinned into a tight line. Her fingers curled into fists at her sides, knuckles whitening as she struggled between rage and the need to maintain appearances. After a beat, se managed a cold laugh.
"My husband has excellent taste," she said, chin lifting."He naturally only has eyes for someone like me."


"You're absolutely right," I agreed pleasantly, offering no pushback whatsoever.


Victoria blinked, thrown off by my easy agreement. She'd clearly been bracing for a fight that wasn't coming.

Watching her now, married to Alexander, I felt strangely detached. There had been a time when the sight of them together would have crushed me.
I'd spent years nursing feelings for Alexander, believing he was everything I wanted. Now? It was like looking at strangers.

The past few months had showm me exactly who Alexander really was-a man who'd choose status and connections over loyalty every time. A man who'd betrayed me without hesitation when something shinier camealong.The truth was, I didn't want him back. I didn't want anything from him.

The sound of the front door opening interrupted my thoughts. Parker quickly appeared to take a cashmere coat from my father as he stamped the winter chill from his shoes in theentryway.

"Welcome home, Mr. Taylor," Parker said, his voice carrying into the living room.


My father nodded curtly, exchanging a few quiet words with Parker before making his way to us. His eyes swept over Victoria and Alexander before landing on Sean and me with obvious confusion.

"Richard, you're finally home!" my mother exclaimed, rising to greet him with practiced warmth. She gestured toward Sean. "This is MIr.Sullivan-you remember, the one I mentioned? Summner's boyfriend."

My father's brow furrowed. "Summer's boyfriend? So, things are getting serious then?"
I fought the urge to roll my eyes.

I glanced at my mother, making sure she caught my emphasis. "Mother was quite insistent that I bring him along today. The Taylors are just exceptionally hospitable.I suppose?"


Sean smoothly disengaged from me and extended his hand to my father."Mr. Taylor, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Michael Sullivan,though my actual name is Jesse Turner. The Sullivans are my mother's family-Turner is my true surname." He smiled disarmingly. "As it happens, Mrs.Taylor and I have something of a connection!"


The effect of his words was immediate and fascinating. Both my parents'expressions flickered with something between shock and dismay.My mother looked like she'd been slapped, a bright flush spreading across her cheeks. My father recovered more quickly, though his voice was tight as he replied.

"Mr. Turner," he said, the correction deliberate. "Welcome to our home."

"Where's Father?" my dad asked Parker, clearly eager to change the subject.

"I'm right here," came Grandpa George's voice from the stairwell.

We all turned to see him making his way down the steps,leaning heavily on his carved mahogany cane. Though his movements were slow, his eyes remained as sharp as ever, taking in the tableau before him. As his gaze landed on my father, I caught a flash of warning pass between them.

"Well," Grandpa said, his voice stronger than his frail appearance suggested, "now that everyone's here,shall we eat?"

"I'm absolutely starving," my mother announced, clapping her hands together. "Parker, please tell the kitchen to hurry! Everyone, let's move to the dining room,shall we?"
As we filed toward the formal dining room, Grandpa George beckoned to me. "Summer, give an old man your arm, would you?"

I immediately moved to his side, letting him lean on me as we walked.When we reached the dining table, he patted the chair next to his at the head of the table.

"Sit here, dear," he instructed, then turned to Sean. "And Mr. Sullivan, as our guest of honor, please take the seat on my other side. A friend of Summer's deserves the place of distinction, wouldn't you agree?"

Sean inclined his head respectfully. "That's very generous, Mr. Taylor."

The significance of this seating arrangement wasn't lost on anyone. The places next to the family patriarch were always reserved for the most important people at the table-a fact my mother knew all too well,judging by her sour expression.

Once we were all seated and the first course had been served, my mother promptly shattered our family's long-standing rule about avoiding personal discussions at the dinner table.

"So, Summer," she began, her voice dripping with false casualness, "have you and Mr. Sullivan discussed your wedding plans yet?"

Grandpa George set down his fork with a pointed clink. "That's enough,Elizabeth."


My mother had the audacity to look wounded. "Father, I'm just concerned about Summer! Victoria is already married, and I worry about Summer living alone in the city. Wouldn't it be better for her to settle down soon?"

She turned her attention to me, her eyes gleaming with calculation."Summer, don't you think your mother has a point?"

I lowered my gaze to my plate, taking a moment to compose myself.
When I looked back up. I made sure to meet her eyes directly.

"Marriage is important, and yes, traditionally parents should have input,"I said evenly. "But ultimately, each person needs to choose their own life partner. Mr. Sullivan and I barely know each other-we're just friends. We both need to take relationships seriously."


My mother's mouth tightened. "Summer, if you have no interest in Michael,why bríng him home for Christmas? You're giving us alI the wrong impression!"


I tilted my head, the perfect picture of innocence. "But wasn't it you who insisted I bring him,Mother?"
###Chapter 261:I Need to See Brandon

Summer's POV

The tension at the dinner table was suffocating. Each clink of silverware against fine china echoed uncomfortably in the silence that had fallen after Grandpa George shut down my mother's inappropriate wedding comments.I kept my eyes fixed on my plate, pushing around food I had no appetite for.


Mother hadn't spoken since being reprimanded, but her eyes burned into me from across the table. The pristine Taylor family image she so desperately wantedto project was crumbling because of me, and she was seething.

When the dessert plates were finally cleared away, Grandpa George pushed back from the table with a soft sigh.

"Mr. Sullivan," he said, his weathered face creasing into a genuine smile,"would you care to join me for a game of chess? I find it aids digestion far better than awkward family conversation."

Sean's eyes lit up. "I'd be delighted, Mr. Taylor."

"Summer," Grandpa added, turning to me, "you'll join us too, won't youa?"

I nodded gratefully, eager for any excuse to escape the dining room. "Of course,Grandpa."


Grandpa's room was my favorite place in the Taylor mansion-a sanctuary of leather-bound books, the scent of pipe tobacco, and treasured memories.The elaborate chess set was already set up by the fireplace, and Parker had left a silver tea service nearby.

"Allow me," I said, moving to prepare the tea while Grandpa and Sean settled at the chess table.
To my surprise-and clearly to Grandpa's as well-the game progressed rapidly in Sean's favor. Within thirty minutes. Grandpa was staring at the board in open amazement.

"Checkmate." Sean said softly, his finger resting lightly on his queen.

Grandpa leaned back, shaking his head with a rueful smile. "It seems this old man can still be caught off guard. Your skill is remarkable, Mr.Sullivan."


Sean shrugged modestly. "It's nothing special, really. Brandon's the one who trained me. He has no patience for mediocre opponents."

I laughed unexpectedly. "Sean, I don't think you realize-my grandfather is a chess enthusiast. If Brandon and he haven't already played, I'd be shocked." I turned to Grandpa with a teasing smile. "It seems you've finally met your match, haven't you?"

Grandpa accepted the cup of tea I offered him. "Not bad at all,"he approved, both of the tea and, I suspected, of Sean's abilities.

"Excuse me for a moment," I said. "I need to use the restroom. I'll be right back."


The upstairs hallway was dimly lit. As I passed my father's study,I noticed light spilling from beneath the door. A sharp edge to my mother's voice made me pause.

"I can't believe that ungrateful little brat!" My mother's voice, no longer coated in social nicety, was cold with fury. "After everything we've done for her, she's clearly trying to use Michael Sullivan to break free from this family!"

"Elizabeth, keep your voice down," my father warned, his tone hushed but insistent.
"I should never have introduced him to her!" Mother continued. "Victoria could have made so much more of that connection."

"Elizabeth!" My father's voice sharpened.

"Don't 'Elizabeth' me, Richard! You know I'm right. That worthless girl has been nothing but trouble since the day we brought her home.God,I regret ever agreeing to take her in!"

My heart stopped. *Take her in?* A strange buzzing filled my ears as I pressed closer to the door.


"Lower your voice," my father hissed. "And we've discussed this-we are never to speak of that again."

"It's just so infuriating!" my mother continued, though slightly quieter now."We only adopted her for Thompson's inheritance, and what has she given us in return? Nothing but headaches! She's not even our real daughter-why should I pretend to care about her the way I do Victoria?"

"Because," my father's voice was strained with barely contained anger,"regardless of how you feel about her birth mother, Summer holds shares we need. Or have you forgotten that detail in your spite?"

The world tilted beneath my feet. *Not their real daughter. Adopted.Shares they need.*

Each word hit like a physical blow, shattering everything I thought I knew about myself. I stumbled backward, my elbow knocking against a decorative vase, which wobbled precariously.

The voices inside the study immediately fell silent.

"Did you hear something?" my mother asked sharply.

I froze,paralyzed with panic. The door handle turned.
Just as the door began to open, a strong hand clamped over my mouth while another arm wrapped around my waist, yanking me backward into the shadows of an adjoining hallway. Sean's body shielded mine from view.

"Richard, I definitely heard something," my mother insisted from the doorway.

A soft thud and skittering of claws drew their attention away.

"There's your noise," my father said. "Just that stray cat Parker keeps feeding."

Their footsteps retreated, followed by the soft click of the study door closing.

Only then did Sean release me, his worried eyes searching my face."Summer?"


But I couldn't respond. My body felt disconnected, like I was floating outside myself. The revelation echoed in my mind, shattering and reforming with each repetition.

*Not their daughter. Never was. A transaction. Unwanted.*

"Summer!" Sean's voice seemed to come from very far away.

I barely registered his hands on my shoulders, gently shaking me. I stared blankly at his face, unable to process anything beyond the deafening roar in my head.

"Summer, I'm sorry for grabbing you like that," he apologized. "Summer?"

Something in his tone finally pierced through the fog. I blinked,reality crashing back with brutal force.

"Sean," I whispered, my voice cracking. "I need to see Brandon.I need to see Brandon right now."
Sean's brow furrowed with worry. "But Brandon's at the Stark mansion tonight. It's Christmas Eve-there's a strict family tradition. He probably can't leave-"

"No." I cut him off, desperation clawing at my chest. "I don't care. I need to see Brandon, even if I have to go to the Stark house. I *need* to see him!11


"Okay, okay," Sean said, raising his hands in a placating gesture. "We'll see Brandon. But we should at least say goodbye to your grandfather first. He'll worry if we just disappear."

Before I could respond, a familiar voice called out from down the hallway.

"There you are!" Victoria's saccharine tone made my skin crawl. "We've been looking everywhere for you two!"

She glided toward us, Alexander trailing behind her like a reluctant shadow. My head throbbed as I tried to focus on her face-my not-sister,the daughter they'd actually wanted.

"We have to leave," Sean said smoothly,positioning himself slightly in front of me. "Something's come up. Please extend our apologies to the rest of the family."

Victoría's practiced smile didn't falter, but her eyes narrowed slightly."Leaving so soon? But the night's just getting started!"

"Unavoidable, I'm afraid," Sean replied, his tone brooking no argument.He placed a steady hand at the small of my back, gently guiding me forward.

We left them frozen in mutual hostility, Sean practically carrying me down the stairs and out into the bitter December night. The moment we cleared the front door, my legs gave out completely.

"Summer!" Sean crouched beside me, alarm evident in his voice. "What's
going on? What happened back there?"



The cold air against my face finally broke the dam. Tears streamed down my cheeks as I gasped for breath between sobs.



"Sean," I choked out, clutching at his coat. "Please... I need to see Brandon.I need to see him right now."
###Chapter 262: A Fate Worse Than Death

Brandon's POV

The Stark mansion buzzed with forced laughter and clinking crystal.Christmas Eve dinner had morphed into what it always was-a business gathering thinly disguised as a family celebration. I nursed my scotch,scanning the room filled with New York's elite: board members,business partners, family associates. This year's unwelcome addition: Jane Sinclair and her "daughter" Elle.

Elle hadn't stopped watching me all evening, her gaze following my every move. I'd deliberately positioned myself across the room, limiting our interaction toa cold greeting hours ago.

My father worked the room with practiced ease while Uncle Gavin looked as uncomfortable as I felt. I accepted another drink from a passing waiter just as my phone vibrated. One glance at the screen made my stomach drop.


Sean.

He wouldn't call during Christmas Eve unless something was wrong.Very wrong.


I stood abruptly, drawing curious glances as conversations died around me.

"Excuse me. I need to take this call," I announced, my voice cutting through the silence, "Please,continue."

In a quieter corner, I pressed the phone to my ear. "What happened?"

"Brandon," Sean's voice was tight with tension. "We've got a situation. It's Summer. She's not in good shape."

My grip tightened. "What do you mean? Is she hurt?"
"Not physically," he replied. "Something went down at the Taylor house.I don't know exactly what, but it's bad."

"Explain. Now."

Sean lowered his voice. "We were playing chess with her grandfather when she went to use the bathroom. I found her later outside Richard's study,completely shell-shocked."

My heart accelerated."And?"

"Richard and Elizabeth Taylor came out of that room. Summer won't tell me what she heard, but she practically collapsed afterward. She's...Brandon, I've never seen her like this. She keeps saying she needs to see you.Only you."

The pieces clicked. "She overheard something about herself."

"I think so," Sean confirmed. "She's barely holding it together."

"Where are you now?"

"Heading back to Manhattan. Brandon-" His voice cut off with a curse."Shit, she's... Summer, hey, stay with me. You needto-

"I'm coming now," I cut him off. "Text me your location."

I pocketed my phone and turned toward the exit, only to find Elle blocking my path.

"Brandon, where are you going?" she asked loudly, drawing attention.

I moved to step around her as my father's voice cut through the silence.

"Brandon. Where do you think you're going?"

I faced him, keeping my expression neutral despite the urgency pounding
through me. "I have business to attend to. I'll be back shortly."

My father's eyes narrowed. "Business? On Christmas Eve? Whatever it is can wait until tomorrow."

"It can't." I replied, already turning away.

"Uncle Brandon!" Angela darted away from Sarah,her small shoes clicking against marble as she grabbed my pant leg. "Where are you going? Aren't you going to play with me?"

I crouched to her level, the tension in my body momentarily softening."Angela, sweetheart, Uncle has to take care of something important. I'll be back soon to play with you,okay?"

Her bottom lip jutted out. "But you promised we'd build a snowman!"

"And we will," I assured her, brushing a strand of hair from her face. "Just a little later than planned."

"Can I come with you?" she asked hopefully.

I shook my head. "Not this time, princess."

Sarah stepped forward, extending her hand to Angela. "Come on, sweetie.Let's find some dessert."

Angela motioned for me to bend closer. When I did, she planted a wet kiss on my cheek, "There! I've sealed it with a kiss. Now you have to come back soon!"


Despite everything, I smiled. "I promise, Angela. Uncle never breaks his word to you."

As I straightened to leave, Elle lunged forward, wrapping her arms around my waist from behind.
"Brandon. please don't go!" she cried, clinging to me. "It's Christmas Eve!Whatever it is can wait!"

I went rigid. "Let go of me. Now."

"No!" She tightened her grip. "I won't let you leave!"

Whispers rippled through the room. I felt my control slipping. "I said, let go."

"No.Brandon," she insisted, her voice taking on that grating whine."You can't just walk out on Christmas-"

"Last warning," I growled. "Take. Your. Hands. Off. Me."

"I won't!" she declared.

In one fluid motion, I broke her hold and spun around, my hand closing around her throat. I lifted her slightly-just enough that she had to balance on her toes-her eyes widening in shock.

Elle gasped and clutched at my wrist, her face rapidly flushing. "Bran-"she choked.


"Brandon!" Jane Sinclair's horrified scream cut through the stunned silence.
She rushed forward, face ashen. "What are you doing? Let her go! She's
your cousin!"

A cold smile curved my lips, "Cousin? Since everyone's here, why don't we clarify the exact nature of my relationship with Elle Sinclair?"

"No!" Jane gasped. "Brandon, please, not now-"

"What's the matter, *Mrs. Sinclair*?" I drawled. "Afraid of what the family might hear?"

My father stepped forward, expression thunderous. "Brandon, release her
immediately!"

Elle's fingers scrabboled weakly against my hand. "Please," she wheezed.

I leaned closer, my voice for her ears alone. "Are you afraid of dying,Elle?You should be. I'm offering you two choices-death, or a fate worse than death. Which would you prefer?"

Tears streamed down her face as she shook her head frantically.

Elle mouthed my name.

"Don't say my name," I hissed. "Every time you say it, I want to wash my ears out with bleach."


With a final surge of contempt, I released her, shoving her away. She collapsed in a heap, coughing and gasping, mascara streaking down her cheeks.


"Brandon," she rasped between desperate gulps of air. "You can't mean this. You wouldn't treat me this way."

I removed my jacket, which her touch had contaminated, and dropped it on the floor. James appeared, silently offering a handkerchief. I wiped my hands as if removing something foul, then discarded the cloth next to my jacket.

"Try me," I said coldly. "I won't kill you-that would be too merciful. But I promise you this: cross me again, and I'll make you wish for death as a release."
###Chapter 263: You Are My Wife, Brandon
Stark's WVife

Brandon's POV

Without another word, I turned and strode toward the exit. Behind me,I heard Elle struggling to her feet.

"Brandon, wait!" she called out, her voice still rough from my grip.


I didn't bother turning around. The sound of Jane's sharp command carried through the hall.

"Elle! Stay where you are!"

I continued walking, but could hear their heated exchange.

"Auntie," Elle's voice broke with desperation, "what Brandon said... it's not true,is it? He's lying, right? He's just trying to hurt me..."

Jane's voice was strained, clearly struggling to maintain her composure after being so publicly humiliated by her own son. I allowed myself a cold smile as I reached the grand foyer.

"Brandon." My father's authoritative voice rang out.

I paused, not turning around.

"Don't," Sarah's voice cut in. "Father, please."

"Sarah,Brandon is-"

"Brandon isn't a child anymore," Sarah insisted. "Everything he does has a reason behind it."


My father sighed heavily. "Fine, then."
I pushed through the heavy oak doors, the winter air hitting my face like a slap. My car was already waiting at the bottom of thesteps.James Wilson appeared at my side, breathing hard from rushing after me.

"Sir, what's happened? Is everything alright?"

"Don't follow me," I ordered, pulling open the car door. "Stay here and watch the house. I want to see who still dares associate with the Sinclairs after tonight."


James's expression registered surprise, but he nodded immediately. "Of course,Mr.Stark."


I paused, one foot in the car. "If necessary, increase the pressure. Make sure everyone understands the consequences."

A thin smile spread across James's face. "Understood, Mr. Stark."

As I slid behind the wheel, I caught sight of Elle bursting through the mansion doors, frantically scanning the driveway. The engine roared to life.and I pulled away without a backward glance.

I accelerated down the long driveway, leaving the mansion and its drama behind. As soon as I hit the main road, I pressed the gas pedal to the floor and pulled out my phone, dialing Sean.

"Where are you now?" I demanded the moment he answered.

"We're on our way," Sean replied, his voice tense even through the speakerphone. "Heading to Summer's apartment-"

"No!" Summer's voice cut in, sounding raw and desperate."Not the apartment. I want to go to the Hamptons estate. Sean,take me to the Hamptons!"

I could hear Sean's hesitation. "Well, that's...the Hamptons is..."
"Sean," I cut in sharply. "Take her to the Hamptons estate. Now."

"Right, on it."

"Put Summer on the phone," I ordered.

There was a rustling sound as the phone changed hands.

"Summer." I said, softening my voice. "Let Sean take you home. I'm on my way. I'll be there soon."


"Okay," she replied, her voice small but determined. "I'll wait for you.Brandon, I'll always wait for you."

She hung up, and I pressed harder on the accelerator, pushing well beyond the speed limit. The roads were nearly empty on Christmas Eve,allowing me to make the journey in record time.

By the time I arrived at the Hamptons estate, Sean's car was already parked out front. I barely took the time to shut off the engine before striding through the front door.

"Where's Summer?" I demanded.


Sean was pacing in the foyer, looking relieved to see me. He jerked his thumb toward the staircase. "Upstairs. And honestly, I have no idea what happened tonight. She's been acting strange since we left the Taylor mansion.Something's very wrong."

"Thank you for calling me," I said, moving toward the stairs. "You can go now."


Sean hesitated. "Actually, I noticed something on my way in. There are people watching the estate. Someone's got eyes on you-surveillance outside the gates."

I paused, hand on the banister. "Then stay here tonight. There are guest
rooms on the first and second floors. Take your pick."

I took the stairs two at a time, my heart pounding against my ribs. At the master bedroom, I pushed the door open without knocking.

Summer was sitting on the floor, knees pulled up to her chest, arms wrapped tightly around them. She looked up when I entered, her eyes red-rimmed and filled with a desperation that made my chest ache.

I crossed the room in three strides and lifted her into my arms. "Brandon!"she gasped, relief flooding her voice as she clutched at my shirt. "Brandon,you're here!"

"I'm here," I confirmed, carrying her to the bed and setting her down gently. I pulled the comforter over her, frowning when I felt how cold her feet were. "Why are you barefoot on the floor? It's the middle of winter."

Summer's lips trembled, her expression so wounded that I immediately regretted my harsh tone.

"I'm not angry," I said more softly, sitting beside her. "I was just worried."

"Brandon," she whispered, her fingers digging into my arm. "Don't leave me. Please, don't leave me."

I pulled her against my chest, one hand cradling the back of her head."I won't. I will never leave you."

She clung to me like a drowning person, her body trembling with emotion.I held her silently, offering the comfort of my presence as minutes stretched into a half hour. Her grip never loosened.

"Summer," I finally said, "I'm not going anywhere. You can let go."

"No," she refused, burying her face deeper against my shoulder.

"I'm not trying to leave," I explained patiently. "I just want to lie next to
you,that's all."

She hesitated, then slowly released her grip and shifted to the side,pulling back a corner of the comforter. "Lie here," she commanded softly.

I complied, settling beside her on the bed. Immediately, she grabbed my hand and wrapped her other arm around my waist, burrowing into the shelter of my body.

"T'm here," I murmured, stroking her hair. "I'm right here. You're safe."

Gradually, her breathing evened out, but her eyes remained open, watching me with an intensity that suggested she was afraid I might disappear if she blinked.


"Are you going to tell me what happened today?" I asked finally.

Summer's gaze dropped, focusing on my collar instead of my face.

"Summer," I said firmly, tilting her chin up. "I'm your husband, remember?



She bit her lip, her expression painfully vulnerable. "Brandon, what if..."she paused, voice barely above a whisper. "What if I'm not really a Taylor?If I don't even know who I am... would you still want me? Or would you reject me because my identity is... unknown?"

I went still, processing the implications of her question. Her anxiety grew in the silence, prompting her to backpedal.

"I'm just saying hypothetically," she hurried to explain. "Brandon, I-"

"Summer," I cut her off, my voice low and deliberate. "You are you.Whether you're a Taylor or not doesn't change who you are. Do you understand?"


Her eyes searched mine, seeking reassurance."Really?"
"You are my wife." I said firmly. "Brandon Stark's wife. That's all that matters
###Chapter 264: All For Her

Brandon's POV

"Brandon. I..." Her voice faltered. the words catching in her throat.

I immediately tightened my arms around her, drawing her closer to my chest. My hand moved in gentle cireles across her back, a soothing rhythm I'd learned calmed her.


"Hey, silly girl," I murmured against her hair. "I'm right here. I'll always be by your side."

I felt her body gradually relax as she nestled deeper into my embrace,absorbing my warmth. Her head rested in the crook of my neck,her breath warm against my skin.

"Mmm," she hummed softly, a small acknowledgment that pierced straight through my chest.

I continued stroking her back, the repetitive motion as much for my benefit as hers. The protective instinct surging through me was almost overwhelming-seeing her this broken, this vulnerable, ignited something primal inside me.


"Ready to tell me what you heard now?" I asked gently.

The silence stretched between us. I glanced down to find her looking up at me, her eyes reflecting a storm of emotions-fear, confusion, hurt,uncertainty-all swirling together.

"Not yet?" I asked, understanding her hesitation without needing words."That's fine. Get some sleep. You can tell me whenever you're ready,alright?
0

Relief washed over her features. "Thank you, Brandon," she whispered.
She shifted slightly, reaching up to press a soft kiss to the corner of my mouth. I turned my head, catching her lips with mine for a brief moment.


"Sleep now." I whispered against her ear. "Everything will be better when you wake up."


Only when I was absolutely certain she was deeply asleep did I carefully extract myself from her grasp. She made a small sound of protest but didn't wake as I tucked the covers around her and quietly left the room.




The house was unnaturally quiet as I made my way downstairs. As I approached the darkened living room, the acrid scent of cigarette smoke greeted me.


Sean sat in the shadows, the burning end of his cigarette glowing orange in the darkness. I reached for the light switch, flooding the room with soft light.

Sean squinted up at me, cigarette dangling between his fingers."Well,you look like shit," he observed bluntly.

I glanced down at my rumpled clothes and couldn't argue with his assessment. Sean held out a cigarette, offering it to me with a questioning eyebrow.


"Rough night?" I asked, accepting the cigarette but not lighting it.

"Like you're having a fucking picnic," he retorted, then his expression sobered. "What's going on with Summer? I've never seen her like that.I'd barely stepped into the hallway when I saw Summer looking like she'd seen a ghost. I heard voices from the study,grabbed her, and got the hell out of there." He paused, studying my face. "You think it's about her background? Her real parents?"
I nodded slowly.

Sean continued. "You know, this isn't exactly news to you, is it? You had Edward looking into her background months ago. I heard something about that."

"She was... different tonight." I said quietly. "Whatever she overheard hit her hard."


I pulled out my phone and dialed Edward. He answered on the fourth ring, his voice thick with sleep.


"Summer's background. What have you found?" I asked without preamble.

There was a pause on the other end. "It's been a bitch to trace.Someone's gone to a lot of trouble erasing and altering records." Edward's voice turned thoughtful. "Which is interesting in itself. Nobody bothers covering tracks unless there's something worth hiding."

I pinched the bridge of my nose, impatience rising. "I need answers now.Edward. What do you have?"

"Summer isn't Richard and Elizabeth's biological daughter, that much I've confirmed,"Edward replied. "It validates your earlief suspicion. She isn't a Taylor by blood."


I already suspected as much, but hearing it confirmed still sent a jolt through me. "What else?"


"Here's where it gets odd," Edward continued. "George Taylor and Professor Thompson both show extraordinary affection for her. Not the kind you'd expect for a random adopted child."

"So Richard and Elizabeth taking her in was deliberate," I summarized."Not some charitable impulse."
"Bingo." Edward confirmed. "Look, you might be betteroff asking George Taylor or Professor Thompson directly. They'd know more than anything I can dig up in databases."


He paused. then added. "Oh, and one more thing.Your esteemed professor-Summer's grandfather Thompson? He has some fascinating connections to the Turner family in Philadelphia."

My interest sharpened. "What kind of connections?"

"Still piecing that together," Edward admitted. "But it's not casual. I'll keep digging."

I ended the call and looked up to find Sean watching me with undisguised curiosity.


"The Philadelphia Turners," I said,watching his reaction carefully.

Sean's easy demeanor instantly tensed. "Why the hell are you looking at me like that? It's creeping me out."

"Your cousin is a Turner," I reminded him.

Sean shifted uncomnfortably. "Yeah,and?"

A connection was forming in my mind-Thompson, Turner,Summer's unknown parentage. There was a pattern here, just beyond my grasp.

Sean suddenly straightened. "Wait a minute. A few Turners somehow left the family and change their names many yeas ago. You see, my cousin Jesse Turner, he is also a Sullivan. What if Professor Thompson is actually Professor Turner?" He looked at me with dawning realization. "You don't think...she'sconnected to the Turners somehow?"

My mind was racing through possibilities. If Professor Thompson were originally a Turner, it would explain certain anomalies. And if Elizabeth
had raised Summer to leverage connections to both families... it was starting to make sense.

"Man, Summer's family situation is more twisted than a fucking pretzel,"Sean observed. "But hey, if she's got Turner blood, that makes your marriage even more convenient, right? One more power alliance for the mighty Stark empire."


I fixed him with a cold stare. "Even if she had no family connections whatsoever. I'd make sure she took her rightful place in the Stark family.My wife doesn't need anyone's backing but mine."

Sean raised his hands in surrender. "Easy, tiger. I know you're the big bad wolf of Wall Street. No need to remind me."

I fell silent, considering my next move carefully. After a long pause, I asked,"What kind of drug could cause immediate psychological instability?



Sean dropped his cigarette, burning his fingers. "Jesus! Fuck!" He shook his hand, then stared at me with genuine shock. "Are you serious?"

"Do I look like I'm joking?" I asked coldly.

Sean studied me for a long moment.

I didn't respond directly. My priority had always been clear-ensuring Summer could take her place in the Stark family without any complications or distractions. The Sinclairs had been a thorn in my side for too long.

"You've changed, you know that?" Sean said quietly. "When you first got with Summer, I thought it was just because she reminded you of-"

"I've always known exactly what I want," I cut him off, my voice hard and final. "From the very beginning until now, it's only been her. No one else."
I crushed the unlit cigarette in my hand and tossed it into the trash.Rising to my feet. I looked down at Sean.

"Give the details to James," I instructed. "He'll know what to do."
###Chapter 265:I Was Blind

Jane's POV

Word traveled fast in New York high society. What happened on Christmas Eve at the Stark mansion had already become the juiciest gossip of the season. My son-my Brandon-had publicly humiliated Elle.

My phone buzzed for the third time in an hour. Jeffrey again. I sighed,knowing I couldn't avoid him forever. Reluctantly, I answered.

"Jane, what the hell is going on there?" Jeffrey's voice boomed through the speaker, his Washington drawl more pronounced when he was agitated. "I m hearing that Brandon nearly choked Elle to death at the Christmas party?"

"Jeffrey," I said carefully, "about Elle's situation with Brandon... maybe we should just let it go."

The silence on the other end was deafening.

"What did you just say?" His voice dropped dangerously low. "Have you lost your mind, Jane? Elle and Brandon's marriage was decided years ago.You agreed to it! After what Brandon did to Elle in Washington, he refuses to take responsibility?"

I gripped the phone tighter. "Jeffrey! No one really knows what happened that night in Washington, Brandon and Elle tell completely different stories. Do you honestly think Brandon is the type of man who would take advantage of Elle and then deny it?"

"He's your son," Jeffrey spat. "Of course you'd defend him. But don't forget.Jane,you're a Sinclair now. Have you forgotten how the Starks treated you? The Sinclairs took you in when you were at your lowest. That's a fact!
His words cut deep, reopening old wounds I'd spent decades trying to heal.

"I know!" I snapped, my voice cracking. "You don't need to remind me!Jeffrey, stop throwing that in my face every chance you get!"

I took a deep breath, steadying myself. "Look, if you want any chance of peace between the Stark and Sinelair families, drop this marriage nonsense.Brandon is my son. I know him. If you keep pushing this, I can't predict what he'll do next!"

The door to my bedroom suddenly burst open. Elle stood in the doorway,her face contorted with rage, mascara streaking down her cheeks. My phone slipped from my fingers,clattering to the floor.

"Aunt Jane," she hissed, her voice dripping with venom. "What díd you just say?"

"Elle," I stepped toward her, hands raised placatingly. "Sweetheart,listen to me. There are plenty of eligible men out there. I can introduce you to-"

"Enough!" she screamed, her entire body trembling. "It was all lies, wasn't it? All that bullshit about caring for me, about helping me win Brandon.You've been lying to me this whole time!"

"Elle, please," I pleaded, "you heard what Brandon said at the party. He's never going to marry you. If you keep pushing this, he might go after the entire Sinclair family.Elle-"

"Let him!" she screeched, her eyes wild. "The Sinclairs aren't afraid of the Starks! Brandon is mine. He belongs to me and no one else."

She backed toward the door, her face eerily calm despite the tears streaming down her cheeks. "If you won't help me. I'll do it myself."

Before I couldI stop her, Elle turned and fled down the hallway. I ran after her, but she slammed her bedroom door shut and locked it. Through the
heavy oak. I could hear the sickening sound of something-or someone-repeatedly hitting the wall.

"Elle!" I pounded on the door. "Open up. please! Elle. listen to me!"

Panic gripped me as I heard what sounded like convulsions. Frantic, I kept shouting her name. desperately trying to get her to respond.

"What's going on here?"

I whirled around to find Robert standing at the top of the stairs, his expression a mixture of annoyance and concern.

"Robert!" I grasped his arm without thinking. "Please, help me get this door open! Something's wrong with Elle! She's been emotionally unstable since Christmas, after what Brandon did. I'mn afraid she might hurt herself.Please, open the door!"

Robert looked pointedly at my hand clutching his sleeve. I immediately let go,stepping back.

"Stand aside," he ordered.

With one powerful kick, the door flew open. Elle lay on the floor,her body jerking violently, eyes rolled back in her head.

"Her medication!" I gasped. "There are pills on my nightstand. Elle's medication!"


Robert rushed to my room and returned with two unmarked pill bottles.He looked at them suspiciously. "What are these? Does Elle really have mental-"


"Just give them to me!" I snatched the bottles from his hand. "This isn't the time for questions!"

Together, we managed to get the pills into Elle's mouth. Gradually、her
convulsions subsided, her body going limp.

"Can you help me get her onto the bed?" I asked, exhaustion evident in my voice.


Robert lifted Elle's unconscious form with surprising gentleness, placing her on the rumpled sheets. Once she was settled. he gestured for me to follow him into the hallway.


"Brandon's position is clear," he said without preamble. "He will never marry Elle. Even if she didn't have psychological issues, he wouldn't choose her. Brandon is the Stark heir, the future CEO. The future Mrs.Stark will not be Elle Sinclair."

I laughed bitterly. "Then who? Lyanna York? That woman who slept around and had a child with God knows who? Robert, after all these years,you're still as selfish as ever!"

"Me? Selfish?" Robert's eyes narrowed. "Brandon is your son too. Do you even know what he wants? All I know is that Brandon will absolutely never marry Elle Sinclair. If it's not Lyanna, it still won't be Elle. I'vesaid my piece. Do what you will with it."

"You..." I clenched my fists, hatred bubbling up inside me. "Robert,you...if it weren't for your underhanded tactics back then, I never would have-"

"Enough," he cut me off coldly. "I have no interest in rehashing ancient history. All I can say is that I was blind to have ever married you."

He turned to leave, then paused. "One more thing. Brandon isn't me. The tricks you and Jeffrey pulled on me back then won't work on him, If you insist on pushing this, what I stopped short of doing back then... well, I wouldn't mind if Brandon finished the job."

I watched him walk away, his broad shoulders disappearing down the grand staircase.Alone in the dimly lit hallway, I stared out at the bleak
New York winter landscape, memories flooding back-memories of hopes crushed and dreams deferred.


"Robert." I whispered to the empty corridor, "you stopped me from marrying Gavin back then. Do you really think you can stop Ele from marrying Brandon now?"

I clutched the pill bottle in my hand, its contents rattling softly as I walked back into Elle's room. She lay peacefully now, her chest rising and falling in steady rhythm. I sat beside her, gently stroking her pale face.

"Elle," I promised softly, "I will help you. I won't let them stop you from doing what I couldn't do back then."
n ###Chapter 266: The Most Painful Conversatio

Summer's POV

I arrived early at the high-end tea house in Manhattan, my heart hammering against my ribs with such force I was sure the staff could hear it. The private room was exactly as requested-secluded, elegant, with soft lighting that wouldn't aggravate Grandpa's sensitive eyes. I'd personally selected his favorite tea, ensuring everything was perfect.

Perfect for what might be the most painful conversation of my life.

My fingers trembled slightly as I arranged the teacups. Even after Brandon had comforted me on Christmas Eve, the revelation that I wasn't truly Elizabeth and Richard's daughter had left me reeling. For days, I'd been in a fog of confusion and hurt, wrestling with questions that consumed my every waking moment.

Who was I, really? Where did I come from? And why had everyone kept this from me?


The gentle knock at the door jolted me from my thoughts. I smoothed my dress, took a deep breath, and tried to put on a brave face.

"Come in," I called, my voice surprisingly steady.

The door opened to reveal Parker, helping Grandpa George into the room.My throat instantly tightened at the sight of him-his familiar stance, the silver-topped cane, the kind eyes that had always looked at me with such warmth.


"Grandpa!" I couldn't stop myself from rushing forward,eyes already welling with tears.

"My dear!" His face lit up, arms opening to receive my embrace."It's only been a few days, and you're already missing me this much?"
I hugged him tightly, breathing in his comforting scent of expensive cologne and peppermint. "Of course! Haven't you missed me too?"

Grandpa pulled back slightly, studying my face with concern. "What's this?You look like you're about to cry." His weathered hand gently cupped my cheek. "Is seeing your old grandpa making you that happy?"

"Yeah." I managed, forcing a smile even as my throat burned with unshed tears. "Just really happy."

I helped him to the plush chair I'd arranged closest to the heating vent,knowing how the winter chill aggravated his joints. Parker quietly excused himself, leaving us alone.

Grandpa settled in with a contented sigh, then fixed me with a knowing look. "So, you asked me to meet you here. Must be something important on your mind?"

My carefully rehearsed speech suddenly evaporated. I poured tea with hands that wouldn't quite stay steady, buying myself precious seconds to regain my composure.

"Grandpa," I began, setting down the teapot, "there is something I wanted to ask you about."

"Go ahead," he encouraged, lifting his teacup. "Perhaps I can help clarify whatever's troubling you."

I took a deep breath, then looked directly into his eyes. "Grandpa, I'm not really a Taylor by blood, am I?"

The reaction was immediate. Grandpa's hand jerked,hot tea sloshing over the rim of his cup onto the tablecloth. His face paled dramatically.

"I'm fine!" he insisted, waving away my concern as I jumped up to help."Just clumsy old hands."
I slowly sat back down, my suspicion confirmed by his reaction. "You don't need to hide it anymore. I know the truth."

"Know what?" His voice had a forced casualness that broke my heart."What could you possibly know that I don't? And how would you know it?"

"I overheard Dad and Mom talking in the study on Christmas Eve," I admitted quietly. "I heard everything."

Grandpa's expression cycled through shock, dismay, and finally settled on something like resignation. Still, he tried one last defense. "Silly girl,what makes you so certain you're not a Taylor? If you weren't my granddaughter, why would I care for you so deeply?"

The question hung in the air between us. Tears pricked behind mny eyes,but I blinked them back. I needed to stay focused.

"I'm a grown woman now," I said softly. "If I'd never found out, maybe I could have lived my whole life in ignorance. But now that I know,I can't just pretend nothing's changed."

I stared down at my hands, the weight of years finally breaking free."Ever since I was little, I've felt it-how different they treated me compared to Victoria. I kept wondering what I was doing wrong, why I wasn't good enough. So I studied harder, tried to please them more, did everything I could think of.., but nothing ever satisfied them."

My voice wavered but didn't break. "Grandpa, I know you love me. I know you've always treated me like your real granddaughter.But now I understand that I'm not actually a Taylor by blood. I came here today because I need to know-who are my real parents?"

The silence that followed was deafening. Grandpa's lack of denial was confirmation enough.

"Did they... did they not want me?" I asked, the question that had
haunted me since Christmas Eve finally escaping my lips.

"Don't jump to conclusions," Grandpa said firmly, reaching across to take my hand. "They didn't abandon you. They..." He sighed heavily. "They're no longer in this world,Summer. Why obsess over these details? All you need to know is that you're a member of the Taylor family.You're George Taylor's granddaughter. Everything I have is yours. Isn't that enough?”

Before I could respond, the door opened suddenly. Brandon stood in the doorway, his expression serious, bringing with him the chill of the winter air outside. My heart lurched at the sight of him-I hadn't expected him here.


"Brandon!" I exclaimed, genuinely surprised.

"June!" He stepped into the room, then nodded respectfully to Grandpa."Mr.Taylor."


Grandpa visibly relaxed, a relieved smile spreading across his face. "Ah,Brandon! You two planned this meeting together?"

Brandon didn't answer directly. Instead, he sat beside me, draping his winter coat over my shoulders. The weight of it was comforting, the lingering warmth of his body heat enveloping me.

Brandon leaned close to my ear, his voice low enough that only I could hear him. "You'll explain everything to me when we get home."

His tone sent a shiver down my spine-not fear, exactly,but a clear indication he wasn't pleased I'd come alone.

"Darling," Brandon said suddenly, his hand resting on my knee, "could you get us another pot of green tea?"

I recognized the dismissal for what it was-a transparent attempt to speak with Grandpa alone. Though reluctant, I nodded and left the room,closing
the door behind me.

I paused in the hallway. my heart pounding. Part of me wanted to press my eat against the door, to eavesdrop on their conversation. But that was what had started this whole mess in the first place. wasn't ir?
###Chapter 267: Do You Like the Wedding Ring

Summer's POV

I walked in with the fresh tea, catching that look on Brandon's face-whatever he was about to say must have been important.

"Hey Grandpa! Brandon!" I called,setting down the teapot.


I slid into the seat next to Brandon, glancing between them. "What were you guys talking about?"


"What else?" Grandpa George chuckled, obviously dodging the question."Just chatting about you two lovebirds!"

He quickly changed the subject, and no matter how many times I tried to circle back. Grandpa kept swerving away from any real answers.The more he avoided it, the more desperate I became to know about my origins.
Thankfully, Brandon helped smooth over the awkwardness.

During the drive home. Brandon focused on the road while I sat in silence,staring at my hands.


The quiet between us felt loaded with tension. He tarned on some music without saying anything, clearly giving me space.

Finally, I couldn't take it anymore.

"Don't you have anything you want to ask me?"I blurted out.

Brandon kept one hand on the wheel, glancing my way with that impossibly calm expression of his. He reached over and covered my hand with his, giving it a gentle squeeze.

"I toId you. I'll wait until you're ready to talk," he said quietly.

For the first time ever, I pulled my hand away from his. I turned to stare
out the window. gathering my thoughts.

"You already knew. didn't you?" I finally asked.

"Knew what?" Brandon's voice revealed nothing.

"About me. About my relationship with the Taylors." Frustration bubbled up inside me. "God, it feels like you're playing dumb when I'm already feeling so exposed."


"June," Brandon sighed, cutting off my spiraling thoughts. "I've said it before-I don't care what your last name is. I care that you're you. You're my wife. Brandon Stark's wife. That's all that matters."

I whipped around to face him, tears threatening but refusing to fall.

"When did you find out?" I asked, barely above a whisper.

"Not much earlier than you," he replied.

I dropped my head, feeling utterly defeated. "Do you think I'm pathetic?Everything I've busted my ass for turns out to be total bullshit. No wonder they treated me like crap. No wonder they never loved me. I'm not even their kid! God, it all makes sense now."


"June, you have me," Brandon reached for my hand again, his expression seríous. "I've told you-even if everyone else bails on you, I never will."

"Really?" My confidence was shot. "Brandon, do you know how badly I always wanted my mom to just hug me? For my dad to remember my birthday? They forgot every single year. Mly mom never once held me."I counted on my fingers. "They'd only remember after Victoria's birthday had passed. Every year, only Grandpa and Grandfather Thompson celebrated with me."

"Isn't that better?" Brandon said. "It proves they genuinely care about you."
He squeezed my hand. "June. listen-why not just pretend this revelation never happened?"

"Why?" I looked at him in disbelief. "T'm not a Taylor. They only adopted me for some sketchy reason. Who are my real parents? Why did they dump me? If I'd never found out. I could've lived my whole life in the dark. But now I know, how can I just pretend otherwise? I can't do that!"

Sometimes I could be incredibly stubborn. I was the type who wouldn't turn around until I slammed into a wall. "Brandon, I don't want to live a lie anymore. Can't you understand that?"


Brandon's eyes darkened. "But you won't get answers from George."

"Then I'll ask Grandfather Thompson. He must know too. Otherwise,why would he have been so good to me all these years? I heard my mother say she only adopted me because Grandfather would give her something in return. So I must be his granddaughter, right?"

I was getting increasingly worked up. Brandon suddenly pulled over and fixed me with a serious stare that made me nervous. "Brandon, what-"

"If Grandpa George won't tell you, do you really think Professor Thompson will?" Brandon shook his head, "You won't get anything from either of them. Listen to me-let this go for now. Since you're so determined to know, I'll help you find out, but you need to give me time."

"Really?" I asked skeptically. "You'll help me investigate?"

"You're my wife. Your problems are my problems." His voice softened."But you have to promise to stop obsessing over this for now."

I bit my lip. "Fine. I won't bring it up or ask Grandfather. But you have to help me. I need to know the truth, no mnatter what."

"Even if the truth hurts?" Brandon's gaze was intense.
I paused, then nodded firmly. "Even then. I need to know."

Brandon's lips curved upward as he gently stroked my cheek. "Good. Now stop looking so miserable. Smile for me."

I tried to force a smile, but it clearly wasn't convincing.

Brandon shook his head. "While we still have time, let me take you somewhere."


"Where?" I asked,confused.

Brandon's smile reached his eyes this time. "It's a surprise."

He made a quick call as we drove. "Are you at the shop now?"

A woman's surprised voice came through the speaker. "Yes,though I'm closing early. Are you coming by?"

"Yes, bringing someone with me. Everything ready?" Brandon asked.

"Been ready for days. Had a small issue but it's fixed now. When will you arrive?" she asked respectfully.

"Soon," he replied beore hanging up.

When we arrived at an upscale mall,I was confused. "A shopping mall?Seriously?"

Brandon justsmiled as he helped me out. "You'll see."

He took my hand as we headed straight for the jewelry section. My heart skipped. "Are you buying me a New Year's gift?"

A. stylish woman approached us as we reached a boutique. "Mr. Stark!You made it!"

Brandon nodded."Is everything ready?"
"Yes,waiting for you." she replied, her eyes lingering on me before dropping to our intertwined fingers. "This must be Mrs. Stark?"

I looked at Brandon, surprised he hadn't corrected her. "Hello, I'm Summer."


"Hello!" Her face lit up, clearly assessing what kind of woman had captured Brandon Stark.


"My wife.Summer." Brandon confirmed, leading me to the seating area.

"Mrs. Stark, I'm Lisa, the designer here." Her assistant approached with an elegant jewelry box.


"Here's what you requested, Lisa."

"Mr. Stark, here's your order," Lisa said, handing it to Brandon.

"Give me your hand," he instructëd.

Confused. I extended my hand. Brandon opened the box and pulled out a ring, then solemnly slipped it onto my finger.

"Perfect fit," he said, examining my hand with satisfaction before looking up. "Do you like it? Our wedding ring."

Wedding ring?
###Chapter 268: I Love You Brandon

Summer's POV

I stared at the elegant platinum band on my finger, watching how it caught the light. "Wedding ring?" I repeated. my heart suddenly racing.

Brandon nodded, a rare smile playing at his lips. "No one's ever put a ring on your finger before, have they?"


I couldn't stop staring at it-simple but exquisite, with a modest diamond that suited my style perfectly. The kind of ring I would have chosen for myself.

"It's beautiful," I whispered, turning my hand to see it from different angles.


Brandon pinched my nose playfully and handed me a matching box."Help me put mine on."

"You have one too?" I asked in surprise, admiring my ring again before examining the entire set in the box. "When did you start planning this? I had no idea!"


"That's a secret," Brandon replied, taking out the men's ring and placing it in my palm. "Put it on for me."

I held it up, comparing it to the one on my finger. Both rings were elegantly simple without fancy embellishments, though their shape was unique-not the traditional circle I'd expected.

I turned Brandon's ring back and forth, holding it up to the light without actually putting it on his finger. Something inside caught my eye.

"Wait, there's an engraving?" I exclaimed, peering closer.

I quickly pulled off my own ring to check, and sure enough, there was an
engraving inside mine too. My ring had the letters "BS" while his had "SB"-our initials reversed.

"These are our names?" I smiled, understanding dawning. "Is this... your way of marking territory?"


Brandon nodded when he saw mne finally smiling again. "You could say that."


He took my ring and slid it back onto my finger. "Don't take this off casually,understand?"


I giggled and placed his ring on his finger. "Brandon, I really love these rings."

"Good," he said simply. "Lisa's pieces are all one-of-a-kind designs."

"Really?" I glanced toward Lisa, who was watching us from across the room. I suddenly felt self-conscious, realizing we were being so intimate in public. What if someone saw us?

"Don't worry," Brandon assured me, taking my hand in his. "Nobody knows we're here today."

Our hands intertwined, the seemingly plain rings now catching the light brilliantly. My earlier sadness began to fade, replaced by a warm glow of happiness as I stared at our joined hands.

Brandon patted my shoulder. "What about the necklace and bracelet? Do you like those too?"


"I love everything," I replied honestly, smiling gratefully at Lisa. "Lisa,your designs are amazing. I really love them."

"It's my honor to serve you and Mr. Stark," she responded warmly."Especially since Mr. Stark has been my benefactor."
She gestured to her assistant, who brought over another gift box and presented it to Brandon.

"When Mr. Stark came to order wedding rings. I was curious what kind of exceptional woman would be worthy of him," Lisa continued."Now that I've met you. I understand. This is my wedding gift to you both-not expensive,but from the heart."


Brandon nodded slightly, silently directing me to accept it.

I opened the box to find an exquisite brooch. Like our rings, it had a clean design, shaped almost like a phoenix with sparkling diamonds. "This is...this is way too valuable!"


Lisa raised an eyebrow, looking amused as she glanced at Brandon.He took the brooch from my hands. "Thanks," he said simply, then added,"James will send over the payment."

"Perfect," Lisa replied, clearly appreciating Brandon's straightforward manner. "When will you hold your wedding ceremony, Mr. Stark?"

Brandon raised an eyebrow slightly, then looked at me with a hint of a smile. "Not just yet, but IIl let you know when we do."

"TI'll look forward to celebrating your happiness then," she replied.

As we left the jewelry store, I happily held Brandon's hand, practically skipping ahead of him, all my earlier gloom forgotten. "Brandon, where are we going now?"


"It's still early. Let's get dinner and maybe see a movie?" he suggested.watching me with fond amusement.

I smiled but then remembered something troubling, "Wait,weren't you supposed to go back to the Stark mansion today? Sean mentioned your family requires everyone to be present this time of year. After you left
suddenly last time, won't they say something?"

I couldn't help worrying that my selfishness in asking Brandon to come to me on Christmas Eve had created problems. After all, he was the future head of the Stark family-his sudden disappearance must have raised questions.


"Don't worry about that," Brandon replied, taking my hand and guiding me into the car. He fastened my seatbelt carefully. "TI've taken care of that."

"But..." I stared at my ring again. "Are you planning to announce our relationship publicly?"

"Would you prefer I didn't?" he asked.

I shook my head. Before discovering I wasn't really a Taylor,I might have hesitated, but now my perspective had shifted. "I'm your wife, and that can't be changed. I've never wanted to hide from that. But if you're going public, are you prepared for the consequences? What about the Sinclair family?"

"Soon," Brandon assured me. "It'll be over soon." The Sinclairs clearly weren't obstacles in his mind. "Now, let's get dinner, see a movie, then go home for fireworks and the New Year countdown.What do you think?"

"Really?" My eyes lit up with excitement as I grabbed his hand. "You're actually going to stay with me at the Hamptons for New Year's Eve? Is it really okay to skip the Stark mansion event?"

"It doesn't matter," Brandon replied dismissively. It was clearly just a formality to him, one he'd only attended in the past because he had nothing better to do. Now that he had me, he wouldn't abandon me at home alone.

I threw my arms around him and kissed his cheek impulsively. "Brandon.I love you so much!"
"Silly girl," he murmured, smoothing my tousled hair. "This makes you that happy?"

"Of course!" I didn't tell him that New Year's had always been just a formality for me too.


My poor relationship with the Taylors meant they never really wanted me around. If not for Grandpa George's insistence, they probably would have preferred I not come home at all. New Year's had always been both my happiest and most painful time-happy because of the festive atmosphere and Grandpa's kindness, but painful from enduring everyone else's cold treatment.

I'd expected to spend this New Year alone and miserable, so Brandon's offer to stay with me filled me with joy I couldn't contain.

"But I just remembered something," Brandon said suddenly.

"What is it?" I blinked, settling back in my seat.

"We haven't visited your grandfather Thompson yet."

"Oh!" I smacked my forehead, feeling guilty. "You're right! After visiting Grandpa George, I usually spend time with Grandfather Thompson. With everything that's happened, I completely forgot. Do you think he's angry I haven't called?"


"No," Brandon assured me, pinching my nose affectionately. "He won't be upset with you."


"Let's go see him now!" I suggested, already reaching for my phone.
###Chapter 269: Thompson's Wedding Gift

**Brandon's POV**

The moment we pulled up to Professor Thompson's brownstone. I caught Summer stealing a nervous glance at me. her teeth worrying her lower lip.After the drama with the Taylors. I knew she was desperate for some normalcy with the grandfather who'd always shown her unconditional love.

"Ready?" I asked, squeezing her hand.

Summer's smile brightened instantly. "Absolutely."

We exchanged knowing looks as she pressed the doorbell. The door swung open to reveal Professor Thompson, his silver hair slightly disheveled, intelligent eyes immediately locking onto Summer.

"Well, well," he huffed, folding his arms. "Look who finally remembered her old grandfather exists."

"Grandpa! Happy New Year!" Summer exclaimed, bypassing me entirely and launching herself straight into his arms.

I watched as the old man's facade crumbled instanaly. He enveloped her with the tenderness that only true family could express.

"Grandpa, it's been forever! You look as handsome as ever," Summer cooed.beaming up at him.

Thompson rapped his knuckles gently against her forehead. "And you've clearly been having the time of your life at George's place, hmm? Too busy to visit me?"

Summer tucked herself under his arm as they walked inside. "Brandon,bring the stuff in!" she called over her shoulder, every inch the commanding wife.
By the time I'd hauled everything inside, they were already settled in the living room. Summer perched on the arm of Thompson's chair.

"I've been happy," she was saying. "But seeing you makes me even happier!"


Thompson pinched her nose playfully. "Happy enough to forget about your Grandpa for weeks?"


Thompson's gaze shifted to me. "Brandon," he acknowledged with a nod."
I half expected you'd let Summer come alone. Good to see you proved me wrong."


I caught the subtle test in his words. Thompson had never fully approved of our secret marriage, thinking Summer deserved a more public acknowledgment.

Before I could respond, Jenkins, Thompson's longtime butler,entered with a tea service.


"Miss Summer, Mr. Stark, your tea," he announced. "The professor has been beside himself with excitement since he heard you were coming."

"Jenkins!" Thompson protested.

Summer jumped up. "Let me help you with the rest, Jenkins," she offered.following him toward the kitchen.

I watched her disappear down the hallway, my lips curving into an involuntary smile.

"Professor," I acknowledged, turning back to face my former mentor.

Thompson snorted, all pretense of warmth vanishing."My study. Now."He rose and strode out without looking back.
I stood with my back straight, waiting for him to speak first. It was this posture-this refusal to cower-that had first caught his attention when I was his student.

"You know why I've called you in here?" Thompson asked.

"I believe so." I replied evenly.

His eyes narrowed. "I understand your feelings for my granddaughter.
What I don't understand is this secrecy, this hiding."

"Professor," I met his gaze directly, "I assume you've heard about recent events between Summer and myself?"

"I hear many things," he replied cryptically.

"Then let me be clear," I said. "My intentions toward Summer have always been genuine. I intend to spend my life with her."

Thompson's expression remained impassive,but I caught the slight twitch at the corner of his mouth-a tell I'd learned to recognize years ago.

"Shall we?" I gestured toward the chess set.

Thompson moved toward the board, automatically reaching for the white pieces.

As we began setting up, I made my move. "That day Summer went to the Taylor household for Christmas, something happened. I wonder if you might know anything about it?"

His hand trembled as he positioned a pawn. His eyes lifted to mine.suddenly wary.

"Summer is your biological granddaughter," I stated plainly."That fact is immutable,isn't it?"
Thompson sighed heavily. "Sometimes I wonder if taking you as my student was wisdom or folly." he muttered. abandoning his chess piece to retreat to his desk.

"You have your burdens, Professor," I observed quietly.

"You've always been too perceptive," he replied, his voice suddenly tired."Yes, there are things you're figuring out. Things I can't discuss-not even with you."

"Is keeping Summer in the dark truly what's best for her?" I challenged.

Thompson's fist came down on the desk. "Best or not,it's how things must remain!" His voice softened. "Tell her to stop digging. What she might find won't bring her peace."

A soft knockinterrupted us. Summer peered into the room, still wearing Jenkins's apron.

"Grandpa? Brandon? What are you two talkingabout?" Her eyes darted between us, sensing the tension.

"Nothing much," I answered smoothly. "Just enjoying a game with the Professor."

"Dinner's almost ready," she announced before leaving to help Jenkins.

After she'd gone, Thompson turned to me with a pleading expression. "Summer is a simple girl at heart. Not in intelligence, but in what she needs.Treat her well, and she'll give you a lifetime of loyalty."

He leaned forward. "Brandon, let this matter rest. For everyone's sake, but especially for hers."

I nodded silently, my mind cataloging what he hadn't said.
Dinner with Professor Thompson was vastly different than at the Taylor mansion. Summer seemed to bloom in the warm atmosphere, laughing and sharing stories.

I caught Jenkins's subtle nod toward our hands, directing Thompson's attention to our matching rings. The professor's eyes widened before his demeanor brightened. He reached over, spooning extra meat onto my plate.

"Brandon," Thompson began casually, "about your marriage to Summer-"

"Grandpa!" Summer cut in, her cheeks flushing. "Why bring that up during dinner?" Despite her protest, I noticed her expectant glance my way.

"Once things settle down," I said, meeting Thompson's gaze,"I intend to make our marriage public. Summer deserves nothing less."

"Good!" Thompson declared with satisfaction.

Under the table, I slid my hand onto Summer's thigh, earning an immediate swat.

"Behave yourself," she hissed.

"You seem happy," I observed.

"I don't know what you're talking about," she sniffed in mock defiance.

"I can see it," I replied softly, reaching for her hand. "Not just with my eyes,but with my heart."

She yanked it away, aware of our audience. "Eat your dinner," she commanded.




Later, as evening deepened, Summer reluctantly suggested it was time to head home.
"Will you be going to the Stark residence tonight?" Thompson asked me pointedly.

"No." I replied firmly. "Summer and I will be returning to our home. It's our first New Year's Eve as a married couple."

Thompson signaled to Jenkins, who brought forward two elegantly wrapped boxes. "These are for you two. A wedding gift."

Summer accepted them with sincere thanks, naturally slipping her arm through mine. "Thank you, Grandpa."

The moment we were in the car, Summer tore into her gift box with childlike enthusiasm. Inside lay a small, ornate silver lock with intricate engravings.

Curious, I opened my own box to find... a single sheet of blank paper.

Summer stared between the two gifts, confusion written across her face."
What does this mean?" she asked, turning the lock over in her palm.
###Chapter 270: New Year's Eve

Brandon's POV

"What's this about, Grandpa? When did you start getting into this kind of thing?" Summer asked, turning the ornate silver lock over in her palm.Her confusion mirrored my own as I stared at the blank sheet of paper in my box.

"Come on." I said. I tucked the boxes into my jacket pocket. "Let's go home. I'm sure the professor has his reasons."

As we drove back toward the Hamptons, I glanced over at Summer, who'd fallen uncharacteristically quiet. Her fingers traced the edge of Thompson's envelope, her eyes distant and unfocused. Whatever was running through that beautiful mind of hers had completely captured her attention.

"What are you thinking about?" I asked, but she didn't respond, lost in her thoughts.

By the time we pulled into the driveway of our estate, she still hadn't snapped out of her daze. I parked the car and reached over, gently touching her forehead to break her trance.

"Hey.Where'd you go?"

Her eyes refocused, widening suddenly as she jolted back to reality."Oh!Weren't we supposed to get fireworks for tonight? We haven't bought anything for New Year's!"

"Get out of the car," I said simply, nodding toward her door.

Summer's confusion turned to shock as she stepped out and saw the mountain of fireworks boxes stacked neatly by our front entrance. Her jaw dropped comically.
"What the-how did these -" she stammered.

James appeared from beside the house, perfectly composed despite the late hour and holiday. "Mr. Stark, Mrs. Stark," he greeted us with a slight bow.
"Everything has been arranged according to your specifications,sir."

I nodded, satisfied with his efficiency. "Good work." I pulled out my car keys and tossed them to him. "Happy New Year, James."

His eyes widened as he caught the keys, his usual stoic demeanor momentarily cracking. "Thank you, Mr. Stark! Thank you, Mrs.Stark!"

Summer blinked in confusion. "Me? What are you thanking me for?"

I cut in before James could respond. "Take the next three days off,James."

"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir." He nodded respectfully before heading toward my Range Rover, his steps noticeably lighter.

Summer watched him go, her brow furrowed. "Why was he so excited about keys?"


Inside. I'd already slipped off my shoes and was holding out her house slippers when she finally stepped through the door,still distracted.

"What's on your mind? You've been somewhere else all evening," I said,offering her the slippers.

She blinked, focusing on me. "Nothing. Just... why did you make James work on New Year's? And why did he look so happy about it?"

"A Range Rover," I replied simply.′′Put these on."

Her eyes widened as understanding dawned. "Wait, is that why he was so excited about the keys? You *gave* him your car?"

"Mm-hmm." I guided her into our warm living room, where the television
was already on, playing the New Year's Eve coverage from Times Square.

Summer immediately kicked off her slippers and curled up on the sofa.patting the space beside her. I settled next to her, pulling her against my chest as she nestled into me, her body fitting perfectly against mine.

"James has been with me for years," I said, absently stroking her hair."If you ever need anything when I'm not around, go to him directly."

She tilted her head up to look at me, her eyes soft. "Brandon."

"Hmm? What is it?"


"I love you," she said simply, her voice quiet but certain.

I raised an eyebrow, amused by her sudden declaration. "Saying you love me out of nowhere? What do you want?"

"Nothing!" she protested, her cheeks flushing adorably. "I just realized how much more I love you now."

"Is that so?" I leaned closer, my voice dropping. "Well, it just so happens I love you more too."

I felt her heart rate accelerate against my chest, her skin warming under my touch. She pulled back suddenly,her face scarlet.

"God, you're embarrassing!" she said, scooting to what she apparently considered a "safe distance" and covering her face with her hands. "No,I mean-I just want to watch TV!"

I couldn't help the smile that tugged at my lips as I watched her flustered reaction. Even after all this time, I could still make her blush like a schoolgirl.

My phone interrupted the moment, buzzing insistently in my pocket. I checked the screen-Sarah. With a sigh, I answered.
"Brandon, where are you?" My sister's voice was tense. "Grandfather and Father are waiting for you at home."

"Go ahead without me," I replied coolly. "Don't wait."

"That's not acceptable!" She sounded genuinely distressed. "Brandon, you've never missed the family gathering. What's going on? Is something wrong?"


"Nothing's wrong." I cut her off. "Just tell Grandfather and Father I won't be coming today."

"Brandon!" Sarah's voice rose. "You've been there every year. If you don't show up, it'll cause chaos in the family. Tell me why you-"

"The Stark family won't collapse without me for one night," I said firmly."They have plenty of people there. A gathering like that-I'm not missing much. Look, I have to go."

I hung up and tossed the phone aside, pinching the bridge of my nose to stave off the headache I could feel building. A moment later, Summer appeared with a steaming cup of tea, her face etched with concern.

"What's wrong?" she asked gently.

"Nothing. Just some work matters," I lied, not wanting to burden her.

She saw right through me. "Brandon, don't lie to me. That was the Stark mansion calling, wasn't it? You don't have to stay with me-you should go.
11


"I promised I'd be with you," I said, taking the tea from her hands.

"But your family-"

"No one is more important than you," I cut her off, powering down my phone and tossing it aside. "June, no one matters more than you. Family
gatherings happen every year." I looked up at her, deliberately changing the subject. "Want to set off some fireworks now?"

"Wait. let me change first," she said, heading for the stairs. "It's cold outside."


I watched her disappear upstairs, returning moments later in a light purple sweater, carrying a heavy coat for me. She'd bundled herself up like a porcelain doll, with a scarf, hat, and gloves. I couldn't help the surge of tenderness that washed over me at the sight.

"So where are we doing this?" she asked excitedly. "The yard or the roof?What do you think it's like watching fireworks from the rooftop?"

"Want to find out?" I asked, lifting two boxes of fireworks. "Let's go up and see. We can come back for the rest later."

As we headed toward the stairs, Summer pulled out her phone and started recording."Brandon, say hi to the camera! Come on, wave or something!"

She was walking backward up the stairs, so focused on filming that she missed a step. I dropped the boxes and lunged forward, catching her before she could fall.

"Careful!" I scolded, my heart racing at how close she'd come to tumbling down the stairs. "I swear I need to tie a rope around you and attach it to my belt.Maybe then you'd stop bouncing around like this."

She just laughed, completely unfazed by her near-accident, and skipped ahead of me up the stairs to the glass-enclosed rooftop.

I shook my head, gathering up the fireworks boxes. This woman would be the death of me-and yet I couldn't imagine spending New Year's Eve any other way.
###Chapter 271: Drugs and Schemes

**Brandon's POV**

I was just drifting off. Summer nestled comfortably against my chest, when my phone vibrated on the nightstand. Careful not to disturb her, I reached over and checked the screen. Sean. At this hour, it couldn't be good news.

"Elle Sinclair had an episode!" His voice came through immediately,dispensing with any greeting.

My eyes snapped fully open, a cold clarity washing over me. I gently disentangled myself from Summer's sleeping form, tucking the covers around her before silently slipping out of bed. She stirred slightly but didn't wake as I quietly made my way to my study down the hall.

"How do you know?" I asked, closing the door behind me.

"How do I know?" Sean's voice dripped with sarcasm. "Oh, I don't know,maybe because she's currently in my hospital after needing two sedatives to calm her down." Hepaused. "What the hell did you do today?"

I sat down at my desk, my lips curving into a cold smile. "Nothing that concerns you."

"Nothing that concerns me?" Sean laughed humorlessly. "You're one cold-blooded bastard, you know that? Going after a woman like that."

"How long have you known me?" I countered. "Is this really surprising to you?"

Sean sighed heavily."Fair point. So what's the next step in your master plan? Because I'm assuming there is one."

"What's her current status?"

"T've already left the hospital, but she's sedated and under observation. Oh.
and your parents are there too. Both injured."

That caught my attention, "Elaborate."

"Robert has a fractured arm, and Jane hassome nasty cuts and bruises.Apparently, Elle went absolutely ballistic in the Stark mansion. Threw a crystal vase at Janhe before attacking Robert. Took three security guards to subdue her."


I leaned back in my chair, contemplating this unexpected development."
Interesting."

"You know," Sean continued, his voice lowering, "I've never liked Jane Sinclair.Woman's got nothing between her ears except schemes and bitterness."


"Your point?"

"Just thinking about how Alice got screwed over because of her." Sean's voice hardened. "Your half-sister deserved better than being kept out of the Stark family because of that woman's machinations."

I remained silent, knowing where this was heading.

"Remember when Jane drugged your father and that college student, just to create grounds for divorce?" Sean continued, anger evident in his tone."The poor girl ends up pregnant with Alice, but Jane still doesn't get her divorce. Instead, the Sinclairs use their influence to destroy the girl's life,and Alice becomes collateral damage-forever barred from the Stark family registry. And for what? So Jane could save face?"

"I don't need the history lesson,"' I cut in sharply. "If you're angry, don't direct it at me."

Sean suddenly laughed, the sound jarring against the tension."So,are you going to visit your injured parents? Make a statement while they're
vulnerable?"

"Not yet," I replied coldly. "The timing isn't right."

"Of course not," Sean mocked. "The great Brandon Stark always waits for the perfect moment."


"Tm going back to bed." I stated flatly.

"Wait-"

I ended the call mid-protest, silencing Sean's voice.




Several days later, I was reviewing acquisition documents in my study when Sean appeared unannounced at my Hamptons estate.

"What are you doing here?" I asked without looking up from my paperwork. "Shouldn't you be enjoying your time off elsewhere?"

Sean flopped onto my leather sofa, completely at ease. "Is that any way to greet the friend who's been covering your ass? Talk about burning bridges after crossing the river."

I finally glanced up, irritation creeping into my voice. "WNhat do you want?"

"Just curious-how much of that special formula did you give Elle?"he asked casually, examining his fingernails. "Because based on her reaction, I'd say it was a pretty significant dose."

I set down my pen. "You know exactly what was in those pills. You're the one who created the compound,"

"A compound that causes mental confusion and emotional instability rather than treating actual symptoms," Sean reminded me with a pointed look. "I risked my medical license for that, you know."
"I seem to recall you giving her vitamins," I countered dryly.

"Vitamins with a little something extra," he smirked. "Look, I'm not judging. I just want to know what we're dealing with here."


"We're notdealing with anything. You've done your part." I gestured toward the door. "If that's all. I have work to finish."

Sean peered over at the documents spread across my desk. "Sinclair Group acquisition plans?" He whistled low. "You're not wasting any time,are you?



Before I could respond, the sound of heels clicking on hardwood floors caught our attention. Summer appeared at the doorway, dressed in a light gray coat, her hair perfectly styled, and makeup expertly applied.

"Going somewhere?" Sean asked, flashing her a charming smile.

Summer nodded, her face brightening. "It's the holidays, and the city's so lively right now: I'm meeting Ruby and Scarlett for lunch."

Her eyes landed on the papers scattered across my desk. "Are you working through the break? You should really take some time off, Brandon."

I rose from my chair, walking over to her. "Just tying up some loose ends,"I assured her, my voice softening as I gently traced her cheekbone with my thumb. "Head out early to beat the traffic. And be careful-the streets will be crowded."

"I will," she promised, leaning slightly into my touch.

"Text me when you arrive," I added, adjusting her scarf.

She nodded, then turned to Sean with a polite smile. "It was nice seeing you,Dr.Sean."

After Summer left. Sean shot me a bemused look. "I don't think T'll ever
get used to seeing you like that-all soft and domesticated. It's like watching a wolf turn into a lapdog."

"I don't recall inviting you to observe my personal life," I remarked coldly.

"Come on," Sean cajoled, "since Summer's out, why don't we go out too?Ethan's still in town. you know."

That caught my attention. "Kennedy? I thought he'd gone back to Philadelphia by now."


"Nope,still here." Sean grinned. "You've been so caught up with your wife you've forgotten all about your brothers. How about we hit up Manhattan Club? For old times sake."


I considered the offer, realizing it had been months since I'd spent tíme with the others. Ever since Grace's incident three years ago and Alice's subsequent departure, our brotherhood had gradually drifted apart.

"Fine," I conceded, setting aside my work. "Call Ethan and Edward.Tell them to meet us there at eight."

Sean was already texting as we headed toward the door. "Should we have Ethan bring little firecracker Arya along? That Carter girl's a riot."

"Arya Carter?" I repeated, something tugging at the edges of my memory.

"Yeah,you know-Carter family kid they never officially claimed? She calls Meave 'aunt' but follows Ethan around like a shadow." Sean shook his head. "Never understood why the Carters didn't just bring her home properly instead of leaving her with Ethan."

My mind suddenly flashed to a half-forgotten memory-a small girl with fierce eyes and a determined set to her jaw. Something about her had always seemed...familiar.
"Hey," Sean interrupted my thoughts, "why the sudden death stare? Did I say something wrong?"


I smoothed my expression, pushing the unsettling thought aside. "It's nothing. Let's go."
###Chapter 272: Brothers' Gathering

Brandon's POV

The familiar opulence of Manhattan Club's private room felt like stepping back in time. Dim lighting, leather chairs worn to perfection, and the lingering scent of expensive cigars-a sanctuary where Wall Street's elite came to escape the world.


Sean was already shuffling a deck of cards when I arrived, his smirk widening at the sight of me.


"Look who decided to grace us with his presence!" he announced to our small gathering. "The elusive Brandon Stark, finally emerging from his love nest."

Ethan Kennedy looked up from his whiskey, his angular features illuminated by the amber glow of the table lamp. The silent figure beside him-Arya Carter-remained perfectly still, almost statue-like in her careful composure.

"Brandon," Ethan acknowledged with a slight nod. His eyes held their usual calculating gleam, neither warm nor cold.

Edward Lee sat opposite him, looking more haggard than I remembered.Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and his once-pristine appearance had given way to a slightly rumpled suit and loosened tie.

"Gentlemen," I greeted, taking my seat at the table. I glanced toward Arya,adding,"And lady."

She barely looked up, her gaze fixed on her hands.

"I thought you'd be back in Philadelphia by now," I said to Ethan,accepting the drink Sean pushed toward me. "Any progress with finding Meave?"
Something flashed in Ethan's eyes-a warning, perhaps. "What's that supposed to mean? Am I cramping your style by staying in New York?"

I shrugged, deliberately casual. "Just curious." I turned my attention to Arya. "And Miss Carter, you're not heading back to the Carter estate for the holidays?"


Arya looked up, startled. Her eyes met mine for a brief moment before darting away. Unlike Ethan's calculated coldness, her gaze held something more complex-uncertainty,perhaps, or fear.

"I haven't been formally recognized by the Carter family yet," she replied softly. "Aunt Meave is the only Carter I've really known."

"That doesn't sound like you, Ethan," I observed, watching him carefully."Taking twenty years to reintroduce a lost Carter to her family? You're usually more... efficient."

Ethan's hand twitched ever so slightly as he reached for his cards. "It's not the right time yet."

"Seems like you've got a lot of free time on your hands lately, Brandon."Ethan countered,eyes narrowing. "Got your own affairs sorted?"

"I was just going to ask about Meave's-"

"I know what I'm doing," Ethan cut me off sharply. He turned to Arya,his voice softening."Bored?"

She shook her head. "I'm fine. I wouldn't know where else to go anyway."

"It's the holidays," Ethan suggested, his tone carefully casual. "You should meet Brandon's wife, You two could keep each other company when you're bored."

Sean snorted. dealing the cards with practiced efficiency,"Funny you
should mention that. The only reason our dear Brandon is here tonight is because his wife left him all alone."

"She didn't leave me," I corrected, examining my cards. "Summer's just out with her friends. She has a life outside of me."


"Oh?" Sean raised an eyebrow. "So it's not that she temporarily abandoned you,and you suddenly remembered your old friends exist?"


"Summer was meeting Ruby and Scarlett today," I explained, arranging my hand. "She deserves time with her friends. I'm not about to follow her around like a lost puppy."

"What about you, Edward?" Sean asked, turning to the silent figure across the table. "You're awfully quiet tonight."

Edward's lips thinned into a tight line. "Should I be chattering nonstop like you?"

The game progressed in tense silence for several hands, broken only by occasional comments about the cards. I won three consecutive rounds,much to Sean's obvious irritation.

"Would it kill you to let someone else win occasionally?" Sean grumbled as I collected another pot. "Jesus, Brandon, is this because your wife ditched you? Taking out your frustrations on us?"

"Keep talking," I replied smoothly, "and I'll give you something to really complain about,"

Edward stared at his cards, then at me. "Are you targeting me specifically tonight,Brandon?"

I smiled coldly. "Just good luck. When fortune smiles on you, there's no stopping it." I glanced around the table. "Maybe it's because you're all single. The universe rewards married men."
Sean threw down his cards in disgust. "Fuck off with that smug married bullshit."


Edward abruptly stood, his chair scraping against the hardwood floor. "I need a smoke. Deal me out for this round."


As he strode toward the door. Ethan watched him go with a contemplative expression. "Edward's had a rough few years."


Once the door closed behind Edward, Ethan turned to me,his voice dropping. "You're still refusing to tell him where Grace is, aren't you?"

I kept my expression neutral, gathering the cards. "What makes you think I know?"


"Don't insult my intelligence," Ethan replied. "Someone deliberately covered Grace's tracks, and there's only one person with both the resources and the motivation to do that."

"And what exactly would I gain from keeping them apart?" I challenged.

"Three years is punishment enough," Ethan said, swirling the amber liquid in his glass. "Let Grace come home. Gavin and Meave have been searching for their daughter for years. She shouldn't be kept from her family."

"Believe it or not," I said quietly, "I had nothing to do with Grace's disappearance."

Memories surfaced-Grace with her sharp tongue and sharper mind. We'd never been elose; her arrogance had always rubbed me the wrong way.I'd helped her occasionally, but there'd been no real bond between us.

"If not you," Ethan pressed, "then who?"

The door opened as Edward returned, the smell of cigarettes clinging to his clothes. "Is that true? It wasn't you?" His voice was strained,hovering
between hope and disbelief.

"Lee Enterprises is under attack," Edward continued without waiting for my response. "He's coming back, Brandon."

A cold feeling settled in my gut. "Who's coming back?"

"My uncle." Edward's voice was flat. "I think Grace's disappearance might be connected to him."


"Your uncle?" I frowned, piecing together information I'd gathered over the years. "Theone who was supposed to inherit Lee Enterprises?"

Edward nodded. "Grandfather wanted him to take over, but he left and never returned. Until now, apparently."

The implications hung heavy in the air. Saul Pena's return could destabilize more than just the Lee family's business interests.

"You think he might target Grace to get to you?" I asked carefully.

"I need her back, Brandon," Edward said, desperation creeping into his voice. "If you know anything-anything at all-tell me now."

I weighed my options, considering the consequences. "The Stark family is in a precarious position right now. Grace's return could complicate things further." I met Edward's gaze directly. "And bringing her back isn't as simple as making a phone call."

"Do you even want her to come back?" I asked, watching his reaction closely.

His eyes hardened with determination. "More than anything."

I nodded slowly, decision made. "Then T'll see what I can do."
###Chapter 273: A Small World

**Summer's POV**

"You guys, I swear my mom is going through menopause or something,"Ruby groaned, stabbing at her salad with unnecessary force. "This is a legitimate career, okay? But you know what she said? She said reporting doesn't pay enough and it's too dangerous-that it's a job for men.Seriously? It's 21st century, for God's sake! Are women still not allowed to be journalists?"


I exchanged a knowing glance with Scarlett across the table. Ruby had been ranting about her mother's disapproval since we sat down for lunch.

"What?" Ruby caught our silent exchange, her fork pausing midway to her mouth. "Why are you two looking at each other like that?"

"I was thinking we could do some shopping after lunch. What do you say?"I said quickly, taking a sip of my sparkling water.

Ruby narrowed her eyes, clearly suspicious of my abrupt change of subject,but Scarlett jumped in to help.

"Great idea!" Scarlett said brightly. "Ruby, no offense, but Summer and I both agree that your outfit today is... well, a bit underwhelming."

Ruby looked down at her ensemble-practical khaki pants, a black turtleneck, and a worn leather jacket that had seen better days. Her short.efficient haircut completed the look of someone who prioritized function over fashion. "What's wrong with my clothes? I think I look fine."

"Fine for covering a war zone," I teased. "But we're in Manhattan, not Mogadishu."

"Whatever," Ruby rolled her eyes, though I could see the hint of a smile tugging at her lips. "Not everyone needs to dress like they're waiting for
the paparazzi."

"It's your birthday next month," I reminded her. "Early present from us.No arguments."


Ruby sighed dramatically but didn't protest further. Instead,she leaned forward, her reporter instincts kicking in. "Speaking of paparazzi, what's this I hear about your husband and Victoria? I just got back and people are already gossiping about it. Are those people blind? Like, does Brandon really seem like the type who'd go for someone like Victoria?"

My stomach tightened automatically at the mention of the rumors,but I kept my expression neutral. "That's old news, Ruby. You're really behind.It's basically resolved now."

"Seriously?" Ruby's eyebrows shot up. "Just like that?"

"Just likethat," I confirmed, signaling for the check. "Brandon handled it."

"But still, that's your sister hooking up with your ex, and now she's trying to get with your current-"

"We shouldl get going if we want to beat the crowds," Scarlett cut in smoothly, placing a hand on Ruby's arm. "The sales won't wait for us."




Half an hour later, we were strolling through the Dianaflagship store.The place was crowded with post-holiday shoppers, but not uncomfortably so.

"Holy shit!" Ruby whispered as we walked past racks of clothing with price tags that would make most people faint. "Are you seriously buying me something from here? This is Brandon's brand, right? You're such a boss lady now,"

I smiled, not bothering to correct her assumption about my official
connection to Diana. Technically I wasn't the boss lady yet-at least not publicly-since nobody knew about my marriage to Brandon.

A saleswoman spotted us immediately, her eyes lighting up when she noticed I was wearing one of their new collection pieces. She swept over,perfect smile in place.


"Welcome to Diana! How may I assist you ladies today?" she practically sang.eyes darting between us but lingering appreciatively on my outfit.

Ruby stiffened beside me. "WNe're just browsing,thanks."

Once we were out of earshot, she leaned close to me. "Look, these clothes are gorgeous, but not really my style. Can we maybe check out something more...me?"


The saleswoman caught her words and discreetly moved to help other customers. I sighed. "Ruby, how are we supposed to shop if you keep scaring off the help?"

Ruby just shrugged, unapologetic. "I don't need someone hovering while I-"Her expression suddenly darkened. "Oh, crap."

"What?" I turned to follow her gaze, and my heart sånk. "You've got to be kidding me."

Victoria had just walked in, surrounded by a group of older women.Alexander's mother Nancy was with her, along with what looked like four or five of their friends. Sophie, Victoria's assistant, trailed behind them carrying several shopping bags already. Victoria was playing the perfect daughter-in-law, all smiles and attentiveness, though I could tell from twenty feet away it was all for show.

"Let's get out of here," Ruby muttered, already turning toward the exit.

Too late. Victoria had spotted us.
I watched as her eyes widened in recognition, followed by a calculated smile spreading across her face. She leaned over to whisper something to Nancy,whose expression shifted from relaxed to slightly uncomfortable as she glanced our way.


I knew that look. Nancy had always been kind to me when Alexander and I were together. She'd baked me cookies when I visited. But after Alexander left me for Victoria, she'd grown distant, clearly influenced by her husband's preference for the new match.

Victoria gracefully detached herself from the group and headed straight for us,dragging Nancy along beside her.

"Nancy, look! It's my sister Summer. You remember her, don't you?"Victoria's voice was syrupy sweet, loud enough for everyone nearby to hear.

Nancy looked distinctly uncomfortable. "Of course, your sister. We've met before."

Victoria beamed at me, though her eyes remained cold. "Summer! What a coincidence. Are you shopping too?"

"Clearly," I replied evenly. "Are you out with your mother-in-law?"

"Yes! Nancy and her friends were feeling cooped up at home,so I offered to take them shopping." Victoria gestured grandly toward the women who were now browsing through racks of designer clothing. "I just told them T m treating them all to outfits. Isn't that fun? Since you're here, why don't you join us? It's been forever since we've shopped together as sisters. If you see something you like, just tell me-it'll be my treat."

I nearly laughed out loud at her transparent attempt to flaunt her new status. This was classic Victoria-making sure I knew she had married into money, the very family that was supposed to have been mine. She clearly thought this would hurt me, that I'd be jealous of her success in
snagging my ex-fiancé.

But the truth was. I couldn't care less. Alexander wasn't mine anymore.andI honestly, I wasn't sure he ever truly had been. What Victoria didn't understand was that when something isn't truly yours, you don't miss it when it's gone.

"That sounds great," I replied with a smile that seemed to catch Victoria off guard. She had clearly been expecting resistance or discomfort.

I gestured toward Ruby and Scarlett. "But since my friends are with me.wouldn't it be fair to include them in your generosity too?"
###Chapter 274: The War Between Women

**Summer's POV**

Victoria's smile faltered slightly as I suggested including my friends in her generous offer. I could practically see the calculations running behind her eyes as she tried to figure out how to backpedal without looking bad.

Ruby stepped forward, her face a picture of innocent excitement. "Yeah,Victoria! We're all here together!" She gestured between herself and Scarlett with exaggerated enthusiasm.


Scarlett, picking up the game instantly, clasped her hands together."Victoria, that's so generous of you! Thank you so much!"

Victoria's face tightened almost imperceptibly before relaxing into a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "Of course! Any friends of Summer's are friends of mine."

She turned to Ruby, her gaze sliding over Ruby's practical outfit with barely disguised disdain. "Ruby, I see you haven't changed much over the years. Your style is so:.. unique!"

The condescension in her voice was unmistakable, but Ruby just grinned.completely unperturbed. "Exactly! That's why I need the great Victoria Taylor to rescue my wardrobe!" She spread her arms wide. "Work your magic, fashion guru!"

I bit the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing as Victoria's eye twitched. She clearly hadn't expected Ruby to roll with the insult so easily.For someone who made her living manipulating emotions on camera,Victoria was surprisingly easy to read when thrown off-script.

Nancy Stark stepped forward, her designer handbag swinging from the crook of her arm. "Well, since Victoria has offered, please go ahead and choose something you like." Her voice carried that particular upper-class
tone that managed to sound both polite and dismissive at once. "After all,as the face of Diana, these clothes are practically nothing to us."

Victoria preened at Nancy's words, shooting me a smug look. I wanted to roll my eyes but kept my expression pleasantly neutral.

A saleswoman appeared at Victoria's elbow, practically vibrating with excitement. "Ms. Taylor! What an honor to have you in our store today.Have you found anything you'd like to try on? I'd be happy to bring it to the VIP fitting room for you!"

"I'd like to see the newest collection first," Victoria replied, clearly enjoying the attention.

"Of course, Ms. Taylor! The latest pieces are right this way." The saleswoman gestured toward a separate area of the store, completely ignoring me, Ruby, and Scarlett as if we were invisible.

Victoria shot me a triumphant glance over her shoulder. "Summer,don't just stand there! Come sit down, or maybe you'd like to browse? See anything you like? Feel free to try something on!"

Her voice dripped with false generosity, the subtext clear: Look at me, the celebrity, the important one who belongs here.

"Sure!" I replied with a bright smile, refusing to give her the satisfaction of seeing me annoyed.

I turned to Ruby and Scarlett, gesturing toward the opposite side of the store. "Let's check out those pieces over there."

Once we were safely out of earshot, Ruby exploded in a furious whisper.

"What the actual fuck, Summer? Who does she think she is?" She glared across the store at Victoria, who was holding court amidst the salespeople."She's just a freaking spokesperson for Diana! You're literally married to the
owner of the damn brand!"

I grabbed Ruby's arm before she could say anything else. "Ruby, keep it down!"

"Why did you pull me away?" Ruby demanded, still fuming. "Did you see her acting like she owns the place? Like she's the goddamn boss lady of Diana? And what's with her offering to give clothes to all those stuffy women? Does she think the store just hands her free stuff whenever she wants?"


I couldn't help but smile at Ruby's indignation on my behalf. "Don't worry.She can't actually give them anything."

"What do you mean?" Ruby asked, momentarily distracted from her rant.

"Let's just focus on finding you something nice," I replied,turning to a rack of beautifully tailored blazers. "How about this?" I held up a deep burgundy piece with subtle gold hardware.

"Scarlett, what do you think? Would this look good on Ruby?" I asked,holding the blazer up against Ruby's frame.

Scarlett tilted her head, assessing. "It's perfect. It's still got that edgy vibe Ruby loves, but with a touch of sophistication. What do you think,Ruby?"

Ruby looked skeptical. "How is this anything like what I usually wear?Diana is all about that polished Upper East Side look. I'm more..."

"Just try it on," I insisted, already searching for the right size.

Despite her protests, I could see Ruby's eyes lingering on the blazer,her fingers cautiously feeling the quality of the fabric.

After gathering a few more pieces, I approached a different saleswoman."Excuse me,could we get these items in a fitting room,please?"
The woman glanced at the clothes in my arms, then back at me, her expression cooling. "I'm sorry, those particular pieces aren't for sale."

I blinked, taken aback. "Excuse me?"

"They're not for sale," she repeated, more firmly this time.

"Why not?" I asked,genuinely confused.

The saleswoman's lips thinned with impatience. "They're just not. Why do you have so many questions?"

I raised an eyebrow. "Is this really how Diana treats its customers?"

Before the saleswoman could respond, Victoria materialized beside us,eyeing the burgundy blazer in my hands.

"Summer! What have you found? Let me see," she cooed,reaching for the clothes.


Her eyes widened slightly as she examined the blazer. "Oh,Summer,I'm so sorry. I've already reserved this exact piece. I'm planning to give it to-"

"Wait a second," Ruby cut in, her reporter instincts flaring. "That sales lady just told us these weren't for sale. But you're saying you've reserved it?" She turned to Victoria with mock innocence. "I thought you were going to treat us to anything we wanted? Or was that offer not actually real?"
###Chapter 275: I Can Afford This

**Summer's POV**

Victoria's smile tightened. "I-I didn't say I wouldn't treat you! There are plenty of other beautiful pieces here. Why don't you choose something else?



"But I love this one," Ruby insisted,reaching for the blazer.

Victoria clutched it closer to her chest. "Look, I'm the one giving the gift,so shouldn't I have some say? I really can't let you have this particular one!"1


The commotion had drawn Nancy and her friends, who clustered around Victoria like a shield of designer perfume and judgment.

"Really, Summer," Nancy said with a tight smile, "you should teach your friends some mannes. Victoria is being incredibly generous, and they're behaving like entitled children."

One of Nancy's friends, a woman with an aggressively blond bob and surgical enhancements that defied gravity, sniffed audibly. "What can you expect from someone dressed like... that?" She shot a pointed look at Ruby's practical attire.


"Some people simply don't know how to conduct themselves in establishments like Diana," another woman added, her voice dripping with disdain.

I felt my cheeks burn with anger at the way they were speaking about my friend. Ruby might be blunt and unconventional, but she was loyal, brave,and honest-qualities these women wouldn't recognize if they slapped them in their Botoxed faces.

Ruby, Scarlett and I exchanged glances, and then Ruby burst out laughing.
"Oh my God, this is hilarious! I can't afford it? Seriously?" She gestured toward Victoria. "I thought your sister was the brand ambassador who could just take whatever clothes she wanted and give them away? Isn't that what she implied?"


"Um, excuse me, ladies," one of the saleswomen interrupted, clearly uncomfortable. "While Ms. Taylor is our brand ambassador,we don't actually have a policy allowing our spokespersons to take multiple items to give away as gifts. That's not standard practice."

An awkward silence fell over the group. Victoria's face flushed with embarrassment.

Sophie, ever the loyal assistant, jumped in. "But doesn't Ms. Taylor get to select one piece from any of your stores?"

"Yes, she does," the saleswoman confirmed, "but that's strictly for Ms.Taylor's personal use only. She can select items as our brand ambassador,but they're meant for her to wear, not to distribute."

Victoria looked utterly mortified, and I had to admit, I was enjoying every second of it.

Ruby's face lit up with understanding. "Oh. I see how it works now! Well,Victoria, looks like you'll be spending quite a bit of your own money today!There are what, ten people here? One or two outfits each... that's going to add up!"

She turned back to the saleswoman with newfound enthusiasm. "Hey, you're really pretty! Can I get this blazer in my size? I'm a small. I'll take it!"

Victoria immediately stepped between them. "But I saw it first."

"Did you pay for it yet?" Ruby shot back with a sweet smile. She turned back to the catalog, pointing at several other items. "I'll take these too. I'm feeling generous today. Nothing like spending money during the holidays
to spread some joy!"

Victoria's expression darkened further as she realized Ruby was deliberately selecting items that Nancy's friends had been eyeing.

The saleswoman, thrilled at the prospect of a major sale, nodded eagerly."T'll package these right away. All size small?"

Ruby grinned, giving Victoria's entourage a once-over. "Of course! The three of us have pretty amazing figures-small is perfect. Ladies," she added, addressing Nancy and her friends, "don't worry, we won't be getting the same sizes as you. Though I must say, these styles are quite youthful-you all must have such young spirits!"

Scarlett snorted with laughter, which I quickly silenced with a warning touch on her arm, though I couldn't help the smile tugging at my lips.

The saleswoman quickly gathered the items. "Will that be credit card or cash,miss?"

"Credit card!" Ruby reached into her bag, though I could see the slight hesitation in her eyes. I knew Diana's prices were steep, and Ruby had probably just impulsively committed to spending several months' worth of her journalist salary.

Just as she extended her card, I intercepted it, pulling out my own card from my purse. "Use mine," I said pleasantly to the saleswoman."I promised to treat my friends, after all."

The saleswoman's eyes widened noticeably when she saw my card.She was about to say something, but I subtly shook my head. "Just run it,please."

She swiped the card with visible nervousness. "Is.., is there anything else you need, ma'am?" Her tone had shifted dramatically, now filled with deference.
Ruby and Scarlett both eyed my card curiously, clearly wondering what kind of plastic could cause such a reaction.

Victoria and her group were equally curious. I could see Victoria's frustration building as she watched the saleswoman's sudden change in attitude. Being Diana's spokesperson clearly didn't carry as much weight as whatever was in my wallet.

"Summer," Victoria said, her voice dripping with artificial concern, "I thought I was treating everyone today! With your salary...these pieces aren't exactly budget-friendly."

She let her words trail off, but the implication was clear to everyone listening.

I tucked my card back into my wallet with a small smile. "Don't worry about it. I might not earn as much as you, but Stark Group has excellent benefits. I can certainly afford this."

"Right, of course," Victoria recovered quickly. "I forgot you work for Stark Group! We're practically colleagues. I'm with Stark Entertainment, after all.Small world,Summer!"

"I know," I replied, my smile genuine now. "I saw you at the Stark Group annual gala. You performed on stage. Quite the impressive show."
###Chapter 276: Brandon's Nearby

**Summer's POV**

Victoria's smile flickered for a second before she recovered. "That's right!And Brandon seemed to enjoy it too. Actually, speaking of Brandon..."She leaned in conspiratorially, her voice dropping to a stage whisper. "We all noticed how friendly you two were that night. Quite cozy, if I'm not mistaken."


The atmosphere instantly chilled. Nancy's head whipped toward Victoria so fast I thought she might give herself whiplash.

"Victoria! That's enough!" Nancy snapped, her face flushing red. She tugged at Victoria's arm with unexpected force. "Let's go shop elsewhere."

I couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. Interesting reaction from Nancy.Apparently, some topics were still off-limits, even for her precious daughter-in-law.

"Mrs. Stark," I said calmly, "I don't think you've thought this through.Victoria is Diana's brand ambassador now. It's a matter of professional reputation. If you storm out right now to shop at a competitor's store..." I let my voice trail off meaningfully.

Nancy's mouth opened and closed without sound.

I continued, pressing my advantage. "Plus, Diana is under the Stark Group umbrella, just like Stark Entertainment where Victoria works. Actually, this entire mall is Stark Group property. So wherever you shop today,you'll still be spending money at a Stark business."

Nancy looked like she'd swallowed something particularly sour."You-"

"Summer!" VVictoria cut in, her voice rising with fake indignation. "How can you speak to Mom like that? She's your elder!"
I couldn't help but laugh. "She's *your* mother-in-law, not mine. And honestly. I speak to my own mother this way too,so..."

Victoria's eyes narrowed dangerously. She stepped closer,lowering her voice to ensure only our little groupcould hear.

"I know you're still upset about Alexander and me," she said, her voice dripping with false sympathy. "But Alexander and I truly love each other.If you need to blame someone, blame me-not Mom. You shouldn't involve her in your resentment."

The sheer audacity of her statement left me momentarily speechless.Ruby and Scarlett exchanged glances before both of them búrst into poorly concealed laughter.

Victoria's head snapped toward them. "Summer, is this how your friends behave? Laughing at people for no reason?"

I gave her a wide-eyed innocent look. "What's wrong with laughing?Would you prefer they cry instead?"

Ruby snorted again, which only made Victoria's face darken further.

"Look," I said, deciding to change tactics. "Victorid, why don't you help your mother-in-law pick out some more clothes? Diana's quality is exceptional-it would suit your style perfectly." I gestured toward Nancy's friends who were still hovering nearby. "Ladies, please pick whatever catches your eye. I'm in a generous mood today. Stark Group just gave me a nice holiday bonus, so I can handle it!"

The transformation in the women's attitudes was both immediate and hilarious.

"What a sweet girl!" one of them cooed, her earlier disdain magically vanished. "Victoria's sister is just delightful, isn't she? Well, if you insist,dear..."
"Nancy,you should pick something too," I added with a bright smile. "It's the holidays-let's celebrate!"

Nancy looked thoroughly confused by this turn of events, her eyes darting between me and Victoria as if trying to decode what was happening.

Victoria wasn't about to let me have the last word. "Summer, I already said I'd treat everyone today. You don't need to spend your money. I know things must be tight on your Stark Group salary, even with a bonus. Your position there isn't exactly executive level."

Ruby and Scarlett both shot me concerned looks.

"Summer, you don't have to do this," Scarlett whispered. "That's way too much money!"

"It's fine," I whispered back. "Just enjoy the show."

Victoria leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper."Summer, be honest with your big sister. Have you... you know...found yourself a rich boyfriend? Is that where all this money is coming from?"

The insinuation was crystal clear-and exactly what I'd expected from her.

I smiled sweetly. "Victoria, have you forgotten? My current boyfriend is actually the one you and Mom set me up with."

Her brow furrowed in confusion, but before she could respond, I noticed movement by the store entrance. Everyone followed my gaze as I stared past Victoria's shoulder.

A man was leaning against the glass door, arms crossed casually over his chest. His sharp features were partially shadowed in the backlighting.but the amused smirk on his face was unmistakable. His eyes were fixed directly on me, watching the scene unfold with obvious entertainment.
"What are you doing here?" I asked, genuinely surprised.

Dr. Sean pushed himself off the doorframe anid strolled toward us, hands in his pockets, looking every bit the wealthy heir he was pretending to be.

"Just checking on you," he replied casually. "Thought I'd see how your shopping trip was going."

Ruby's eyes widened as she looked between us. I gave her a tiny, almost imperceptible nod.

Sean approached our group and extended his hand to Nancy. "Hello, I'm Jesse Turner of the Philadelphia Turners. Summer's boyfriend."

Victoria's jaw literally dropped. "Turner? As in *the* Turner family?"

Ruby recovered quickly, jumping into the charade. "Oh! You're the guy Summer's been telling me about!" She elbowed me playfully. "You didn't mention he was so handsome!"

Sean turned to Victoria, his expression pleasantly neutral, though I could see the dangerous gleam in his eyes. "Victoria Taylor, right? We've met before, I believe. At the Stark Group gala?" His smile sharpened almost imperceptibly."I hope you're not suggesting anything inappropriate about my girlfriend and Brandon Stark. The Turners don't take kindly to such...insinuations."

Victoria paled visibly. "Mr. Turner! Of course not! I was just-I mean-I would never imply-"

"Wonderful," Sean cut her off smoothly. "I'd hate for there to be any misunderstandings."

He leaned close to my ear, whispering so only I could hear."Brandon's nearby."
My eyes widened. "Really?"

He nodded slightly. "Saw you were in trouble."

Sean turned back to the group, his arm sliding comfortably around my waist. "Whatever my girlfriend wants, please add it to the bill. In fact, just box up everything she and her friends picked out."

I gently removed his hand. "I've got this," I said firmly, handing my card to the saleswoman again.

The woman took it with a reverent nod. "Right away, Mrs.-" She caught herself, eyes widening. "I mean,Miss Taylor."

Victoria's eyes narrowed at the slip.

I smiled at the saleswoman. "Please make sure these items are delivered to the ladies as well," I said, gesturing toward Nancy and her friends. "Just check their sizes before packaging."

"Of course, miss," the saleswoman replied,practically bowing.

Sean offered his arm to me. "My car's downstairs. Shall we grab dinner,ladies? My treat."

"We'd love to!" Ruby replied, shooting Victoria a triumphant look.

As we headed toward the door, Sean paused to look back at Victoria."Victoria, always a pleasure. We should catch up properly sometime."

The look of utter confusion on Victoria's face as we walked out was worth every penny I'd just spent.
###Chapter 277: Showing Off

**Summer's POV**

The moment we stepped outside Diana, Ruby burst into laughter, nearly doubling over.


"Oh my God! Did you see Victoria's face?" she wheezed between giggles."I thought she was going to pass out when you mentioned the Turner family!



Scarlett joined in. "The way those women did a complete one-eighty the second they thought you had money... priceless!"

I smiled at their reactions, though my mind was racing with what Sean had whispered. Brandon was nearby? My heart did a little flip at the thought.


Ruby composed herself and fixed me with asuspicious look. "Okay,seriously, what's going on here? You two-" she gestured between Sean and me,"-are clearly putting on some kind of show."

"It's just acting," I shrugged, then turned to Sean. "Where's Brandon now?You said he was nearby."

Sean clutched his chest in mock offense. "Wow, I swoop in to save the day,and all you can think about is where your husband is? That's cold.Summer." He shook his head dramatically. "Brandon's the same way. UJses me when it's convenient, then boom-nowhere to be found when I need backup."

Ruby snorted. "So you're the stand-in boyfriend, huh? The placeholder?"

"I prefer 'strategic relationship consultant,'" Sean replied with a grin. "You were pretty badass in there, by the way. The way you played along without missing a beat? Impressive."
Ruby beamed but still looked confused. "I feel like I'm missing something.What was that whole 'Jesse Turner' thing about? And why did Victoria look like she'd seen a ghost?"

Sean checked his watch. "We should continue this somewhere more private.Brandon and the others are waiting at Manhattan Club."




In Sean's Mercedes, I sat in front while Ruby and Scarlett settled in back.

"So Brandon's at Manhattan Club?" I asked, trying to sound casual.

Sean nodded. "With Edward, Ethan, and little firecracker Arya." He glanced at me. "He's going to kill me for not calling him when Victoria started giving you trouble."

"How did you even know I was having issues?Were you following me?"

Sean laughed. "Give me some credit, Summer. I have better things to do than stalk you around department stores." He tapped his phone. "Brandon has security detail on you. One of them spotted the confrontation and texted me since I was closest."

"Brandon has people watching me?" I wasn't sure whether to be annoyed or touched.

"For protection, not surveillance," Sean clarified. "After everything that's happened with the Sinclairs and Taylors? Of course he does."

"Wait, did you call Arya a 'little firecracker'? She always seems so quiet whenever I've seen her."

Sean snorted. "Quiet? That girl? Maybe she's on her best behavior around you. Trust me, get a few drinks in her, and she'll verbally eviscerate anyone who crosses her."
"Your sister's something else," Sean remarked, shaking his head. "The sheer audacity of that woman. Shameless, but entertaining."

Ruby and Scarletterupted in laughter again.

"How many people actually know about you and Brandon?" Ruby asked.

"Quite a few now," I admitted. "Wenever planned to keep it a total secret."

"And now I'm stuck in the middle, constantly being subjected to their disgusting lovey-dovey behavior," Sean complained.

"Who exactly is Jesse Turner?" Ruby pressed. "And why did Victoria look like she was about to have a stroke when you mentioned his name?"

"The Turners are serious players in Philadelphia high society," Scarlett explained. "Old money. Like, revolutionary war old."

"Jesse is Sean's cousin," I added. "Using his name was actually his idea.Helps keep things under the radar."




When we pulled up to Manhattan Club, a valet rushed forward.

"Dr. Sullivan! Welcome back, sir," he greeted with obvious respect.

"Thanks, Tommy," Sean replied, handing over his keys.

As we entered the building, Ruby whispered, "Is heactually a doctor? Or is that part of the act too?"

"He's a real surgeon," I confirmed.

Inside the elevator, Sean pressed the button for the eleventh floor. "This isn't the same place you came with Brandon before. This is my section of the club. Every member has their own area designed to their preferences."
"What's Ethan's like?" I asked curiously.

Sean rolled his eyes. "Boring. All clean lines and minimalism. Zero personality,just like him."

The elevator opened onto a plush corridor lined with discreet doors.Several well-dressed security men were stationed along the hallway,nodding respectfully as we passed.

Sean led us to the end of the hallway, pausing before an ornate door with a subtle 'S' engraved on a brass plate. "Welcome to my humble abode," he announced, pushing the door open.

The conversation inside immediately halted as four pairs of eyes turned to us. My gaze instantly locked with Brandon's across the room.

Brandon raised his hand, beckoning me over without a word. The gesture was so casually possessive that I felt my cheeks warm. Without thinking, I abandoned my friends at the door and crossed the room directly to my husband.

Brandon immediately pulled me into his lap, his strong arms encircling my waist. "Your hands are freezing," he murmured, taking my fingers between his warm palms.

I suddenly became very aware that we weren't alone. Edward Lee was watching us with amusement, while Ethan Kennedy maintained his usual stoic expression. Arya Carter sat beside Ethan, her eyes darting between Brandon and me with undisguised curiosity.

"Brandon," I whispered, trying to extract myself from his embrace."Everyone's watching."

His grip only tightened. "So? I'm holding my wife. Does anyone have a problem with that?" He directed this challenge to the room at large.
"The boss and his lady are clearly very much in love," Edward remarked with a smirk. "It's heartwarming,truly."

"Obviously," Brandon replied arrogantly.

"Jesus fucking Christ." Sean groaned from the doorway. "You see what I have to deal with? They're insufferable." He turned to Ruby and Scarlett."Come on in, ladies. Don't mind the shameless PDA happening over there."

Ruby looked starstruck. "The Wall Street Four," she whispered. "I can't believe I'm actually seeing them in person."

I felt my face heat up even more. "Brandon, please," I mumbled, trying again to stand up. "Let me at least say hello properly."

Brandon reluctantly loosened his hold, though he kept one hand firmly at the small of my back as I smiled awkwardly at the others.

"Hi, Ethan. Edward. Arya. It's nice to see you all again," I managed,painfully aware of how casual Brandon was being about our relationship.

Ethan, ever the most composed of the group, cleared his throat softly.His gaze flicked from me to Brandon. "Brandon," he said mildly, "you're overdoing it a bit, don't you think?"
###Chapter 278: Who

**Summer's POV**

Brandon lifted me from his lap and settled me into his seat, casually positioning himself on the armrest beside me. I felt my cheeks burn as every eye in the room fixed on us.

"Brandon!" I hissed. This wasn't like him at all. Public displays of affection in front of his closest friends? Who was this man and what had he done with my husband?

I cleared my throat, trying to break the awkward silence: "So, everyone's here! Is this like a regular meetup or something?"

The entire room stared at me like I'd asked if water was wet. Even Ruby and Scarlett exchanged a "really?" glance. I sank lower in my seat, wishing I could disappear.

"Don't be nervous, Mrs. Stark," Edward said smoothly. "You remember me.right? Edward Lee?"

"Of course I remember you, Edward!" I replied, grateful for the lifeline.

"Please, call me Edward," he said with a smile. "After all, you're practically family now."

Sean clapped his hands. "So what's the pln now? Where to next?"

"Dinner, obviously," he answered himself. "I've already arranged everything. Your friends are coming too," He nodded toward Ruby and Scarlett. "James already made the reservations."
Brandon made a soft, derisive sound. "My assistant, and you're ordering him around like he's yours?"
"Oh please," Sean scoffed. "Like you don't boss me around every chance
you get?"

"Let's head to Water Lounge," Sean announced. "Ladies, would you prefer to ride with me or Edward?"


Ruby and Scarlett exchanged another glance. "We'll stick with you, since we came with you."

I could practically read their thoughts. Edward might seem friendly, but there was something intimidating about him. And Ethan Kennedy? The man made Brandon look positively chatty.

"See that, Edward?" Sean gloated. "I told you people always prefer my company."

Edward responded with a noncommittal grunt before heading toward the door.

As everyone filed out, Arya shadowed Ethan to his car, Ruby and Scarlett followed Sean, and Edward walked alone to his vehicle.

Brandon and I were the last to leave. In the hallway, he pulled me close."So,what happened with Victoria? Sean mentioned trouble."

"Nothing major," I said. "You know Victoria-always making me feel small.She acts like I'm constantly trying to steal what's hers."

Brandon's lips curved into a dangerous smile. "Well, you do look very threatening."

I rolled my eyes and changed the subject. "Why this sudden meetup? And isn't Ethan supposed to be back in Philadelphia? I thought he was taking Arya to meet her family."

"He has his reasons," Brandon replied cryptically.

"Sean mentioned something else," I said as we stepped into the elevator. "
Do you have people following me?"

Brandon didn't deny it. "Security detail. For your protection."

"Since when?"

"Since things escalated with the Sinclairs," he replied matter-of-factly."They're discreet."


"If it bothers you, I can pull them back," he added. "But not right now."

I sighed. "No, it's fine. I get why you're doing it. It makes you feel better,and after everything that's happened... maybe it's not such a bad idea."

His arm tightened around my waist. I knew I'd made the right call.


Water Lounge was exactly what I'd expect from the Wall Street Four-exclusive, elegant, and subtly ostentatious. The manager practically fell over himseIf greeting us, leading us to the largest private dining room.

"Dr. Sullivan has arranged everything," he explained. "Mr. Wilson provided detailed instructions for the menu."

Brandon and I were the last to arrive. Everyone was already seated with cocktaíls, perfectly at ease.

"Finally! The love-struck teenagers arrive," Sean called out."Brandon,would it kill you to go five minutes without showing off? The rest of us are single,you know."

"Yes," Brandon replied simply,pulling out my chair.

Sean launched into a dramatic retelling of the Diana incident, complete with impressions of Victoria's horrified expression when he'd introduced himself as Jesse Turner.
"Ruby here was brilliant," he declared. "With that kind of verbal sparring.you should've been a lawyer instead of a journalist."

Ruby snorted. "Why would I want to be a lawyer? I know nothing about law. I'm practically legally illiterate." She took a sip of wine. "Besides,I was on the track team in college. Both sprints and distance. That was my real talent."


"Oh my God, yes!" I laughed. "Ruby was so fast! This guy from engineering had a crush on her-when he finally asked her out,she literally sprinted away. Poor guy couldn't even come close to catching her."

"So that's why you're single," Sean teased. "You outrun all your suitors."

Ruby's eyes narrowed. "That's rich coming from you, Dr. Sullivan. Last time I checked, you're just as single as I am. Let's not throw stones from that glass house."

The entire table erupted in laughter. Even Edward smiled, which only made Sean turn on him.

"What are you laughing at? You're just as painfully single as I am!"

As dinner progressed, Ruby and Scarlett visibly relaxed. Meanwhile,Brandon appointed himself my personal waiter, peeling one jumbo shrimp after another for my plate.

"I can't eat anymore," I protested as he added yet another one.

"Just one more," he insisted. "Last one."

I looked down and realized I'd somehow consumed an entire platter of shrimp. Brandon's side was littered with shells-evidence of his dedlicated service.

A knock interrupted us. The manager appeared, looking apologetic.
"Mr. Stark, there's someone asking to see you," he said nervously. "A Mr.Sinclair? He sald you'd recognize the name."

Brandon calmly placed one final shrimp on my plate. "Take him to the Sunset Room. I'll be there shortly."

"Your uncle?" Sean asked, suddenly serious.

Brandon nodded, pushing back his chair. He whispered in my ear, "Stay here. Eat something." Then he was gone.

What was wrong with him today? First the excessive PDA, then the shrimp-peeling service, and now these cryptic instructions to eat more?

Ten minutes later, Brandon returned, looking remarkably relaxed-even pleased. Whatever conversation he'd had with Jeffrey Sinclair had clearly gone well.

"Why is everyone staring at me?" he asked, reclaiming his seat.

I reached for the rice and spooned some onto his plate. "How did it go?"I asked softly.

His eyes met mine, a predatory satisfaction gleaming in their depths."Perfectly."
###Chapter 279: Dark Schemes

**Summer's POV**

I was about to ask him what Jeffrey wanted when his phone rang.Brandon glanced at the screen, then answered immediately.

"James," he said simply, his voice low.

I couldn't hear what James was saying, but Brandon's eyes narrowed slightly.


"Mr. Stark," James's voice came through clearly enough for me to catch, "Jeffrey Sinclair lingered outside your private room for several minutes before leaving!"

"I know," Brandon replied calmly, taking another bite of his food.

"So what should we do now, Mr. Stark?" James asked.

Brandon set down his fork, his expression shifting into something colder."Hold position for now. Tomorrow morning, I want you to find Jeffrey and take him to see Elle."

I started to spoon more rice onto his plate, but he subtly shook his head,stopping me.

"And increase her dosage," he added, his voice completely emotionless."Then let Jeffrey see her."

The entire table fell silent. Everyone had heard him. Ruby and Scarlett exchanged alarmed glances, clearly wondering what kind of conversation they'd just witnessed. I felt my own stomach tighten at Brandon's casual cruelty.

Ethan Kennedy and Edward Lee barely reacted, their expressions remaining neutral. Whatever Brandon was doing, they'd obvíously seen it
coming.

Dr. Sean, however, looked genuinely disturbed. "Brandon, have you lost your mind?" he hissed. "You're messing with her meds now? At my hospital? Are you trying to get my license revoked?"

Brandon's lips curved into a cold smile. "Jeffrey needs a lesson in consequences," he said simply. "He doesn't respond to anything else."

"What are you talking about?" Sean demanded.

"Jeffrey is predictable," Brandon explained, setting his phone down. "Elle is his playing piece. As long as she's a viable option, he'll never stop pushing. But if his piece is... compromised..." He let the implication hang in the air.


"You're basically suggesting we make her appear more mentally unstable to scare him off," Sean translated, running a hand through his hair. "Jesus Christ."

"I'd prefer not to directly engage the Sinclair family unless absolutely necessary," Brandon continued, his tone clinical. "They've been fixtures in Washington DC for over a century. That's not a battle I'm looking to start right now."


Sean threw up his hands. "Fine. Whatever. I've gotta hand it to you though-you really do think of everything."

"I don't like wasting effort," Brandon replied.

James cleared his throat. "Mr. Stark. The staff monitoring Elle mentioned she's been muttering strange things lately. Keeps saying 'go away'and something about a child."

Brandon's head snapped up. "A child?"
"Yes. sir," James confirmed.

Brandon's eyes darted to Sean, something unspoken passing between them.
"Do psychiatric patients typically talk in coherent patterns?"

Sean's face paled as he caught Brandon's meaning. "You can't possibly think-"


"Brandon, you..." I started, the implication hitting me like a truck.

Brandon turned to Edward. "Edward, looks like I'll need your assistance again."


Edward nodded, his expression grim. "Don't forget what you promised me.



"Within the next few days," Brandon assured him. "I'll arrange the meeting. What happens after that is up to you."

"Agreed," Edward replied simply.

I glanced around the table. Ruby and Scarlett looked completely lost,while Ethan and Arya maintained their stoic expressions. Only I seemed to understand part of what was happening-Brandon was using Elle to manipulate Jeffrey, but there was clearly more going on than he was letting on.





After dinner,Sean offered to take Ruby and Scarlett home. Edward and Ethan left separately with Arya, while Brandon and I headed to his car.
Once we were alone, I turned to him. "What exactly did you mean by increasing Elle's dosage? Don't tell me her current breakdown is somehow connected to you?"

Brandon glanced at me, one eyebrow raised. "What do you want to know.
exactly?"

"Nothing," I said quíckly, shaking my head. But deep down, I was worried.Was Brandon doing terrible things for my sake? The thought made my stomach churn.


"Stop overthinking," Brandon said softly, reaching over to smooth the wrinkle between my brows. "Your face gives away everything you're thinking. Do you really believe your husband is that incompetent?"

His confidence was reassuring. Whatever Brandon was doing, he clearly had every angle covered. I relaxed slightly, leaning into his touch.

"What were you and Edward talking about earlier?" I asked, changing the subject. "It seemed serious."

"Grace," Brandon replied simply.

"Grace?" The name sounded vaguely familiar.

"Her birth name is Grace Stark, though she later changed it to Katniss Kennedy," Brandon explained. "She's Gavin Stark's biological daughter."

"Your uncle's daughter?" I asked, surprised. "What's her connection to Edward?"

"Grace and Edward met before anyone knew who she really was,"Brandon said, "They were together for a while. I knew about their relationship, but at the time, I had no idea she was my cousin."

"So how did everyone find out?"

"Gavin's wife, Meave, got sick and needed a bone marrow transplant."Brandon continued. "That's when they discovered the daughter they'd raised for over twenty years wasn't biologically theirs. They eventually tracked down Grace."
"So the Starks brought her back into the family?" I asked.

Brandon shook his head. "Not exactly. By then, she was already with Edward, and they seemed happy together. Gavin and Meave didn't want to disrupt that."

"So what happened?"

"There was... a misunderstanding between Grace and Edward," Brandon said carefully. "Grace left afterward. That was three years ago. She hasn't been back since."

"Three years?" I gasped. "Why didn't he go looking for her?"

Brandon gave me a pointed look. "Who said he didn't?"

"Oh." Realization dawned. "He's been searching all this time?"

Brandon nodded. "Without pause. That's why I'm helping him. Grace isn't just my cousin-she's precious to Gavin and Meave."

"What's your plan?" I asked. "I imagine it's complicated, since Grace is their daughter, and Edward and Grace's misunderstanding is still unresolved."

"I'm going to start with Meave," Brandon replied.

"But isn't her health fragile?" I worried.

Brandon smiled. "Meave is stronger than she appears. But for now.we need to keep this from Gavin."

"Gavin doesn't approve of Edward?" I guessed.

"He hadreservations from the beginning," Brandon confirmed."Gavin was overjoyed to find his long-lost daughter, only to see her hurt by someone from the Lee family."
"Is that why Stark Group hasn't collaborated with Lee Enterprises in years?"I asked,connecting the dots.

Brandon chuckled. "Gavin acts tough, but he can be childish sometimes.If keeping away from Lee makes him feel better, so be it."

"But doesn't Edward need the Stark Group's support?" I asked. "For Lee Enterprises?"


"That's where you're wrong," Brandon replied. "Everyone assumes Edward's primary concern is Lee Enterprises, but it's not. It never has been."

"How do you know?"

"Edward has his own company," Brandon revealed. "One with enough resources to absorb Lee Enterprises entirely if he wanted to."

"Then why hasn't he done it?"

"Because Edward's priorities lie elsewhere," Brandon said simply. "He's done a lot for Grace. That's why I'm willing to help him now."

I leaned back against the seat, trying to process everything Brandon had shared. The world he moved in was so much more complex than I'd ever imagined-filled with old grudges, family secrets, and hidden agendas.But as complicated as it all seemed, one thing was clear: in Brandon's world,loyalty and love were worth fighting for, no matter the cost.
###Chapter 280: Give Me Back My Child

**James's POV**

The sunrise hadn't even touched the Manhattan skyline when I arrived at The Peninsula. The luxury hotel stood silent in the pre-dawn darkness.My phone buzzed with a message from Mr. Stark: *Proceed as planned.Report everything.*

Jeffrey Sinclair-Washington power broker,Sinclair family pillar, and Mr.Stark's uncle-was staying in the presidential suite. At precisely 7:00 AM.I knocked on his door.


"Who is it?" A wary voice called from inside.

"Mr.Sinclair, I'm James Wilson, Mr. Stark's assistant," I replied,keeping my tone neutral and professional.

The door opened just enough to reveal Jeffrey's face. The man looked terrible-eyes bloodshot, silver hair disheveled, designer pajamas wrinkled.He'd clearly spent the night tossing and turning.

"What do you want?" he demanded, not bothering with pleasantries.

"Mr. Stark instructed me to escort you to see Miss Sinclair this morning," I explained. "She's currently at Manhattan General. Her condition is stable."

The color drained from Jeffrey's face. "Elle is in the hospital? Since when?"

"For a few days now, sir. Mr. Stark believed you'd want to see her as soon as possible."

He hesitated, suspicion warring with concern. "Give me fifteen minutes."




The private wing of Manhattan General Hospital.
Jeffrey remained silent as I led him through the private wing,his eyes darting nervously around the pristine corridors. By the time we reached Elle's room,beads of sweat had formed on his forehead.

"This is Miss Sinclair's room. Mr. Sinclair. I should warn you-"

A blood-curdling scream cut through the air, followed by the sound of something shattering against a wal1. Jeffrey jumped like he'd been electrocuted.


"What the hell is going on in there?" he demanded, eyes wide with alarm.

I affected a concerned expression. "Has Miss Sinclair been experiencing...episodes lately? The hospital staff mentioned she's been talking to herself-saying things like 'go away' and something about a 'child."

Jeffrey's head snapped toward me. "What are you implying?"

"I'm not implying anything, sir," I replied carefully. "Mr. Stark has been keeping this situation under wraps. After all, Miss Sinclair did physically assault both Robert and Jane. That's a serious matter in New York society."

"What the f-" Jeffrey's face contorted with disbelief. "Are you saying Elle attacked Robert and Jane?"

"With a knife, sir. Mr. Stark chose not to involve the police out of respect for you, but Miss Sinclair was becoming increasingly dangerous.She nearly harmed WilliamStark as well. Mr. Stark had no choice but to have her brought here for treatment." I hesitated deliberately. "Regarding the child she keeps mentioning..."

"That's her pet dog," Jeffrey cut in quickly-too quickly. "She probably misses the damn thing. Look, now that I'm here, I'm taking Elle back with me. Open the door."
His explanation was so obviously fabricated that I had to fight to keep my
expression neutral. Mr. Stark would be very interested in this particular lie.

The moment I unlocked the door, it burst open from inside. Elle Sinclair-wild-eyed and disheveled in a hospital gown-lunged at Jeffrey with a feral scream.

"You monster! Give me back my child!" she shrieked, fingers curled into claws as she raked them down his face.

Blood immediately welled up from the scratches. Jeffrey staggered backward but managed to grab Elle's wrists.

"Elle, stop! It's me, Jeffrey! Your father!"

Elle thrashed violently in his grip, her face contorted with hatred."Father?Hahaha! I don't have a father! You're the bad man! The bad man! Give me back my child! Don't touch me!"

I watched impassively, cataloging every word and reaction exactly as Mr.Stark had instructed. Jeffrey struggled to control Elle as she kicked and screamed.

"What the hell are you standing there for?" he shouted at me. "Help me!"

"Get a doctor! We need a sedative!" I called out, finally moving to assist him.

It took both of us plus two orderlies to hold Elle down while a doctor administered a sedative. Within moments, her struggles weakened,and her eyes grew unfocused. The raw hatred in her expression slowly melted into confusion,then vacancy as the drugs took effect.
Jeffrey stood panting, blood trickling down his cheek where Elle's nails had left deep gouges.
"Mr. Sinclair, your face-" I began.
"I'm fine," he cut me off, his voice hard. "I'm taking Elle with me now."

"Of course," I replied smoothly. "As Mr. Stark said, Miss Sinclair is your adopted daughter. You're free to take her whenever you wish."

Jeffrey's eyes narrowed at my phrasing, but he said nothing as he gathered Elle's limp form. The doctor provided discharge papers, which Jeffrey signed without reading. Within twenty minutes, they were gone-Jeffrey supporting a heavily sedated Elle toward the parking garage where his driver waited.




"Did you get everything?" I asked Dr. Sullivan as soon as Jeffrey was safely out of earshot.

Sean nodded, pulling out his phone and tapping the screen. "Full video and audio from three angles. The AI enhancement picked up everything.She definitely said 'child,' not 'dog."

"Send it to me now."

An hour later, I set a tablet on Mr. Stark's desk, the video already queued up. He watched silently, his expression betraying nothing as Elle screamed about a child and Jeffrey scrambled to control the situation.

"He seemed surprised by her condition?" Mr. Stark asked, his voice measured.

"Very," I confirmed. "But his reaction to the mention of a child was...telling. He immediately fabricated a story about a pet dog. The explanation came too quickly to be spontaneous."
"Your observational skiIls are improving," Mr. Stark noted, rewinding the video to watch Elle's outburst again, "Investigate this. Find out what Jeffrey is hiding."
"Yes,sir."

"And Elle's references to 'bad man'and 'child'-dig into those as well. If you're too busy, borrow Landon from Edward. He's more skilled at this type of research anyway."

"Understood,sir."


"A pet dog?" Mr. Stark's mouth curved into a cold smile. "Elle Sinclair used to torture animals as a child."


The fact that Mr. Stark knew such a detail about his cousin's childhood didn't surprise me. He left nothing to chance, especially when it came to potential threats.

"What about the photographs?" I asked. "Have they all been removed?"

"Are they?" Mr. Stark countered, watching me closely.

"Yes, sir. I've personally verified that all traces have been eliminated from the Stark residence. The photographs themselves have been destroyed completely." I hesitated. "Though, Mrs. Sinclair might have seen them.Could she pose a problem?"
"Even if she talks, it won't matter," Mr. Stark replied dismissively. "When is Jeffrey leaving New York?"

"I checked his flight information. The day after tomorrow."

"And Elle is with him at the hotel now?"

"Yes, sir. He brought a doctor to the hotel. They're likely treating her as we speak."
Mr.Stark leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled under his chin."Find some baby pictures," he said suddenly. "Since Elle mentioned a child, let's see how Jeffrey and my mother react to that particular stimulus."
"Infant photos specifically, sir?" I clarified.

"Yes. Let's see what kind of reaction we get."
###Chapter 281: Helping Edward Meet Meave

**Summer's POV**

I was rolling around on Brandon's ridiculously expensive leather sofa,completely losing it at the comedy I was streaming. Tears streamed down my face as I clutched a pillow to my chest, laughing so hard my stomach hurt.


"Oh my God,"I wheezed between giggles. "This is-" I couldn't even finish my sentence.

That prickling sensation of being watched made me turn. Brandon was leaning against the staircase railing, arms crossed, an amused smile playing on his lips.

"Brandon!" I yelped, immediately sitting up and trying to smooth down my messy bun. I probably looked like a disaster in my sweatpants and his oversized t-shirt.

"Your meeting's over?" I asked, hastiy wiping away tears of laughter. "I saw James leaving earlier."

Brandon nodded and crossed the room, settling beside meand taking my hand in his.

"What are you watching?" he asked, thumb tracing circles on my skin.

"Just a silly comedy," I replied."Want to watch with me?"

"Continue where you left off," he said, pressing a kiss to my forehead.

I snuggled against him, restarting the show. After a few minutes, Brandon spoke up.
"Why don't you call Meave and invite her over?"
I paused the show, looking up at him."Meave? Just her alone?"

Brandon smiled slightly. "Yeah."

"Does Ethan want to see her again?" I guessed.

"No." Brandon replied. "Not Ethan this time."

"Then who?"

"Edward Lee."

I sat up straighter. "Because of Grace?"

Brandon nodded silently.

"If Meave can really help bring Grace back, why didn't Edward ask for her help before?" I frowned. "Why wait three years?"

"Time is the best healer," Brandon explained. "Back then, Grace was determined to leave. Even Gavin and Meave probably couldn't have stopped her."

He pulled me closer. "Their misunderstanding was too deep. Forcing Grace to stay wouldn't have fixed anything."

"Besides," he continued, "Gavin was prejudiced against Edward then. Even now, he'd oppose Edward meeting with Meave."

"So I need to invite Meave without Gavin finding out?" I swatted his arm."You're making me the bad guy! If Gavin finds out, I'm the one in trouble!"
Brandon caught my hand, eyes amused. "Gavin won't blame you. Besides.you're just the accomplice-I'm the mastermind."
I rolled my eyes. "Fine! I'll call her now!"

"Good," Brandon nodded.
Meave picked up on the third ring, sounding surprised but pleased to hear from me. When I suaggested getting out of the house, she practically lit up.

"That would be lovely," she said warmly. "It's been ages since I've had a proper girls' day out."

"Will Gavin be okay with it?" I asked.

Meave sighed. "Being cooped up at home is driving me crazy. Besides,Gavin's been so busy lately, he barely has time for me."

"How about today?" I suggested. "Brandon can drive us."

"Perfect," she agreed. "Give me an hour to get ready?"

After hanging up, I turned to Brandon. "She seemed really excited."

Guilt immediately crept in. "But what if she gets mad when she sees Edward? I'm basically tricking her!"

Brandon shook his head. "Don't worry. Meave rarely gets angry. And if she does, it'll be directed at me,not you."

He pulled me to my feet. "Now go change. We need to pick up Meave soon."




In Brandon's Bentley, I sat in the back with Meave, who looked elegant despite her frailty.
"It's so good to see you," I said, genuinely happy to spend time with her.

"You too, Summer," Meave smiled, patting my hand. "How have things been with you and Brandon? I've heard all sorts of rumors."
"We're good," I replied, catching Brandon's eye in the mirror.

"That night was quite the drama," she continued. "The whole Stark family was in an uproar."

She shook her head. "I'm just glad Elle Sinclair is gone now. Things should be much calmer for you two."

"You're absolutely right," Brandon agreed, his voice unusually warm.

I gazed out the window, suddenly realizing our direction. "Where are we going?"


"Summer's coffee shop," Brandon replied.

I turned to Meave, thinking fast. "Meave, my friend Scarlett has a private room there.Would you like to check it out?"

"That sounds wonderful!" she exclaimed. "I didn't know you had an interest in coffee shops."

"It's just a hobby," I explained. "Professor Thompson taught me tea preparation and coffee when I was younger, and Scarlett shares my love for them."

Brandon caught my eye in the mirror, approving my quick thinking.




At the coffee shop, Scarlett was arranging flowers when we arrived.Her eyes widened in surprise.
"Summer! I didn't know you were coming today!" She glanced at Meave."And who's this?"

"This is Meave Stark, Brandon's aunt," I introduced.
"Mrs. Stark, welcome!" Scarlett smiled warmly. "Please, come in."

"You must be the friend Summer mentioned," Meave said.

"Yes, this is Scarlett Smith," I confirmed as Brandon joined us.

"Are just you and Mrs. Stark visiting?" Scarlett asked.

"No, Brandon's here too. He was just parking."

Scarlett led us toward the back. "I've set up the VIP room for Summer.You know the way,right?"

"Absolutely," I nodded, taking Meave's arm as Scarlett went to prepare refreshments.

The private room was tastefully decorated with Eastern and Western elements. Meave ådmired the hand-painted screens and carefully arranged tea sets.

"Did you design all this?" she asked.

"I did," I smiled. "I wanted to comnbine Eastern tranquility with Western comfort."

Brandon sat quietly in the corner, occasionally checking his phone. At one point, he stepped away to make a call, speaking too softly for me to hear.
As we settled with our tea, I heard footsteps approaching. A light knock sounded at the door.

Brandon rose to answer it.

Edward Lee stood in the doorway, impeccably dressed despite having clearly rushed over. His usually cold demeanor seemed softer today.
Meave froze, her teacup halfway to her lips. Scarlett, returning with pastries.
glanced between us all before catching my subtle hint.

"Tll bring more tea," she said tactfully, backing away.

Meave set down her cup, eyes fixed on Edward. The tension was palpable-not hostile, but heavy with history.

"Edward," she finally said, voice carefully neutral.

"Mrs. Stark," he replied, remaining at the threshold.

Meave looked from Brandon to me, understanding dawning. "This is about Grace, isn't it?"

Neither Brandon nor Edward answered, but their silence was confirmation enough.

Meave's expression tightened. I could almost see her thoughts-memories of her daughter, the pain of these years, Gavin's disapproval.

Brandon looked at me expectantly. My turn.

"Meave," I began gently, "Edward wanted to speak with you. But if you don't want to see him, we can ask him to leave."

Edward remained still,respecting whatever decision Meave would make.

When she didn't respond, my anxiety spiked. "I'm so sorry. Maybe we didn't think this through. If you really don't want to see him. I'll have Brandon take him away."

Brandon shifted. "I'm sorry, Meave. Perhaps you're not ready. Maybe another time-"

"No," Meave interrupted, her voice quiet but firm. Her eyes held a mixture of resignation and resolve. "Let him come in."
###Chapter 282: Waiting For Her

**Summer's POV**

Edward stepped fully into the room, his usual confidence seemingly diminished in her presence. There was an odd reverence in the way he approached her-like a man meeting royalty.

"Thank you-" he began.

"Let's cut to the chase," Meave said, straightening in her chair. "You clearly went to great lengths to arrange this meeting, even convincing Brandon to participate in your little scheme." Her eyes briefly flicked to me, not accusatory but knowing. "This must be incredibly important to you.So tell me, what is it that brings you here today?"

Edward didn't hesitate."Grace."

The single word hung in the air like a grenade with its pin pulled. Meave's face remained impressively neutral, but I caught the slight tremor in her hand as she reached for her teacup.

"I assumed as much," she responded."It's been what, three years since the divorce?I'm not sure what you expect meto-"

"We never divorced," Edward interrupted, his voice breaking slightly.

I blinked in surprise, catching Brandon's equally startled expression from across the room.

"What did you say?" Meave asked, setting down her cup with a sharp clink.

Edward leaned forward, his eyes intense. "Grace and I were never divorced.Our marriage is still legally binding."
Meave stared at him, clearly processing this revelation. “Thats
unexpected. But a three-year separation is grounds for divorce in most states. Why hold onto a legal technicality when the relationship is clearly over?"


"Because it's not over," Edward insisted, a hint of desperation creeping into his usually controlled voice. "Not for me."

Meave's expression hardened. "If Grace chose to leave, that means she wanted out. If she's moved on, why can't you?"

"How?" Edward asked, the word coming out raw and anguished. "How could I possibly move on from Grace?"

The naked emotion in his voice startled me. I'd always seen Edward as Brandon's coolly calculated friend-brilliant and ambitious,but emotionally distant. This vulnerability was completely unexpected.

Meave seemed unmoved. "I'm sorry, Mr. Lee, but whatever you came to ask of me today, if it involves Grace, my answer is no. I won't help you."

Brandon cleared his throat, drawing everyone's attention. "Summer and I need to check on something with Scarlett. We'll give you two some privacy."


His eyes met mine, signaling me to follow his lead. As we headed for the door, I caught the warning glance he shot Edward-a clear message to behave himself.

"Do you think leaving them alone is a good idea?" I whispered once we were in the hallway.

Brandon's hand settled reassuringly at the small of my back. "Edward won't cross any lines. And they both need to speak freely without an audience."
When we returned nearly thirty minutes later, Edward was gone. Meave sat alone, staring contemplatively into her teacup, the steam rising in delicate spirals.


"He left?" Brandon asked, though it was obvious.

Meave nodded, not looking up. "He did."

I settled back into my seat across from her. "Are you okay?"

"He still loves her," Meave said softly, as if speaking to herself rather than answering my question. "After alI this time, after everything... he's still waiting for her."


Brandon took the seat Edward had vacated. "What exactly did he say to you?"

"He explained that there was a misunderstanding three years ago," Meave replied. "He admitted he wasn't there when Grace needed him most, but insisted it wasn't because he didn't care." She sighed. "He's been searching for her without success, despite all his resources. He wanted my help to find her."


"And your response?" Brandon pressed.

"I asked if he'd considered that Grace might not want to be found," Meave said. "That perhaps the reason he couldn't locate her was because she didn't want him to."

I winced at the harshness of the question, imagining how Edward must have felt hearing it.
"I told him to let her go," Meave continued. "That if he'd managed without her for three years, clearly hislife could continue without her in it."
"Harsh," I murmured.
"But honest," Brandon countered. "What was his reaction?"

Meave's expression softened slightly. "He said something that caught me off guard. He said. 'I never thought she wouldn't want me." She paused.her eyes distant with memory. "There was such raw disbelief in his voice.Like the possibility had never even occurred to him until that moment."

"And then?" Brandon prompted.

"He said he'd keep waiting for her. That there was no one else in his life.and never would be." Meave set down her cup. "His exact words were,'Only her, because after waiting for her, I can never wwait for anyone else."

I felt my chest tighten at the sentiment. Despite everything I knew about Edward-the cold businessman, the ruthless competitor-in that moment,
I couldn't help but see him as simply a man who had lost the woman he loved.

"Meave," Brandon said carefully, "it's not just Edward looking for Grace.I've been searching too."

Her head snapped up in surprise. "You have?"

"Think about it," Brandon continued. "Between EdwardI's resources and mine, we should have been able to locate her within days, let alone years.Doesn't it strike you as odd that we haven't?"

Understanding dawned in Meave's eyes. "Someone's hiding her?"

"Or preventing you from finding her," I suggested. "Could someone be intercepting your communications?"

Brandon's expression darkened. "The Lee family's internal dynamics are more complicated than you might imagine. Edward's uncle, Saul Pena,is returning to New York."
Meave paled visibly. "You think Grace is in danger?"

"I think," Brandon said carefully, "that those three 'accidents'Grace experienced three years ago-all while Edward was conveniently absent-might not have been accidents at all."


"Oh God." Meave whispered, a hand fluttering to her throat. "You believe someone targeted her then, and might still be watching her now?"

Brandon nodded gravely. "Grace is Edward's greatest vulnerability.As long as he cares for her, she remains a potential target for anyone wishing to control or harm him."


"Are you suggesting she should be with Edward for protection?" Meave asked,her voice strained.

"Grace faces danger regardless of where she is," Brandon replied. "At least with Edward, she'd have someone willing to do anything to keep her safe."

Tears gathered in Meave's eyes. "Do you think I don't want my daughter back? That I don't miss her every single day?" She shook her head. "But if being here makes her unhappy, I'd rather she stay away and find peace elsewhere."

"Just... consider what I've said," Brandon urged. "Think about what Edward told you."

Meave wiped away a stray tear, "I need time to process all this. To think about what's best for Grace."

"Of course," I said, reaching across to squeeze her hand. "Take all the time you need."
"I should tell you though," Meave added, looking up at Brandon,"I truly don't have any way to contact Grace. She calls me sometimes from blocked numbers, and I've respected her wish for distance. Even if I wanted to
help Edward. I couldn't lead him to her."
###Chapter 283: TheInevitable Truth

Brandon's POV

"Aunt Meave, I'll handle Grace's situation," I assured her, watching how her eyes lit up at the mention of her daughter's name. "You don't need to worry about her safety."

Meave's fingers tightened around her teacup. "I need to think about this some more," she said quietly. "Grace was so determined to disappear. If she wanted to be found, wouldn't she have reached out by now?"

I could see the conflict in her eyes-the desperate desire to find her daughter warring with the fear that forcing Grace to return might push her further away.

"If you're not ready to make a decision," I offered, "perhaps we should head back? It's getting late."

Summer shot me a concerned look from across the table.

Meave nodded, setting down her cup. "I already told Gavin I'd be staying at your Hamptons estate for a couple of days. He agreed it would be good for me to get away from the city."

Just as I stood to leave, my phone vibrated in my pocket. Stark Manor's number flashed on the screen. I hesitated briefly before answering.

"Mr. Stark," the family butler's voice came through, tense and formal."your grandfather urgently requestyour presence."

Before I could respond, I heard a commotion on the other end. followed by my grandfather's voice as he apparently snatched the phone away.
"Come back immediately." William Stark's voice was cold with barely contained fury.
I sat back down, my expression carefully neutral despite the alarm bells ringing in my head. William never called me directly unless something significant had happened.

"What's the matter?" I asked calmly.

"You have the audacity to ask me what's wrong?" he spat. "You know damn well what you've done."

Summer and Meave exchanged concerned glances.

"Grandfather, perhaps you could clarify the situation," I replied evenly,though I was beginning to suspect what this might be about.

"Were you at the manor earlier today?" he demanded. "Was there a woman in your car?"

I felt my body tense automatically. The atmosphere in the room shifted as my demeanor changed-Summer immediately sensed it, her eyes widening slightly.

"That woman-when did she return to New York?" William continued,his voice rising. "Didn't you send her away years ago?"

"You're mistaken," I cut in firmly.

"Don't lie to me!" he barked. "Her face..."

I interrupted before he could continue. "Grandfather, this is a misunderstanding."

"Is she one of your employees at Stark Group?" The accusation in his tone was unmistakable, "I'm warning you, break things off with that woman immediately,or-"
"Or what?" I asked, a cold smile playing at my lips.
"That kind of woman isn't worthy of you," he stated flatly. "I'll take action if necessary."

"You're welcome to try," I replied, my voice deliberately light.

He paused, then demanded. "Bring her to the manor. Tonight."

I ended the call without another word, sliding the phone back into my pocket. When I looked up, Summer was watching me intently.

"What's wrong?" she asked, concern etched across her face. "Is it something with Stark Group? Or the family?"

"Nothing important," I dismissed, though my mind was already calculating the implications. William had seen Summer, and the resemblance to Lyanna had obviously triggered him.

Turning to Meave, I explained, "I need to head to the Stark manor.Something's come up."

Meave, perceptive as always, nodded understandingly. "I'm feeling quite tired anyway. I should rest."

"I'll have James drive you both back to the Hampfons," I said,already reaching for my phone.

"That's not necessary," Summer interjected. "You handle your business,Brandon. I can take care of Aunt Meave."




Storm clouds gathered over the Stark manor as I pulled up the long driveway,the mansion's silhouette looming against the darkening sky. The weather matched the atmosphere I was about to walk into-heavy with tension and the promise of conflict.
The butler opened the door before I could even knock.
"Alone, sir?" he asked, his expression carefully neutral.

I ignored the question, stepping past him into the grand foyer. The house felt unnaturally quiet, the kind of silence that precedes an explosion.

In the main sitting room, my family waited like judges ata tribunal-William in his usual armchair by the fireplace, my father Robert standing by the window, Uncle Gavin seated near the door, and my sister Sarah perched uncomfortably on the edge of a sofa.

William's face darkened when he saw me enter alone. "Where is she?" he demanded.

"Who?" I asked innocently, though we both knew exactly who he meant.

Sarah caught my eye, a subtle warning in her gaze that I acknowledged with the barest glance.

"Don't play dumb with me," William snapped, his knuckles white where they gripped his cane. "The staff saw her in your car. That woman."

I settled into a chair opposite him, deliberately relaxed. "If you already know,why bother asking me?"

"End it," William ordered flatly. "Break things off with her immediately.I've told you before-Lyanna York is out of the question, and so is this one."

I couldn't help but smile, So that was it--he thought I was with Summer because she reminded me of Lyanna. The irony was almost amusing.

"After thirty years as your grandson," I said quietly, "you still don't understand what I want."
William's face flushed with anger. "Don't lecture me, boy."

"Whether she resembles Lyanna or not is irrelevant," I continued calmly. "She's mine. And for the record, she's nothing like Lyanna. She's better."
"Better?" William scoffed. "That Summer Taylor girl? With her background? She's nowhere near your league, Brandon."

"You're right," I agreed, surprising him. "I'm not worthy of her."

I stood up slowly, sliding one hand into my pocket as I delivered the blow I knew would detonate the situation beyond repair.

"She's my wife."

William froze, then slowly rose to his feet. "What did you just say?"

"You heard me correctly," I stated flatly. "Summer and I are already married. So your demand that I break up with her is impossible to fulfill."

"You ungrateful-" William's face contorted with rage as he raised his cane,only to have my father intercept it before it could strike me.

"Did you know about this?" William turned his fury on Robert, who stood calmly between us.

"I knew of her," my father admitted carefully. "But not about the marriage.



He turned to me, his expression unreadable. "Brandon, is this some misguided attempt to replace Lyanna? Because if so-"

A cold laugh escaped me. "Think whatever you want. Whether you believe me or accept Summer makes no difference. She is my wife-Mrs.Stark-and will remain so for the rest of our lives." I took a step closer to William,my voice dropping dangerously. "If anyone tries to harm her in any way,they'll answer directly to me."
The challenge hung in the air between us, clear and unmistakable. I'd drawn my line in the sand. Summer was non-negotiable-even to the mighty William Stark.
###Chapter 284: The Stark Family Will Never Accept Her!

Brandon's POV

"You ungrateful boy!" William's face contorted with rage as he struggled to his feet, leaning heavily on his cane. "After everything I've done for you-everything I've built-this is how you repay me?"

I stared at my grandfather, this once-towering figure of Wall Street now reduced to an angry old man. The room felt smaller somehow, the air heavy with decades of unspoken resentments and expectations.

"I've given you everything," he continued, voice shaking. "Made you the heir to an empire! And you throw it back in my face for some... some nobody?"

"Are you finished?" I asked quietly, my calm tone a stark contrast to his fury.
William's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Don't you dare take that tone with me. I can strip you of everything-your position, your inheritance, your name."

"Go ahead."

My simple response seemed to catch him off guard. He blinked,momentarily speechless.

"I don't need the Stark name to succeed," I continued, looking down at the man who had once seemed so formidable. "I never have."

William slammed his cane against the hardwood floor, the crack echoing through the silent room. "The Stark family will never accept her. Never!Do you understand me? That woman will never be acknowledged by this family!"
I froze for juast a moment, something cold and sharp twisting in my chest.Then I straightened my back, shoulders squared.

"I don't recall asking for your acceptance," I replied coldly. "Summer is my wife. Whether you acknowledge her or not changes nothing."

Without waiting for a response, I turned and walked toward the door,feeling the weight of four pairs of eyes on my back.

"If you walk out that door," William called after me, "don't bother coming back!"


I didn't break stride, didn't even look back as I pulled the heavy oak door shut behind me.




"Brandon, wait!"

I was halfway to my car when Sarah's voice called out from the mansion.She hurried down the steps, her face pinched with worry as she caught up to me.

"What the hell was that?" she demanded, positioning herself between me and my car door. "How could you speak to Grandlfather that way?"

I stared at her impassively. "Move aside,Sarah."

"No." She crossed her arms, a hint of our shared stubborn streak showing through. "You can't just drop a bomb like that and walk away. Do you have any idea what you've done?"
"I told the truth. Nothing more."

"Father called me back specifically for this meeting," she said,her voice dropping to a whisper. "But I didn't say anything about what you told me before,I swear."
"I know."

Her eyes searched mine. "Is this really worth it? You're throwing away everything-your birthright,your future-for her? For Summer?"

"My company is worth billions," I replied flatly. "My position in the market is secure. Tell me exactly what I'm losing here, Sarah."

She hesitated. "Family support. Connections. A woman who could actually help you-"

"Help me?" I cut her off with a cold laugh. "Only weak men need women to advance their careers."

Sarah flinched as if I'd slapped her.

"Let me be perfectly clear," I continued. "If you stand with me,I welcome it. If you stand with the family, I won't hold it against you. But I'll walk this path alone if necessary, and I won't interfere in your affairs any longer.11


The color drained from her face. "We're family," she whispered. "Why are you doing this to us?"

"Tell Grandfather I don't care about being his heir," I said, gently moving her aside. "If he wants to replace me, he's welcome to try."
Her expression turned fearful. "Brandon, you can't mean that. Only you can-"

"Then he has a problem, doesn't he?" I opened the car door. "Goodbye,Sarah."

As I drove away, I caught a glimpse of her in my rearview mirror.standing alone on the vast driveway, suddenly looking very small against the looming Stark mansion.
The moment I left the Stark estate. I could feel the pressure building behind my eyes-not tears, but pure, focused rage. My knuckles turned white against the steering wheel as I drove, mind racing with contingency plans.


My phone rang. Gavin. I considered ignoring it but decided against it.

"How's Meave?" he asked without preamble.

"She's at the Hamptons estate," I replied curtly. "June is with her."

There was a pause. "Brandon, what you said today was extreme.You know Grandfather means well. He doesn't know Summer,that's all. He's just concerned."

"Is that why you're calling?"

Gavin sighed audibly. "Tell me honestly-is there any connection between Summer and Lyanna York?"

My jaw clenched involuntarily. "This again? No. There isn't."

"Look, we both know why William and your father were so set on Lyanna back then. What happened three years ago... it changed everything.They'll never accept Lyanna now. I just need to know if you're using Summer as some kind of replacement."

"You're testing my patience, Gavin."

"Just answer me, Brandon. Is Summer a substitute for Lyanna?"

"No." My voice was ice. "I've only ever wanted June. There's never been anyone else."
"Alright," Gavin relented. "Just making sure your feelings for Summer have
nothing to do with Lyanna."

"Are we done here?" I asked coldly. "Or would you like to continue questioning my judgment?"

"I'm on your side, Brandon," Gavin reminded me softly before hanging up.

I immediately dialed James Wilson.

"Sir?"

"Where's my wife?" I demanded.

"I've escorted Mrs. Stark and Mrs. Meave back to the Hamptons estate as instructed," he reported efficiently. "We were followed by what appears to be Stark family security for most of the journey."

I nodded, unsurprised. "They'll be looking into Summer's background soon. Make the necessary alterations to her records."

"Already in progress,sir."

"And Lyanna York-any updates?"

James hesitated. "Our last intelligence placed her in Mexico, sir. Still with the same companion."

"That's not good enough," I said sharply. "I need concrete information.James.Not speculation."

"Understood, sir. I'll intensify our efforts immediately."

As I ended the call, my thoughts returned to Summer. I'd known this day would come eventually-the day when my family discovered our marriage and tried to tear it apart. What I hadn't anticipated was how utterly unmoved I'd feel by their threats.
###Chapter 285: Meeting Jane Sinclair

Summer's POV

I was in the middle of telling Meave about one of my college pranks when we heard the front door open. Brandon appeared in the doorway, his tall frame silhouetted against the evening light. Even from across the room,I could sense the tension radiating from him, though his expression remained carefully controlled.

"Well, look who's back," Meave said warmly.

My face instantly brightened. "Brandon, you're home!" I called out, my eyes crinkling with genuine happiness.

The rigid lines of his body visibly softened as our eyes met. "Yeah," he replied, his voice lightening as he stepped into the room.

"What were you two chatting about? You look so happy," he asked.

I bounced up, taking his coat. "We were talking about you,actually!"I teased, handing him his slippers."Meave's been singing your praises non-stop. Going on and on about how wonderful you are. I'm starting to get jealous!"

Brandon ruffled my hair. "You're something else. Have you thought about dinner?"

"Way ahead of you," I replied proudly. "James drove us to the market earlier. I picked up fresh ingredients-was just waiting for you to get back so I could start cooking!"

"Look at you, being all domestic," he teased, reaching to pinch my nose.

I swatted his hand away. "Stop it! Meave's right here! Behave yourself!" I scolded, though I couldn't keep the smile from my voice. "Why don't you
keep Meave company while I put your coat away and get dinner started?"

As I headed for the stairs, something about their sudden silence made me pause at the landing, just out of sight but within earshot.

"Meave." Brandon's voice had lost all its warmth, turning back to steel.

"The old man knows, doesn't he?" Meave asked quietly.

A pause. "Nothing ever gets past you, does it?"

My breath caught. William Stark knew about us?

"What are you going to do?" Meave asked,concerned.

"Nothing," Brandon replied firmly. "June is my wife. That's all there is to it. Whether the Stark family acknowledges her or not means nothing to me.


My heart swelled at his unwavering stance, even as anxiety curled in my stomach.

"Are you planning to tell Summer?"

"She doesn't need to know," Brandon stated flatly. "These matters don't concern her."

I bit my lip, conflicted emotions churning inside me. Part of me wanted to rush down and demand to know everything, but another part understood why Brandon wanted to shield me.

"Remember this," Meave said seriously. "Marriage means sharing burdens.Don't keep secrets from her. Trust is the foundation of everything."
"I know," Brandon replied, his tone softening slightly.

I continued upstairs, hanging his coat carefully. Brandon was protecting
me-that much was clear. While I appreciated it, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being kept in the dark about something important.

When I returned downstairs, I found only Meave in the living room.

"Where's Brandon?" I asked.

"Kitchen," Meave replied, patting the space beside her. "Come sit with me!"

"But I was supposed to cook tonight," I protested.

"Let him handle it," Meave insisted.

I peeked into the kitchen where Brandon stood washing vegetables, an apron over his expensive shirt. He looked so adorably domestic I couldn't help but grin.

"Brandon Stark in an apron!" I giggled, pulling out my phone. "This is too good to pass up. Strike a pose-this is definitely becoming my new lock screen!"

He rolled his eyes but didn't object as I snapped several photos.

I showed Meave the pictures. "Look how cute he is! Have you ever seen Brandon like this boefore?"
Meave studied the images with a warm smile. "He looks happier than I've ever seen him. The way he looks at you.., there's no pretending that kind of love." She glanced at me. "Some people worry he sees you as a replacement for someone else, but that's impossible. It's clear as day-he loves*you*,Summer."

My cheeks flushed. "Really?"

"Absolutely," Meave affirmed. "And you capture him in a way no one else could."
The next day. I was leaving Scarlett's coffee shop when a black SUV pulled up beside me. A man in a dark suit stepped out.

"Ms. Taylor, our lady would like a word with you."

I frowned. "Your lady?"

The rear window lowered,revealing Jane Sinclair's pale, elegant face.

"Mrs. Stark," I acknowledged, keeping my voice even.

Her lips curved into something that wasn't quite a smile. "No need to play innocent with me."

"What can I do for you?"

"Is it true?" she demanded. "You and Brandon-you're mnarried?"

After a moment's hesitation, I nodded. "Yes, we are."

Her face hardened. "Get in the car."

Every instinct screamed this was a bad idea, but I knew avoiding this confrontation would only delay the inevitable. "Alright."
The interior smelled of expensive leather and subtle perfume. Jane sat rigidly across from me, scanning me head to toe with undisguised disdain.The silence between us was heavy with unspoken judgments.
The car pulled up to an upscale restaurant. We were led to a private dining room, isolated from other patrons.
"Here," she said coldly,pushing a menu toward me.

I pushed it back. "I'll have whatever you're having. I'm not picky."
"Of course you're not," she retorted with a bitter laugh. "You only pick the very best-like my son."

I met her gaze directly. "I assume you asked to meet because of my marriage to Brandon?"


Jane slammed the menu down, all pretense of civility evaporating. "You are not suitable for Brandon. Leave him. Immediately."

"Nothing to say?" she challenged when I remained silent.

"Whether we're suitable for each other is something only Brandon and I can determine, don't you think?"

Jane's perfectly manicured nails drummed against the table. "Someone like you could never be good enough for Brandon. Not your background, not your status-nothing about you helps him. You're only dragging him down! Don't pretend you want anything but his money and position!"

I felt a flicker of genuine amusement at how wildly she'd misjudged me."You've misunderstood. I care about Brandon himself-the man, not his assets. He treats me well, and I care for him. It's actually quite simple and has nothing to do with money,power,or status."

Jane's laugh was sharp and cutting. "Please! I've seen countless women like you. All claiming it's not about the money. If that's true, why not find yourself some penniless nobody instead?"

Something cold settled in my chest. I let my smile fade, meeting her hostility with my own growing chill.
"So in your view," I said quietly, "I should only pursue poor men to prove my love is genuine? Interesting standard. May I ask why you didn't follow that advice yourself? The Sinclairs are quite wealthy, aren't they? You could have easily supported a man with no fortune. Why specifically target one of New York's oldest and most powerful families like the Starks?"
###Chapter 286: Truth That Cut Deep

Summer's POV

Jane Sinclair's perfectly manicured nails drummed against the mahogany table as her eyes narrowed into dangerous slits. My comment about her marriage to the wealthy Sinclair family had clearly struck a nerve.

"You..." she spat, her voice trembling with rage. "Such a sharp tongue!You think speaking to me this way puts us on equal footing?"

I kept my expression neutral, refusing to be intimidated. "That wasn't my intention at all! Actually, I'd prefer if you complimented my eloquence.Brandon thinks I'm quite articulate, you know."

Her palm slammed against the table, sending crystal glasses rattling. "How dare you! So you're absolutely refusing to leave Brandon?"

"I have no reason to leave my husband," I replied firmly, meeting her gaze without flinching. "Honestly, I'm confused about why you asked me here today. Most mothers want their children to be happy, yet here you are,desperately trying to destroy your son's marriage. It's... fascinating,really."
Jane leaned forward, her designer jacket pulling taut åcross her shoulders."Of course I want himto be happy. Just not with *you*."

"Why?" I asked, genuinely puzzled. "I don't believe I've ever offended you,SO-"

"It's that face of yours!" she cut in, her voice rising. "Do you really think Brandon chose you for who you are? It's nothing but your face! You're nothing more than a substi-"

The door to our private dining room suddenly burst open with such force that both of us jumped. Brandon stood in the doorway, his expression dark as a gathering storm. The temperature in the room seemed to drop
several degrees at once.

"Γ'm what?" I asked Jane quickly, desperate to hear the rest of her sentence.

Brandon's voice cut through the tension like a blade.

Jane's face drained of color. "Bran... Brandon, what are you doing here?"

Brandon strode into the room, each step dleliberate and controlled. He positioned himself beside my chair, one hand resting protectively on my shoulder. The weight of it was comforting, anchoring me amidst the chaos.

"Mrs. Sinclair invites my wife to luanch without explanation. I'd like to know why," his voice dangerously soft.

Jane straightened, attempting to regain her composure. "Brandon,I'm your mother. You got married-don't I have a right to meet my daughter-in-law?"


"Mother?" A cold smile played on Brandon's lips. "I don't have a mother."

Those words hung in the air like shards of ice. Jane visibly flinched, her body swaying slighly as though she'd been physically struck.
"You..." Her voice cracked. "Brandon, I know you hate me,but you can't change the fact that you're my son."
"Blood can't be changed," Brandon agreed, his tone flat. "But everything else can."

Jane's hand flew to her throat. "Brandon!" She stumbled backward.gripping the edge of the table for support. "Brandon, you'd oppose the entire Stark family-and the Sinclairs-for this... this woman? Do you even realize what you're doing? Is she worth it? You're theheir to one of Wall Street's most powerful financial dynasties!"
"Whether she's worth it is my concern alone," Brandon replied coldly.
ape200.eep
Brandon's fingers tightened slightly on my shoulder. "Your brother Jeffrey just left New York. Seems he forgot to take you with him."

"I am a Stark by marriage," Jane insisted, her chin lifting. "I am your father's wife!"

"How convenient that you remember that now." Brandon's voice dripped with sarcasm. "Consider this my final warning: if you approach my wife again. I'll make sure you regret."

Brandon took my hand, preparing to lead me out. My heart was racing,trying to process everything happening around me.

"Fine! You've made your point!" A strange look of realization dawned on Jane's face. "So you've been married to this woman all along. And those rumors about you and Victoria that were all over New York-you orchestrated that yourself, didn't you? To divert attention while we were busy dealing with Victoria?"

Brandon said nothing, but his silence was confirmation enough.I watched Jane's expression shift as she pieced together the truth.

"So Elle..." Jane's voice trembled. "That's your doing too?"

Brandon released my hand, the sudden absence of his touch making me anxious.

"Brandon, your mother is-" I started, concerned by the pallor of Jane's face.

Brandon gently motioned for me to step aside. I could feel Jane's hatred intensifying as she glared at me.
"The Sinclair family has been declining under Jeffrey's management for years," Brandon said coldly. "Perhaps it needs new ownership."
eep
Jane's eyes widened in horror. "What are you planníng? Leave the Sinclairs alone-they're innocent in this!"

"Innocent?" Brandon's laugh was chilling. "The Sinclairs are the furthest thing from innocent. Don't think I was too youing to understand what was happening. My father may have been soft-hearted because he cared for you,but I won't show the same mercy. You trampled his feelings while trying to seize everything the Starks had. The Sinclairs were too ambitious for their own good."

Brandon took a step closer to Jane, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Ask your dear brother what he did to you thirty-five years ago.My father treated you with nothing but kindness, yet you helped outsiders hurt him. Ask Jeffrey what he did to my father twenty-five years ago. Or what he did to Elle three years ago."
Jane stumbled backward. "That's impossible!"

"You are smart enough to understand I'm not speaking idly," Brandon continued. "If you want answers, I'd be happy to show you the evidence."
"No," Jane shook her head frantically. "No, I don't want to see anything!"

She turned to me, her face twisted with bitterness. "Well, I've raised quite a son, haven't I? Willing to treat his own mother this way for an outsider.For this woman, you'd disregard blood ties completely? Does it make you happy to reopen my wounds?"

"Weren't you ruthless and self-serving when you used your wounds to hurt my father all these years?" Brandon countered.
Jane looked genuinely shocked. "You... is this really how you've seen me all these years? Is this who I am in your eyes?"
"When I was six," Brandon said calmly, "I saw you drugging my father's drink. then sending a woman to his bed. That moment L understoodun
d do anything to achieve your goals. Wasn't that the truth?
###Chapter 287: Stark Family Secrets

Summer's POV

I stood frozen. watching the exchange between Brandon and his mother with my mouth slightly open. What Jane had just revealed, and what Brandon was saying in response... it was changing everything I thought I knew about the Stark family.

"No, Brandon, listen to your mother, I only did what I did because-" Jane's voice trembled as she tried to explain.

"Because you wanted to divorce my father?" Brandon cut her off, his voice sharp as steel. "And then break up Uncle Gavin's marriage? Separate Gavin and Meave so you could marry my uncle instead?"

Jane's face drained of color. "I... I..."

"You believe my father forced himself on you," Brandon continued, each word precise and cutting. "But do you know who drugged my father thirty-five years ago?"

I felt my heart drop. The scandal he was describing was shocking enough,but the cold calculation in Brandon's voice was even more chilling. This wasn't just family drama--this was something far deeper and darker.
"I told you before," Brandon said, his voice dangerously quiet, "staying with the Sinclairs would have been your best option. I am your son, after all-I inherited your ruthlessness."
He took my hand, his grip firm but not painful. "We're done here."

As Brandon led me out, my mind was reeling. The man beside me wasn't the cold, distant person others thought they knew. What I'd just witnessed was more complex-a man deeply wounded by family betrayals, fighting to protect what was his.
Once we were safely in Brandon's car. he helped me with my seatbelt before sliding into the driver's seat. Before he could start the engine, I placed my hand over his.

"Hey," I said softly.

The hardness in his expression melted slightly as he looked at me. "Did I scare you?"

I shook my head. "No. I'm just... processing."

Brandon sighed, running his hand through his hair. "I didn't want you to see that side of me."

"The side that cares enough to protect me?" I asked with a small smile.

He looked at me with surprise, then something in his eyes softened.

I traced my finger along the back of his hand,hesitating before asking,"What about Alice? Your sister... you mentioned her before."

Brandon's jaw tightened. "Stark family dynamics are complicated. Don't trust anyone I haven't specifically vouched for. Alice was the child born to that college student I mentioned."

"What happened to her? The college student, I mean."

Brandon's eyes darkened. "Shecame from a poor family. After what happened, she lost her job and went back home. Her family wasn't supportive, and she struggled to raise the baby alone. Eventually, she approached the Stark family, hoping they would at least acknowledge her child."

"And your father?" I asked carefully. "What did he want to do?"
"He wanted to divorce my mother. Free her. It was all arranged, but at the last minute, she changed her mind and backed out."

I frowned. "Why would she do that if she wanted to be with your uncle?"

"You're forgetting about the Sinclair family behind her," Brandon explained."They would never allow the divorce. Do you understand what that would mean? The Sinclairs would lose their connection to the Stark family-and their foothold on Wall Street. My uncle Jeffrey isn't stupid."

"So what happened to Alice?"

Brandon's expression turned distant. "My mother refused to divorce my father, but she also refused to let the Stark family acknowledge Alice. She wouldn't even let Alice's mother set foot in New York. Eventually, she took her dowry and returnedI to Washington. She never came back."

I stared at him, finally understanding the depth of his resentment. "That's why you're so protective of Alice. You feel guilty about what happened to her."


Brandon didn't respond, but I saw his eyes darken.

"Brandon," I said gently, "that's all in the past. You don't need to carry it with you. You're both adults now, capable of conrolling your own destinies-"

"I know," he interrupted. "You think I'm still affected by all this? I'm not.
I just refuse to let anyone else control my fate. My life is my own."

"What about Gavin and Meave?" I asked.

"They truly love each other. They were always meant to be together." His voice softened. "Don't worry, I know where my loyalties lie."
Brandon glanced at me. "The real victims weren't me. Despite everything.I'
m still a Stark, the future heir to the family fortune. The ones who truly suffered were my sister and Alice."

"Your sister? Sarah?" I asked, surprised.

"Yes. My mother transferred all her anger onto Sarah. That's why Sarah dislikes my mother even more than I do."

Brandon reached for my hand. "I'm telling you all this not to upset you,but because I want to share everything with you-both good and bad.I don't want secrets between us."

I squeezed his hand, then suddenly remembered something. "Wait, how did you know I was here with your mother?"

"Did you forget I have people watching over you?" he replied with a slight smile.

"Your security team told you? But you got here so fast! What,do you fly?"

Brandon laughed. "Something like that. I can't stand the thought of you being hurt, so I'll always come running whenever you need me."
"You're amazing," I said, feeling a rush of affection. "Don't worry about me,though. I can take care of myself. I won't let anyone push me around anymore,"


"Really?" Brandon raised an eyebrow, amusement dancing in his eyes."Since the day I met you, when have you ever not caused me worry?"
I felt my cheeks flush. "That was before! I'm talking about from now on.Nobody's going to mess with me again."
"Alright," he said, his smile widening. "I'll believe you just this once."
Back at the Hamptons estate, Brandon immediately disappeared into his study while I busied myself in the kitchen. As I chopped vegetables,my mind kept replaying the day's events.

The Stark<family secrets. Brandon's childhood. The scandal with Alice's mother. It was all so overwhelming. And something about Jane's hostility toward me still felt strange-almost personal in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on.

"Summer?" Meave's voice startled me from my thoughts.

I looked up to find her watching me from the doorway,concern etched on her face.

"You've seemed distracted since you and Brandon returned," she said."Did something happen?"

I hesitated, setting down my knife. "Can I ask you something?"

Meave nodded, her eyes gentle. "About Brandon? Or the Stark family?"

"Brandon's mother found me today," I said."Jane Sinclair."

Meave's expression hardened slightly. "Let me guess-she discovered your relationship with Brandon and decided to cause trouble?"

"How did you know?" I asked, surprised.

"It's not clairvoyance, dear," Meave replied with a sad smile. "It's just who she is. Whatever she said to you, don't take it to heart. Gavin and I both approve of your relationship with Brandon."
I bit my lip, still troubled. "That's just it. She didn't know me before today.but she seemed to hate me instantly. Like, really hate me. It was weird..."
Meave studied my face for a long moment. something unreadable flickering in her expression.
"She's like that with everyone," she finally said, though something in her voice made me wonder if she was holding back. "Especially anyone close to Brandon or Gavin."


I nodded, but couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to the story-a missing piece I couldn't quite grasp.
###Chapter 288: Meeting William

Summer's POV

The Stark Group lobby buzzed with post-holiday energy as I struggled with a stack of financial reports that had been haunting me since before New Year's. My brain felt foggy from the brutal transition back to work life.and these investment projections weren't making it any easier.

I nearly collided with two men in identical black suits and sunglasses who stepped directly into my path.

"Ms. Taylor?" The taller one's voice was deep and formal.

"Yes, that's me."

"Mr. Stark would like to see you. Please come with us."

I blinked. "Mr. Stark? Who exactly-"

"Our employer requests your presence immediately."

A chill ran through me as I connected the dots. "William Stark, right?"

The subtle twitch at the corner of his mouth confirmed my guess.


"Could I drop these files off upstairs first? They're important and-"

"It's William Stark who wishes to see you," he cut in firmly,"since you're aware, then you understand the urgency. Whatever you're doing must wait.11


His tone made me bristle. Brandon could be demanding,but at least he had some semblance of social grace.
"You need to let me call my boss," I insisted. "I can't just disappear with critical financial reports. People are waiting for these."
The men exchanged annoyed glances just as Leo Schmidt walked through the revolving doors.


I jumped at the opportunity. "Leol Thank God you're here. I have those analysis reports you needed."

Leo looked confused. "The analysis? I thought you weren't finishing those until this afternoon?"


I shot him a meaningful look while handing over the papers. "Brandon wanted these right away, but I need to step out. Could you make sure he gets them when they're ready?"

As I passed him the files, I gave his hand a firm squeeze. "Make *sure*Brandon knows about this."

Leo's eyes flickered to the men in suits, understanding dawning."Of course. I'll personally see that Brandon gets them. Go handle whatever you need to-we'll touch base by phone."

"Thank you," I said, then turned to the men. "Alright, where exactly is William Stark waiting?"

They didn't answer, just gestured toward a sleek black car at the curb.




The silence in the car was deafening as we drove away from the city.I reached for my phone in my purse.
"I wouldn't do that," the man in the passenger seat warned.

I raised an eyebrow. "Seriously? I can't even check my phone? William Stark invited me for a conversation, not a kidnapping."
"We were instructed--"
"Relax," I cut him off. "I'm just texting a friend, not Brandon. It's not like we're doing anything illegal here."

"I suggest you cooperate, Ms. Taylor."

I pretended to comply, dropping my phone back into my purse while discretely pressing Brandon's number. To mask any sounds, I launched into cheerful chatter.


"So how long have you guys worked for William Stark? Must be interesting,right? The Stark family has such a fascinating history on Wall Street..."

I kept talking, ignoring their stony silence. For once, my nervous rambling was useful.




We arrived at an elegant beachfront property. The house was smaller than Brandon's estate but exuded old money from every carefully maintained inch.

"Mr. Stark is upstairs," one of the men informed me. "Wait here."

"Should I go up?" I asked.

"You'll wait here," he replied firmly.

My throat felt parched after all my nervous chattering. "Couald I at least get some water? I didn't have a chance to drink anything at the office, and I'm seriously thirsty."

One man went for water while the other headed upstairs. When he returned,he handed me the glass with a warning. "Don't try anything."
"What exactly could I try? I'm just sitting here waiting for an elderly gentleman."
Half an hour later, William Stark finally descended the stairs, clutching an ornate cane. Despite his age, there was no mistaking the commanding presence that had ruled Wall Street for decades.

I rose, offering a respectful smile. "Mr. Stark!"

William settled into a chair opposite me, studying me with piercing eyes reminiscent of Brandon's. "Who else is in your family, Ms. Taylor?"

I recognized the question for what it was-confirmation of information he'd already gathered. "My parents are still alive, as are both my grandfathers.I also have an older sister, Victoria."

"Is that so? I've heard your relationship with your family is rather...strained."

"That's what you've heard," I replied evenly. "But rumors can be misleading. For instance, I recently heard that the Stark family is divided about Brandon's positionas heir."

His eyebrows shot up at my boldness. After a moment, he pushed himself to his feet.

"Summer, let's not waste time. I don't care if you'vé married Brandon or not. I will never accept you into the Stark family. You will never be acknowledged as a Stark."

I straightened my shoulders, meeting his gaze directly. "Brandon and I married half a year ago. He proposed to me, not the other way around.We entered this marriage for the long haul, and I have no intention of leaving Brandon. I won't divorce him unless he stops loving me and ends things himself. Nothing you or anyone else does will separate us."
William's knuckles whitened around his cane. "Such audacity! You married Brandon for the Stark family name, obviously. Everyone in New York wants to be connected to the Starks. As long as I refuse to
acknowledge you, you'll never be a true Stark-and Brandon will never inherit the family business!"

"Is that a threat?" I asked quietly. "You'd deny Brandon his birthright because of me?"

He leaned forward. "What's the matter? Disappointed that your meal ticket might lose his fortune?"


To his visible surprise, I laughed-not politely, but genuinely. "Mr. Stark.you actually think I'm with Brandon for the Stark family name?"

"Aren't you?"

I shook my head, still smiling. "I don't need to explain my feelings to you.I'm laughing because you clearly don't know your grandson at all. You think Brandon would be nothing without the Stark family? Yes, Stark Group is a Wall Street powerhouse, impressive to outsiders. But without Brandon, the Stark Group would be just another financial institution."

William's face flushed with anger. "What did you just say? Say that again!"

"Mr. Stark, I don't think you know why you brought me here. If you want me to leave Brandon, it's simple: have Brandon come tell me himself. If he wants to end things and has a reasonable explanation, I'll walk away. But you clearly don't understand your grandson's character if you thought summoning me behind his back would-"

We were interrupted by the unmistakable sound of a car engine shutting off outside.
I couldn't help the small, triumphant smile that crept across my face."Sounds like you missed your window of opportunity to intimidate me. Mr.Stark."
###Chapter 289: Summer Is My Sister

Summer's POV

William Stark stared at me like I'd grown a second head.

"You... you called Brandon?" His voice cracked with surprise, his composure slipping.

I couldn't help but feel satisfied. For someone who'd orchestrated this kidnapping, he seemed weirdly shocked that I'd contacted my husband.

"Why are you so surprised?" I raised an eyebrow. "When you summoned me here, you must have known Brandon would come!"

The alarm in William's eyes told me everything. He genuinely hadn't expected me to reach out to Brandon.

"Though Brandon right now is probably-"

The door burst open with a resounding CRACK, slamming against the wall hard enough to make nearby artwork rattle.

Dr. Sean Sullivan stood in the doorway, looking ridiculously casual for someone who'd just kicked in a door worth more than most people's rent.His hands were tucked into his jacket pockets, wearing that carefree smile that always drove Brandon crazy.

"Hey, there," he called cheerfully.

"Sean!" I couldn't hide my relief at seeing him.

Sean stepped into the room, glancing at the damaged door."I hope Mr.Stark won't hold this door against me!"
William rose from his chair, his face a mask of fury. "Sean Sullivan! What are you doing here?"
"Oh, nothing much." Sean shrugged. "Brandon had some busíness to attend to, so he asked me to look after his wife. Said there've been some unsavory characters trying to abduct her lately." He winked at me. "Isn't that right. Summer?"

"This is what-the third time he's had to rescue me?" I fixed William with a pointed look. "Though this time might be a wasted trip. Brandon's grandfather certainly wouldn't harm me, would you, Mr.Stark?"

William scoffed coldly.

"So Mr. Stark, you're saying I absolutely must leave Brandon?"

"Summer, you're not right for Brandon. If you're willing to leave him,whatever amount you want..."

"I want ten million dollars," I cut him off bluntly. "Sir, ten million-are you willing to pay that?"

William's jaw dropped before his face flushed with anger. "You... you're quite presumptuous. Ten million? Do you think you're worth that price?"
"Seems like you're unwilling to pay." I shrugged. "Or perhaps you think Brandon isn't worth ten million?"
"Whether Brandon is worth it or not, I would never give you anything!"

"You think I'd care about that?" I laughed, though inside I was seething. "Compared to Brandon, ten million is nothing.I know which matters more."
I took a deep breath, looking William straight in the eye. "Mr.Stark, I love Brandon for who he is. Even if he lost everything tomorrow, I wouldn't leave him. Unless one day he stops loving me, or I stop loving him.nobody can separate us-not even you!"
I turned to Sean. "Dr. Sean, could you please take me back?"
"My car's right outside." he confirmed.

"Sullivan!" William's voice cut through the room. "Think carefully about this. Are you opposing the Stark family? Brandon still doesn't understand his responsibilities. Are you helping him make mistakes?"

Sean looked perplexed. "I don't follow. Mr. Stark. Brandon makes critical decisions in the financial world every day-I hardly think he's confused.Besides, I'm just helping Brandon by taking his wife home!"

"You... you really insist on being insolent?"

"What exactly do you plan to do?" Sean laughed. "Keep my sister-in-law here? I gather you've run out of options?"

Sean stepped forward. "The Stark family may be powerful on Wall Street,but don't underestimate the Sullivans. I may not like getting involved in business matters, but that doesn't mean our family lacks influence."

He paused. "You refuse to accept Summer because you think her background isn't worthy? Don't you know that Summer is actually part of the Sullivan family?"

William's eyes widened. "What did you say?"

"In our Sullivan family, we have plenty of men but few women," Sean continued,straight-faced."My father's branch has only me. My mother wanted a daughter but was too frail for another child. So she adopted Summer as her goddaughter."
I nearly did a double-take but kept my face neutral. What was he doing?

"Since you don't like my sister, I'll take her home," Sean declared. "You're making my mother sad by keeping her daughter away!"
"You can leave, but this woman stays! Don't fool an old man with a few
words. I will never allow her to be with Brandon."

"Is that so?"

The cold voice made us all turn. Brandon stood in the doorway,his expression glacial.

"Brandon!" My heart leapt at the sight of him.

Brandon surveyed the room. "Disable them," he commanded.

James and Desmond moved efficiently. Within seconds, William's security team was neutralized.

Brandon crossed to me, his expression softening. "Are you alright?"

"I'm fine," I assured him. "They didn't hurt me. How did you get here?"

He tapped my nose. "Didn't you call me?"

"You two, if you're going to be all lovey-dovey, change venues," Sean interrupted. "I came all this way to help."
"Thanks to Dr. Sean for coming so quickly!" I smiled.

"Thanks!" Brandon nodded to Sean, then turned to me. "Stay close to Sean.”


William had gone pale. "What are you doing here?!"

"Why not?" Brandon's smile was cold. "Grandfather, this tactic isn't clever.Using work to detain me was unwise. If you wanted to meet June, you could have notified me."
His voice remained calm, but I heard the steel beneath it. "Taking my wife from the company in broad daylight-since you've done so without my knowledge, I naturally can't ignore it."
"Brandon, do you oppose me for this woman?" William's voice shook. "Do you know what she said-"

"What she said isn't important," Brandon cut him off. "Next time you want to meet June, inform me. Otherwise, I might think someone wishes to harm her. As you've witnessed before, anyone who touches what's mine will pay the price."




Back at the Hamptons estate, I served tea to Brandon and Sean.

"Thank you for today, Dr. Sean," I said.

"What's there to thank between us?" Sean raised an eyebrow. "Right,sis?"

I laughed. "Dr. Sean, stop joking. I know you were just helping me out!"

"Who says I was just helping you out?" Sean frowned. "That's ungrateful.Besides, I never take back my word." He turned to Brandon. "Isn't that right?"

Brandon eyed him suspiciously. "You're really taking advantage of this situation."

"What are you talking about? I'mn just looking out for my sister!" Sean continued innocently. "Her position in the Taylor family is awkward, and it s uncomfortable in your Stark family too, But in our Sullivan family, it's different. Even if your grandfather doesn't like her, if she's one of us, he wouldn't dare harm her!"
###Chapter 290: It's Time

Summer's POV

Days went on and on.

Night had fallen over the Hamptons estate as I made my way upstairs,my footsteps echoing softly against the polished hardwood. I paused outside Brandon's study, hearing his low voice through the door. He was on a call-again. Lately, it seemed like he was constantly on the phone,handling one crisis after another.

I hesitated, not wanting to interrupt, but I really needed to talk to him about something I'd been putting off. Taking a deep breath,I knocked softly and pushed the door open.

Brandon was standing by the window, phone pressed to his ear,silhouetted against the darkness outsidde. He glanced over his shoulder, his stern expression softening slightly when he saw me. He beckoned me with a quick gesture of his hand.

"Come here," he mouthed silently.

I crossed the room and settled into one of the leather chairs, watching as he wrapped up his call. Something about work, as usual. Finally, he set the phone down and turned to face me.

"Looking for me?" he asked, his voice warm despite the lingering tension in his shoulders.
"Yeah," I admitted, suddenly nervous about what I was about to ask."There's actually something I've been meaning to bring up. I've been so busy lately that it almost slipped my mind, but my father-I mean,Richard-his birthday is coming up in a couple of days."
Brandon raised an eyebrow, waiting for me to continue.
"I know he's not my real father," I rushed on, fidgeting with the hemn of my sweater. "But I still have the Taylor name, and Grandpa George has always been good to me. If I don't show up, it would seem... I don't know,ungrateful? Disrespectful?"

Brandon nodded thoughtfully."So?"

I stood up and walked over to him, looping my arms around his neck. "So...are you free that day?"

Brandon caught my hand, pressing a kiss to my palm. "Are you planning to tell themn about us? That we're married?"

"That's the plan," I replied, suddenly nervous again. "I think it's time."

"Good," he murmured, pulling me closer.




Two days later, I stood in front of the mirror, smoothing down the front of my emerald green dress. I'd chosen something festive but tasteful-perfect for a family birthday celebration. My hair was swept up in an elegant twist,and I'd even put on the pearl earrings Brandon had given me last month.

I was just fastening the clasp on my bracelet when my phone rang.Brandon's name flashed on the screen, and I felt a flutter of excitement. He'd been in the city all day dealing with some urgent business, but had promised to be back in time for us to drive to the Taylor estate together.
"Hey! Are you on your way home?" I answered cheerfully.

His heavy sigh immediately dampened my mood. "June, I'm sorry,but I don't think I can make it today."
My heart sank. "What? Why not? We were supposed to leave in less than an hour."
"There's an emergency at the Stark mansion," Brandon explained, his voice tight with frustration. "I need to go there right away."

"But..." I struggled to keep the disappointment from my voice. "I promised Grandpa I'd bring you. My parents are expecting me to bring..."I trailed off, not wanting to make him feel worse.

"Tll ask Sean to go with you," Brandon suggested.

"No, no need," I replied quickly. The last thing I wanted was to drag Sean into my family drama.

"I'm worried about you," Brandon insisted, his tone brooking no argument.
"Besides your grandfather George, nobody else in the Taylor family knows we're married. If you show up alone, they might give you a hard time. Sean can help keep things... civil."

I sighed, knowing he was right. The Taylors had never been kind to me when I was alone and vulnerable.

"Alright," I relented, trying to mask my disappointment. "I'll go with Sean."

"Come home early," Brandon said softly.

"You too," I replied, then ended the call.

I stared at my reflection in the mirror, watching as my excited smile faded into resignation. So much for my big plans to introduce Brandon as my husband.




I'd barely left the driveway when my phone rang again. This time it was Sean.
"Summer, where are you right now?" he asked without preamble.
"I just left the house." I replied, keeping my eyes on the road. "Where are you?"


"At the hospital," Sean answered. "Just finished up. Think you could swing by and pick me up?"

"Sure," I agreed, already adjusting my route mentally. "Thanks for doing this,Dr.Sean."


"No problem," he replied easily. "See you soon."

As I drove toward Manhattan General, I couldn't help wondering what was really happening at the Stark mansion. Brandon had seemed genuinely disappointed about missing the birthday celebration.Whatever had come up must be serious.

I pulled up in front of thehospital in the sleek red Ferrari-a car Sean had lost to Brandon in some ridiculous bet months ago. Now Brandon occasionally let me drive it, claiming it matched my "fiery personality."
I spotted Sean immediately, looking surprisingly dapper in a charcoal suit.I rolled down the window and called out, "Dr. Sean! Over here!"
He slid into the passenger seat with a low whistle. Nice ride. Brandon's letting you drive the Ferrari now?"
"Seatbelt," I reminded him, not in the mood for his usual teasing.

Sean caught my expression and buckled up without further comment.

As we drove toward upstate New York, I could feel Sean studying me.

"So," he finally said, breaking the silence, "Brandon couldn't make it and sent me instead. You must be pretty disappointed."
I tightened my grip on the steering wheel. "Dr. Sean, seatbelt," I repeated,though he was already wearing it.
Sean raised his hands in surrender. "Got it. No talking about the husband.Strictly business today."

The rest of the drive passed in relative silence. As we approached the sprawling Taylor estate. I couldn't help the knot of anxiety forming in my stomach. Through the wrought iron gates, I could already see dozens of cars parked in the circular driveway, indicating the party was well underway.

"Brandon mentioned this was your father's birthday," Sean remarked as I pulled into a parking space.

"Not my father," I corrected automatically. "Richard Taylor."

I shut off the engine and sat for a moment, staring at the manor house. Its grand facade had once been intimidating, a physical representation ofmy outsider status within the family. Now it just looked... empty. Soulless.
"If you hate this place so much, why did you insist on coming?" Sean asked softly.

I turned to him, surprised by his perceptiveness. "Sometimes it's notabout what you want to do. It's about what you need to do." I opened my door."Let's go."

Sean grabbed the elegantly wrapped gifts from the back seat. "I'll take these."

"Thanks, Sean," I said, genuinely appreciative. "But remember, in there,you're not Sean Sullivan."
"Right," he grinned, adjusting his tie. "Can't believe I'm still posing as my cousin after all this time. If Jesse ever finds out, he won't let me off easy."
With a deep breath, I straightened my shoulders and headed toward the entrance. Time to face the Taylors once more.
###Chapter 291: Real Michael

Summer's POV

The Ferrari purred to a stop in front of the Taylor mansion's imposing entrance. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what was sure to be an uncomfortable evening.

As Parker led us through the grand foyer, I couldn't help but notice how little the place had changed-stilI cold, still imposing, still feeling nothing like home. The sound of classical music and forced laughter drifted from the main hall, growing louder as we approached.

We'd barely crossed the threshold when I spotted Elizabeth's hawk-like gaze zeroing in on us from across the room. She was standing with an elegant older woman I didn't recognize, and the moment she saw us,her entire demeanor transformed.

"Look who's here, just as we were speaking of them!" Elizabeth exclaimed to the woman, her voice carrying across the room. "My daughter and her boyfriend have arrived. If you'll excuse me..."

Elizabeth practically sprinted toward us, her face contorted in what I assumed was meant to be a warm, motherly smile but looked more like she was fighting a bad case of indigestion.
"Summer, you finally made it!" She reached for my hands, squeezing them with uncomfortable intensity.′′Iwas just talking about you!"
Her gaze shifted to Sean, and her smile widened even further."Michael!You came too!"
I felt Sean stiffen beside me.

"Mrs. Taylor," he replied, his eyes narrowing slightly.

"Now, now." Elizabeth trilled, her eyes crinkling with false warmth. She turned back to me, hovering like we were suddenly best friends.

I frowned. completely bewildered by her behavior. In all my years as part of this family. Elizabeth had never once been genuinely happy to see me.This sudden affection was as suspicious as it was unsettling.

Sean seemed equally confused by Elizabeth's greeting, but before either of us could say anything more, I noticed someone familiar entering the room.My confusion deepened as I recognized the woman-elegant,with the same aristocratic features as Sean, accompanied by a tall, distinguished-looking man.

Sean caught sight of them at the same moment I did. He immediately pressed his palm to his forehead in a gesture of pure dismay.

"Oh shit," he muttered under his breath.

"Is that...?" I whispered, as realization dawned.

"My aunt Daisy," Sean confirmed with a grimace. "And that's my cousin Jesse beside her."
"Your cousin? The *real* Michael Sullivan is here?" I stared at him in disbelief. "Why didn'tyou tell me?"
"I had no idea they were coming," Sean hissed back. "This is going to be awkward as hell."

Across the room, Elizabeth had spotted Daisy as well and was making her way over with the same exaggerated enthusiasm she'd shown us.
"Daisy! You finally made it!" Elizabeth called out, reaching for Daisy's hand. "Micheal has been here for quite some time already!"
Daisy smoothly sidestepped Elizabeth's attempt to grab her hand, her brow
furrowing slightly. "My son has been here for a while?" She glanced questioningly at the man beside her-the real Jesse Turner.

Jesse's face remained perfectly impassive, showing no reaction whatsoever.

Elizabeth's gaze settled on the man standing next to Daisy, taking in his commanding presence. "Daisy,who is this gentleman?"

Daisy's lips curved into a slight smile. "My son, Jesse Turner. I thought you knew him, Mrs. Taylor?"

Elizabeth's jaw literally dropped. "*This* is Michael?" Her head swiveled back to where Sean and I stood, her eyes widening in horror. "Daisy, are you joking? This man is Michael,so who is *that*?"

Daisy followed Elizabeth's pointing finger, and the moment her eyes landed on Sean, the entire room seemed to fall silent. Everyone was watching now, the drama unfolding like a slow-motion car crash.
After a brief moment of surprise, understanding dawned on Daisy's face."Sean? What are you doing here?"

The murmurs that erupted around the room were almost comical. I could practically see the wheels turning in the guests' minds as they realized they were in the presence of not just one but two of New York's elite bachelors-Michael Sullivan *and* Dr. Sean Sullivan.
Sean sighed,accepting that there was no graceful way out of this mess. He gave me a resigned look. "Come on, let's go meet my aunt."
I exhaled heavily, mentally kicking myself. "I should have just come alone.This is so embarrassing."
It suddenly hit me why Elizabeth had been so welcoming-she thought Sean was Michael, apparently someone she was eager to impress. The woman was truly unbelievable.
"Let's get this over with," I muttered.

Sean led the way across the room, his face arranged in a deliberately innocent expression. "Hey, Aunt Daisy! Cousin Jesse!"

Daisy's eyes flicked between Sean and her son before settling back on Sean with a knowing look. "Well? Care to explain what you're doing here?"

Sean shrugged with feigned casualness. "Just thought I'd check out the Taylor family gathering, see what all the fuss was about." He gestured toward me. "Aunt Daisy, this is Summer, my friend."

"Miss Taylor," Daisy acknowledged, her tone indicating she knew exactly who I was despite never having met me.

"Mrs. Sullivan, it's a pleasure to meet you," I replied, maintaining my composure despite the awkwardness.

Elizabeth, meanwhile, had gone from pale to flushed with anger as the full reality of the situation crashed down on her. "You're not Michael?" she practically spat at Sean. "Then what have you been doing with my daughter all this time? This is deception, plain and simple!"
Sean's smile remained fixed, though his eyes hardeñed slightly."With all due respect, MIrs. Taylor, I never claimed to be Michael."
"You-" Elizabeth sputtered.

Sean's expression didn't change, but the temperature around him seemed to drop several degrees.
Before Elizabeth could continue her tirade, Daisy intervened. "Behaving foolishly as usual, I see," she said, giving Sean a stern look that didn't quite reach her eyes. "Your relationship with Miss Taylor is your business,but you should have been clear with Mrs. Taylor. This misunderstanding reflects poorly on both you and your cousin,"
Elizabeth was clearly fuming, but she seemed to realize she couldn't make a scene-not with so many high-profile guests watching, and especially not with Daisy and Jesse right there. No matter how angry she was,Dr.Sean Sullivan wasn't someone she could afford to antagonize.

I could practically see the calculations running behind her eyes as she reassessed the situation. She'd never met Sean before, but his reputation clearly preceded him. The look she gave me was filled with confusion and something else-a dawning realization that perhaps she'd underestimated me and my social connections all along.

She'd assumed my friends were nobody important, that Jesse Turner was only accessible to me through her connection with Daisy. Finding out I was friends with Sean Sullivan independently had thrown her for a loop.

Jesse broke the uncomfortable silence by stepping forward. "Summer, it's been a while," he said cordially, extending his hand. The simple gesture and familiar greeting made it clear that we already knew each other-another shock for Elizabeth and the onlookers.

"Good to see you, Mr. Turner," I replied, shaking his hand with a polite smile.

Daisy's eyes widened with interest as she watched our exchange. Jesse leaned close to her ear, whispering something that made her glance at me with new appreciation.
Across the room, I caught sight of Victoria standing next to Richard, her eyes burning with hatred as she watched the entire scene unfold.
Some things never change, I thought to myself. No matter what happened.Victoria would always see me as competition-even now that I wanted nothing to do with the life she so desperately clung to.
###Chapter 292: That Woman Is Back!

Brandon's POV

The sleek black Bentley purred to a stop in front of the Stark mansion.I sat motionless behind the wheel for a moment, staring at the imposing family estate. The emergency call about my grandfather's deteriorating health had interrupted an important meeting, forcing me to rush across town. But something felt off.

William Stark didn't summon people to his deathbed lightly.

As I stepped out of the car, the evening air carried a chill that matched my mood. I draped my suit jacket over my arm and headed toward the entrance.

The family butler materialized before I reached the door, his face lighting up with exaggerated relief. "Mr. Stark! You've arrived!"

I acknowledged him with a curt nod."Yes."

His performance was too eager, too rehearsed. My suspicions deepened as I stepped into the grand foyer, the marble floors gleaming under crystal chandeliers.

"Brandon!" A familiar female voice called out from the living room.

I froze at the entrance, my body instantly tensing as I took in the scene before me. William sat in his usual armchair, looking far too healthy for someone supposedly at death's door. My father Robert and Jane Sinclair stood nearby, expressions carefully neutral. Uncle Gavin and Aunt Meave occupied the sofa, while my sister Sarah perched uncomfortably on an ottoman. In the corner, Angela played with a small boy I'd never seen before.
The source of the voice stood at the center of it all. Lyanna York. The
woman I'd sent away three years ago.

My blood ran cold as I surveyed the room, deliberately avoiding her eyes."I thought William was bedridden. Critically ill?" I asked, my voice dripping with sarcasm.

When no one answered, I turned to leave. "Since the situation isn't as dire as reported, I'll be going."

Three voices called out simultaneously, stopping me in my tracks:

"You stay right there!" William barked.

"Uncle Brandon!" Angela's excited squeal.

"Daddy!" The little boy's voice hit me like a physical blow.

I paused, a dangerous energy coursing through me as I slowly turned back around. Before I could respond, two small figures darted across the room.Angela, my sister's daughter, wrapped herself around my right leg, while the unfamiliar boy latched onto my left, looking up at me with wide eyes.
"Uncle Brandon! You came!" Angela beamed.

"Daddy! Daddy home!" the boy chirped, his face a dsturbing blend of hopeful innocence.
The room fell silent, the air thick with tension. I felt may expression harden as I gently detached Angela and lifted her into my arms. With my other hand, I firmly pushed the boy away.
He tumbled backward, landing on his bottom with a surprised thud. Hlis face crumpled immediately,"Waaah! Mommy!"
"Timothy!" Lyanna rushed forward, scooping up the crying child. She cast her eyes up at me, that practiced wounded look I knew all too well."Brandon, Timothy is just-
"Lyanna York." I cut her off, my voice dropping to a dangerous whisper."I told you what would happen if you dared return to New York."

Her face paled. "I... Brandon. I..."

"This is my home too," she finally managed, clutching the boy tighter. "Is it so wrong for me to come back? Especially when Timothy needs-"

"Seems like you're eager to face the consequences," I said softly,my lips curving into a cold smile.

William's cane struck the floor with a sharp crack. "Enough of this nonsense!" he thundered. "Lyanna is your fiancée, Tímothy is your son!Who do you think you're speaking to like that? I'm the one who brought them back!"

"So that's how it is," I replied, my voice deceptively calm. "Well played,Grandfather."

I set Angela gently on her feet and turned to Sarah. "It's getting late. Sarah.let me drive you and Angela home."
Sarah hesitated only briefly, clearly uncomfortable but smart enough to know where to place her loyalty. "Yes, it is laté. Angela has school tomorrow. We should go."

As she gathered her purse, she couldn't resist glancing at Lyanna. The history between them was complicated, but Sarah had always been perceptive.

"Angela, would you like Uncle Brandon to take us home?" Sarah asked,her voice deliberately bright.
"Yay! Yay!" Angela bounced excitedly. "I haven't seen Uncle Brandon in forever! I missed you so much! Uncle Brandon is my favorite!"
I felt my expression soften slightly. "And Angela is Uncle's favorite too."I tweaked her nose, earning a delighted giggle.

"Stop right there!" William roared, rising from his chair and raising his cane threateningly.

Lyanna moved between us. "William, please don't!"

My grandfather's face flushed dark with anger. "Brandon Stark, I'm not dead yet! You think your position as Stark Group CEO is secure? Without my support, do you think the shareholders would stand behind you?"

"Is that a threat, Grandfather?" I asked, my voice dangerously quiet.

"If you had any real power, you wouldn't fear an old man's threats," he spat.
"Indeed." I matched his gaze evenly. "Lee Enterprises' current predicament is quite illuminating, isn't it? Their century-old empire dismantled piece by piece. Even at your age, Grandfather, surely you've heard the rumors about how that happened."
William's eyes narrowed, understanding my implication perfectly.

I took Angela from Sarah's arms, balancing her on my hip as I delivered my parting shot: "A child of Brandon Stark cannot be born without my permission. In this world, only my wife can bear my children."
Without waiting for a response, I turned and walked out, Sarah close behind me. I heard Lyanna call my name once more, but I didn't look back.



In the car, Angela chattered happily in the backseat while Sarah sat silently beside me.
"That was quite the performance back there," she finally said, her voice low enough that Angela wouldn't hear.

"William overplayed his hand," I replied, eyes fixed on the road.

"That boy..." Sarah began hesitantly.

"Is not mine." My grip tightened on the steering wheel.

"Are you certain?"

"Completely."

Sarah sighed. "William won't let this go. He'll use them to try to force you and Summer apart."

"Let him try," I said coldly.

"Brandon.." Sarah's voice grew serious. "What are you planning to do?"

I glanced at her, then at Angela in the rearview mirror. "Nothing you need to worry about. Focus on keeping Angela away from the mansion for a while."

Sarah nodded, understanding immediately. "Consider it done."

As we drove through the night, my mind raced with calculations. William had made his move, bringing Lyanna and this supposed child back into play. But he'd severely underestimated how much had changed in three years.


I wasn't the same man. And Summer wasn't just another pawn in his game.
###Chapter 293 Pawns

Summer's POV

The cool night air was a welcome relief as I escaped the suffocating atmosphere of te Taylor mansion. I leaned against a stone pillar in the back garden and pulled out my phone, missing Brandon terribly despite Sean's presence at the party.

Brandon picked up on the second ring.

"Hey!" His deep voice sent warmth through me.

"Brandon, are you home yet?" I asked, keeping my voice down.

"Mmm."

"Did you just get home?"

"Yeah."

"Brandon, I'm seriously regretting not bringing you today. Ugh!"

I frowned at his unusual shortness. "You're not even going to ask me what happened today?"
"Mmm."

Something was definitely off.

"Brandon? What's wrong? Are you upset about something?"

When he didn't immediately respond, my stomach tightened.

"Did something happen at the Stark house? Is it... about us? About our marriage?"
"Nothing's wrong," he finally said, his voice flat. "What happened at the
Taylor house today? Did someone give you trouble? Didn't Sean protect you?"

Relief washed over me. "Oh no, nothing like that! Actually. Dr. Sean made a complete fool of himself today. He showed up pretending to be Michael Turner, but then guess what? The *real* Michael also showed up!"

I giggled softly. "I'm hiding in the back garden right now. You should have seen my mother's face-she was absolutely livíd, but she couldn't make a scene. I was wondering why she was being so nice to me today!Turns out she had planned to use my dad's birthday party to get closer to Mrs. Sullivan and Jesse Turner. She definitely had some scheme cooking,but then Dr. Sean crashed the party and ruined everything."

I lowered my voice. "It's such a shame you couldn't come. You would have driven them absolutely crazy! My mother's grand plans would have completely fallen apart."

"Sounds like you're pretty disappointed," Brandon remarked, his voice warming slightly.
"Of course I am!" I exclaimed. "Ever since I found out I'm not their biological daughter, everything's different. I'm so tired of being their little chess piece. First Charles Windsor, then Jesse Turner,now Dr. Sean-she's been trying to marry me off to whoever benefits them most."
"God, it's so boring here, but I can't just leave right away," I complained.

"Where are Sean and Jesse now?" Brandon asked.

"Oh, they're being fawned over by everyone. You should see it-everyone's practically climbing over each other to talk to them." I smiled. "Brandon, I miss you so much."
"I miss you too," he replied, his voice finally softening.
Through the phone. I heard rustling fabric-like he was putting on a jacket.


"Brandon? Are you going somewhere?"

Before he could answer, I caught sight of movement. "Someone's coming.I've gotta go!"

I quickly ended the call and pretended to admire a nearby rose bush. The clicking of heels against the stone path announced Elizabeth's approach.

"There you are, you little brat! Hiding out here all this time?"

Elizabeth stood before me, her perfectly made-up face twisted with anger beneath her polished socialite mask.

"Tell me the truth," she hissed. "Did you know all along that Sean Sullivan wasn't Michael Sullivan?"

I met her gaze evenly. "I don't understand what you're talking about,Mother. They're both Sullivan men-even you got them confused. How would I know the difference?"

"Don't play dumb with me."

"Isn't Daisy supposed to be your dear friend?" I continued."How awkward that you couldn't even recognize your good friend's son! That must have been∗SO∗embarrassing for you."
"You ungrateful little-" She raised her hand as if to slap me, but stopped herself."You worthless girl!"
"Worthless girl?" I echoed, my voice surprisingly steady. "Is that what I am to you,Mother?"
"I-"Elizabeth faltered.
"Well,now I know." I continued coolly. "Actually, whether it's Dr.Sean or Michael,you should be thrilled either way. The Taylors connecting with the Sullivans or T'urners would be quite the social coup. wouldn't it?"

"You... you insolent little brat! Don't talk about things you don't understand," she sputtered. "The Taylor family has its own standing in New York!"

"Really? Then why are you so desperate to marry me off to a Sullivan or a Turner?" I countered.

Elizabeth stared at me like she'd never seen me before. This wasn't the meek, accommodating Summer she was used to pushing around.

"You need to cut ties with that Dr. Sean immediately," she ordered. "Jesse Turner is the one I've chosen for you. As you know, his mother Daisy and I are dear friends!"

"Right,how could I forget? You're such close friends," I replied with mock seriousness."Why don't you go speak to Mrs. Sullivan about it yourself?"
"You-" Her face flushed with rage. "Don't test me, young lady.I'm telling you,the only reason you even know people like the Sullivans and Turners is because of *me*. I made those connections possible! You ungrateful,disrespectful child-I am your mother!"
"Enough!" I snapped, my patience shattering. "Let's get something straight.
I met Dr. Sean and Jesse Turner through my own connections. I don't need you orchestrating my life anymore. I'm done being your pawn in whatever social climbing game you're playing!"
I took a deep breath. "I've learned something imnportant lately. Sometimes the best thing you can do is let go of what was never really yours to begin with."
Elizabeth stared at me, speechless. I brushed past her headino tora
quieter part of the garden.




"Miss Summer!"

I nearly jumped at the voice behind me. Jesse Turner stood there,impeccably dressed in a tailored suit.

"Mr. Turner! I'm so sorry!" I gasped, mortified.

"I got a free show," he said with a slight smile. "No need for you to apologize."

I cringed inwardly. "That was my mistake."

"I had no idea Sean was coming today," he added.

"And I had no idea you'd be here either." I shook my head."Actually,I should apologize properly. It's been nearly six months, and Sean is still using your name. It's caused you trouble, and I'm truly sorry about that."
"It's fine," he replied with unexpected ease.

"And about what my mother just said-please don't take any of it to heart.



Jesse studied me for a moment. "You know, Summer,you're not at all what I expected."
"What do you mean?"

"Sean talks about you a lot-his 'little sister.' He makes you sound so fragile." A hint of a smile played at his lips. "But you're actually quite formidable,aren't you?"
I felt my cheeks warm. "I don't know about that. I'm just tired of being
everyone's chess piece."

"I understand completely." His gaze shifted toward the house."Family expectations can be... suffocating."

As we stood there in the quiet garden, I had the strangest feeling that Jesse Turner might be one of the few people who actually did understand.

"We should probably head back before they send out a search party," I suggested.

Jesse nodded,extending his arm. "Shall we?"
###Chapter 294 He Came For Me

Summer's POV

Dr. Sean had been searching for me throughout the entire birthday party,finally spotting me as Jesse Turner and I walked back inside from the garden.


"There you are!" Dr. Sean called out, relief washing over his face. "I've been looking everywhere for you. I was starting to think something had happened!"

I rolled my eyes. "I just needed some fresh air."

"Yeah, well, if anything had happened to you, Brandon would've had my head," he grumbled, straightening his suit jacket.

"You're being so dramatic," I laughed. "I'm fine, so Brandon won't be 'having your head' after all."
Dr. Sean huffed. "It's not that I'm afraid of Brandon or anything. I just don't like unnecessary,trouble."
I glanced at Jesse Turner, who was watching our exchange with barely concealed amusement. "See? Even Mr. Turner thinks I'm right."
"Hey!" Dr. Sean protested, pointing an accusing finger at me. "Whose side are you on anyway? Every time you need something. I'm the one who helps you out! This guy"-he gestured toward Jesse-"hasn't done anything!"
"Okay, okay," I said, patting his arm. "You're the best, Dr. Sullivan. Now.would you mind driving me home?"
His expression softened. "That's more like it."

The three of us made our way toward the mansio's frtT
silently congratulated myself on escaping without anoter confrontation with Elizabeth. The cool night air was a welcome relief after the stuffy atmosphere inside.

Something felt different as we stepped outside-the hairs on theback of my neck stood up. I glanced around the circular driveway, my heart skipping a beat when I spotted a familiar black Bentley parked near the gate.


"Brandon?" I whispered, my pulse quickening.

Without thinking, I broke into a run, leaving Dr. Sean and Jesse Turner behind. I couldn't stop the smile spreading across my face or the feeling of warmth flooding my chest.

"Brandon!" I called out, watching as he opened the car door.

He barely had one foot on the ground before I crashed into him, wrapping my arms around his waist and burying my face against his chest. The solid warmth of him instantly made everything-the dreadful party,Elizabeth's confrontation, all of it-fade away.
"What's wrong?" Brandon asked, his voice softening as he stroked my hair.

"Nothing," I murmured, tightening my grip. "I just missed you."

I tilted my head back to look at him. "How did you get here? I thought you were at home when I called you."
His thumb traced the line of my cheekbone, his touch sending little shivers down my spine. "Missed you," he said simply, his voice low. "Don't want to see me?"

"No! That's not it at all," I insisted, shaking my head emphatically."It's just-we were on the phone half an hour ago and you said you were home. Did you drive like a maniac to get here?"
"Wanted to see you," he replied, keeping me close. "So I came."

Satisfaction bloomed in my chest. No matter how many times Brandon showed his feelings this way, it still made my heart race. "Fine, I'll forgive you for today." I nestled deeper into his arms, finding that perfect spot against his chest. "But why didn't you call to tell me you were outside?Were you just going to wait out here alone in the cold?"

"I was fine. Waiting for you."

My smile widened, and I pressed closer. "Well, don't do this again, okay?What if my parents had kept me trapped inside? Or what if I hadn't come out so soon? It's freezing out here!"

Brandon's chest rumbled with soft laughter. "Alright, I get it. My mistake."

My eyes widened as I suddenly remembered we weren't alone. I turned to look over my shoulder, my cheeks burning when I spotted Dr. Sean, Jesse.and an elegant older woman I recognized as Daisy Sullivan watching us with undisguised interest.

Daisy's expression shifted from surprise to understanding, her initial shock giving way to a knowing look. I could practically see the realization dawning on her-the infamous Brandon Stark, rumored to be unapproachable, especially by women, had simply been waiting for the right one.

I hastily stepped back, though I remained within arm's reach. "Why didn't you warn me?" I hissed, embarrassment coloring my voice.
Brandon ignored Dr. Sean's teasing, focusing instead on Daisy. "Mrs.Sullivan," he greeted respectfully.
Daisy's eyes sparkled with amusement. "Married and didn't bother to tell me?"
Brandon slipped his arm around my waist. "We kept the wedding quiet-just a few close friends. We'Il be sure to invite you when we have a proper celebration."

"You're a lucky man," Daisy replied, glancing approvingly at me. "She's wonderful-truly our family's loss, Jesse."

Jesse stepped forward, his expression carefully neutral. "Mother, Mr.Stark and Miss Taylor were already married before I even met her."

Daisy's eyebrows rose. "That early?" Her gaze flickered toward the mansion."But the Taylors seem..."

I laughed nervously. "Only my grandfather George and Professor Thompson know about our marriage," I explained.

Daisy nodded thoughtfully before changing subjects, launching into a familiar lament about her son and nephew's perpetual bachelor status.
"Aunt Daisy," Dr. Sean interrupted, "it's getting late, and we're just standing in front of the Taylor mansion like we're casing the joint."
Jesse nodded. "Mr. and Mrs. Stark likely have plans."

"Of course," Daisy conceded. "But promise me an invitation when you host your wedding celebration."

"Absolutely," Brandon assured her.




Once we were alone in the car, I couldn't stop talking, the relief of being away from the Taylor mansion making me almost giddy. Brandon's presence had completely dissolved the tension I'd been carrying all evening.
"Brandon," I said suddenly, shifting in my seat to face him, "what happened at the Stark house today? Was it serious?"
I noticed his grip on the steering wheel tighten. "Nothing significant. Just the old man playing games."

I fell silent, studying his profile. Something had definitely happened with William Stark, probably related to our marriage. Whatever it was, Brandon clearly didn't want to discuss it, and I didn't want to push.

"Did you eat dinner?" I asked, changing the subject.

Brandon glanced at me. "You haven't eaten?"

"Well..." I fidgeted with the hem of my dress. "There were so many guests,and..."

"And the Taylors were hounding you?" he finished, an edge creeping into his voice. "You don't have to tolerate that, you know."

I sighed dramatically. "Don't you think I know that? But Elizabeth still managed to corner me in the garden."

Brandon frowned, but then asked, "What do you want to eat?"

My mood instantly brightened. "Steak! I've been craving it all day.Will you take me? Please?" I tugged at his arm, giving him my best pleading look.

"Where do you want to go?" he asked.

"Our usual place should be perfect-not too crowded at this hour."I squeezed his arm excitedly. "And I'm paying tonight!"
As he drove toward the restaurant, I couldn't help stealing glances at him.Despite his calm exterior, I could tell something was weighing on him.Whatever had happened at the Stark mansion must have been serious.
But for now, I was just happy he had come for me, rescuing me from yet another miserable Taylor family gathering. That's what we did for sach
other-provide escape when the world became too much.
###Chapter 295 Your Grandfather Is Too Much

Summer's POV

Something was definitely up with Brandon.

For the past few days, I'd noticed him acting strangely-taking calls in hushed tones. disappearing into his study for hours, and exchanging cryptic glances with Dr. Sean, who'd been visiting our Hamptons estate way more frequently than usual. The two of them clearly had some secret they weren't sharing, and it was starting to drive me crazy.

I was determined to get to the bottom of it, so I headed to Brandon's study,where I knew the two of them were holed up. As I approached,I heard their muffled voices through the door, but they fell silent the moment I knocked.


When I pushed the door open, the scene before me was almost comical. Dr.Sean stood abruptly from his chair, looking like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. Brandon sat behind his desk, his expression carefully controlled.
"Oh! Hey there, sis!" Dr. Sean exclaimed, his voice unnaturally high. "Just.uh,messing around with your husband! You know how we do!"
"I was actually just leaving," he said,gathering his things with suspicious speed. "Got a surgery scheduled in..." he checked his watch dramatically,"...an hour ago! Shit,gotta run!"
As he brushed past me, he clasped Brandon's shoulder firmly, "Remember what I said, man. Tell her."
And with that cryptic parting statement, he was gone, leaving me standing in the doorway,thoroughly confused.
"What was that about?" I asked,crossing my arms as I approached
Brandon's desk.

Brandon shrugged, leaning back in his chair. "He's having a moment. You know how he gets."

"Yeah, right." I scoffed, not buying it for a second. "What were you two talking about?"

Brandon's expression tightened almost imperceptibly, but I knew him well enough to notice. He sighed, running a hand through his hair.

"It's nothing major," he said finally. "There's just... something I should probably mention to you."

I perched on the edge of his desk, heart starting to pound."What is it?Why all the mystery?"

Instead of answering. Brandon stood and took my hand. "Come with me."

He led me out of the study and upstairs to our bedroom, closing the door behind us. The seriousness of his demeanor was making me nervous.
"Brandon," I said softly as he guided me to sit on the edge of the bed."What's going on? Did something happen?"
He sat beside me, his eyes searching mine. "Before I tell you, I need you to promise me something."

"Anything," I responded automatically.

"No matter what anyone says to you in thecoming days,trust me.Okay?"

My stomach dropped. Whatever this was, it wasn't good. "Brandon,you're scaring me. Just tell me what's happening."
"We're married," he said, his voice steady and assured. "You're my wife.Nothing changes that."
"I know," I replied, confused by the sudden declaration. "Brandon, please,just tell me what's going on."

He took a deep breath. "Tomorrow, you might meet someone."

I waited, my anxiety building with each passing second.

"Her name is Lyanna York," he continued finally. "She's... an old acquaintance. The woman the Stark family once intended for me to marry."

The room seemed to tilt slightly. I felt my fingers tighten in his, my face draining of color as the implications hit me.

"She's back?" I managed to ask, my voice barely above a whisper. "And let me guess-your family wants you to be with her instead of me? Is that why you couldn't come with me to my father's birthday party?"
Brandon nodded slowly, his eyes never leaving mine.

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to think rationally. "But you came to find me that night anyway," I said, remembering how he'd shown up at the Taylor mansion. "And regardless of what your family wants, you married *me*.Whether they approve or not, I'm your wife, and alI I need is your acknowledgment of that, right?"
Brandon's eyebrows rose slightly, surprise flickering across his features.He'd clearly expected a different reaction-tears, maybe, or anger.
"You're not upset?" he asked cautiously.

I laughed softly, though it came out a bit strained. "Oh, I'm upset. How could I not be? But I'm upset because I care. You chose to tell me about this instead of hiding it, and while I'm not thrilled, I do understand."
I moved closer to him, resting my hand on his chest. "Look, at your age, it would be weird if you didn't have a past. I haive one too, and you know
all about it. I'm a normal woman-of course I'm jealous and upset. But that was your past. right? You chose me now, which means you've moved on from whatever was between you two. You're completely mine now,right?"

"Yes." Brandon answered firmly.

I exhaled slowly, some of the tension leaving my body. "See? Now I know,I've had my little moment of anger, and you don't need to keep looking so grim."


Suddenly,something he'd said earlier caught up with me. "Wait, you said I might *meet* her tomorrow. What does that mean exactly?"

When Brandon didn't immediately respond, a terrible thought crossed my mind. "She's not coming to the company, is she?"
His continued silence confirmed my suspicion. I stared at him in growing disbelief.

"Your grandfather arranged this, didn't he?"

More silence.

"Please don't tell me your grandfather managed to get her a position as your secretary or something!"
Brandon's face remained expressionless, which told me everything I needed to know.

"Oh my God, he actually did?" I threw my hands up in exasperation."Your grandfather is too much! Why does he dislike me so intensely? 1barely know the man!"
I paced across the room, piecing it together, "I get it. He thinks if she works closely with you, she'll have a chance to win you back. But what he
doesn't realize is..." I turned back to Brandon with a confident smile, "you are already mine."

Brandon's lips twitched upward at my metaphor.

"I'm seriouisly pissed off, you know," I continued, returning to sit beside him. "But when I think about it-she may have been your fiancée once,but she never became your wife.∗I∗m∗your wife. *My* name is in the spouse column on your documents. So I guess I don't really have anything to be angry about, unless you decide you don't want me anymore. No one can take you from me!"

I grabbed his hands, squeezing them tightly. "Say it. Say you're mine."

"T'm yours," Brandon replied without hesitation, his eyes never leaving mine.

"And if I couldn't, handle even this much, I wouldn't deserve to stand beside you," I added softly. "But that doesn't mean I'm thrilled about having her hanging around you all day. You better behave yourself!"
"I've already instructed Monica to give her the more tedious, detailed work," Brandon assured me. "And you know how many secretaries I have-Monica is the only one who can enter my office."
I felt my shoulders relax a bit. "Well, that's something at least."


As Brandon pulled me closer, I couldn't help the whisper of doubt that lingered in my mind. "Brandon," I thought silently, "you know I've been betrayed once before. Please don't let it happen a second time."
Brandon's eyes darkened as he leaned in. "The night is short, my love," he murmured against my ear.
I closed my eyes and let him hold me, pushing away my fears for another day.
###Chapter 296 Meeting Lyanna

Summer's POV

I glanced at the clock for what felt like the hundredth time that morning.We were officially late for work, and I was deliberately making us even later.


"Brandon. I can't find my blue portfolio," I called out, pretending to search through my already perfectly organized bag.

"It's on your desk," Brandon replied from the doorway, car keys dangling from his fingers. His voice was patient, completely unfazed by my obvious stalling.

"Right," I mumbled, grabbing the portfolio. "And I need to change my shoes...these don't match."

Brandon just leaned against the doorframe, watching me with that infuriating calm of his.

"Aren't you going to say anything?" I finally demanded.

"About what?"

"About the fact that I'm making us late on purpose!"

Brandon's smile widened slightly. "Why would I be upset about that?"

I stared at him, deflating. "Because normal people get mad when other people deliberately waste their time?"

He reached out to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear. "You're not wasting my time. You're showing me you care." His voice dropped. "If you didn't care at all about Lyanna, that would worry me more."
I flushed. "I don't care about her." I insisted stubbornly. "I just don't want
to go to work today."

"Mmm-hmm."

Brandon picked up my bag and handed it to me. "We should go. Unless you'd prefer to call in sick?"

The temptation was real. I could curl up in bed and avoid the whole Lyanna situation entirely. But that wasn't me. I'd never been one to run from my problems.

I might not be the most aggressive person, but I wasn't a pushover either.If Brandon's grandfather thought he could intimidate me by bringing in some ex-fiancée, he had seriously misjudged the situation.

"Let's go," I said firmly. "I've kept you waiting long enough."




"You can drop me off right at the entrance," I instructed as we approached Stark Group headquarters. "I know you usually use the underground parking,but today let's make an exception."

Brandon raised an eyebrow but complied, pulling the Bentley up to the main entrance where dozens of employees were streaming in. Heads turned immediately at the sight of the CEO's car.

"Perfect," I whispered, satisfaction coursing through me. By lunchtime,everyone would know I'd arrived with Brandon.

I gathered my things. "I'll see you later?"

"Wait," Brandon said, reaching behind his seat. He handed me a small paper bag-the cookies I'd baked for him. "You forgot this."

"That's for you!" I protested.
"I know," he said, the comner of his mouth quirking upward."But you were in such a rush this morning you forgot to actually give them to me."
I felt heat rise to my cheeks. Clearly, my little performance hadn't fooled him.

"Go on," he said, nodding toward the building. "You're already late."

"Oh! Right!" I fumbled with the bag. "I should head up then. You should come up soon too!"


I could feel dozens of curious eyes on us as I climbed out of the car.The whispers started immediately.




I was still riding the high of my dramatic entrance when I reached the project department. The stares and whispers followed me, but they felt different than I'd expected-more intense, almost unsettling.

"Summer, you finally made it!" Heather Bell practically pounced on me the moment I entered. Her eyes were wide with excitement and apprehension.

"What's going on?" I asked. "Why's everyone acting so weird?"

Heather pulled me into the break room. "Where were you yesterday? You missed all the drama!"

"I was working from home," I replied cautiously. "What drama?"

"Oh my God," Heather lowered her voice. "The company got a new addition yesterday-some drop-dead gorgeous woman who's working directly with Mr. Stark!"

I kept my expression neutral. "I know. What about her?"

"Wait, you already know? Okay, but... don't get mad when I tell you this
"Why would I get mad? What, does she have three heads or something?"

"No, she doesn't have three heads, but.." Heather glanced around nervously. "She looks exactly like you. And I mean 'exactly+. It's freaky.Summer. Like looking at twins."

The room seemed to tilt. I'd known about Lyanna coming to work here.but this part? The part where we looked identical? Brandon had conveniently left that detail out.

"What did you just say?" I managed, my voice sounding distant.

"Summer? Are you okay? You look really pale."

"I'm fine," I said automatically. "I just remembered I need to check something. If Leo asks, tell him I'll be back soon."

I headed straight for the executive elevators. I needed to see Brandon.Now.


As the elevator doors closed, I leaned against the wall, trying to organize my thoughts. We looked alike? Was that why Brandon had been attracted to me? Was I just a replacement for the woman his family wanted him to marry? Had our entire relationship been built on some twisted attempt to recreate what he'd lost?

*Stop it*, I told myself firmly. *You're jumping to conclusions. Just talk to him before you spiral.*

But the seed of doubt had been planted. I thought about all those times people had commented on how unusual it was for Brandon to be interested in someone like me. Had they been trying to tell me something?

The elevator dinged, and the doors slid open. I stepped out, still lost in
my thoughts, and collided hard with someone. The cookie bag flew from my hands, scattering across the floor.

"I'm so sorry. I wasn't looking " I started, then froze.

It was like looking into a mirror, but not quite. The woman had my height.my build. even similar facial features. But her hair was longer, her makeup more dramatic, and her expression was one of complete shock.

"You..." she breathed, taking a small step back.

I recovered first, frantically trying to regain my composure.

"Ms. York!" I exclaimed, my voice coming out stronger than I felt.

Her eyebrows rose. "You know who I am?"

I straightened my shoulders. "Not just anyone can come up to the 27th floor where CEO Brandon Stark works. And while Mr. Stark has several secretaries, I'm at least familiar with most Stark Group employees.You're the only face I don't recognize." I smiled slightly. "I heard that yesterday,Mr. William Stark personally brought in a MIs. York to work as an intern secretary. I was away on business yesterday and didn't have the pleasure of meeting you immediately."

I studied her face, noting her discomfort. "Are you feeling unwell, Ms.York?"

"No!" she replied quickly.

"That's good to hear," I said pleasantly, extending my hand. "Summer Taylor, from the project department."

"Pleased to meet you, Miss Taylor," she replied, taking my hand briefly.Her eyes flickered to my left hand, lingering on the wedding ring Brandon had given me. "Miss Taylor.., are you married?"
? ###Chapter 297: Are You Here to Question Me

Summer's POV

A cold smile curved my lips. "Indeed. Ms. York. How observant of you to notice my wedding ring! I've been married for quite some time now.yet hardly anyone at the office has paid attention to it. You must have quite an eye for detail."


I watched as the color drained from her face. She looked almost ghostly now, her perfectly made-up face unable to conceal her shock.

"Are you sure you're feeling alright, Ms. York?" I pressed, my voice dripping with false concern. "You look terribly pale. It would be such a shame if you fell ill on your very first day. That wouldn't reflect well on Stark Group's image, would it?"

"You..." she began, seemingly struggling to find words. I could practically see the thoughts racing behind her eyes-confusion, disbelief,perhaps even anger.Whatever information she'd been given about me clearly didn't match the reality standing before her.

"Oh my, look at the time!" I exclaimed, glancing at my watch. "Chatting with you has been so distracting, I almost forgot I came up here to see Brandon about some urgent business. You'll have to excuse me."

Without waiting for her response, I stepped around her and headed toward Brandon's office, the remains of my shattered cookies clutched in one hand. I could feel her eyes boring into my back as I walked away.




Standing outside Brandon's office door, I took a deep breath and tried to steady my nerves. My heart was still racing from the encounter with Lyanna.Seeing her-seeing us-side by side had been jarring in a way I hadn't anticipated. Brandon had warned me about her return, but he'd
conveniently left out the part where we could practically be twins.

I knocked on the door, more firmly than usual.

"Who is it?" Brandon's voice called from inside.

"Brandon, it's me! Summer from the project department!" I called back. my voice sounding unnaturally formal even to my own ears.


"Come in!"

I pushed the door open and stepped inside. Brandon was at his desk.absorbed in some document. When he looked up and saw me,he immediately set down his pen and rose to his feet. His eyes fell to the crushed cookie bag in my hands, and his brow furrowed slightly.

"What brings you up here?" he asked, then his expression shifted as he read something in my face. "You've met her."

It wasn't a question.

I remained standing just inside the doorway, not moving closer when he approached.When he reached for me, I took a deliberate step back. His hand hung awkwardly in the air for a moment before dropping to his side.

"Are you here to question me?" he asked quietly, resignation in his voice.

"Should I be?" I countered, my voice cooler than I intended.

Brandon sighed, running a hand through his hair. "You're upset. I get it.But think about it-right now, I'm clearly in the wrong here. Doesn't that give you the upper hand? Why not take advantage of that?"

I almost laughed at his attempt to lighten the mood. Instead, I held out the crushed bag of cookies.

"These were for you," I said flatly. "They're yours to eat, even if they're
Cuapter 297.A0 00co ueston e:

broken now."

Brandon took the bag. looking down at the crumbled contents."What happened?"


"I bumped into your ex-fiancée. Literally." I crossed my arms over my chest. "Why didn't you tell me that we look exactly alike, Brandon?"

When he didn't immediately answer. I felt something crack inside me."Brandon,answer me!"


"What kind of answer are you looking for?" he asked, his voice measured."Yes, there's a resemblance between you two, but you're not identical. Not by a long shot."

His eyes locked with mine, unflinching. "Why not just ask what you really want to know? Did I mnarry you because you look like her? Because you were a convenient replacement when she wasn't available?"

I felt my throat tighten. That was exactly the question burning inside me,the fear that had taken root the moment I'd seen her face.

"I thought I made myself clear yesterday," Brandon continued. "I told you not to believe anything anyone else says. Remember?'

"What about what you say?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper."Cana I believe that?"


"Do you trust me?"

I stared at him, caught off guard by his directness. "I don't know how to answer that question. What I need to know is whether you married me just for me-not because I reminded you of someone else."

The corner of Brandon's mouth lifted in a slight smile. "Just for you. Only for you."
I wanted to believe him. God. how I wanted to believe him.

"Fine." I said finally. "I'll trust you on this. But if this is a lie, make it a lifetime one. If you can't keep up the pretense forever, just tell me the truth now. I'm not the type to cling to someone who doesn't want me.You know that,right?"

"I know," he said simply.

I nodded and turned to leave, but Brandon caught my arm.

"Everyone seems to think you two are identical," he said softly. "What about you? Do you see yourself in her?"

I met his gaze steadily. "No."

"Exactly," he replied, his grip on my arm relaxing. "You should know,Summer-I would never compromise myself for anyone. If I had felt anything for Lyanna, I wouldn't have married you or stayed with you all this time. You're not a replacement for anyone. And no one could ever replace you."

"You'd better remember what you said today," I warned him, though the ice in my voice was beginning to thaw.

"I will," he promised. "Fo the rest of my life. Some things can't be seen with your eyes-they need to be felt with your heart."

"I'll try," I told him honestly. "But I'm only human, Brandon. Don't lie to me."

Outside Brandon's office, I leaned against the wall and closed my eyes,trying to steady my breathing. The encounter with Lyanna,followed by the confrontation with Brandon, had left me emotionally drained. I needed a moment to compose myself before heading back to my own department.
Deep breath in. Deep breath out.

I'd handled things better than I'd expected. No tears, no shouting, no emotional breakdown. I'd stood my ground and spoken my mind. Yet the image of Lyanna's face-so eerily similar to my own-lingered in my thoughts.

We're not the same person. I reminded myself firmly. I am Summer.She is Lyanna. And Brandon chose me.


With one final deep breath, I pushed myself away from the wall and headed toward the elevators. Whatever game William Stark was playing by bringing Lyanna back, I wasn't about to let it break what Brandon and I had built together.

As the elevator doors closed, I caught a glimpse of Lyanna watching me from down the hallway, her expression unreadable. I straightened my shoulders and held her gaze until the doors slid shut between us.

The battle lines had been drawn. And I had no intention of retreating.
###Chapter 298: Once and For All

Summer's POV

I made my way back to my desk, still shaken from my encounter with Lyanna. My mind was racing with a thousand thoughts, but I forced myseIf to focus on work. I needed normalcy right now-something solid to ground me.

Her face-a face so eerily similar to mine it was unsettling. What was William Stark's game here? Was Brandon telling me the truth, or was I just a convenient replacement?

No. I told myself firmly. Brandon married me. He chose me. Whatever Lyanna was to him before, I'm his wife now.

But doubt had already takenroot,growing like a weed in the garden of my mind. I trusted Brandon-I did-but I didn't trust anyone ese in this equation. Not William Stark, not the company gossips, and certainly not Lyanna York.

I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes, trying to clear my head.

"Summer? Are you okay? You seem weird today."

I opened my eyes to find Heather standing over me, concern etched on her face.

"I'm fine," I lied, straightening up. "Just didn't get much sleep last night."

Heather set a stack of papers on my desk. "Leo asked me to bring you these data reports."

"Thanks," I said, reaching for them half-heartedly.

Instead of leaving, Heather perched on the edge of my desk, leaning in conspiratorially. "So. what's the deal with you and our CEO? Everyone
saw you arrive together this morning."

I bit back a sigh. The last thing I neededI right now was more gossip. "It's exactly whatit looks like."

"Come on," she pressed. "Are you related to the Stark family or something?And what about that Lyanna woman?"

Mdy head snapped up. "Stop right there. I have absolutely nothing to do with Lyanna York."

Heather's eyes widened at my sharp tone.

I softened slightly. "As for Brandon and me... you can draw your own conclusions."




By the end of the day, I was mentally exhausted. As I packed up my things, my phone rang. Brandon.

"Hey," I answered, tucking the phone between my ear and shoulder as I gathered my papers.

"Dinner tonight?" he asked. "I was thinking we could try that new place in SoHo."

I was about to agree when I spotted Lyanna standing near the building entrance, clearly watching for me. A mix of irritation and determination surged through me.

"Actually, I don't think I can make it tonight," I said, my eyes locked on Lyanna's figure. "I have plans with a... friend. You'll have to handle dinner on your own tonight."

There was a pause on the other end. "Everything okay?"
"Everything's fine." I assured him. "Til see you later at home."

I hung up and made my way towvard the entrance,steeling myself for whatever confrontation awaited me.


Lyanna straightened as I approached, forcinga smile that didn't reach her eyes.


"Was that Brandon on the phone?" she asked the moment I was within earshot.


I matched her forced smile with one of my own, though mine contained an edge of ice. "That was my husband."

Her smile faltered, a flash of something-anger? pain?-crossing her features before she recovered. "Brandon's so inconsiderate. Getting married without telling me. William was complaining just the other day thateven he didn't know about Brandon's marriage."

My smile dimmed slightly, but I kept it firmly in place. "Brandon believes marriage is a private matter between two people. He said we'd inform all the relatives when we hod our official wedding ceremony. By the way, Ms.York. are you Brandon's sister or something?”

Lyanna's perfectly arched eyebrows rose. "My last name is York."

"Exactly," I pressed. "So why are you making it like you are a Stark?"

Lyanna shifted uncomfortably, "You probably don't know this, Ms. Taylor,but theYork and Stark families have been close for generations. Brandon and I grew up together-,"

"Of course," I said dismissively, "Names are just labels, after all. Whether you call me Ms. Taylor or Mrs. Stark-I don't really mind either way."

Lyanna's face tightened. "I wouldn't want to cause confusion by calling
you Mrs. Stark when your marriage isn't public knowledge yet."

"Feel free to make it public if you'd like," I countered smoothly. "So, did you want to grab dinner or just coffee?"

When Lyanna remained silent,clearly thrown by my directness, I decided to press my advantage.

"You know what? Manhattan has changed so much since you've been gone-everything's different now. People, places,things-they all change.Since you might not recognize much anymore, why don't I show you around? I know this city like the back of my hand."

Lyanna hesitated before accepting with obvious reluctance. "That would be.
..nice. Thank you, Ms. Taylor."

"It's no trouble at all," I replied, my voice dripping with false graciousness."I'm Brandon's wife, it's only proper that I play hostess. Brandon's so busy these days, he might not have time to show you around properly.Feel free to come to me anytime.




Thirty minutes later, I was driving my bright red Ferrari down Park Avenue with Lyanna in the passenger seat. The car was Brandon's, of course-a trophy from some ridiculous bet with Sean-but he often let me drive it.

I could feel Lyanna's eyes on me, assessing everything from my driving to the way I tucked my hair behind my ear. In her mind, I knew she was comparing us: me, the bold, outspoken woman who'd seemingly appeared from nowhere to capture Brandon, versus her, the woman with history and family connections.

"So,where would you like to go?" I asked, breaking the tense silence.
"Fifth Avenue," she replied after a moment. "Have you heard of it?"

I bit back a sarcastic response. "Of course. Everyone knows Fifth Avenue."

Ladjusted our route, heading toward the iconic shopping street.

"Is there a restaurant you like there?" I asked.

"I used to go there often with Brandon.,." shepaused, "and other friends.f'd like to see it again."

I kept my expression neutral, though internally I was counting backward from ten to maintain my composure.

"You know," Lyanna continued, her voice taking on a nostalgic tone,"growing up with Brandon, we went everywhere together. I remember he used to love-"

I maintained my speed and my smile, appearing completely unaffected by her obvious attempt to get under my skin.

Lyanna stopped mid-sentence, suddenly studying my face."You... don't mind?"

I couldn't help but laugh. "Mind what, exactly?"

"I mean..." she stammered,clearly thrown by my reaction.

I decided to drop the pretense, just for a moment. "Actually, I do mind. A lot. Though I'm part of every minute of his life now, I wasn't there for his past. Sometimes I wish I'd known him from birth, been tied to his side from the beginning. Then people with questionable intentions wouldn't be able to get close to him." I met her eyes directly. "That would solve everything once and for all, wouldn't it?"
###Chapter 299: var Between Two vvomen

Summer's POV

When I pulled up in front of a cozy storefront with "SCARLETTS" above the door. Lyanna's confusion was evident.

"Mrs. Stark, are you sure this is the right place?" she asked, frowning."This isn't Fifth Avenue."

I turned to her with my brightest smile. "Oh, Ms. York, I'm afraid you've been away too long. That street has been completely redesigned. The restaurant you mentioned doesn't exist anymore."

"But-"

"I can't blame you for not knowing," I continued, my voice dripping wíth artificial sweetness. "New York changes so quickly. But of course, you wouldn't know that since you've been in Mexico all this time."

I saw her stiffen at the mention of Mexico. So Brandon had told me the truth about where she'd been.

"This is myfriend's coffee shop," I explained. "The atmosphere is lovely.I think you'll like it."

Lyanna studied the facade. "A coffee shop? Mrs. Stark, I didn't know you were interested in coffee."

"I know a thing or two," I replied modestly. "Both my grandfathers taught me to appreciate coffee and tea. Especially Professor Thompson."

For a fraction of a second, I caught genuine surprise in her eyes. She hadn't known about my connection to Professor Thompson. Score one for me.
Inside.Scarlett was at the counter when she spotted us. Her face lit up.then froze in obvious shock when her gaze landed on Lyanna.

"Scarlett!" I called out. "It's been forever!"

Scarlett's eyebrows shot up as she looked between us. "Summer, it's been ages! And this is... your sister?"

"Scarlett, this is my colleague Lyanna York. She just started at Stark Group yesterday. Ms. York isn't too familiar with New York anymore,so I thought I'd show her around."

"Do you have a private room available?" I asked.

"For you? Always," Scarlett replied, though I could see the questions in her eyes. "This way, ladies."

As we followed her, Scarlett couldn't help adding, "If I didn't know Summer so well, I'd honestly think you two were sisters. The resemblance is uncanny!"

"Is it?" I replied innocently. "I thöught the same thing when I first met Ms.York! If I didn't know my mom only had Victoria and me, I'd seriously wonder if we were related somehow!"

The comment hung in the air, loaded with implications only I fually understood. Since learning I wasn't Richard and Elizabeth's biological daughter, the question of my true parentage had haunted me. Now,faced with someone who could be my twin... I couldn't help but wonder if our resemblance was more than coincidence.

Scarlett led us to a private room, then asked me to check out some new coffee beans she'd received.

Once we were safely outof earshot, Scarlett grabbed my arm. "What the hell, Summer? Who is that woman and why does she look exactly like you?
I pualled my arm free. "One question at a time, Scarlett."

"So who is she?" Scarlett pressed.

I took a deep breath.′′Lyanna York. Brandon's ex-fiancée,"

Scarlett's jaw dropped. "Ex-what? Are you serious?" Her eyes widened with concern. "Summer, this isn't normal. Does it not bother you that your husband's ex looks exactly like you?"


"Of course it bothers me," I admitted. "But Brandon told me to trust him."

"And you're just... okay with that? There's not a single part of you that's worried?"


"How could I not be?" I said, keeping my voice low. "But what am I supposed to do? Brandon and I are already married. If he really married me just because I reminded him of Lyanna, then now that she's back, he could easily divorce me and be with her. But he hasn't."

I believed what I was saying, but deep down, I wasn't worried about Brandon as much as I was concerned about the Stark family. William Stark had made it clear he didn't approve of me, and bringing Lyanna back was obviously his attempt to drive a wedge between us.

Scarlett's eyes narrowed. "He hasn't left you yet, fine. But why is she working at Stark Group? William Stark's doing?"

I nodded reluctantly.

"That manipulative old man!" Scarlett scoffed. "Even I'm getting angry,and I'm usually pretty chill. And here you are, casually bringing her to my coffee shop? What's your angle?"

"Know your enemy," I replied simply. "She sought me out today. If I had
refused. I'd look insecure. I'm Brandon's wife now-why should I fear her?
"

Scarlett grinned. "Look at you, finally growing a backbone."

"She's not even a real rival." I said with more confidence than I felt.




When we returned to the private room, Lyanna was expertly brewing coffee at the small preparation station. Her movements were precise and practiced,revealing years of training.

"Mrs. Stark, please try this," she said, offering me a cup. "Brandon always loved my coffee."

I accepted it with a smile. "The aroma is lovely. Ms. York, you have quite the skill."

Lyanna dipped her head modestly. "My family arranged for professional baristas to teach me from a young age. I'm reasonably proficient, but far from the best."

"Interesting," I replied. "My grandfather Professor Thompson always says,Don't strive to be the best-strive to be better than the best."

Lyanna stiffened, "Your grandfather?"

"Yes, my grandfather Jonathan Thompson from Columbia Business School,"
I confirmed. "He was Brandon's mentor. Since you and Brandon are so close, I assumed you'd know him."

Her face paled slightly. "No, I... I don't."

"Really? I suppose that makes sense," I mused. "Brandon skipped several grades. When he was in college, you and I must have been about the same age-still in elementary school, right?"
Lyanna's smile became strained. "I suppose so. I was... in WVashington then."

"That explains it." I nodded. "Brandon was my grandfather's star pupil.Grandfather always said Brandon was brilliant-even upperclassmen couldn't match his intellect."


I began preparing my own coffee. "I learned this craft from my grandfather. Brandon's tasting classes were also taught by him. Have you ever tried Brandon's coffee. Ms. York?"


"No." she admitted. looking increasingly uncomfortable.

I smiled, sensing victory. "I have. His technique is nearly identical to mine-we had the same teacher, after all. Would you like to try some of mine?"


As I prepared the coffee, I couldn't resist driving my point home. "My grandfather always said different beans and water temperatures produce entirely different flavors. The equipment and extraction methods matter tremendously. When two elements come together, they must be compatible-that compatibility is essential."

I handed her the finished cup, my message clear. "Please, Ms. York,try it."

Our eyes met as she accepted the cup, and in that moment,we both understood: this was just the opening move in our game.
###Chapter 300: Did You Have Some Secret
Crush on Me for Years?

Summer's POV

Lyanna York studied me intently, her eyes scanning every detail of my face. This was the second time today-first in Brandon's office, now in Scarlett's coffee shop. I could see her reassessing whatever assumptions she d made about me, surprised to find that I might be more than just a pretty face that resembled hers.

I handed her the freshly brewed coffee with a pleasant smile. "Every new experience deserves a chance, don't you think? Or is Ms. York so accustomed to her own coffee that she won't even try someone else's?"

"Why so aggressive, Ms. Taylor?" Lyanna laughed, though her fingers tightened around the cup. "It's just coffee, after all."

She took a delicate sip. Her expression remained composed, but I caught the slight tightening around her eyes.

"Well?" I prompted.

"It's... quite good," she replied, setting the cup down firmly. She didn't take another sip.

Lyanna smoothed her skirt. "I should apologize. I simply wanted to become friends. After all, Brandon and I were once..." She paused. "Well,we may not be a couple anymore, but we're still friends."

She leaned forward. "Besides, we look so similar. That must mean something, right? I was just... curious about you. Nothing more."

"Me too," I replied smoothly. "You're Brandon's friend, and I'm simply being a good host to Ms. York. Isn't that what a wife should do?"
Frustration flickered across her face. She glanced at her watch and stood abruptly.

"The Stark mansion isn't far from here," she said, gathering her purse."That's where I'm staying. William wanted to arrange a driver for me,but I declined."


"I'd be happy to drive you," I offered, knowing she would refuse. The last place I wanted to go was the Stark mansion, where William would undoubtedly take pleasure in belittling me in front of her.

"That won't be necessary," she replied. "I could use the fresh air."

I maintained my polite smile until she disappeared down the street. Only then did I allow myself a satisfied smirk as I returned to making coffee.




I was so absorbed in brewing that I barely registered the soft knock at the door. When I looked up, Brandon was already inside, his tall figure moving with effortless grace. He had his suit jacket draped over one arm,his tie loosened just enough to hint at the end of a long workday.

He settled into the chair beside me, watching me work. I continued grinding the beans, acutely aware of his eyes tracking my every movement.

"How long were you eavesdropping, Mr. Stark?" I asked without looking up.

Surprise flickered in his eyes before his lips curved into that half-smile I loved. He accepted the coffee I handed him. "Care to guess?"

"What,were you worried I might bully your old acquaintance?" I teased.


Brandon nodded without hesitation. "Yes."

I punched his chest lightly. "You're actually admitting it? Aren't you afraid
I'll get mad?"

Brandon caught my hand in his. "I know my wife can't be bullied by anyone. She's the one who does the bullying-no one gets to push her around."

I tried to pull my hand away. "I don't believe a word you're saying."

"What would it take to convince you?" he asked, recapturing my hand.

"Nothing short of cutting your heart out and showing it to me," I replied.

Brandon's voice dropped to that intimate tone that always made me shiver.
"I would, if that's what it took."

I wiggled my fingers against his palm. "I'd like to see that. But even then,
I probably couldn't tell what's in it."

"I don't trust you alone," he admitted suddenly. "Also, I'm starving."

"You haven't eaten?" I exclaimed, suddenly realizing I hadn't either.

Brandon stood, tugging me to my feet. "Let's go."

We nearly bumped into Scarlett on our way out.

"Leaving already?" she asked.

"Yes," Brandon replied. "Sorry for the intrusion."

"No trouble at all. Drop by anytime."

Once we were in the car, I turned to Brandon.

"When did you and Lyanna York first meet?" I asked.

He hesitated. "I don't remember."
"How could you not remember? Wasn't she your fiancée?"

Brandon sighed. "Whotold you she was my fiancee?"

"She's not?" I asked, confused. "But today she implied..."

"Would you rather people believe one misunderstanding or many different ones?" Brandon asked carefully. "Sometimes one clean lie is better than a dozen messy truths. Understand?"

I shook my head. "Not really, no."

"Then never mind," he said.

A thought struck me. "Wait, were you using her?"

Brandon's eyebrows shot up. "You finally figured it out?"

"You used Lyanna to keep other women away?" The pieces started falling into place. "But Lyanna herself was interested in you, wasn't she? If we hadn't met, if there hadn't been some misunderstanding between you two...she might be Mrs.Stark right now."

Brandon flicked my forehead gently.

"Ow!" I protested. "You hit me!"

"Lyanna was useful in that regard," Brandon continued,ignoring my complaint. "Beyond that, there was nothing between us."

"Really?" I pressed. "There was nothing else with Lyanna?"

Brandon's eyes met mine. "If I had felt anything for her, would you be here right now?"

His answer was simple but powerfu1. If Brandon had truly wanted Lyanna,we wouldn't be married.
"Summer," he said suddenly, "do you remember when you were a kid.maybe fifteen years ago, falling from a tree and landing on someone?"

His question hit me like a bolt oflightning,Something about it resonated deep inside me, making my chest tighten.

"What...?" I whispered.




That night. I lay awake in bed, turning Brandon's strange question over and over in my mind. Had I fallen from a tree as a child? I vaguely remembered climbing trees at my grandparents' estate, but falling? And landing onsomeone? The memory hovered just beyond my reach.

Brandon emerged from the bathroom and found me staring at the ceiling.He sat beside me, using a towel to gently dry my still-damp hair.

"I feel like I've forgotten something important," I confessed. "But I can't remember what I've forgotten."

I twisted to look up at him. "Brandon, did you know me before? Did you have some secret crush on me for years?"

Brandon leaned down, brushing his lips against my nose."What do you think?"

I pushed at his chest, laughing despite my frustration. "I'm not guessing.Everyone thinks you're this untouchable ice prince, but I know better. You're just a wolf in sheep's clothing!"

In one smooth motion, Brandon wrapped his arm around me and pulled me against his chest. His fingers found my nose, pinching it lightly.

"Say that again," he challenged, his eyes dancing with mischief.

I couldn't heIp but smile back, even as the mystery of our possible shared
past continued to nag at me. Whatever secrets Brandon was keeping.I was determined to uncover them but for now. I was content to be exactly where I was.
###Chapter 301: Wish Me Luck

Summer's POV

For the past few days. Brandon had been picking me up and dropping me off at work, which had predictably set the Stark Group rumor mill on fire.Every morning when we pulled up in his Bentley,heads would turn.whispers would start. and by the time I reached my floor, it felt like the entire building had somehow witnessed our arrival.

I caught the tail end of a conversation as I passed the break room on my way to my office.

I rolled my eyes and kept walking. If they only knew I was already his wife, not just his "property." But honestly, I had bigger things to worry about than office gossip. The Manhattan west project was consuming most of my working hours, and rumors about William Stark visiting the company today weren't helping my concentration.

Leo and I had just returned from a meeting when Heather practically ambushed me at my desk, her eyes wide with excitement.

"Summer!" she hissed, grabbing my arm and pulling me aside."You have to tell me what's going on. Everyone's talking about you and Brandon! I thought you said you were married?" Her eyes darted to my wedding ring,her expression a mixture of confusion and burning curiosity.

I smiled and gently removed her hand from my arm. "What do you think is going on between me and Brandon?"

"Come on!" Heather whined. "We're supposed to be friends! Everyone's saying you're Brandon's new fling, but they don't know you're already married!" She glanced down at my ring and her eyes widened even further."Wait... that ring... don't tell me you're actualy married to our CEO?"

"Hmm," I hummed, enjoying her shock. "Took you long enough to figure
it out."

"What do you mean took me long enough'? You never told me!" Heather's voice rose to a near-squeak. "You're seriously married to Brandon Stark?You're not messing with me? But your ring is so... simple."

"Well, now you know." I said with finality. "And I really need to get back to work,okay?"

Heather opened her mouth to protest, but I was already turning back to my computer.

As much as I tried to focus on my work, William Stark's visit to the company lingered in the back of my mind. I wasn't naive-I knew exactly why he was here. Another attempt to push his Lyanna agenda,no doubt.

"Summer, come in here a minute!" Leo called from his office.

I grabbed my tablet and hurried over. "What's up?"

Leo handed me a thick folder. "Take these files to the twenty-seventh floor.Brandon requested them ASAP."

I stared at the folder, my stomach tightening slightly. "Can't you just send someone else? I'm in the middle of the Fortune proposal."

"He specifically asked for you," Leo replied with a knowing smirk.

I sighed and took the folder, "Fine,"

The elevator ride to the twenty-seventh floor felt shorter than usual. When the doors opened, I put on my professional face and headed toward Brandon's office.

James was just stepping out when I arrived. His eyes widened slightly when he saw me.
"Mrs. Stark!" he exclaimed, then immediately looked around to make sure no one had heard.

"You might want to stick with my name while we're at the office." I reminded him. "Is Brandon in?"

"Yes, but..." Jamnes hesitated, his usual composure slipping. "William is in there with him."

I raised an eyebrow. "I see. We11, I can just give you these files for Brandon and head back downstairs."

"Miss Summer!" James called as I turned to leave. "There's also... someone else inside."

"Lyanna?" I guessed, reading his uncomfortable expression.

James looked startled. "How did you know?"

"Your face gave it away," I said with a slight smile. "Are you surprised I'm not throwing a fit?"

"You're not... upset?" he asked carefully.

"Of course I'm upset," I admitted. "How could I not be when someone else is monopolizing my husband's time? But what am I supposed to do about it?"

James studied me for a moment.′′Bythe way, William's birthday is this weekend. The Stark family always makes a big production of it. He likes having everyone there."

"I bet he does," I muttered. "Nothing like a chaotic family gathering to stir up more drama."

I glanced at Brandon's closed office door, weighing my options. I could turn around and avoid William and Lyanna altogether,or I could walk in
there anid face them head-on.

Running away wasn't my style.

"Wish me luck," I said to James. then pushed the door open without knocking.

Brandon was at his desk, focused on his computer screen. William and Lyanna sat in the small seating area to the right, where Lyanna appeared to be preparing tea for the older man. All three looked up when I entered.

Brandon's expression softened almost imnperceptibly when he saw me-a change so subtle that only someone who knew him well would notice.

"Do you need something?" he asked, his voice professionally neutral.

"Leo asked me to bring you these files," I replied, walking over and placing the folder on his desk.

Brandon glanced at the documents. "Leo's getting more efficient. I just mentioned this two days ago and he's already delivered. How are the negotiations going?"

"We're almost there," I reported. "Once the first round of funding comes through, we can get started. Edward's not available, but Landon is helping out. He seems pretty capable."

"Good," Brandon nodded, pulling another file from his drawer and handing it to me. "Give this to Leo. Tell him to start as soon as possible-this project has been delayed long enough."

"If that's a11, I'll head back down, Mr. Stark," I said, turning to leave without acknowledging the other two people in the room.

"Wait!" William's sharp voice stopped me at the door.

I paused, my hand on the doorknob. "Were you speaking to me.Mr.Stark?
William's face tightened with irritation. "Who else would I be talking to, a ghost?"

"I wasn't sure," I replied with a polite smile. "What can I do for you?"

"You-" William started. but I cut him off.

"Aren't you familiar with Stark Group protocols?" I asked innocently. "Not just anyone is allowed on the twenty-seventh floor."

I glanced at Brandon, who had returned his attention to his work.deliberately ignoring the brewing confrontation.

"I'm well aware of company protocols," I continued. "I'm here because Brandon requested these files. If he wants me to leave, I'll go immediately."I turned to Lyanna. "But speaking of protocols, Ms. York, isn't it true that only Brandon's éxecutive assistant and his chief of staff are normally allowed in his office? With all these confidential documents around,security is important. Wouldn't you agree?"

Lyanna's composure slipped for a moment. "Yes, that's correct."

"See?" I said with a bright smile. "Ms. York knows the rules so well already, and she's only been here a few days! So, Ms. York, what's supposed to happen to people who know the rules butbreak them anyway?"

William's face flushed with anger. "How dare you!"

"I wouldn't dare,"I replied smoothly."It's still working hours, after all.Was there anything else you needed, Mr. Stark? If not, I should get back to work. Unlike some people, I actually have to earn my paycheck to support myself and my man. We can't all be so fortunate."
William looked like he might burst a blood vessel. Lyanna sat frozen,her hand still holding the teapot.

I could feel Brandon watching me now. and when I glanced at him.I caught the ghost of a smile tugginig at his lips.

"That will be all. Ms. Taylor," he said. dismissing me with a nod.


I walked out with my head held high.feeling William's glare burning into my back the entire way.
###Chapter 302: What's Mine Is Yours

Summer's POV

My phone buzzed as I went back to my desk.

"Hello?" I answered, already smiling.

"It's me!" Brandon's voice carried a hint of exasperation.

"I know," I laughed. "What's up? Was something wrong with those files?"

"No, nothing wrong. After work, come with me to Christie's auction house."

"Sure! But I might be running late. These projections are kicking my butt."

"I'll wait for you," he said, his tone softening.

After hanging up, I attacked my work with renewed focus, determined not to keep him waiting. For three hours straight, I didn't leave my desk once,even skipping my coffee break despite Leo's concerned glances.

By 5:15, I'd finished everything. I texted Brandon:*I ffinished early!Meeting you at the parking garage in ten.*

His immediate reply was predictably brief: *Good.*

Typical Brandon-few words, maximum impact. I caught myself analyzing his single-word response. Was he pleased? Annoyed? The fact that I still obsessed over his texts was slightly embarrassing.

Heading toward the executive garage, I froze when I heard voices around the corner. Brandon's unmistakable tone was countered by a woman's voice-honeyed and insistent-that made my stomach drop.

"Brandon, we don't have to be like this," Lyanna was saying. "You know when I left-"
"I don't care about your business, Lyanna," Brandon cut her off, his voice ice-cold. "I've already done more than enough for you. More than you deserve."

I pressed against the wall, barely breathing. Listen first, decide later.

"But Brandon," Lyanna continued, her voice dropping intimately, "are you really throwing away what we had? When you married Summer, wasn't it because of me?"


My heart skipped painfully. I clutched my purse tighter, fighting the urge to either storm out or flee.

Brandon's laugh was harsh. "Because of you? That's why I married Summer?"

"I know you're angry about how I left New York," Lyanna pressed. "But you never paid attention to me back then. I just wanted to teach you a lesson, make you realize what we had. I only meant to be gone for a few days-"

"Lyanna," Brandon interrupted, "do you think I don't know everything? I've kept quiet about what happened out of respect for your reputation. As for why you've returned-I'll get to the bottom of it. If you want to stay in New York, think carefully about what you should and shouldn't do."

I heard movement, someone stepping closer.

"But Brandon," Lyanna's voice turned pleading, "you promised to marry me,and now you've married Summer instead. She just has a face like mine.You still love me, don't you? You-"

"Who's there?" Brandon's voice cut through the tension.

Taking a deep breath, I stepped around the corner. "It's me."
They stood by his Bentley-Lyanna reaching for his arm, Brandon rigid with his hands in his pockets. Both turned to look at me.

I bit my lip, annoyed at being caught. Then I remembered-I was his *wife*. I had every right to be here.

"Ms. York seems awfully attached to old flames and ancient history,"I remarked with my brightest smile.

Lyanna's eyebrows arched. "Ms. Taylor enjoys listening to private conversations."

"Private?" I laughed. "This is Brandon's parking area. Employees aren't allowed here without permission. Maybe you haven't learned the rules yet?"

"What about you? Àren't you just another employee?"

"I'm a Stark employee during office hours, but it's after five now. More importantly, I'm Brandon's wife. What's his is mine." I glanced at my wedding ring. "People tend to flaunt what they lack. Luckily, I don't lack a husband or a ring." I tapped my chin. "Though honey, my ring could use a few more diamonds:"

"Tll buy you some tomorrow," Brandon replied instantly.

"I want them as big as possible."

"Done."

Lyanna's composure cracked. "Aren't you being inappropriate,Ms.Taylor?"

I turned to Brandon. "Am I being inappropriate? Is asking my husband for diamonds crossing a line?"

"Not at all. You can have any diamonds you want."

"I was Brandon's fiancée once," Lyanna said, her face reddening. "Is this
necessary?"

"I don't lack anything, so I have no interest in what belongs to others,"I replied. "I might not be talented in many areas, but I excel at protecting what's mine. If someone tries to steal from me?" I smiled, showing teeth."They'll find I'm not so nice."

"Nostalgia is wonderful, but the world changes. What you thought was eternal often just hasn't reached its expiration date. When it does,you realize nothing lasts forever. Only the present matters."

I looped my arm through Brandon's. "Right now, he's mine. And my face came from my parents, not you. If Brandon only cared about appearance,you wouldn't be the ex."

Without letting her respond, I practically shoved Brandon towvard the car,then slipped into the passenger seat. We drove away,leaving Lyanna standing alone.

Once on the road, Brandon watched me with amusement, one arm propped against the window.

"What?" I demanded. "Are you upset I was rude to your precious Lyanna?



"Upset about what?"

"You're not mad I acted like a jealous maniac?"

"Why would I be?" he asked, looking entertained.

"Brandon, what's really going on with Lyanna?"

"What do you think?" he countered.

"I don't know, and that's the problem," I sighed. "If you're going to lie to me, make it a lifelong lie. I'm not the type to cling to someone who doesn't


"I know."

"Some things need to wait." he said, his expression serious. "The timing isn't right yet."

"When will it be?" I asked. "I'm just a normal woman. I overthink things.I get jealous. I can't promise I won't do something stupid if this keeps dragging on."

Brandon took my hand. "Give me a little more time. Once I've finished my investigation. I'll tell you everything. Trust me?"

I exhaled."Fine."

We drove in silence before I remembered our plans. "So, Christie's-are we picking out å birthday gift for William? James mentionedI it was coming up.



"James told you?" Brandon asked, surprised.

"Yeah. It's kind of last minute. I haven't had time to prepare."

"If James hadn't reminded me, I would have forgotten completely."

I stared at himn. "What? You're joking,right?"

"Nope."

"What are we getting him? What does he like?"

"Doesn't matter," Brandon shrugged. "The old man doesn't need anything.Besides, do you really think this birthday party is just about celebrating his birth?"

I studied his profile, noticing the tension in his jaw. For all his
nonchalance,William clearly bothered him deeply.

"Why are you looking at me like that?" he asked.

A small smile played at his lips. "Don't waste your sympathy. He genuinely doesn't care about gifts. We'll just pick something appropriate and be done with it."
###Chapter 303: William Stark's Birthday Party

Summer's POV

The cream-colored invitation to William Stark's birthday celebration felt heavy in my hands as I smoothed my fingers over the embossed lettering.Brandon had tossed it onto the coffee table days ago like it was junk mail.but the elaborate card screamed "important" to anyone who knew anything about New York society.

From our car window. I watched Alexander's father gesturing emphatically at the entrance to the Stark mansion, his face flushed with frustration as he argued with the impassive doorman. Alexander stood behind him,shoulders slumped in a suit that seemed a size too large, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else.

"They're trying to get into the inner reception," Brandon explained, barely glancing up from his phone. "Outer reception is for business associates and distant relatives. Inner reception is for William's honored guests."

"And they didn't make the cut?" I asked, unable to hide my satisfaction.

"Apparently not."

The contrast was almost painful to watch-Alexander's father desperate to get inside, while his son withered under the weight of comparing himself to Brandon, the golden heir of the Stark empire.

"We should head in," Brandon said, tucking his phone away. "James is already waiting for us."

His phone rang just as we were about to exit. Brandon answered with a clipped "What is it?"

I could hear Sean's voice even without speakerphone. "Dude, where the hell are you? The party's already started!" His excited tone made me
instantly suspicious.

"What's going on?" Brandon asked, eyes narrowing.

"Oh man. you're going to love this." Sean laughed. "You'll never guess who showed up with an inner reception invitation. It's going to be quite the show today."

Brandon's posture stiffened. "Alexander? Who gave him an invitation?"

"Exactly! How did Alexander-" Sean's voice cut off as Brandon's expression darkened.

"Tll handle it," Brandon said coldly before ending the call.

His eyes met mine with that dangerous glint I'd come to recognize. "Ready?H


I nodded, smoothing down my pale blue silk gown1. We'd spent the afternoon at Brandon's preferred stylist, and the result was worth it-I hardly recognized the elegant woman in the mirror.

James opened my door as we arrived. "Mrs. Stark, Mr. Stark," he greeted with a slight bow. Brandon's hand at the small of my back felt reassuring as James followed with our gift-the antique timepiece from Christie's.

As we approached the entrance, my body tensed. This wasn't just any event-this was my official debut as Brandon's wife in front of the entire Stark family, including Victoria and Alexander.

"Having second thoughts?" Brandon asked quietly.

I shook my head. "No, it's just... some things you have to face eventually."


"Good," he said warmly.

"They're still part of my identity," Iadded,′′nomatter how much I wish
they weren't."

Brandon's fingers tightened slightly. "I know. But we're still going to investigate exactly how they got in."

The walk to the inner reception felt endless. Every few steps,someone approached Brandon-executives, politicians, celebrities-all eager for his attention. Each introduction brought the same reaction when they realized who I was: shock, confusion, then hastily composed politeness.

The whispers followed us everywhere: "Who is she?" "Did Brandon Stark actually get married?" "Why wasn't this announced?"

When we entered the inner reception, a complete silence fell. The room,filled with New York's elite, froze as all eyes turned to us.

Victoria stood with a group of women, her practiced smile faltering when she saw us. Beside her, Alexander looked thunderstruck, his mouth slightly open.

Brandon guided me deeper into the room, his custom black suit the perfect counterpoint to my light dress. I could practically see Alexander's thoughts: *They're perfect together.* The realization must have stung,considering his hasty abandonment of me for Victoria.

"Brandon! It's about time you showed up!" Sean's voice broke the tension. "It's your grandfather's birthday party, and you-the host-are fashionably late?"


Brandon merely raised an eyebrow.

Sean grinned at me. "Mrs. Stark, you look absolutely stunning tonight!"

"Thank you," I smiled back. "You're looking pretty sharp yourself.Dr.Sean."
"Whoa!" Sean laughed. "Complimenting other men right in front of your husband? Bold move, Summer!"

Jesse Turner approached next, immaculate in a navy suit. "Mr. Stark, Mrs.Stark," he greeted with a polite nod. "It's been a while."

"Mr. Turner," I responded warmly.

"Mr. Turner." Brandon echoed, subtly pulling me closer. Despite knowing Jesse was no threat. Brandon's possessive streak was showing.

Around us, whispers intensified: "Brandon Stark married?" "Who is she?""How did something this big stay secret?"

Victoria headed straight for us, champagne in hand. "Summer!" she exclaimed with false enthusiasm. "I can't believe you're here!"

"Likewise," I replied coolly. "I don't recall telling you about my relationship with Brandon.

Victoria's smile tightened. "Well, I'm here with my husband. You remember Alexander is part of the Stark family,right? Really,Summer,you should have told us about the wedding! My brother-in-law-"

"Brother-in-law?" I interrupted. "I think you might have that relationship wrong."

"What do you mean? You're my sister, so Brandon is my brother-in-law.He is your husband,isn't he?"

"Looking at it that way, I suppose you're right," I conceded. "But since Alexander is a Stark family member, according to family hierarchies,you should actually be calling Brandon 'Uncle' and me 'Aunt'. Alexander is quite a few levels below Brandon in the family tree."

Victoria went pale, her fingers tightening around her glass. "I... I had no
idea about your marriage to... Mr. Stark. Besides. Alexander and I married first."

"That's another misunderstanding." I replied smoothly. "Brandon and I were already married when you were still engaged. According to Alexander's position in the Stark family, you should address me as 'Aunt."

"Summer,you-" Victoria sputtered.

"I just don't understand why you wouldn't tell your family," she shifted tactics. "What about Mom and Dad? And Grandpa George? He's always been so good to you!"

"Oh, Grandpa George and Grandfather Thompson both know," I smíled. "We had dinner together to celebrate. I guess you were too busy with your career to know. We haven't held the reception yet, though. You'll definítely be invited. Just make sure your gift is generous."

"O-of course," Victoria managed through gritted teeth. "You're my only sister,after all."

For a moment, I actually pitied her. This Victoria seemed cornered.outmaneuvered by a version of me she'd never encountered before.

As Victoria retreated, Brandon watched me with unmistakable pride.

"Thank you," I said, answering his unspoken compliment.

Lowering my voice, I asked, "Who let Victoria and Alexander in here?"

Before he could answer, James appeared beside us. "Sir, I have the information you requested."

"And?" Brandon prompted.

"It's confirmed,sir,"
Brandon nodded. "Have them detained for now. We'll address it later."

"Yes, sir." James replied, disappearing swiftly.

"What was that about?" I asked.

"Nothing important." Brandon deflected.

"You still haven't told me about Victoria and Alexander," I pressed. "Someone from the Stark family let them in, didn't they?"

"Yes," Brandon confirmed, "but don't worry. They can't touch you. I won't let them."

"I know," I said softly. "But if I'm not doing this right,promise you'll stay beside me."

Brandon's eyes locked with mine, his gaże intense and unwavering."I'll always be by your side:Always."
###Chapter 304 You Won't End Well

Summer's POV

The glittering ballroom of the Stark mansion buzzed with New York's elite as Brandon guided me through the crowd. Every eye tracked our movement. hushed whispers following in our wake. I forced myself to smile despite my aching feet-these designer heels were gorgeous but absolute torture devices.

"You're the center of attention," Brandon murmured, his hand warm against the small of my back.

I maintained my smile while scanning the room. "Not by choice."

After what felt like the hundredth introduction, my face muscles cramped from the forced pleasantries.

Brandon leaned closer. "Tired?"

I nodded slightly. "A bit."

His eyes softened. "Let's take a break. We can find somewhere quieter."

Just as Brandon began steering me toward a less crowded area, a collective gasp rippled through the ballroom. Every head turned toward the entrance,and the crowd parted like the Red Sea.

William Stark had arrived-but it wasn't his entrance that caused the stir.It was Lyanna supporting his arm.

She looked eerily like me-same height, similar facial structure, even her hair styled in a way that mimicked mine. But her eyes held a calculating coldness I recognized immediately.

"Lyanna York," someone whispered nearby.
My body went rigid. Brandon's arm tightened around my waist, his jaw clenching visibly.

"Summer," he said softly. "T'm here."

William's eyes found us in the crowd. a satisfied smirk playing on his lips as he deliberately paraded Lyanna through the room. The message couldn't have been clearer-this was a calculated move designed to humiliate me.

William tapped his cane against the marble floor, commanding attention."Ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to introduce Ms. Lyanna York, Brandon's..."he paused dramatically, "future wife."

A shocked silence fell over the room.

Future wife? What the hell was that supposed to mean? Brandon was already married to me. I bit my lip hard, my fingers digging into Brandon's hand.

Brandon's eyes darkened dangerously, and I could feel the tension radiating from him as he opened his mouth to speak.

Suddenly, a small figure darted through the crowd and latched onto Brandon's leg.

"Daddy!" the child cried, looking up at Brandon with wide,tearful eyes."Daddy!"

The silence in the room became deafening. I felt the blood drain from my face as I stared down at the little boy-maybe four or five years old-clutching Brandon's leg like he belonged there.

"Daddy, why don't you come see Timothy anymore?" the boy wailed, his voice carrying through the stunned ballroom. "You promised you'd visit!"

I couldn't breathe. The room started spinning around me. A child.
Brandon had a child. With her.

I pulled my hand from Brandon's grip, taking an instinctive step back. His face had gone completely blank.

The boy-Timothy-noticed me for the first time and scowled. "Daddy,you don't want Timothy and Mommy anymore because of her?" He tried to push me away. "You're a bad lady!"

Brandon immediately pulled Timothy away. "That's enough."

Timothy's face crumpled, and he began to wail. "Daddy, you don't love me and Mommy anymore?"

I stood frozen, unable to process what was happening. Brandon had a son.
A son he'd never mentioned.

Brandon reached for me again. "Summer,be careful-"

I jerked away from his touch, my eyes cold. "Don't."

"Summer," Brandon said quietly, "you don't believe this, do you?"

I looked at him, this man I'd trusted completely. "You told me never to lie to you1. You said if I had to lie, make sure it was forever so you'd never know. But you-" My voice cracked. "You lied to me, Brandon.You lied about everything."

"Brandon Stark!" Victoria's voice cut through the tension as she pushed forward. "How dare you! How could you do this to my sister?"

"The Stark family has gone too far!" Victoria declared loudly. "First, you marry my sister while having a wife and child waiting at home? And now William Stark parades your mistress around like she's royalty?"

The whispers around us grew louder. Brandon's expression turned murderous.
Victoria turned to the crowd. "That woman is the mother of his child! And my poor sister is being humiliated while Brandon Stark enjoys having both women!"

I'd had enough. I pulled my arm from Victoria's grasp.

"Humiliated? Why should I feel humiliated?" I asked, my voice surprisingly steady. "You're such a caring sister, aren't you?"

Victoria's triumphant expression faltered.

"I am Brandon Stark's legal wife," I continued,my voice growing stronger.
"I am the woman he married in a legal ceremony. Unless, he doesn't want me anymore, or I don't want him anymore, nobody can change that fact!"I turned my gaze directly toward William and Lyanna. "Nobody."

Brandon moved to stand beside me, his expression softening.

"Actually, if you want Brandon anad me to divorce, it's not that difficult." I paused. "It all depends on one thing... whether Brandon wants to divorce me. So if you can convince Brandon to tell me he wants a divorce, I'll agree immediately. But if you can't get Brandon to say it, then you'll find it much harder to get me to agree."

I turned toward Timothy. "Children are innocent. Ms. York, using a child as a bargaining chip... you showed your cards too early, which could be fatal for you."

Lyanna's face paled, "I don't know what you're talking about."

I smiled thinly. "Medical science is quite advanced now, Ms. York. DNA testing is very reliable these days. Have you considered that once you tell one lie, you need countless others to cover it up?"

Lyanna grabbed Timothy's hand. "I'm taking my son and leaving.He's mine alone,"
William stepped forward. "Wait! You are Brandon's future wife, Lyanna."

I laughed softly. "Mr. Stark, are you suggesting your grandson commit bigamy? Or are you trying to force us to divorce?" I raised an eyebrow."Either way, your grandson's position is legally and morally indefensible."

William's eyes narrowed. "Aren't you afraid that this old man will dislike you even more?"

I smiled calmly. "Why should I care if you like me or not? I only need to please one person-Brandon. You've picked the wrong side, Mr. Stark." I turned to Lyanna. "You've chosen the wrong position, Ms. York. Don't you agree?"

Lyanna's face had gone ashen. She looked at Brandon,who stood beside me with the faintest smile on his lips, and something in her expression crumbled.

"Ms. Taylor, you're being too harsh," Lyanna said desperately. "I never intended to break up you and Brandon."

I cut her off with a soft laugh. "I hope you remember what you've said today,Ms.York. If one day you break your word... you won't end well."

Lyanna stared at me, finally understanding the steel beneath my polite smile. She clutched Timothy closer, the boy looking confused as he glanced between Brandon and his mother.
###Chapter305 Forever Be Brandon Stark's Wi

Summer's POV

Lyanna's face was ashen white as she stared at me, her composed facade crumbling. She'd completely underestimated me,thinking I'd fall apart while she swooped in to reclaim Brandon.

"Brandon..," she whispered, tears welling in her eyes. "Please tell Summer that I really... really didn't mean any harm."

Brandon's hand tightened around mine,his grip almost painful.

"Say something," Lyanna pleaded. "After all, if your relationship with her was truly solid, it wouldn't be so easily threatened by me, would it?"

Brandon's expression remained glacial as he cut her off. "I, Brandon Stark,have never loved you, and I have never made any engagement promises to you..."

The room fell completely silent. You could have heard a pin drop.

"Timothy is not my child," Brandon continued firmly. "I have never fathered a child with you or anyone else. My child, when I have one, will only be born to my wife, and my wife..." he paused, his grip on my hand softening, "is only Summer. No one else."

I felt something twist in my chest as he continued.

"If she dies, I will remain alone for the rest of my life; if I I die, she will forever be known only as Brandon Stark's wife."

I looked up at him, forcing a smile that didn't quite reach my eyes.

"Tsk, tsk, Brandon..." a familiar voice broke the tension. "Showing off your love in front of all these people? Not very gentlemanly of you!"
Dr. Sean stepped forward, his usual mischievous grin in place. He winked at me before turning to Brandon.

"Summer." Dr. Sean said, placing a friendly hand on my shoulder, "if this guy ever mistreats you. just tell us, okay? The boys and I will sort him out for you."


Behind him, Michael Sullivan nodded in agreement.

I felt a genuine smile tug at my lips. "Thanks, Sean. I appreciate that."

I turned to Brandon with a playful glint in my eye. "You hear that? No one gets to bully me, not even you. If you do, I'll call Ethan and the others for backup!"

Brandon's expression softened slightly. "If I ever mistreat you,you won't need Ethan to step in. I'll handle the punishment myself."

The tension in the room began to dissipate. I felt exhaustion washing over me.

"I'm tired," I murmured to Brandon. "Can we go home now?"

He nodded immediately. "Of course."

The moment we stepped outside, I wrenched my hand from his grip.I walked quickly toward the waiting car,putting distance between us.

I stopped when I reached his Bentley, turning to face him with a deliberately blank expression. When he reached out to touch my arm,I stepped back.

His arm froze mid-air, confusion flashing across his face.

"The keys," I said flatly.

Brandon didn't move,"Summer--"
"The keys!" I repeated louder. "Since you don't want to leave. give me the keys. I want to go home."

After a moment's hesitation. Brandon unlocked the door. I got in and pulled it shut. effectively shutting him out.

When he got into the driver's seat, I turned away, staring out the passenger window. The silence between us was suffocating.

"Summer-" he began.

"Drive," I cut him off. "I don't want to stay here anymore."

We drove slowly through the city, neither of us speaking. I kept my body angled away from him, refusing to meet his eyes.

When we finally reached The Hamptons, I got out before he'd fully stopped the car. I heard him sigh, followed by the sound of his phone ringing.

By the time Brandon came upstairs, I was standing outside our bedroom door with a pillow and blanket in my arms. I thrust them at his chest.

"You go to the guest room," I said firmly.

Brandon looked surprised. "I thought you would have questions."

"I thought you would have told me the truth," I countered. "But Brandon,you didn't."

His eyes searched mine. "Summer-"

"I don't want to talk to you right now," I interrupted. "I don't even want to be in the same room as you."

Brandon took the bedding, his expression unreadable. "Alright," he said quietly.
As soon as he was gone. I sagged against the wall. Eventually, I pushed myself away and went inato the bedroom,closing the door behind me.

With shaking fingers. I pulled out my phone and dialed Sean's number.

"Well, Summer, what's up with calling me so late?" Sean's voice was relaxed.but understanding.

"Sean. I... need to ask you about Lyanna."

"Whatever you want to know. I'll tell you everything I can."

I took a deep breath. "What was her relationship with Brandon?"

"Three years ago, Lyanna presented herself as Brandon's fiancée. Brandon neither confirmed nor denied it," Sean explained. "William Stark had chosen her. but there was never any official engagement. Brandon allowed the rumors because Lyanna served two purposes-she kept other women away, and she helped him deal with family pressure."

"Why didn't he just deny it?" I asked quietly.

"Two reasons," Sean said. "First, having Lyanna around kept things simple.Second... Lyanna once took a risk to save him."

My chest tightened. "What happened?"

"That's something you should ask Brandon directly," Sean replied gently. "After a certain incident three years ago, Lyanna left New York. Brandon protected her by keeping the whole thing quiet."

"Protected her?" The words felt bitter.

"Summer, sometimes what we see and hear isn't the full truth."

"Then what should I use to know the truth?" I asked frustratedly."Ican't bear that I gave him opportunities to tell me everything, but he didn't."
"Has Brandon been good to you?" Sean asked suddenly.

I fell silent, memories flashing through my mind.

"Brandon has changed a lot since meeting you." Sean continued. "The way he looks at you, talks about you, protects you... we've all noticed. Brandon has never been like this with anyone else. He's really serious about you and you're so special to him, Summer."

I gripped the phone tighter. "Then why didn't he tell me everything?"

"Maybe he was afraid of losing you," Sean suggested. "Brandon, believe it or not, has his own insecurities."

After hanging up, I lay back on the bed, staring at the ceiling.Sean's words echoed in my mind, mingling with the events of the evening.

I needed answers, but I 'also needed time. Tomorrow would be soon enough to confront Brandon.

For now, I just needed to breathe.
###Chapter 306 Go Home

Summer's POV

*Has Brandon been good to you?*

Sean's question kept repeating in my head. Objectively. I knew the answer was yes. Brandon had been more than good to me-he'd been extraordinary. He'd protected me, supported me, chosen me over and over again.

And yet, here I was, feeling like my heart had been ripped out of my chest.

"Fuck," I whispered, pressing the heels of my hands against my eyes.

Rationally, I understood what Sean was trying to tell me. I should trust Brandon,give him the benefit of the doubt. But emotionally? That was a different story. The image of Lyanna standing there with Timothy, calling Brandon "Daddy," was burned into my brain.

I rolled onto my side, hugging a pillow to my chest. The bed felt too big.too empty without Brandon beside me. But I couldn't face him right now.Not when my emotions were this raw.

It was a miracle I'd held it together this long. After everything with Alexander and Victoria, after my parents' betrayal-I thought I was done with surprises.

Sleep eluded me completely. Every time I closed my eyes,I saw Timothy's innocent face looking up at Brandon with complete adoration.




Morning came with painful brightness. I dragged myself out of bed, feeling like I'd been hit by a truck. One glance in the mirror confirmed I looked as bad as I felt-dark circles under my eyes, hair a mess, face pale.
When I stepped into the hallway. Brandon was emergingfrom the guest room at the same time. He looked as exhausted as I felt, his usually impeccable appearance showing signs of a restless night. For a moment,we just stared at each other across the corridor.

He looked away first. his shoulders tense. "Summer-"

"You want to explain?" I cut him off, my voice surprisingly steady.

Brandon's eyes met mine again. "Do you want to hear it?"

"I don't know." I admitted, crossing my arms protectively over my chest."
I don't know what I want right now."

I turned away, heading for the stairs.

"Summer!" Brandon called after me, his voice strained.

I paused at the top of the stairs, not turning around."What?"

"I can explain everything," he said quietly. "If you want to hear it."

I finally looked back at him. "Do you want to tell me?"

"Yes," he said without hesitation. "Buit only if you're feady to listen."

I shook my head, feeling suddenly overwhelmed. "I need some time,"I said, my voice cracking slightly. "I just... I need time,Brandon."

He nodded slowly. "Okay."




The next few days were excruciating. Brandon and I moved around each other like ghosts, careful not to get too close. I slept alone in our bedroom while he took the guest room without complaint.

At work, everyone could feel the tension. The atmosphere at Stark Group
became so strained that people scattered when they saw either of us coming.

Lyanna, meanwhile, was clearly delighted by the rift between us. I caught her smirking at me more than once during meetings, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction.

By the fifth day, even I had to admit this couldn't go on. We were both miserable, both exhausted, both hurting. But I still couldn't bring myself to make the first move.

Then came the day I had to meet with representatives from Sotheby's. Leo Schmidt and I spent hours negotiating terms, and by the time we finished,I was mentally drained.

I was walking out of Christie's when I spotted Brandon's Bentley parked across the street. Leo excused himself almost immediately, and I knew without asking that Brandon had arranged it.

James held the car door open for me with a sympathetic smile. I slid into the back seat, not surprised to find Brandon already there.

"Mr. Schmidt seemed in a hurry," I commented dryly as James closed the door.

"He had another appointment," Brandon replied, not even attempting to hide the lie.

James started the car, and we pulled away from the curb. The silence between us was deafening.

"There's a new restaurant in Tribeca I thought we might try," Brandon said after a few minutes.


I didn't respond.
"Or there's that new movie everyone's talking about."

Still nothing.

"We could drive up to see your grandfather this weekend."

"Can you please be quiet?" I finally snapped, turning to glare at him.

Brandon's jaw tightened, and he pressed a button. The privacy screen between us and James silently rose.

The moment we were isolated, Brandon shifted closer. "Summer,I've respected your need for space, but this has gone on long enough. This cold treatment... I won't accept it anymore."

I turned to face him fully. "Does it feel bad, Brandon? Being shut out?Being left in the dark?" My voice was low but intense. "Because that's how I felt when I found out you've been hiding things from me."

Brandon's expression softened slightly. "It feels terrible," he admitted.

"That's how I felt too," I whispered. "That day, when Lyanna showed up with Timothy... I've never felt pain like that before. Not even when I caught Alexander with Victoria."

"Summer," Brandon said softly, "I'm with you. I've never wanted to be with anyone else.Have you?"

I met his eyes. "No. Never. Not since the moment we got together."

"Then tell me what I need to do to fix this."

I took a deep breath. "Tell me about Lyanna. Tell me the truth about your relationship with her. Tell me about Timothy."

Brandon's expression darkened."It's a relationship built on manipulation and exploitation-from both sides," he said bluntly. "Inever loved her.I
was never engaged to her."

"Then why-"

"Lyanna saved my life once," he interrupted. "Three years ago, she saved my life. I promised I'd repay her."

I gasped softly.

"After that, she disappeared. She'd been kidnapped fromStark property and was missing for a month. When we found her, she'd been raped.I helped keep it quiet."

"Oh my God," I whispered.

"My father wanted me to marry her. I agreed to an engagement, but before it could be announced, she ran away with someone. She was already pregnant when she left.'

"And Timothy?"

"Timothy is her son from that pregnancy," Brandon confirmed. "He's not mine, Summer. Timothy and my grandfather had DNA tests done. He's a Stark, but he's not my child."

I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. "Then whose...?"

Brandon's expression was grim. "That's the question. There are only a few possibilities, and none of them are good."

I sat back, absorbing all this. "So Lyanna came back because...?"

"I don't think it has anything to do with love. It's about Timothy's father and my grandfather's wishes. William Stark has always had a soft spot for Lyanna."

"And she's trying to break us up because your grandfather wants her for
you instead of me," I concluded.

Brandon nodded. "T've been tolerating her partly because of what she did for me, but mostly because I need to find out who Timothy's father really is."

I slowly reached out, placing my palm over his. "I'm sorry I didn't give you a chance to explain."

Brandon immediately turned his hhand to grasp mine. "I should have told you everything from the beginning. I was afraid it might drive you away."

"Nothing could drive me away," I said softly. "Not unless you wanted me gone."

"Never," he whispered. "I'Il never want you gone."

"Let's go home," Brandon said suddenly.

*Home*. The word struck me with unexpected force. Despite everything.
The Hamptons had become home-because Brandon was there.

I squeezed his hand and nodded."Yes," I said softly. "Let's go home."
###Chapter307

Summer's POV

The smell of beef stew hit me the moment I stepped into the kitchen.and my stomach immediately revolted. I froze in the doorway.

"Is dinner ready?" I asked, trying to sound normal despite the sudden wave of nausea washing over me.

Brandon looked up with a smile. "Almost. Go wash your hands! Dinner's ready!"

I took a cautious step forward, but as the rich aroma intensified, my stomach lurched violently. I clamped my hand over my mouth, feeling bile rise in my throat.

Brandon turned around, his smile fading instantly when he saw my face."
What's wrong? Are you okay?"

I couldn't answer. The smell was overwhelming now, and I felt cold sweat breaking out across my forehead. I shook my head frantically and bolted for the nearest trash can by the kitchen door.

I barely made it, doubling over the bin as my body heaved. But nothing came up except bitter liquid-I hadn't eaten much today.

"Summer!" Brandon was at my side in an instant, one hand on my back.”What's going on? Are you sick? Is it your stomach?"

I coughed and spit into the trash, trying to catch my breath. "I don't know,
" I managed to gasp. "The smell just hit me andI-"

I couldn't finish the sentence as another wave of nausea hit me. When I finally straightened up, I found Brandon staring at me with a strange intensity. His eyes had darkened, and his lips were pressed into a thin line.
"What?" I asked, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand. "Why are you looking at me like that?"

"When was your last period?" he asked abruptly.

I felt my face flush hot with embarrassment. "What? Why would you-"I stopped mid-sentence as his question actually registered in my brain.

*Oh my God.*

My mind raced back, trying to remember. When *was* my last period?I'd been so busy with work and everything happening with Lyanna that I hadn't even noticed...

"I... I don't know," I stammered, my heart suddenly pounding. "I can't remember."

Brandon pulled out his phone and opened his calendar app, scrolling back a few weeks. "According to this, you should have started around the 27th or 28th. Today's the 30th."

I stared at him,momentarily forgetting my nausea. "You track my periods in your calendar?"

He shrugged, not looking the least bit embarrassed. "Of course. It's important information."

"Oh my God," I whispered, my hand unconsciously moving to my stomach.
"I didn't get my period last month either. I thought it was just stress from everything that happened with Lyanna."

Brandon's eyes lit up, and a smile slowly spread across his face.

"You think I'm pregnant?" I asked, my voice barely audible.

Brandon didn't answer right away. Instead, he ran his hand through his hair-something he rarely did-and started pacing the kitchen. His usual
composure was completely gone, replaced by an almost manic energy I'd never seen in him before.

"Brandon?"

"You stay right there," he ordered, pointing at me. "Sit down. Since you don't want to eat this stuff, just rest. I'm going out for a bit!"

He was already moving, patting his pockets for his car keys, then doubling back to grab his wallet from the counter. He practically sprinted to the door, leaving me standing there in shock.

"Brandon!" I called after him. "Calm down! Where are you.going?"

"Just stay there!" he shouted back, and then he was gone.




Thirty-five minutes later, Brandon burst into the kitchen, still wearing his outdoor shoes, clutching a large pharmacy bag. His hair was disheveled.and there was a wild look in his eyes.

"Here," he said, thrusting the bag at me. "The pharmacy worker explained how to use them. I wasn't sure which one would be most accurate, so I got one of each brand. Just to be safe."

I peeked into the bag and felt mny face heat up. There had to be at least eight different pregnancy tests insde.

"Brandon!" I exclaimed, mortified. "I can't believe you bought out the entire pharmacy!"

"I was concerned about accuracy," he said seriously. "This is important,Summer. We need to be sure."

I headed toward the bathroom, feeling Brandon's eyes on me the whole way. "Brandon! Calm down, will you? I'm just going to try a couple first.
You stay here."

As I waitedfor the results, my mind raced with possibilities. What would it mean if I was pregnant? How would our lives change?

I glanced down at the first test and my heart leaped-two lines.Positive.

"Oh my God." I whispered, a smile spreading across my face. I couldn't help it-I actually jumped up and down a little in excitement.

To be sure. I quickly took a second test from a different brand. A few minutes later, there it was again-two lines. Positive.

When I finally opened the door, Brandon was right there,his face a mask of barely contained anxiety.

"Well?" he demanded, his voice tight. "What did it say?"

I arranged my features into a disappointed expression and sighed heavily."Brandon..."

His face fell immediately, and he stepped forward to pull me into his arms."It's okay," he said softly, stroking my hair. "We're still young, Summer.There's plenty of time for children later. Or we can start trying now if you want."

His immediate acceptance and support made my eyes well up with tears.I pushed against his chest to look up at him.

"Brandon Stark," I said, unable to keep the smile off my face any longer,"you are going to be a father,"

He froze, his eyes widening. "What?"

I laughed and pulled the two positive tests from my pocket, waving them in front of him. "T'wo lines. I'm pregnant!"
Brandon's expression transformed from confusion to pure joy in an instant.Before I could say another word, he had swept me up into his arms.spinning me around.

"Brandon!" I shrieked, laughing. "Put me down! Be careful with the baby!"

He immediately set me down, his hands moving to cradle my face. "You're right. I'm sorry. I'll be more careful." His eyes were shining with happiness."We're having a baby?"

I nodded, feeling tears of joy spill down my cheeks. "We're having a baby."

Brandon pressed his forehead against mine, his hands now gently resting on my still-flat stomach. "I can't believe it," he murmured. "This is amazing."

"Are you happy?" I asked softly.

"Happy doesn't begin to cover it," he replied, his voice thick with emotion."Summer, this is... I never thought I could feel this way."

"And we need to call Sean," Brandon continued, already pulling out his phone. "We need to get you the best doctor, schedule a full checkup, make sure everything is okay."

"Brandon," I said, placing my hand over his. "Slow down. We have time for all that tomorrow. Right now, can we just... enjoy this moment?"

He took a deep breath and nodded, his face softening into a smile that made my heart melt."You're right."

I placed my hand on my stomach, marveling at themiracle growing inside me. Despite all the drama with Lyanna, despite all the business challenges,despite everything-this felt right. This felt like the beginning of something beautiful.
"Our baby." I whispered, looking up at Brandon with tears in my eyes.

"Our baby," he repeated, his voice filled with wonder. "I love you,Summer.Both of you."
###Chapter308

Summer's POV

The next morning. I found myself being ushered into Manhattan General Hospital like precious cargo. Brandon had barely slept,spending most of the night researching pregnancy symptoms and making calls. By 7 AM, he d arranged for us to see Dr. Sean Sullivan and apparently the best obstetrics specialist in New York.

"Brandon," I whispered as we walked through the hospital's pristine corridors. "you do realize I'm just pregnant, not made of glass,right?"

He didn't even crack a smile. "We need to make sure everything's perfect."

Sean met us at the entrance to the obstetrics department, looking amused at Brandon's intensity. "Good morning, expectant parents," he said cheerfully. "Summer, how are you feeling?"

"Fine,just-"

"She threw up last night," Brandon interrupted. "And this morning.Twice.



I rolled my eyes. "I can speak for myself, thank you very much."

After being led into an examination room, I underwent what felt like every test known to medical science. Blood draws, urine samples, questionnaires about my medical history-you name it, they did it. Brandon waited outside, and I could only imagine him pacing the hallway like an expectant father from a 1950s sitcom.

When I finally emerged from the examination room, Brandon was at my side in an instant, his arm around my waist.

"How do you feel? Are you tired? Dizzy?" His eyes scanned my face with
such intensity that I almost laughed.

"Im completely fine!" I reassured him, accepting the bottle of water he practically shoved into my hands. "'It was just routine testing, Brandon.Nothing exhausting."

"She's right." Sean chimed in, walking over to us. "Most of these tests are standard procedure."

Brandon ignored him, instead pulling a thermos from his bag. "Here, I brought you some warm water. The temperature is perfect."

I accepted it with a smile, genuinely moved by his thoughtfulness despite his over-the-top behavior. As I took a sip, I noticed Sean eyeing Brandon's bag with growing amusement.

"Dude," Sean said, peering into Brandon's open bag, "what else do you have in there? A portable hospital?"

I glanced down and had to stifle a laugh. The bag was packed with everything from energy bars to a small blanket, multiple bottles of water,and what looked like a first aid kit.

"Don't you think you're overreacting a bit?" Sean Continued. "You guys don't even know for sure if she's pregnant yet. The hometests are pretty accurate,but still."

Brandon shot him a withering look. "What would you know? Have you ever been a father?" He paused for dramatic effect. "Oh wait, you've never even been married."

Sean's mouth dropped open, and his expression darkened like someone had just pulled the plug on his sunny disposition. I bit my lip to keep from laughing at his utterly offended face.

"Since we've done all the tests," I asked, "when can we expect to get the

Sean,still looking slightly wounded from Brandon's verbal jab, cleared his throat. "The pregnancy test results will be available very soon. As for the other tests Brandon insisted on-complete blood count, hormone levels,genetic screenings-those will take longer."

"Complete genetic screening?" I raised an eyebrow at Brandon. "Seriously?"

Before I could get an answer, a woman in a white coat approached us. She was in her fifties with kind eyes and an air of quiet authority.

"Dr. Morgan." Sean greeted her. "These are the Starks. Brandon and Summer."

Dr.Morgan smiled, but I noticed her eyes lingering on Brandon with a mixture of amusement and assessment. With his intense stare and protective stance, he probably looked like either the world's most devoted husband or a high-functioning lunatic.

"Mr. Stark, Mrs. Stark," she nodded. "The initial results will be ready momentarily."

Brandon stepped forward. "And you're certain these tests are comprehensive? I want to make sure we're not missing anything."

Dr. Morgan's smile never faltered. "Mr. Stark, I've been delivering babies for twenty-five years. I assure you, the tests we've run are more than adequate." She turned to me with a warmer expression. "Based on my experience, Mrs. Stark, I believe you are indeed pregnant. You're showing all the classic signs,"

My heart fluttered at her words, and I instinctively placed my hand over my stomach.

True to her word, a nurse appeared shortly with a folder. Dr. Morgan
reviewed the contents. her face breaking into a genuine smile as she looked up at us.

"Congratulations. Mr. and Mrs. Stark. You're definitely pregnant." She paused, her smile widening. "And based on the hormone levels, I'd say you're about five weeks along."

Brandon immediately took the folder from her hands, scrutinizing every detail with laser-like focus. His eyes widened as he studied what looked like an ultrasound image.

"Is that...?" he began, his voice uncharacteristically soft.

Dr. Morgan nodded. "Yes, those are your babies. Twins, Mr. Stark."

"Twins?" I gasped, my knees suddenly feeling weak. Brandon's arm tightened around me.

"Twins," Dr. Morgan confirmed. "It's too early to determine whether they're identical or fraternál, but there are definitely two separate embryonic sacs."


I stared at the ultrasound image, trying to make sense of the tiny blobs that would become our children. The reality of it hit me all at once, and I felt tears spring to my eyes.

Sean,who had been watching this exchange with uncharacteristic silence.finally broke into a wide grin.

"Holy shit, Brandon is actually broken," he laughed. "Look at him! I've never seen him like this in all the years I've known him."

I couldn't help but smile. It was true-Brandon looked completely unlike himself. The usual cool,calculated CEO was nowhere to be seen, replaced by an awestruck soon-to-be father.
Brandon suddenly snapped back to attention, turning to Dr. Morgan with renewed intensity. He stepped slightly in front of me, as if physically shielding me from Sean.

"What precautions should she be taking? Diet restrictions? Activity limitations?" The questions poured out of him in rapid succession. "And what about prenatal vitamins? Should she start taking them immediately?"

Dr. Morgan's eyes crinkled with amusement. "Mr. Stak, I'll provide you with a complete list of recommendations. With twins, we do need to be a bit more cautious, but Mrs. Stark appears to be in excellent health."

She turned to me. "You'll need to come in for more frequent check-ups than with a singleton pregnancy. Twins can sometimes lead to complications, but please don't worry-we'll be monitoringyou closely."

"Since your husband seems particularly concerned," Dr. Morgan said with a smile, "I'll write out a detailed care plan for you both. And Mr. Stark."she added, looking directly at Brandon, "try to remember that your wife is pregnant, and stay with her as long sa you can."
###Chapter309

Summer's POV

I was still processing the fact that I was pregnant with twins when my phone rang. Brandon had just stepped out to take a call from James about some urgent Stark Group matter, leaving me alone in the study of The Hamptons estate. Glancing at the caller ID, I saw it was my grandfather,Jonathan Thompson.

"Hello, Grandpa," I answered,smiling.

"Well,imagine my surprise when that old man George called to brag about becoming a great-grandfather before me! Hmph!" Jonathan huffed. "That fool had the nerve to gloat, as if he has more right to know about my granddaughter's pregnancy than I do!"

My pupils constricted in shock. How did hel already know about my pregnancy? We'd only confirmed it this morning!

I couldn't help but laugh. "Grandpa, are you seriously having a competition about who gets to be a great-grandfather first?"

"Don't change the subject, young lady," he grumbled. "Why did I have to hear this news from that smug old goat instead of from you?"

"Grandpa, don't be upset," I said quickly. "I was planning to tell you.I swear! Brandon just wanted to make sure everything was confirmed before we started telling people. We didn't want to get everyone's hopes up in case it was a false alarm."


"And? Is it confirmed?" His voice softened slightly, anticipation replacing his annoyance.

"Yes, it is," I said, unable to keep the excitement from my voice.′′I3definitely pregnant."
"Ha! Wonderful! I'm going to be a great-grandfather!" His voice boomed with delight, all traces of irritation vanished. "When did you find out?How far along are you?"

"The test results came back today. I'm about five weeks along." I explained.still marveling at the reality myself.

"Excellent, excellent! This calls for a celebration!" Jonathan declared.

"Actually. Grandpa, there's something else-something that old man doesn't know yet," I said,feeling a little mischievous.

"Oh?" His interest was immediately piqued.

"The tests came back from Dr. Sean's clinic today. I'm having twins!"

There was a moment of stunned silence, then an explosive whoop of joy that forced me to hold the phone away from my ear.

"Twins! My God, twins!" Jonathan was practically shouting. "This is fantastic! Oh, I can't wait to tell George-his face will be priceless!"

I laughed, picturing the two elderly rivals trying to one-up each other with grandfather bragging rights.

"Summer, you must come to dinner tonight," he insisted. "Come to my place in upstate right away. I'll prepare all your favorites. What would you like to eat? Just name it, and I will make it happen!"

"Grandpa,I-"

"No excuses! You and Brandon are coming tonight. I insist," he said, his tone brooking no argument. "And from now on, I'm sending Parker to The Hamptons to take care of you. You need proper looking after,especially with twins!"

I bit my lip, trying not to laugh at how everyone was suddenly treating me
like I was made of porcelain. Between Brandon's helicopter hovering and now my grandfather's fussing, these next eight months were going to be interesting.

"Grandpa, that's really not necessary-"

"It absolutely is! Parker will make sure you're eating properly and getting enough rest. He knows exactly what pregnant women need-he took care of your grandmother when she was expecting your mother!"

Before I could protest further, he abruptly ended the call with, "I'll see you tonight. Don't be late!"

I stared at my phone, torn between amusement and exasperation.When Brandon walked back into the study, I couldn't help but shake my head and laugh.

"What's so funny?" he asked, sitting beside me on the leather couch.

"That was my grandfáther," I explained. "Apparently, Grandpa George already knows about the pregnancy and called to gloat about becoming a great-grandfather. Grandpa's invited us to dinner tonight so he can properly celebrate."

Brandon nodded, unsurprised. "I heard most of it. Your grandfather's getting increasingly childish in his old age."

"We'll have to go," I sighed. "He won't take no for an answer."

"Of course," Brandon agreed easily. "Jamescan handle things at the office."

I studied Brandon's face, suddenly curious about something that had been nagging at me. "Brandon, you were my grandfather's student once, weren't you? That's how you first knew me?"

A small smile played at the corner of his mouth. "Maybe. Why do you ask?
I frowned. trying to conjure up memories from that time. "It's strange, but I can't seem to remember much from those years. I should be able to recall meeting you, e'specially if you were Grandpa's star student. He never mentioned you to me either, which is odd considering how much he values talented students."

Brandon's eyes flickered briefly with something I couldn't quite read."Your memory's not that bad. Don't worry about it."

"But it doesn't make sense," I persisted. "I should remember something.According to what you've said, we met before that day at the grand hotel,but I have absolutely no recollection of it. My memory isn't usually this spotty."

Brandon reached out and tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. "Don't strain yourself trying to remember. It's not important now."

"But it is," I insisted. "When exactly did you first start... you know, being interested in me? And why wait until then to make a move?"

Brandon's expression grew more serious. "I've known you longer than you realize,Summer."

I felt my heart skip a beat. "So that wasn't our first meeting? I always thought it was."

"No," he said quietly, "That wasn't the first time we met."

The revelation hit me like a thunderbolt. Everything I thought I knew about our relationship suddenly shifted. "So you knew who I was all along? All those times we ran into each other,everything that happened between us-you already knew me?"

"Yes," he admitted. "I've been aware of who you are for a long time."
"So you've been... what? Watching me? Following my life?" I was trying to process this new information.

Brandon's lips curved into a small smile. "You could say I've had my eye on you for quite some time."

I nodded slowly, a strange warmth spreading through my chest. "I had no idea. I'm genuinely surprised-and touched. I never thought anyone would care about me that much, especially someone like you."

"Why are you surprised?" He reached out and took my hand. "Is it so hard to believe that I'd fall for you?"

"I just... I never expected it," I admitted. "When did it start? When did you first decide you were interested in me?"

Brandon's smile turned enigmatic. "Figure it out yourself. Then come ask me if you're right."

I narrowed my eyes at him. "How come I don't recall any of that?"

"That's also what I'm tring to find out," he said.

As I stared at my husband-this man who had apparently been part of my life far longer than I realized-I felt both confused and strangely comforted. There was more to our story than I knew, pieces of a puzzle I couldn't yet see.
###Chapter 310

Summer's POV

After spending a few days at the hospital. I was ready to leave-but not to go home. James had pulled the car around and was now trying his best to convince me that The Hamptons was the only sensible destination.

"Mrs. Stark. Mr. Stark specifically asked me to take you back to the estate,"James said, his voice strained as he held the car door open. "He wants you to rest properly."

I slid into the backseat and gave him a look. "James, I appreciate the concern, but I'm not an invalid. I'm pregnant, not sick."

"But Mr. Stark was very clear about-"

"I don't want to sit alone in that huge house all day," I cut him off. "The pregnancy symptoms aren't eventhat bad yet. Besides, I need to catch up on work."

James hesitáted, one hand still on the door. I could practically see him weighing Brandon's wrath against my determination.

"Look," I said, softening my tone, "I promise I'll take it easy. If anything happens, I'll take full responsibility. Brandon can't blame you for my stubbornness."

With visible reluctance, James closed my door and circled around to the driver's seat. "Mr. Stark won't be pleased."

"I'll handle Brandon," I assured him. "Now, can we please go to Stark Group?"




When we arrived at Stark Group headquarters, the sleek glass building
towered above us. As James escorted me through the lobby, I noticed how conversations hushed and eyes followed our progress.

"Is that Summer Taylor?"

"Why is she here?”

"Do you think Mr. Stark is finally going to announce their relationshíp?"

"What happened to that York woman he was seeing?"

The whispers trailed behind us like perfume. I kept my chin up and my expression neutral.

In the private elevator, James finally relaxed a fraction. "Mrs. Stark, please don't let those comments bother you. People here have nothing better to do than gossip.

"I'm used to it," I said with a shrug. "Office politics are the same everywhere."

"When will Brandon finish his meeting?" I asked.

"Mr. Stark is in acquisition talks with the Morrison Group. Those meetings typically run long-they've been at it since early morning."

"I see," I tapped my fingers against my purse. "WVill he be free for lunch?"

"I... doubt it," James replied carefully. "The negotiations are at a critical stage. Are you feeling bored, Mrs. Stark? Or perhaps hungry?"

I shook my head. "I'm fine, James. Don't hover. You're starting to sound like Brandon."


The elevator doors opened onto the executive floor. "I'll take you to Mr.Stark's office," James said. "You can wait there comfortably until he's available."
His office was exactly as I remembered-sleek,minimalist, and dominated by black and white tones. The floor-to-ceiling windows offered a spectacular view of Manhattan.

"Would you like anything? Coffee? Tea? Something to eat?" James hovered by the door.

"I'm fine, James. You don't need to babysit me. I know you have work to do."

"Mr. Stark would want me to ensure you're comfortable."

"James," I said firmly, "I'm perfectly capable of sitting in an office by myself. Go handle whatever Brandon's piled on your desk."

Once he'd finally left, I exhaled and sank onto Brandon's leather sofa.I picked up a business magazine from the coffee table and flipped through it,not really reading.

I was halfway through an article about tech startups when I heard footsteps approaching. Assuming it was Brandon, I looked up with a smile.

The door opened, but instead of my husband, an elderly man with silver hair and piercing eyes stood in the doorway. William Stark-Brandon's grandfather.

"Brandon, we need to discuss-" He stopped abruptly when he saw me.His eyes narrowed."You,"

I stood up quickly. "Mr. Stark... I mean, um, Brandon isn't here right now.
1

William Stark's expression hardened as he entered the office,leaning slightly on his cane. "I can see that. What I don't understand is what you're doing in my grandson's office during business hours."
I swallowed hard but kept my composure. "I was just waiting for Brandon to finish his meeting."

"Is that so?" His tone dripped with disapproval. "Young lady, thisis a workday. People here have actual responsibilities, unlike some who apparently have nothing better to do than lounge around in offices that don't belong to them."

I took a deep breath. This was not how I'd planned to interact with Brandon's grandfather, but I wasn't going to let him intimidate me either.

"Sir," I said. testing the waters with the familial term.

His eyebrows shot up.

I nodded, keeping my expression neutral. "Mr. Stark. Would you like to sit down? You've been standing for a while, and I'd be happy to help you to the sofa.

I moved toward him, but he raised his hand to stop me.

"Don't touch me," he snapped. "I may be old, but I'm not an invalid."

"Of course," I replied smoothly. "My mistake. Woyld you like some tea while you wait for Brandon? I'd be happy to prepare it for you."

William Stark observed me with suspicious eyes. "You think you can win me over with a cup of tea?"

I gave hím a small smile. "Not at all, Chairman. I just thought you might be thirsty after coming all the way up here."

He scoffed but didn't refuse. Taking his silence as permission, I walked to Brandon's private rest area where I knew he kept a selection of teas.

When I returned with the tea tray, William was still standing,seemingly unwilling to make himself comfortable in my presence.
"I see my grandson hasn't taught you properoffice etiquette," he remarked coldly. "This is a place of business, not your personal living room."

I set the tray down carefully. "Chairman Stark, would you prefer that I leave? I can wait elsewhere if my presence is disturbing you."

He studied me for a moment. "You have remarkably thick skin. Most people would have scurried away by now."

I shrugged lightly. "I've found that running away rarely solves anything."

I selected a few green tea macarons from the plate I'd prepared. "Would you like a macaron, Chairman? They're quite good."

"Do you always make yourself so at home in places that don't belong to you?"

"Hmm, it seems you're not hungry," I said, ignoring his question. "That's fine. I'm starving though, so I hope you don't mind if I eat."

Without waiting for his response, I sat down and took a bite of a macaron,closing my eyes briefly in appreciation of the delicate flavor. "These are really delicious. Monica has excellent taste."

When I opened my eyes, William was staring at me with an incredulous expression that had turned almost angry.

"Who gave you the audacity to eat in Brandon's office?" he demanded.

I swallowed my bite, coughing slightly as a crumb went down the wrong way. "Cough,cough...well,you did,Chairman."

"I did no such thing!" His voice roseslightly.

"You refused the food I offered," I explained calmly after recovering."In my experience, when someone declines food but doesn't object to others eating, it's an implicit permission. Besides, these pregnancy cravings are
really something else."

William's eyes widened slightly at the mention of my pregnancy,but he quickly masked his reaction. I could see him reassessing me. perhaps wondering if I was more calculating than he'd initially thought.

The silence stretched between us, broken only by the sound of me enjoying another macaron.
###Chapter 311

Summer's POV

The silence hung between us like a heavy curtain as William Stark stared me down, his eyes narrowing with each macaron I ate. I wasn't backing down though-something told me that showing weakness to this man was the worst possible move.

"So," William finally broke the silence, his voice dripping with disdain,"you think pregnancy gives you the right to disrupt my grandson's business?"

I dabbed the corner of my mouth with a napkin, taking my sweet time before answering. "I'm not disrupting anything, Chairman. I'm simply waiting for my husband."

His jaw tightened at the word "husband," and I could practically see him counting to ten in his head.

"Young lady," he said, leaning forward on his cane, "I don't know what game you're playing, but this marriage-"

"Isn't a game to me," I cut him off, my voice firm but not confrontational."And I have a name. It's Summer. Summer Stark now, actually."

He scoffed. "You may have gotten Brandon to put a ring on your finger,but don't think for a second that makes you part of this family."

I shrugged, reaching for the teapot. "More tea, Mr. Stark?"

His nostrils flared at my casual dismissal of his hostility. "You haven't answered my question. What are you doing here during business hours?"

"I've taken some time off work," I said, deliberately dragging out my words.
"Time off?" His eyebrows shot up. "To do what? Lounge around Brandon's office eating sweets?"

"Actually," I replied, setting down my cup. "T'll take quite a long leave of absence."

"How long?" he demanded.

I smiled slightly. "Oh, about ten months."

William's eyes narrowed1. then widened as the implication hit him. "Ten...ten months?"

"I am." I confirmed, unable to keep a hint of pride from my voice. "Dr.Sean confirmed it. We're having twins."

The transformation on William's face was fascinating to watch. First came shock, then a flash of genuine delight that softened his severe features. For a brief moment, I glimpsed the loving grandfather beneath the stern patriarch.

Then, just as quickly, his expression darkened again.

"Hmph," he grunted. "Lyanna gave Brandon a son too, you know.That didn't change anything."

The mention of Brandon's ex stung, but I kept my expression neutral. "I'm not trying to change anything,Chairman. I'm just sharing news about your future great-grandchildren."

William studied me intently, his fingers tightening around his cane.I could tell he was conflicted-he clearly didn't like me, but the prospect of Stark heirs was something he couldn't dismiss.

"Dr. Sullivan examined you?" he asked abruptly.

"Yes," I nodded. "He's been monitoring the pregnancy closely."
This seemed to satisfy him somewhat. "At least Brandon had the sense to involve Sean."

I bit back a retort. The old man was calculating what my pregnancy meant for his precious dynasty, and I refused to let it bother me.

"You know." William said, his voice taking on a speculative tone,"Brandon could always adopt Timothy. The boy already calls him Daddy."

I felt a flash of anger. "Timothy has a mother, and her name is Lyanna York. He doesn't need Brandon to adopt him."

"The Stark name would give the boy advantages-"

"The boy has a name," I interrupted, my patience wearing thin. "And he has a mother who loves him. Brandon isn't going to disrupt that family just to please your dynastic ambitions."

William's eyes widened at my bluntness. I stood up and walked to the tea service,pouring him a fresh cup.

"Here," I said, offering it to him. "The tea is getting cold."

He accepted it reluctantly, taking a cautious sip. His eyebrows rose slightly in surprise.


"You..." he paused, studying me over the rim of his cup. "You make decent tea. Where did you learn this?"

"My grandfather," I replied simply.

"And who might that be?" he asked with thinly veiled condescension.

"Jonathan Thompson."

William froze mid-sip, a flicker of recognition passing across his face. He set down his cup slowly, his expression calculating.
"Thompson," he repeated. as if testing the name. "Never heard of him. Just another nameless academic. I suppose."

I couldn't help but smile. "Thank you for the compliment.Sir!"

"Excuse me?" he sputtered, nearly choking on his tea.

"Well,you called my grandfather a 'nameless academíc," I explained innocently. "Given your standards, that's practically a glowing endorsement.
"

William opened his mouth to retort when the door swung open, and Brandon strode in. His eyes moved from me to his grandfather, instantly assessing the situation.

"Summer," he said, crossing the room to sit beside me. He took my hand in his, a gesture that wasn't lost on William. "I didn't expect to see you here."

"I was getting bored at home," I explained. "And I've been having a lovely chat with your grandfather."

Brandon's eyes narrowed slightly as he glanced at William. "Is that so?"

"She's pregnant," William announced bluntly, watching Brandon's reaction.

Brandon's face remained impassive, but his grip on my hand tightened slightly. "I'm aware."

"Twins," William added.

"Yes, Grandfather. I'm aware of that too."

William huffed."And you let her come to the office in her condition?"

"Let me?" I interjected. "Brandon doesn't 'let me' do things. We make decisions together."
Brandon's lips twitched with amusement. "Summer is perfectly capable of deciding where she wants to be."

"Well, she shouldn't be here," William declared. "She should be resting."

"I feel fine," I protested. "I want to keep working for as long as I can."

William slammed his cane against the floor. "Absolutely not! Pregnancy is a delicate condition. From today,you're not to set foot in any office."

I blinked in surprise at his vehemence. Brandon, however, seemed to be fighting a smile.

"For once," Brandon said, "we agree on something, Grandfather."

"What?" I turned to him, betrayed. "Brandon, I'm perfectly healthy.Dr.Sean said-"

"Sean is a friend first, doctor second," William cut in. "Of course he'd tell you what you want to hear."

"Grandfather's right, Summer," Brandon said, his tone gentler than William's but equally firm. "With twins, you need to be extra careful."

I looked between the two men, realizing I was outnumbered.

William tapped his cane decisively. "From tomorrow, you two will move back to the Stark family residence."

"What?" Brandon and I exclaimed simultaneously.

"You heard me," William said. "The Hamptons is too isolated. At the family home, there will be staff to attend to her needs."

I looked at Brandon, expecting him to object. Instead, he seemed to be considering the idea.
"Ill bring her home after work." Brandon told his grandfather.

"Good!" William declared. looking smugly satisfied. He headed for the door.then pansed. "Don't think this means i approve of you.young lady.But those babies are Starks, and Starks take care of their own."
###Chapter 312

Brandon's POV

The Thompson residence stood proud and elegant in the Upper East Side.its classic architecture a testament to old New York money and academic prestige. I arrived precisely at seven. James Wilson following a step behind me as we approached the entrance. Parker, the elderly butler who'd served the Thompson family for decades, opened the door before I could even ring the bell.

"Mr. Stark," Parker greeted with a formal bow. "Professor Thompson is expecting you."

I nodded curtly as James shifted the packages in his arms-a rare antique from Christie's and a bottle of 1982 Chateau Lafite. When Parker reached to take them, I raised my hand.

"He's my assistant, not a delivery boy," I said coolly. "He'll carry them himself."

Parker's expression rémained professionally neutral."Of course,sir.The Professor is in his study. I stíll have a special dish to prepare, so perhaps you'd like to joina him while I finish in the kitchen?"

The house had always felt more like a library than a home-walls lined with books, the scent of aged paper permeating every room.Parker knocked gently on the study door before announcing me.

Jonathan Thompson sat in his leather armchair, staring pensively at a half-finished chess game.

"Brandon," he said, his eyes lighting up. His smile faltered slightly as he looked past me. "Summer didn't join you tonight?"

"She is at the Stark family residence. What we are about to talk about
tonight isn't something I want Summer to know about yet." I replied.sitting in the chair opposite his.

Thompson's eyebrows rose slightly. "How is she? Her health, I mean."

"She's well." I replied, studying his face. "But I should be asking about you.Professor.You're looking tired."

He waved away my concern. "I'm an old academic. Brandon. As long as you're taking care of my precious granddaughter, you needn't worry about me."

"You're not just Summer's grandfather," I reminded him."You were my most respected professor at Columbia. Your well-being matters to me."

Thompson's eyes softened. "Always the diplomat when you want to be. So unlike the ruthless CEO the financial world knows." He gestured toward the chess set. "What brings you here tonight?"

I leaned forward, my gaze direct. "Professor, I need to know if Summer has experienced some kind of trauma in her past. Or if she's forgotten something...significant."

The change in Thompson's expression was subtle but unmistakable-a flicker of alarm quickly masked. "How did you figure it out?" he asked quietly.

"That's not important," I replied. "What matters is understanding what happened to her."

Thompson sighed deeply. "I suppose now that she's carrying your child.you deserve to know." He paused, his eyes growing distant. "It happened when Summer was fifteen. You were studying abroad at the time."

"One day, Summer didn't come home from school," Thompson continued,his voice heavy, "The Taylor household was in chaos. We searched
everywhere. The next morning. Manhattan General Hospital called.Summer had been found by the East River, half-submerged in water. The person who found her thought she was dead."

My hands tightened imperceptibly on the armrests.

"When we arrived at the hospital, she was unconscious. Bruised all over."Thompson's voice cracked. "No one knew what had happened. She was in a coma for three days."

"And when she woke up?" I prompted, keeping my voice even despite the rage building inside me.

"She had no memory of what happened," Thompson said. "The doctors said it was her mind's way of protecting itself. We told her she'd been very ill."


"So Summer doesn't know any of this?"

Thompson shook his head firmly. "No, George and I made it very clear to everyone that she was never to know."

"She experienced memory loss," I stated. "But not complete amnesia."

"No, not complete," Thompson confirmed. "Just that specific period of time.
"

"Professor," I said, a bitter smile touching my lips, "she forgot me too."

Thompson's eyes widened before understanding dawned. "Yes... after that,she never mentioned you again. And you went abroad, I thought your teenage relationship had come to an end..."

I felt a cold fury rising within me. Thompson must have sensed it because he suddenly stopped speaking, his eyes fixed on mine.

"Brandon," he said carefully, "you're not the same young man who sat in
my classroom anymore, are you?"

I ignored his question. "After I left, what happened to Summer?"

"She met Alexander Stark at Columbia. They dated for years. Were engaged until..." he trailed off.

"Until he betrayed her with Victoria," I finished.

"Yes," Thompson sighed. "That was a terrible blow to her."

"So," I said, my voice dangerously soft, "if Alexander hadn't betrayed Summer, would you have let her marry him? If Summer had actually married someone else, what do you think I would have done, Professor?"


Thompson met my gaze steadily. "You wouldn't have done anything inappropriate. I know your character."

A smile spread across my face that made Thompson shift uncomfortably."People change,Professor. Summer has always been mine. Always will be."

Thompson nodded slowly. "I understand that now. And I suspect your hand in what happened with Alexander and Victoria was far more significant than what I saw."

"You're very perceptive," I acknowledged.

"Let's play chess," he suggested instead.

As we reset the board, I said, "After this game,you'll need to answer one more question for me."

"What question?" Thompson asked.

"About Summer's parents."

The bishop slipped from Thompson's fingers, clattering onto the board."
What about them? She's Richard and Elizabeth Taylor's daughter, of course.
”

"Professor," I said quietly, "are you still going to hide the truth?"

Thompson sighed deeply. "You're right. Summer isn't Richard and Elizabeth's biological daughter. She's my youngest daughter's child."

"Your youngest daughter?" I repeated, genuinely surprised.

"Amanda has been gone for years," he said bitterly. "She had a terrible fight with me when she was twenty-two. She ran off with a married man.When she returned to New York, she was carrying Summer.Within weeks,she died from postpartum complications."

"Her final wish was for Summer to have a normal family. She made me promise never to tell Summer the truth." Thompson's eyes glistened. "I couldn't raise an infant alone, so I asked Elizabeth and Richard to take her.I promise them if they see Summer as their own daughter, I will give them all my assets after I die. By the time I regretted my decision and wanted to bring Summer back, it was already too late. She had grown so much and had developed her own understanding of family and kinship.I couldn't bring myself to tell her such a cruel truth. That's why George and I went out of our way to be good to Summer-we just hoped she wouldn't have to live a worse life."


Thompson suddenly gripped my arm, his fingers surprisingly strong."Brandon, I need your word that you won't tell anyone about this.Especially not Summer." His eyes were intense with urgency. "And thisisn't just my request-it was Amanda's dying wish. If Summer learns the truth now, she'll question everything about her life."

His voice broke slightly. "This isn't just about Summer's happiness anymore. It's about your child too. I know you love her. I know you won't let anyone hurt her-and this truth would hurt her more than anything."
###Chapter313


Summer's POV
The afternoon sun streamed through the windows of the Stark family residence as I sat cross-legged on the floor with Angela, colorful letter tiles scattered between us.
"Your turn," I said, watching her small face scrunch up in concentration.
"C-A-T," Angela announced proudly, placing each tile with deliberate care.
"Great job!" I clapped, genuinely impressed. "That's three points for you."
Angela beamed, her smile reminding me so much of Brandon. It was hard to believe I'd been living here for several months now. After everything that happened, the Stark family had been insistent that I needed proper rest and care during my pregnancy. Brandon was even more protective than usual, if that was possible.
I placed my tiles down. "R-A-I-N. That's four points for me."
Angela pouted playfully. "You're too good at this game, Aunt Summer!"
I laughed, about to respond when James appeared in the doorway, my phone in his hand.
"Mrs. Stark, your phone has been ringing repeatedly," he said, extending it toward me. "I thought it might be important."
I glanced at the screen and froze. Victoria. Why the hell would she be calling me?
"Thank you, James," I managed, taking the phone. "Angela, sweetie, can we finish our game in a little bit? I need to take this call."
Angela nodded and started organizing the tiles while I stepped into the hallway, staring at my phone like it might bite me. After a moment's hesitation, I answered.
"Hello?"
"Summer, come out and meet me!" Victoria's voice came through immediately, sharp and demanding.
I frowned. "Victoria, what do you want?"
"Just meet me. We need to talk."
"Victoria, what could we possibly have to talk about?" I kept my voice level, though my heart had already started racing.
"Summer, I want your Capital Corp shares," she stated bluntly.
I almost laughed. "And why would I give them to you?"
"What if I don't give them to you?" I challenged, keeping my voice low so Angela wouldn't hear.
There was a pause, and then Victoria's voice dropped to something almost sinister. "Summer, don't you want to know why you were abandoned by the riverside when you were fifteen? Why you were found half-dead and forgotten?"
My hand froze on the phone. A chill ran down my spine as fragmented memories—flashes of cold water, darkness, and fear—surfaced in my mind. How did she know about that? Nobody ever talked about it. Even I only had vague, disconnected images that haunted my dreams sometimes.
"What did you say?" I whispered, my voice suddenly hoarse.
Victoria's laugh was cold. "You heard me. Don't you want to know why you were found by the East River, covered in bruises and barely conscious? I have quite the story to tell."
My breathing became shallow. The walls of the hallway seemed to close in. "Is it... was it you? Did you do that?"
"Hmm, I wonder." Victoria taunted. "Actually, I still have the photos from that day. You look absolutely broken, Summer. Drowned and discarded like trash. What do you think would happen if Brandon or the Starks saw those images of you at your absolute lowest? Do you think your perfect little marriage would survive a scandal like that?"
"Photos?" I repeated, my voice rising sharply. I gripped the phone so tightly my knuckles turned white. "It was you! It was you who did that to me!"
Victoria ignored my accusation. "Bring the share transfer documents when you come. One hour."
The call ended abruptly. I stood there, trembling, my mind racing with fragments of memories I'd never been able to piece together. I hurried upstairs to my room, my legs feeling like lead. I needed to see those photos. I needed to know what happened to me all those years ago—the truth I'd been denied.
As I grabbed my purse and car keys, Sarah appeared in the doorway.
"Summer? Are you alright? You look pale." Her concerned eyes scanned my face.
"I'm fine," I lied, forcing a smile. "Just going to meet a friend."
Sarah frowned. "Should you be going out alone? Brandon asked us to—"
"It's someone Brandon knows," I cut in, desperate to leave. "Really, Sarah. I'll be careful. I know how to take care of myself."
She still looked uncertain, but nodded reluctantly. I hurried past her, my heart pounding. Once in the car, my phone rang again. Victoria.
"I'm at a coffee shop near Central Park. One hour. If you don't show up, these photos will go public." Her voice was cold and calculating.
"Victoria, you dare..." My voice shook with rage. "I'm coming right now!"
I drove as fast as I safely could, my mind spinning with questions. What exactly happened that day? Why couldn't I remember?
The coffee shop was upscale and relatively quiet when I arrived forty minutes later. Victoria sauntered in with Sophie trailing behind her. The smug look on her face made my blood boil.
"Didn't expect these photos to be so important to you," Victoria said as she slid into the seat across from me. "If I'd known, I would have used them much sooner."
"Is it true?" I demanded, ignoring her taunt. "Was it you? Did you have something to do with what happened to me back then?"
Victoria's smile widened, her eyes glittering with malice. "What do you think?"
Fragments of memories flashed through my mind—being pushed, cold water, darkness, panic. I'd always had these flashes, but doctors said they might just be my mind creating false memories to fill the gap.
"It was you," I said, my voice hardening with certainty. "You did that to me."
Victoria merely smiled, neither confirming nor denying. "Where are the documents? The share transfer for Capital Corp that I asked you to bring."
"I didn't bring anything," I said flatly. "Go ahead and release whatever you have. I'm not afraid."
Victoria's smile faltered. "You're bluffing. The shares—where are they? Grandfather George gave them to you!"
I leaned forward, meeting her gaze steadily. "I sold them. Months ago. I told you all back then, but none of you believed me."
"You're lying!" Victoria hissed. "How could you sell them? You'd never give up something from Grandfather!"
"Well, I did," I replied calmly, though my heart was racing. "So go ahead, do your worst. Expose whatever you want."
Victoria's face contorted with rage. She reached into her purse and pulled out a sealed envelope. "If you don't give me those shares, I'll make sure Brandon and the entire Stark family see these. I'll make sure everyone knows exactly how pathetic you looked!"
I studied her for a moment, a strange calm settling over me. "You're sure that's what you want to do?"
"Summer, if you don't give me those shares, I will destroy you," Victoria threatened, her voice rising. "I'll make sure you lose everything—your marriage, your place in the Stark family, everything!"
"Absolutely not," I said firmly.
Victoria's face flushed with anger. She grabbed her coffee cup, clearly intending to throw it at me, but Sophie quickly caught her arm.
"Careful!" Sophie warned, pulling Victoria back.
Hot coffee splashed onto the floor instead of me. Several patrons looked over, startled by the commotion.
"Sophie, what are you doing?" Victoria snapped, yanking her arm free. "You're helping her?"
Sophie said urgently, "Have you lost your mind? Summer is pregnant! If that coffee had hit her—do you realize what you could have done? Remember why we came here. You wanted the shares, right? But Summer is a Stark now. If you hurt her, you're not just dealing with her anymore—you're dealing with the entire Stark family. If anything happens to Summer or her baby, forget about the shares—the Taylor family and Capital Corp would be finished!"
Victoria swallowed hard, the reality of what she'd almost done sinking in. "What do you suggest we do then?" she asked Sophie.
###Chapter314

Summer's POV

"Apologize." Sophie Said.

"You let ME apologize to HER?" Victoria's voice went up another octave.

"Do you still want those shares or not?" Sophie snapped,grabbing Victoria's arm. "Don't forget she's still your boss at Stark Entertainment. Brandon is your boss. Summer is too!"

I watched Victoria's face contort as this reality sank in. The thought of acknowledging me as her superior clearly made her physically ill.

Sophie turned to me with a placating smile. "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Stark.Victoria didn't mean to... she was just startled."

"Victoria." I raised an eyebrow. "Moving around so dramatically-aren't you worried about throwing your back out?"

Victoria's jaw tightened at my sarcasm. Sophie nudged her hard.

"I'm sorry," Victoria finally ground out, the words clearly causing her physical pain.

I tilted my head. "What was that? I couldn't quite hear you."

"I said I'm SORRY!" Victoria practically shouted.

I studied her. "So, Victoria, does this mean you still want those shares?The ones I told you I sold months ago?"

"Summer, don't play games. Those shares belong to the Taylor family-to me."


"Funny," I replied calmly,′′Idon't remember them having your name on
them.Grandpa George specifically gave them to me."

"Summer." Victoria's voice dropped to a threatening whisper. "you've sold out our family. You gave away Taylor family assets to outsiders."

I shrugged. "I sold something that belonged to me. And by the way,Grandpa George knew about it. I asked for his permission before selling them."

Victoria's face went slack with shock. "That's impossible. Grandfather would never agree to that."

"Why would I lie? Call him and ask if you don't believe me."

"This can't be... Who did you sell them to?"

I smiled slightly. "That's none of youar business. But I can tell you this-they're in good hands."

"What kind of twisted game are you playing? Those shares are our family s legacy!"

"I had every right to sell them," I replied firmly. "And about that envelope you're holding-what exactly do you think is in there that could possibly threaten me now?"

Victoria clutched the envelope tighter. "You might be married to Brandon Stark,but do you think he'll stay with you when he sees what you really are? When he sees what happened that night by the river?"

Her words sent an involuntary chill down my spine, but I kept my expression neutral. "Go ahead, Victoria. Show everyone. I have nothing to hide."


"Mrs. Stark!" Desmond's voice cut through our conversation.

I turned to see him approaching our table, his imposing figure drawing
stares. Victoria and Sophie visibly paled.

"Mr. Stark asked me to accompany you," Desmond said. standing beside me.

Sophie tugged at Victoria's sleeve. "Let's go. Victoria."

"Wait. Miss Taylor," I called as they turned to leave. Victoria froze,and Desmond immediately stepped between them and the exit.

"What do you want?" Victoria stammered.

"Desmond, please make sure Miss Taylor returns what belongs to me."

Victoria clutched her purse tighter. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"The envelope, Victoria. Give it to me now."

"This is ridiculous!" Victoria tried to push past Desmond. "You can't just-"


In one swift motion; Desmond took Victoria's purse and emptied the contents onto a nearby table. Among the items was the sealed envelope.

"This, Mrs. Stark?" Desmond asked, holding it up.

"Yes, thank you," I nodded.

Victoria lunged for it, but Desmond easily kept it out of her reach.

"This is theft!" Victoria hissed. "I'll call the police!"

"Please do," Desmond replied calmly. "I'm sure Mr. Stark's lawyers would be interested in discussing why you were using it to threaten his wife."

Victoria's face drained of color as she stuffed her belongings back into her purse.
"This isn't over. Summer," she spat, but her voice lacked conviction.

"I believe it is." I replied. "Goodbye. Victoria."

Sophie practically dragged Victoria out, both stumbling in their haste to escape.

Outside. Brandon's sleek black car waited at the curb. My heart skipped as 1 slid in beside him, clutching the envelope.

"Brandon!" I exclaimed, relief washing over me.

His expression was unreadable. "Didn't I tell you to leave these matters to me?" He glanced at the envelope. "What's that you're holding?"

"I... I'll show you, but please don't get angry?"

Brandon opened the envelope to reveal several photographs-but not of me. They were modeling shots of Victoria.

"You came here for these?" Brandon asked, brow furrowed.

"I don't understand," I stammered. "Victoria said she had photos of me from when I was fifteen, from when I was found by the East River."

Brandon's expression darkened. "Summer, come here." He pulled me closer."What were you going to tell me just now?"

I took a deep breath. "When I was fifteen, I went missing for three days.When they found me, I was by the East River,barely conscious, with torn clothes. I don't remember much-just fragments, nightmares really."

I paused. "Grandpa and my maternal grandfather told me I'd been kidnapped. I always thought Victoria saved me that day. Victoria said she knew what happened and had photos from that day."

Brandon's arms tightened around me. "And you were worried about how
I would react? That I might think less of you?"

I nodded, unable to meet his eyes.

"Summer," Brandon saidsoftly, lifting my chin, "whatever happened to you-it doesn't matter to me. Nothing would ever change how I feel about you.Nothing."

His intensity startled me. "Brandon, I don't understand why you're so absolute about this."

"Nothing and no one will ever be more important to me than you.Not even myself. Do you understand?"

Tears welled in my eyes at his conviction.

"Brandon," I said hesitantly, "I have a favor to ask. Please don't go after my family yet. Just Victoria."

Brandon studied me. "You're worried about George."

I nodded. "Yes. He's been good to me."

"Alright," Brandon agreed. "For now, I'll only deal with Victoria."

"Thank you," I whispered, leaning against his shoulder.

By the time we reached The Hamptons, I was exhausted. Brandon carried me upstairs and gently laid me on our bed.

"Sleep," he said softly, brushing hair from my face. "We'll talk more tomorrow."

As I drifted off, I felt Brandon's hand in mine, a constant, reassuring presence. The last thing I saw before sleep claimed me was his face,watching over me with unwavering devotion.
###Chapter315

Summer's POV

I was jolted awake by Brandon's voice,his face hovering above mine in the dim light of our bedroom. The serious expression he wore immediately set off alarm bells in my head.

"Summer, wake up," he said, his voice unnaturally tense. "Parker just called. Your grandfather collapsed and is unconscious. They've rushed him to Manhattan General for emergency treatment."

My mind snapped from groggy to fully alert in an instant."What?Grandpa George?" I sat up so quickly I nearly knocked heads with Brandon. "How? Why? What happened to him?"

"I don't know all the details yet," Brandon replied, already moving to grab clothes for both of us. "But we need to go now."

"Oh my god," I mumbled, my hands shaking as I pulled on the clothes Brandon handed me. "He was fine yesterday when I spoke to him. How could this happen?"

Brandon's strong hands steadied mine. "He's going to be okay, Summer. I promise. The best doctors will take care of him."




The hospital corridor was blindingly bright after our midnight drive. As soon as we stepped off the elevator, I spotted Jenkins pacing near the emergency operating room doors. His normally composed face was drawn with worry.

"Jenkins!" I rushed toward him. "How is he? What happened?"

The elderly man turned to me, relief washing over his features. "Mrs. Stark,
Mr.Stark, thank goodness you're here. The doctors are with him now,but they haven't told us anything yet."

"What happened?" I pressed, my voice cracking. "Was he having chest pains? Did he fall?"

Jenkins's gaze drifted over my shoulder, and I followed it to see Victoria sitting on a bench against the wall. She looked completely shell-shocked,her usually perfect makeup smudged,her eyes vacant.

"Miss Victoria went to see Mr. Taylor this evening," Jenkins said carefully."I heard raised voices from his study. WhenI went to check, I found Mr.Taylor collapsed on the floor and Miss Victoria standing there, frozen."

I stared at Victoria, a horrible suspicion forming in my mind. "Victoria was arguing with Grandpa? About what?"

Before Jenkins could answer, my mother's shrill voice cut through the corridor. "This is completely normal for a man his age! People collapse all the time!"

Elizabeth stalked toward us, her heels clicking aggressively against the tile floor. "Summer, I should have known you'd rush over here to play the devoted granddaughter."

"Mother, not now," I said firmly, turning back to Parker.

"This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't been filling his head with lies!" Elizabeth continued, her voice rising. "Always manipulating him against us!"


I whirled around. "The last time Grandpa had a stroke wasn't random either, was it? You people just won't leave him alone!"

Elizabeth's face contorted with rage. "How dare you! What exactly are you implying?"
"I'm not implying anything." I shot back. "I'm asking directly-what did you do to Grandpa? What did Victoria do?"

"Summer!" My father's stern voice interrupted as he approached from the elevator. "That's enough. Show some respect to your mother."

I could feel Brandon standing silently beside me, his eyes scanning the Taylor family with calculating precision. His gaze lingered on Victoria, who still hadn't moved or spoken.

"Tve called Dr. Sullivan," Brandon said suddenly, his voice cutting through the tension. "He'll be bringing specialists to look after your grandfather."

Jenkins visibly relaxed. "Thank you, Mr. Stark. That's very thoughtful."

Elizabeth's eyes narrowed at Brandon. "We don't need your charity. The hospital doctors are perfectly capable-"

"This isn't up for discussion," Brandon interrupted coldly.

Just then, the elevator doors opened, and Dr. Sean strode out with two other doctors. He nodded briefly to us before heading straight for the operating room.

"Brandon," Dr. Sean called over his shoulder. "A word,please?"

Brandon squeezed my hand reassuringly before following Sean down the corridor.


Left alone with my family, I turned my attention back to the operating room doors. The thought of losing my grandfather was unbearable.He was the only one who had ever truly loved me unconditionally.

I was so lost in my thoughts that I didn't notice Elizabeth approaching until she was right in front of me.

"Summer, you disaster-bringing bitch!" she hissed, her face contorted with
rage.
The shock of the blow left me momentarily stunned. My cheek burned,and I tasted blood where my teeth had cut into my inner lip.

"Every time something bad happens to this family. you're involved!"Elizabeth continued. "You need to return those Taylor shares to the family immediately," she demanded.

I turned my gaze to Victoria. "Speaking of shares, Victoria came to see me today,demanding I return my shares. Then she stormed off in a rage.And now, mysteriously, my grandfather is in critical condition after an argument with her."

Victoria suddenly jerked to attention. "Summer, you evil bitch!" she shrieked. "You did this on purpose! You sent me to confront Grandfather knowing it would upset him! You made me argue with him! You made me make him angry! What kind of sick game are you playing?"

The corridor fell silent as Victoria's outburst echoed off the walls.

"You went to see Grandpa?" I stepped closer to her. "You argued with him? About the shares?"

Victoria's eyes widened as she realized what she'd admitted. "No, I-I didn't mean-"


"Jenkins was there," I pressed. "He heard you arguing with Grandpa before he collapsed."

"It wasn't like that!" Victoria tried to backpedal.

Elizabeth, seeing her daughter cornered, rushed toward me again. "Summer,you manipulative little-"

A pained scream cut through the air as Elizabeth suddenly crumpled to
the floor, clutching her stomach. I had backed up instinctively, but before Elizabeth could reach me. Brandon had appeared out of nowhere.positioning himself between us and pulling me protectively against his chest.

"Find another death wish," Brandon said, his voice deadly quiet as he stared down at Elizabeth writhing on the floor. His gaze shifted to Victoria and Richard, who stood frozen in shock. "Very impressive. I can't even bear to touch my wife too roughly, yet you think you have the right to strike her?"


Richard knelt beside Elizabeth, who was moaning dramatically. Victoria stood paralyzed, unable to move toward her mother or away from Brandon's intimidating presence.

Brandon's arm tightened around my waist. "I warned you before," he said,his voice so cold it sent shivers down my spine. "Anyone who touches her deals with me."
###Chapter316

Summer's POV

I stood frozen in Brandon's protective embrace.

Richard helped Elizabeth to her feet, his face pale with fear. He glanced nervously between his wife and Brandon.

"That um... Stark, I mean. Brandon..." Richard stammered, clearly trying to defuse the situation.

Brandon's icy gaze swept over to Richard, silencing him instantly. I felt Brandon's armn tighten around my waist, his body radiating controlled fury.

The elevator doors opened, and Sean strolled out, taking in the scene with raised eyebrows.

"Well,well," Sean said, his casual tone contrasting sharply with the tension."I step away for five minutes and all hell breaks loose." He walked toward us, hands in his pockets, looking completely unfazed. "This is quite the family reunion, isn't it? You've barely been gone, brother, and your wife's already being bullied!"

Elizabeth cowered behind Richard as Sean approached, his smile not reaching his eyes.

"It was an accident," Elizabeth whispered, her voice trembling. "I didn't mean to-"

Victoria stepped forward, her face pale. "You don't understand.Summer is trying to-"

"I understand perfectly," Sean interrupted. "I understand that you two put a frail elderly man in my operating room because you were harassing him about money. And now you're attacking his granddaughter in a hospital
corridor."

Elizabeth crawled toward Richard, seeking protection. "Richard, Richard,tell him I didn't mean it!" she pleaded.

"Summer." Richard said tentatively. "Please, can we all just calmn down and focus on your grandfather's condition?"

I stepped away from Brandon, my voice steady despite my racing heart."They may have put my grandfather in that operating room, but I won't let them get away with it." I turned to Jenkins,who had been watching silently from the side. "You were there. What exactly happened before my grandfather collapsed?"

"Miss Victoria was indeed visiting Mr. Taylor this evening," Jenkins confirmed, his voice calm but firm. "There was a heated discussion about the company shares. I heard Miss Victoria demandíng that Mr. Taylor convince Summer to return her shares to the family."

Elizabeth's face drained of color. "You're lying! Parker, you've always favored Summer!"


Just then, the operating room doors swung open. A doctor in surgical scrubs approached Sean, his expression grave.

"Dr. Sullivan," the surgeon said quietly.

"How is Mr. Taylor?" Sean asked, his playful demeanor completely gone.

The surgeon shook his head. "Mr. Taylor suffered a massive myocardial infarction. We did everything we could, but he didn't make it. I'm sorry, he's gone."

The world seemed to stop spinning. I felt my knees buckle,and Brandon's strong arms caught me before I hit the floor.
"What did he say?" I whispered, staring at Sean. "Sean, what did he mean?
0

Sean's face softened with genuine sympathy. "Summer.."

"No," I gasped, clutching Brandon's arm. "That can't be right. Brandon.what did Sean say? Brandon, Grandpa is still being treated, right? He's going to be okay, isn't he?"

Brandon's arms tightened around me, his voice gentle but firm. "Summer,you need to calm down and listen to me."

"No, no, no," I shook my head frantically. "This isn't happening. Grandpa can't be gone. He was fine yesterday! We talked on the phone, he was laughing,he was..."

"Summer," Brandon said, turning me to face him. "Summer, your grandfather has passed away. You have to face this reality, okay?"

I stared into Brandon's eyes, searching for any sign that this was all some horrible mistake. But his expression was solemn, his eyes filled with concern and sadness.

"But why, Brandon?" My voice cracked as tears began streaming down my face. "Why did he suddenly die? Why,why?"

Brandon pulled me against his chest as I broke down completely.Through my tears, I heard Elizabeth's wailing and Victoria's sobs, but they sounded distant, as if coming from another world.




Brandon led me to my grandfather's hospital room, where they had moved his body. I stood in the doprway, my eyes fixed on the still form on the bed. He looked peaceful, as if he were merely sleeping, but the absence of the steady rise and fall of his chest told the devastating truth.
I approached slowly, my vision blurred with tears. The doctors were completing final procedures, checking machines and filling out forms.

The door burst open behind me, and Elizabeth stormed in, her face tear-streaked but her eyes burning with rage. Richard followed close behind.

"You!" Elizabeth screamed, lunging toward me. "You cursed child! How dare you show your face here after what you've done!"

Brandon stepped between us, grabbing Elizabeth's wrist as she raised her hand.

"Mrs. Taylor," Brandon's voice was low and dangerous. "I've shown restraint out of respect for your father, but this does not mean I will continue to tolerate your behavior."

Elizabeth yanked her hand free. "Brandon Stark, who do you think you are? This is a family matter!" She turned to me, her voice rising to a shriek.
"Summer, you've brought nothing but bad luck to this family since the day you were born!"

"I just wanted to see Grandpa one last time," I whispered, my voice breaking.

"I know what you're really after!" Elizabeth sneered. "You and your husband are just waiting to get your hands on the Taylor fortune, aren't you?" She turned to the medical staff. "We're taking my father's body now.Get the paperwork ready,"

Richard signed the necessary forms while Elizabeth glared at me. I stood rooted to the spot, watching as they prepared to take my grandfather away.

"Can I just... can I have one more minute with him?" I pleaded.

"No!" Elizabeth snapped. "You've done enough damage. Get out!"
I stood in the doorway, watching helplessly as they wheeled my grandfather's body out of the room.

As they disappeared down the corridor, the full weight of my loss crashed down on me. My grandfather-my protector, my champion, the only person who had ever truly loved me unconditionally-was gone forever.

I collapsed against the wall, sobs wracking my body. Brandon stood beside me,his presence solid and comforting, but even he couldn't fill the gaping hole that had just opened in my heart.

"He's gone,Brandon," I cried. "Grandpa's gone. What am I going to do without him?"

Brandon wrapped his arms around me, holding me close as I sobbed uncontrollably. Icried until my throat was raw and my eyes burned. And finally, exhausted beyond measure, I cried myself to sleep in Brandon's arms.
###Chapter 317

Summer's POV

It had been three days since grandpa George was gone.

The drizzling rain had finally stopped by the time Brandon and I made our way up the hill to Grandpa's grave at Ridgeline Park Cemetery. The rest of the Taylor family had already left, their black umbrellas disappearing down the winding path like a procession of crows.

My body felt hollow, drained of everything but grief. My legs trembled with each step, threatening to give out entirely.

"Summer," Brandon said softly, his eyes filled with concern. "You're exhausted."

Before I could protest, he swept me into his arms, cradling me against his chest as if I weighed nothing. I didn't have the strength to argue. Instead,I rested my head against his shoulder, breathing in his familiar scent as he carried me up the steep path.

When we reached Grandpa's grave, the freshly turned earth was still dark against the green grass. His headstone was simple but elegant,with his photograph-smiling that warm, kind smile I knew so well-protected behind glass. In that moment, looking at hisface,the reality of his absence hit me all over again.

"Grandpa," I whispered, my voice breaking. "I miss you so much." I reached out to touch his photograph, my fingers trembling. "Are you missing me too?"


Brandon set me gently on my feet but kept his arm around my waist.supporting me as I swayed slightly, I couldn't remember the last time I'd slept properly. The days since Grandpa's collapse had blurred together in a haze of grief and exhaustion.
Brandon stepped forward, his expression solemn as he addressed my grandfather's grave. "Sir. I promise you. I'll take care of Summer. You have my word."

I clutched Brandon's arm, suddenly remembering something vitally important. "Brandon," I said urgently, "Capital Corp-you have to get control of it. You must save Capital Corp. It was Grandpa's life's work. We can't let it fall apart now."

Brandon's eyes met mine, firm and determined. "I will," he promised simply.

"Miss Summer."

I looked up to see Jenkins, Grandpa's longtime butler, approaching us. His weathered face was lined with grief, but he maintained his dignified bearing.

"Jenkins," I acknowledged, my voice barely above a whisper.

"The reading of Mr. Taylor's will is scheduled for tomorrow at the Taylor residence," he informed me. "Youar presence is requested. It's important that you attend."

I blinked in confusion. "Will? When did Grandpa make a will? I didn't know anything about this."

"It was drawn up quite some time ago," Jenkins explained. "You are mentioned specifically, which is why your attendance is required."

I nodded numbly, still processing this information.

"After the will is read," Jenkins continued, his voice dropping slightly,"this old man will be returning to the countryside. Take care of yourself, Miss Summer."
His words took a moment to register. "You're leaving too?" I asked, unable to hide the shock in my voice.

Jenkins nodded, his eyes sad but resolute. "It's time. Mr. Taylor was the last thing keeping me in the city."




The next day. I approached the Taylor family mansion with a sense of dread. It had been my childhood home, but it had never felt like one. Now,without Grandpa's presence, it felt even more unwelcoming.

As I entered the grand foyer, I felt the weight of hostile stares from various Taylor relatives. An aunt I barely knew stepped forward,her face twisted with disdain.

"What are you doing here?" she demanded.

Before I could respond, Jenkins appeared at my side. "Summer is here at my request," he stated firmly. "Today's will reading concerns her as well."

The aunt retreated, muttering under her breath, but continued to glare at me from across the room.


A few minutes later, a distinguished-looking man in a tailored suit arrived.He introduced himself as Andrew Phillips, Grandpa's attorney.

"Good afternoon, everyone," he said, his voice carrying across the room."T m Andrew Phillips, George Taylor's attorney. Mr. Taylor entrusted me with his last will and testament, to be executed according to his wishes following his passing."

He glanced around the room. "I'lI need to confirm the presence of all parties named in the will. Is Richard Taylor present?"

My father raised his hand from where he stood beside my mother.
"Elizabeth Taylor?"

My mother nodded curtly.

"Victoria Taylor?"

There was a pause.

"Victoria is unable to attend due to work commitments," Elizabeth explained smoothly. "Her father and I will represent her interests."

Andrew Phillips nodded, making a note. "And Summer Taylor?"

"Present." I said quietly.

The attorney nodded, seemingly satisfied. "Very well. Let's proceed with the reading."

We moved to the formal living room, where everyone took seats. I sat slightly apart from the others, feeling like an outsider as always.

Andrew Phillips opened his briefcase and removed a sealed envelope.He broke the seal and unfolded several pages of legal documents.

"This is the last will and testament of George Edward Taylor," he began."T Il summarize the key provisions."

He cleared his throat. "First, regarding real estate holdings: The upstate New York residence is bequeathed to his son Richard Taylor and daughter-in-law Elizabeth Taylor."


My parents exchanged satisfied glances.

"Second, regarding business holdings: All shares in Capital Corp and associated companies are bequeathed to his granddaughter, Summer Taylor.

11
The room went deadly silent. I stared at the attorney, certain I had misheard.

"Third,regarding financial assets: Five hundred thousand dollars from his personal accounts is bequeathed to his granddaughter Victoria Taylor. The remainder of his liquid assets is to be donated to the charitable foundations specified in Appendix A."

My mother shot to her feet, her face contorted with disbelief. "What did you say?" she demanded. "There must be some mistake!"

My father stood as well, his face ashen. "That can't be right. Check again!"

Andrew Phillips remained perfectly composed. "There is no mistake, Mr.and Mrs. Taylor. I drafted this will myself under Mr. Taylor's explicit instructions. He was of sound mind when he signed it, and it has been properly witnessed and notarized."

I sat frozen in my chair, unable to process what I'd just heard. Grandpa had left me his shares? All of them? Why hadn't he ever mentioned this to me?


My mother turned to me, her eyes blazing with fury. "What did you do?"she hissed. "How did you manipulate him into this?"
###Chapter 318

Summer's POV

I shook my head, still in shock. "I didn't know anything about this, I swear."

"Liar!" she spat. "You've always been his favorite, always whispering in his ear,turning him against us!"

Andrew Phillips intervened. "Mrs. Taylor, I can assure you that these were Mr. Taylor's wishes, expressed to mne clearly and repeatedly over the years.He was quite adamant about the distribution of his assets."

My father sank back into his chair, looking stunned.

As the reality of the situation began to sink in, I felt a strange mix of emotions. GrieF for my grandfather, shock at his unexpected bequest, and a growing sense that he had given me not just shares in a company, but a final, powerful statement of his love and faith in me.

And somewhere beneath it all, a tiny flicker of something I hadn't felt in days-purpose.

"It must have been you," Elizabeth spun toward me, eyes narrowed to slits.
"You must have done something, said something to him,right? That's why the old man lost his mind and created this absurd will."

Walter cleared his throat. "Mrs. Taylor, I must ask you to refrain from making baseless accusations. To suggest that I or my firm would participate in any manipulation of a client's will is not only offensive but potentially libelous."

"I don't care!" my mother snapped, lunging forward and grabbing Walter's arm, "You're in this together, aren't you? You and her conspired to alter my father-in-law's will! How much did she pay you?"
Walter jerked his arm away, anger flashing across his face. "Mrs. Taylor.show some respect! I've been the Taylor family attorney for over twenty years. If you continue with these unfounded accusations, I will have no choice but to consider legal action for defamation."

My father, who had been uncharacteristically quiet, finally spoke up."Collins, can you absolutely guarantee the authenticity of this will? There's no possibility of... irregularities?"

Walter straightened his jacket. "If you have doubts, Mr. Taylor, you're welcome to hire another attorney to examine it. Or take this matter directly to court. I assure you, my firm will be more than prepared to defend the legitimacy of this document."

He turned to me and Jenkins, giving uas a slight nod before walking out.

I remained seated, trying to process everything. I hadn't expected Grandpa to give all the shares to me alone instead of my father or Victoria.

My mother marched toward me. "You," she hissed, "give everything back.Right.Now."

I looked up at her, seeing the raw fury in her eyes. Before today,I would have gladly signed everything over without a second thought.

But looking at Elizabeth's twisted expression, something shifted inside me.*This woman has never shown me an ounce of motherly love.*

"What if I don't?" I asked quietly.


Elizabeth's eyes widened in shock. "Then you won't be leaving this house today!"


Suddenly, through the windows, I could see men-at least a dozen-surrounding the mansion. They carried baseball bats and what looked disturbingly like guns. The front door burst open, and several men entered.
forming a circle around Jenkins and me.

"Summer." Elizabeth said, voice dripping with false sweetness, "be reasonable. Just hand over Capital Corp's shares, and we'll let you leave without trouble. If not..." She gestured toward the men. "Think carefully.You're carrying a Stark heir in your belly. You wouldn't want anything to happen to either of you. would you?"

I felt my eyebrows knit together in disbelief. I knew my mother was ruthless,but this? Threatening violence against her own pregnant daughter?

"What are you doing?" My father stared at Elizabeth in shock. "Have you lost your mind? Why are these men here?"

Elizabeth turned to him dismissively. "Don't be naive, Richard.Are you going to let Capital Corp fall into this ungrateful girl's hands? We have the advantage now-there are so many of us and just two of them."

She turned back to me. "Last chance,Summer."

I looked at my father, searching for any sign he might intervene, but he just stood there, silent. *As always.*

"Mrs. Taylor, do you honestly think I scare that easily?"

Elizabeth's smug expression faltered.

"Richard," I said, "I know you've always been weak, but even you must see how insane this is. She's threatening your pregnant daughter with violence.11


Richard shifted uncomfortably but said nothing.

Elizabeth nodded to one of the men. "Don't be stubborn, Summer.Just sign the papers, and this will all be over."
I straightened my spine. "This is what Grandpa left me. and I'm not giving it to you."

"You leave me no choice," Elizabeth snapped, gesturing to the men. "Get her to sign."

The men started closing in, but before they could take another step, the front door burst open again. A group of men in black suits swarmed in,quickly disarming Elizabeth's hired muscle. The thugs were on the ground in seconds.

Desmond, Brandon's head of security, strode in calmly.

"Mrs. Stark," he called out, "are you alright?"

I couldn't help but smile at his perfect timing. "I'm fine, Desmond."

Desmond nodded, then turned to the room. "Now, which one of you was planning to harm Mrs. Stark?" His voice was deceptively casual, but his eyes were cold as ice.

Elizabeth had gone pale, her legs visibly trembling.

Desmond walked toward her, cracking his knuckles. "So you're the one who wanted to hurt our Mrs. Stark? You should know that Mr. Stark doesn't take kindly to threats against his wife."

Elizabeth's face had lost all color."I-I didn't-"

"Save it," Desmond cut her off. "Your hired help already sang like canaries outside." He leaned closer.′′Ifyou ever think about hurting Mrs. Stark again, you'll have to deal with me first."

"Desmond," I called, "howv's Brandon? Is he okay?"

"Mr. Stark is in an emergency meeting right now. He sent me to escort you home safely." He gestured to his men. "What would you like us to do with
these... gentlemen?"

I looked at the thugs, then at Elizabeth and Richard. For a moment. I considered letting them all go but then I remembered the very real threat they'd posed not just to me, but to my unborn child.

"Take them to the police station," I said firmly. "All of them."

Desmond nodded, a hint of approval in his eyes. "As you wish. Mrs. Stark.

”

As he led me toward the door, I couldn't help but notice how nervous he seemed, constantly checking his watch and the surroundings. It was almost funny-Brandon's most intimidating security chief, acting like an anxious babysitter.
###Chapter 319

Summer's POV

I woke up the next morning feeling surprisingly well-rested despite everything that had happened. As I made my way downstairs, I found Brandon in his home office, his expression tense as he typed rapidly on his laptop.

"Hey," I said softly, leaning against the doorframe.

Brandon looked up, his features immediately softening. "Morning. How are you feeling?"

I walked over and perched on the edge of hís desk. "I'm okay. But I've been thinking about Victoria."

"What about her?" His tone turned cautious.

"I want her to pay for what she did to Grandpa George." My voice came out harder than I'd intended. "She basically admitted to causing his heart attack. Can we... I don't know, handle this ourselves? Outside the legal system?"

Brandon studied me for a moment, then closed his laptop. " I understand how you feel. And I would gladly make her suffer for hurting you and your grandfather." He sighed, running a hand through his hair. "But there s a problem. Victoria's missing."

"Missing?" I blinked in surprise.

"Yes. And Sophie too. I've been trying to contact Sophie since yesterday.but she's not answering her phone."

I frowned. "Do you think they're together?"

"Possibly. I have people looking for them." He reached for my hand."As
soon as we find Victoría, I promise you, she'll pay for everything she's done."

I nodded, trying to push down the burning anger I felt whenever I thought about Victoria's smnug face as she basically admitted to killing my grandfather.




Living with Jane Sinclair for month had turned out better than I expected.After our initial rocky start, we'd developed a surprisingly comfortable relationship. I could tell she appreciated how I'd helped bridge the gap between her and Brandon, healing their fractured mother-son relationship.

Later that morning, I was sorting through some paperwork in the living room when Jane came downstairs, dressed elegantly as always.

"Let me help you with those!" she said, hurrying over when she saw me organizing files.

"It's fine, I've got it-" I started, but she was already taking the folders from my hands.

"Nonsense! You're pregnant and shouldn't be straining yourself." She gestured toward the couch. "Sit down and rest. I'll handle these."

I smiled and relented,settling onto the plush sofa. "Thank you, Jane."

She began organizing the papers with surprising efficiency. "Brandon's been so busy lately. I barely see him around the house."

"The Stark Group is demanding," I agreed. "There's always some crisis that needs his attention."


She hesitated, then set the papers down. "Summer. I need to apologize for my behavior when we first met. I was... difficult."
"That's putting it mildly," I said with a small laugh, then quickly added,"But that's all in the past now. We're getting along great, aren't we?"

Jane smiled, relief evident in her eyes. "Yes, we are. And I'm grateful for that."

As she returned to organizing the files, I suddenly remembered something important. "Oh mygod!" I exclaimed, sitting up straight.

"What's wrong?" Jane asked,alarmed.

"I completely forgot! I have an appointment with Dr. Miller today for my prenatal checkup. I've been so focused on these reports that it slipped my mind."

"What time is your appointment?"

I checked my watch. "In about an hour. I should go get ready."

Jane set the files aside. "I'll come with you," she offered.

I looked at her in surprise. "You don't have to do that."

"I want to," she insisted. "Brandon's too busy right now, and you shouldn't go alone.Besides," she added with a tentative smile, "I'd like to be there for my grandchild."

The sincerity in her voice touched me. After everything we'd been through.this felt like a significant step forward. "I'd appreciate that, thank you."

As I headed upstairs to get ready, I couldn't help feeling a strange mix of emotions. Jane accompanying me to my prenatal appointment felt both surreal and oddly right. She seemed genuinely excited about becoming a grandmother, and I was glad we'd moved past our initial hostility.
When we arrived at Manhattan General Hospital, Dr. Miller was already waiting outside her office. Her eyebrows raised slightly when she saw Jane beside me.

"Mrs. Stark!" she greeted, then glanced curlously at Jane.

"Dr. Miller, this is my mother-in-law," I explained.

Jane extended her hand. "Jane Sinclair. Pleased to meet you."

Dr. Miller smiled warmly. "Wonderful to meet you too. Summer, shall we get started with your checkup?"

As Jane settled in the waiting area, Dr. Miller led me into the examination room. At nearly five months pregnant, my babies bump were now clearly visible beneath my loose blouse.

"How have you been feeling?" she asked as she prepared the equipment.

"Pretty good, actually. The morning sickness has finally stopped."

She nodded approvingly. "That's normal for this stage. Let's check on your little one."

The examination went smoothly. Dr. Miller confirmed that all my vitals were normal and the babies were developing perfectly.

"Remember to stay active at home," she advised as I redressed. "Don't sit for too long at a stretch. And don't worry if you experience mood swings-that's completely normal during pregnancy."

"Thank you, Dr. Miller," I said, taking the prenatal vitamins she prescribed.

When I emerged from the examination room with my paperwork, Jane immediately stood up, her face anxious.

"Everything's fine," I reassured her before she could ask. "Dr. Miller says
the babies are healthy, and all my indicators are normal. So you don't need to worry."

Relief washed over Jane's face. "That's wonderful news. Shall we head back to the estate?"

I nodded, saying goodbye to Dr. Miller as we left the obstetrics department.As we walked through the hospital corridor. I suddenly felt uncomfortable.

"Jane,could you wait here for a moment? I need to use the restroom."

"Of course. Do you want me to come with you?"

"No, it's fine. I'll be quick. There's a ladies' room on the second floor that I noticed earlier."

Jane looked hesitant but nodded. "Alright. I'll wait right here in the sitting area."

I headed for the elevator, but as I walked, I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching me. I glanced around the busy hospital corridor but didn't see anyone suspicious. *Just pregnancy paranoia*, I told myself.

The second-floor bathroom was thankfully empty when I entered. As I washed my hands. I frowned at my reflection, still feeling uneasy.Something felt off, but I couldn't put my finager on what.

I was about to leave when the bathroom door swung open. My heart nearly stopped when I saw who entered.
###Chapter 320

Summer's POV

Victoria stood there, her once-perfect appearance now disheveled, her eyes wild with hatred. In her hand was a cloth that reeked of chemicals.

I backed away instinctively. "Victoria?"

"Surprised to see me, Summer?" Her voice was eerily calm, but her eyes blazed with fury. "Betyou didn't expect this."

I kept backing up until I hit the wall. "What are you doing here? Brandon's been looking for you."

She laughed, a hollow sound that echoed off the bathroom tiles. "Of course he has. And it's all because of you. Everything is because of you! If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be in this situation!"

I noticed her hand tightening around the cloth. My mind racing, I slowly reached for my phone in my pocket, trying to dial without looking.

"Where's Sophie?" I asked, hoping to distract her.

Victoria's face contorted with rage. "Sophie? That traitor! I should have known she was your spy all along."

"What are you talking about? And Grandpa George-was it really you who caused his heart attack?"


"So what if it was?" she snarled. "What kind of grandfather would he be,refusing to give me what was rightfully mine? He said he'd rather give those collectibles to an outsider than to me. Can you believe that?"

I shook my head, genuinely bewildered. "I never tried to take anything from you, Victoria. You're the one who's always taken from me-my boyfriend, my parents' love, my dignity."
"You're lying!" she screamed. "You've always been trying to steal my spotlight, my life! And now you've even turned Sophie against me!"

"Where is Sophie?" I demanded again, desperately hoping my phone had connected to someone.

Victoria's laugh turned maniacal. "Don't worry about her. Before coming to find you. I already gave her a few stabs. She's probably bled out by now."

Horror washed over me. "You're insane," I whispered.

Her eyes narrowed as she noticed my hand in my pocket. "Trying to call for help? You think that'll save you?" She lunged forward. "It's too late,Summer. You've wasted enough time."

I tried to dodge, but Victoria was faster than I expected. She grabbed my arm, and we struggled as I tried to push her away. Being pregnant made my movements slower, more cautious.

"You're crazy!" I gasped, fighting to keep the chemical-soaked cloth away from my face. "Victoria, thinak about what you're doing!"

"I've thought about nothing else for weeks," she hissed. "You don't deserve any of this-not Brandon, not Capital Corp, not Grandpa's love. Nothing!"

My purse fell to the floor, and my phone skidded across the tiles. Victoria saw it and became even more enraged.

"You did call someone!" She pulled out a syringe from her pocket. "Too bad they won't get here in time. You know what this is, Summer? It'll make everything look like a natural miscarriage. No one wilI suspect a thing."

I felt cold fear grip my heart. Not just for myself, but for my baby."Victoria, please," I begged, now genuinely frightened. "Don't do this."
"It's too late for begging." She advanced toward me. syringe raised. "If you'd been cooperative. I might have just left your body intact. Now,Summer.it's time to die!"

She lunged at me, and I grabbed her wrist, desperately trying to keep the needle away from my skin. We struggled, my pregnant state making it harder to maintain my balance. The needle inched closer to my arm.

Just when I thought I couldn't hold her off any longer,the bathroom door burst open. Sophie staggered in, blood soaking her clothes,her face deathly pale.

"Victoria,stop!" she cried out.

Victoria's head whipped around in shock. "You're supposed to be dead!"

Sophie used her last strength to lunge at Victoria, crashing into her just as the needle was about to pierce my skin. The impact sent Victoria stumbling, and she hit her head hard against the edge of the sink before crumpling to the floor.

I rushed to check Sophie first, who had collapsed on the floor, multiple stab wounds visible through her blood-soaked clothing.

Then I turned to Victoria, terrified that she might wake up. To my relief,she was still unconscious, blood trickling from where her head had struck the sink.


"Help!" I screamed at the top of my lungs. "Someone help us! There are injured people in here! HELP!"

I knelt beside Sophie, trying to apply pressure to her wounds, my hands quickly becoming covered in her blood.

"Stay with me, Sophie," I pleaded, tears streaming down my face."Please,stay with me. Help is coming."
But Sophie's eyes were already fluttering closed, her breathing shallow and irregular. The bathroom door burst open as hospital staff responded to my screams, but as they rushed in with shocked expressions. I feared it might already be too late.
###Chapter 321

Brandon's POV

The moment Summer's ringtone cut through the boardroom's formal atmosphere. I felt a chill run down my spine. Everyone at the table paused mid-sentence, their eyes darting toward me as I reached for my phone.

I answered immediately. "Summer?"

Nothing. No response from her, but I could hear muffled voices in the background. My wife's voice, tense and frightened, and another voice--one I recognized instantly.

Victoria.

My jaw clenched as I listened, trying to make out what was happening.The voices were distant. like Summer had accidentally called me without realizing it. But what I heard made my blood run cold.

*"You're crazy!"* Summer's voice, desperate and afraid.

*"I've thought about nothing else for weeks,"* Victoria's voice hissed. *"You don't deserve any of this-not Brandon, not Capital Corp, not Grandpa's love.Nothing!"*

My expression darkened as I heard more of their exchange. The executives around the table shifted uncomfortably, sensing the sudden change in my demeanor.

Lawrence, who had been in the middle of presenting quarterly projections.cleared his throat. "Sir, about the Asian markets-"

I held up my hand sharply, silencing the room. My eyes had turned to ice as I continued to listen, catching fragments of the confrontation.

*"...make everything look like a natural miscarriage..."*
C
The words hit me like a physical blow. I stood abruptly,my chair scraping against the floor with a harsh sound that made everyone flinch.

"Meeting's over." I announced, my voice dangerously quiet. Without waiting for a response. I strode toward the door, my movements fluid and purposeful.

James was already on his feet, hurrying to keep pace with me as we exited the boardroom.

"Call Desmond," I ordered the moment we were in the hallway. "Find out where my wife is. Now."

James nodded, immediately pulling out his phone. "Right away, sir."

My fingers were white-knuckled around my own phone,still trying to hear what was happening. The call was still connected, but the voices had become harder to make out. I caught fragments of Sophie's voice now, and the sounds of a struggle.

Then,the call dropped.

"Fuck!" I slammed my fist against the wall, leaving the plaster cracked.

James looked up from his own call, his face grim. "Sir, Desmond says he's at Manhattan General Hospital. Your mother was accompanying Mrs. Stark for a routine checkup today."

My expression grew even darker. "And where the hell was Desmond during all this?"

"He says they wwere waiting outside while-"

"Incompetent!" I spat, already moving toward the elevator."Tell him if anything happens to my wife, his life is forfeit."

The elevator doors opened, and I stepped inside, James following closely.
"Sir. Desmond just reported that there's a situation in the second-floor women's restroom. Security has been alerted.and-"

My jaw tightened as I hit the parking garage button repeatedly."Get the car ready. And keep trying to reach Desmond."

As the elevator descended, my mind raced through scenarios, each worse than the last. If VVictoria had harmed Summer or our baby in any way...

The thought made my blood boil.




I tore through Manhattan traffic, weaving between cars with dangerous precision. My knuckles were white on the steering wheel, my face a mask of cold fury.

By the time I reached Manhattan General, the hospital's second floor had been completely sealed off. I ignored the protests of the front desk staff as I strode toward the elevators, my presence commanding enough that security personnel stepped aside rather than trying to stop me.

When the elevator doors opened on the second floor, I immediately spotted Sean directing a team of medical professionals. The corridor outside the women's restroom was chaotic, with security personnel and medical staff moving urgently.

My eyes locked onto Desmond, who stood by the restroom door looking ashen-faced. The security chief's shirt was stained with blood-not his own.
I realized with growing dread.

Sean looked up as I approached, his professional demeanor briefly giving way to shock as he took in the extent of the situation.

"Sophie's lost a lot of blood," Sean said grimly, gesturing to where paramedics were loading an unconscious woman onto a stretcher."
Multiple stab wounds. She needs surgery immediately."

Desmond stepped forward, his expression haunted. "Dr. Sullivan, I'm sorry-"

"Sorry?" Sean's voice was like ice. "Is that all you have to say? You had one job-to protect them. How could you let this happen?"

I ignored their exchange, my eyes scanning the area frantically. "Where's Summer?" I demanded.

Before anyone could answer, I pushed past them and entered the restroom.The scene inside made my heart stop.

Summer was sitting on a chair someone had brought in, a nurse checking her vitals. Her hands and clothes were stained with blood, but she appeared physically unharmed. On the floor lay Victoria, unconscious.with a security guard standing over her. A syringe had been bagged as evidence nearby.

"Summer," I breathed, crossing the room in three long strides.

Summer looked up, her face pale with shock. "Brandon," she whispered,relief washing over her features.

I knelt before her, my hands gently cupping her face. "Are you hurt? The babies?"

"We're okay," she assured me, her voice trembling. "But Sophie-Victoria stabbed her. She saved my life, Brandon. Victoria was going to inject me with something..."

My expression darkened dangerously as I turned to look at Victoria's unconscious form. I rose slowly, my movements deliberate as I approached her.
###Chapter 322

Brandon's POV

"What happened?" I asked, my voice eerily calm.

Desmond had followed me into the restroom, standing by the door with his head bowed. "Sir, I failed you. I should have-"

I moved with lightning speed. My foot connected with Desmond's chest,sending the security chief stumbling backward.

"What happened?" I repeated, my voice dropping to a dangerous whisper.

Desmond steadied himself, not fighting back. "It's my fault, Sir. I failed you."

I kicked him again, harder this time, sending Desmond crashing into the wall. The security chief coughed, blood spattering his lips, but he made no move to defend himself.

"Brandon," Summer called softly, her voice the only thíng that could have reached me in that moment.

I turned, my eyes still dark with rage, but my expression softened slightly as I looked at her. She reached for my hand, and I returned to her side,my protective stance making it clear to everyone present that I would destroy anyone who came near her.

Sean entered the restroom,now wearing surgical gloves. He crouched to examine the syringe that had been bagged.

"Brandon, look at this," he said, holding up the evidence bag. "This appears to be oxytocin in a concentrated dose. It would have induced premature labor or a miscarriage."

My expression turned murderous as I stared at Victoria's unconscious form.
"Is she dead?" I asked, nudging her with the toe of my Italian leather shoe.

"No. just unconscious." Sean replied. "Hit her head on the sink from what I can tell."

"Victoria was waiting for me here," Summer explained, her voice steadier now. "She admitted to causing Grandpa George's heart attack.She was going to use that syringe on me, but Sophie came in and saved me,even though Victoria had already stabbed her multiple times."

I nodded, my mind working quickly. I turned to Desmond, who was still leaning against the wall, blood trickling from his mouth.

"Take her to Manhattan Club," I ordered, my voice devoid of emotion. "The room in the east wing.

Desmond nodded grimly, pushing himself off the wall despite his injuries."Yes,sir."

I turned back to Summer, my hand gently brushing a strand of hair from her face. "Sophie saved you," I said softly. "Sean, you need to save her."

Sean nodded solemnly. "I'll personally oversee her treatment. We're prepping for surgery now."

As medical staff carefully moved Sophie to the operating room, I helped Summer to her feet, keeping her close to my side. My arm remained protectively around her waist as we watched Victoria being carried away by Desmond's team.




Hours later, I stood in the darkened corridor outside the infamous room in Manhattan Club's east wing. Through the smnall window in the door,I could see Victoría strapped to a chair, her head lolling as she began to
regain consciousness.

Desmond approached, his face bruised but his demeanor professional once more. "She's awake, sir. My men have made sure she understands the gravity of her situation."

I nodded, my expression unreadable. "Good."

I pushed open the door and stepped inside. Victoria's head snapped up at the sound, her eyes widening with fear when she saw me enter.

"Brandon Stark," she spat, though her voice trembled. "A man bullying a woman. How very heroic of you!"

I didn't respond. I simply circled her chair slowly, like a predator sizing up its prey. From my pocket, I withdrew a military-grade knife, the blade gleaming in the dim light.

Victoria's eyes followed the knife, her bravado faltering. "Brandon,you can't do this. This is murder. This is illegal. Brandon..."

Her words dissolved into a scream as I moved closer, the knife now inches from her face.

"You tried to harm my wife," I said, my voice terrifyingly calm. "You tried to kill my child. You should paythe price."

Victoria began to shake uncontrollably,tears streaming down her face."Please, don't kill me," she begged, all pretense gone now. "Please, I'm begging you!"

I placed the edge of the knife against her arm, and with a swift, precise motion, I cut into her flesh. Victoria's scream echoed off the walls as I carved a small piece from her upper arm, blood immediately flowing from the wound.
"This is just the beginning," I said, holding the bloody knife before her eyes. "Tll take you apart piece by piece until there's nothing left."

Victoria sobbed harder, her makeup running in black streaks down her face."Please don't kill me. Please!"

The more calmly I spoke, the more terrified Victoria became. Her eyes darted wildly around the room, looking for any sign of mercy or escape and finding none. Blood continued to trickle down her arm, staining her dress.

"Wait!" she suddenly cried out, her voice breaking with desperation."Brandon. I have something important!"

I paused, the knife still wet with her blood. "What is it?"

Victoria swallowed hard, her voice shaking. "It's Summer's diary... from before she lost her memory. My parents found it when they were going through Grandpa George's things at the Taylor house... After she lost her memory, she didn't remember writing it, and we didn't think much of it either, so we never looked for it carefully."

My eyes narrowed slightly, the only indication that her words had affected me at all. "Where is it?" I asked. After a pause, I added, "And those photos you took of Summer. Where are they?"
###Chapter 323 The End

Summer's POV

I sat on the edge of our bed at The Hamptons estate,still shaken from everything that had happened at the hospital. My hands trembled slightly as I hugged myself, the memory of Victoria's face-twisted with hatred as she held that syringe-still fresh in my mind. If Sophie hadn't intervened...

The sound of the bedroom door opening made me look up. Brandon stood there, his expression softening immediately when our eyes met. He looked exhausted, the weight of the day evident in the slight slump of his shoulders.

"Hey," he said softly, crossing the room to sit beside me. "How are you feeling?"

I leaned into him as he wrapped his arm around me. "Better now that you're here," I admitted. "Is Sophie..."

"Sean's still with her. The surgery went well, but she's not out of the woods yet." His voice was steady, but I could hear the underlying tension."He'll call as soon as there's any change."

I nodded,swallowing hard. "And Victoria?"

Brandon's expression darkened momentarily. "She's been taken care of.She won't hurt you again."

He didn't elaborate, and I didn't ask for details. Some things were better left unsaid.

"I'm sorry," Brandon said suddenly, pulling me closer. "I should have been there. I should have protected you."

I looked up at him in surprise. "This wasn't your fault."


-	1/4
"It is." he insisted, his jaw tight. "I knew what Victoria was capable of. I should have had better security, should have anticipated-"

I pressed my finger to his lips, stopping his self-recrimination. "You can't control everything. Brandon. Not even you."

He caught mny hand, pressing a kiss to my palm. "When it comes to your safety.I should."

We sat in silence for a moment, the events of the day settling around us like a heavy blanket. Brandon's thumnb traced soothing circles on my shoulder,and gradually, I felt the tension begin to leave my body.

"Why don't we go outside?" he suggested after a while. "Get some fresh air.The garden is beautiful this time of evening."

I nodded, grateful for the distraction. "That sounds perfect."




"Brandon, I... have I met you before? A very longtime ago?"

The question slipped out before I could stop myself. We were sitting in the garden of The Hamptons estate, the evening breeze gentle against my skin.Something about the way Brandon looked at me in that moment-a mixture of tenderness and nostalgia-triggered a strange familiarity that I couldn't place.

My heart fluttered when I asked it, and I could feel heat rising to my cheeks. There was something about Brandon that felt so deeply familiar,like a half-remembered dream.


Brandon's expression softened, his eyes studying mne with an intensity that made my breath catch. "What do you think?" he asked quietly.

I frowned, frustrated by the fog in my mind. "I don't know. That's why I'
m asking. Sometimes when you look at me a certain way, I get this feeling like... like we've known each other forever."

My mind struggled to piece together fragments of memories that seemed just beyond my reach. I knew Brandon was Professor Thompson's student.but there was something more, something I couldn't quite grasp.

"God, why can't I remember anything?" I groaned, lightly tapping my forehead with my knuckles in frustration. "It's all just... blank."

Brandon reached out, gently catching my hand before I could knock on my head again. "Hey, stop that," he saíd, his voice tender. "You'll hurt yourself."

"I don't care," I pouted. "Even if I make myself stupid, I'd still be your wife. You're not allowed to complain!"

A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. "I wouldn't dream of it," he said, pulling me into his arms. "I'd want you no matter what. And don't worry about the past-we have every day ahead of us."

I melted into his embrace, feeling safe and warm, but a nagging sense of unfairness lingered. "It's not fair though," I whispered against his chest."You know everything about us, and I can't remember anything. I feel liker m missing so much."

Brandon was quiet for a moment, his fingers gently stroking my hair.Then he pulled back slightly, looking down at me with amusement dancing in his eyes.

"You know, you weren't always this quiet and well-behaved," he said, a teasing note in his voice.

I pulled away, indignant. "What? That's not true! Both Grandpa George and Grandpa Jonathan always said I was a good girl. I was super well-behaved when I was little!"
Brandon chuckled, clearly enjoying my reaction. "If you say so."

"Well, what was I like then?" I challenged, genuinely curious. "When we first met. I mean. Was it at some fancy party? Did you see me across the room and fall madly in love with me at first sight?"

The last part was meant as a joke, but Brandon's expression turned serious."Yes," he said simply. "I did fall for you at first sight."

His directness caught me off guard, and I felt my cheeks flush again.Before I could respond, Brandon stood up and held out his hand.

"Come with me. I want to show you something."

I followed him inside and up to his study. He went to a drawer and pulled out what looked like an old notebook. The cover was worn,with faded flowers printed on it.

"What's this?" I asked, taking it from him.

Brandon's eyes were gentle as he answered. "It's your diary. From when you were younger... before Victoria had you kidnapped and you lost your memory."

I stared at the notebook in shock. "My diary? How did you get this?"

My fingers trembled slightly as I opened the cover. The handwriting inside was unmistakably mine, though slightly more childish than my current script. I began to read, and with each word, something inside me stirred.
###Chapter 324 The End

Summer's POV

The pages were filled with the thoughts of a younger me-happy moments with Grandpa Jonathan, frustrations about the Taylorhousehold,walking on eggshells around Richard, Victoria, and Elizabeth. But what caught my attention were the frequent mentions of a "tall boy," "Grandpa's student," and "Brandon."

My breath caught in my throat as I read entry after entry about this boy who made my heart race, who was kind to me when others weren't.

I looked up at Brandon, stunned. "This is... this is real? I wrote this?"

He nodded, watching me carefully. "Yes. Those are your words,Summer."

I continued reading, my eyes widening at the detailed descriptions of Brandon-his height, his smile, the way he always seemed to appear when I needed help. I couldn't help but laugh at one particularly enthusiastic entry where I'd drawn hearts around his name.

"Oh my God," I said, looking up at him with a mixture of embarrassment and delight. "You're so handsome. No wonder little me was so obsessed with you!"

Brandon's lips quirked into a smile. "So you believe it now?"

"It's my handwriting," I admitted, still processing everything. "And these details... I couldn't have made them up." I looked at him curiously."Brandon, I forgot you. Does that.,. does that make you angry?"

His expression softened as he sat beside me. "How could I be angry with you? It wasn't your fault."

"But still," I insisted, "to forget someone who was obviously so important
to me... it must have hurt you."

"I thought you just didn't care," he admitted quietly. "When I saw you again after all those years. and you cried for another man... I thought perhaps I hadn't meant as much to you as you had to me."

My heart ached at his words. "Brandon," I asked hesitantly, "what if...what if things had been different? What if I had stayed with Alexander?What would you have done?"

His eyes darkened slightly. "Tht wouldn't have happened."

"But what if it had?" I pressed. "What would you have done?"

Brandon was quiet for a moment, his jaw tightening. "The day you almost got hit by a car outside The Plaza Hotel," he finally said, "I was on my way to find you. I had decided I wasn't going to let you marry him."

I blinked in surprise. "You were going to stop the wedding?"

"I was going to force you to accept my pursuit," he admitted, his voice low and intense. "I wasn't going to give you a choice."

"But what if I'd seen you as some kind of stalker?Or2harasser?"

A hint of arrogance flashed in his eyes. "A harasser as good-looking as me?11


I couldn't help but laugh at his confidence. "And then what happened?"

His expression turned serious again. "Then I saw you crying as you left the hotel, and I was consumed with jealousy. I wanted to know who had hurt you so badly."

I moved closer to him, wrapping my arms around his neck, "So you would have stopped me from marrying Alexander no matter what?"
"Yes," he said without hesitation. "Even without Victoria's interference. I would have found a way."

"That's pretty underhanded." I teased. but my heart was racing at his confession.

"I never claimed to be a good man, Summer," he said, his voice low. "Not when it comes to you."

I tightened my arms around him, overwhelmed by the intensity of his feelings. "I think marrying you is the best, most right decision I've ever made in my life," I whispered.

"Brandon," I said gently, "I still can't remember everything from before.But would you like to tell me more about us? About how we met?"

"Okay," He nodded eagerly. "We can do that."

He smiled, brushing a strand of hair from my face. "Ill tell you everything.But first, I think we have something more important to attend to."

Before I could ask what he meant, Brandon lifted me into his arms and carried me to our bedroom. He placed me gently on the bed, his eyes dark with desire as he leaned down to kiss me.

As his lips met mine, a flash of memory suddenly burst through the fog in my mind. "Brandon!" I gasped,pulling back.

He looked at me with concern. "What is it?"

"Say my name again," I whispered, my heart pounding.

A slow smile spread across his face. "Summer," he murmured, his voice deep and intimate. "My Summer."

I reached up to touch his face, my eyes filling with tears. "I remember," I whispered. "September third. I was visiting Grandpa at the university.I
climbed a tree to look at a bird's nest, but I couldn't get down."

Brandon's eyes widened slightly as he realized what was happening.

"There was a boy in a white shirt under the tree," I continued, the memory becoming clearer with each word. "I stared at him and he stared at me. Oh my,he was cute! The little bird in my hands was chirping, and my heart was pounding so hard!"

"Summer?" Brandon whispered, hope evident in his voice.

I looked into his eyes, feeling a piece of myself slide back into place."Brandon? Is that really what happened?"

He nodded, his hand gently caressing my cheek. "What did you feel that day, when you fell into my arms?"

I smiled through my tears. "Like I'd found something I didn't know I was looking for. And you? What did you feel that day?"

Brandon lowered himself beside me, pulling me close against his chest."That day, when you fell from the tree, landing exactly on my chest,like this," he murmured, "I knew I was done for. One look at you, and that was it for me. For life."

As I lay in his arms, I could almost see it-that tree-lined path at the Columbia,the feeling of falling, and then the safety of his arms catching me. It wasn't everything, not yet, but it wwas a start. A fragment of our beginning.

And as Brandon held me, I knew that even if I never recovered all my memories, we would create new ones-ones so beautiful that they would overshadow anything we might have lost.
