###Chapter 1

Evelyn Carter awoke with a throbbing headache and parched throat in the dead of night.

Her heart had been soaring just hours earlier when she'd finally perfected "Eternal Bloom," the signature fragrance she'd spent years developing. With this triumph at the competition, her wedding to Dominic Reeves would finally move forward.

They'd met during university years - five years of friendship blossoming into three years of romance. Evelyn had sacrificed everything to focus on her perfumery, helping Dominic build his fledgling company from the ground up.

The promise of their future together had made her drink more champagne than usual tonight.

Rubbing her temples, she reached for the water glass on her nightstand. Then froze.

Strange noises were coming from the guest room.

Evelyn lived alone in this apartment. Dominic occasionally stayed over, but always slept separately. The muffled sounds made her worry he might be ill - until a distinctly feminine giggle cut through the darkness.

"Dom, what if Evelyn hears us?"

Though the whisper was hushed, Evelyn recognized that voice instantly. Her blood turned to ice.

Years of late-night perfume formulations had left Evelyn with chronic insomnia. The sleeping pills she'd relied on for years had dulled their effect, leaving her painfully alert now.

"After my new line wins tomorrow, I'll be the most sought-after perfumer in the industry. Investors will be lining up to fund your expansion. How could Evelyn ever compare to me?"

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms as she identified the speaker: Vanessa Blake, her college roommate and closest friend. The rumors she'd refused to believe were true - Vanessa was sleeping with her fiancé.

Dominic's reply was a knife to the heart: "I named the company after us, darling. DR Holdings - Dominic and Vanessa. Lily was just a means to an end. Would I have sabotaged her competition formulas if I truly loved her?"

"I don't want to hear her name," Vanessa purred in that affected, breathy tone Evelyn now found grotesque. "Just tell me who you love."

The sounds that followed made Evelyn physically ill. She clenched her fists until crescent moons bloomed on her palms, the pain anchoring her from storming in. All her sacrifices, her trust - reduced to this sordid betrayal.

Three years ago, Evelyn had been the rising star of perfumery after winning the regional championship. She'd turned down offers from Celestia Group and other industry giants to support Dominic's startup.

When her formulas mysteriously failed at the next major competition, leaving her humiliated as the "perfumer who couldn't smell," Dominic had been her rock. He'd suggested she work behind the scenes while Vanessa became the public face of their creations.

She'd believed they were partners. Turns out she was just a pawn in their game.

The company name she'd thought was random - DR Holdings - was their initials. While she'd poured her soul into building their business, they'd been laughing behind her back.

As dawn approached, Evelyn's fury crystallized into cold resolve. When she finally heard the front door click shut, she moved with purpose.

From her desk drawer, she retrieved a gilded business card embossed with a single name: Alexander Kensington. The CEO of Celestia Group had personally given it to her three years ago. Did he still use this number?

Her hands trembled slightly as the line connected. "Mr. Kensington? This is Evelyn Carter."

A pause. Then that unmistakable baritone: "I remember. The regional championship."

Three words that steadied her. "I have a business proposition. I think you'll find it... interesting."

Another beat of silence. "My office. Nine a.m."

Evelyn's pulse jumped. "Actually, sir, tomorrow may be too late. And your office would be... problematic. Could we arrange an alternative location?"

She held her breath, aware she was pushing her luck. Celestia Group dominated 67% of the beauty market - and Alexander Kensington was its legendary, notoriously uncompromising leader.

Yet she had no choice. The competition launch was tonight. Showing up at Celestia's headquarters would raise questions she couldn't afford.

Three agonizing minutes passed before Alexander responded: "Café Blanc on Magnolia Avenue. Thirty minutes." Before she could thank him, he added, "Bring your passport."

The line went dead.

Evelyn stared at her phone. Had she heard correctly? No time to second-guess. She dressed quickly, opting for a sleek black dress that projected quiet confidence.

The café was close enough that she arrived with minutes to spare. As she reached for the door, a suited man materialized beside her.

"Ms. Carter? Mr. Kensington is waiting." He gestured to a parked limousine where a shadowy figure sat behind tinted windows.

Evelyn didn't hesitate. The door swung open to reveal an interior like a vault - cool, impenetrable. Her eyes adjusted to take in the man's sharp profile, the way his polished Oxfords caught the morning light.

"Good morning, Mr. Kensington. I—"

"Skip the pleasantries." His voice could have frozen the Mediterranean.

Evelyn swallowed hard and met his gaze properly for the first time. The most powerful man in the beauty industry was studying her like a specimen under glass. And she was about to gamble everything on this moment.
###Chapter 2

Evelyn knew she had to be bold when facing someone like Alexander Kensington. Without wasting time, she cut straight to the chase. "I understand Celestia Group is participating in this season's perfumery competition. I have a new formula and would like to join your team."

Alexander regarded her with cool detachment. "We've already selected our participant."

Evelyn wasn't deterred. "But you can submit multiple entries. I'm not here to replace anyone—just to add value."

His gaze sharpened. "Why should I trust you?"

Without hesitation, Evelyn reached into her bag and pulled out a thick folder. "This is the research and data for Eternal Bloom. Consider it proof of my sincerity. Three years ago, you offered me a position, so I assume Celestia Group already recognizes my capabilities." She paused, then added, "I even brought a sample."

His eyebrow lifted slightly. "A sample?"

For the first time since their conversation began, his expression shifted. Intrigued.

Evelyn nodded and extended her hand toward him. A delicate, sweet fragrance drifted through the air—subtle yet intoxicating.

Alexander's gaze dropped to her slender fingers, her fair skin. The scent lingered, teasing his senses.

"I'm confident Eternal Bloom will place in the Top Three," Evelyn said. "It would be the perfect complement to Celestia Group's portfolio."

As she withdrew her hand, Alexander unexpectedly caught her wrist. His grip was firm but not painful. She couldn't pull away, but she didn’t feel trapped either.

"Do you really think Celestia Group needs this?" he asked, voice low.

Evelyn held his gaze. "Consider it a gesture of goodwill. If that’s not enough, I have another offer—Celestia can own the trademarks for all my formulas over the next two years."

She had anticipated resistance. But as long as they were still talking, there was room to negotiate. Time was running out, and Alexander was her best option.

"Still not enough," Alexander murmured, finally releasing her. The ghost of her perfume clung to his fingertips. He lowered his lashes, masking the calculating gleam in his eyes. "Unless… you’re part of the deal."

Evelyn blinked. "M-Me?"

"Did you bring what I asked for earlier?" he said abruptly.

Confused but compliant, she nodded. "Y-Yes, I have it."

"Marry me," Alexander stated, tone indifferent. "And I’ll solve all your problems."

Her breath hitched. Marry him?

Only then did Evelyn notice the limousine was parked directly across from the clerk’s office. He had planned this.

"You can leave if you refuse," Alexander said, opening the door.

Panicked, Evelyn grabbed the handle. "I-I didn’t say no!"

"Then it’s settled." He stepped out, smirking. "Let’s make it quick. I have a meeting at 10:30."

Evelyn stared, stunned. Who rushes into marriage like this?

"Why?" she managed, voice barely above a whisper. "Why me?"

Alexander tilted his head. "Business, Evelyn. You need revenge against DR Holdings. I need a wife. Fair trade."

His casual tone contrasted with the intensity in his gaze—something familiar she couldn’t place.

Evelyn clenched her fists. There was no future with Dominic Reeves anymore. Marrying Alexander, regardless of his motives, wouldn’t hurt her.

"Deal," she said firmly.

She wanted karma to strike that backstabbing couple like lightning.

The paperwork was swift. After leaving the clerk’s office, Alexander tucked away their marriage certificate, slipping on sunglasses to hide his satisfaction. Evelyn hurried after him. "Mr. Kensington, about our collaboration—"

He stopped abruptly, turning to face her. Even through the shades, she felt the sudden chill in his stare.

"From today onward," he said smoothly, "you’ll need to adjust to your new title. Mrs. Kensington."

His arm circled her waist, his breath warm against her cheek. Evelyn’s pulse stuttered.

"Give the formula and sample to Harrison. He’ll handle it."

Then, just as suddenly, he released her and climbed into the limousine, leaving her standing outside.

"Mrs. Kensington," he said, glancing at his buzzing phone, "is there a problem?"

Evelyn swallowed. "C-Can we keep this marriage quiet for now? I have… unfinished business."

His expression was unreadable behind the sunglasses.

"Be at Celestia Group by five," he said before answering the call.

Evelyn closed the door, watching the limousine disappear. But her battle was far from over.

After a quick lunch and a wardrobe change, she drove to DR Holdings. Dominic had called multiple times—she ignored every one.

The moment her car stopped, Lucas Bennett rushed over. "Evelyn! Mr. Reeves has been losing his mind looking for you!"

Three years of hard work, and she was still just a lab technician.

Evelyn strode inside. "What’s wrong?"

Lucas shook his head. "No idea, but it’s urgent."

Only Dominic, Vanessa Blake, and her assistant knew Evelyn was the real force behind DR Holdings’ success. To everyone else, Vanessa was the star.

Evelyn didn’t care about credit before. She cared even less now.

Outside the CEO’s office, Dominic’s furious voice boomed. "You’re with her every damn day, and you’re telling me you don’t know where she is?! Do you think I won’t fire you, Isabella?!"

A phone slammed against the desk.

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. Taking it out on my assistant because you can’t find me?

She knocked and entered. Lucas wisely shut the door behind her.

Crash!

A cup shattered at her feet, ceramic shards grazing her skin.

Dominic’s glare burned into her. "Where the hell have you been all morning?!"
###Chapter 3

Evelyn glanced down at her injured foot before lifting her gaze calmly. "What's the matter?"

"Where are the Eternal Bloom documents? We can't find them in the lab! Do you realize what day it is?"

"Instead of staying at the lab, you chose to go shopping?"

Dominic followed Evelyn's line of sight and noticed the shallow cut on her instep. A flicker of guilt crossed his face, but the urgency of the competition quickly overshadowed it.

"The new product launch and competition start tonight. I thought I still had time, so I picked up a few things to wear for the event."

Before Dominic could respond, Vanessa beside him let out a mocking laugh. "Oh? You're planning to attend?"

"Is there a problem?" Evelyn turned to face her former friend, her voice steady.

Vanessa's smirk widened. "Not at all. I'm just concerned you might feel... out of place. You never liked these events before, did you?"

"That's right. You never cared for fame or socializing. Why don't you stay home and wait for our good news? Now, where are the documents?" Dominic stepped forward, reaching out to pat her shoulder, but Evelyn smoothly sidestepped his touch.

Dominic stiffened, his eyes immediately locking onto the kraft paper bag in Evelyn's hand. "Are the documents ready?" He snatched the bag and rifled through its contents before handing it to Vanessa.

Vanessa accepted it with practiced ease, flipping through the pages with a satisfied smirk. She wasn't completely ignorant about perfumery, but compared to Evelyn, she lacked true talent.

And after latching onto Dominic, she had stopped even trying. Over the years, she had grown complacent, stealing Evelyn's work and basking in the glory of her achievements.

Clutching the documents, Vanessa could practically hear the trophy calling her name. "Where are the samples?" she demanded.

"You can collect them from the lab before you leave for the competition," Evelyn replied.

She watched as the shameless pair exchanged triumphant glances right in front of her. Disgust coiled in her stomach. "Dominic, am I really not allowed to attend tonight?"

Dominic hesitated, then frowned. "Evelyn, what's gotten into you? I'm only looking out for you. Remember what happened at the last competition two years ago? You—"

"I'm not saying it'll fail, but think about it. What if something goes wrong?"

He left the rest unsaid, as if his concern was purely for her sake. If Evelyn hadn't seen the act with her own eyes, she might have been moved to tears. Every word was laced with false kindness, and it made her sick.

"Well, if that's the case, I suppose I'll just wish you both good luck tonight." Evelyn smiled sweetly before turning away. "I'll head back to the lab now."

Dominic nodded eagerly. "Yes, hurry and prepare the samples. Make sure nothing goes wrong, understood?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smirk. Oh, she would make sure nothing went wrong—just not in the way he expected.

On her way out, she dialed Isabella. The voice on the other end was laced with worry. "Evelyn, are you okay? Mr. Reeves has been looking for you all day."

"I know," Evelyn said, eyes fixed on the road. "Isabella, did you prepare what I asked for?"

"It's ready, but you've reformulated Eternal Bloom so many times. Are you sure you want to add the final ingredient now?" Isabella's concern was evident. She had been Evelyn's assistant for years and trusted her instincts completely.

But Evelyn had spent months perfecting Eternal Bloom, and tonight was its grand debut. Isabella couldn't understand why she would alter it at the last moment.

"Do you trust me?"

"Of course I do! But are you really not going to compete in person?" She already knew the answer, but she had to ask. She had seen the blood, sweat, and tears Evelyn poured into every creation.

Evelyn had studied countless bestselling fragrances, yet Vanessa always stole the spotlight. The injustice burned in Isabella's chest.

Evelyn smiled. "What's mine will always be mine," she said softly. "Dominic and Vanessa will collect the samples later. Just do as I instructed. Thank you, Isabella."

"Don't worry. I'll handle it!"

After hanging up, Evelyn pulled into Celestia Group's underground parking lot. The building was massive, its parking garage sprawling beneath the city.

Fortunately, Alexander had prepared everything. Following his directions, she parked and found Harrison waiting for her.

"Ms. Carter, come with me." Harrison quickly briefed her as they rode the private elevator. "We've submitted the documents and samples to the project team. Your fragrance will compete alongside Celestia's other two scents tonight."

"Thank you," Evelyn nodded.

This was already a huge favor from Alexander. Take DR Holdings, for example—they had spent three months preparing for this competition. Adding a new fragrance last-minute was a risk, but Alexander had made it happen.

Harrison summarized the situation in a few words, but Evelyn knew the Celestia team wouldn't accept her entry without resistance. They might even try to sabotage her.

But she had to win—flawlessly.

When she entered Alexander's office, he was seated behind his expansive desk, stacks of documents on either side. He looked up as she stepped in, and for a moment, her pulse quickened.

"Come here," he said, setting down his pen.

Evelyn obeyed. Alexander studied her, his gaze sharp. "Are you hurt?"

Only then did she remember the cut on her foot. She opened her mouth to reassure him, but before she could speak, strong arms lifted her off the ground.
###Chapter 4

Alexander settled Evelyn onto the plush sofa before turning to retrieve the first aid kit. His movements were precise as he selected the antiseptic and a tube of healing ointment.

The cut on Evelyn's ankle had already stopped bleeding during their drive to Celestia Group headquarters. Still, Alexander meticulously cleaned the wound before applying a thin layer of the cooling salve.

Evelyn watched him, mesmerized by the way his dark lashes cast shadows over his sharp cheekbones. His expression remained unreadable, yet his touch was unexpectedly gentle.

Dominic had never tended to her like this. Not once in all their years together.

"Something on your mind?" Alexander's deep voice pulled her from her thoughts as he recapped the ointment.

"N-No," she stammered, quickly lowering her feet to the floor. "Thank you."

A faint smirk touched his lips. "No thanks necessary between husband and wife. Though there is one thing you should remember."

Evelyn nodded, bracing herself.

"The past doesn't concern me," he said, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "But now that we're married, there will be no blurred lines with other men."

"I wouldn't!" The words burst from her before he could finish. "You have my word—I'll honor this marriage completely. I expect the same from you."

Alexander's eyebrow arched in amusement. Few dared make demands of him.

"Our arrangement benefits you, I know," Evelyn continued, lifting her chin. "I don't pretend to understand your reasons, but I have one condition—if you ever want out, we'll divorce cleanly. But cheating?" Her voice turned to steel. "That I won't tolerate."

Not again. Never again.

"How fortunate," Alexander murmured, that infuriating smirk returning. "Neither will I."

For a heartbeat, Evelyn forgot to breathe.

This man was dangerous perfection—a razor-sharp mind wrapped in devastating beauty. What had begun as a business alliance now felt like standing at the edge of a precipice.

At precisely seven that evening, they arrived at the competition venue. Evelyn hadn't expected Alexander to accompany her personally—this provincial contest was beneath Celestia Group's usual international showcases.

Just as their car pulled up, Dominic's sleek black sedan arrived. He stepped out in a tailored navy suit, every inch the dashing CEO before turning to assist Vanessa with theatrical care.

Evelyn's lips curled into a bitter smile. How had she ever been blind to their shamelessness?

"Ready?" Alexander's fingers brushed hers.

"Not yet."

Part of her longed to stride in on Alexander's arm and watch their faces crumble. But that would be too merciful. No, she wanted them to fall from much greater heights.

Inside, the judging was already underway. Three hours earlier, representatives had submitted their fragrances anonymously. Now, industry experts evaluated each scent's complexity—top notes, heart, and lingering base.

Evelyn and Alexander observed from a private VIP suite through a live feed. On screen, Dominic and Vanessa preened like peacocks, already celebrating their assumed victory.

Let them enjoy their moment.

As the lights dimmed for the awards ceremony, the host's voice turned solemn. "Before announcing winners, I must emphasize—this competition values integrity above all. Plagiarism will not be tolerated."

Evelyn's grip tightened around her champagne flute.

Dominic, ever the showman, seized the microphone. "DR Holdings may be small, but we pride ourselves on originality! Plagiarism tarnishes our entire industry!"

Vanessa nodded vigorously beside him. "As a perfumer, I believe in honest craftsmanship above all!"

The audience applauded politely while Evelyn's knuckles turned white.

Then the host delivered the hammer blow: "We have an unprecedented situation—two identical submissions, even in name."

All eyes swung to Dominic as the implication sank in. His smile faltered for the first time all evening.

Evelyn leaned forward, her pulse racing. The trap was sprung. Now, let them writhe.
###Chapter 5

"In the interest of fairness, we've decided to delay announcing the top three winners. Instead, we'll reveal them after further investigation."

The moment the host made this declaration, Dominic Reeves and the entire audience erupted in protest.

"Why postpone the awards? This is unfair to everyone!"

"Disqualify both companies involved in this scandal!"

"At least tell us the names of the two companies!"

The room buzzed with heated arguments, and the reporters, sensing a breaking story, grew even more excited. What was supposed to be a smooth competition had suddenly turned into a controversy—one that would dominate headlines tomorrow.

Dominic, however, remained unshaken. He stepped forward confidently, raising his voice above the chaos. "You're all right! Given the circumstances, the committee should disclose the results immediately. Let the representatives of the accused companies face their peers. That’s the only way to expose the truth!"

While the screen displayed the commotion, Alexander Kensington’s attention was fixed on the woman beside him. Evelyn Carter held a wine glass but hadn’t taken a sip. Her lips curved into a faint, knowing smile.

After years of waiting, she was finally his. Alexander had endured three long years, watching Dominic—a man he deemed unworthy—cling to Evelyn. He would have never allowed their marriage to happen.

But fate had intervened. Evelyn had finally seen Dominic for who he truly was.

The woman who had once been timid, who had shrunk into herself under Dominic’s influence, now sat with quiet confidence. The fire in her eyes hadn’t dimmed. She was still the fierce, untouchable woman he remembered.

"I'm going out," Evelyn said, setting her glass down and meeting Alexander’s gaze.

He nodded. "Remember, I’m here."

She didn’t need his intervention, but his words steadied her. With a grateful glance, she pushed open the VIP room door and stepped into the fray.

The venue was still in chaos, with Dominic leading the charge. He was the loudest voice in the crowd, rallying others to his cause. Beside him, Vanessa Blake struggled to hide her nervousness. She had never stood so close to Dominic before, never been the center of attention like this.

The host frowned until someone whispered in his ear. His expression shifted, and he turned to Dominic. "We intended to handle this discreetly, but given the public demand, the committee has agreed to reveal the names of the two companies—along with their competition entries."

"A plagiarist is a thief who deserves no respect!" Dominic declared passionately, certain he wasn’t the one under scrutiny. If anything, this was his chance to tarnish his competition and elevate DR Holdings’ reputation.

The host adjusted his microphone. "Both companies submitted identical perfumes—both named Eternal Bloom."

Vanessa stiffened. Dominic feigned shock. "Eternal Bloom? That’s DR Holdings’ creation. I’d like to know which company dared to copy our work." Vanessa scanned the crowd as if searching for the culprit.

The host wasted no time. "The other company that submitted the same fragrance is Phoenix Labs."

"Phoenix Labs?" Dominic blinked. "I’ve never heard of them." His tone was humble, but inwardly, he was triumphant. It didn’t matter who they were—as long as he secured his victory.

"Phoenix Labs?" someone in the crowd murmured. "Isn’t that Celestia Group’s subsidiary?"

"Yes, they’re new to the industry, but Celestia backs them."

Dominic scoffed. "Well, my team worked tirelessly for months to perfect Eternal Bloom. I’d love to know how Phoenix Labs got their hands on it."

At that moment, a composed man stepped onto the stage. "Good evening. I’m Preston, PR manager for Phoenix Labs. We, too, were surprised by tonight’s events. Initially, we agreed to resolve this privately, but since the other party insists on public scrutiny, we welcome an on-site verification."

His calm demeanor and Celestia Group’s influence earned nods of approval from the crowd.

Dominic, sensing the shift, quickly interjected, "I agree! DR Holdings may be smaller than Celestia, but we stand by our integrity. We can prove our originality!"

Vanessa chimed in, her voice trembling with conviction. "I created Eternal Bloom myself. I don’t understand how someone else could have copied it."

The audience wavered, unsure whom to believe.

Preston remained unruffled. "We’ve submitted Eternal Bloom’s complete research data to the judges. The committee will make a fair decision."

Dominic scoffed. "We’ve done the same. The truth will come out."

"There’s no need to wait," the host interrupted, holding an envelope. "Mr. Reeves, can you confirm that Ms. Blake solely developed Eternal Bloom?"

"Absolutely!" Dominic declared. "Vanessa is DR Holdings’ top perfumer. She’s responsible for all our bestsellers."

The host turned to Preston. "And who at Phoenix Labs created your version?"

Preston smiled. "As it happens, our perfumer is here tonight. We’d be honored to introduce them."

With a sweeping gesture, he motioned toward the back of the venue.

A figure stepped forward.
###Chapter 6

The figure emerged in a flowing white gown, the spotlight catching every graceful movement as she stepped forward. The simplicity of her attire only accentuated her natural elegance—no jewelry, minimal makeup, yet she commanded the room effortlessly.

"E-Evelyn?!" Dominic's voice cracked with disbelief. His feet moved before his mind could process, closing the distance between them in quick strides. Gripping her wrist, he hissed under his breath, "What the hell are you doing here?"

Evelyn tilted her head, a sly smirk playing on her lips. "Participating in the competition, obviously." She tugged her arm free with deliberate force, stepping past him without hesitation.

"Evelyn!" Dominic's grip tightened, his voice strained. "This isn't the time for games!"

From the VIP booth, Alexander Kensington's gaze sharpened as he watched the exchange, his fingers tightening around his glass.

The next moment, Evelyn wrenched her wrist away, her voice ringing clear across the venue. "Mr. Reeves, if you understand the importance of this event, I suggest you act accordingly." Without another glance, she ascended the stage, leaving Dominic stunned.

Her transformation was jarring. The Evelyn he knew had always been compliant, predictable. Now, she stood before the crowd with an unshakable confidence that unsettled him.

"Good evening, everyone," she began, her voice steady. "I'm Evelyn Carter, lead perfumer at Phoenix Labs, and the creator of Eternal Bloom."

Vanessa Blake's grip on her wine glass turned white-knuckled. She shot Dominic a sharp look, but his attention was fixed on Evelyn, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn continued, unfazed. "The committee informed me of an alleged similarity in our submissions. While I trust the judges' discernment, I welcome any investigation." She stepped back, poised and unshaken, her sincerity undeniable.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Evelyn Carter? Wasn't she that rising star a few years back?"

"Yeah, until that disaster at the Valmont competition. They said she lost her sense of smell."

Vanessa seized the moment, stepping forward with practiced grace. "Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Vanessa Blake of DR Holdings. I've dedicated years to perfumery, and to have my work stolen—" She paused, feigning distress. "Well, I suppose imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."

Evelyn met her gaze, unfazed by the venom beneath Vanessa's smile.

The host intervened, "Both sides present compelling arguments. Is this truly a case of plagiarism?"

The crowd erupted.

"Unheard of! The scent is identical!"

"Disgraceful! The industry can't tolerate this!"

Vanessa took the microphone, triumphant. "I despise plagiarism, but I trust the judges will uphold integrity."

"And you, Ms. Carter?" the host pressed.

Evelyn smiled. "I trust my work."

Before the host could conclude, a foul stench cut through the air—rotten, fishy, clashing violently with the perfumed atmosphere.

"What is that?"

Vanessa froze as the crowd recoiled, their disgusted stares locking onto her.

The realization struck like lightning.

The stench was coming from her.

"Evelyn!" Dominic's voice was raw with betrayal. "Why would you do this?!"
###Chapter 7

The crowd gasped in shock. Almost no one had heard from Evelyn Carter since she vanished from the industry, much less about her connection to Dominic Reeves.

The reporters were practically vibrating with excitement. What they thought would be a routine coverage of tonight's event had suddenly exploded into a scandal involving intellectual property theft and betrayal. Their fingers itched to start typing.

Evelyn remained composed as Dominic approached her with feigned disappointment. "You were part of DR Holdings family. When did you become so ambitious that you'd jump ship without notice?" His voice carried clearly through the microphone. "And take our product with you?"

Murmurs spread through the audience like wildfire.

"So she's the traitor. That explains the plagiarism claims," someone muttered.

"The media hyped her up too much when she won that Best Innovator award. Look at her now," another scoffed.

"This is corporate espionage! Someone call the authorities!"

"Not only has she lost her sense of smell, but her morals too. Pretty face, ugly soul."

The venomous comments kept coming. Dominic struggled to hide his satisfaction. Though confused by the situation, he'd successfully diverted attention from his company's crisis.

Turning to Phoenix Labs' representative with false magnanimity, Dominic declared, "Clearly your company was misled. This is all a misunderstanding. While you're not at fault, everyone knows intellectual property belongs to its original creator. Eternal Bloom is DR Holdings' creation."

"Mr. Reeves," Evelyn's calm voice cut through his speech, "you claim I worked for DR Holdings?" Her serene smile unnerved him inexplicably.

Dominic straightened his tie. "Not anymore, obviously. Today's events are regrettable."

Evelyn chuckled. "Was I ever officially employed by DR Holdings?" Before he could respond, she continued, "Show me the contract. The pay stubs. Any proof of employment."

"Proof? Our entire staff can vouch for you!" Dominic countered.

"So that's a no?" Evelyn's simple question silenced him.

He'd exploited her loyalty, avoiding formal contracts to maintain control. Her sporadic income came through his discretionary payments for her apartment and expenses - a calculated move that now backfired spectacularly.

"Regardless, we're not obligated to provide documentation here," Vanessa Blake interjected haughtily from the audience. "This isn't your stage. As your former friend, I suggest you leave quietly."

Vanessa's words sparked an idea. Dominic grabbed Evelyn's wrist, hissing through clenched teeth, "We'll discuss this privately later." His grip tightened in silent warning.

Evelyn effortlessly freed herself. "Mr. Reeves, why wouldn't you defend your rights when the committee has identified you and Ms. Blake as victims of plagiarism? I trust the judges will be fair."

She turned to the host. "We've submitted Eternal Bloom's complete research data and samples. We have faith in the committee's impartiality."

"Wait!" Dominic raised his hand. "Since Ms. Carter had access to our research, identical submissions prove nothing! How can the committee determine the truth?"

Sweat beaded on his forehead. The identical data was problematic - after all, Evelyn had created the original formula.

With his options narrowing, Dominic pivoted to damage control. If he couldn't stop Evelyn, he'd paint her as the villain to salvage DR Holdings' reputation.

The host received a message and straightened. "Mr. Reeves, rest assured - while the submissions are similar, the judges found critical differences."

Dominic paled. Vanessa began fidgeting, catching whiffs of an odd scent that made nearby attendees subtly edge away.

"The judges declare Phoenix Labs' Eternal Bloom the winner!" the host announced.

Dominic's face contorted. "Impossible! We developed Eternal Bloom over years! The resources we invested—this is corporate favoritism! Celestia Group's influence can't justify crushing smaller companies like ours!"

His impassioned plea resonated with many independent perfumers in attendance.

"This is outrageous! If the formulas are identical, why did Phoenix win?" someone shouted.

"Daylight robbery! Call the police!"

Evelyn watched Dominic's performance with amusement. "Since you insist on evidence..." She accepted two small vials from a Phoenix Labs associate.
###Chapter 8

"These two bottles contain samples from Phoenix Labs and DR Holdings, respectively. Mr. Reeves, would you kindly test them and determine if there's any distinction?" Evelyn Carter lifted the vials high, ensuring every attendee could see them clearly.

Dominic Reeves narrowed his eyes skeptically. "What difference does it make? The judges already declared the scents and ingredients nearly identical. What purpose does this spectacle serve?"

"It serves to prove why Phoenix Labs won the competition." Evelyn's voice remained soft, yet firm. "You accused me of stealing DR Holdings' formula, didn't you? If you insist this is plagiarism, and there is a difference between the samples, then logically, the original should be superior. Am I correct?" She tilted her head slightly. "Since you claim injustice, this is your opportunity to expose the truth—to our industry peers and the press."

Evelyn's composure was unshaken, her smile unwavering. Many in the room had formed prejudices against her due to past rumors, yet her serene demeanor made it difficult for them to voice their usual harsh judgments.

Dominic studied her, his frown deepening. What game is she playing? Why is she provoking this confrontation? And since when does she ignore my authority?

"Ah, but of course," Evelyn continued smoothly, "you aren't a perfumer by trade. Technical nuances might elude you. However, Ms. Blake—" She turned toward Vanessa Blake, who stood rigidly behind Dominic. "—as the creator of Eternal Bloom, surely you can identify the discrepancies?"

Vanessa's grip on her wine glass tightened. Panic clawed at her throat. She knew exactly how Evelyn had crafted Eternal Bloom.

Why was Evelyn suddenly here? Why force her to compare the samples? Vanessa couldn't decipher Evelyn's motives, and that terrified her.

She forced a graceful smile. "This incident is regrettable for both companies. Yes, Eternal Bloom's formula was compromised, but what does it matter now which sample is authentic? Evelyn, we were friends once. I won’t escalate this further." She lifted the hem of her gown, preparing to exit.

"But I intend to escalate it," Evelyn countered, her voice laced with amusement. "What then?"

Vanessa froze, whirling back with wide eyes.

"Evelyn, this is outrageous!" Dominic hissed, angling his face away from the cameras.

"Outrageous?" Evelyn smirked. She uncorked both vials and set them on the table.

"Ladies and gentlemen," she announced, "I created Eternal Bloom to capture the bittersweet essence of first love—nostalgia, longing, the ache of what could have been. Its base is sweet, yet with a faint astringency that lingers into warmth. The difference between these samples lies in their base notes."

Curious attendees leaned in, sniffing the test strips. Confusion rippled through the crowd.

"They smell identical. What’s the distinction?"

Perfume unfolds in stages—top notes, heart, then base. The crowd lacked patience to wait.

Evelyn smiled. "You’ve already smelled the difference."

A murmur. Then realization struck.

"It was on her! That foul odor earlier!"

Vanessa blanched. She tampered with my sample!

Evelyn met her glare with icy amusement. Indeed, she’d instructed Isabella Thornton to add a special ingredient to Vanessa’s vial—one that, when the base notes emerged, reeked of rotting fish.

Vanessa had doused herself in Eternal Bloom to stand out. The timing was impeccable.

"The base notes are completely different!"

"If it’s plagiarism, why alter the formula into something foul?"

Dominic stepped forward, his voice commanding. "Even if there were an error, it wouldn’t be this catastrophic. Ms. Blake dedicated months to perfecting Eternal Bloom. Consider this—if we stole the formula, why sabotage our own product? Clearly, someone stole it and contaminated our sample to frame DR Holdings."

His gaze slashed toward Evelyn.

"Ms. Carter, we showed leniency because of your past employment here. But you’ve crossed a line—accusing us of your crimes. I’ll sue for defamation to protect our reputations. And if Phoenix Labs shields a thief, they’ll face litigation too."

The crowd erupted.

"Disgraceful!"

"The judges should be investigated!"

"Kick her out!"

In the VIP booth, Alexander Kensington’s knuckles whitened around his glass. Rarely had he encountered such brazen deceit.

His wife stood alone onstage—small, yet unbroken. He moved to intervene—

Then Evelyn spoke.

"You’re right. I did alter the formula."

Alexander stilled.

Evelyn lifted her chin, radiant under the lights. Not a flicker of fear. Only certainty.

He exhaled. Trust her.
###Chapter 9

To everyone's shock, including Dominic Reeves, Vanessa Blake stepped forward and confessed.

"Since Mr. Reeves insists that Ms. Blake was the creator of Eternal Bloom, she should know every detail of it," Evelyn Carter said coolly. "So, Ms. Blake, why don’t you tell me the difference between these two samples? What exactly did I alter in the formula? Which note did I change?"

Vanessa paled. She hadn’t set foot in a lab in two years. Even if she remembered the basics, each perfume had its own unique formula, measurements, and raw materials.

While Evelyn had been buried in her work perfecting Eternal Bloom, Vanessa had been busy clinging to Dominic’s arm. Why bother with tedious formulas when she could secure fame and fortune just by being his chosen one?

Her fingers tightened around the hem of Dominic’s sleeve, her lips pressed into a thin line.

Dominic noticed her distress and instinctively moved to shield her. "You’re the one who tampered with the formula. How would Vanessa know what you changed? You’ve already admitted to sabotaging DR Holdings’ perfume. This farce should end now—"

"I admitted to altering my own formula, not stealing it," Evelyn cut in sharply. "The formula belongs to me. I can modify it as I please. But if Vanessa truly created Eternal Bloom, shouldn’t she recognize every detail? Or is this a case of the thief accusing the victim?"

The accusation landed like a slap. Vanessa, caught off guard, could only stammer, "Y-You’re lying! You—"

Before she could finish, she swayed dramatically and collapsed.

"Vanessa!" Dominic lunged forward, catching her before she hit the ground. He shot a glare at the host. "Due to Ms. Blake’s condition, DR Holdings must withdraw from the event."

Then, his icy gaze locked onto Evelyn. "But this isn’t over."

Evelyn watched, unimpressed, as he carried Vanessa away.

How predictable. When cornered, play the fainting damsel.

The scandal forced the committee to withhold Eternal Bloom’s award, though the rest of the ceremony continued.

As Evelyn left the venue, reporters swarmed her.

"Ms. Carter, did you plan today’s confrontation?"

"After disappearing from the industry two years ago, was this your revenge for being framed?"

"Rumors say you and Dominic Reeves were involved. Is this personal?"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "You’ll get your answers soon enough."

With that, she slipped into the waiting limousine, shutting out the flashing cameras.

The moment the door closed, the noise vanished. The cool air inside made her shiver—until a warm jacket draped over her shoulders.

"You’re still here?" She turned, surprised to see Alexander Kensington.

"Would I miss such an entertaining performance?" He leaned back, sighing. "Though the ending was… unsatisfying."

Evelyn smirked. "This isn’t the end. Just the beginning."

Alexander arched a brow. "Oh?"

"I won’t let thieves keep what’s mine."

Her phone buzzed. Isabella "Bella" Thornton’s name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn answered, only to be met with wild laughter.

"That was brilliant! I’ve never seen Vanessa so humiliated!" Bella cackled. "When you told me to tweak their sample, I didn’t expect this! She looked like she’d swallowed a lemon on live broadcast!"

Evelyn glanced at Alexander, who was pretending not to listen. "Bella, tone it down."

"Tone it down? Never! But wait—you’re leaving DR Holdings, right? You’re with Phoenix Labs now? When did that happen? Are they treating you well?"

Evelyn’s cheeks warmed. "We’ll talk later. Dominic will come after you. Deny everything and blame me, understand?"

Bella scoffed. "Please. I’ve dealt with worse. But you—he’s going to be furious. Stay at my place tonight. I’ll protect you."

Before Evelyn could reply, Alexander’s sharp gaze pinned her in place.

"N-No need," she stammered. "I’ve got it covered. Talk tomorrow." She hung up quickly.

Right.

Her wedding night.

She’d almost forgotten.
###Chapter 10

Evelyn glanced at Alexander Kensington discreetly, only to find his dark gaze already fixed upon her. She didn't know how long he'd been watching. Caught red-handed, heat rushed to her cheeks.

"Any other plans tonight?" Alexander murmured, his proximity sending flutters through Evelyn's stomach.

The stubborn streak in her bones refused to let her retreat. Meeting his obsidian eyes, she forced her voice steady. "If you recall, Mr. Kensington, tonight happens to be our wedding night. What other arrangements could I possibly have?"

Evelyn pretended nonchalance, but her fingers dug into her knees, betraying her nerves.

Alexander's lips twitched. "Excellent." When he straightened, Evelyn exhaled - though relief remained elusive.

The car halted unexpectedly at a luxury spa's entrance rather than his private residence. Golden signage glowed warmly against the night.

Noticing her confusion, Alexander anticipated her question. "Today's events left little time for proper preparations."

"That's quite alright," Evelyn murmured. Their marriage was transactional after all - no need for pomp. Yet when she saw the rose-petaled restaurant interior, genuine emotion tightened her throat.

The expansive dining room held only two seats. Staff maintained discreet distance, clearly instructed to preserve privacy. Alexander had reserved the entire establishment - impressive even for his influence, given the short notice.

"Relax," he said, slicing into his steak with effortless grace. "The press won't disturb us here."

"Th-thank you, Alex." Normally articulate, Evelyn found herself tongue-tied.

Alexander stilled, raising an eyebrow. "For?"

"For honoring our agreement. And... all this." However impulsive their union, Evelyn felt no regret.

A rare chuckle escaped Alexander as he transferred perfectly cut steak to her plate. "You may have more to thank me for later."

The suite's private hot tub steamed invitingly when they arrived. Evelyn's pulse quickened at the implication. Flushed, she busied herself with a water ss in the kitchenette.

Noticing her tension, Alexander retrieved wine sses instead. "Join me?"

Initially refusing, Evelyn reconsidered - perhaps liquid courage would help. She'd exhausted her boldness proposing this arrangement.

Their sses clinked. Evelyn gulped hers recklessly, coughing when the alcohol burned her throat.

Alexander laughed softly, patting her back. "I'll soak first. Take your time." His retreat gave her space to reconsider.

Instead, Evelyn downed another ss. Then another. Half the bottle later, warmth spread through her limbs. Through the haze, she saw Alexander's silhouette in the tub - broad shoulders glistening, muscles defined by water droplets.

Dry-mouthed, she approached. Alexander didn't turn, granting her this choice.

Decision made, Evelyn shed her outer layers. The hot water prickled her skin as she slid in beside him. Suddenly sober, she crossed her arms self-consciously. Nathaniel had never seen her like this - their relationship hadn't progressed beyond chaste kisses.

Their proximity made the water seem cooler by comparison. Alexander cupped her chin, forcing eye contact. "Last chance to back out."

Evelyn answered by crashing her lips against his, the metallic tang of blood blooming where teeth met flesh. Actions spoke louder than words.

In this world of calculated exchanges, she'd pay whatever price necessary.

Alexander needed no further invitation. What began in the tub continued as he carried her to bed, Evelyn's damp hair fanning across the sheets like spilled ink. Her lashes fluttered against flushed cheeks - a vision of surrender.
###Chapter 11

Evelyn's fingers curled into the sheets beneath her, her knuckles turning white with tension. She had read about moments like this in books and seen them in movies, but reality was entirely different.

Dominic noticed her unease immediately. His gaze softened as he took in her tightly shut eyes. "If you're not ready," he murmured, his voice low and steady, "we can stop."

A shiver ran down Evelyn's spine. When she opened her eyes, she found nothing but sincerity in his expression. The way he looked at her—like she was something precious—made warmth bloom in her chest. Swallowing hard, she released his hand and instead wrapped her arms around his neck.

"I can do this," she whispered, though her voice trembled. "P-Please… don't stop."

Then it happened.

A familiar sensation jolted through her, and realization struck like lightning. No. It couldn’t be. Not now.

Mortified, Evelyn curled in on herself, grabbing a pillow and pressing it over her face. She wanted to disappear.

Dominic stilled. The heat in his eyes dimmed as he exhaled, a quiet chuckle escaping him. After a beat of silence, he reached for her again, lifting her effortlessly.

"W-What are you—?"

Before she could protest, the pillow slipped from her grasp. She stared up at him, wide-eyed, like a startled deer caught in headlights.

"Relax," he said, his tone calm but firm. "I won’t do anything you don’t want."

He carried her into the shower, setting her down gently before adjusting the water temperature. Handing her the showerhead, he stepped back. "Take your time. I’ll wait outside."

The door clicked shut behind him.

Evelyn stood under the warm spray, her mind reeling. The water soothed her nerves, but her thoughts were a tangled mess. Dominic—ruthless in business, feared by competitors—had just been… considerate. Gentle.

It didn’t make sense.

Then, another problem struck.

She didn’t have any sanitary products.

Her cheeks burned. She’d been so absorbed in launching Eternal Bloom that she’d completely forgotten her cycle. And now, of all times—

Do hotels even stock these? Should I call for a delivery? But my phone’s outside… and if Dominic sees—

The door opened again.

Evelyn froze as Dominic reappeared, placing a small bag in the dry area. "Here," he said simply before leaving once more.

Heart pounding, she peeked inside.

Fresh pajamas. New underwear. And—her stomach flipped—sanitary pads. High-end ones, too.

He’d thought of everything.

She dressed quickly, her embarrassment fading into something softer. When she stepped out, Dominic was seated in a chair beside the bed, already in silk pajamas, his laptop open. The rich aroma of coffee filled the room.

He glanced up as she approached.

"Come here," he said.

His voice was quiet, but the command in it sent a shiver down her spine.
###Chapter 12

Evelyn approached Dominic cautiously, but he turned toward a small table instead. With a slight tilt of his chin, he gestured toward the steaming mug.

"Drink that and get some rest," he said, his voice low but firm.

Evelyn glanced at the drink—hot chocolate, rich and fragrant. She was surprised by his thoughtfulness. In such a short time, he had prepared everything she might need. She pressed her lips together and took a sip, the warmth spreading through her, soothing the dull ache in her abdomen.

The soft glow of the bedside lamp cast shadows across the room as Dominic dimmed the lights. He studied her for a moment before asking, "Something wrong?"

A yawn escaped her before she could stop it. "Aren't you coming to bed?" she murmured, her eyelids growing heavy.

"Later," he replied, adjusting her pillow with careful precision. He tucked the blanket around her before sitting back in the armchair, lifting his coffee cup to his lips.

Evelyn watched him through half-lidded eyes. The golden light played across his sharp features, softening the edges of his silhouette. From this angle, he looked almost ethereal—his jawline strong, his expression unreadable. How had she never noticed how striking he was?

Then she noticed the dark liquid in his cup. "You—you shouldn’t drink coffee this late," she mumbled, her words slurring slightly.

Dominic arched a brow, setting the cup down. "What should I drink instead?"

Silence.

Evelyn had already curled into the pillows, her breathing steady and slow. She was out before he could finish his question.

A faint smile tugged at Dominic’s lips as he watched her. He closed his laptop, set it aside, and dimmed the lights further before moving to the other side of the bed. He slipped beneath the covers, careful not to disturb her.

When he wrapped an arm around her waist, she stirred slightly, turning toward him in her sleep. Her fingers curled against his chest, and he exhaled, adjusting his hold.

Their wedding night passed without the usual expectations—just warmth, quiet, and the steady rhythm of shared breath.

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Evelyn woke, her body surprisingly free of discomfort. She hadn’t slept this well in months.

She stretched—or tried to—before realizing an arm was draped over her waist. Her head was pillowed against someone’s shoulder.

Memory rushed back in a dizzying wave.

Right. Married.

"You're awake?" Dominic’s voice was rough with sleep, sending a shiver down her spine.

Evelyn nodded. "Good morning."

"Hungry?" he asked, his fingers tracing idle patterns along her arm.

"N-not really," she admitted, suddenly hyper-aware of his proximity. She wasn’t used to sharing a bed, let alone waking up to someone else’s warmth.

"Good," he murmured, shifting closer. His breath ghosted over her ear, sending heat pooling low in her stomach. "Because I am."

His meaning was unmistakable.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked.

"Go call for breakfast," he said, his lips brushing her earlobe. "The phone’s in the living room."

She bolted upright, scrambling out of bed before he could say another word.

Dominic chuckled as she fled, then winced, flexing his numb arm.
###Chapter 13

The breakfast spread at The Chateau Royale was exquisite, offering everything from freshly baked croissants to tropical fruit platters. Evelyn and Alexander savored their meal as golden sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a warm glow over the linen-covered table.

Alexander meticulously spread raspberry jam on his toast before speaking. "I'm heading to Celestia Group headquarters this morning. Since Phoenix Labs is on the way, I can drop you off." His deep voice carried that effortless charm that always made Evelyn's pulse quicken.

Evelyn took a sip of her orange juice, shaking her head. "No need. I'm not going to Phoenix until this afternoon." She hesitated, then added, "Besides, we agreed to keep our...arrangement private."

Her words trailed off as Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto hers. He slid the perfectly prepared toast across the table. "Relax. I keep my promises. Only Phoenix's executive team knows Celestia recruited you. Harrison handled the negotiations, so they're unaware that—"

A slow, knowing smile curved his lips as his eyes traveled over her. "You're my wife." The simple declaration hung in the air, weighted with unspoken meaning.

Evelyn nearly choked on her juice. The way this man could turn an ordinary statement into something scandalous with just his tone was criminal. For someone who projected such icy restraint, Alexander Kensington had a dangerous talent for making her blush with a single sentence.

"Right. Well." Evelyn focused intently on arranging her silverware, suddenly fascinated by the pattern on her plate. "I should make some calls." She devoured the toast in three quick bites before excusing herself.

Stepping into the suite's sitting room, Evelyn pulled out her phone to finalize her departure from DR Holdings. The screen lit up with twenty-three missed calls—all from Dominic Reeves. A smirk tugged at her lips.

She'd silenced her phone yesterday after leaving the competition, wanting space from the drama. She'd expected Dominic to reach out, but not with this level of desperation. In their entire relationship, he'd never initiated this much contact unless it involved work.

As her thumb hovered over the screen, another call flashed—Dominic again.

Evelyn glanced back at the dining area where Alexander sat, his aristocratic profile illuminated by morning light. He moved with the effortless grace of royalty, every gesture precise and controlled. The contrast between the two men couldn't be more striking.

Taking a deep breath, she answered. "Dominic?"

"Evelyn, where the hell are you?" His voice sounded ragged, like he'd been up all night. "What do you want, Mr. Reeves?" She kept her tone deliberately neutral.

"Don't play games. Running away won't solve anything." His accusation made her laugh. "Run away? From what exactly? The humiliation you brought upon yourself?"

The line crackled with his frustrated exhale. Evelyn watched Alexander rise from the table, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders as he moved toward the window. She had nothing to hide—not from him, not anymore. Last night's events had burned every bridge with Dominic, and she wouldn't pretend otherwise.
###Chapter 14

"If you weren't running away, why didn't you come home last night? Do you have any idea how long I stayed up waiting for you?" Dominic paused, his voice strained. "There must be some misunderstanding about yesterday. I don’t blame you. Just come home, and we’ll sort this out, okay?"

Evelyn let out a quiet laugh, considering his words. "Fine. I’ll meet you at the office later." She ended the call and returned to the dining table, where Alexander finally glanced up at her. "Leaving already?"

"Not yet." She settled back into her seat, her mood noticeably lighter. She took her time with her meal, savoring each bite. "I’m not the one in a hurry here."

How many times had she waited for Dominic, watching the clock tick by? Now, it was his turn to wait.

"He won’t let yesterday slide easily." Dominic was petty, the kind of man who held grudges over the smallest slights. The humiliation he’d suffered? That would fester. And her departure? A death blow to DR Holdings. "Neither will I," Evelyn murmured, meeting Alexander’s gaze with a knowing smile.

Alexander simply smiled back.

Dominic waited all day, skipping lunch, his patience thinning by the minute. By 3 PM, Evelyn still hadn’t shown. He called again—no answer. Frustration boiled over, and he nearly hurled his phone across the room.

"Nate, I told you we couldn’t trust Evelyn! You were too naive to see it." Vanessa lounged on the plush leather sofa, meticulously slicing an apple. "Last night was a setup. Didn’t I say she was acting strange? But no, you insisted she was fine. And now—"

"Shut up!" Dominic snapped, his temper frayed. He considered calling Evelyn again but knew it was pointless. Instead, he turned his anger on Vanessa, who flinched at his tone. Her lips pursed, her gaze dropping to her lap.

"Why are you yelling at me? I didn’t betray you or the company! I’ve been the one by your side, taking care of you! I’m the only one who truly cares!" She thrust the plate of sliced apples toward him, her eyes glistening. "Eat something. No matter how angry you are, you shouldn’t starve yourself. I—I can’t bear the thought of you hurting."

Her voice trembled, tears threatening to spill. Even in distress, she was stunning. Dominic’s irritation softened instantly. With a sigh, he took the plate from her.

He pulled her close, his arm around her shoulders. "I’m not mad at you. I’m just… frustrated. Forgive me, okay? I know you only want what’s best for me." He brushed a tear from her cheek. "Don’t cry, darling."

"You’re just saying that," Vanessa sniffled, squirming slightly in his embrace. "But you’re still thinking about her." Her words, her vulnerability—it all played right into his soft spot.

"Mr. Reeves, I—" The door creaked open, and Evelyn peeked inside. Her lips curled at the sight of them tangled together. "Oh. Bad timing. I’ll just—"

"Evelyn!" Dominic jerked away from Vanessa as if burned.

He lunged forward, closing the distance before she could leave. "Get back here!" After waiting all day, he wasn’t about to let her walk away. "Where the hell were you? Why didn’t you answer my calls? Do you know how worried I was? What were you doing?" He seized her wrist, dragging her into his office and slamming the door shut.

Evelyn blinked, taken aback. Dominic looked genuinely distressed, his voice laced with concern. As if he actually cared. But what had he been doing moments before she walked in?

Her gaze flicked to Vanessa, who stood stiffly across the room. The woman’s expression darkened before she forced a sweet smile.

"Nate’s right, Evelyn. We were so worried when you didn’t come home. Where were you? With those people from Phoenix Labs?" Vanessa’s voice dripped with false concern. "You shouldn’t trust them. Who knows what lies they’ve fed you?"
###Chapter 15

"What ridiculous lies could they have possibly fed you?" Evelyn jerked her arm free from Dominic's grasp and stepped closer to Vanessa. "I'm dying to hear what you imagine they told me."

Under Evelyn's piercing stare, Vanessa looked away. "How would I know their exact words? But I'm guessing they tried to poach you despite knowing you're with us. They probably trash-talked DR Holdings while praising themselves. Evelyn—" She paused, feigning sudden realization.

"Did they offer you more money?"

"More money?" Evelyn blinked, her expression deliberately blank. "What exactly would qualify as 'more' to you?"

Vanessa barely concealed her disgust. This idiot doesn't even understand salary negotiations. How did she get involved with Phoenix Labs? Someone must've orchestrated last night—probably manipulated her.

"Evelyn, I'm just concerned." Vanessa forced concern into her voice, seizing Evelyn's arm.

Vanessa stood taller, forcing Evelyn's arm upward uncomfortably rather than adjusting her posture.

Evelyn tilted her head up, studying her so-called best friend of years. How did I not see through this act before?

Perfume research had consumed Evelyn, leaving little room for socializing. She'd believed a few genuine friendships were enough—only to realize some saw her sincerity as stupidity.

Evelyn tightened her grip, yanking Vanessa down to eye level. "Is this how I'm speaking now? Funny, I don't recall changing. Oh wait—are you upset because I claimed Eternal Bloom as mine?" Her tone dripped faux innocence. "But it is my creation. You said we might lose the competition, remember? I didn’t want you taking blame for my work. Yet yesterday, you accused me of stealing your formula. Interesting shift, don’t you think?"

Vanessa winced at the pressure on her arm. Flustered, she shot Dominic a pleading look.

"Evelyn, we all said things we didn’t mean in the heat of the moment," Dominic interjected smoothly. "You pushed us to that point too. Let’s move past this." He rested a hand on Evelyn’s shoulder. "Vanessa and I searched everywhere for you last night. You never came home. Can’t we talk this out? I worry someone’s exploiting your naivety."

"You searched all night?" Evelyn laughed, twisting Vanessa’s arm sharply as she turned. Vanessa gasped. "E-Evelyn—my arm—"

"Oops." Evelyn released her with exaggerated apology. "Didn’t realize your arm was trespassing in my space."

Vanessa’s frown deepened at the barb.

Ignoring her, Evelyn locked eyes with Dominic. "Funny—Ms. Blake collapsed yesterday, didn’t she? Remarkable recovery speed for someone who supposedly scoured the city all night. I’m touched."

Vanessa’s nails dug into her palms. "Evelyn, we’re friends! You and Dominic have years of history. Don’t let outsiders poison that." Her smile strained. "But last night’s stunt hurt DR Holdings—and him. What did Phoenix Labs really promise you?"

Dominic’s gaze sharpened. Yes—what had changed Evelyn so drastically?
###Chapter 16

They couldn't comprehend Evelyn's sudden transformation.

Evelyn had always been the epitome of obedience—quiet, compliant, the perfect pawn. But the woman who stood on that stage, speaking with unshakable confidence, was someone entirely different.

Overnight, she had become unrecognizable.

And she had nearly destroyed DR Holdings in the process.

Dominic's jaw clenched. If she weren't still useful, I would have ended this farce right here. Does she know about Vanessa and me? Is that why she’s changed?

But that made no sense. If Evelyn had discovered their affair, she would have screamed, cried, made a scene. Instead, she was eerily calm.

Too calm.

Vanessa and Dominic seethed in silence, their expressions carefully controlled.

Evelyn found it hilarious.

She had planned to walk away—no contracts bound her to DR Holdings, after all. But then they had the audacity to keep up their charade, pretending nothing had happened.

Did they really think she was that stupid?

Let’s see how long they can keep this up.

Evelyn lowered her head, dragging out her words for effect. "They said..." She hesitated, pacing slowly, as if wrestling with some impossible decision.

Behind her, Dominic and Vanessa exchanged glances. Someone must be manipulating her.

Dominic stepped forward. "What did they say?"

Evelyn sighed, shaking her head. "Well..."

She was enjoying this.

How does it feel to be the one played for once?

Vanessa's patience snapped. Yesterday's disaster still burned in her mind. She should have been basking in the spotlight, accepting her award with grace. Instead, the headlines mocked her—photos of her fainting, accusations of plagiarism.

All because of Evelyn.

But she couldn’t act on her rage. Not yet.

Vanessa forced a concerned expression. "Evelyn, just tell us! Who said what? If they're spreading lies to sabotage us, we need to know!"

Evelyn stopped.

Then she looked up, her hesitation gone.

A slow, knowing smile curved her lips.

"They said..."
###Chapter 17

"They claimed you're having an affair and that you both conspired to manipulate me!"

Dominic's expression darkened instantly. "What ridiculous lies are you spouting?"

Vanessa, however, froze at Evelyn's accusation. Confronted so bluntly, guilt flickered across her face, and she averted her gaze instinctively.

Hearing Dominic's sharp tone snapped her back to reality. "Honestly, Evelyn, how could you believe such nonsense? It's absurd!"

"Evelyn, the three of us have been friends for years. Do you really need outsiders to define our relationship? How could you fall for such petty rumors? It’s hurtful." Vanessa’s voice trembled, her eyes welling up with tears as if she were the one wronged.

Evelyn nearly scoffed at the performance. If life were a stage, Vanessa would have won an Oscar by now.

She lowered her lashes, feigning confusion. "It wasn’t just one person saying it. Multiple people mentioned you and Dom—"

"Evelyn!" Dominic cut her off sharply, gripping her arm. "Are you seriously this naive? Why would you trust strangers over us? Think for once—who has stood by you all these years?"

His tone was laced with fury, as if her doubt alone was an unforgivable betrayal. And yet, the irony wasn’t lost on Evelyn. If she had truly used her brain sooner, she wouldn’t have been fooled for so long.

Watching Dominic’s anger and Vanessa’s crocodile tears only amused her further. She had expected them to crumble under pressure, but they clung to their act like seasoned actors.

Fine. If they wanted to keep pretending, she’d play along.

"Since things have escalated, why don’t we just announce that Vanessa and I co-developed Eternal Bloom?"

"No!" Vanessa snapped instantly. "After last night’s disaster, no one would believe it! It won’t salvage DR Holdings’ reputation—it’ll only make things worse!"

Dominic hesitated at first, but Vanessa’s firm rejection spurred him into agreement. "Exactly. Besides, your track record in the industry is already questionable. If we admit you worked together, it’ll look like we’re covering up last night’s mess. I won’t allow that."

"Then what’s your solution?" Evelyn already knew they’d refuse. She was curious how they planned to clean up their own mess.

"Evelyn." Dominic grasped her shoulders, his voice dropping to a low, urgent whisper. "There’s only one way. You have to do it."

"What do you mean?" She arched a brow, feigning ignorance.

"We’ll call a press conference. You’ll admit you got carried away and tried to take full credit. Then, you’ll apologize to Vanessa. DR Holdings will publicly forgive you, and we’ll spin this into a redemption story." He spoke smoothly, as if he’d rehearsed the script a hundred times.

Evelyn bit her lip, pretending to consider it. "But what about Phoenix Labs?"

"Just reject them. Did you sign anything with them yet?" His frown deepened at the mention of the rival company, irritation flashing in his eyes.
###Chapter 18

Dominic felt completely in the dark about what had transpired between Evelyn and Phoenix Labs.

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "I didn't."

"That's excellent news. Since you haven't signed any contracts with Celestia Group, we can still rectify this situation."

"They're simply manipulating you. I'm being generous by not suing Phoenix for slandering us."

With visible relief, Dominic gave Evelyn's arm a reassuring pat. "Evelyn, you're too innocent to comprehend the cutthroat nature of corporate warfare. We're only trying to protect you from these ugly realities."

"Let Vanessa and I handle this mess. You should focus on what you do best - creating exquisite perfumes. Isn't that your true passion? Wouldn't you rather spend your time developing new fragrances?"

Evelyn studied him carefully. He'd been gaslighting her for years, conditioning her to serve DR Holdings selflessly. Even now, they wanted her to take the fall while pretending it was for her benefit. If she confessed to stealing formulas now, her reputation would be ruined beyond repair.

Dominic's plan was transparent - protect DR Holdings and Vanessa's image while destroying Evelyn's credibility. Once branded a thief, she'd have no choice but to obey his every command. The sheer calculation of it made her stomach turn.

"Will DR Holdings recover if I admit my mistakes? You won't... abandon me, will you?" Evelyn asked with feigned vulnerability.

Dominic's expression softened. This was the compliant Evelyn he knew. She'd always prioritized his feelings above all else - how could she possibly betray him?

"Don't fret. I know someone's been influencing you. You're not to blame - we need to expose those malicious actors," Dominic said soothingly, pulling her into an embrace. "Everything will be fine. Vanessa and I will stand by you during the press conference. You're not alone in this."

Evelyn nodded, suppressing her revulsion. "I'll trust your judgment." Vanessa watched them through narrowed eyes, jealousy simmering beneath her composed facade. For now, she had to play along.

The moment Evelyn exited, Vanessa exploded. "Are you completely bewitched by her? How can you take her at face value? Do you honestly believe Phoenix Labs revealed our affair? Why would they tell her?"

"Whether Phoenix leaked our relationship is irrelevant now," Dominic said coolly, lighting a cigarette. "Damage control is our priority."

Vanessa scoffed. "You think she'll follow your script? Remember how she dominated last night's event. What if she turns the tables during the press conference?" Despite considering Evelyn foolish, Vanessa's instincts screamed something was amiss.

"She wouldn't dare!" Dominic exhaled a smoke ring. "And even if she tries, I have contingencies. Honestly, she's not that clever. Yesterday was likely just a misunderstanding."
###Chapter 19

Evelyn Carter drove straight to Phoenix Labs after leaving DR Holdings. The research facility was located miles away from corporate headquarters. Evelyn and Isabella "Bella" Thornton focused solely on R&D, ensuring products underwent rigorous testing before mass production.

Dominic Reeves, however, operated differently. He demanded immediate results, pushing untested formulas into production. "The market waits for no one," he'd argue. "If we delay, competitors will steal our ideas." His obsession with speed over safety constantly clashed with Evelyn's scientific approach.

As lead researcher, Evelyn could only voice objections. Dominic would dismiss her concerns with a condescending smile. "Leave the business decisions to me, darling. Just focus on creating pretty perfumes." His patronizing tone made her blood boil.

The traffic light turned red. Evelyn slammed the brakes, her knuckles whitening on the steering wheel. She needed to stop thinking about Dominic. Their relationship was over. She had sacrificed everything for that man - her career, her reputation, even her family's approval. And for what?

When Evelyn arrived at Phoenix Labs, she immediately sensed trouble. The usually bustling facility felt eerily quiet. Bella wasn't at her workstation. Instead, Evelyn found her assistant cornered in the archives room by three unfamiliar men in suits.

"E-Evelyn!" Bella's face lit up with relief. "Thank God you're here! They're trying to confiscate our research!"

Evelyn sized up the intruders. Their expensive suits couldn't hide their thuggish demeanor. "Who authorized this?" she demanded.

"Mr. Reeves' orders," the tallest one sneered. "We're your new lab partners. Starting today."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. So this was Dominic's move - sending goons to monitor her work. Did he really think she'd continue business as usual after yesterday's betrayal?

"If you're here to assist," Evelyn said icily, "why aren't you in the lab? What's your interest in confidential files?"

Bella trembled beside her. "They demanded all R&D documents and the archive keys!"

Evelyn stepped between her assistant and the men. "Our research is proprietary. You have no clearance."

"Mr. Reeves said—"

"Enough!" Evelyn cut him off. "If Dominic has demands, he can tell me himself. For all I know, you could be corporate spies." The men exchanged uneasy glances. "Now get out before I call security."

The lead thug's smirk faltered. "This isn't over, Ms. Carter. Mr. Reeves won't tolerate disobedience."

Evelyn held the door open. "Tell Dominic he'll have my resignation by noon if this harassment continues."

As the men slunk away, Bella collapsed into a chair. "What do we do now?"

Evelyn's fingers hovered over her phone. Every instinct screamed to call Dominic and unleash her fury. But revenge would come on her terms. She scrolled past his contact and dialed a different number - one she hadn't used in years.

"Julian? It's Evelyn. I need your help."
###Chapter 20

One of the men finally stepped forward, his voice firm. "Evelyn, we're just following orders. If you have any complaints, take it up with Mr. Reeves. We're only doing what he instructed."

"Fine. You think I'm afraid of him?" Evelyn narrowed her eyes, pulling out her phone to call Dominic. The line rang, but no one answered—even though she knew he was available.

He was giving her a taste of her own medicine.

Dominic thought this would break her, force her to admit her mistakes. The man in front of her smirked, as if he’d expected the call to go unanswered. "Evelyn, your assistant has been stalling for over an hour. There’s no point wasting time when Mr. Reeves has plenty of it. Sure, the files are confidential, but they belong to DR Holdings. He just wants you to hand them over. Don’t worry—we’ll take good care of them."

Evelyn hung up, her lips curling into a cold smile. "How thoughtful of Dom." Then she turned to Sophia, her expression unreadable.

Sophia, who had been ready to fight tooth and nail to protect those documents, was taken aback by Evelyn’s reaction.

"Evelyn, you worked tirelessly on those formulas. They’re invaluable! If they’re suddenly demanding them, they must have an ulterior motive!"

Evelyn knew Dominic was watching. He wanted to strip her of her work, leaving her defenseless. If she resisted, he’d twist it into proof that Vanessa had been the real mastermind behind their past successes.

Without hesitation, Evelyn said, "Give it to them, Soph. He’s right—no matter how confidential, they belong to DR Holdings. If Mr. Reeves wants them, we’ll comply."

Sophia hesitated, but Evelyn’s tone left no room for argument. Reluctantly, she handed over the files, though her confusion was evident. She searched Evelyn’s face for answers but found only steely resolve.

The documents were thick, stacked high. The men loaded them into the waiting car before turning back. "The key to the archives room, too."

Sophia’s temper flared. "You’ve already taken everything! What do you need an empty room for?"

"Mr. Reeves’ orders."

Evelyn tilted her chin slightly. "Give it to them, Soph."

Dominic thought he had her cornered, that without those files, she’d be powerless. But the most crucial details weren’t on paper—they were in her mind.

Sophia clenched her jaw and shoved the key against the man’s chest, sending him stumbling back. He caught it easily, then climbed into the car without another word.

As the vehicle disappeared down the street, Sophia whirled on Evelyn. "Why did you let them take everything? How will you prove the perfumes were yours now?"

Evelyn smirked. "Soph, do you really think I need those files to prove myself?" She leaned in slightly, her voice low. "Trust me. I have other ways."

Dominic had set a trap, but she wasn’t walking into it blindly.

Sophia still looked uncertain, but Evelyn’s confidence silenced further questions. "Weren’t you planning to leave DR Holdings? Why did you come back?"
###Chapter 21

Evelyn sank into the chair, her gaze lifting to meet Sophia's. "Bella, if you had to choose between DR Holdings and me—"

"Always you!" Sophia cut in before Evelyn could finish, her voice ringing with conviction.

The immediate response caught Evelyn off guard. A slow smile spread across her face.

It would have been ideal if Sophia could stay at DR Holdings. The company offered stability, and Sophia thrived in the lab—her temper flared in crowded rooms, but she was a genius when it came to perfumery.

Evelyn couldn't stay, but her departure would inevitably affect Sophia. The guilt gnawed at her. Yet, she hadn’t expected such unwavering loyalty.

Maybe DR Holdings gave me something after all, Evelyn mused.

Silence settled between them, warm and understanding. No words were needed.

"Oh, right," Sophia blurted, shifting the mood. "Are you really joining Phoenix Labs?" She hesitated, then added cautiously, "Could I… come with you?"

Job-hopping usually meant going solo or bringing an entire team. Bringing just one person—especially someone still establishing herself in the industry—was unusual.

Evelyn hadn’t discussed it with Phoenix Labs yet. Alexander Kensington had arranged her position. If she asked to bring Sophia along…

"Don’t worry if it’s not possible," Sophia said quickly, forcing a casual shrug. "I’ll find something else. It’s not like I’m helpless."

"No, it’s not that," Evelyn reassured her. "I’ll talk to them. If you want to come, I’ll make it happen." Sophia was more than an assistant—she was family.

"When do you start?" Sophia asked.

"Still negotiating. And I have loose ends to tie up here first."

"The documents?" Sophia’s expression darkened. "I have backups. But they took the hard copies!"

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "Dominic’s planning a press conference. He wants me to admit I lied during the competition."

Sophia shot up from her seat. "What?" Her voice trembled with outrage. "After everything we poured into those formulas? He steals the credit, and now he’s trying to ruin you? Does he have no shame?"

She knew better than anyone the sleepless nights, the skipped meals, the experiments they monitored for hours, napping on lab benches just to ensure the data was perfect.

They had bled for those fragrances.

And now Dominic was twisting the knife.

Sophia’s hands clenched into fists. "We won’t let him get away with this."
###Chapter 22

"What would Dominic fear most if he wants me to confess that I lied during the petition in front of everyone?"

Seeing Evelyn's confused expression, Vanessa continued, "It's the witnesses and evidence that could expose him. Sure, he took the physical evidence, but the witness..."

"Me? Am I the witness?" Sophia pointed at herself, realization dawning. "I can be the witness!"

She crossed her arms, determination flashing in her eyes. "We can use this to reveal his true nature—show the world exactly what kind of man he really is!"

Vanessa smiled, shaking her head lightly. "No, you won’t need to testify. I just need you to take a short vacation over the next couple of days."

"A vacation?" Sophia blinked.

"Exactly." Vanessa’s tone was firm. "Dominic doesn’t want you as his witness. He just wants no one to testify for me. If you disappear now, it works in his favor."

Sophia bit her lip. At this critical moment, she knew Dominic—who obsessed over every tiny detail—would never let her resign without a fight. Faking an illness seemed like the safest option.

But guilt gnawed at her. "Vanessa, I should be here with you, especially now. Running away makes me feel like a coward—like a soldier deserting the battlefield."

Vanessa chuckled. "Silly, we’re not at war. And you’re no deserter." She squeezed Sophia’s hand. "Trust me. I know what I’m doing. Didn’t you say you wanted to leave with me? Consider this your chance to rest—because soon, you’ll be very busy."

Though uncertainty lingered, Sophia nodded. Years of partnership had taught her to trust Vanessa’s instincts. "Alright. I’ll do it."

After leaving the café, Evelyn headed toward Phoenix Labs. As she waited for a taxi, a sleek black Maybach pulled up beside her. The window rolled down, revealing Alexander Kensington’s striking profile.

"Get in," he said, his voice smooth.

Evelyn hesitated for only a second before sliding into the leather seat.

"What are you doing here?" she asked, curiosity prickling. How did he know where I was?

His lips quirked. "Do I need a reason to see my fiancée?"

The car accelerated, merging into traffic as Alexander turned to study her.

"Of course not." Evelyn laughed, looping her arm through his. "I just didn’t expect you."

"Consider it a surprise."

She grinned. "A good one. But where are we going? I was heading to Phoenix Labs—I still have paperwork to finalize."

Last night’s meeting with the director had been brief. She’d even needed to Google the address beforehand. Now, she wondered if she should discuss it with Alexander.

"Not today," he said casually. "Tomorrow."

"Why not?" Evelyn frowned. It’s barely afternoon. Does he have other plans?

Alexander didn’t answer. Instead, he tilted his chin toward the rearview mirror.

Evelyn glanced back. A line of unmarked cars trailed them, their presence suddenly ominous. Her pulse spiked. Dominic’s men?

"What do we—"

Before she could finish, Alexander’s arm wrapped around her shoulders as the Maybach surged forward, weaving through traffic with practiced precision.
###Chapter 23

Alexander Kensington's Summit Trailhawk sped down Magnolia Avenue, leaving the pursuing vehicles far behind.

"Dominic must have sent his men to tail me," Evelyn Carter murmured, turning to face Alexander. "He's probably checking if I've reconnected with Phoenix Labs."

"Hmm?" Alexander arched an eyebrow. "Did you give him your word you wouldn't return?"

"I made no promises," Evelyn replied coolly. "But he likely believes he's manipulated me again." The old Evelyn would have trusted Dominic blindly, but not anymore. Not after witnessing his betrayal with Vanessa Blake firsthand.

"So what's your move now?" Alexander asked, genuinely intrigued. While he'd planned to avenge the wrongs done to her, it seemed his wife had her own methods of retribution.

Evelyn gazed calmly ahead. "He wants me to take the fall for the competition scandal at his press conference."

Alexander's voice turned icy. "When?"

"Tonight or tomorrow, I'd guess. He's desperate." Evelyn met his gaze. "Last night's events destroyed both his reputation and DR Holdings'. The investigation committee won't give him much time."

"You're not actually considering it?" Alexander couldn't imagine his sharp-witted wife bowing to Dominic's demands.

"Only if I've lost my mind," Evelyn said with quiet determination. "What's rightfully mine will return to me."

Alexander studied her serene expression - that timeless beauty that grew more captivating the longer one looked. Gently tucking a stray lock behind her ear, he murmured, "Lean on me whenever you need to."

The simple offer warmed Evelyn's heart. During her years with Dominic, she'd grown accustomed to handling everything alone. He'd always been too busy building his empire - too important for dinners, movies, or even conversations. Only during product launches would he spare her attention.

Now, hearing Alexander's words, unexpected tears pricked her eyes. She found herself leaning against his shoulder, whispering, "I will." The spontaneous gesture surprised Alexander, bringing an instant smile to his lips.

"Where are we going?" Evelyn asked, surprised by how natural it felt to be in his arms.

"To dinner," Alexander replied. "You haven't eaten, have you?"

Evelyn blinked in astonishment. "How did you know?" It was as if he could read her every need.
###Chapter 24

Alexander chuckled, his eyes glinting with amusement as if he could read Evelyn’s thoughts. "I’m not some creep who spies on people. I just happen to have functioning eyes and ears."

Without warning, he poked her stomach, and she jerked back with a laugh as the ticklish sensation sent a jolt through her. That was when she realized—her stomach had growled loudly, betraying her hunger.

Alexander led her to The Canopy, an upscale restaurant nestled halfway up the hill. It was renowned not just for its avant-garde architecture but for its breathtaking panoramic views.

In a world where Asian cuisine often signaled elite status, The Canopy stood out by offering an exquisite selection of Western dishes, crafted by their master chefs. The menu was a global tapestry—something for every palate.

Naturally, it came with a steep price tag, placing it out of reach for many. Reservations were mandatory, unless, of course, you were a VIP like Alexander, who seemed to have a permanent table waiting.

Evelyn’s gaze drifted to a woman across the room, elegantly handing the menu to her companion. The staff had rushed to attend to them the moment their car pulled up—clearly, they were regulars.

"Order whatever you like," Alexander said, leaning back in his chair.

The waiter appeared instantly. "What cuisine would the lady prefer? We have specialized menus available."

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn replied, "American, please."

She glanced at Alexander. "Is that alright with you?"

"I’m not picky," he said with a shrug.

It wasn’t that she was indecisive—it was the prices. The numbers on the menu made her pulse spike. She’d expected luxury, but this was another level. Even though Alexander was footing the bill, the extravagance made her wince.

"Something wrong?" Alexander’s brow arched when she remained frozen.

"Nothing. Just… overwhelmed by choices," she lied with a nervous laugh, though her struggle was obvious.

Alexander studied her for a moment before turning to the waiter. "Bring us your signature Western dishes for now. She can decide on the rest later."

"Of course, sir!" The waiter vanished, and Evelyn exhaled in relief. At least she didn’t have to agonize over the menu anymore. She set it aside, refusing to look at those terrifying digits again.

It wasn’t that she couldn’t afford it—she just wasn’t used to this lifestyle. Dominic had drilled frugality into her during their early struggles, and the habit had stuck. Funny how deeply ingrained some things became.

The food arrived swiftly, but just as Evelyn took her first bite, her phone buzzed. Sophia’s name flashed on the screen. She shot Alexander an apologetic look before answering.

"Evelyn, I got the leave approved!" Sophia’s voice was practically vibrating with excitement.

"Let me guess—he didn’t even hesitate?" Evelyn smirked, recognizing the triumph in her friend’s tone.

"Approved it instantly! He probably can’t wait to have me out of his sight. When I mentioned it was for a vacation, he even added extra days!" Sophia’s laughter was so loud Evelyn worried Alexander could hear every word. She cleared her throat.

"Well, enjoy your trip."

"Trip? Are you kidding? This is the worst time for me to disappear! Don’t you need me here? If Dominic tries to pin everything on you, I can back you up!"

Evelyn’s grip on her phone tightened. "I appreciate it, but—"

"No buts," Sophia cut in. "I’m not leaving you to deal with this alone."
###Chapter 25

"It's fine, Bella. Listen to me." Evelyn's voice was gentle but firm. "You've been drowning in work for far too long. You need this break."

A pause. Then, softer: "Because in a few days, you won’t have the luxury of resting, even if you beg for it."

Isabella sighed, but the corner of her mouth twitched. "Fine. But you know I have two phones, right? I’ve turned off the work one. If it’s urgent, call my personal line."

"Got it. Now go enjoy yourself!" Evelyn ended the call, only to find Alexander watching her with an unreadable expression.

She glanced down at herself—nothing out of place.

"What?" she asked.

His gaze didn’t waver. "You sent her away because you don’t want her dragged into this, don’t you?"

Evelyn froze, then exhaled a quiet laugh. "Not entirely." She speared a bite of seared scallop, savoring the buttery richness before continuing. "Bella was my assistant at DR Holdings. She knows everything—my research, my formulas, my methods."

She set her fork down, meeting his eyes. "Dominic won’t stop until he’s bled me dry. And Bella? She’d be his first target. The second he digs into the past, she’ll have no choice but to answer. She’s still under DR Holdings’ contract."

A shrug. "Better she’s far away when that happens."

Alexander said nothing, just watched as she devoured the rest of her meal with unapologetic relish. It had been months since she’d eaten something this decadent, and she wasn’t about to let etiquette ruin it.

His lips curved slightly.

"You seem confident," he remarked.

Evelyn dabbed her mouth with a napkin. "I’ve thought this through." Then, hesitating: "There’s one more thing I need from you."

Alexander leaned back, fingers steepled. "Go on."

"I want Bella at Phoenix Labs with me." The words tumbled out before she could second-guess them. "She’s brilliant. And I work better with her. Give us six months, and I swear we’ll deliver a perfume that’ll make Celestia Group profit. If not—"

"What?" His voice was dangerously soft.

"I’ll walk away."

Alexander laughed—a low, rich sound that sent a shiver down her spine. "Eternal Bloom took you three months. Why six now?"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her glass. "Because Eternal Bloom was a fluke." The admission burned. "A real perfume takes time—inspiration, trials, failures. We rushed it because Dominic needed a competition entry. That’s why one tweaked ingredient ruined the base notes." She pinched her thumb and forefinger together. "That’s how fragile it was."

Alexander’s gaze darkened. Then, without warning, he reached across the table.

Evelyn barely had time to blink before his thumb brushed the corner of her lip.

"You had a stain," he said casually, as if he hadn’t just short-circuited her brain.

The napkin in his hand was proof.

Evelyn’s cheeks flamed.
###Chapter 26

"I-I'm full." Evelyn lowered her head, her cheeks flushing pink. "You must be exhausted. Let's go home and rest."

Alexander Kensington's lips curved into a knowing smile. "I'll inform Harrison about your request. Don't worry." His reassurance eased the tension in Evelyn's shoulders.

It was comforting to have someone anticipate her needs before she even voiced them.

As they settled into the car, Alexander's fingers brushed against hers. "Are you leasing your current apartment?"

"Yes."

"Terminate the contract." His grip tightened around her hand. "Move in with me."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. She squeezed his fingers back, her gaze dropping to their intertwined hands.

Alexander didn't press her.

He simply waited, his thumb tracing slow circles over her knuckles.

She had known this moment would come—just not so soon.

But they were married now. They had shared a bed. It was only natural.

"Okay," she murmured.

"Good." His voice was warm. "We'll collect your things tonight."

True to his decisive nature, Alexander acted immediately.

The car soon pulled up outside Evelyn's modest apartment complex. She packed quickly—mostly clothes, a few keepsakes. The rest—bedding, kitchenware—she left behind.

She gathered her important documents into a folder, then called her landlord to terminate the lease.

Before leaving, she paused in the doorway, taking one last look.

This had been her sanctuary. Her independence.

She had once believed Dominic Reeves shared her dreams. That they were building something together.

But it had only ever been her dream.

Goodbye, old life.

Alexander raised an eyebrow when she returned with just one suitcase. "That's all?"

"Only what matters."

Thankfully, Dominic wasn't around. She wasn't in the mood for explanations. Not that he ever visited anymore.

The drive to Crestview Heights passed in comfortable silence. Alexander kept her hand in his, his thumb brushing absent patterns against her skin.

Crestview Heights—the most exclusive enclave in Veridian City. A gated community of sprawling estates, each meticulously designed by world-renowned architects.

Lush private gardens. Cutting-edge smart homes. A symbol of wealth and power.

That Alexander lived here was no surprise.

But Evelyn hadn't expected the mansion to feel so... empty.

No staff. Just the quiet hum of automated systems.

"You live here alone?" she asked, glancing around the grand foyer.

Alexander pressed a key into her palm. His smile was slow, deliberate.

"Not anymore."
###Chapter 27

Alexander loosened his tie with a sigh.

"I prefer peace and quiet," he said, his voice low. "But someone will come to clean the house every couple of days."

He glanced at Evelyn, who stood frozen near the walk-in closet.

"I'm going to shower. You can settle in first."

With that, he disappeared into the ensuite bathroom, leaving Evelyn alone in the vast master bedroom.

The sound of running water soon filled the silence.

Evelyn exhaled, grateful for the moment to adjust. The mansion was enormous—three sprawling floors, with the loft at the top. The architecture was sleek, all sharp lines and cool tones, much like Alexander himself.

She stepped into the walk-in closet and nearly gasped.

It was the size of a small apartment.

Two sections were already filled with Alexander's tailored suits and crisp dress shirts, while the rest remained empty. Evelyn unpacked her meager belongings, hanging each piece with care before retrieving a small file from her bag.

Her ID, diploma, and other essentials were inside—but the marriage certificate was missing.

Alexander had taken both copies yesterday.

She frowned. She'd have to ask him about it later.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket.

Dominic Reeves.

Evelyn hesitated before answering. "Hello?"

"Evelyn, where the hell have you been?" His voice was sharp, accusatory.

She nearly laughed. Since when did he care? "I didn't realize my whereabouts concerned you, Mr. Reeves."

She slid the file into a drawer, her tone light but edged with steel.

Dominic scoffed. "Is that any way to speak to me?"

"I think I'm being perfectly civil."

She stepped out of the closet—and froze.

Alexander stood just feet away, freshly showered, a white towel slung low around his hips. Water droplets glistened on his sculpted chest, trailing down his abdomen.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Dominic was still talking, his voice tinny through the phone. "Did DR Holdings contact you? Don’t tell me you’re still buying into Phoenix Labs’ lies. You know me better than that, Evelyn. There’s nothing between Vanessa and me—"

A soft gasp cut through his words.

Vanessa was there with him.

Evelyn barely registered it.

Alexander stepped closer, his presence overwhelming.

She could count every drop of water on his skin.

Dominic’s voice faded into white noise.

The only thing that mattered was the man in front of her.
###Chapter 28

Evelyn's fingers twitched with the urge to trace the contours of Alexander's sun-kissed skin, the defined muscles beneath begging for her touch. Her throat tightened as she swallowed hard.

"Evelyn? Evelyn?!" Dominic's voice crackled through the phone, sharp with impatience when met with silence. He thought she'd disconnected.

Her breath hitched as Alexander's towering frame leaned in, his presence overwhelming. His chiseled features drew nearer, the heat of his body radiating against her skin.

Just as their lips were about to meet—

He tilted his head at the last second, brushing his lips against the delicate curve of her cheek, right beside her ear. Then, without another word, he straightened and strode toward the walk-in closet.

Thud.

The phone slipped from Evelyn's grasp, tumbling onto the plush carpet. A small mercy—had it hit the hardwood, it would've shattered.

Dominic's voice pierced through the speaker, sharp and demanding. "Evelyn! What the hell was that? Are you even listening?"

She crouched to retrieve the phone, wiping it clean with deliberate calm. "Mr. Reeves, what is it you wanted to say?" Her tone was measured, though her pulse still raced.

"You—!" He bit back his frustration, reminding himself to keep his temper in check—at least until after the press conference.

"The press conference is tonight," he said, forcing composure. "Meet me at DR Holdings. We'll go over everything on the way. We need to contain this scandal before it does irreversible damage."

Evelyn scoffed. "And what about the damage to me?"

A pause. Then, in a voice laced with false warmth, he murmured, "Evelyn, you know how much DR Holdings means to us. It's our legacy. You've poured your soul into it—surely you don’t want to see it ruined?"

She clenched her jaw.

"Once this blows over," he continued smoothly, "we’ll get married. Just like we planned."

Empty promises. She’d heard them before.

"Fine," she relented, feigning reluctant agreement. "You're right. I have sacrificed too much to let it crumble now."

But if I built it up, I can tear it down just as easily.

Dominic exhaled in relief. "Good. Get here as soon as you can."

The moment the call ended, Evelyn straightened—only to find Alexander already in his robe, as if preparing to retire for the night.

"I have to leave," she said bluntly. "The press conference is tonight."

No point hiding it. He’d find out eventually.

Alexander arched a brow, closing the distance between them with slow, deliberate steps. "No need to rush. It’s still early." His voice was a low purr. "I’ve already drawn your bath. Everything you need is ready."
###Chapter 29

Rumors painted Alexander Kensington as cold-blooded, ruthless, and cruel. No one could have imagined the tenderness he showed toward another person.

The bathwater was perfectly warm. Evelyn Carter sank into the tub, letting the heat soothe her aching muscles. After changing into fresh clothes—soft fabric against her skin—she felt the tension in her body ease.

Her cramps had dulled to a manageable ache, a relief she hadn’t expected.

Alexander had been right. She didn’t need to rush. Rest was what she needed.

Curled against him, she drifted into a light sleep, his arms a steady weight around her. There was safety in his embrace, a quiet comfort that settled deep in her bones.

They didn’t speak. Didn’t move beyond the gentle press of bodies. Just stillness, warmth, and the steady rhythm of his breathing.

When she woke, her phone buzzed incessantly—Dominic Reeves had called her a dozen times.

She dressed slowly, smoothing the white fabric of her dress over her hips. Simple. Elegant. Perfectly fitted.

Before she could leave, Alexander caught her wrist, pulling her back. His lips brushed the curve of her neck, teeth grazing skin just enough to make her shiver.

"I don’t want to let you go."

"I’m yours," she murmured, turning in his arms. "No matter where I am."

His kiss was fierce, possessive, as if he could brand the promise into her.

Then, with a final press of his mouth to hers, he released her.

"Harrison will wait for you. Come back when it’s done."

She nodded and stepped into the hallway, the weight of his gaze lingering on her back.

The moment she arrived at the venue, Dominic stormed toward her, fury tightening his features.

"Where the hell were you?" His voice was a sharp hiss. "I called you a dozen times! Are you working with Phoenix Labs again? Do you not understand how important this is?"

Evelyn met his glare with icy calm. His words faltered.

"Let’s go," she said, turning toward the entrance.

Dominic didn’t lead her inside immediately. Instead, he pulled her into a secluded hallway, his grip tight on her arm.

"You know what to say," he muttered, low and urgent. "After today, DR Holdings will be stronger than ever. You’ve always been smart, Evelyn. Don’t ruin this."

She smiled faintly, silent.

His fingers dug into her shoulders as he leaned in, breath hot against her ear.

"I trust you," he whispered. "But if you betray me, you’ll regret it."

Then he stepped back, his expression smoothing into something warm, affectionate—a mask for the cameras.

Evelyn’s smile vanished.

She walked into the press room, blinking against the sudden flash of cameras. Reporters surged forward, lenses pointed at her like weapons.

She straightened her spine and stepped onto the stage.

A row of executives from DR Holdings sat at the long table, the three center seats reserved for Dominic, Evelyn, and Vanessa Blake.

The room hummed with anticipation.

Evelyn took her seat, her face a perfect mask.

The show was about to begin.
###Chapter 30

Evelyn Carter glided across the stage and took her seat with effortless elegance. Vanessa Blake had arrived early, positioning herself strategically. When Evelyn settled in, Vanessa shot a glance toward Dominic Reeves, who responded with a subtle thumbs-up.

The gesture brought Vanessa a sliver of comfort.

The press conference began without preamble. Dominic cut straight to the chase.

"By now, you've all heard about the incident at last night's perfumery competition." His voice carried across the packed room. "Certain misunderstandings have arisen."

He paused for effect, letting the tension build. "That's why we've gathered you here today - to clarify these matters with your assistance." Another deliberate pause. "The fragrance 'Eternal Bloom,' one of DR Holdings' competition entries, received widespread acclaim."

Dominic's expression turned grave. "However, when two companies present identical creations, it naturally raises concerns about intellectual property rights."

His gaze swept the room. "The involved parties are present today, so I'll keep this brief." He turned toward the women beside him. "I'll now yield the floor to our perfumers for their statements."

Vanessa accepted the microphone first. Her form-fitting black dress commanded attention, creating a striking visual contrast against Evelyn's ivory gown.

"Good afternoon everyone," Vanessa began with practiced charm. "I'm Vanessa Blake, Chief Perfumer at DR Holdings." The emphasis on her title made Evelyn's lips twitch with suppressed amusement.

Vanessa continued smoothly. "As Mr. Reeves explained, I won't rehash the details. But I will say this - in my career, I've learned dedication outweighs raw talent every time."

She leaned forward slightly. "True mastery comes from relentless study, from countless hours in the lab perfecting each note. There are no shortcuts in this art." Her gaze sharpened. "Dishonesty might offer temporary gains, but it never builds lasting success. Wouldn't you agree, Evelyn?"

The room's focus shifted abruptly to Evelyn. Cameras clicked furiously, capturing every microexpression.

Vanessa's words carried clear implication - she painted herself as the wronged artist, Evelyn as the plagiarist.

Evelyn let the silence stretch just long enough to become uncomfortable before responding. "Ms. Blake makes excellent points." Her voice remained measured. "Integrity is indeed paramount in our craft. And yes, perseverance does trump natural ability."

Flashbulbs erupted again as reporters leaned forward eagerly.

Dominic and Vanessa maintained their professional smiles, but unease prickled beneath the surface. Evelyn was parroting Vanessa's words verbatim - so why did they sound so ominous coming from her?

"Ms. Carter!" A reporter from NovelDrama.Org called out. "Are you admitting you stole Ms. Blake's formula?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a mysterious smile. "I said no such thing."

The room erupted in murmurs. Camera shutters clicked like angry insects as journalists shouted follow-up questions.

The real drama was just beginning.
###Chapter 31

Dominic Reeves seized the microphone first, his voice smooth and calculated. "Naturally, this isn't considered theft."

He adjusted his tie, his expression carefully composed. "Evelyn has been part of DR Holdings for years. She worked closely with Vanessa Blake, contributing to our fragrance development in significant ways."

His tone softened, feigning magnanimity. "I won't label this as plagiarism—that would be too harsh. In our industry, certain overlaps are inevitable. We're willing to give Evelyn another chance, and we hope DR Holdings continues to innovate."

Dominic had spent years mastering media manipulation. His words struck the perfect balance—firm yet forgiving, condescending yet convincing.

The reporters nodded, some even casting pitying glances at Evelyn. The narrative was clear: an ambitious assistant, desperate for recognition, had stolen company secrets.

Yet, a few sharp-eyed journalists caught inconsistencies.

One stood abruptly. "Evelyn previously stated she was never formally employed by DR Holdings. No contract was signed."

Dominic's smile didn't waver. "An oversight, I admit. But Evelyn and I were university classmates. We trusted each other—perhaps too much."

He gestured magnanimously. "We've since drafted a contract with excellent terms. I believe this misunderstanding will only strengthen DR Holdings' future."

The room erupted in applause.

Dominic exhaled, relief flickering across his face—until another reporter cut in.

"Ms. Carter, shouldn't you apologize publicly? And what about the investors? If they were misled, isn’t this fraud? Will they sue?"

The questions grew sharper, the stares more accusatory.

Dominic opened his mouth—but Evelyn snatched the microphone.

Her grip was steady, her voice cutting through the murmurs. "Excellent questions. Let me address the first."

She paused, letting the silence stretch. "I won't apologize—because I don’t owe one."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Whispers erupted. "How shameless!" "She can't be serious!"

Evelyn didn’t flinch. Her gaze swept the room, cool and unyielding.

"Let me clarify. Eternal Bloom is my creation. My assistant and I spent three months perfecting it."

She tilted her chin up. "And let’s not forget—most of DR Holdings’ bestselling perfumes? Those were mine too."
###Chapter 32

The press corps buzzed with anticipation. Dominic Reeves' confident declaration and Evelyn Carter's serene smile had lulled them into thinking this would be another predictable corporate reconciliation.

How wrong they were.

Evelyn had just publicly humiliated Dominic without raising her voice. Camera lenses swiveled violently between Dominic's rapidly paling face and Evelyn's unshakable composure. The contrast couldn't have been more striking.

"Ms. Carter, are you suggesting Vanessa Blake stole your work instead?" A journalist shouted over the growing murmur.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Let me clarify terminology."

Her voice carried effortlessly across the room. "Plagiarism implies imitation. What we're discussing is outright theft - the appropriation of intellectual property with malicious intent."

The reporter blinked. "So... grand larceny of ideas?"

Evelyn merely arched an eyebrow.

Dominic's fist hit the podium. "Evelyn! Explain yourself!"

Veins stood out on his forehead. The man who'd orchestrated this press conference now looked ready to bolt from it. Yet Evelyn's gaze never wavered from the journalists, like a chess master surveying the board.

"Ms. Carter," challenged another reporter, "without employment contracts from DR Holdings, how can you prove you developed their flagship product?"

Vanessa chose that moment to intervene, her manicured nails digging into the microphone stand. "Are you accusing me of corporate espionage, Evelyn?"

The room held its breath.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Would you prefer I used softer language, Vanessa?"

Her delivery was devastating - honeyed words laced with arsenic. The press corps erupted, cameras flashing like lightning.

Vanessa's smile turned rigid. Beneath the professional veneer, fury radiated from every stiff movement. "Let's not speak in riddles. State your accusations plainly."

Every journalist leaned forward, recorders extended like weapons. This was the moment the corporate war would be declared in earnest.
###Chapter 33

Evelyn Carter offered a faint smile as she studied Vanessa Blake. "Are you certain that's what you want? Should I reveal the truth right here?" Her calm demeanor sent a ripple of unease through Vanessa.

What was Evelyn scheming? What did she truly want? She had laid all her cards on the table, and now there was no turning back.

Vanessa clenched her teeth, forcing herself to sound composed. "Don't embarrass yourself, Evelyn. I've done nothing wrong."

She straightened her shoulders. "I may not be the most naturally gifted in this industry, but no one can deny my dedication. Everyone knows how much I've contributed to DR Holdings over the years."

Her voice hardened. "You can't just waltz in here and spread baseless accusations."

"Vanessa." Dominic Reeves stepped closer, his fingers brushing her forearm in silent support.

He turned back to Evelyn, clearing his throat. "I apologize. The purpose of this press conference was to clarify matters with the competition committee and our valued consumers."

His tone turned diplomatic. "However, we didn’t prepare adequately, and Ms. Blake wasn’t given enough time to process these unexpected allegations."

Evelyn cut him off. "Do you want proof?"

Four simple words, and every camera in the room snapped toward her.

She lifted her phone, her expression unreadable. "Since everyone demands evidence, here it is."

A reporter leaned forward. "Ms. Carter, what exactly is this proof you're referring to?"

The tension in the room thickened. Neither side was backing down, and the reporters were caught in the middle, unsure whom to believe.

"The evidence is—" Evelyn began, but Vanessa abruptly stood, her chair scraping loudly.

"Every employee at DR Holdings can vouch for me!" Vanessa declared, her voice sharp. "They know exactly who created those perfumes!"

Her eyes burned with defiance. "I tried to spare you the humiliation, Evelyn, out of respect for our past. But you’re too arrogant to admit your own mistakes."

She snatched up her purse. "I won’t entertain your games any longer. See you in court."

With that, she flung the microphone onto the table and stormed out.

The room erupted in murmurs. No one had expected such a dramatic exit.

Even Dominic was caught off guard. He reached for her, but she was already gone.

The reporters' gazes flicked between him and Evelyn, waiting for his next move.

He exhaled sharply. "My apologies. This concludes today’s press conference."

With a stiff nod to the crowd, he shot Evelyn a glare before striding after Vanessa without a backward glance.

Evelyn remained standing, the sole focus of the room.

Dominic had left her to face the media alone—just as she always knew he would.

"Ms. Carter," a journalist called out, "it seems Ms. Blake intends to sue you."
###Chapter 34

"Ms. Carter, do you truly possess evidence, or is this merely fabrication? Have you considered the consequences if this case proceeds to trial?" Evelyn surveyed the skeptical crowd with calm composure.

Her poised demeanor and quiet confidence hushed the murmurs around her.

Parting her crimson lips slightly, she uttered four decisive words: "File the lawsuit."

Evelyn had anticipated obstacles, but she hadn’t expected Dominic to intercept her in the dimly lit alley.

Hadn’t he just chased after Vanessa? Why was he still lingering?

Dominic’s expression was stormy, his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets as he leaned against the brick wall. The shadows swallowed his form, amplifying his menacing aura.

Evelyn hesitated, her steps faltering. She had no intention of engaging with him.

She turned sharply, intending to leave, but found her path blocked by two broad-shouldered men.

Ah. So that’s why Dominic had been whispering to his associates earlier.

Had he orchestrated this? If so, it was the first time he’d ever bothered to pay her such attention.

Trapped, Evelyn squared her shoulders and approached him. "Is this a threat, Mr. Reeves? Or an abduction?"

Dominic pushed off the wall and closed the distance between them.

He didn’t raise his voice, but fury radiated from him in waves.

The sharp click of his leather shoes against the pavement echoed ominously.

Evelyn’s gaze flickered to the surroundings—no security cameras in sight.

How meticulous of him.

"Evelyn." His voice was deceptively soft, but the weight behind it was crushing. "What the hell are you playing at?"

"Shouldn’t you already know?" she countered icily.

"Didn’t we have an agreement?" His patience frayed.

He tried one last time to reason with her. "What exactly do you hope to achieve by turning against DR Holdings—against me? What did Phoenix Labs offer you? Don’t be a fool. Do you honestly believe they’ll treat you as anything more than a pawn?"

His voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "They’re using you as a weapon. DR Holdings has surged ahead in the market. The competition is ruthless, and rivals will exploit any weakness. You’re walking into a trap. Once they’ve squeezed you dry, they’ll discard you without a second thought."

Dominic had convinced himself Phoenix Labs was behind this.

What promises had they made? What lies had they fed her?

It couldn’t be about Vanessa—Evelyn would’ve confronted him directly if she knew.

She studied him with detached amusement.

How effortlessly he spun lies without so much as a flicker of guilt. The concern in his voice almost sounded genuine.

"Evelyn, stop this madness. Don’t throw away everything we’ve built. There’s a line, even in anger. If you persist, you’ll regret it."

His hand shot out, gripping her shoulder. "Did someone from Phoenix Labs contact you again? You—"

"I reached out to them."

Evelyn glanced pointedly at his hand before shrugging free.
###Chapter 35

Dominic's breath caught in his throat. "What did you just say?"

"It's not that I never considered giving you another chance." Evelyn's voice dripped with frost. "But even now, you still expect me to take the fall for you."

She tilted her head, lips curling into a mocking smile. "Tell me, Dominic. Do I look that naive to you?"

An icy shiver ran down Dominic's spine. The woman standing before him felt like a complete stranger - not the devoted partner he'd known for years. This version of Evelyn was razor-sharp, unpredictable, and utterly beyond his control. "Evelyn, what's gotten into you? You don't trust me anymore?"

"I trusted you so blindly I don't even recognize myself anymore." Evelyn cut him off with a dismissive wave. "Thank God I never signed those contracts with DR Holdings. Consider our professional relationship terminated, effective immediately."

She emphasized the word "your" as she moved to walk past him.

Dominic's hand shot out, fingers digging into her forearm. He didn't fully grasp her meaning, but instinct screamed not to let her leave. "Is this about the unsigned contracts?" His voice took on a placating tone. "Evelyn, be reasonable. If that's what you wanted, you should have said something sooner. Why create drama now?"

"DR Holdings belongs to you." Evelyn winced at his tightening grip. "Or did you forget that little detail? You're the one backing everyone into a corner here."

Evelyn yanked her arm free with a glare. "Let. Me. Go."

"Not until you explain yourself." Dominic caught himself, softening his tone. He lowered his gaze, mind racing. A realization struck him, and when he looked up again, his expression had shifted to something almost tender. "Evelyn... are you jealous?"

The thought that Evelyn might have discovered his affair with Vanessa never crossed his mind. Evelyn had always dismissed such rumors, so devoted was her faith in him. A few sweet words had always been enough to reassure her.

Yet her recent behavior - especially around Vanessa - had been peculiar. Dominic decided to test his theory. "Is this about Vanessa?" He watched her face carefully for reactions.

Evelyn's stony silence only confirmed his suspicions.

"Evelyn, really?" Dominic released her arm with an exaggerated sigh, shaking his head in disappointment. "After all these years together, I thought our bond was unbreakable. That we could weather any storm. But for you to doubt me like this..."

"Whatever you think you saw or heard, it's not what it seems. The three of us have known each other forever! If I wanted something with Vanessa, it would have happened ages ago." He reached for her shoulders, voice dripping with sincerity. "Don't let petty gossip come between us, Evelyn. Those people just want to watch the world burn."

As he tried to pull her into an embrace, Evelyn stepped back sharply, evading his touch. "Is that so?" Her voice held dangerous calm.

Dominic doubled down on his act. "Of course! Remember our promise? If we won this competition, we'd get married." His eyes shone with feigned devotion. "If you don't believe me, let's do it now. Let's get married today!"
###Chapter 36

The world around him blurred into insignificance. Only one thing mattered now—calming Evelyn down.

Dominic's words made Evelyn sick. These were the words she had longed to hear for years, yet now, they tasted like poison. Marriage? In his wildest dreams.

"That won't be necessary. If you want to prove yourself, there’s a simpler way," Evelyn said, exhaling softly as she wiped the mocking smirk from her lips.

Seeing her expression shift, Dominic thought he had swayed her.

He took a step closer, his voice dripping with persuasion. "Exactly. Trust is everything. You’ve stood by me through every storm. You’ll do it again, won’t you?"

"Fine. I have a solution," Evelyn nodded, her tone measured. "One that proves you’re not involved with Vanessa and saves DR Holdings from ruin."

Dominic’s eyes lit up. "What is it?"

The idea of solving two problems at once thrilled him.

For days, he had been scrambling to control the media fallout, but public opinion remained vicious. Sales had plummeted. Reputation was everything for a company like DR Holdings, and right now, theirs was in tatters.

Evelyn watched the desperation flicker in his gaze. At least he was right about one thing—she had always bailed him out. Every crisis, every failure, she had been the one to fix it. She had poured her soul into creating their bestselling perfumes, believing she was building their future together.

How foolish she had been.

"It’s simple," she said, tilting her head. "We return to the press conference. You announce to every reporter that I created every award-winning perfume DR Holdings has ever released. That I was the mind behind every success. Will you do it?"

Dominic’s face paled. She had outmaneuvered him completely, and the weight of her demand pressed down on him like a vise.

"You’re asking me to sign my own death warrant," he hissed through clenched teeth.

Evelyn laughed, the sound sharp and cold. "How dramatic. Isn’t it the truth? I did craft every bestseller. All you have to do is admit it. Surely that’s not too hard?"

"Evelyn, you never cared about recognition before. Why now?" His voice turned accusing. "Is fame more important to you than us?"

He was refusing, of course. And now he was twisting it, making her the villain. Fame? Glory?

How many times had he used those same empty words to keep her in the shadows? She had sacrificed everything for him, content to stay hidden while he took the credit. And now, he thought those tired manipulations would work again?

"Yes," she said, her smile razor-thin. "It is important. I didn’t care before, but I do now. Fame. Money. Justice. Can you give me those, Dominic?"

Her brows arched, daring him to answer.
###Chapter 37

Dominic's expression darkened as the concern drained from his face. His jaw tightened, and his eyes turned icy as they locked onto Evelyn.

"Are you threatening me?" His voice was low, dangerous.

Evelyn met his gaze without flinching. "I only want what's fair." Her demand was simple, uncomplicated. She wasn’t asking for more than she deserved—just no longer willing to let others take what was rightfully hers.

A humorless laugh escaped Dominic’s lips. He tugged at his tie, loosening it with restless fingers before undoing the top button of his shirt. His stance widened, arms crossing over his chest as he loomed over her.

"What exactly do you deserve?" His tone dripped with condescension. "For years, I paid for everything—your clothes, your food, your rent. What more could you possibly claim?"

Evelyn studied his face, once so familiar, now twisted into something unrecognizable. The absurdity of his words made her laugh—a bitter, hollow sound. Not at him, but at herself. How had she ever been blind enough to love a man like this?

Her silence only fueled his arrogance.

"Don’t get ahead of yourself just because you mixed a few perfumes," he sneered. "Who provided the materials? Who rented the lab? Without me, you’d have nothing."

Slowly, Evelyn lifted her chin. "So you admit that most of DR Holdings’ perfumes were my creations?"

Dominic scoffed. "And what of it? Do you think they’d sell without marketing, without operations? You’re nothing without the company behind you."

His argument might have sounded reasonable—if it weren’t so full of holes. But Evelyn didn’t bother pointing them out. She simply smiled.

"Good. At least you admit it." She turned to leave. There was nothing left to say.

"Wait!" Dominic lunged forward, grabbing her arm. In the struggle, something clattered to the floor.

Evelyn snatched it up before he could, clutching it to her chest.

Dominic’s eyes widened in disbelief. "You recorded this?" His voice was sharp with betrayal. The woman he’d once thought so docile, so pliable—she’d outplayed him.

His hand shot out, trying to seize the device, but Evelyn twisted away.

"If you have nothing to hide, why does it matter?" she challenged.

Dominic didn’t try again. Instead, he laughed—cold, calculated. "You think this changes anything? I could claim you edited it, manipulated my words. And do you really believe I haven’t prepared for this?" His smirk was venomous. "See you in court, Evelyn."

She turned to leave—only to find her path blocked.

Dominic remained where he stood, lighting a cigarette with deliberate calm. The flame flickered in his eyes as he exhaled smoke.

"You’re not letting me leave?" Evelyn arched a brow.

"I didn’t want it to come to this," he said, almost regretful. "We had good times, didn’t we?"

But the threat in his voice was unmistakable.
###Chapter 38

Dominic Reeves held his cigarette between his fingers, tilting his head as he absently scratched his scalp with his pinky.

He took slow, deliberate steps toward her. "Still, I should be courteous enough to make the stakes clear," he said, his voice dripping with condescension. "Since you insist on being so stubborn, I have no choice but to calm you down first. Then we can talk."

With a dismissive flick of his chin, he signaled to his men and turned away. This was beneath him—he shouldn’t have to dirty his hands with something so trivial.

Then came the sharp whistle of wind, followed by the sickening thuds of fists and feet meeting flesh. Dominic frowned. Why were his bodyguards struggling with one woman?

He barely had time to turn before a cold blade pressed against his throat. The steel glinted dangerously in the dim light, sending a shiver down his spine. Sweat beaded at his temples.

"W-What the hell are you doing?" he choked out.

"That depends on your next move," Evelyn Carter replied, her voice icy. There was no hesitation in her grip, no flicker of weakness.

Dominic’s mind reeled. The past few days had been a nightmare—a woman he thought he knew, someone he had loved for years, now standing before him like a stranger. Was this really Evelyn? Or had she always been this ruthless?

"You’re wondering how I know how to fight?" she sneered, reading his thoughts. "I learned because of you."

Dominic didn’t understand, but the blade at his throat was real. "Don’t be reckless! This isn’t a game. Put the knife down."

"My demand is simple," Evelyn said, disgust curling her lip as she watched him sweat. "Return what’s mine, and we’re done."

"Fine. I promise."

The pressure on his neck vanished. By the time he regained his composure, Evelyn was already walking away, her silhouette cutting through the dim light. Behind her, his bodyguards groaned on the ground, defeated.

Dominic cursed under his breath. This wasn’t supposed to happen. He had planned to sweet-talk her, manipulate her—but she had turned the tables.

Evelyn flexed her wrist as she strode toward the street, scanning for a taxi. It had been too long since she’d used her combat skills, and her knuckles ached. She had given up so much for Dominic, but no more.

Then—headlights.

A sleek car pulled up, its high beams blinding her. She shielded her eyes, squinting—and then her tense shoulders relaxed.

He was here.
###Chapter 39

"Why are you here?" Though she posed the question, Evelyn couldn't suppress the warmth spreading through her chest at the sight of Alexander.

Alexander studied her face intently before reaching over to adjust the car's temperature controls. His fingers brushed against the shawl draped across the backseat as he carefully wrapped it around her shoulders. "Did something happen?" His voice carried an edge of concern - by his calculations, she should have left the building twenty minutes ago. He'd nearly gotten out to search for her himself.

"It's nothing serious." Evelyn waved a dismissive hand, then immediately winced when the movement pulled at her sore muscles. The sharp inhale that escaped her lips made Alexander's grip tighten around her wrist.

"You're hurt." His stormy expression darkened further, jaw clenching visibly. The air between them grew heavy with his barely contained anger.

"N-No, just stiff from sitting too long," Evelyn lied hastily, twisting in her seat to face him fully. "See? Not a scratch on me." She forced a bright smile, hoping to distract him.

Alexander's piercing gaze never wavered. Without warning, he cupped her chin between thumb and forefinger, tilting her face toward the overhead light. His scrutiny traveled slowly from the delicate column of her neck down to her collarbones, then along both arms. Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks at his thorough inspection, though the unexpected tenderness soothed some of the ache in her chest.

The betrayal still stung. Five years she'd known Dominic - five years believing him to be kind and principled. How could she have been so blind? The cheating had been bad enough, but the manipulation, the gaslighting... And now this latest violation. Though she'd severed all ties, the wounds remained fresh.

"Promise me something." Alexander's thumb brushed lightly across her bottom lip, pulling her from her thoughts.

"What?"

His other hand encircled her wrist, pressing something cool and metallic against her skin. Evelyn glanced down to find an exquisite silver watch now adorning her slender wrist. The delicate timepiece seemed almost too refined for everyday wear, its intricate mechanisms visible through the transparent case back.

"I don't usually..." Her voice trailed off as she studied the unexpected gift.

"It's GPS-enabled with emergency calling." Alexander's tone brooked no argument. "You'll wear it at all times."

For a heartbeat, Evelyn simply stared. Then a laugh bubbled up, half-teasing. "Are you tracking me now?" Of course she understood the gesture's true meaning - a lifeline should she ever need him. The thoughtfulness made her chest tighten.

Alexander didn't smile. One hand still cradling hers, the other maintaining its possessive hold on her chin, he leaned closer. "Not tracking. Just ensuring I can always find you when you need me."

Evelyn's breath caught. In the confined space of the luxury vehicle, his proximity overwhelmed her senses. "Why?" The question slipped out before she could stop it. "Why go to such lengths for me?"

They'd known each other such a short time, yet Alexander had inserted himself into her life with unwavering determination. His protectiveness should have felt suffocating. Instead, it felt like... coming home.
###Chapter 40

The past week had been a revelation for Evelyn. Alexander had shown her kindnesses Dominic could never comprehend, let alone replicate in all their years together.

"You're my wife," Alexander murmured against her lips before claiming them in a tender kiss.

Though a blush warmed her cheeks, Evelyn didn't pull away. Her quiet surrender ignited something primal in Alexander. A satisfied smirk curved his lips as he deepened their connection.

Meanwhile, Dominic returned to his penthouse feeling utterly humiliated. Never in his wildest nightmares had he imagined being held at knifepoint - especially not by Evelyn!

Since when had she become so proficient in combat? How had this crucial detail escaped his notice? The realization made him wonder what other secrets she'd kept from him.

Crunch.

His polished Oxfords crushed broken porcelain beneath them. Vanessa sat amidst the wreckage of their living room, clutching a throw pillow like a lifeline. Spotting Dominic, she hurled it at him with surprising force. "I thought you'd abandoned me too!"

Dominic sidestepped, watching the pillow collide with the doorframe before tumbling to the marble floor.

"What's all this?" He retrieved the cushion, navigating the debris carefully before sinking onto the ruined sofa beside her. Even expecting this meltdown, the destruction still unsettled him.

"What does it look like?" Vanessa straightened, turning her tear-streaked face toward him. "Tell me, Dominic, what's our next move? You heard Evelyn at the press conference! I warned you she couldn't be trusted, but you wouldn't listen. Now she's declared war! I can't even check social media without seeing my name trending!"

"Since when do you care about online trolls?" Dominic countered. "You've done nothing wrong."

"Stop placating me!" Vanessa gripped his arm desperately. "I need solutions, not empty reassurances!" Her dramatic exit from the press conference had been unavoidable - staying would have only given Evelyn more ammunition.

"And storming out helped how exactly?" Dominic's glare could have frozen lava. "Do you realize how guilty that makes you look? The media will crucify us!"

"Staying would have been worse!" Vanessa's delicate features contorted. "She practically accused us of adultery to the entire world! Nate, what did I ever do to deserve this? I only ever loved you! Yes, I benefited from her formulas, but she had you!"

Her words struck a chord. The memory of cold steel against his throat sent shivers down Dominic's spine. If Evelyn still cared, she wouldn't have been so ruthless.

"If she wants war, she'll get war," Dominic said through clenched teeth. "So she knows the formula? Big deal. Without concrete evidence, it's just her word against ours. And we control all the evidence."

"You can't mean... a lawsuit?" Vanessa paled. She'd assumed they'd settle this with threats and intimidation.

"Oh, we're suing alright." Dominic's smile held no warmth. "And we're making sure the whole world watches."
###Chapter 41

Dominic wasn't bluffing. Within hours, a cease-and-desist letter from DR Holdings' legal team was plastered across their official website.

The document demanded Evelyn Carter issue a public apology and pay substantial damages for the financial losses incurred by the company.

It didn’t stop there. The same legal notice was aggressively circulated on Twitter, Reddit, and every major social platform. DR Holdings was making it clear—they weren’t backing down.

With DR Holdings taking such an uncompromising stance while Phoenix Labs remained eerily silent, public opinion swiftly turned against Evelyn.

Though the press conference had left some questioning the accusations, the lack of response from Phoenix Labs made doubters reconsider.

If Evelyn was innocent, why wasn’t she fighting back? Why hadn’t she presented any evidence to refute the claims?

Evelyn, however, wasn’t cowering. Instead of issuing a lengthy rebuttal, she simply reposted the legal notice with a single, biting caption: "Try me."

Two words. That was all it took.

Her response dripped with defiance, as if she found the entire legal threat laughable. The internet erupted. Within hours, the hashtag #TryMe was trending.

Perfume scandals rarely made headlines, but this feud had gripped the public’s attention. The back-and-forth accusations, the bold defiance—it was drama at its finest.

While netizens feasted on the spectacle, Evelyn remained unnervingly calm. She was on her way to Phoenix Labs when Sophia Grant called.

"Back from your vacation?" Evelyn asked, her tone light.

Sophia, however, was anything but relaxed. "I just saw DR Holdings’ legal letter. Are you okay? Do you need me to testify for you?"

Evelyn laughed. "No need."

"Don’t worry about me," Sophia insisted. "Even if I stay quiet now, Dominic won’t let me keep my job anyway."

Sophia had deliberately gone off-grid, switching to a personal phone to avoid the chaos. When she finally turned her work phone back on, she was bombarded with frantic messages demanding her immediate return.

She could guess why.

"It’s not about protecting you," Evelyn said after a pause. "I just don’t need it yet. If I do, I’ll let you know."

Sophia sighed. "Fine. Just… be careful."

She admired Evelyn. After working alongside her for years, she knew firsthand how brilliant she was. But this wasn’t just about talent—Dominic held all the power.

Evelyn had spent most of her time in the lab, isolated from the rest of the company. Sophia was the only one who could confirm the perfumes were truly hers.

And with the stolen materials, Evelyn had even less to work with.

So where was this unshakable confidence coming from?

Did Phoenix Labs have something up their sleeve?
###Chapter 42

Phoenix Labs was merely a subsidiary of Celestia Group, and its connection to the parent company remained unclear. No one from Phoenix had yet voiced any support for Evelyn. Sophia felt restless. Pressured by Dominic’s constant demands, she returned to the office to uncover what had happened. Meanwhile, Evelyn officially began her first day at Phoenix Labs. Though they had reached an agreement, the contract hadn’t been signed. An arrangement had been made the previous day for Evelyn to start immediately.

According to Alexander Kensington, Evelyn needed to familiarize herself with the company before her official start date. But due to her stubborn insistence, Alexander didn’t interfere too much. He left her onboarding to Harrison Sullivan. Still, Evelyn knew her arrival wouldn’t go smoothly.

Walking through the office, she reached the general manager’s office. Three people were waiting inside—two of whom she recognized.

"Mr. Whitmore."

Seated in the center was Gregory Whitmore, the general manager of Phoenix Labs. To his left was Theodore Montgomery, the HR manager. Evelyn had met both before. The woman beside them, however, was a stranger.

At Evelyn’s entrance, Gregory stood, circled the desk, and gave her shoulder a light pat. "Welcome to Phoenix Labs, Evelyn!"

"Hello, Mr. Whitmore. Mr. Montgomery." She greeted them politely before turning to the unfamiliar woman.

"Let me introduce you," Gregory said with a smile. "This is Victoria Sterling, our project department manager. She’s a force to be reckoned with in the business world. I hope you two will work well together."

"Hello, Ms. Sterling." Evelyn extended the greeting, though her instincts warned her this woman would be trouble.

Sure enough, Victoria gave only a slight nod before dismissing her with a glance. "Mr. Whitmore, the project department isn’t understaffed."

"Of course not," Gregory countered smoothly. "But we’re always in need of talent. Phoenix is still growing, and we need skilled individuals to elevate the company. Evelyn has that potential. Consider this an infusion of fresh energy into your team."

Victoria, however, wasn’t one to back down easily. She had no qualms challenging authority. "Does she? I’ve never heard her name mentioned in the industry."

She paused, feigning sudden recollection. "Ah, wait. There was that infamous 'perfumer without a nose'—Evelyn Carter—a few years back. Was that just a coincidence, or…?" Her tone was sharp, her gaze cutting.

Evelyn straightened, meeting her stare without flinching. "No coincidence. That was me."

"Oh?" Victoria arched a brow. "Has the bar for 'talent' fallen so low?"

Evelyn smiled, unfazed. "There were misunderstandings back then. Honestly, I’d nearly forgotten about it. Funny that you remember so clearly." She tilted her head. "Seems fate really wants us to work together."

Victoria’s expression darkened at Evelyn’s composed response. "Call it fate if you want. I’d call it misfortune."

Her smirk vanished as she turned to Theodore. "Mr. Montgomery, I refuse to allow an unqualified individual into my department. Especially one entangled in a lawsuit. Hiring her now is a terrible decision for this company."
###Chapter 43

Gregory Whitmore couldn't stand being questioned like this. His expression darkened as he spoke.

"Ms. Sterling, watch your tone."

Victoria Sterling didn’t back down. "There’s nothing wrong with my words. I’m just being honest. I don’t know Ms. Carter’s background, but I refuse to let a fraud join my team!" With that, she turned on her heel and stormed out of the office.

"Ms. Sterling! W-Wait—" The HR manager tried to stop her but failed, sighing in embarrassment. "Ms. Sterling is… direct, Mr. Whitmore. But she only has the company’s best interests at heart. Please don’t take her attitude personally."

Gregory scoffed. "If I minded her attitude, would she still be leading the project?" He turned to Evelyn Carter, softening slightly. "Don’t take her words to heart. That’s just how she is. Beneath the sharpness, she’s a good person. I believe you two will work well together."

Work well together? Evelyn highly doubted that, but she nodded anyway. "I understand the skepticism. But I’m grateful for this opportunity, Mr. Whitmore. I’ll prove myself through my work."

Gregory seemed pleased. Then, as if remembering something, he added, "The new product competition hasn’t been settled yet. DR Holdings is pushing hard. What’s your take on this?" His question was carefully worded, but the implication was clear—she needed to handle it.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "I’ll resolve it as soon as possible. The best way to prove myself is through results."

Gregory considered her words before patting her shoulder. "Good. But Phoenix Labs won’t interfere publicly, even though you’re under contract now. Understand?"

"Yes." Evelyn knew the stakes. If Phoenix Labs openly supported her, it could drag Celestia Group into the mess. She wasn’t avoiding the fight—she was just waiting for the right moment to strike.

Meanwhile, Sophia Grant marched straight to the CEO’s office upon returning to the company. No one stopped her—Dominic Reeves had summoned her. But as she raised her hand to knock, she overheard voices inside.

"Compile these documents and send copies to the lawyer. And don’t forget the online media. Hire the trolls discreetly." Dominic’s voice was cold, calculating.

Sophia’s breath hitched. Documents? The ones taken from the lab last time?

Those files were the key evidence linking her and Evelyn’s past work. And now, Dominic planned to weaponize them against Evelyn.

Worse, Evelyn seemed unfazed, while Sophia was panicking. I have to warn her. She pulled out her phone, typing frantically—

A tap on her shoulder made her jump. "Why are you standing out here?"

Sophia spun around. "I—I just got here."

The noise outside caught Dominic’s attention. "What’s going on?" His voice cut through the door.
###Chapter 44

The door creaked open as Lucas Bennett peeked inside. "Mr. Reeves, Sophia Grant is here."

Dominic Reeves barely glanced up from his desk. "Send her in."

Sophia shoved her phone into her pocket, forcing a tight smile as she stepped inside. Better assess the situation before telling Evelyn.

"Mr. Reeves," she greeted stiffly, then stood in silence, waiting. Truthfully, Sophia couldn’t stand Dominic. She’d spent years working alongside Evelyn in the lab, witnessing firsthand the relentless dedication Evelyn poured into her work.

Sophia had always prided herself on being diligent—top of her class, first in, last out. But Evelyn? She was on another level. There were nights Sophia had collapsed onto lab benches from exhaustion, only to wake hours later and find Evelyn still bent over her notes, analyzing data with bloodshot eyes.

And for what?

For him.

The man who’d thrown Evelyn’s devotion back in her face. Sophia clenched her fists, biting back the insults simmering on her tongue.

"Sophia," Dominic began, his voice dripping with false warmth. "Just back from vacation? How was it?"

Her smile turned brittle. "Cut short, thanks to you. According to my schedule, I still had half a day left."

Dominic’s jaw twitched, but his tone remained smooth. "We appreciate your flexibility. An urgent matter came up. Once resolved, I’ll triple your remaining leave."

"Triple?" She scoffed. "You’re joking."

"Of course not." He leaned forward, steepling his fingers. "But first, I need a small favor."

Vanessa Blake, lounging in the plush chair beside him, swung her legs lazily, the chair tilting with her movements. Sophia ignored her, keeping her gaze locked on Dominic.

"A favor?" Sophia arched a brow. "What could I possibly do for the great Dominic Reeves?"

Whether he missed the sarcasm or chose to ignore it, he pressed on. "Testify."

"Testify?"

"Yes. You’ve worked on DR Holdings’ perfumes for years. Your contributions have been invaluable." He nodded, as if praising a well-trained dog. "Once this case is settled, consider yourself promoted."

"Gee, thanks," she deadpanned. "But you still haven’t told me what I’m testifying about."

Dominic’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. "I need you to confirm Vanessa is DR Holdings’ true perfumer—that the recent bestsellers were her creations."

Sophia’s nails dug into her palms. "And what about Evelyn?"

The room went still.

Vanessa stopped swinging her legs.

Dominic’s expression darkened.

Sophia tilted her head, feigning innocence. "You know, the woman who actually made those perfumes?"

Silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

Then Dominic leaned back, his voice dropping to a dangerous murmur.

"Choose your next words carefully, Sophia."
###Chapter 45

Dominic Reeves tossed a thick envelope onto the polished mahogany desk with deliberate indifference. "Evelyn Carter violated company policy by joining a competitor, betraying DR Holdings in the process. That's why we terminated her employment." His lips curled into a calculated smile as he leaned back in his chair. "You've been with us for years, Sophia. We recognize your talent. Keep performing well, and the rewards will follow."

Sophia Grant's gaze lingered on the envelope. The flap had slipped open slightly, revealing crisp hundred-dollar bills stacked inside.

"Go ahead. Open it," Dominic urged, tilting his chin toward the envelope with a smug expression.

Sophia didn’t move. "Mr. Reeves, is this a bribe?" Her eyebrow arched, but her hands remained at her sides.

Dominic scoffed. "Don’t be absurd. This is the company’s way of showing appreciation. Stay loyal, follow orders, and you’ll be compensated accordingly."

A slow smile curved Sophia’s lips as she finally picked up the envelope and tucked it into her blazer pocket. "Then I’ll thank DR Holdings in advance."

Dominic exhaled subtly, satisfaction flickering in his eyes. If she took the money, she was theirs.

"Sophia," he continued smoothly, "since you’re the most familiar with our recent projects, you’ll be assisting Vanessa Blake from now on."

Vanessa rose from her seat, her sharp heels clicking against the floor as she approached. Her scrutinizing gaze raked over Sophia. "You worked closely with Evelyn. Did she teach you any of her little secrets?"

Sophia shook her head. "I wasn’t skilled enough to contribute creatively. Evelyn handled all the formulas—she was the best perfumer in the company."

Vanessa’s face twisted in irritation. "Enough! That traitor stole proprietary information, and she will pay for it. If you still admire her so much, you can join her in prison."

Sophia’s smile didn’t waver. Instead, she reached into her bag and placed her employee badge and a pre-written resignation letter on Dominic’s desk.

His composure shattered. "What the hell are you doing?" His voice cracked with disbelief. "You took the money! That means you agreed!"

Sophia patted her pocket. "This? You called it compensation for my years of service. Late nights, overtime, sacrifices—I earned this." Her tone turned icy. "But loyalty can’t be bought."

Dominic’s face darkened. "You’re not leaving. I refuse your resignation!"

Vanessa sneered. "Evelyn put you up to this, didn’t she?"

Sophia met her glare without flinching. "I stand with integrity, Ms. Blake. Evelyn dedicated everything to this company. Unlike you, I don’t betray the people who lift me up."

She turned on her heel, but Dominic’s roar followed her. "You walk out that door, and I’ll make sure you never work in this industry again!"

Sophia didn’t look back. "Then it’s a good thing I don’t plan to."

The door slammed behind her, leaving stunned silence in its wake.
###Chapter 46

The threat meant nothing to Evelyn. She stopped mid-step and turned slowly, her lips curling into a smirk at the sight of Dominic’s furious expression.

"Do as you please, Mr. Reeves," she said, her voice dripping with defiance. "From now on, I decide when I work and when I arrive. If you want to punish me for being late—or for skipping altogether—go right ahead."

With that, she pushed open the door and strode out, leaving behind a stunned silence.

Vanessa gaped at the empty doorway before whirling toward Dominic. "You just let her walk out like that? She’s going to run straight to the press with those ridiculous accusations! How could you let her leave?"

Dominic’s jaw clenched, his knuckles whitening as he slammed a fist onto the desk. "What was I supposed to do? We’re in the middle of DR Holdings. Half the building saw her come in here. Did you expect me to lock her up?"

Vanessa bit her lip, anxiety gnawing at her. Her carefully crafted reputation was already under scrutiny, and Evelyn’s sudden rebellion threatened to destroy everything. The thought made her blood boil.

None of it made sense. Evelyn had been compliant for years—docile, even. What had changed?

Dominic exhaled sharply, his fingers curling into fists. Veins stood out along his wrists as he fought to control his temper.

"We need to strike first," he growled, slamming his palm against the desk. When he looked up, his eyes were cold with resolve. "Get our lawyers here immediately. I’m suing her. And contact our old university classmates—the ones we were closest to."

Vanessa blinked, confused. "What? Why would we need them now? Are you planning some kind of reunion?"

She scoffed, shaking her head. "Or do you think they can talk sense into her? Please. Evelyn barely tolerated half of them back then. What makes you think she’d listen to them now?"

Dominic shot her an exasperated look. "Just do it. Find their contact details—especially the ones we had strong ties with. Trust me, it’ll be useful. And hurry."

His mind was already racing. I can’t let this drag on. Evelyn, if you’re determined to burn everything down, don’t blame me for what comes next. You started this war.

"Achoo!"

The sunlight was blindingly bright. Evelyn wrinkled her nose as she sneezed, only for a tissue to appear in front of her.

Flushing, she reached for it, but Alexander was already dabbing at her nose with surprising gentleness. He crumpled the tissue and tossed it into the bin before she could protest.

She stared at him, speechless. Alexander Kensington—the ruthless CEO of Celestia Group, the man who commanded fear in every boardroom—had just helped her blow her nose.

Her cheeks burned as his arm slid around her waist, pulling her close. "So," he murmured, his voice low and amused, "how was your first day back at work?"
###Chapter 47

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the windows, casting a warm glow over the room. Evelyn leaned against the kitchen counter, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup.

"It's not bad," she said, offering Alexander a small smile. "New environment, new colleagues. Feels like a fresh start—fitting, considering the company's name."

She didn’t mention the whispers, the sidelong glances, the way some of her coworkers had already dismissed her before she’d even proven herself. But she understood. Not everyone would welcome her, and that was fine. Some would warm up to her in time. Others never would.

Victoria had been right—Evelyn had no reputation, no track record to lean on. Just a string of legal battles still hanging over her head. Most companies wouldn’t touch her with a ten-foot pole. Yes, she’d gotten into Phoenix Labs through connections, but now? Now she had to prove she belonged here on her own merit.

"That’s good," Alexander murmured, his voice low. He dipped his head, pressing a soft kiss to her cheek.

He knew. Of course he knew. He was aware of every whisper, every doubt circulating in the office. But he wouldn’t intervene—not when she’d been so insistent on keeping their relationship private. He wanted to see how far she could go on her own. And he had no doubt she’d exceed every expectation.

The brush of his lips against her skin sent a shiver down her spine. But it wasn’t enough. His grip on her waist tightened as he leaned in again, this time capturing her lips. The warmth of his mouth, the way his fingers pressed into her hips—it made her pulse race.

Her hands clutched at his shoulders, her knees threatening to buckle. She didn’t dare push him further, though. Not when she knew exactly where this would lead if she did.

Then—her phone rang.

The sharp trill shattered the moment.

"I should get that," she murmured, pulling back slightly.

Alexander’s grip didn’t loosen. His jaw tensed as he glanced at the offending device. "Ignore it."

"Let me just see who it is first."

The stubborn set of his mouth made her want to laugh. Who knew the great Alexander Kensington could be so petulant?

Still, he didn’t release her.

The phone kept ringing. What if it was important? Rising onto her toes, she pressed a quick, appeasing kiss to his cheek.

But before she could pull away, he turned his head, catching her lips again in a searing kiss that left her breathless. Only when the ringing persisted did he finally relent.

Flushed, she hurried to grab her phone—and froze.

Dominic Reeves.

Her gaze flicked to Alexander, who was watching her with an unreadable expression.

"Do you want me to take it?" he offered, his voice deceptively calm.

She shook her head. "I’ve got it."

Swallowing hard, she answered—on speaker.

Dominic’s furious voice filled the room.

"Evelyn! Why the hell did you stop renting the apartment? And why wasn’t I the first to know?"
###Chapter 48

Evelyn was stunned into silence. She never expected Dominic to track her down over the apartment she used to rent.

The fact that he’d only just realized she no longer lived there meant he hadn’t bothered looking for her in days.

Her lips curled into a smirk as she glanced at Alexander, picking up her phone with deliberate leisure.

"Since I’m not staying there anymore, of course I’d stop renting the place. I dealt directly with the landlord, so why would I need to inform you, Mr. Reeves?"

"Don’t forget—I paid your rent for years! You!" Dominic’s voice crackled with barely contained fury before he forced himself to take a deep breath. "Where are you staying now? Phoenix Labs can’t possibly be providing you with food and accommodation, can they?"

He was convinced they’d brainwashed her. With his involvement with Vanessa, the truth would be harder to hide. There was no other explanation for Evelyn—once so obedient—changing overnight.

She nearly laughed out loud, especially standing mere steps away from the man who was providing for her now. Meeting Alexander’s gaze, she replied, "Actually, they do provide both. So you can stop worrying, Mr. Reeves. By the way—weren’t you threatening to sue me? Couldn’t afford the legal fees? The rental deposit’s still with the landlord. Maybe you can use that for your lawyers."

Dominic’s voice turned icy. "You think that recording of yours scares me? Recordings aren’t admissible in court. Even if they were, how would you prove it wasn’t edited? I could easily claim you manipulated me into saying those things."

"If you’re so confident, then I’ll be waiting." She ended the call before he could retort, then blocked his number. The silence that followed was bliss.

Only then did she notice Alexander watching her, his expression unreadable.

"Uh," she said after an awkward pause. "Don’t worry. Once this is over, I’ll never speak to him again."

When they’d gotten engaged, she’d promised him loyalty. And she wasn’t the type to keep ties with an ex.

"Did I say I was worried?" Alexander tilted his head slightly. "But—what recording was he talking about?"

She blinked, then realized he was referring to Dominic’s earlier remark.

"At the press conference, he—" That day, Dominic had cornered her with bodyguards, trying to drag her away. Her boxing training had saved her.

"It’s nothing. Just a bluff."

"A bluff?" His brow arched.

She misread his tone. "I’d never lie to you. Only to him—because he lied first."

"I trust you," he said, reaching out to tuck a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "But provoking him like this—are you sure? Legally, you’re at a disadvantage. DR Holdings’ employees will side with him. The evidence you have now isn’t enough."

He already had a plan to end this. But he wanted to see how she would handle it.
###Chapter 49

Evelyn Carter smiled faintly. "I'm not afraid of them. That's exactly what I want."

"Oh?" Alexander Kensington studied her for a moment before asking, "You have backups of all their data?"

As a perfumer, it was standard practice for Evelyn to maintain duplicate records of her research. She conducted countless experiments on fragrances each year, making minor adjustments along the way. Each study spanned months, so having backups allowed her to cross-reference for missing data or errors.

"I did," she admitted. "But he took those too."

Before, she had been defenseless against Dominic Reeves. She hadn’t thought to transfer or hide her research elsewhere because she had trusted him implicitly. Everything had been stored in the company’s database, and Dominic had sent his men to confiscate it all days ago.

Alexander’s eyes narrowed as he processed her words. "Then I don’t understand. If you have no evidence left, why are you still so confident?"

Initially, Evelyn hadn’t planned to share everything with him, but since he asked, she saw no reason to hold back. "It’s simple. I wasn’t cautious around Dominic before, so I kept all my data in the company’s system. But a few days ago, he sent his people to seize everything. Isabella was there, but she couldn’t stop them."

The memory resurfaced, sharp and bitter. It only reinforced her belief that Dominic wasn’t just dishonest—he was ruthless. He had stripped her of every shred of proof, leaving her unable to defend herself against accusations of plagiarism. He hadn’t cared that she was his former classmate, let alone someone he had once claimed to love.

Evelyn paused, waiting for Alexander’s reaction. When he remained silent, she continued.

"However, I have one habit."

"What habit?" His curiosity was piqued.

Evelyn smirked, a glint of mischief in her eyes. "When I take notes, I always jot down the date and my initials at the end of each day. It helps me keep track of my experiments—there are so many records that it’s easy to get confused. I also note the time frame of each test, but that’s just for my own reference. I doubt Dominic will notice."

Dominic was no expert in fragrance creation. He excelled in securing investments, managing production, and marketing—skills that made him a capable executive. But when it came to the artistry of perfumery, he had neither the interest nor the expertise.

"That’s clever," Alexander conceded, finally understanding her confidence. Everyone had their own note-taking quirks, and while small, such details could be telling. Still, not everyone would catch them.

"Still…" He hesitated, not wanting to undermine her, but they had to consider every possibility. "What if he doesn’t use the original notes? He could have someone transcribe them. Then the handwriting won’t match yours, and your markings won’t be there."

Evelyn gave a small nod. "You’re right. But I have a way around that too. I’m confident I won’t lose this lawsuit."

Her unwavering determination left a deep impression on Alexander. He admired this side of her—the unshakable resolve. He loved this woman and trusted her completely.

The next day, as soon as Evelyn stepped into DR Holdings, she noticed the strange looks from her colleagues. She wondered if something was wrong with her appearance. Then she ran into Theodore Montgomery from HR, and the reason for the stares became clear.
###Chapter 50

Theo Montgomery summoned Evelyn Carter into his office the moment he spotted her. It was as if he had been anticipating her arrival.

He moved to the side of his desk and gestured toward the window blinds. "Close them."

Evelyn turned, obeying his command. As she did, she caught the curious, whispering gazes from outside. What’s happening? She tugged the blinds shut and stepped further into the room.

"Take a look at this." Theo retrieved an envelope and tossed it onto the desk in front of her.

Evelyn opened it with growing suspicion, her fingers brushing against the crisp paper inside—a lawyer’s letter. Just as she had expected, Dominic Reeves had filed a lawsuit against her. She skimmed the contents with a dismissive glance before slipping it back into the envelope, her lips curling into a cold smirk.

Theo had been watching her reaction closely. When he saw how unnervingly composed she remained, he couldn’t help but press, "What are your thoughts on this? They’ve served you with legal action."

Evelyn tucked the letter away. "I apologize for the trouble I’ve caused Phoenix Labs. But don’t worry—I’ll handle this. It won’t interfere with my work."

Theo exhaled sharply, frustration flickering in his eyes. From an HR standpoint, someone like Evelyn shouldn’t have been hired in the first place. Victoria Sterling had been harsh the other day, but she wasn’t entirely wrong.

Evelyn lacked both qualifications and reputation—and now, she was dragging legal trouble into the company. Yet, Gregory Whitmore had made his stance clear. Not only was Evelyn to be hired, but she was also to be protected. As an employee, Theo had no choice but to comply.

"For now, they’ve only sent you a letter. We don’t know if they’ll target Phoenix Labs next. Not that we’re afraid—we have our own legal team. But these things are best resolved quickly. Reputation matters. Do you understand?"

"Yes. I know I’ve caused complications. I truly apologize." Evelyn nodded, her voice steady.

Theo studied her for a long moment before sighing. "Go report to Ms. Sterling. She has something to discuss with you."

"Understood."

Just as Evelyn stood to leave, Theo called out again. "Ms. Sterling has a sharp tongue, but she’s competent. Don’t take anything she says personally."

"Noted."

The moment Evelyn opened the door, she felt the weight of dozens of eyes snapping away. Ignoring them, she strode toward the project department, her grip tightening around the envelope in her hand.

Meanwhile, in the CEO’s office at DR Holdings, Vanessa Blake hurled a pen across the room. "No! I refuse to keep doing this! Are you insane? I graduated years ago—why am I copying homework? And Evelyn’s homework, no less!"

Her furious glare burned into the notebook on the desk as if she could incinerate it with sheer will. A single book lay before her, but stacks upon stacks surrounded her—on the table, the floor, everywhere. The sight made her stomach churn. It was endless torture with no escape in sight.

Dominic, in contrast, remained infuriatingly calm. He plucked another pen from his desk and slid it toward her. "I know you’re exhausted. But this is for our future." His voice was low, deliberate. "You need to keep going."

Vanessa clenched her jaw, but Dominic’s unwavering gaze left no room for argument.
###Chapter 51

"Do I really have to transcribe all these notes manually? Why can't we just scan them? If handwritten copies are absolutely necessary, we could hire someone!" Vanessa whined, her lips forming a perfect pout as she voiced her complaints.

"I've been completely exhausted lately. My mental health is deteriorating under all this stress. Evelyn's constant attacks are wearing me down!" Vanessa clung to Dominic's arm, her voice dripping with honeyed sweetness.

Dominic's resolve melted instantly at Vanessa's coquettish display. He pulled her closer, wrapping an arm around her slender shoulders. "You know how this industry works, darling. Most lab notes are handwritten. Do you use computers during experiments? You only digitize the final reports, don't you?" He pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead.

But his reasoning did little to soothe Vanessa's irritation. "This is all Evelyn's fault. We would've won that award if she hadn't sabotaged us. The company wouldn't be struggling financially. We could've been expanding by now. Everything was going perfectly until she interfered!" Vanessa slammed the stack of notes onto the desk, imagining each page was Evelyn's face.

Dominic shared her fury, silently agreeing with every word. But strategic thinking prevailed - they needed concrete evidence to counter Evelyn's moves. Even with Celestia Group backing her, she'd be powerless against irrefutable proof.

After some coaxing, Vanessa reluctantly returned to her transcription task. Dominic stepped away to make a phone call once she'd calmed down. "Is everything prepared? Excellent. I've reviewed the manuscript - it's perfect. Publish it immediately." He added a few terse instructions before ending the call.

He moved to the floor-to-ceiling windows of their seventy-seventh floor office. Dominic had specifically chosen this floor when leasing the space - seven was his lucky number. Seven wonders of the world. Seven days of creation. He'd believed himself destined for greatness, blessed with fortune's favor. Until recently.

The startup phase had been challenging, but he'd overcome it effortlessly. Evelyn had created one bestselling fragrance after another, driving DR Holdings' meteoric rise.

Dominic's vision had been clear: secure the award, attract investors, expand production, double assets. Then take over the entire building, go public, establish international presence. His ambitions knew no bounds.

But someone had derailed his carefully laid plans. Evelyn's sudden transformation baffled him. She'd always been so compliant, working tirelessly without complaint, never questioning company decisions. So what if she'd discovered his affair with Vanessa?

She could have wept and pleaded for his attention. He would have happily provided for her indefinitely. What was wrong with a successful man having multiple women? Throughout history, powerful men always maintained harems. He only had two - why was Evelyn making such a fuss?

Dominic's heated breath fogged the glass, obscuring the glittering cityscape below. He wiped the condensation away with an angry swipe. He'd climbed too high to fall now. Returning to his humble beginnings was unthinkable. Impossible. He would never allow it. Never.
###Chapter 52

Evelyn Carter knew rejection was inevitable, but she hadn’t anticipated it would come so swiftly. The door to Victoria Sterling’s office was firmly shut, and her assistant blocked Evelyn’s path, informing her that only permanent staff were permitted inside. Thirty minutes of waiting made it clear—Victoria’s meeting wasn’t ending anytime soon.

Instead of lingering outside like a shadow, Evelyn pushed past the assistant and strode into the room.

The assistant gasped, scrambling after her. “Ms. Sterling, she—”

Victoria’s sharp gaze cut through the air. “Who gave you permission to enter?” Her voice was ice. “This is a private meeting. Get out.”

Evelyn didn’t flinch. “I’m permanent staff at Phoenix Labs now. That means I have every right to be here as part of this project.” She walked to an empty chair and sat, chin lifted.

Victoria’s lips curled in disdain. “Permanent or not, if I say you’re not fit for my team, you’re out.”

The tension thickened. Around the table, heads bowed, fingers fidgeting with papers—anything to avoid the brewing storm. They all knew the rumors about Evelyn Carter. Knew their boss despised her. Yet, by order of the director, she was here.

Why?

The unspoken question hung in the air.

Evelyn leaned forward. “Then tell me what I need to do to earn your approval. I’ll take any challenge.”

Victoria scoffed, amusement glinting in her eyes. “Words are easy. Can you back them up?”

Theo Montgomery had warned Evelyn—Victoria was blunt, quick-tempered, but not cruel. Better to face her head-on than dance around hidden daggers. Unlike Dominic Reeves and Vanessa Blake, who smiled while plotting, Victoria’s hostility was refreshingly honest.

Evelyn met her gaze. “Name your terms. If I succeed, I’m on the team. Deal?”

A slow, mocking smile spread across Victoria’s face. “And if you fail, you resign. Leave Phoenix Labs for good.”

Silence swallowed the room.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. “Deal.”
###Chapter 53

Victoria Sterling smirked when Evelyn Carter agreed without hesitation. Though Phoenix Labs was newly established under Celestia Group, its team consisted of the industry's finest. That was precisely why Victoria resented Evelyn's unorthodox hiring. Now, she finally had the perfect excuse to remove her from the team—and the company entirely.

"Don't you dare back out of our deal. I despise people who go back on their word," Victoria added sharply, fearing Evelyn might change her mind.

"Relax, I won’t. Just like you, I can’t stand dishonesty," Evelyn replied with a nod.

Victoria arched a brow and gestured toward the table. "Come here."

Evelyn rose and approached. The moment she entered, she noticed three identical fragrance bottles placed before Victoria. Their liquid levels matched perfectly—a telltale sign of product testing. In the fragrance industry, new lines underwent rigorous stability checks, and a perfumer’s expertise determined their success.

Evelyn waited silently as Victoria finally spoke. "These were rejected by the company. Tell me why they failed to meet standards." She tilted her chin toward the bottles. The others exchanged glances but stayed quiet, intrigued by the unfolding challenge.

Evelyn blinked, almost amused. That’s it?

Victoria ignored her reaction, reclining in her chair with a smug expectancy.

Without hesitation, Evelyn picked up the center bottle, studying its contents before moving to the next. She didn’t uncap them—just observed each one with deliberate focus. The room buzzed with silent judgment, their stares sharp with disdain.

News of Evelyn’s controversial hiring had spread. To them, she was a traitor—someone who’d betrayed her former employer’s secrets for a position at Phoenix Labs.

Evelyn ignored the hostility. Confidence was her armor now.

After a thorough inspection, she set the bottles back in place and met Victoria’s gaze.

Victoria sipped her tea, waiting for Evelyn to admit defeat. When no such confession came, she scoffed. "That’s it? You’re giving up already? Fine, I won’t humiliate you further—"

"Ms. Sterling, you must be joking," Evelyn interrupted, catching Victoria off guard.

Victoria’s lips parted mid-sentence.

"Why would the company reject these?" Evelyn continued smoothly. "They’re not failures—they’re the newly launched line, aren’t they? Released barely two weeks ago and already selling out."

A stunned silence followed.

Victoria’s smirk faltered.

Evelyn’s lips curved. "Unless, of course, this was never about the fragrances at all."
###Chapter 54

The room fell into stunned silence as Evelyn Carter stood her ground. Eyes darted between colleagues, suspicion hanging thick in the air about who might have betrayed company secrets to her.

Victoria Sterling studied Evelyn's composed expression with narrowed eyes. "These three fragrance lines—or should I say, variations of the same formula—each contain one unique ingredient differentiating them." Her manicured nail tapped against the glass bottles. "Subtle distinctions an untrained nose would miss, but seasoned perfume enthusiasts would eventually detect."

"Really?" Victoria's lips twisted in a mocking smile, attempting to undermine Evelyn's credibility.

Unshaken, Evelyn continued with quiet confidence. "Precisely. The rightmost formulation will outperform others among women aged eighteen to twenty-three."

A heavy silence blanketed the conference room. No one confirmed or denied her claim. The scent evaluators exchanged uneasy glances.

Victoria's gaze turned calculating. "You're certain?" Her voice dripped with condescension.

"Absolutely." Evelyn's steady nod sent a ripple through the observers. The disdain in Victoria's eyes morphed into something more complex—appraisal mixed with wariness.

"I recognize this as part of my evaluation." Evelyn's fingers hovered above the bottles. "If further proof is required, I can detail each ingredient's molecular structure and sourcing origin." Without waiting for permission, she began reciting the precise chemical compounds.

By the third ingredient listing, the room's atmosphere shifted palpably. Skeptical expressions gave way to reluctant respect. Even senior perfumers couldn't distinguish these nearly identical formulations without lab equipment, yet this supposedly disgraced newcomer identified them at a glance.

Victoria had orchestrated this public test intending to humiliate, but Evelyn transformed it into a masterclass. Discreet thumbs-up gestures flickered among junior staff as perceptions realigned.

Yet Evelyn's demeanor revealed no triumph. Her victory came too easily. Knowing Victoria's reputation for ruthless games, this couldn't be the endgame. "Impressive," Victoria conceded at last. "Your ingredient analysis matches our lab reports perfectly." A calculated pause. "Though I do wonder—how could you possibly know such specifics without even uncapping the bottles?" Her fingers brushed a stopper meaningfully. "Unless someone... tipped you off?"

The unspoken accusation hung like poisoned perfume in the air.

Evelyn's laugh rang clear as crystal. "Ms. Sterling, what an amusing theory. You designed this challenge spontaneously. Our wager wasn't premeditated." She swept her gaze across the rapt audience. "Unless someone here possesses clairvoyance?"

Murmurs of agreement rose from the team. Victoria's responding smile didn't reach her eyes. "Well then," she said slowly, "let's proceed."
###Chapter 55

"Alright, you've cleared the first hurdle," Victoria declared, crossing her arms.

Evelyn had anticipated this, yet she tilted her head slightly. "The first?"

Victoria smirked, her lips curling in amusement. "Did you honestly think it would be that simple? If you want a spot on my team, you play by my rules. Getting into DR Holdings isn't a walk in the park." Her tone sharpened as she leveled Evelyn with a piercing stare. "Every single person here fought tooth and nail through written exams and grueling interviews. What makes you think you can waltz in without proving yourself?"

That was the root of Victoria’s irritation. She had clawed her way up from the bottom—studying late into the night, surviving round after round of scrutiny before finally earning her place at Phoenix Labs. Now, as a senior manager, she prided herself on meritocracy. No shortcuts. No favors.

And then Evelyn Carter appeared, an anomaly wrapped in mystery.

Victoria didn’t care who Evelyn was or what strings she’d pulled with upper management. What mattered was competence. She refused to let an unqualified stranger drag her team down.

"I never claimed to be an exception," Evelyn replied smoothly, her voice calm, her smile unshaken. "Isn’t that why you’re testing me?"

There was no defensiveness, no insecurity—just quiet confidence. It was infuriating.

"Exactly. And passing one test doesn’t mean you’ve won me over," Victoria snapped.

The first challenge had been impulsive, a quick assessment. But Evelyn had handled it effortlessly, forcing Victoria to reconsider. Maybe she wasn’t just some entitled outsider.

Which meant Victoria needed to up the stakes.

"Ms. Sterling, feel free to make it harder. If I back down, consider it my loss." Evelyn’s gaze never wavered. Then, with deliberate grace, she stepped closer.

Victoria stiffened. There was something unsettling about that smile—not threatening, but… calculating. "What now?"

"Just curious," Evelyn mused. "How many rounds are we playing?"

Victoria bristled. "Suddenly having second thoughts? Weren’t you just boasting about taking on anything?"

"It’s not fear," Evelyn clarified. "But if this is a wager, shouldn’t we agree on the terms? I don’t mind challenges—as long as they’re fair. What I do mind is an endless gauntlet with no finish line."

Victoria’s hands clenched into fists. "Are you implying I’d rig this against you?"

Evelyn’s smile deepened. "Not at all. I trust you’re a woman of integrity. So, how many tests stand between me and your approval?"

The question hung in the air, sharp as a blade.

Victoria’s jaw tightened. She wouldn’t lose her composure. Not here. Not to her.

But damn if Evelyn Carter didn’t know how to push her buttons.
###Chapter 56

Evelyn Carter might have seemed soft-spoken and easy to push around, but every word she had just uttered carried a sharp edge. Vanessa Blake had intended to make her life difficult, but after being called out so bluntly, she couldn’t follow through.

"Three challenges!" Vanessa bit her lip, her voice rising. "Everyone who joined my project had to go through three trials. You’re no exception."

Evelyn straightened her posture and nodded firmly. "Fine. If everyone else did it, I will too. But I’d like to know—what’s the second challenge? Or was the first one just a warm-up?"

Her tone was innocent, as if she genuinely wanted to understand the rules. In reality, she was ensuring Vanessa couldn’t suddenly change them. Vanessa had considered labeling the previous test as a trial run, but Evelyn’s pointed remark forced her to abandon the idea.

"I already said you passed the first challenge. No one would call it a warm-up. What kind of company do you think we are?" Vanessa snapped, irritation flashing in her eyes.

"Of course, I believe in our company’s integrity!" Evelyn replied brightly.

"Enough with the flattery. It won’t work on me," Vanessa cut in sharply. "Don’t forget—you still have two challenges left, and they’ll only get harder. Don’t come crying to me when you fail."

Evelyn smirked. "Don’t worry. Unlike some people, I honor my word."

The deliberate emphasis on honor made Vanessa’s expression darken.

"Meeting adjourned!" Vanessa declared, and the room emptied instantly as everyone scrambled to leave.

Evelyn knew this wasn’t over. She waited outside the door.

The moment the last person disappeared, Vanessa stood and strode toward her. "You got lucky today. The next two challenges won’t be so easy. And don’t think you can outsmart me."

"So they’re not happening today?" Evelyn asked, reading between the lines.

Vanessa scoffed. "Do I look like I have nothing better to do than design challenges for you? I need time to prepare."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Then when will the next one be?" If Vanessa dragged this out indefinitely, it would be the same as refusing her entry.

Vanessa smirked. "Worried I’ll delay forever?"

"Absolutely," Evelyn shot back without hesitation.

Vanessa blinked, momentarily caught off guard by her honesty. Then she chuckled. "Fine. Since you’re being direct, I’ll return the favor. I’d love to drag this out, but I’m not that petty. Give me three days. I’ll have the next challenge ready."

Evelyn nodded. "And what do I do in the meantime?"
###Chapter 57

"Work?" Victoria Sterling shook her head. "You're not officially part of the team yet, Evelyn. You haven't passed my evaluation."

She paused, her gaze sharp. "So, I won't assign you any tasks."

Evelyn Carter crossed her arms. "If you're suggesting I do menial chores instead, the answer is no."

"I'm a perfumer," Evelyn continued, her voice firm. "I know my worth and my role. Cleaning isn't beneath me, but it's not what I was hired for."

Victoria's lips thinned. She had expected Evelyn to grovel, to prove herself by doing whatever was asked. Instead, the woman stood her ground.

"Fine," Victoria said coolly. "You have three days. If I don't devise an assessment by then, consider yourself approved."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Perfect. I'll be waiting for your call, Ms. Sterling."

With that, she turned and walked out, leaving whispers in her wake. The others in the office exchanged glances—had Evelyn just been fired? Or had she walked out on her own?

Evelyn didn’t care. She had bigger problems to solve.

The moment she slid into her car, her phone rang. An unknown number.

"Hello, is this Ms. Carter? Evelyn Carter?" The voice was polite but unfamiliar.

Evelyn frowned. "Yes. Who is this?"

"I represent DR Holdings. Mr. Reeves has assigned me to handle your case regarding the alleged theft of confidential information."

Evelyn nearly laughed. Theft?

Dominic had been careful with his words before. Now, he was outright calling her a criminal.

"Ms. Carter," the lawyer continued smoothly, "the evidence is stacked against you. You have two options: settle privately or publicly."

"And what does private settlement entail?" Evelyn asked, twisting open a bottle of water.

"A written apology, prepared by us. You sign it. Then, a week of public apologies—to Mr. Reeves and Ms. Blake. Oh, and you’re barred from the industry for three years."

Evelyn took a slow sip. "And the public option?"

"We go to court."

She recapped the bottle with a sharp click.

"Court it is."
###Chapter 58

Vanessa Blake didn't anticipate Evelyn Carter would choose the impossible option without a second thought. She froze for a moment before quickly adding, "Ms. Carter, I don’t think you fully grasp the severity of this. You’re underestimating the consequences. If you lose, it won’t just be an apology—you’ll face crippling damages and possible imprisonment. That’s why I strongly advise reconsidering. Mr. Reeves is only asking for a public apology—"

"Tell Dominic to wake up before he turns into a complete fool!" Evelyn cut her off sharply. "You keep saying if I lose, but I have no intention of losing. See you in court."

With that, she ended the call. The audacity! Did Dominic really believe he could destroy her with fabricated evidence and bought witnesses?

She had stayed in the shadows for years, willingly letting him use her as a stepping stone. But not anymore. Never again would she be that weak, pitiful version of herself.

Evelyn drove straight home, surprised to find Alexander Kensington already there. She had assumed he’d still be at Celestia Group.

He had clearly just arrived—his suit jacket and tie discarded, his crisp white shirt unbuttoned at the top, revealing the sharp line of his collarbone. He lounged on the sofa, tablet in hand, his brows furrowed as he scrolled through something on the screen.

"You’re home early," she remarked, slipping off her heels at the entrance. "Have you eaten? I can make something."

She moved toward the kitchen, but Alexander caught her wrist, pulling her back. "Not yet. Come here."

Evelyn turned, studying his expression. She’d already rolled up her sleeves, but the tension in his jaw made her pause. "What’s wrong? Trouble at the company?"

"Do you really think there’s a problem I can’t handle?" His gaze flicked up, irritation flashing in his eyes.

Since taking over Celestia Group, he’d faced countless challenges—none of which had broken him. Money, influence, sheer will—he had all of it. Evelyn bit back a smile and settled beside him, looping her arms around his neck.

"Of course not. My brilliant CEO can conquer anything," she teased.

The proximity sent a spark through the air. Alexander’s eyes darkened as he leaned in, his breath warm against her lips. "Brilliant, hm? How brilliant?"

Evelyn’s cheeks flushed. "H-How should I know?" She tried to push him away, but he caught her waist, pulling her flush against him.

"You started this," he murmured, his voice low. "Should I prove it?"

Her pulse jumped. There was no escaping now—not when he held her like this.

"Is your… inconvenience over?" he asked, the implication clear.

Evelyn wished she could vanish into the couch. It was broad daylight. "N-Not yet," she stammered.

His quiet sigh made her face burn hotter. "What were you reading?" she asked, desperate to shift focus.

"Nothing important," he said dismissively, moving to set the tablet aside—but Evelyn had already glimpsed the headline on the screen.
###Chapter 59

The tablet screen displayed Twitter, flashing with breaking news. Evelyn immediately recognized the trending vlogger known for sensational entertainment stories.

She arched an eyebrow. "I never took you for someone who followed celebrity gossip, Alexander." Her voice carried playful disbelief.

Alexander remained silent, his gaze intense. That look sent a chill down Evelyn's spine. She turned back to the screen, leaning closer. The article wasn't about some celebrity - it was about her.

The piece chronicled her college years through her professional career, carefully omitting her name. The most detailed section focused on her past with Dominic and Vanessa.

The headline screamed: "Happy Hour With the Wolf in Sheep's Clothing."

What the hell?

Evelyn's breath caught. More than anger, she felt shock. She'd thought Dominic had exhausted all his dirty tricks with the lawsuit. Apparently, he still had cards to play. Now he was rewriting history, denying they'd ever had feelings for each other.

N?velDrama.Org owns all content.

"I..." Evelyn swallowed hard, turning to Alexander. "Do you believe any of this?"

Other people's opinions didn't matter. Only Alexander's did.

His expression remained unreadable. "Believe what?" he asked calmly.

"Just some tabloid nonsense." He powered off the tablet, pulling her into his arms. His fingers gently pinched her nose. "Are you upset?"

Evelyn shook her head, wrapping her arms around his neck. She buried her face in his shoulder, breathing in his familiar scent. His steady presence anchored her.

What a ridiculous question she'd asked. If Alexander believed that trash, he wouldn't be holding her like this. His unconditional trust felt foreign yet comforting.

The more time she spent with him, the clearer it became what a real man looked like. Meanwhile, reflecting on her past with Dominic only reinforced how toxic that relationship had been.

"You called it nonsense yourself. Why would I be upset over nonsense?" She mumbled against his shoulder.

"Good." Alexander stroked her hair, twirling a strand around his finger. "Did you skip work today because you were upset?" His tone turned conversational. "Anyone at Phoenix Labs giving you trouble?"

"Not at all. Victoria's been incredibly understanding. She gave me three days to settle personal matters and adjust to the new environment." Evelyn clapped her hands in appreciation. "She's amazing."

"Is that so?" Alexander's gaze sharpened.

"Such a thoughtful manager. I should make time to... properly thank her."

His expression turned serious - no trace of humor remained.
###Chapter 60

Evelyn waved her hands frantically. "No need. Phoenix Labs is just a small subsidiary of the Celestia Group, and our director reports directly to me. It's nothing compared to a high-ranking CEO like you. Don't scare people like that when you meet them."

"Hey..." Alexander chuckled, rubbing his chin. "This flattery is good. I might just reward you for it."

Her eyes lit up with curiosity. "What kind of reward?"

"What do you want?" He stepped closer, his breath brushing against her ear.

A shiver ran down Evelyn's spine. She jumped back, putting distance between them. "I'll have to think about it! Let's eat first—I'm starving!"

Alexander watched her dart into the kitchen, amusement flickering in his gaze. He didn’t stop her. Instead, his smile faded as his attention returned to the tablet in his hands. His expression darkened, a storm brewing in his eyes.

Even if it was just nonsense, any woman who dared to provoke him like this would regret it.

In the kitchen, Evelyn washed her hands and opened the refrigerator. She had expected bare essentials—instant noodles, maybe some eggs—but was surprised to find it fully stocked with fresh meat, vegetables, and even pre-packaged broth bones.

She had assumed a man like Alexander wouldn’t bother with groceries. The housekeepers only came every other day to clean, so how had he managed to keep so much food stocked?

After surveying the ingredients, she decided to cook first and ask him later.

The past few weeks had been hectic with the Eternal Bloom project, leaving little time for proper meals. Alexander had taken her out to dinner twice, but nothing compared to home-cooked food.

The broth bones made things easier. After blanching them to remove impurities, she set them to simmer. A few eggs and some garnish later, dinner would be ready.

Alexander finished a few tasks before rising from his seat. The rich aroma of cooking food lured him toward the kitchen.

Evelyn stood at the stove, spatula in hand, stirring vegetables while checking the soup. The oversized apron wrapped around her slender frame made her look even smaller.

Beautiful.

He leaned against the doorframe, watching silently.

Then, before he could stop himself, he strode forward and took the spatula from her hand.

"Whoa!" Evelyn startled, nearly dropping the utensil. His reflexes were quick—one hand steadied her waist while the other kept a firm grip on the spatula.

A second later, he took over.

"You're cooking?" she asked, bewildered.

Alexander deftly avoided her attempt to reclaim the utensil, nudging her gently out of the way. "Go sit. I've got this."

His tone left no room for argument. Evelyn hesitated, but after watching him handle the dish with surprising skill, she relented.

"Go!" he barked when she lingered.

With nothing left to do, Evelyn stepped back—just in time to see him reach for the salt.
###Chapter 61

After drying her hands, Evelyn returned to the living room and settled onto the sofa, taking a slow sip of water.

Her gaze drifted toward the tablet resting on the side table. After a brief hesitation, she picked it up and powered it on.

The Twitter interface loaded, and she pressed her knuckles to her lips, scanning the breaking news with narrowed eyes. She didn’t need to read much—given her connection to Alexander, she already knew the gist. The headlines were undoubtedly about her, Dominic, and Vanessa back in their college days.

The tweets were twisted, fragments of truth stretched into outright lies.

But what intrigued her more was the source. It wasn’t Dominic or Vanessa fueling the fire. Instead, it was a third party—some so-called "mutual friends" or former classmates who had suddenly found their voices.

At first, irritation prickled under her skin. But as she scrolled further, amusement replaced anger. The names were vaguely familiar, faces she could barely recall.

Evelyn had never been one for excessive socializing. Between endless experiments and data collection, she hadn’t wasted time on meaningless connections. Yet these strangers spoke as if they knew her intimately.

They painted Vanessa and Dominic as the perfect college sweethearts, destined for each other, while Evelyn was cast as the scheming interloper. According to them, she had weaseled her way into their relationship, and out of sheer kindness, they had tolerated her presence.

Even now, they claimed, Dominic had taken her in during her darkest days—only for her to repay him with betrayal, stealing company secrets and sabotaging Vanessa’s hard work.

The Ungrateful Woman, indeed.

Evelyn exhaled, shaking her head. The absurdity of it all was almost entertaining. She wasn’t the villain they described, and their fabricated drama held no weight.

"Dinner’s ready."

The rich aroma of food filled the air as Alexander emerged from the kitchen, setting a steaming bowl of soup on the table. He glanced at her, then turned back to fetch the rest.

She moved to help, but his sharp look stopped her. "Sit. Don’t touch anything."

Obediently, she took her seat, watching as he arranged everything with practiced ease. He even portioned her meal before her, his movements precise.

If anyone from Celestia Group saw him like this—domestic, attentive—they’d probably faint from shock. The formidable Alexander Kensington, reduced to a doting chef.

"Eat," he said, sliding the fork and spoon into her hands. After a pause, he retrieved the soup and placed it in front of her before finally sitting down.

"I’m not used to being spoiled like this," Evelyn mused, resting her chin on her palm.

Alexander arched a brow. "If you think this is spoiling, you’re in for a surprise."

Her pulse stuttered at the promise in his tone. This man was dangerously charming.

The spread before her was impressive—roasted vegetables, golden potatoes, the mac and cheese she’d made earlier, and the rich chicken noodle soup. Alexander nudged more greens onto her plate. "You’re too thin. Eat."

"I didn’t know you could cook," she admitted, savoring a bite. The flavors were vibrant, the presentation flawless. It rivaled any five-star restaurant.

Alexander merely smirked. "There’s a lot you don’t know about me."

And Evelyn found herself eager to learn every last detail.
###Chapter 62

Alexander set down his spoon and fixed Evelyn with an intense gaze. "Do I look like a helpless child who needs to be spoon-fed? Should I wait for staff to wipe my mouth too?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her soup, the mental image striking her as absurd. "Honestly!"

While his comparison was exaggerated, it wasn't entirely off-base. "At the very least, someone of your standing shouldn't be cooking," she mused, curiosity sparking. His lifestyle clearly defied her expectations.

"Given the choice? I wouldn't," Alexander admitted without hesitation. With his position as heir to Celestia Group and the Kensington family, mundane tasks were beneath him.

"Then why insist on cooking tonight?" Evelyn pressed. Was it a secret passion? Why else would he shove her out of his state-of-the-art kitchen?

Alexander's lips quirked as he wiped his hands. "I spent years abroad for training."

"And?" Evelyn tilted her head, not following. Even overseas, the Kensingtons could've easily provided staff. Unless...he disliked having servants invade his privacy?

He sipped his wine before answering. "As future CEO, my education extended beyond boardrooms. Cooking was...a necessary skill. Consider it stress relief." His tone darkened slightly, hinting at unspoken struggles during those years—years he'd spent away from her.

"So you took over because you doubted my cooking?" Evelyn challenged, though she couldn't deny his soup was exceptional.

"The ventilation was inadequate," he stated flatly. Then, softer: "You'll never need to cook again."

Evelyn's breath caught.

Inadequate ventilation? His kitchen had industrial-grade exhaust systems. Compared to her old apartment's tiny stove, this space was a chef's dream.

Then she remembered his words from weeks prior: "A woman belongs everywhere—especially my Evelyn." She'd swelled with pride, imagining him relying on her domestic skills. Back then, Alexander only ate pre-prepared meals, never lifting a finger.

Yet tonight, he'd barred her from cooking over ventilation?

The realization struck like lightning: a man who truly cherished his woman wouldn't relegate her to chores. He'd shield her from hardship, just as Alexander had—protecting her hands, her comfort, her very presence in his world.
###Chapter 63

The moment dinner ended, Evelyn rose to clear the dishes, but Alexander caught her wrist. "Stay right where you are," he commanded, his voice firm. His disapproving frown deepened. "The kitchen is off-limits. You're not stepping foot in there again."

Evelyn sighed in exasperation. "I've always cooked for myself before, so—"

"That was then," Alexander cut in sharply. "From now on, you don’t." He efficiently gathered the dishes and strode into the kitchen. The sound of running water soon filled the air as Evelyn lingered in the doorway, watching him. His sleeves were rolled up, revealing toned forearms, his skin fair but not pallid—strong, masculine. The memory of those hands gripping her waist sent an involuntary shiver down her spine.

"Are you going to respond?" Alexander asked without turning, his hands submerged in soapy water.

Evelyn blinked, momentarily thrown. "Huh? To what?"

"Those ridiculous Twitter rumors," he clarified, glancing over his shoulder.

After a brief pause, Evelyn nodded. "Absolutely." Though the accusations were baseless, they still tarnished her reputation. Worse, they reflected on Alexander. She refused to let him be dragged into this mess.

"How do you plan to handle it? A public statement?"

She shook her head. "Denying it outright will only fuel the fire. They want me to engage—to give them more ammunition."

The public would assume her silence meant guilt. A few might believe her, but what did that matter? Time, reputation—both would be casualties. How could she face her colleagues at Celestia Group after this?

As for Dominic and Vanessa, they didn’t need to lift a finger. They could simply pay others to do their dirty work while staying clean. Evelyn had no intention of playing their game.

"Then… do you need my help?" Alexander finished washing up, drying his hands meticulously before turning to face her.

Evelyn stepped forward as he opened his arms, meeting his embrace willingly. She tilted her head up, meeting his gaze. "If I can’t handle this, what kind of wife would I be for Mr. Kensington?"

A slow smile curved Alexander’s lips. He dipped his head, pressing a soft kiss to her forehead. "You’re the only woman in the world qualified to be my wife." Whether it was flattery or truth, Evelyn accepted it with a pleased hum.

In return, she rose onto her toes, brushing her lips against his. What was meant to be a quick peck quickly escalated—Alexander’s hand cradled the back of her head, his kiss deepening, demanding more.

Meanwhile, Dominic had just wrapped up a meeting in DR Holdings’ executive office. He was adjusting his tie smugly when he spotted Sebastian waiting outside. "Well?" he asked, unable to suppress his triumphant grin.

"Ms. Carter declined the settlement offer," Sebastian reported. "She intends to take you to court."

Dominic froze mid-reach for his coffee. His fingers twitched as if stung. "What did you just say?"

"She refused to negotiate privately. She’s prepared for litigation."

Dominic’s smirk faltered. His eyes narrowed. "Does she really think she can win? What new evidence could she possibly have?"
###Chapter 64

Sebastian shook his head. "I can't be certain, but Ms. Carter's tone was unshakable."

He leaned forward, resting his elbows on the desk. "With the evidence we've gathered, victory is practically guaranteed. You really shouldn't worry so much, Mr. Reeves."

Yet Dominic remained visibly agitated. How could he not?

Sebastian wasn't concerned because he only saw the surface-level proof. Dominic, however, knew the truth—DR Holdings' success over the years was built on Evelyn's relentless efforts. Why was she suddenly so resolute? So final?

Dominic felt trapped. If he couldn't reverse this situation, every employee at DR Holdings would be dragged into a brutal, endless battle.

Evelyn had to know she stood no chance. So why wouldn't she back down? Did Phoenix Labs give her this confidence, or was she hiding something? The uncertainty gnawed at him.

"Understood. When does the trial begin?"

"Next week."

"Prepare thoroughly. And keep trying to reach Evelyn. Tell her... we can settle this privately. For old times' sake. Be subtle about it. Do you understand?"

"Yes, but—" Sebastian hesitated.

"That's all." Dominic dismissed him with a wave.

Sebastian left, confusion lingering in his expression.

The door barely closed before Vanessa strode in—no knock, as usual. Everyone knew that while Vanessa technically headed R&D, her real title was "the CEO's fiancée."

Outside, whispers erupted the moment the door shut.

"Did you see the latest headlines? About our CEO and his so-called fiancée?"

"Who even is his real fiancée?"

"Come on, it's obviously Vanessa. Who else?"

"I read the article. Some homewrecker tried to break them up after years together. Then she stole company secrets on her way out. That technician—what's her name—"

"Evelyn!"

"Right, Evelyn! She seemed so sweet too. Who would've guessed?"

"I once saw her getting cozy with Mr. Reeves. Never thought it'd escalate like this."

"Cozy? Try engaged. I overheard them setting a date to get married."

"What?! Spill everything! Is this why everything's blowing up now?"

The office WhatsApp group buzzed nonstop. Employees typed furiously, thrilled by the drama unfolding right in front of them.

Inside the office, Vanessa glanced through the blinds at the whispering crowd. Their stares prickled her skin. With an irritated flick, she yanked the blinds shut.

Pathetic nobodies.

"Nate," she purred, draping herself over Dominic's shoulder, "you've been neglecting me. I'm suffocating here."

"You want to go out?" He drained his coffee in one gulp. "Do you not realize what's happening? Evelyn is taking us to court."
###Chapter 65

"Let's fight then," Vanessa said with a dismissive wave. "We have all the evidence we need—I've already copied everything. Plus, we have the best legal team money can buy. Why should we be afraid of her?"

She lifted her hand, examining it with a dramatic sigh. "Look at this—my fingers are swollen and aching! I wouldn’t have had to work this hard if it weren’t for Evelyn. Dominic, we can’t let her win. You have to teach her a lesson this time. How dare she treat you like this?"

Dominic pushed her away when she leaned in, his expression grim. He wasn’t as confident as she was. "Something doesn’t feel right. Why would she insist on going to court when she knows we have all the evidence?"

Vanessa froze for a second, then shook her head.

"Impossible. You’re overthinking it. What could Evelyn possibly do? We have the data, and none of the other employees even know her. I made sure of that—kept her locked away in the lab, never let her mingle at headquarters. And now, the whole internet thinks she’s the jealous mistress who stole company secrets to get back at me. What’s there to worry about? We’ve got this in the bag!"

Dominic exhaled sharply. "It’s not that simple. You know she was the one behind all of DR Holdings’ successful products."

Vanessa’s eyes flashed with irritation. "Oh, so you do still care about her? If you like her so much, go running back to her. I’ll leave. Right now!"

Seeing her pout, Dominic pulled her into his arms. "Don’t be ridiculous. That’s not what I meant. If I wanted her, would I be in this mess? Everything I’ve done—it’s all for you, my little troublemaker."

He pressed soft kisses along her jawline until she melted against him. When they finally pulled apart, Vanessa sighed dramatically. "I hate it when you talk about her. She had you wrapped around her finger for years. Of course I’m jealous!"

Dominic chuckled. "I know, I know. But right now, we have bigger problems. Vanessa, since Eternal Bloom, we haven’t released anything groundbreaking. The board is getting restless. You’re the head of R&D—we need something fresh, something spectacular."

Vanessa hesitated.

It wasn’t that she didn’t have the knowledge—she just hadn’t used it in years. Evelyn had done all the real work while she played the charming executive. Sure, she understood the basics, but perfume-making required instinct, inspiration, genius. And right now, all her energy was spent scheming—how to keep Dominic, how to secure her place as the future Mrs. Reeves, how to live the lavish life she deserved.

She huffed. "Don’t pressure me!"

Dominic wrapped his arms around her from behind. "I’m not pressuring you. But I’m under pressure too. Think about it—if we debut a new hit at the Paris exhibition, we won’t even need to fight this lawsuit. We’ll crush Evelyn effortlessly. And afterward? We’ll take a long vacation, get married, honeymoon across Europe… What do you say?"

Vanessa could almost picture it—the fame, the luxury, the victory.

But reality crashed back in.

Creating a bestseller wasn’t that easy. She was rusty. Out of practice. Even if an idea struck her, could she actually execute it?

Dominic sensed her hesitation. "What’s wrong? Losing confidence?" He kissed her temple. "You’re not alone. You’ve got the whole lab at your disposal—including Isabella. She worked with Evelyn for years. She knows the tricks. Use her."

Vanessa bit her lip.

Maybe… just maybe… she could pull this off.
###Chapter 66

Evelyn's thoughts spun wildly as Dominic made his demand. Was there truly no other way out of this?

Though no brilliant solution came to mind, she could only nod in reluctant agreement under his persistent pressure. "Alright, I'll do my best."

"I knew I could count on you!" Dominic beamed, his satisfaction evident. "As for Vanessa, I plan to confront her again. I need to know what tricks she's hiding up her sleeve."

Perched by the café window, Vanessa idly swiped through her phone while delicately slicing into a mille-feuille with her spoon.

The door burst open. Sophia stormed in, scanning the room before zeroing in on Vanessa's table. "Espresso and a chocolate éclair," she snapped at the waiter before dropping into her seat with a dramatic sigh.

"Did someone set your hair on fire?" Vanessa teased, raising an amused brow.

"Don't even joke about that!" Sophia huffed, her scowl deepening when Vanessa laughed.

Vanessa reached out, pinching Sophia's cheek playfully. "Has Dominic been giving you trouble again?"

"That snake!" Sophia's rage ignited at the mention of him. "He ordered me to be Vanessa's assistant—helping her develop new products! Can you believe the audacity?" Her voice rose with each word. "Vanessa, of all people! What does that airhead know about real craftsmanship?"

Vanessa chuckled, stirring her tea. "Come now, she's certified. And she has awards to her name."

"Awards?" Sophia scoffed. "Stolen glory, more like! First, she took your work, then your man, and now she's dragging your reputation through the mud. How does someone like that sleep at night? I swear, I'm this close to—"

"Shh." Vanessa pressed a finger to her lips, glancing around. "He hasn't been 'my man' for a long time."

"How can you stay so calm? Have you seen what they're saying online? I've been arguing with them all morning—until they deleted my comments, the cowards!"

"You—you actually argued with them?" Vanessa blinked, surprised. She hadn't checked the latest posts yet.

Dominic must have hired a team to scrub the forums clean.

The lengths he'd go to protect his precious Vanessa.
###Chapter 67

Sophia turned to Evelyn with concern in her eyes. "Evelyn, what are you planning to do? They're tearing you apart like this. Even some of your old classmates have joined in. It's unbelievable—they were your peers! Even if they weren't close to you, how could they spread such lies?"

Evelyn sighed, stirring her coffee absently. "You can't blame them. I wasn't exactly social back then. Most of them probably never knew about Dominic and me."

She had to be honest about it. The truth was, she and Dominic had only officially gotten together after graduation—after he confessed to her when she won her first major award.

Later, when everything fell apart, he had stayed by her side. Maybe it was gratitude that made her fall for him, or maybe something deeper. Either way, Evelyn had thrown herself into their relationship, content to stay in the background while he shone. She had lived for the lab, for him, for nothing else.

Looking back now, with a clearer mind, it all felt like a carefully laid trap.

"Is that really how it was?" Sophia frowned, tapping her spoon against her cup. "Then... is there anyone else who knew about you two? Besides me, besides the three of you—any mutual friends?"

Evelyn shook her head.

"Even if there were, I wouldn't drag them into this. It would only make things worse."

"So you're just going to let them win?" Sophia clenched her fists, frustration burning in her chest.

People were destroying Evelyn's reputation, and she couldn't even defend herself. How was that fair?

"Don't you think everyone's focusing on the wrong thing?" Evelyn took a slow sip of coffee, her voice steady. "Between DR Holdings and me, the real issue is the ownership of Eternal Bloom. My past with Dominic is personal—it shouldn't be public gossip. So why is he exposing it now? Just to go public with Vanessa?"

Sophia's eyes widened as realization struck. She slammed her palm on the table. "I get it! He's using the scandal to distract everyone from the copyright dispute!"

Evelyn chuckled, glancing out the window at the bright sunlight. She had spent too long buried in the lab—she'd almost forgotten how beautiful the world could be.

"No," she said softly. "It's worse than that. Vanessa and Dominic are smearing my name to shape public opinion. They want people to see me as the kind of woman who steals other people's relationships—and other people's work."

Her voice was calm, but the words cut deep.

"They want everyone to believe I'm jealous of Vanessa—that I'm not as talented, not as successful, so I'm trying to take what's hers. And since I'm the 'other woman,' who would question it? No evidence needed."

Sophia stared at her, stunned. "That's... ruthless."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Just petty tactics. But none of it matters. If I win this lawsuit, the truth will come out. Everything else is just noise."

At first, Sophia had thought this would be complicated, but Evelyn made it sound so simple. Still, she couldn't help but worry.

"But the evidence—"

"Evidence exists whether they like it or not," Evelyn interrupted. "Dominic thinks he has everything because he took my notes, my research. But the most important proof?" She tapped her temple. "He can't take this away."
###Chapter 68

After her meeting with Isabella, Evelyn Carter intended to head straight home, but her phone buzzed with an unexpected call. The number wasn’t saved in her contacts, and for a brief moment, she hesitated before recognizing the sharp, clipped tone on the other end.

Victoria Sterling.

Evelyn hadn’t expected to hear from her so soon.

"The second and third trials are prepped. Are you ready?" Victoria’s voice was direct, almost challenging.

Evelyn considered it for a beat. "When?"

"What, not eager enough? Can you handle it now?" There was a taunting edge to Victoria’s words, but Evelyn wasn’t one to back down from a dare. She preferred challenges thrown in her face over knives in the dark.

Glancing at the time, she replied, "Fine. I’ll be there in twenty."

She had asked for the timing because of the looming court date next week, but if Victoria wanted to rush this, then so be it. Whatever was coming, Evelyn would meet it head-on.

Victoria sent an address—somewhere remote, far from the usual bustle of the city. Frowning, Evelyn forwarded the location to Alexander Kensington.

At that exact moment, Alexander was in the middle of a board meeting when his phone lit up with her name. Without hesitation, he picked it up, ignoring the curious glances from the executives around the table.

"What’s the matter?" he typed back swiftly.

Evelyn, unaware he was occupied, sent a voice message instead. "Do you know this place?"

Alexander exhaled sharply, then tapped his pen against the table. "Carry on without me," he instructed his VP before striding out of the room.

In the empty office next door, he played her message. Her voice was clear, bright—she was outside, probably already on her way.

He pulled up the address, zooming in on the map with two fingers. Recognition flickered in his gaze. "That’s one of DR Holdings’ subsidiaries. Why are you going there?"

Of course, he’d already guessed before she even explained.

Evelyn had made the right call asking him. But why would Victoria send her to a subsidiary now? Just days ago, she’d been adamant about keeping Evelyn out of the project division. Had something changed?

"Got it. Thanks!" Evelyn replied cheerfully before hailing a cab.

If Alexander said the location was safe, then she had nothing to worry about.

Time to see what Victoria had in store for her.
###Chapter 69

Laboratories were typically situated far from bustling city centers.

The reasons were practical.

First, they required expansive spaces that came cheaper in suburban areas.

Second, researchers needed undisturbed environments for precise experiments.

Additionally, sourcing raw materials proved easier outside urban congestion.

During Evelyn's tenure at DR Holdings, their facility had also occupied the city's outskirts.

But Dominic's limited budget only afforded half of a rundown factory building.

She remembered how he'd personally handled raw material procurement back then.

Dominic would always beam with pride at their finished products, spinning dreams of their future together.

Empty promises, all of them.

The address Victoria had provided was remote, yet accessible by cab.

What greeted Evelyn wasn't the expected factory, but an entire office tower.

While architecturally unremarkable, its presence in this desolate area surprised her.

"Ms. Sterling, I've arrived," Evelyn announced, standing before the secured entrance.

The building boasted tight security - guards and electronic access systems.

This was clearly Phoenix Labs' headquarters.

"Five minutes," came Victoria's clipped response before the line went dead.

Evelyn surveyed the barren surroundings.

Few residences dotted the landscape.

This was nothing like the makeshift lab she'd worked in with Dominic.

But backed by the mighty Celestia Group, Phoenix Labs would never settle for such ramshackle quarters.

Their old factory could've been mistaken for an auto parts workshop.

True to her word, Victoria emerged five minutes later.

Gone was the polished executive - now she wore a lab coat with hair tucked under a surgical cap.

After swiping her access card, Victoria fixed Evelyn with an icy stare.

"Follow me. Speak only when spoken to. Understood?"

Evelyn nodded. "Understood."

The elevator ascended to the seventh floor.

An attendant immediately provided Evelyn with protective gear - coat, cap, and shoe covers.

She donned them efficiently, completing the required sanitation protocol.

The unscented disinfectant soap confirmed this was indeed a perfumery lab.

While perfumers didn't require hospital-level sterility, basic hygiene standards were mandatory.

But upon entering, Evelyn realized this was no ordinary laboratory.

The overwhelming stench assaulted her senses, triggering her gag reflex.

She fought to keep her stomach contents down as her eyes watered.

Victoria showed no reaction to the foul odor.

Instead, she watched Evelyn's struggle with grim satisfaction.

"Ms. Sterling...is this my second test?" Evelyn guessed between controlled breaths.

Victoria's lips curled slightly. "Does it frighten you?"
###Chapter 70

There was no hostility in Victoria Sterling’s gaze this time. Instead, it carried something akin to encouragement.

A faint smile curved her lips. "Why would I be afraid?"

Evelyn Carter, as a perfumer, understood that the craft wasn’t just about creating captivating scents—it also involved taming the most repulsive odors.

Not all raw materials carried pleasant aromas. Some reeked, some were downright nauseating. To neutralize the stench while preserving the desired fragrance, a perfumer had to master the unique properties of each element.

The overwhelming stench in this lab suggested it was dedicated to experimenting with the most pungent odors imaginable.

Evelyn had expected Victoria to challenge her, but she hadn’t anticipated this method.

Still, it didn’t matter. In fact, it intrigued her. Evelyn was fascinated by every aspect of perfumery, no matter how unpleasant.

Victoria was mildly impressed by Evelyn’s composure but kept her tone sharp. "Don’t get too confident. Do you think simply eliminating the smell is enough? That’s basic knowledge any novice perfumer should have."

She crossed her arms. "Your task is to document the data of forty-eight distinct odors and analyze their characteristics. You have three days. Can you handle it?"

Evelyn met her gaze steadily. "I don’t need that long."

She paused, then added, "One day. That’s all I need."

A flicker of surprise crossed Victoria’s face before she masked it. "Fine. You asked for it. Don’t blame me if you fail. You’ll take full responsibility for your promise."

"Of course." Evelyn was already eager to begin.

Seeing the excitement in Evelyn’s eyes, Victoria found herself inexplicably curious about the outcome.

Truthfully, Victoria hadn’t liked Evelyn from the start. She had been skeptical when Gregory Whitmore insisted on hiring her, suspecting there was more to the story.

But Evelyn’s performance in the meeting had shifted Victoria’s perspective slightly. At the very least, the woman had real skill.

Why had she never heard of Evelyn before? If she was truly the one behind DR Holdings’ bestselling fragrances, why were they always credited to others?

Victoria narrowed her eyes. Something didn’t add up.

"Some of these forty-eight odors are very similar," she warned. "And I should remind you—protect yourself. You could damage your nose before you even finish."

Her tone was harsh, but Evelyn caught the underlying concern.

She smiled. "Don’t worry. I’ll complete the task and pass your assessment."

Victoria’s lips twitched, but she quickly schooled her expression. "Words mean nothing. Results are what matter here."

"Understood."

Just as Evelyn turned to begin, Victoria hesitated, then called out, "Hey—"

Evelyn glanced back. "Yes?"

Victoria exhaled sharply, feigning irritation. "Is that lawsuit of yours over yet? It’s dragging on like some never-ending drama."

Despite her tone, there was a hint of genuine concern.

Evelyn chuckled. "Thank you for your concern, Ms. Sterling. It’ll be resolved soon."

Victoria scoffed. "I’m not concerned about you. I just don’t want your personal mess affecting the company’s reputation."

Evelyn nodded. "I’ll handle it as quickly as possible."
###Chapter 71

Evelyn remained in the laboratory all afternoon, barely pausing to take a sip of water. Once immersed in her work, she became a whirlwind of focus, shutting out every distraction around her.

It wasn’t until a sharp knock echoed through the lab, signaling closing time, that she realized night had fallen. The task had proven far more complex than anticipated, throwing off her carefully calculated schedule.

Victoria had given her three days, and Evelyn had planned accordingly—based on her old lab habits. She hadn’t accounted for the strict regulations here. No overtime. No exceptions.

Security protocols demanded she leave on time. Only duty staff were permitted to stay overnight, a precaution against information leaks. This lab was her sole workspace, and even that came with restrictions.

Sighing, Evelyn peeled off her coat, gloves, and headgear, scrubbing her hands thoroughly before stepping out. The clock had already ticked past eight. Victoria had long since left—her role was to assign the task, not wait around for updates.

Standing outside the building, Evelyn surveyed the darkened windows, the dim glow of distant streetlights barely illuminating the empty road. Few cars passed by, and none were taxis.

She pulled out her phone, tapping through a ride-hailing app. No available drivers. The nearest town was two kilometers away—her only option.

Resigned, she started walking. The pavement was smooth, but the eerie silence and looming shadows made the journey unsettling.

A low hum of an engine broke the quiet. Evelyn turned, spotting a sleek black car approaching. She moved aside, expecting it to pass.

Instead, it slowed beside her, tires screeching to a halt.

"Damn it!"

She jumped back, her ankle twisting as she stumbled. Pain shot up her leg as she hit the ground.

The car door swung open.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked—anger, fear, irritation all warring inside her. She glared up at the figure stepping out. "Do you have a death wish or just no idea how to drive?"

"Why did you leap out of the way like that?"

Her breath caught.

Alexander Kensington stood before her, his expression unreadable in the dim light.

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. She wasn’t sure whether to laugh or scream. "W-What are you doing here?"

His fault for startling her.

"Who else would it be?"

He crouched, examining her ankle under the car’s headlights. "Are you hurt?"

"Just a sprain." She winced as he helped her up, guiding her into the car. The plush interior was a welcome relief.

Alexander slid in beside her, shutting the door. "Harrison, drive."

As the car pulled away, he turned to her. "Which ankle?"

Evelyn blinked. Was he seriously asking her to lift her foot in front of the driver?

"It’s fine," she muttered, fingers brushing the tender spot. "We can deal with it later."
###Chapter 72

It was a subtle movement, but Alexander noticed it immediately. His fingers moved swiftly to the control panel, raising the tinted partition that separated them from Harrison in the driver’s seat. Without asking for permission, he lifted Evelyn’s injured foot and rested it carefully on his lap. The soft glow of the interior light revealed the angry red swelling around her ankle.

His brows furrowed. "Why are you always getting hurt?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "How should I know?"

It wasn’t as if she tried to be this fragile. But here she was, nursing yet another injury—this time, thanks to Alexander’s reckless driving. Or rather, Harrison’s.

Alexander examined her foot with surprising precision. "No fractures. Just a sprain. You’ll need to apply ointment when we get back and stay off it for a few days."

Evelyn blinked. "You know how to assess injuries?"

"Basic first aid isn’t exactly rocket science," he muttered, lifting his gaze to hers. Then his expression darkened.

"Your clothes…" He hesitated, nostrils flaring slightly.

Evelyn stiffened. "What about them?"

"…Never mind."

Realization dawned. "Oh. The smell?"

Alexander remained silent, but his grimace was answer enough.

Evelyn sighed, pulling her coat tighter around herself. "I was working in the lab. Some of the compounds linger."

No matter how many times she scrubbed her hands, the scent clung stubbornly to her skin. She had stopped noticing it hours ago, but of course, others would. No wonder Harrison had given her that hesitant look when she climbed into the car.

"Lab?" Alexander’s eyebrows shot up. "Aren’t you supposed to be making perfume?"

The incredulity in his voice nearly made her laugh. His expression practically screamed, Are you joking?

"Yes, perfume," she said dryly. "But before you get the final product, you have to analyze dozens of raw ingredients. Some of them smell… less than pleasant. Today’s task involved breaking down forty-eight components of a particularly aromatic blend."

Perfumery wasn’t just about mixing pretty scents—it was chemistry, precision, and occasionally, enduring foul odors in the name of research.

Alexander fell silent, his jaw tightening.

Assuming he was repulsed, Evelyn shifted away, rolling down the window to let in the crisp night air. Heat crept up her neck. She hadn’t expected him to pick her up tonight. If she had known, she would’ve scrubbed herself raw before leaving the lab.

Then, without warning, a strong arm wrapped around her shoulders, pulling her back against his chest.

"Why are you sitting so far?" His voice was low, almost petulant. "Afraid I’ll bite?"

Evelyn stiffened. "I don’t want to suffocate you with the stench."

"It doesn’t stink," he insisted, burying his face in her hair. He inhaled deeply—then promptly choked.

Cough. Cough.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Really convincing."

Alexander cleared his throat, undeterred. "It’s just… strong."

She rolled her eyes. "I’ll shower the second we get home."

His grip tightened. "Good."

Then, to her shock, he pressed a kiss to the top of her head—right through the lingering scent of lab chemicals.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Maybe he was more stubborn than she gave him credit for.
###Chapter 73

The moment Evelyn stepped through the door, she headed straight for the shower. An hour later, she emerged in her pajamas, finally satisfied with the delicate fragrance that clung to her skin—a perfect blend of her custom body wash and the essential oil she had crafted herself.

Alexander had already showered in the guest bathroom. When he saw her step out, he approached with a towel in hand. "You didn't dry your hair?" He frowned, noticing her damp strands. Despite the hairdryer sitting unused in the bathroom, Evelyn always preferred to let her hair air-dry.

"I hate the heat," she admitted, reaching for the towel. But Alexander moved it out of her grasp and instead draped it over her head. His hands settled on her shoulders, firm but gentle. "Sit."

"I—"

She didn’t get the chance to argue. With a resigned sigh, she obeyed, sinking onto the couch. Alexander pressed the towel against her hair, his fingers working carefully through the damp strands. This is… nice, Evelyn thought, hesitating before relaxing into his touch.

At first, she had been wary of his attentiveness, unused to someone treating her so tenderly. But now? She was learning to savor it. The way he dried her hair, methodical and soothing, made her eyelids grow heavy. She tilted her head back slightly, surrendering to the comfort of it.

Alexander noticed her quiet contentment and smiled. He adjusted his movements, slowing his strokes, ensuring every strand was gently patted dry. Sleeping with wet hair was a bad habit, but since she refused the hairdryer, this was the best he could do.

Just as she was drifting, she murmured, "It doesn’t smell anymore, right?"

"Yeah." He exhaled, amused. Of all the perfumers in the world, only Evelyn could accidentally make herself reek of experimental scents. She’s definitely one of a kind.

Unaware of his thoughts, she kept her eyes closed. "With my special blend, I can’t stink. It’s just… today’s mix was a little too concentrated, so—"

"Don’t go back tomorrow," he interrupted.

Her eyes flew open. "What?" She twisted to face him—too fast. "Ow!"

Alexander dropped the towel instantly, gripping her shoulders to steady her. "Careful. Why do you always move like that?"

"This is my job," she insisted, rubbing her neck. "I can’t just quit halfway. And I promised—"

"Promised what?" His gaze sharpened.

"That I’d have the results in one day."

"One day?" His brow arched. "For 48 different scents?"

She blinked. "Wait. How did you know it was 48?"

Instead of answering, he countered, "Who told you to analyze 48 sources of bad smells in one day?"

She hesitated. Then, sheepishly, "…Me."

His expression darkened. "You did?"
###Chapter 74

"Yes, I set that deadline for myself."

"Are you out of your mind?" Alexander's grip on the towel loosened, letting it slip from Evelyn's shoulders onto the couch. The situation was unusual enough that he'd already had Harrison contact Gregory. According to Gregory, they were developing new products while testing odor suppression with fragrances. The team had been given ten days to deliver results, with three people assigned to the experiment—Evelyn wasn't one of them.

Gregory had been just as surprised and promised to look into it immediately. But Evelyn insisted she could gather the necessary data in a single day—and that she was the one who had set the impossible deadline.

Alexander could only stare at her like she'd lost her mind.

Evelyn didn’t understand his reaction. Tilting her head, she said, "I’m not crazy. It’s not that hard."

Her words left him speechless. He didn’t know whether to call her overconfident or outright reckless. DR Holdings assigned tasks systematically—challenging enough to push employees without overwhelming them. If management had given the team ten days, it was because they needed ten days.

"So you're telling me you're going back to that foul-smelling lab tomorrow? For an entire day?" Alexander inhaled sharply, already dreading the thought.

Is he worried I’ll come home stinking again? Evelyn considered it for a moment before offering, "Don’t worry. I’ll bring essential oils and fragrance samples. I’ll clean up before I leave."

"That facility is miles from the city, and you’ll be working ridiculous hours. Don’t go." For the first time, Alexander regretted the company’s decision to build the labs so far out. Cabs were scarce after hours, and last time, she’d sprained her ankle there.

Why the hell do they need to work until 8 PM? The schedule was absurd.

"I—" Evelyn started to argue, but the storm in Alexander’s expression stopped her. He wasn’t just annoyed—he was worried. The realization warmed her chest, though she couldn’t help but find it amusing.

She rose from the couch, then dropped to one knee in front of him. When she leaned forward, Alexander had no choice but to catch her before she toppled over.

"Darling CEO," she teased, "you’re the one who approved the lab location and working hours. Why are you mad about it now? Everyone else follows the same schedule—why shouldn’t I? Besides, the hours aren’t that bad. I could’ve left at six, but I got caught up in the experiment. Tell you what—I’ll wrap things up fast and come home early. Deal?"

Alexander’s frown deepened, his disapproval obvious.

He’s adorable when he’s like this. Evelyn bit back a laugh and pressed a kiss to each of his cheeks. Then, cupping his face, she brushed feather-light kisses over the tip of his nose before finally capturing his lips. "Please? It’s just one more day. You promised me creative freedom."

Alexander, who had been scowling moments ago, melted under her playful coaxing. He was utterly defenseless against her like this. With a resigned sigh, he cradled the back of her head and kissed her hard.

In the end, he always gave in to her.

At 11:30 PM, a call from the factory jolted Dominic awake. His irritation at the disturbance turned to fury when he heard the news.

"What? Say that again!" His shout was loud enough to wake Vanessa beside him. Rubbing her eyes, she sat up. "What’s going on? Some of us are trying to sleep."

Dominic shoved her aside and stormed out of bed. "You ran out of ingredients, and instead of restocking, you’re calling me? What the hell is Purchasing doing? Find a supplier—is that too much to ask?"

"Mr. Reeves, the missing ingredient is… the essential oil from Phoenix Labs."
###Chapter 75

"Essential oil?" Dominic paused, his brow furrowing. "Didn't we just deliver a fresh batch this morning? Are you telling me it's insufficient?"

"Mr. Reeves, the quality of that batch is unacceptable. We can't use it in production!"

"Unacceptable?" Dominic's voice sharpened as he paced the length of the living room, agitation tightening his shoulders. "We sourced it directly from DR Holdings. Are you implying the issue lies with us?"

The factory manager exhaled sharply. "With all due respect, my team has been working around the clock to meet the surge in orders. Every step of the process was followed precisely—our automated systems don't make mistakes. The problem has to be with the raw materials. You should come inspect it yourself."

Dominic's jaw clenched. Delays meant penalties, and penalties meant losses. "Fine. I'll be there in twenty."

As he ended the call, Vanessa emerged from the bedroom, rubbing sleep from her eyes. "Who calls at this hour?" she mumbled, her silk pajamas rumpled.

Dominic barely glanced at her as he shrugged into his coat. "Get dressed. You're coming with me."

"Me?" Vanessa blinked, suddenly awake. "Where?"

"The factory. The essential oil batch is defective."

Despite her protests, Dominic practically dragged her into the car. The factory loomed ahead, its floodlights casting harsh shadows. The manager rushed forward the moment they stepped inside.

"Mr. Reeves, thank God you're here. See for yourself."

A crate of essential oil sat in the corner. Dominic snatched a vial, uncapped it, and inhaled. "It smells normal."

The manager handed him a finished product. "Now try this."

Dominic recoiled as the acrid scent burned his throat. He coughed, waving a hand in front of his face. "What the hell? Was it diluted incorrectly?"

"Our machines are calibrated to perfection. The fault lies in the oil itself." The manager hesitated. "Are you certain DR Holdings produced this batch?"

Dominic's gaze flicked to Vanessa, who had been lingering silently.

She stiffened under their scrutiny. "What? We followed the same formula as last time. If there's an error, it's in the instructions—not my work."

A beat of silence.

Then realization dawned on her face.

The formula was hers.

And if the formula was flawed... the blame fell squarely on her.
###Chapter 76

Vanessa cleared her throat and rephrased herself, "What I mean is, the formula is flawless, so the issue isn’t on my end."

She turned sharply to the factory manager, her tone icy. "We follow the formula precisely. If there had been an error, we would’ve caught it long before production. The problem must be in your process. Have you inspected every step? Have you questioned your workers? Don’t just shift blame the moment something goes wrong."

"Ms. Blake, watch your accusations," the manager shot back. "We’re not shifting blame—we’re reporting an issue to Mr. Reeves as soon as we detected it. All we want is to identify the cause. After preliminary checks, we suspect the essential oil is compromised. If you disagree, then help us investigate. You’re the expert, aren’t you? The sooner we resolve this, the sooner production resumes."

Vanessa bristled. "Help you investigate? Do I look like I have time for this? Your incompetence isn’t my responsibility! The lab’s work is impeccable—figure out your own mess!"

Her harsh words visibly angered the manager. He turned to Dominic. "Mr. Reeves, what’s your take? We have deadlines looming. If this isn’t resolved soon, we’ll miss our delivery windows."

"Oh, so now you’re blaming us because you can’t meet deadlines?" Vanessa scoffed. "Your carelessness is the real issue here. You just want a scapegoat—"

"Enough!" Dominic’s sudden roar silenced her. "Arguing solves nothing." He thrust a bottle of essential oil into Vanessa’s hands. "Take this back to the lab. Run every test. I want to know if there’s even a trace of inconsistency."

Vanessa opened her mouth to protest, but Dominic had already turned back to the manager. "You did right by flagging this immediately. But don’t fixate solely on the oil. Check your inventory for any leftover batches. If you find any, send samples to the lab for comparison."

The manager nodded stiffly. "Understood. But we need to move fast. Delays will cascade."

Dominic clapped him on the shoulder. "I’ll handle it. Good work." Then he steered a stunned Vanessa out of the factory.

In the car, Vanessa glared at the bottle in her lap. "This is pointless. The fault lies with them, not us."

Dominic kept his eyes on the road. "You’re certain the lab’s process is airtight?"

"Absolutely. This formula isn’t new—we’ve perfected it over years. Unless..." Her voice faltered, then sharpened. "Unless someone tampered with the formula itself!"

Dominic slammed the brakes. The seatbelt jerked Vanessa back as she uncapped the bottle and inhaled. Her face paled. "Dominic... we’ve been played."

His knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "Evelyn left that formula behind. You think she altered it?"

Vanessa’s nails dug into her palms. "She’s been too quiet lately. No excuses, no outbursts. This was her trap all along."

Dominic hit the accelerator. "Lab. Now."
###Chapter 77

The morning air was crisp as Dominic Reeves instructed Vanessa Blake to summon all employees to DR Holdings.

By sunrise, the staff had gathered, their faces etched with confusion. The urgency in the message suggested something monumental had occurred.

Vanessa's usual carefree demeanor vanished as she meticulously analyzed the essential oil samples from Celestia Group's factory. Her perfumer's instincts told her something was terribly wrong.

Though she'd neglected her duties for years, her foundational skills remained sharp. The chemical composition matched the formula perfectly. Yet the final product smelled entirely different.

Dominic kept the crisis under wraps. "We're conducting an assessment for a new project," he announced, handing out samples. "Identify the differences between these batches."

The young perfumers exchanged puzzled glances but complied. Most were recent graduates—Dominic had never invested in proper training.

Back when Evelyn Carter worked for free, there'd been no need for additional talent. Now her absence left a gaping hole in their operations.

Dominic paced the labs, his jaw clenched. Time was slipping away. If they couldn't solve this mystery soon, the contract breach penalties would bankrupt them.

He paused outside Vanessa's workstation. She sat alone, forehead creased in concentration. Something nagged at him—then it clicked.

"Where's Isabella?" he demanded.

Blank stares answered him.

"I contacted everyone," Vanessa said. "Texts, WhatsApp—no response from Bella."

Dominic's face darkened. "Keep calling! Drag her here if necessary! This isn't some—"

"Morning, everyone!" A cheerful voice interrupted his tirade.

Isabella Thornton waltzed in, her designer bag swinging. "Wow, you're all here early!"

Dominic whirled around. The sight of her carefree smile made his blood boil.

"Do you have any idea what time it is?" he hissed through gritted teeth.

The lab fell silent as all eyes turned to the latecomer. Isabella blinked, her smile faltering under Dominic's glare.

"I—I thought the meeting was at nine?"

Dominic's fist clenched. The ticking clock and her obliviousness were a dangerous combination. Something had to give.
###Chapter 78

Sophia glanced at Dominic, then at her watch. "I'm not late. It's still early!"

"The company sent out an emergency alert. All staff were required to report to the lab immediately. Where were you?" Dominic demanded, his voice sharp with irritation.

"At home. Sleeping," Sophia replied coolly. "What notice? I didn’t see anything. And I don’t check work messages outside office hours."

"You think because you're senior staff, you can talk back without consequences? Everyone else is putting in the effort. What about you? Do you believe I won’t discipline you just because of your position?" He paused, as if catching himself before saying Evelyn’s name—a taboo in DR Holdings.

"Never mind. Go check the essential oils in the lab. Compare them to previous batches. If you do this properly, I’ll overlook your tardiness."

Sophia considered his words. She knew Dominic was desperate. Aside from Evelyn, she was the only one who might understand the issue. She had been Evelyn’s assistant, after all—familiar with every formula, every step. But lately, she’d been distant, her loyalty wavering. Rumor had it she was considering an offer from Phoenix Labs.

Still, Dominic had leverage—her contract. As long as he held it, she wasn’t going anywhere.

"What’s wrong with the oils?" Sophia asked, feigning indifference as she set her bag down. "You have all the formulas, Mr. Reeves. What could possibly be the issue?" She smirked when she noticed Vanessa watching her. "Besides, isn’t Ms. Blake here? Surely she doesn’t need my help."

Vanessa’s face flushed with anger. "Sophia Grant, enough with the attitude! This is a company evaluation, not your personal soapbox. Who do you think you are? Just do your job!"

"Attitude? I’m just stating facts. You’ve created plenty of successful products, Ms. Blake. A minor issue like this should be nothing for you. If you think I’m being difficult, fire me." Sophia shrugged. She had nothing to lose. In fact, she was counting on it.

"How dare you—" Vanessa seethed, but Dominic cut her off.

"Sophia," he said, forcing calm into his tone. "This is a company-wide assessment. Whoever resolves this issue will receive a promotion and a raise. My word on it." He locked eyes with her. "But you only have half a day. I need answers."

The rest of the team exchanged glances—promotions and raises were rare. But Sophia merely smiled, unimpressed. "How generous, Mr. Reeves. We’ll do our best." She rolled up her sleeves with deliberate slowness and took a seat, her expression dripping with sarcasm.

Dominic clenched his jaw but said nothing. Results mattered more than her insolence.

He turned to Vanessa, lowering his voice. "Still no progress?"

Vanessa scowled. "How would I know? You know the formula is—" She hesitated. "Why don’t we just ask Evelyn?"
###Chapter 79

"Fine!" Dominic contemplated for a moment before agreeing. However, his call only connected when he borrowed someone else's phone—Evelyn had blocked both his and Vanessa's numbers.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had gathered all the research and analysis data, compiling it into a comprehensive report. All that remained was handing it over to Victoria. She had completed the task ahead of schedule—it wasn’t particularly challenging for her. Talent had always been on her side. Besides, she had practically lived in laboratories for years, making the environment second nature to her.

Given the nature of her work, the lab included a shower facility. She indulged in a much-needed bath, dressed quickly, and was drying her hair when her phone rang. "Hello?" Evelyn answered, setting the call to speakerphone while continuing to towel-dry her damp locks. "This is Evelyn speaking. Who is this?" The towel muffled her hearing slightly. She discreetly sniffed herself, ensuring no lingering scents remained—she didn’t want Alexander catching any unusual odors on her again.

She’s doing this on purpose! After all this time, she dares to pretend she doesn’t recognize me?!

Dominic clenched his jaw, forcing himself to stay calm. "Evelyn, it’s Dominic. I need to talk to you. Can we meet?"

Evelyn glanced at the unfamiliar number on her screen. He must have used a different phone.

"No," she replied flatly, already moving to end the call.

"Wait—don’t hang up!" Sensing her intention, Dominic rushed to stop her. "I just want to talk. Haven’t things gone far enough? Do we really have to keep this up? We’re still friends, aren’t we? There are misunderstandings between us, but we can work them out—can’t we?"

"Friends?" Evelyn let out a sharp laugh. "Mr. Reeves, you must be dreaming."

Before she could disconnect, a shrill female voice cut in. "Evelyn, are you scared to face us? If you have grievances, say them outright. Must you resort to underhanded tricks?" Vanessa’s tone was razor-sharp.

"I think you’re the expert at tricks," Evelyn retorted, lifting the phone to her lips. "I have zero interest in whatever you two want to discuss. Whether we meet or not has nothing to do with fear—it’s common sense. Or have you forgotten your company is suing me? We’re plaintiff and defendant now. A private meeting would be highly inappropriate."

Her lips curled into a sardonic smile. "If you keep harassing me like this, I’ll record these calls and submit them as evidence in court." Without waiting for a response, she ended the call and tossed her phone back into her locker.

When she turned around, she froze—Victoria stood in the doorway.

Victoria raised her hands defensively the moment Evelyn spotted her. "I wasn’t eavesdropping. I came to find you because I heard you were in the dressing room. I didn’t catch much of your conversation."

Evelyn shrugged, pulling out a comb to tame her damp hair. "Doesn’t matter. It was nothing important anyway."

Victoria chuckled. "You sound confident. That’s reassuring—at least your personal issues won’t affect the company."

Evelyn met her gaze. "Ms. Sterling, does that mean you trust me now?"

"Let’s just say my opinion has shifted after reviewing your recent work." Victoria paused, then amended, "Actually, I read your latest analysis report. Impressive job."
###Chapter 80

"Thank you," Evelyn said politely. She was confident in her work, and there was no reason to downplay her efforts.

Victoria smiled at Evelyn’s self-assured expression. Leaning against the lockers, she turned to face her. "Honestly, I thought you were the one who had plagiarized DR Holdings’ work."

Evelyn arched a brow, unsure how to respond to Victoria’s bluntness. From their first meeting, she had sensed Victoria’s distrust and disdain. The way Victoria looked at her was practically screaming, You’re a thief!

Evelyn didn’t bother explaining herself. Words meant little when someone had already made up their mind. The only way to prove herself was through her skills—and time.

Victoria noticed her silence and continued, "Vanessa Blake was a legend in our industry. A dark horse who swept awards left and right. DR Holdings thrived because of her winning formulas. Asking me to trust an unknown like you? That was a stretch."

Her tone was lighter now, amusement replacing the earlier skepticism. "So, why trust me now?" Evelyn tilted her head. "What if I was the one who stole Vanessa’s work?"

Victoria laughed. "If you were the thief, I’d say, what a waste! With your talent, why plagiarize when you can create something better?" Her gaze was steady, sincere. "I believe in you now."

Evelyn felt warmth spread through her chest. "Thank you," she said, meaning it. Their relationship had started with hostility, but Victoria’s unwavering trust touched her.

Victoria clapped her on the shoulder. "I heard the odds aren’t in your favor for this lawsuit. But after that phone call? You’ll pull through. Lies can’t win against the truth."

Evelyn nodded, grabbing her bag from the locker.

"Still, don’t drag this out," Victoria warned. "Those rumors are damaging your reputation. You need to win—and fast. Then you can join my team."

"Of course." Evelyn smiled.

"Let’s go. I need sleep after this project." Victoria slung an arm around her shoulders as they walked out. "You always take cabs, right? Annoying. Let me drive you home."

Evelyn shook her head. "It’s fine."

"What, still holding a grudge?" Victoria teased.

"Not at all. You were just doing your job as manager."

"Then what’s the problem? Scared of my car? Or do you secretly love cabs?"

Evelyn laughed. "Neither. Someone’s already picking me up."

Victoria smirked. "Ahh, a boyfriend, huh?"
###Chapter 81

Evelyn smiled mysteriously, her lips curving into a playful smirk. Victoria raised an eyebrow but decided not to pry further. "Alright then, Miss Mysterious! Since your knight in shining armor is picking you up, I won’t play chauffeur today. See you tomorrow!"

Evelyn nodded, waving as Victoria pulled out of the parking lot. Just as Victoria was about to turn onto the main road, she glanced back—only to see Evelyn sprinting in the opposite direction. Curiosity got the better of her, and she slowed down, watching as Evelyn dashed toward a sleek black sedan and slipped inside. The windows were tinted too dark to reveal the driver.

"God, I’m such a gossip," Victoria muttered, shaking her head with a laugh. But as she pressed the accelerator, the sedan overtook her in a blur. Her breath hitched. "Wait—was that a Maybach?"

Inside the car, Alexander Kensington reached out, fingers brushing through Evelyn’s damp hair. "You smell incredible. Just showered?"

"Mm-hmm," she hummed, leaning into his touch. "Three times. Wanted to make sure I got all the lab chemicals out."

Alexander shifted, letting her nestle against his shoulder. He lifted a strand of her hair, inhaling deeply. "Perfect," he murmured.

Evelyn beamed. "I passed my evaluation. Officially a Phoenix Labs team member now."

Alexander frowned. "I thought Gregory already confirmed your position."

"It’s not about the title," she explained. "It’s about proving I belong there on my own merit." Since leaving DR Holdings, she hadn’t made many allies in the industry. The lawsuit and relentless media scrutiny had worn her down. But Alexander had been her anchor through it all.

His thumb traced the rough patches on her fingers—evidence of long hours in the lab, handling volatile compounds. "DR Holdings is about to have some trouble," he said casually.

"What kind?" she asked, letting him toy with her hand.

"Essential oil contamination in their latest fragrance line. Failed quality checks. They’ve even recalled staff from vacation to fix it."

Evelyn’s lips twitched. "That explains it."

"Explains what?"

"Nate and Vanessa called. Wanted to meet in person. Probably about their little oil crisis."

Alexander’s grip tightened slightly. "You didn’t agree, did you?"

"Of course not," she scoffed. "I’m the defendant, they’re the plaintiffs. We shouldn’t even be speaking outside court. Besides, I’m done cleaning up their messes."

Her lips, still flushed from her shower, pursed in irritation. Alexander smirked, captivated by her defiance. He cupped her chin, pulling her in. "Good answer," he murmured before closing the distance between them.
###Chapter 82

Evelyn hadn't anticipated the kiss—so sudden, so electrifying. Her eyes flew open in shock, her breath hitching in her throat. Couldn’t Alexander at least give her a warning?

But he hadn’t planned it either. The moment his lips met hers, instinct took over. The softness, the warmth—it was intoxicating. He deepened the kiss, losing himself in the taste of her, the way she trembled beneath his touch.

When they finally pulled apart, Evelyn gasped for air, her fingers clutching his shoulders for support. Alexander chuckled, his thumb brushing along her flushed cheek.

"You really need to learn how to breathe," he teased, his voice low and amused.

Evelyn was mortified. Every time they kissed, she forgot how to function. It was embarrassing—and yet, Alexander found it endearing. It meant she was inexperienced, untouched.

Dominic was a fool. How could he have ever let her go?

Evelyn was still struggling to steady her breathing when her phone rang. The shrill sound shattered the moment, but she was almost grateful for the interruption. She needed to clear her head.

She glanced at the screen and hesitated.

Dominic.

Alexander didn’t need to ask. The way her expression tightened told him everything.

Evelyn exhaled sharply before answering. "I thought I made myself clear—"

Dominic cut her off. "If I drop the lawsuit, will you meet me?" His voice was firm, insistent. "Avoiding this won’t solve anything, Evelyn. We need to talk. Just once."

Her fingers tightened around the phone. She looked at Alexander, searching his face for any sign of protest. But he only watched her, his expression unreadable.

After a long pause, she finally answered.

"Fine."
###Chapter 83

The moment Evelyn ended the call, Alexander's piercing gaze met hers. "Do you want me to come with you?"

She shook her head, a faint smile playing on her lips. "No, I've got this. But I will need to borrow someone from you."

His brow arched. "Oh?"

Dominic had chosen a quaint café on Violet Crescent for their meeting. Both he and Vanessa arrived early, their eyes fixed on the entrance. When Evelyn finally walked in, Dominic nearly shot to his feet—until Vanessa's sharp grip on his wrist yanked him back to reality.

Owned by Celestia Group.

Dominic exhaled sharply, forcing himself to relax. Right. Just because they were asking for a favor didn’t mean he was at a disadvantage. He still held the upper hand in the lawsuit.

Smoothing his jacket, he settled back into his seat—only to stiffen again when he noticed the man trailing behind Evelyn. Tall, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, with gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose, the stranger radiated quiet authority.

Dominic’s instincts flared. His gaze flicked between Evelyn and the unknown man as she approached their table.

"You made it," Dominic said, forcing a neutral tone.

Evelyn slid into the chair opposite them without preamble. "Let’s make this quick. I don’t have time to waste."

Vanessa bit her lip, her practiced smile straining at the edges. "Evelyn, it’s been so long. You look… well."

Evelyn’s lips curved into a smirk. "Oh? Maybe you should get your vision checked. I’ve always looked this good."

Vanessa’s laugh was brittle. "You’ve certainly gotten sharper with your words." Her eyes darted to the man standing behind Evelyn. "Who’s your… companion?"

Dominic leaned forward slightly, equally curious. The question had been burning in his mind since Evelyn walked in. After abandoning him and DR Holdings, she’d somehow aligned herself with Phoenix Labs. Was this the mastermind behind it all?

Evelyn gestured lazily. "This is Julian Whitmore, my lawyer. Given our… complicated history and the ongoing litigation, I thought it best to have legal representation present. Ensures everything stays fair and transparent."

Dominic and Vanessa exchanged glances, momentarily speechless.

Evelyn leaned back, pulling out her phone with a flick of her wrist. "Whenever you’re ready."
###Chapter 84

Dominic was taken aback when he realized the man sitting beside Evelyn wasn’t who he had expected, but her attorney instead.

"Evelyn, was this really necessary?" Dominic leaned forward, his piercing gaze locked onto her. "Can’t we just talk like civilized people?"

Evelyn barely glanced up from her phone, her tone indifferent. "Necessary? I did agree to meet you, didn’t I? If this is extreme, what would you call your underhanded schemes?" She tilted her head slightly, a cold smirk playing on her lips. "Besides, you were the one who filed a lawsuit against me. Having my lawyer present as a witness only ensures fairness. Shouldn’t you be pleased?"

"I already told you we’d drop the lawsuit," Dominic said, frustration creeping into his voice. "We were classmates. Friends. Even if that’s over, we don’t have to be enemies."

Evelyn remained silent, her fingers still scrolling through her screen.

Vanessa bit her lip before speaking softly. "Evelyn, I know you’re still upset about Dominic and me, but feelings aren’t something we can control. You were always buried in your work, and he needed someone who could be there for him." She hesitated, then added, "You shouldn’t let personal grudges destroy DR Holdings. It was built with all our effort. Do you really want to ruin it over something so petty?"

"Do you even hear yourself?" Evelyn finally looked up, her eyes sharp. "You’re saying the company is struggling because I’m being unreasonable?" She scoffed. "Dominic hasn’t been sleeping? How tragic. But let’s not pretend you don’t know exactly what Phoenix Labs has been doing."

Vanessa’s face flushed. "We’re all in the same industry. There might come a time when we have to work together. Why make this ugly?"

Evelyn ignored her, turning instead to Julian. "Make sure you document everything they’re saying. It might be useful later."

"Already done," Julian confirmed with a nod.

Vanessa’s patience snapped. She slammed her teaspoon onto the table, drawing stares from nearby patrons. "Evelyn Carter! Who do you think you are? Do you really think you’ve won just because you tampered with the original formula?"

Dominic stirred his coffee calmly, watching the scene unfold without interference.

Evelyn finally set her phone down, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "I’m sorry, I must have misheard. Did you just accuse me of sabotaging your work?" She leaned forward slightly. "Because if I recall correctly, DR Holdings sued me, claiming I stole confidential information. So how, exactly, could I have done anything to your precious formula?"

She emphasized the word your, her gaze unwavering. "But let’s say I did interfere. With your brilliant skills, shouldn’t fixing it be child’s play? Why come crawling to me for help?"

Vanessa’s face burned. She opened her mouth, but no words came out.

Dominic finally intervened, taking Vanessa’s hand. "That’s enough, Evelyn. We came here to settle things, not to fight."

Evelyn’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. "Then start talking."
###Chapter 85

Evelyn smirked at Dominic, her gaze icy. She had zero interest in entertaining him and immediately turned her attention back to her phone.

Dominic clenched his jaw. He knew she was deliberately ignoring him, so he shifted tactics. "Vanessa and I have been doing some serious reflection these past few days," he began, forcing a conciliatory tone. "Our personal issues shouldn’t interfere with business. Honestly, we don’t care who apologizes first. You’ve contributed a lot to DR Holdings, and we’re willing to drop the lawsuit. From now on, you can do whatever you want. Let’s just move past this, okay?"

Evelyn didn’t even glance at him. Instead, she turned to the lawyer beside her. "What do you think, Mr. Whitmore?"

Julian Whitmore had remained silent throughout the exchange, occasionally jotting down notes. At Evelyn’s question, he lifted his head. "Absolutely not, Ms. Carter."

Dominic’s expression darkened. "This is between us. There’s no need for outside interference!" He glared at Evelyn. "Where did you even find this so-called lawyer? He’s clearly unprofessional—probably a fraud. He doesn’t know what’s best for you. You won’t win in court. My offer is your best option right now!"

Evelyn scoffed. "Oh, should I be grateful?" She gestured toward Julian. "This is Phoenix Labs’ legal consultant. You really think he’s a fraud? Look at yourself—a pathetic excuse of a man who steals credit for other people’s work."

Dominic’s patience snapped. "How dare you!" he seethed, humiliation burning in his chest. "Evelyn, you’ve crossed a line!"

"I’ve crossed a line?" Evelyn’s voice dripped with disdain. "You accused me of betraying DR Holdings. You want me to just let it go? Tell me—why should I? When have I ever betrayed the company? I spent years in the lab, running endless experiments, traveling across countries for the best ingredients. DR Holdings profited off my labor. Meanwhile, what did you and Vanessa contribute? Nothing."

Dominic faltered, his mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water.

Evelyn’s lips curled in disgust. "Honestly, even the company’s name makes me sick now. I did all the work while you two reaped the rewards. Just thinking about it turns my stomach."

Vanessa finally snapped. "Watch your mouth, Evelyn!"

"What I say isn’t half as filthy as what you’ve done." Evelyn grabbed her bag and stood. "Let’s go, Mr. Whitmore. The air in here is rancid."

Dominic shot up and grabbed her wrist. "Wait! I didn’t call you here to argue. Can’t we at least talk?"

Evelyn froze, then slowly looked down at his grip on her. "No." Her voice was glacial.

Dominic gritted his teeth. "At least tell me—is there really an issue with the formula?" His voice wavered with poorly concealed desperation. If the formula was flawed, it wouldn’t just affect this batch—it would ruin DR Holdings’ future. He had to know, even if it meant groveling.

Evelyn met his gaze. The man who once looked at her with affection now wore nothing but panic. Pathetic. "Haven’t you figured it out already?" she said coolly before wrenching her arm free and walking away.
###Chapter 86

"Release me, Dominic!" Evelyn snapped, her voice icy. "Explain yourself. Now."

Dominic Reeves tightened his grip instead of letting go. There were too many unanswered questions burning in his mind.

"Your actions constitute harassment, Mr. Reeves," Sebastian interjected, but Dominic cut him off with a furious growl. "Stay out of this!" His gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Tell me the truth. Did you tamper with the documents? Are they forged?"

A cold dread slithered down Dominic’s spine at the mere thought.

Evelyn didn’t respond. Instead, she stared pointedly at his hand clamped around her wrist. "I’ll only say this once," she warned, her tone lethal. "Let go, or I’ll finish this the same way I did last time."

Her words triggered a sharp memory—the alley, the way she had effortlessly overpowered him. Dominic released her instantly, his pulse quickening. He hadn’t forgotten her speed, her strength.

"If you ever lay a hand on me like that again, Mr. Reeves, I’ll break it," Evelyn spat, wiping her wrist with a disinfectant wipe before tossing it into the nearest trash bin. Then, without another word, she turned and walked away.

Vanessa Blake snapped out of her daze as Evelyn disappeared. "Why did you let her leave?" she demanded, her voice shrill. "She hasn’t explained anything! Since when do you take orders from her? Have you forgotten the mess DR Holdings is in? She must have altered those documents!"

She grabbed Dominic’s sleeve, her nails digging in. "What were you thinking? Why didn’t you demand the real ones? Are you even listening to me?" Her voice rose hysterically. "Dominic, tell me the truth—you still have feelings for her, don’t you? And what did she mean by 'last time'? What aren’t you telling me?"

Her relentless questions grated on his nerves. Dominic’s patience snapped. "Enough!" He shoved her hand away. "This is your fault. If you weren’t so incompetent, I wouldn’t have had to beg her in the first place!"

Vanessa recoiled as if struck, her face paling. Dominic barely registered her shock—his mind was already spiraling into chaos.
###Chapter 87

Vanessa was utterly stunned. Dominic had never spoken to her like that before.

His voice softened as he tried to coax her, even though she was being petty. Normally, he would have been discreet—avoiding a scene at all costs. But today, he snapped.

When he turned to look at her, his expression twisted with distress. He wanted to sweet-talk her, to smooth things over, but frustration won out.

"I'm a mess right now," he sighed, running a hand through his hair. "I'll figure something out. You should go home and rest."

Without another word, Dominic walked away, leaving Vanessa alone in the café.

Rage burned through her.

For years, everything had gone her way—both in love and in her career. She had clawed her way to the top, becoming the undisputed queen of DR Holdings while pushing Evelyn aside.

She had planned it all perfectly. Once the company stabilized, she would retire in luxury, hiring a team to handle the tedious work.

By then, would DR Holdings even need Evelyn?

But now, just as she was on the verge of victory, everything was crumbling.

The company was in crisis.

Dominic’s attitude was shifting.

And it was all because of her.

Evelyn.

If that woman hadn’t reappeared, none of this would be happening.

Meanwhile, in the parking lot, Evelyn shook Julian Whitmore’s hand.

"Thank you for your help today, Mr. Whitmore. I’m sorry for the trouble."

Julian smiled. "It’s my job. No trouble at all. Though…" He hesitated, meeting her questioning gaze. "I think I understand now. Those two took your formula and then accused you of stealing it."

Evelyn’s lips curved faintly. "Yes. But we can’t use my word as evidence in court, can we?"

"Unfortunately, no." Julian studied her, surprised by her calmness. "You don’t seem worried about the lawsuit, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn tilted her head. "The plaintiff just begged the defendant for mercy. Have you ever seen that before?"

Julian chuckled. "No, I can’t say I have."

"Then I don’t need to worry." Her voice was steady, betraying no hint of anxiety.

Julian exhaled, amused. "Fair point. But may I ask—was the formula they referenced really yours, or…?"

Evelyn’s smile deepened. "There’s an old saying—don’t harm others, but don’t let your guard down either. I didn’t realize who they were until it was too late. But better late than never, don’t you think?"

Julian’s eyes gleamed with understanding. "Indeed. And if you don’t intend to hurt others, you won’t hurt yourself. You’re impressive, Ms. Carter."

"Flattery won’t get you anywhere, Mr. Whitmore," she teased. "You’re the one with the sharp mind and keen sense of justice. I still have much to learn from you."

Julian laughed and shook her hand again, this time with genuine warmth. "Pleasure doing business with you."

"Likewise."

After parting ways, Evelyn hailed a cab.

Victoria Sterling had told her she didn’t need to rush into work, but Evelyn wanted to settle in as soon as possible.

She was ready for her new beginning.

At Phoenix Labs.
###Chapter 88

The ride-hailing app remained unresponsive, showing no available taxis in the vicinity. Rush hour had paralyzed the city's transportation network.

Not owning a vehicle suddenly felt like a glaring oversight.

Dominic had purchased a luxury car that still bore his name in the registration. At first, Evelyn hadn't bothered with such trivial details. Now the oversight seemed foolish. Still, she refused to dwell on possessions tied to him. The car wasn't worth the emotional baggage.

Checking her watch, Evelyn considered boarding the approaching bus when a heavy hand landed on her shoulder.

The grip carried unexpected force, making her wince as she spun around. She attempted to shake free, but the fingers tightened like steel clamps. The pressure redirected her movement until they stood face-to-face.

"Evelyn, still playing hard to get?"

The man before her wore an immaculate white shirt with sapphire cufflinks that caught the sunlight. His gaunt frame belied his surprising strength. "Donovan?" The name felt foreign on her tongue after all these years. "Let's take this somewhere private." His raised eyebrows made it a command, not a request.

Without protest, Evelyn followed him through winding streets until they reached a deserted alleyway.

The narrow passage ended in a brick wall, creating a soundproof cocoon away from prying eyes. Donovan walked to the dead end before turning, one hand casually tucked in his pocket while the other hung loosely at his side.

"Been a while, Evelyn." His gaze traveled over her with clinical detachment, as if inspecting damaged goods.

"You tracked me down?" The coincidence seemed impossible. After all this time, he'd known exactly where to find her. Their separation had been deliberate - neither had attempted contact.

She'd burned every bridge when she left.

Now, facing him again, emotions warred beneath her carefully constructed calm.

"Why else?" Donovan closed the distance between them. "Look at what you've become. Is this really worth it?"

Evelyn glanced down at her worn clothes, remaining silent.

"Come home." His offer carried finality.

"No." Her refusal came instantly.

"Still clinging to that fantasy? After everything he's done? Don't tell me you're still—"

"We're done!" Evelyn's head snapped up, eyes blazing. "Dominic and I are finished. Permanently."

"Then why resist?" Donovan's gaze turned glacial. "After all this time, are you still holding a grudge?"

Evelyn worried her lower lip between her teeth before responding. "I'll return."

A weighted pause.

"But not today."
###Chapter 89

"You're still upset, aren't you?" Donovan Pierce shook his head. "Yes, Grandfather said some harsh things when you left, but he was angry. We're family. How can you hold onto words spoken in anger? It's been years. You've suffered enough. These rumors, the lawsuit—you brought this on yourself. And yet, you still refuse to come back?"

"It's not that I don't want to return," Evelyn Carter straightened her shoulders. "When the time is right, I will. I'll handle my own affairs. Don’t worry—no one will ever connect me to the Hawthornes."

That seemed to ignite something in him. "Do you honestly think we're afraid of being tainted by you? That you can just disappear and pretend we don’t exist? After all these years, you’re still as stubborn as ever."

"Then consider me exactly that," Evelyn replied coolly. "I’ll face Grandfather myself when I’m ready."

"You’re really not coming back?" Donovan took a step closer, looming over her.

He was lean, almost ethereal, his skin pale as moonlight. But his lips were a soft, deceptive pink, not bloodless like the rest of him. The contrast was striking—youthful beauty with an edge of danger.

Evelyn met his gaze without flinching. "No."

The word had barely left her lips when the air shifted.

Instinct kicked in. She barely had time to react before Donovan struck.

His movements were a blur—fast, precise, relentless. If she had hesitated even a second, she would’ve been on the ground.

They exchanged blows, the rhythm of their fight sharp and unforgiving. Evelyn’s breath came in short gasps as she barely dodged a kick aimed at her ribs.

Too close.

His foot stopped inches from her waist before he pulled back. The restraint was deliberate. He could’ve broken bones if he wanted to.

"Your reflexes have gotten sloppy," he remarked, voice light.

"I know," she admitted.

She’d realized it herself after her scuffle with Dominic Reeves’ bodyguards. Two years ago, she would’ve taken them down effortlessly. Now? Her wrist still ached from the strain.

"Last chance," Donovan said. "Are you sure?"

Evelyn didn’t answer. Her silence was answer enough.

"Fine." He stepped back, brushing past her. "Good luck."

By the time she turned around, he was already gone.

Her arms and legs burned from the exertion. Donovan hadn’t fought at full strength, but defending against him still took everything she had.

And yet…

This encounter meant one thing: her family hadn’t forgotten about her.

She had assumed Grandfather had written her off years ago, leaving her to rot in obscurity.

Apparently, she was wrong.
###Chapter 90

The entire team at DR Holdings' laboratory was immersed in their work, pouring over complex formulations. Essential oil compositions were notoriously intricate, with dozens of volatile compounds interacting in unpredictable ways. Even the slightest deviation in measurements could drastically alter the final scent profile, making troubleshooting nearly impossible.

Exhaustion weighed heavily on the staff. Dark circles shadowed their eyes, and stiff necks had become the norm—except for one person. Sophia Grant sat slumped in her chair, arms limp at her sides, head lolling back. The hum of machinery lulled her into an accidental doze.

Vanessa Blake chose that exact moment to stride in.

Her fists clenched involuntarily. After a sharp inhale, she forced her expression smooth and reached for a nearby lab coat to drape over Sophia's shoulders.

The movement startled Sophia awake. Blinking blearily, she murmured, "Ms. Blake... you're here?"

"Of course!" Vanessa's smile was saccharine. "You looked exhausted, Sophia. Tough day?" She produced a steaming cup of coffee with a flourish. "I brought you a pick-me-up. Care for a sip?"

Sophia's gaze sharpened instantly. She studied Vanessa like a scientist examining a suspicious specimen. Since when does the Ice Queen play nurse?

Vanessa's smile twitched under the scrutiny. Every muscle in her body screamed to snap, but self-preservation won out. She lifted the cup to her own lips. "Worried it's poisoned? Watch." She took an exaggerated sip. "See? Just caffeine and concern."

"Thanks, but no." Sophia's tone was flatter than a failed fragrance. "Besides, lab protocol prohibits food and beverages. The coffee's aroma could interfere with our olfactory assessments."

A rookie mistake—one no seasoned perfumer would make. The implication hung between them: Vanessa either lacked basic professionalism or willfully ignored it.

Vanessa's manicured nails dug into her palms. "Right! Of course!" Her laugh sounded like shattering glass. "I just wanted to check on you. Maybe you need a break? Let's chat outside."

She herded Sophia to the lounge, bustling about with renewed hospitality—fresh coffee, artisanal macarons, sliced dragon fruit arranged just so.

"Eat something," Vanessa urged. "You must be starving. Later, I'll treat you to—"

"Ms. Blake." Sophia folded her arms like a human shield. "Whatever this is, just say it. Your sudden kindness is terrifying."

Vanessa spun away, shoulders trembling. For three heartbeats, the only sound was her grinding teeth. When she turned back, the smile was back in place.

"Sophia, I know we got off on the wrong foot, but let's move past it." Her voice oozed sincerity. "You're friends with Evelyn without even working for her. Why not give me a chance?"

Sophia didn't blink. "No."

The lounge's air conditioning couldn't compete with the sudden Arctic chill between them.
###Chapter 91

Vanessa shot up from her seat, pacing like a caged animal, her anger barely contained.

Sophia ignored her, stretching lazily before turning toward the lab with deliberate slowness, as if every step was a chore.

Vanessa finally steadied herself, her gaze sharpening as she faced Sophia again. "Fine. What do you want? Name your price, and I’ll make it happen."

At this critical moment, Vanessa refused to beg Evelyn. Negotiating with Sophia directly at least kept the situation within her grasp.

Sophia tilted her head, a smirk playing on her lips. "Oh, how generous, Ms. Blake. Any conditions? That’s quite the offer. But tell me—are there any limits?"

Vanessa suppressed a scoff. Affection and loyalty couldn’t be bought, yet here Sophia was, acting as if this were just another transaction. Clearly, she had something big in mind.

Vanessa exhaled sharply, choosing her words carefully. "Power and position in DR Holdings aren’t negotiable. But given our history—and my relationship with Dominic—I can put in a good word for you. Wouldn’t you prefer a guaranteed favor over blind trust?"

Sophia tapped her chin, feigning deep thought before nodding. "Reasonable. But you said any conditions. Does that still stand?"

Vanessa’s eyes narrowed, hope flickering beneath her irritation. She forced a smile. "Of course. What do you want? A promotion? A raise?"

Sophia sighed dramatically, clutching her chest. "Both, actually. Am I being greedy? Oh, I must be!"

Vanessa’s smile tightened. "Greed is human. Now, about the formula—"

Sophia waved a hand, cutting her off. "Ah-ah! We’re not done negotiating."

Vanessa gritted her teeth. "Fine. Double your salary, and I’ll promote you to deputy manager of R&D. Happy?"

The offer was absurd—Sophia was nowhere near qualified—but Vanessa could always demote her later.

Sophia merely shrugged. "I never asked for that."

Vanessa’s patience snapped. "Then what do you want?"

Sophia stopped, clasped her hands, and turned fully toward Vanessa. Her smirk widened. "A raise, yes—but not double. I want ten times my current salary." She held up ten fingers, grinning.
###Chapter 92

"T-Ten times?!" Vanessa gasped, her eyes widening in shock. She couldn't believe Sophia's audacity.

Before she could even recover, Sophia leaned forward, her gaze sharp. "And as for the promotion... you're thinking too small. Why settle for just managing the R&D department? What I really want is your job." She pointed directly at Vanessa, her tone leaving no room for misinterpretation.

Vanessa's face darkened instantly. This was supposed to be a temporary negotiation, a way to manipulate Sophia into compliance. But now, Sophia had the nerve to demand her position outright? If Vanessa actually stepped down, what would that say about her authority—not just within the company, but in the entire industry?

Sophia, however, remained unfazed. She reclined in her chair, arms crossed behind her head, and smirked. "Oh, and one more thing. You’ll need to apologize to Evelyn—publicly—and admit you stole her research. Then I might consider helping you."

Vanessa’s patience snapped. "You’re pushing your luck, Sophia Grant!" she seethed, her voice trembling with fury.

Sophia merely shrugged, her smile infuriatingly calm. "Funny. You told me to name my price, and now you’re upset when I do? If you can’t handle the terms, maybe you shouldn’t have made the offer in the first place. This is just embarrassing."

"You—!"

"Relax," Sophia interrupted, waving a hand dismissively. "I was just joking. The real work still needs to be done, doesn’t it? I’ve got data to deliver to Mr. Reeves, and you—well, you’re our star perfumer, aren’t you? Surely you can handle this crisis without me."

She plucked a test tube from the rack, humming as she turned back to her workstation. Watching Vanessa fume silently was delicious.

But then Vanessa snatched the tube from her hand.

Sophia blinked. "Ms. Blake, I can’t work if you keep taking my equipment."

"Enough games!" Vanessa hissed. "If you want to play hardball, fine. Let’s be blunt—what did Evelyn promise you? She abandoned this company, left you behind, and now you’re still defending her? She’s making a fortune elsewhere while you’re stuck here fighting her battles. Tell me, Sophia—what’s more important? Your loyalty, or your career?"

Sophia sighed, shaking her head. "People like you will never understand. Not everything is about money."

"Sophia Grant!" Vanessa snarled.

Before she could continue, her phone rang.
###Chapter 93

Vanessa glanced at the flashing screen displaying Dominic's name. She shot Isabella one last icy look, thrust the test tube back into her hands, and hissed, "Choose your next words carefully. Don't embarrass yourself further!" With that, she spun on her heel and marched away.

"Where the hell have you been?" Dominic's voice crackled through the phone, sharp as shattered glass.

"I was at the lab," Vanessa snapped, bristling at his tone. "Trying to salvage this disaster since Evelyn refuses to lift a finger. DR Holdings is our company too, Dominic. Or have you forgotten?"

"Stop being dramatic. Nobody's sinking. Get your things - I'm picking you up in five," he barked before abruptly ending the call. Vanessa stared at her phone, then at the lab doors. No point begging Isabella again. Time for Plan B.

When Dominic's car screeched to a halt outside Phoenix Labs, Vanessa had already perfected her distressed damsel act - tousled hair, red-rimmed eyes, the whole pathetic package. "Dom, I—"

"What the hell happened to you?" He recoiled. "I said be ready, not look like some lab rat's chew toy."

Vanessa climbed in, bottom lip trembling. "I've been working nonstop. While you've been brooding, I've been testing every variable—"

"Any breakthroughs?" The hope in his voice made her stomach twist.

She shook her head mournfully. "The formula's too volatile. One wrong component and..." Her voice cracked artfully. "It's not just ingredients, it's—"

"Enough." Dominic gripped the steering wheel. "Evelyn wouldn't be so cocky if this were simple. There's someone who might help."

"Who?" Vanessa perked up.

"First, fix your face. We're making an impression." His critical once-over made her cheeks burn.

"Yes, of course." She fastened her seatbelt with exaggerated care, watching Dominic's expression soften. Good. Men always fell for the wounded bird routine.

Dominic's fingers suddenly gripped her chin. The kiss was more possession than passion, teeth clashing as he poured his frustration into it. When they broke apart, Vanessa's pulse raced - not from desire, but calculation.

Meanwhile, across town, Evelyn adjusted her rearview mirror, steering toward Crestview Heights. Donovan's unexpected appearance had changed everything.
###Chapter 94

The fight left Evelyn aching in every muscle. Her body screamed in protest, a brutal reminder of how soft she'd become since leaving the Hawthorne estate.

Freedom had allowed her to pursue her passions, but seeing Donovan today was a harsh wake-up call. No matter how far she ran, she would always carry the Hawthorne legacy in her veins.

As she soaked in the steaming bath, Evelyn noticed a dark bruise forming on her forearm - Donovan's parting gift. She'd need to tend to that later.

Her mind wandered to the encounter with Dominic and Vanessa. What should have been a dramatic confrontation left her feeling... empty. Not anger. Not resentment. Just pity for the naive girl she'd once been.

How foolish she'd been to believe Dominic was her soulmate, that Vanessa was a true friend. The memory made her snort with bitter amusement. The warm water lapped at her skin as she leaned back, eyelids growing heavy.

Alexander returned to find the bathroom filled with steam and silence. When his calls went unanswered, he pushed open the door without hesitation.

The sight froze his blood. Evelyn's body was slipping beneath the water's surface, her chin barely above the rising tide. "Evelyn!" He lunged forward, grabbing her under the arms just as the water reached her lips.

She came awake with a gasp, blinking up at him in confusion. "Alexander? What are you--" Then awareness dawned, and she instinctively crossed her arms over her chest.

"Out. Now." His voice brooked no argument as he lifted her from the tub, water cascading from her body.

Evelyn burned with embarrassment as he carried her through to the bedroom, acutely aware of her nakedness. He grabbed a towel from the rack and deposited her onto the bed.

"I can--" She tried to rise, but Alexander moved faster.

His hands pressed her back into the mattress, his larger frame making her sink into the bedding. Instinct made her grab his shoulders for balance. Her mind whirled - half from sleep, half from the sudden proximity.

Evelyn's breath caught as she took in Alexander's face mere inches from hers. Even this close, his features were flawless - like some divine sculpture come to life. Before today, she'd only glimpsed him from afar, this untouchable figure from society's highest echelons.

Now she could feel the heat of his skin, hear the steady rhythm of his pulse. The world narrowed to this single, electrifying moment.
###Chapter 95

"E-Evelyn—" Evelyn tried to speak, but Alexander silenced her by pressing a finger to her lips.

"Not a word." His voice was low, commanding.

Evelyn could only stare, her breath hitching. From this close, she could see the subtle movement of his Adam’s apple, the way his throat worked as he swallowed. Something about it was inexplicably alluring.

Alexander leaned in, his lips brushing against hers in a featherlight kiss.

Fresh from the bath, Evelyn’s skin was still damp, her body warm. Alexander had carried her from the bathroom, and now his clothes clung to her, soaked through from her wet skin.

Though she hadn’t kept up with her boxing training in recent years, Evelyn’s body was still toned—lean muscles, a defined waist, the faintest hint of abs from her sporadic workouts. Yet there was no denying her femininity, the soft curves that contrasted with her strength.

When she opened her eyes, dazed, all she saw was him—his sculpted chest, the taut lines of his abdomen, the way his muscles flexed beneath his skin. She had never imagined what lay beneath those perfectly tailored suits.

This wasn’t just good genetics. This was discipline. Years of effort.

"Alexander..." she whispered, her voice barely audible.

"Call me honey," he murmured against her cheek, his breath warm.

Evelyn’s face burned. She wanted to say it, but the word lodged in her throat, too intimate, too unfamiliar. She bit her lower lip, cheeks flaming.

Alexander chuckled, low and amused. He wouldn’t push her. She needed time.

His kisses trailed down her neck, light as a breeze, teasing, tickling. Evelyn closed her eyes, surrendering to the sensation. She had known this moment would come. She had agreed to this marriage, after all.

But when she felt his weight shift, his body pressing closer, her pulse spiked.

Her hands clenched at her sides. Her breath came too fast.

Alexander stilled.

He pulled back just enough to study her face—her tightly shut eyes, the nervous flutter of her lashes, the way her lips pressed together in a thin line.

This wasn’t desire. This was fear.

With a quiet exhale, he eased away.

Evelyn blinked, confused, when nothing more happened. She looked up at him, questioning.

Alexander had already regained his composure. The heat in his gaze had dimmed, though he still hovered close, his hands resting gently on her arms.

"Are you afraid?" he asked, voice soft.

Evelyn hesitated. Then, slowly, she nodded.

She wouldn’t lie to him. Not about this.

Her cheeks burned with embarrassment.
###Chapter 96

Evelyn Carter bit her bottom lip, her heart pounding. Why was he asking her this? She gave a quick nod before turning her face away, unable to meet his gaze.

Alexander Kensington didn’t need words—her reaction told him everything. He stood, retrieving another towel from the rack, then carefully wrapped it around her trembling shoulders. A soft blanket followed, cocooning her in warmth.

The tenderness of his gesture startled her. Evelyn turned, her wide eyes searching his face. When he caught her staring, he leaned down, pressing a gentle kiss to her forehead.

But she stopped him, her fingers curling around his wrist. Her voice was still rough from earlier emotions. "What does this mean?"

Alexander looked down at her small hand gripping his. The way she held onto him made his chest tighten—as if she needed him more than she’d ever admit.

"Why?" she whispered, confusion lacing her tone.

"There’s no rush," he murmured, brushing a strand of damp hair from her face. "I’ll wait until you’re ready."

He had assumed, given her past with Dominic Reeves, that she was experienced. But tonight had shattered that assumption. The realization that she was still untouched sent an unexpected thrill through him—not out of possessiveness, but because it meant she had trusted him this much.

Alexander wasn’t a traditionalist. Her innocence didn’t matter to him, but her comfort did. Evelyn was clearly nervous, unprepared to take this step. Pushing her now would only hurt her, and that was the last thing he wanted.

Love was something to be savored, not rushed. He wouldn’t ruin this moment for fleeting desire.

But Evelyn misunderstood. His earlier question had made her think he was doubting her. Determination flared in her eyes as she tightened her grip on his hands. "I’m ready."

Her voice was firm, but her eyes betrayed her—wide with fear, like a deer caught in headlights.

Alexander exhaled, a soft chuckle escaping him. He settled beside her, pulling her into his arms. Gently, he tilted her chin up, forcing her to meet his gaze.

"Do you love me?" he asked, his voice low, searching her eyes for the truth.

The question caught her off guard. Evelyn hesitated, her breath hitching.

The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken words.
###Chapter 97

It was impossible to deny that Evelyn had feelings for Alexander. Yet, she couldn’t quite define what they were.

Had their time together, or the things he had done for her, crossed into love? She wasn’t sure.

Alexander was everything—handsome, wealthy, kind, and endlessly attentive. He always put her first. How could she not be drawn to him?

But was that love?

Alexander only smiled at her uncertainty, unfazed. His thumb brushed lightly over her lips. "It's fine," he murmured. "We have time. There’s no rush."

His voice was soft, reassuring. "You’ll come to love me eventually."

Then, with a pause, he added, "But until then, I won’t push. We’ll only move forward when you’re ready—when you want me completely."

When he finally released her hand and stood to leave, Evelyn snapped out of her daze.

"Wait," she blurted. "What about you? Do you love me?"

Alexander turned, his eyes gleaming like stars against the night. "Of course I do."

Evelyn froze.

She had expected hesitation, deflection—anything but this. They had only just met. How could he already love her?

Before she could question him, he continued, "Just promise me one thing—stay awake in the bathtub next time. I’d hate to lose you before you even fall for me."

A faint smirk played on his lips. "Now, if you’re still hungry, get dressed. Dinner’s waiting."

Once he was gone, Evelyn sat motionless, her pulse still racing from his confession.

Eventually, she dressed and descended the stairs. The rich aroma of food greeted her before she even reached the dining room.

Alexander stood by the table, the cutlery already arranged.

"Did you order takeout?" she asked, eyeing the spread—perfectly portioned, mouthwatering dishes.

"In a way," he said, amused.

Technically, it was true. A five-star chef had prepared it and delivered it to their door.

He carefully deboned a piece of fish and placed it on her plate.

Evelyn hesitated. "You don’t have to do that."

Alexander didn’t look up as he peeled a shrimp. "Who says I’m doing it for you? I just enjoy taking things apart."

He set the peeled shrimp beside the fish.

Her plate was soon half-full—fish, shrimp, tender meat, crisp vegetables—all waiting for her.

A warmth spread through her chest.

It had been so long since someone cared for her like this.

Her entire life had been discipline, training, expectations.

When she was old enough, she left, chasing her own dreams—only to fail spectacularly, becoming a laughingstock.

And then Dominic—her final breaking point.

After that, she had cut ties completely.

But now, here was Alexander, peeling shrimp for her like it was the most natural thing in the world.

And for the first time in years, Evelyn didn’t feel alone.
###Chapter 98

Years of independence had shaped Evelyn into someone who relied on no one but herself. When she was still with Dominic, his work consumed him entirely. Even during meals, he would often leave before she finished eating. At first, Evelyn hadn’t minded, but over time, the loneliness gnawed at her.

Now, with Alexander, everything was different.

She felt cherished.

Noticing Evelyn hadn’t touched her plate, Alexander leaned forward. "Something wrong? The food not to your taste?" He had ordered a variety of dishes, wanting her to have options. "Tell me what you’d prefer instead."

Evelyn exhaled softly, her lips curving into a small smile. "It’s not about the food. It’s about who I’m sharing it with." She picked up her fork, spearing a bite and lifting it toward him. "Here, try this."

Alexander blinked, momentarily caught off guard, but then his expression softened. He accepted the offering, his gaze never leaving hers.

After a quiet moment, Evelyn set her fork down. "About what you asked me earlier…" She hesitated, then met his eyes. "I can’t say I love you yet. But that doesn’t mean I don’t care. I just need more time."

Alexander hadn’t expected her to address it so seriously. It felt almost clinical—like they were negotiating terms rather than discussing emotions.

This woman…

When he didn’t respond, Evelyn frowned. "I don’t want to lie to you. You deserve honesty."

"I know," Alexander murmured, his voice warm. "I told you—I’m not rushing you." The sincerity in his eyes was undeniable.

Relieved, Evelyn still couldn’t shake one lingering question. "Earlier, you said…" She swallowed. "Why do you love me?"

Silence settled between them, heavy yet comfortable. Evelyn searched his face, her confusion evident. Alexander’s dark eyes held depths she couldn’t decipher—like they carried secrets and stories untold.

Gently, he cupped her cheek, his thumb brushing her skin. "Everything," he said simply.

Her pulse raced, her breath hitching. The answer was vague, yet she believed him without question. Still, the intensity left her dizzy.

She covered his hand with hers, squeezing lightly. "I promise," she whispered, "I’ll love you just as fiercely one day."

Alexander smiled—soft, reassuring.

After dinner, Evelyn moved to clear the table, but Alexander was faster. He gathered the dishes with practiced ease, loading them into the dishwasher before she could protest.

"I told you," he said, turning to her, "the kitchen is my domain."

"And I told you," Evelyn countered, "I’m not some delicate princess."

Alexander pulled her close, his arms wrapping around her waist. His lips brushed her forehead as he murmured, "You’re my princess. The most precious thing in my world."

Then, taking her hand, he led her to the living room. "Wait here."

He disappeared into his study, returning moments later with a folder. Handing it to her, he said, "Take a look."
###Chapter 99

Evelyn accepted the documents with a puzzled frown, flipping through the pages until she spotted the insurance endorsement. It was a policy for her nose—with herself listed as the beneficiary. The coverage amount made her breath hitch. She glanced up at Alexander, eyes wide. "Isn't this... excessive?"

"Hardly." He arched a brow, leaning against his desk. "For a perfumer, your nose is your greatest asset. Talent can't be replicated, but protection? That’s just good sense."

It was true. A master perfumer’s ability to distinguish hundreds of scents was irreplaceable. Yet, only the elite in the industry bothered with such precautions. Evelyn hesitated. She wasn’t some renowned name—just an up-and-coming talent. Did she really warrant this?

Alexander stepped closer, pressing a pen into her hand. "Everything about you is necessary to me. Sign it."

Her chest tightened. The gesture was more than financial security—it was a declaration. She scrawled her signature, then met his gaze. "Thank you."

His lips curved. "Don’t thank me. Repay me."

Evelyn rose onto her toes, arms looping around his neck as she kissed him—slow, deliberate, pouring every ounce of gratitude into it.

Meanwhile, at Sapphine International, Vanessa adjusted her oversized sunglasses with an impatient huff. "Dominic, if you don’t tell me who we’re waiting for in the next five seconds, I’m leaving."

He barely glanced at her, scanning the crowd. "Someone important. Be patient."

Vanessa scoffed. Important? They’d been standing here for nearly an hour, and Dominic had been cagey the entire time. She’d dressed to impress—new designer outfit, flawless makeup—only to play guessing games.

Dominic’s phone buzzed. No answer—again. His jaw clenched. Things had spiraled since Evelyn’s transformation. She’d become stubborn, defiant, and Olivia—no, Isabella—had followed suit. The woman was practically begging to be fired, dragging her feet on every task.

His thoughts snapped back to the present as a tall figure strode past—gold-rimmed glasses, sharp features. Dominic’s pulse spiked. He fumbled for his phone, pulling up the reference photo.

That was him.

"Mr. Dubois!" Dominic called, grabbing Vanessa’s wrist and dragging her forward. "Wait—Mr. Dubois!"

Vanessa stumbled, heels clicking against the marble. "Who the hell—?"

But Dominic was already sprinting, desperation lacing his voice as he chased after the retreating figure.
###Chapter 100

The foreign expert halted abruptly, just as Dominic had anticipated. This confirmed Dominic's suspicions - he'd indeed located the right person.

"Mr. Dubois, I'm here to collect you. Dominic Reeves, CEO of DR Holdings. I believe Ms. Sinclair mentioned me?" Dominic flashed a practiced smile despite his labored breathing.

Vanessa stood beside Dominic, her gaze darting between her boyfriend and the mysterious foreigner. 'Who is this stranger?' she wondered silently.

Lucien Dubois assessed Dominic through his designer sunglasses. "Yes, she did mention you. Greetings." His tone remained icy, though he offered a polite nod.

"Wonderful to finally meet you!" Dominic extended his hand with exaggerated enthusiasm.

Lucien barely grazed Dominic's fingers before withdrawing. "Where's the vehicle?"

"Parked just outside! Please follow me." Dominic practically bounced as he led the way to the parking lot.

Vanessa studied the foreigner with undisguised curiosity. Lucien possessed striking Caucasian features - golden curls framing chiseled cheekbones that would make any modeling agency swoon.

Sensing her stare, Lucien turned abruptly. Vanessa blinked, then offered a tight-lipped smile. The afternoon sunlight glinted off his tinted lenses.

The trio settled into the luxury sedan - Vanessa riding shotgun while Dominic took the wheel. Though he maintained a personal driver, Dominic insisted on driving personally to demonstrate his commitment. His eyes kept flicking to the rearview mirror.

"Mr. Dubois, we'll proceed directly to The Chateau Royale so you may freshen up. I've arranged an intimate welcome dinner this evening."

"Acceptable," Lucien replied without inflection.

Undeterred by the lukewarm response, Dominic continued, "Your presence honors us. Ms. Sinclair speaks highly of your expertise. The challenges facing our company should prove trivial for someone of your caliber—"

"I require rest. Business discussions can wait." Lucien's interruption was final. He reclined his seat and closed his eyes, signaling the conversation's end.

Dominic's forced smile faltered momentarily. "Of course! Please relax. I'll alert you upon arrival."

Vanessa cringed at Dominic's fawning behavior. Through the mirror, she studied their aloof passenger. Whoever this man was, his manners left much to be desired. Yet Dominic behaved like a starstruck fan.

Owned by N?velDrama.Org.

Ms. Sinclair... The name triggered Vanessa's memory. Where had she heard it before?

She leaned toward Dominic, whispering, "Dominic, when you say Ms. Sinclair, do you mean—"

"Not now." Dominic's sharp headshake and meaningful glance toward the backseat silenced her. "Vanessa, you've been working tirelessly. Rest while you can. We'll properly welcome Mr. Dubois at dinner."

Vanessa pressed her lips together. The message was clear - explanations would come later.

"Drive carefully." She adjusted her seat and feigned sleep against the window.

In the backseat, Lucien's eyes slid open.
###Chapter 101

The moment they left Lucien at The Chateau Royale, Dominic checked his watch and confirmed their evening pickup time.

Finally alone in the car, Vanessa couldn’t hold back her questions any longer.

"Dominic, who is this Lucien Dubois? Why are you bending over backward for him? The way he looks at us—like we’re beneath him—makes my skin crawl. If he’s such a legend in perfumery, why haven’t I heard of him before? Or is he just full of hot air?"

Her fingers tightened around her seatbelt as she recalled his condescending smirk.

"We wasted an entire day playing chauffeur for a man who did nothing but criticize. Shouldn’t we verify his credentials first? What if he’s a fraud?"

Dominic’s grip on the steering wheel didn’t waver. "He’s the real deal. Pulling strings just to get him here wasn’t easy."

Despite the unresolved crisis, some of the tension had eased from Dominic’s shoulders. Lucien’s reputation was solid—unlike Evelyn Carter, whose raw talent still paled in comparison to industry giants. Her amateurish attempts wouldn’t even register on his radar.

Then Vanessa hesitated, voice dropping. "Speaking of connections… is Genevieve Sinclair your mother?"

A beat of silence. Then a stiff nod.

Years ago, Genevieve—once the brightest star of her generation—had traded the spotlight for a gilded cage, marrying into the Sinclair dynasty. The price? Abandoning her career… and her son.

Dominic had been raised by his grandparents, carrying his father’s name like armor. In public, he addressed her as Ms. Sinclair, never Mom. Few knew the truth—not even Evelyn.

Vanessa’s eyes lit up. "Then we can trust him! Your mother wouldn’t steer you wrong, especially now. With her backing, Evelyn doesn’t stand a chance."

Dominic’s jaw tightened. "I don’t like involving her. She made it clear long ago where her priorities lie."

Vanessa reached for his arm. "She must have had her reasons. Those high-society cages aren’t easy to navigate. But she reached out now—that has to mean something."

"Maybe." The word tasted bitter.

Genevieve’s rare visits had always been perfumed with guilt—expensive gifts, stiff smiles. A new family, a new life, one with no room for him.

That’s why he’d clawed his way up alone. To prove he didn’t need her.

Yet here he was, inches from victory, forced to reach for the hand that had once let him fall.
###Chapter 102

Dominic Reeves was taken aback when Genevieve Sinclair called him, but he had no choice but to accept her assistance.

All he wanted was for Lucien Dubois to fix the mess at DR Holdings and get them back on track.

When they went to pick Lucien up that evening, Vanessa Blake’s demeanor toward him had shifted entirely. Earlier, she had doubted whether he was a genuine perfumer or just another fraud, but knowing Genevieve had personally vouched for him eased her suspicions.

Genevieve moved in the elite circles of Montclair Heights, where the wealthy and influential gathered. Vanessa was certain Lucien could help them—after all, he had connections with the best in the industry.

"Mr. Dubois, we're so grateful you agreed to assist us!" Vanessa offered him a glass of wine, her maroon strapless dress nearly matching the rich hue of the bottle.

Lucien remained indifferent to their attempts at flattery. "Ms. Sinclair once did me a favor. Now it’s my turn to return it. I’ll do what I promised."

Dominic nodded eagerly. "Of course! This must be nothing for someone of your caliber, Mr. Dubois. Regardless, we truly appreciate your help."

Lucien took a slow sip of wine before lifting his gaze. His eyes lingered on Vanessa’s face, scrutinizing every feature—from the curve of her forehead to the sharpness of her chin.

Dominic bristled at the blatant appraisal but held his tongue. He couldn’t afford to offend the man who held their company’s fate in his hands.

"You’re a perfumer as well?" Lucien asked, his tone cool.

Vanessa blinked, caught off guard, then nodded quickly. "Yes, I am! Though I’m nowhere near your level, of course. You’re the master—I’m just an amateur in comparison."

She forced a smile, trying to sound as humble as possible.

"Didn’t you win a few awards? Created some popular fragrances?" Lucien swirled his wine, his voice laced with disinterest.

Vanessa hesitated, glancing at Dominic, who looked just as confused as she was. "I suppose I got lucky. There’s still so much I need to learn—especially from someone like you."

"Lucky?" Lucien let out a dry chuckle, his tone edged with mockery. "In this industry, some have talent. Some have relentless drive. Some are given opportunities. But no one gets lucky."

Vanessa’s cheeks burned. "Well…"

"You call yourself experienced, yet you can’t even distinguish the nuances in the formula?"

His words were sharp, his gaze dissecting her every reaction. Vanessa shifted uncomfortably, her fingers tightening around her glass.

Biting her lip, she muttered, "Mr. Dubois, it’s not that I can’t tell the difference—it’s Evelyn Carter. She’s just too cunning!"
###Chapter 103

"Oh?" Lucien arched an eyebrow, his piercing gaze fixed on Vanessa as he waited for her explanation.

Vanessa lowered her eyes, her fingers nervously twisting the edge of her blouse. "You must understand, even the slightest variation in ingredient proportions can drastically alter the final product."

She hesitated before continuing. "Evelyn modified the formula first, then secretly instructed her assistant to make additional changes. And with my recent illness—this terrible cold—they exploited my weakened state. We had no choice but to seek your help, Mr. Dubois."

Her voice trembled slightly, as if she were holding back tears. The distress in her expression was palpable, designed to evoke sympathy.

Lucien remained silent, his fingers drumming a slow, deliberate rhythm against the table. His expression was unreadable, leaving Dominic and Vanessa uncertain of how much he believed.

Dominic snapped out of his thoughts and quickly came to Vanessa's defense. "She's right, Mr. Dubois. Vanessa has been working tirelessly to resolve the company's recent issues. The stress has taken a toll on her health. Evelyn saw an opportunity and struck when we were vulnerable."

He leaned forward, urgency tightening his voice. "Our factory is swamped with orders. If we can't resolve this discrepancy in time, DR Holdings will face irreparable damage."

Lucien finally wiped his lips with a napkin and stood. "Very well. Let's inspect the lab."

Relief washed over Vanessa and Dominic. His agreement meant there was still hope. The tension in the air had been suffocating—for a moment, they feared he might refuse.

Dominic swiftly settled the bill, and the three of them headed straight for the lab.

The past few days had been grueling for the lab staff. The issue wasn't incompetence—it was the complexity of the problem. Even if they identified the altered ingredients, pinpointing the exact measurements was another challenge entirely.

To an untrained nose, the difference might be negligible. But for loyal customers who knew their perfumes intimately, even the slightest deviation would be glaring. A single misstep could tarnish DR Holdings' hard-earned reputation. Years of meticulous branding could unravel overnight.

They moved from lab to lab, finding no progress. Then they entered one that was eerily empty.

Vanessa frowned. "Where's Bella?"

One of the technicians hesitated before answering. "She said she was exhausted and went home to rest."

Vanessa's temper flared. "Does she not realize the severity of this situation? How can she just leave when the company is in crisis?"

Dominic placed a calming hand on her shoulder. "No need for anger. If she’s this irresponsible, we’ll simply replace her. It’s not worth the stress."

He turned to Lucien. "Since this lab is free, shall we use it?"

Lucien strode inside without a word. "Where’s the essential oil?"

Dominic gestured sharply to his assistant. "Bring it immediately."

Within moments, the vials were arranged before Lucien. His next demand was crisp. "The formula?"

A staff member hurried forward, placing the original formula, the latest batch, and the current analysis report in front of him.

The real work was about to begin.
###Chapter 104

Lucien Dubois's expression remained impassive. He leaned in to inhale the essential oil, his brow furrowing slightly before he scanned the formula. Then, a faint smirk curled at the corner of his lips.

"Pathetic attempt at deception," he muttered.

Though his voice was low, Dominic Reeves caught it immediately. His eyes lit up with excitement. "Mr. Dubois, does that mean you know how to correct the formula?"

"Correct it?" Lucien scoffed, flicking the paper dismissively. It fluttered to the ground. "There’s nothing to correct. This isn’t the formula."

A stunned silence fell over the room.

Dominic blinked. "Not the formula? That’s impossible! We’ve tested it repeatedly—the scents are nearly identical. If this isn’t the formula, how could they be so similar?"

The staff exchanged uneasy glances. They didn’t know who Lucien was, only that Dominic had brought him in. His arrogance made them bristle.

Lucien merely smirked. "Believe what you want. I don’t owe you an explanation."

One of the chemists stepped forward, indignant. "Mr. Reeves, we’ve spent days analyzing this. The discrepancy lies in one ingredient—we just need more time to isolate it!"

Dominic hesitated, torn between the team’s insistence and Lucien’s unwavering confidence.

Had Lucien made a mistake?

Lucien’s cold laugh cut through the tension. "Days? And you still need more time? Incompetence isn’t cured by time—it’s permanent."

The room erupted in outrage. "How dare you—!"

Dominic raised a hand, silencing them. "Enough. The priority is solving this. Whoever delivers the correct formula will be rewarded."

His words carried a veiled challenge—Lucien would only earn his payment if he proved himself.

Before the staff could protest further, Lucien scribbled something on a fresh sheet and thrust it at Dominic. "Here. Follow this."

Dominic took it, his skepticism evident. The others craned their necks, only to recoil in confusion.

"What language is this?"

"French," Lucien said, dusting his hands. "I don’t bother with English for technical work. Find a translator." He turned toward the door. "I’m leaving. I’ve wasted enough time here."

Dominic clutched the paper like a lifeline. He knew basic French, but was this really the answer? The team had worked tirelessly—how could Lucien solve it in minutes without testing?

Still, he couldn’t undermine Lucien in front of everyone. He pocketed the note. "We’ll proceed with Mr. Dubois’s instructions. Everyone, take the night off. And get me a professional translator—immediately."
###Chapter 105

Dominic Reeves had been preoccupied with resolving the essential oil crisis, leaving him no time to concern himself with Evelyn Carter or the lawsuit. Meanwhile, Evelyn had already moved on to a new work schedule.

Compared to the internet uproar that had preceded it, DR Holdings withdrew from the lawsuit with surprising quietness.

Netizens who had been eagerly awaiting a dramatic resolution were disappointed when the matter simply fizzled out.

Debates raged online. Some speculated that DR Holdings had backed down because they were guilty, choosing to release Evelyn under public scrutiny. Evelyn’s only response on her Twitter was a simple yet powerful statement: "Truth always prevails. I have no interest in this."

Those few words earned her a wave of new admirers. But Evelyn wasn’t concerned with managing her growing fanbase—she wasn’t a celebrity, after all. Her focus remained on her craft, on creating new and exquisite fragrances.

Early that morning, Victoria Sterling called Evelyn into her office. "Evelyn, do you have any pressing matters at home in the next few days?"

"N-No, nothing in particular," Evelyn answered, caught off guard by the sudden question.

Victoria nodded. "Good. If there’s anything you need to handle, take care of it quickly. I’m taking you on a business trip."

"A business trip?" Evelyn blinked. She had only just started at Phoenix Labs—being sent on a trip so soon was unexpected.

"Silverpine Valley." Victoria slid an invitation across the desk. "There’s a perfume sampling conference there. Plus, the environment is unique—plenty of natural ingredients for material collection."

Evelyn didn’t immediately agree. She wanted to visit Silverpine Valley, but she needed to discuss it with Alexander first. She’d be gone for several days.

"Evelyn?" Victoria’s voice snapped her out of her thoughts. "Are you alright? Don’t you want to go?"

"It’s not that," Evelyn shook her head. "I wouldn’t want to miss such an incredible opportunity. But I’m still new to the company. Aren’t you worried I might mess this up, Ms. Sterling?"

Victoria scoffed. "It’s just a conference. How could you mess that up? Besides, I see potential in you. Experience matters, but talent is irreplaceable. Not everyone can excel in this field."

She wasn’t wrong. The Project Department was filled with employees, but only a handful could truly call themselves perfumers. Apart from Victoria, no one else in the department had made a name for themselves.

Globally, only a select few perfumers ever reached the top. But Evelyn was different—she had raw talent. Victoria had initially disliked her, assuming she’d only gotten into the company through connections. But Evelyn had proven her wrong with every task she’d been given.

"Ms. Sterling, thank you for your confidence in me," Evelyn said sincerely.

Victoria waved her off. "Save the gratitude. I’m bringing you because I have something important to handle. Pack quickly—we leave the day after tomorrow."

"S-Sure." Evelyn was startled by how soon the trip was, but these events were planned months in advance. Dates weren’t flexible.

With preparations to make, Evelyn left work early that day. The house was quiet when she arrived—Alexander was still at the office. Slipping into a pair of cozy slippers, she turned on the stereo, letting soft music fill the space.

Then she brewed a pot of fragrant fruit tea, savoring the peaceful ambiance.
###Chapter 106

Evelyn had never mentioned to Alexander that she thrived in solitude rather than the constant buzz of crowds. She'd imagined someone of his stature would have an army of staff bustling through his home.

To her surprise, the house stood nearly empty except for the weekly cleaning service. The silence wrapped around them like a warm blanket, and she discovered Alexander even cooked his own meals. Though the space felt almost too still, Evelyn found comfort in the undisturbed peace.

A pot of citrus-infused tea steeped on the counter, accompanied by delicate lavender shortbread cookies arranged on a porcelain dish. When Alexander firmly barred her from the kitchen, she surrendered with a playful pout, settling obediently onto the sofa.

Before her lay seven miniature perfume bottles, their caps still sealed with factory freshness. After preparing a bowl of water, fresh mint sprigs, and linen napkins, Evelyn sat motionless. The recent turmoil with Dominic and others had left her creatively paralyzed, her usual spark extinguished.

This couldn't continue. If Evelyn kept draining herself dry, she'd become a hollow shell, her well of inspiration running barren. Victoria's proposal of a business trip suddenly seemed brilliant - a chance to breathe new air and rediscover her muse.

Evelyn's eyes fluttered open, focusing on the adorable bottles. She reached for a blush-colored one, bringing it to her nose.

The scent assaulted her senses before the cap even came off - cloyingly sweet, nearly chemical in its intensity. Disappointed, she returned it untouched.

These weren't prestigious brands but niche creations. Sometimes the most unexpected inspiration came from obscure sources rather than famous houses.

Though she'd set the bottle down, the fragrance clung to her fingertips. After washing her hands thoroughly, she selected another vial, her notebook ready to capture any fleeting inspiration. The familiar ritual brought her comfort.

When Alexander's key turned in the lock, a bizarre olfactory assault greeted him before he crossed the threshold. He retreated three steps, sneezing violently on the porch.

"You're home!" Evelyn's voice trilled as she bounded toward him.

Arms outstretched for an embrace, she forgot her perfume-testing hands. Alexander wanted to reciprocate, but his nose rebelled, triggering another sneezing fit. Evelyn froze mid-step, then sniffed her own sleeve.

"Too strong? I'll wash it off!" She spun on her heel, vanishing into the house.

Alexander waited until the air cleared before entering. He found Evelyn meticulously wrapping each tiny bottle in tissue before discarding them, then securing the trash bag with decisive knots. "Conducting experiments?" he asked, throwing open every window.

"Market research," she corrected, fanning the air. "Trying to understand current trends."

"Any revelations?" He dabbed his nose with a handkerchief, feeling the onset of a scent-induced cold.

"Only that they're repackaging the same tired formulas," Evelyn sighed, shoulders slumping. "New bottles, old tricks. Nothing groundbreaking at all."
###Chapter 107

The so-called "new" formulas were disappointingly familiar. At best, they had tweaked the ratios. Nothing groundbreaking—just recycled ideas. Evelyn had hoped for an unexpected breakthrough, but luck wasn't on her side.

"If discoveries were this easy, everyone would be a master perfumer," Alexander remarked, pulling her into his arms. "Have you eaten?"

"I have," Evelyn answered quickly, catching the glint in his eyes. She clarified, "I didn’t touch the kitchen. I left work early and grabbed dinner outside."

His tone turned mock-wounded. "You didn’t wait for me?"

"I was starving," she admitted, suddenly feeling guilty over something so trivial. She fumbled for her phone. "You haven’t eaten? Should I order something?"

"I don’t want takeout. Take me out to dinner."

"But I’ve already eaten!"

"Then keep me company," he countered with a smirk.

She relented, unable to refuse.

At the restaurant, Evelyn had planned to just watch him eat. But the rich aroma of seared wagyu and truffle butter proved too tempting. Before she knew it, she was on her third bite, then her fourth, unable to resist.

Alexander, meanwhile, sipped his wine with deliberate elegance, watching her devour the meal as if he were the one merely accompanying her.

"Another plate?" he offered, feigning innocence.

"No! I’ll explode," she groaned, pressing a hand to her stomach.

"Some yogurt, then? For digestion."

She shot him a glare. "If I’ve wronged you, just say so. No need for this slow torture."

His lips curved. "I only asked for company. If someone couldn’t control their appetite, that’s hardly my fault."

Technically true—but if he hadn’t lured her here, she wouldn’t be in this state. "It is your fault," she insisted.

Alexander nodded thoughtfully. "I see. Then is it also my fault you’re leaving for a business trip without telling me?"

Evelyn froze mid-bite. "How did you—?"
###Chapter 108

The moment the words slipped out, Evelyn realized how ridiculous her question sounded. Of course Dominic would know.

Working at the same company as your husband was complicated enough—but when he was also your boss? That was a recipe for disaster. And if anything went sideways, he'd be the first to know.

She exhaled sharply, frustration tightening her features. "Since you're already aware, then you should also know this was the company's decision. As a junior employee, I don’t exactly have the luxury of refusing."

Dominic’s gaze darkened. "Why do I sense resentment in your tone? If you don’t want to go—"

Evelyn cut him off before he could finish. "Who said I don’t want to go? I just haven’t had the chance to tell you yet. That doesn’t mean I was hiding it."

"Silverpine Valley has drastic temperature shifts between day and night. Pack a jacket," he replied, deliberately steering the conversation away.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. She had braced herself for resistance, but he was letting it go far more easily than she’d anticipated.

Then again, if DR Holdings had arranged it, he must have known long before she did. How foolish of her to worry he’d object.

The fact that Alexander Kensington showed no unusual reaction to her business trip was a relief. With this kind of cooperation, navigating their professional and personal lives would be much smoother.

Her position might be stable, but fieldwork was still part of the job—scouting ingredients, seeking inspiration, attending industry seminars. If he had forbidden something as routine as a business trip, it would have set a dangerous precedent. His lack of restrictions only deepened her admiration for him.

"I forbid it!" Dominic’s voice was steel, his eyes locked straight ahead.

Vanessa, draped against his side, frowned. "Dom, don’t be unreasonable. This is an incredible opportunity. I haven’t participated in events like this in ages, and there’s a sampling session. Lucien Dubois is attending too—it’s a chance to network with—"

"I forbid it especially because he’s involved," Dominic snapped, cutting her off. "The answer is no."

Vanessa’s temper flared. "Then who will go? You? Who else understands the essential oils and foreign suppliers like I do? Unless…" Her voice turned sharp. "You’ve got someone new lined up? Someone you’d rather send in my place?" She jerked away, eyes blazing. "Is it that intern, Cassie? I saw the way you looked at her last week!"

Dominic’s jaw clenched. "Don’t be absurd. There’s no one else. I don’t even know who you’re talking about."

"Then why won’t you let me go?" Vanessa pouted, clinging to his arm and shaking it. "Dom, please. This isn’t just for me—it’s for DR Holdings. If we break into Silverpine Valley’s market, supply chains will streamline, sales channels will expand. And we’re short on talent—this trip could help us scout fresh recruits!"

When he turned to look at her, her wide, pleading eyes glistened. The sight softened him instantly.

Vanessa knew him too well. She had a way of dismantling his resistance without him even realizing it. His voice gentled. "V, it’s not that I don’t want you to go. If I could accompany you, we’d leave tomorrow. But I’m swamped, and the thought of you going alone—"

"Who said I’d be alone? Lucien Dubois is going as a VIP! Aligning with him would be strategic."

Dominic’s expression darkened again. "That’s exactly the problem." His voice dropped dangerously. "Vanessa, don’t tell me you haven’t noticed how he looks at you."

She fell silent.

After a beat, she scoffed. "You’re imagining things. Your mother introduced us. He’s a professional—not some lovesick fool like you." She rolled her eyes. "Not every man is obsessed with me, Dom. You worry too much."
###Chapter 109

Dominic chuckled helplessly, his fingers brushing through Vanessa’s hair. “You know I treat you like my most precious treasure, don’t you? So, don’t be stubborn about this, alright?”

His grip tightened slightly. “But I still don’t like the way Lucien looks at you.”

Any woman would melt at the possessive edge in his voice.

Vanessa grinned, her eyes crinkling with amusement before she buried her face against his chest. “You’re so jealous. I haven’t seen this side of you in ages—it makes me happy!” She pulled back just enough to tease, “But I still think I should go with Mr. Dubois.”

“Like hell you will!” Dominic’s arm snaked around her waist, his voice dropping to a growl. “I’ll break those pretty legs of yours if you even think about running off with him.”

Vanessa bit her lip, feigning innocence. “Oh, how terrifying, Mr. Reeves.” Then, her expression softened, a shy smile playing on her lips. “You really don’t need to worry. Even if Lucien has feelings for me, nothing will happen. Especially since…”

“Since what?” Dominic frowned, not following.

“I’m…”

At first, he didn’t understand her hesitation. Then it hit him like lightning. His arms locked around her, his voice trembling with excitement. “Are you—? You’re pregnant?! Seriously? Am I the father?”

He looked so boyishly thrilled that Vanessa smacked his shoulder. “What kind of ridiculous question is that? Who else would it be?!”

“Yes! I’m going to be a father!” Dominic’s joy was so palpable it felt like he could already hold their child in his arms.

“Relax. I might be pregnant. I’m not completely sure yet.”

“Not sure?”

Vanessa nodded. “My period’s two weeks late, and I’ve been feeling nauseous. I took a test—it showed two faint lines. It’s probably positive, but I’ll go to the hospital in a few days to confirm.”

Dominic’s brows knitted together. “It’s either yes or no. How can it be a maybe?” He exhaled sharply. “Why didn’t you just go to the doctor?”

“It’s too early. I heard they might not detect anything yet.” She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “But the test did show something, so… I’ll know for sure soon.”

Dominic nodded rapidly. “Good. Then I was right—you shouldn’t be running around like this.” He circled back to his original argument.

Vanessa immediately stiffened, pushing away from him. “No, you weren’t right! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If I am pregnant, I won’t be able to attend events like this for years. No traveling, no networking—I’ll regret it forever if I don’t go now!”

Dominic had no defense against her pleading, especially not with the possibility of a baby hanging between them. He sighed. “B-But—”

“Just this once, okay?” Vanessa softened her voice, pressing closer. “After this, I’ll listen to everything you say. I promise.”

She knew exactly how to handle him.

She’d studied Dominic’s temperament back when he was still with Evelyn. It hadn’t taken her long to wrap him around her finger. He never disobeyed her—never even thought to.

Sure enough, Dominic caved. He raised his hands in surrender. “Fine. You win. But you have to promise me—no getting too close to Lucien. And I’m sending someone with you.”

Vanessa’s smile faltered. “You don’t trust me?”

“It’s not about trust.” He cupped her face. “It’s about keeping you safe. If Lucien tries anything, I want someone there to protect you. And if anything happens while you’re away, I need to know you’re taken care of.”
###Chapter 110

Vanessa swayed her hips playfully. "Why won't you trust me?"

"If you don't like the arrangement, then don't go. I'm done discussing this." Dominic had no patience left for Vanessa's coquettish arguments. That was his final word.

Still, he wanted to attend the Silverpine Valley conference himself. Rumors suggested many industry experts would be present. Besides participating, Dominic planned to scout fresh talent for DR Holdings.

Evelyn's recent schemes had caused significant trouble for the company. Dominic understood the value of skilled perfumers now more than ever. He needed to strengthen his team to prevent future threats. The experience had been nothing short of disastrous.

Yet, the essential oil crisis demanded his full attention. He couldn't afford to leave while critical tests were underway. Every formula had to be flawless, and he refused to delegate that responsibility.

Still, sending Vanessa wouldn't hurt. It would be good experience for her, even if she lacked Evelyn's expertise. At least she was loyal—and now, with the baby, she was even more tied to him.

Dominic's gaze dropped to Vanessa's still-flat abdomen. A tiny life grew there, and the thought sent a rush of warmth through him.

Vanessa, however, wasn't as thrilled. She wanted freedom, not a babysitter trailing her every move. What would Lucien Dubois think if some watchdog shadowed them? It was ridiculous.

But for now, she'd play along. One step at a time.

Alexander Kensington didn’t escort Evelyn to the airport. She insisted on taking a cab alone, refusing even her usual driver. She didn’t want prying eyes noticing her departure.

Before leaving, she wrapped her arms around Alexander, sensing his simmering displeasure. "Absence makes the heart grow fonder," she teased lightly. "Don’t miss me too much—I’ll be back before you know it."

"Likewise," Alexander murmured, pulling her close before pinching her waist sharply.

"Ow!" Evelyn yelped, glaring at him. "You’re impossible."

With that, she slipped into the cab, leaving Alexander standing on the curb as the car disappeared down the driveway.

Harrison, silent as ever, finally spoke. "Sir, are you certain you don’t want to inform Mrs. Kensington that you’re attending as well?"

Alexander tilted his head, a slow smirk curving his lips. "Where’s the fun in that?"

Harrison hesitated. "I—well—"

Fun? Harrison had no idea just how mischievous his boss could be.

"Did you upgrade the seats?" Alexander asked, turning back toward the house.

"Yes, including Ms. Carter’s. As instructed, I informed them this trip was a crucial corporate engagement with special arrangements."

Harrison had handled it discreetly through Gregory Whitmore.

"Good." Alexander exhaled sharply, stepping inside. The house felt hollow without Evelyn. Too quiet. Too empty.

He hated it.
###Chapter 111

Vanessa couldn't suppress her excitement as she settled into the plush first-class seat, her fingers tracing the buttery leather armrests. The difference between standard and first-class was like night and day. She stole a glance at Lucien beside her, her lips curving into a satisfied smile. This luxury was all his doing.

Dominic had never once upgraded their tickets during all their business trips together. "We must be frugal," he'd always say, adjusting his tie while citing company expenses. Vanessa had swallowed her disappointment, believing his promises that their sacrifices would pay off someday. Yet here she was, sipping champagne before takeoff, while Dominic remained a distant memory.

"Mr. Dubois," she purred, leaning slightly toward him, "I'm truly grateful for this opportunity to accompany you to the sampling event. Do guide me if I make any missteps."

Lucien's gaze traveled slowly from her designer heels to her carefully styled hair. "Intelligent women like you learn quickly," he murmured, his French accent thickening.

"You really think so?" Vanessa's hand fluttered to her hair, her pulse quickening at his attention. "Then I'll rely on your expert guidance."

His fingers brushed against hers as he reached for his drink. "I'll ensure you receive the finest education," he said, his voice dropping to a whisper that sent shivers down her spine.

Vanessa opened her mouth to respond when a familiar laugh cut through the cabin. Her head snapped toward the sound, and her blood ran cold. Evelyn Carter stood at the entrance, looking every bit the polished professional in her tailored suit.

'What the hell is she doing here?' Vanessa's nails dug into her palms.

Evelyn followed Victoria Sterling to their newly upgraded seats, courtesy of Phoenix Labs' sudden generosity. "They want us well-rested for the event," Victoria explained, checking her upgraded boarding pass. But Evelyn's brow furrowed. 'Since when does corporate care about two-hour flights? And why upgrade us last minute?' The whole situation reeked of someone's personal agenda.

Suppressing her suspicions, Evelyn followed Victoria into first class - only to lock eyes with her least favorite person. The universe clearly had a cruel sense of humor.

"Disgusting," Vanessa muttered under her breath.

Lucien followed her glare. "Acquaintances of yours?" he asked, one eyebrow arched.

"That woman nearly ruined our essential oil project," Vanessa hissed, leaning closer to whisper in his ear. "She's manipulative and dangerous. You'd do well to keep your distance, Mr. Dubois."

Lucien turned, his face mere inches from Vanessa's. "Why would I look elsewhere," he murmured, placing his hand over hers, "when perfection sits beside me?"

Vanessa froze, torn between pulling away and leaning into his touch. His intense gaze pinned her in place. "Of course," she managed, forcing a smile. "We understand each other perfectly."

Across the aisle, Evelyn observed the intimate exchange with growing unease. Victoria followed her gaze and immediately recognized Vanessa from industry gossip. "Isn't that—"

"Yes," Evelyn cut in, her voice tight. "Exactly who you think it is."
###Chapter 112

"You two are sworn enemies!" Victoria chuckled as she settled into her seat, adjusting the plush cushion. "Should I order some champagne to go with the show?"

"There's nothing worth watching," Evelyn replied smoothly, draping a cashmere throw over her lap. "If she keeps to herself, so will I. Peace is preferable."

She reclined her seat with practiced ease, prioritizing professionalism over personal grudges. Business trips weren’t the place for petty drama—especially not when DR Holdings' reputation was at stake.

"How delightfully boring!" Victoria turned to Evelyn with a mischievous grin. "But can you really trust her not to strike first?"

If Vanessa Blake were the type to avoid conflict, their history wouldn’t be littered with so many explosive confrontations.

"Wait—who’s that man beside her?" Victoria squinted, curiosity piqued.

She recognized Dominic Reeves instantly, but this stranger was definitely not him. Weren’t those two practically glued together at every public event?

Evelyn had already noticed Dominic’s absence. But as long as Vanessa and her mysterious companion didn’t provoke her, she couldn’t care less who he was.

"Victoria, didn’t you say the sampling starts tonight?" Evelyn shot her a pointed look before closing her eyes. "Shouldn’t you rest while you can?"

What a masterful dismissal. Victoria smirked, then followed suit, shutting her eyes. Corporate perks like first-class flights were rare—might as well enjoy them.

While the two women feigned serenity, Vanessa seethed in her seat.

She kept stealing glances, her irritation mounting as Evelyn and Victoria appeared utterly unbothered.

First-class was supposed to be exclusive. Why did Evelyn Carter have to invade her space yet again?

Vanessa clenched her fists. Dominic had been too busy with essential oil negotiations to accompany her—all because of Evelyn. And yet, the woman responsible slept soundly, as if she hadn’t upended Vanessa’s life.

Her resentment simmered until a warm hand closed over hers.

Lucien Dubois didn’t open his eyes, but his lips curved knowingly. "Revenge isn’t about public spectacles," he murmured. "There are far more elegant ways to ruin someone."

Vanessa stayed silent.

He finally looked at her, his gaze sharp. "And I’d be happy to assist."

The two-hour flight left Vanessa restless. The thrill of first-class had long evaporated, replaced by smoldering fury—and Lucien’s unnervingly persistent grip on her hand.

Something told her this trip to Silverpine Valley wouldn’t be the glamorous escape she’d envisioned. Dominic had warned her about Lucien’s ulterior motives, but offending him wasn’t an option. Caution was her only shield.

And then there was Evelyn. Of course she’d be at the sampling. It was infuriating how effortlessly the woman thrived after leaving DR Holdings—now flaunting her first-class upgrades like some triumphant victor.

Vanessa’s nails dug into her palm.

Evelyn Carter would not enjoy peace for long.
###Chapter 113

The wheels touched down smoothly at our destination, and everything had been meticulously arranged in advance.

On Vanessa's side, Dominic had taken care of every detail, including pre-booking their hotel. Though Vanessa stood by the car door, her attention was elsewhere—she was determined to catch a glimpse of Evelyn's ride.

Even if Celestia Group backed Phoenix Labs, they were still just a minor subsidiary. They might not rival DR Holdings in scale, but clearly, they wanted to put on airs and travel in first-class style.

"Ms. Blake?" The driver waiting for her hesitated, wondering why she hadn’t gotten in yet.

"Just a moment," Vanessa murmured, her fingers tightening around the car door. Then, she spotted them.

Evelyn and Victoria weren’t in any rush. They strolled leisurely through the terminal, pulling their luggage behind them. And then—

A Rolls-Royce.

Vanessa’s breath hitched. There was no mistaking that sleek, luxurious silhouette. She couldn’t pinpoint the exact model, but it was undeniably expensive.

Her gaze locked onto Evelyn as the trunk opened, swallowing their suitcases effortlessly. Then, without so much as a glance in her direction, Evelyn slid into the backseat, and the car glided away.

Vanessa’s grip on the door turned white-knuckled. She couldn’t lie to herself anymore—that car had been for them.

How? How could Evelyn be the one riding in a Rolls-Royce while Vanessa was left with this outdated Mercedes?

She turned back to the car waiting for her, the one she’d been pleased with moments ago. Now, it felt like a slap in the face.

"Are you getting in, or should we leave without you?" Lucien’s dry voice drifted from inside.

Vanessa forced herself into the seat, her mood souring with every passing second.

Evelyn was her curse. Every encounter with her left Vanessa humiliated, her pride in tatters.

Lucien remained impassive, but she knew he’d noticed her reaction. There was no point hiding it now.

"Mr. Dubois," she began, her voice tight, "someone of your stature deserves the best, doesn’t he? Don’t you feel… undervalued with arrangements like this?"

A faint smirk curled his lips. "A bit shabby, I’ll admit."

The casual dismissal made her cheeks burn.

"Not that I care much about such things when traveling," he continued smoothly. "Though I did upgrade my hotel suite earlier. The standard rooms here are… lacking."

Vanessa perked up. "The presidential suite?"

He shrugged. "Only mine was upgraded. Yours remains as booked, I’m afraid. We won’t be on the same floor, Vanessa."

She fell silent, her frustration simmering.

When they arrived at The Chateau Royale, the receptionists fawned over Lucien, their enthusiasm grating on her nerves.

And just like that, her mood plummeted even further.
###Chapter 114

Wealth truly was a marvelous thing. The world bent over backward for those with deep pockets. Lucien still possessed some gentlemanly manners—since her room was on a lower floor, he escorted her there first.

Vanessa’s brows knitted the moment she pushed open the door.

The room was a standard suite—spacious by ordinary hotel standards, but far from what she had envisioned. A bed, an ensuite bathroom, a microwave, a mini-fridge, and a sink. Functional, yes. Luxurious? Hardly.

"Vanessa, your belongings are all here. Rest well. I’ll head to my room now." Lucien gave her shoulder a light pat, his smile easy.

She caught his wrist before he could leave. "Wait!"

He paused, glancing back with a silent question in his eyes.

"Um..." She hesitated, fingers twisting together. "I’m not really tired yet, and you’ve got luggage. Mind if I tag along to your room for a bit?"

Lucien didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he studied her, his gaze heavy with unspoken meaning. Heat crept up her neck, and she looked away, suddenly fascinated by the carpet.

"Of course," he finally said.

Vanessa trailed behind him into the elevator, her pulse quickening as the numbers climbed. She knew she shouldn’t—this wasn’t proper—but curiosity gnawed at her. She had to see what the top floor looked like.

Ding. The doors slid open. Lucien didn’t move. "Vanessa?"

She blinked, snapping out of her daze. "We’re here?"

With an amused smile, he stepped out, and she hurried after him.

This floor was nothing like the one below. Fewer doors, wider hallways. Lucien swiped his keycard, and the door clicked open. Vanessa slipped in behind him, then froze as he moved aside, revealing the room beyond.

Her breath caught.

Floor-to-ceiling windows framed a panoramic view of the city—emerald treetops merging with sapphire ocean, the horizon bleeding into a sky so vast it felt divine. It was like standing at the edge of heaven.

The suite itself was a masterpiece. Plush leather sofas, a gleaming wet bar, a wine cabinet stocked with vintages she couldn’t pronounce. The living area alone dwarfed her entire room.

She swallowed hard, fingers curling into her palms. She wanted to explore further—needed to—but propriety held her back.

"Aren’t you going to look around?" Lucien’s voice was low, teasing.

Vanessa shook her head, though every fiber of her being screamed to stay. "No, I—I just wanted a peek. I should go."

But her feet refused to move. The thought of returning to her cramped, ordinary room made her chest tighten. She drifted toward the windows, pretending, just for a moment, that this was hers. That she belonged here.

Then warm hands settled on her waist. Lucien’s breath ghosted over her ear as he pulled her against him, his arms wrapping around her shoulders.
###Chapter 115

Vanessa's body froze instantly. She instinctively tried to pull away, but Lucien's voice slithered into her ears like honeyed poison.

"Do you enjoy being here?"

His tone carried an odd lilt that sent shivers down her spine. It reminded her sharply of who he was—a man she couldn't afford to cross.

She stiffened, forcing herself to remain still in his grasp. Her neck felt rigid as she nodded. "O-Of course, I do."

His fingers traced idle patterns along her wrist. "And would you like... to have it all?"

This time, her answer came quicker, smoother. "Yes. Absolutely."

What a dream that would be.

Her entire life had been a relentless climb toward the glittering heights of high society—wealth, luxury, adoration. No more pain, no more struggle. Just the effortless privilege of being someone important.

Dominic had been her golden ticket. A promising investment, one she had watched grow as DR Holdings expanded, collecting accolades and influence. Even when he was still entangled with Evelyn, Vanessa had held the upper hand. She had played her cards right, securing her place as Mrs. Reeves. Everything had been falling perfectly into place.

Then the essential oils scandal struck.

It was a brutal awakening.

DR Holdings, for all its success, was still fragile. One misstep, and the empire could crumble. Unlike the true titans of industry—the Celestia Groups of the world—they lacked the unshakable foundation of old money and power.

And Dominic?

Every time trouble arose, he turned to Evelyn. Or his mother. But now, with his mother out of the picture, what did that leave him?

What did that leave her?

Vanessa used to dream of the future with greedy anticipation. Now, she barely dared to imagine it.

The truth was undeniable—she and Dominic would never truly belong to the elite. The divide was too vast, too deep. No amount of ambition could bridge the chasm between them and the real aristocracy.

Lucien's grip tightened slightly, his breath warm against her ear.

"Then let me show you what real power looks like."
###Chapter 116

Vanessa stood frozen, completely taken aback by Lucien's unexpected reaction. Her eyes followed him as he turned away, striding toward the refrigerator with effortless confidence.

He grabbed a chilled beer, cracked it open with a sharp snap, and took a long, deliberate sip.

Rolling his eyes, as if reconsidering his words, he shrugged. "You need to loosen up, Vanessa. I didn’t peg you as the uptight type."

His tone was light, almost teasing. "We’re here to enjoy ourselves. If you’re happy, I’m happy. I can give you everything you want, and you can give me what I want. Simple, right? Why complicate things?"

Lucien’s nonchalance stung. He acted as if her rejection meant nothing, while Vanessa felt her cheeks burn with embarrassment.

"Relax," he added, waving a dismissive hand. "I don’t force people. If you’re not into it, no hard feelings."

He took another sip of beer. "I’m gonna rest now."

His casual dismissal made her feel foolish—like she was overreacting. But she had already said no, and pride wouldn’t let her backtrack now.

Her mind raced, flustered and uncertain. "Right. I’ll… see you tonight, Mr. Dubois."

She ducked her head and hurried toward the door, her pulse erratic.

Just as her fingers brushed the handle, Lucien’s voice stopped her.

"Vanessa."

She froze.

He smirked, swirling his beer. "We’ve got a whole week in Silverpine Valley. Plenty of time for you to reconsider."

Her breath hitched. She managed a barely audible "Mm," before slipping out and shutting the door behind her.

Inside the suite, Lucien’s smirk deepened.

Vanessa barely remembered the walk back to her room. Her thoughts spiraled—Lucien’s scent, his warmth, his words—all of it suffocated her.

I can’t do this. I won’t betray Dominic. Not now, not ever.

Dominic wanted to marry her. Their relationship was real. Lucien? He just wanted a fling.

Her phone buzzed. Dominic’s name flashed on the screen.

She answered instantly, her voice trembling. "I miss you so much."

Dominic chuckled, surprised. "You just left, sweetheart. Already lonely?"

Her fingers tightened around the phone. "I was just thinking… when will you join me?"

"Vanessa, you know I’ve got things to wrap up here," he said gently. "But soon. Once everything’s settled, I’ll be there."

He softened his tone. "Did you check into the hotel? I booked you the best suite—nothing but the best for my girl. You like it?"
###Chapter 117

Vanessa took another glance around the room, but her mind kept drifting to Lucien’s lavish suite. She inhaled sharply before muttering, "It's... fine."

Dominic frowned. "Just 'fine'? You know the price difference is substantial."

"It’s not that different from the others," Vanessa replied dismissively, eager to drop the subject.

Dominic didn’t pick up on her irritation. "Vanessa, our room is hundreds of dors more expensive. We’re doing well, but DR Holdings is in a critical phase. Every penny counts—new hires, market expansion—we have to be strategic. It’s tough now, but for the future—"

"The future?!" Vanessa snapped, her patience snapping like a brittle twig. "You always talk about the future, Dominic! What about now? The present? You dangle this grand vision in front of me like it’s some unattainable dream. I can’t see it! I just can’t!" Tears spilled down her cheeks, hot and unchecked.

Dominic fell silent, stunned. Vanessa had never lashed out like this before. "Vanessa?" he ventured cautiously. "Are you upset?"

"Yes!" she bit out.

"Is it because of me?" He hesitated. "Or did Lucien do something?"

The mention of Lucien sent a guilty pang through her. "That’s your first thought?" she hissed. "Always jumping to conclusions! Let me tell you why I’m furious—I saw Evelyn!"

"E-Evelyn?" Dominic stiffened. "She’s in Silverpine Valley?"

"Not just here," Vanessa seethed. "She flew first class, got VIP treatment, and was whisked away in a half-million-dor Rolls-Royce! Do you hear me, Dominic? Lucien and I got a lousy Mercedes, but Evelyn? A Rolls!" The words tumbled out, her rage simmering into something colder.

Dominic was speechless. This was beyond anything he’d imagined. "Vanessa, I had no idea—"

"Of course you didn’t!" she spat. "After everything she did, she’s living like royalty. Why? I’ll make sure she pays for it."

"What are you planning?"

"She’ll be at the sampling session. I’ll humiliate her."

Dominic’s voice turned urgent. "Don’t act rashly. We need to assess the situation. Evelyn’s under Phoenix Labs’ protection now. She doesn’t answer to me anymore. You—"

"Feeling sorry for her, Dominic?"

"What? No!" he denied instantly. "You’re the only one I care about. Evelyn means nothing. She—"

"Enough. Handle the essential oil issue. I’ll give you good news soon." Without waiting for a reply, she ended the call.

"Vanessa? Vanessa!" His protests were met with silence.
###Chapter 118

Dominic Reeves called repeatedly, each unanswered ring deepening his frustration.

Had Evelyn Carter gone to Silverpine Valley too?

Vanessa Blake's words echoed in his mind, stirring doubt. First-class flights? A Summit Trailhawk? Since when was Phoenix Labs so generous?

And did Celestia Group really have the resources to pour into such a small subsidiary?

"Mr. Reeves!" A lab technician approached, beaming. "The new formula is finalized—identical to the original."

"Are you certain?" Dominic's excitement flickered, quickly tempered by caution. "Tested thoroughly? There can't be the slightest variation."

It was both a blessing and a curse. Evelyn's perfume held an inexplicable allure, creating fiercely loyal customers who rejected even minor deviations. That was why this crisis had spiraled.

He needed perfection—no room for error before mass production.

The technician hesitated briefly before nodding. "Exactly the same. No difference at all."

"Good." Relief loosened Dominic's shoulders. He followed the technician to inspect the sample—a small vial beside testing strips. Leaning in, he inhaled. The familiar scent smoothed the tension from his brow.

"Send it to production immediately. Overtime shifts—I want this backlog cleared overnight." He paused, reconsidering. "No, I'll deliver it myself."

The stakes were too high to delegate. "And mobilize more staff. Once this is done, bonuses and vacations for everyone."

"Thank you, Mr. Reeves!" The technician hurried off, morale lifted.

Dominic turned to leave but halted. "Wait—is Isabella still out?"

"On personal leave," the technician answered, scratching his head.

"Again?" Dominic's jaw tightened. Isabella Thornton's performance had plummeted since Evelyn's departure.

"She didn't elaborate. Just said it was urgent."

Dominic dismissed him with a wave.

Personal leave? Unapproved, no doubt. Her disregard for protocol was becoming intolerable.

He'd been too swamped to address it earlier, but now? Now, he'd make time.

First, the essential oils to the factory. Then, a detour to Isabella's apartment. Employee records had her address—a modest two-bedroom in Willowbrook Apartments, shared with her mother since her father's passing.

At her door, Dominic pressed the bell. Once. Twice. Then a rapid trio of rings.

Footsteps shuffled inside. A yawn. "Who is it?"

Fingers brushed the knob, but Isabella hesitated. Peering through the peephole, her breath hitched.

Dominic Reeves?

Sleep fled in an instant.
###Chapter 119

"Mr. Reeves?" Evelyn blinked, trying to clear her foggy head. "Why are you at my house?"

"I heard you were on leave. As your boss, shouldn’t I check on my employees?" Dominic’s voice was smooth, knowing she was peering through the peephole. He leaned closer, his face suddenly filling the narrow view.

Evelyn stumbled back, startled. "You—!"

"Evelyn," he said, amusement lacing his tone. "Are you really going to leave me standing out here?"

"Mr. Reeves, I’m sick. And alone. It’s not a good time." She had no intention of opening the door—or engaging further.

This visit was unnecessary. Everything between them had already been said.

Thankfully, her mother had gone grocery shopping. Otherwise—

Speak of the devil.

"Who are you?" A voice rang out from the hallway.

Evelyn’s stomach dropped.

Mom.

"Good afternoon," Dominic replied smoothly. "I’m Evelyn’s employer. Dominic Reeves, CEO of DR Holdings."

"Oh! Mr. Reeves!" Her mother’s voice brightened instantly. "Why are you waiting out here? Evelyn’s home—she must’ve dozed off and didn’t hear you knock. Let me get the door!"

Evelyn had no choice. She darted back to her room, shutting the door just as the front door swung open.

"Please, come in!" Her mother ushered him inside, setting down her grocery bags. "Evelyn! Evelyn! Your boss is here!"

Silence.

Her mother turned to Dominic with an apologetic smile. "She must be sleeping deeply. Let me try again."

"Strange," Dominic mused, settling onto the sofa. "I could’ve sworn I heard her speaking earlier."

Damn him.

Evelyn knew the act was up. She quickly changed into presentable clothes and stepped out.

"Mom."

"Sweetheart, Mr. Reeves is here!" Her mother winked meaningfully before bustling off to make tea.

Evelyn approached reluctantly, arms crossed. She didn’t sit.

Dominic stretched his legs, tilting his head up at her with a faint smirk. "Evelyn, you’ve been taking quite a few sick days lately. Everything alright?"

Her mother returned with a tray, overhearing. "Oh? She’s perfectly healthy!"

"Really?" Dominic feigned surprise. "She’s been absent frequently. I was concerned."

Frequent sick leave?

Her mother’s eyes widened. She turned to Evelyn. "What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"

"Mom, I’m fine," Evelyn muttered, frowning.

Work drama wasn’t something her mother needed to worry about. That’s why Evelyn had been spending her "sick" days wandering the city, burning through her savings.

At this rate, she’d be fired within the month.

And honestly? She couldn’t wait.
###Chapter 120

Dominic Reeves unexpectedly strode toward the door.

“What do you mean, you’re fine?” Sophia’s mother raised her hand and smacked her arm. “You don’t look fine. I thought you were on leave, but here you are, lazing around! What were you planning to do, lying around like this instead of going to work?”

Her mother punctuated each word with another light smack. Sophia didn’t dodge, only sighing in exasperation. “Mom, don’t worry about it. Just go run your errands.”

“It’s not about bossing you around—it’s about responsibility! Even your boss had to come looking for you! Now tell me, when are you going to pull yourself together?”

“Mom…” Sophia groaned, thoroughly defeated.

Dominic lingered at the doorway, watching the scene unfold like some twisted comedy.

He waited until Sophia had endured a few more maternal reprimands before clearing his throat. “Mrs. Grant, I believe Sophia might have her reasons. There’s no need to scold her. I’m not here to reprimand her—just to check if she’s unwell or facing any difficulties.”

“Mr. Reeves,” Sophia cut in sharply, her patience fraying, “if you have something to say, let’s talk outside.”

She had underestimated him. He was far more underhanded than she’d imagined—showing up at her home and using her mother to pressure her.

But he’d gotten what he wanted.

Dominic spread his hands in mock surrender. “Of course. Why not?”

Sophia’s mother had just set down the teapot, frowning at her daughter’s tone. “Mr. Reeves, I’ve spoiled Sophia a bit. She can be stubborn, but she’s a good girl. If she’s slacking at work, please discipline her. She needs this job!”

“Mom, stop,” Sophia hissed, pressing her fingers to her temples. This was spiraling out of control.

Her mother shot her a look, clearly thinking Sophia didn’t appreciate her efforts.

Dominic, ever the charmer, smiled smoothly. “Don’t worry. Sophia is valuable to DR Holdings, and we value her just as much.”

“Good!” Her mother nodded vigorously before nudging Sophia. “Quick, thank Mr.—” She faltered, blanking on his name.

“Mr. Reeves,” Sophia gritted out, already at the door. “Let’s go.”

Her mother leaned in as Sophia passed, whispering, “Be nice.”

Sophia barely resisted rolling her eyes.

They ended up at the café downstairs. Dominic ordered two coffees, but Sophia had no intention of drinking hers.

“Mr. Reeves,” she said coldly, “what’s the real reason you came to my house?”

He took a leisurely sip before answering. “Just checking on my employee.”

“Cut the act. I know what you want. But I don’t know Evelyn’s formula. Every perfumer guards their secrets—she wouldn’t share them with me. I was just her assistant. Why would she trust me now?”

Dominic listened, unfazed, his expression unreadable.

When she finished, he nodded. “You’re right. But I didn’t come for formulas. Did you really think DR Holdings would crumble without Evelyn? That we wouldn’t uncover her little tricks? You overestimated her.”

Sophia stiffened. Had they already solved the crisis?

She hadn’t been to the office in days—was she already obsolete?
###Chapter 121

Dominic noticed Evelyn's confused expression and immediately understood her thoughts. A smug grin spread across his face.

"You don't believe me?" He leaned forward, his voice dripping with condescension. "Go back to DR Holdings and ask around if you doubt me. Don’t be naive, Evelyn. You can’t win against someone with more power than you."

His tone sharpened. "What exactly has Evelyn ever done for you? Has she ever truly cared? Do you even know where she is right now? She boarded a first-class flight and was whisked away in a Rolls-Royce. Meanwhile, you’re stuck in some rundown apartment with your mother, throwing tantrums and skipping work."

Dominic scoffed. "How long will your savings last? A year? Maybe five months if you stretch it? Have you even thought about what comes after? Your contract expires in two years—until then, you’re mine. Resignation isn’t an option unless you can pay the penalty."

His smirk widened. "Do you really think you can challenge me, Evelyn?"

He reclined in his chair, radiating arrogance, as if victory was already his. Evelyn kept her head down, silent.

Dominic mistook her silence for surrender. His satisfaction deepened.

"I’ve been more than patient with you," he continued. "Think about all the trouble you’ve caused lately. Do you think any other employer would tolerate this? And why are you even interfering? My relationship with Evelyn is none of your concern. Stay in your lane."

With a dramatic flourish, he slid an envelope across the desk.

"Consider this a bonus for your recent efforts." His voice was laced with sarcasm. "Take it, clear your head, and get back to work. DR Holdings will move forward—grudges are beneath us."

Evelyn finally lifted her gaze. Her fingers pressed down on the envelope, but she didn’t take it.

"I’ll do my job," she said quietly. "But I won’t take your money."

She pushed it back. Dominic’s smile vanished. His brows furrowed. "What’s your game?"

Evelyn met his eyes. "Since you asked—fine, I’ll be blunt. You won’t let me leave, and I can’t afford the penalty, so I’ll stay. Yes, you have power and money. I can’t fight you on that. But I will work on my terms. And if you withhold my salary or try to sabotage me, I’ll sue you."

She stood, her voice steady. "If you want to play this game, Dominic, then let’s play."

She turned to leave.

Dominic shot to his feet. "Why are you doing this?!"

Evelyn paused but didn’t face him.

"How long have you even known Evelyn? What has she really done for you? Vanessa and I grew up with her. What loyalty do you owe her? What’s in it for you?"

His voice dripped with contempt.

Loyalty? Principles? Pathetic. In this world, only profit matters.

Evelyn finally turned back. "It doesn’t matter how she treated me. What matters is how you repaid her."

Her gaze hardened. "Everyone else might be blind, but I know the truth. Evelyn stood by you. She worked tirelessly for you. And what did she get in return? Betrayal. You threw her to the wolves and stole everything she built. Why would I ever respect someone like you?"

Dominic’s jaw clenched at the disdain in her eyes. It ignited his fury.

"Fine!" He shoved past her. "If you’re so determined to go down with Evelyn, then I’ll bury you both!"

He stormed out, leaving Evelyn gripping a chair for balance.

She had agreed to return to work for one reason: Dominic was right about one thing. She couldn’t afford to lose her job. If DR Holdings collapsed over the essential oil scandal, her contract would be void.

But Evelyn understood his game now.

The fact that he’d already resolved the crisis explained his arrogance.

This wasn’t over.
###Chapter 122

If Sophia kept up her act, she'd soon find herself penniless.

No salary meant drowning in debts—rent, utilities, and all the other relentless bills.

Money was the lifeline. Without it, existence turned bleak.

Sophia marched back to work like nothing had happened.

If Dominic dared dock her pay, she’d drag him to court.

Besides, she needed to witness how they’d handle the fallout. She knew the inner workings of DR Holdings better than most.

Dominic wouldn’t keep dead weight. His ruthlessness was legendary.

The perfumery world was insular. True talent? Rarer than a blue moon.

That’s why DR Holdings clung to Evelyn like ivy to a wall.

Was Vanessa equally gifted? The question gnawed at her.

At The Chateau Royale, the clock struck six.

Vanessa had just ended a tearful call with Dominic. Exhaustion pulled her under, but she jolted awake hours later, disoriented.

She rushed to shower, then meticulously prepped for the evening’s agenda.

Vanessa understood her weapons: delicate features, a honeyed voice, and curves she knew how to accentuate. Her eyes—half-lidded, languid—could melt glaciers.

Tears left their cruel marks. Puffy eyes wouldn’t do.

With a sigh, she wiped away ruined eyeshadow and reapplied it darker. Contour powder became her ally, sculpting away the swelling until her reflection gleamed flawless.

Lipstick came next. Two swipes, then—

A violent twist in her gut.

She barely stifled a gag, slapping a hand over her mouth as she bolted to the bathroom.

The retching yielded little—mostly bile—but the nausea clung like tar.

Catching her breath, she pressed a palm to her lower abdomen. The suspicion crystallized: Pregnant.

The realization was a cocktail of emotions—neither sweet nor bitter, but fizzy with uncertainty.

Dominic would marry her if she carried his heir. Mrs. Reeves—the title should’ve thrilled her.

Yet the fantasy, now within reach, felt... hollow.

Evelyn’s indifference haunted her. All these years battling, and her rival cared more for accolades than Dominic.

Vanessa’s future, once a gilded path, now seemed strewn with thorns.

Dominic’s ascent to the elite? A pipe dream.

Will I ever know true luxury? she wondered, fingers digging into her stomach. Or is this all just a house of cards?

Her heart sank like a stone.
###Chapter 123

Vanessa prepared meticulously, but her phone remained stubbornly silent. No calls from Lucien.

Something felt wrong. The absence of his usual punctual reminder sent alarm bells ringing through her mind. Without hesitation, she marched toward Lucien's suite.

The doorbell echoed through the empty hallway. One minute. Two. Still no response.

A hotel attendant appeared, drawn by the persistent ringing. "May I assist you, miss?"

"I need to find Mr. Dubois. He's not answering." Her fingers twisted the strap of her purse. "I fear something's happened to him."

The attendant's polite smile didn't reach his eyes. "Mr. Dubois departed approximately thirty minutes ago."

"What?" The word exploded from her lips. "That's impossible! We had plans—"

Then realization struck like lightning. Her stomach dropped.

Had her rejection last night caused this? No, he'd promised not to pressure her. Unless... Was this his revenge? A cold lesson about refusing him?

Her trembling fingers dialed his number. Straight to voicemail.

The message was clear. No favors without compliance.

Vanessa's jaw clenched. With time slipping away, she hailed a taxi, her designer heels clicking angrily against the marble floor.

"That's what you're wearing?" Victoria's critical gaze swept over Evelyn's simple ensemble.

Evelyn glanced down at her modest dress. "Is there an issue?"

"An issue?" Victoria threw her hands up. "We're representing DR Holdings! You look like you're going to a library, not a gala!"

Evelyn's cheeks burned. "I didn't pack formal wear. It's just a one-day event—"

"Unacceptable." Victoria rummaged through her luggage, producing a sleek ebony gown. "Here. Wear this."

The off-shoulder design shimmered under the lights. Evelyn hesitated. "Your dress? I couldn't—"

"Just try it." Victoria thrust the fabric into her hands. "We're similar sizes."

The transformation was startling. The dress hugged Evelyn's curves perfectly, the dark fabric making her porcelain skin glow. The slit revealed just enough leg to be elegant, not provocative.

Victoria whistled. "Now that's a Celestia Group executive. Stunning."

Evelyn's fingers fluttered to her collarbone. "It's... much fancier than I'm used to."

Since becoming Dominic's wife, she'd avoided these glittering affairs, preferring quiet evenings to flashing cameras. Simplicity had become her armor.

"Get used to it." Victoria adjusted the neckline with expert fingers. "Consider it a gift. That dress was made for you."

Evelyn shook her head. "I can't accept—"

"Nonsense." Victoria spun her toward the mirror. "Look at yourself. This is who you're meant to be."
###Chapter 124

"Come on, don't be so formal with me. You're nothing like the girl who first walked into Phoenix Labs!"

Victoria Sterling pretended to scowl at Evelyn Carter, shoving the dress toward her. "Just wear it unless you hate it! We're running late—we need to go now."

Evelyn laughed. If they hadn't been in a hurry, she would've asked Victoria to describe exactly how different she was back then.

The same Rolls-Royce from earlier pulled up, and even Victoria froze.

She had been shocked enough seeing it at the airport.

Since when does Phoenix Labs splurge like this? Victoria had traveled extensively for work, but this level of luxury was unheard of. The usual company car was a BMW at best.

Later, she had called Gregory Whitmore to confirm there wasn't some VIP mix-up.

Gregory assured her the company was prioritizing this event—hence the extravagant treatment.

Victoria had assumed the first-class flight and airport pickup were the extent of it.

She never expected the same car would take them to the event.

How much is the company spending on this?

Unlike Victoria's bewilderment, Evelyn remained composed.

This was just another one of Alexander Kensington's little games.

What seemed lavish to Phoenix Labs was pocket change to him.

She had tried calling him earlier, but his phone was off.

Probably in a meeting.

Evelyn blinked, realizing she was thinking about him again.

It hadn't even been a full day, yet he kept slipping into her thoughts.

This quiet longing clung to her like an invisible embrace.

Alexander, I miss you.

"Evelyn, I heard several top perfumers will be at this sampling. Our goal is observation, not pressure. Watch, listen, and speak minimally."

Victoria, ever the seasoned mentor, gave her last-minute advice.

"Got it," Evelyn nodded.

"I'll introduce you to some industry peers later, but don’t take anything personally. Rivalry runs deep in this field. Stay sharp."

Evelyn kept nodding until she suddenly smirked. "Victoria, we're peers too. Does that mean we're rivals?"

Victoria rolled her eyes.

Seeing Evelyn's playful grin, she scoffed. "Please. You’d have to actually be competition first. Not just anyone qualifies."

"Fair point!" Evelyn chuckled.

"Look at you, getting bold now!"

Victoria nudged her, laughing.

It was surreal—just weeks ago, they'd nearly come to blows. Now, they were practically inseparable.

The unpredictability of female friendships.

The event was at The Chateau Royale, Silverpine Valley's most opulent hotel.

Though small-scale, it had drawn a swarm of reporters.

Cameras lined the entrance, capturing every arrival.

Guests stepped out of their cars onto the red carpet, basking in the flashing lights.

But at that moment, Vanessa Blake sat frozen in her car, staring across the street.

She couldn’t bring herself to step out.
###Chapter 125

Vanessa Blake had spent hours perfecting her look—her crimson dress hugged her curves, the hem teasing just above her thighs, and her three-inch heels elongated her already slender legs. Her makeup was flawless, her hair styled to perfection. Yet, despite all the effort, she hesitated at the car door, fingers tightening around her clutch.

DR Holdings was nothing in this sea of industry giants. If only Lucien Dubois were here—his presence alone would have given her an edge. But he had made himself scarce, ignoring every one of her calls.

"Ms. Blake, we're running late," the driver reminded her, voice cautious.

She shot him a glare. "Since when do you dictate my schedule?"

Just as she considered dialing Lucien again, her gaze snagged on a sleek Rolls-Royce gliding toward the hotel entrance. A smirk curled her lips. "Follow them," she ordered. "But keep your distance."

Her car rolled forward, stopping just as the Rolls did. Vanessa stepped out, timing it perfectly—Evelyn Carter was exiting her own vehicle, dressed in an off-the-shoulder black gown, her hair swept into an effortless updo. The dress accentuated her sharp collarbones and graceful neck, exuding understated luxury.

Photographers swarmed, flashes erupting as Evelyn and Victoria Sterling moved toward the red carpet. Vanessa clenched her fists, then forced a bright smile. "Evelyn!"

The cameras swung toward her voice.

Evelyn barely spared her a glance but paused, aware of the press. Vanessa closed the distance, heels clicking sharply against the pavement. "What a surprise seeing you here," she purred. "Phoenix Labs must really value your contributions to send you to an event like this. All that effort jumping ship paid off, didn't it?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a cool smile. "Phoenix Labs has vision. Unlike some companies, they recognize talent." She tilted her head. "But then again, I was never under contract elsewhere, so 'jumping ship' doesn’t quite apply, does it?"

Before Vanessa could retort, Evelyn continued, "Unless you're referring to all those favors I did for DR Holdings over the years? Consider it a parting gift between old classmates. I wouldn’t fuss over a few bottles of perfume."

She turned to Victoria. "The air out here is stale. Let’s go inside."

Victoria smirked, brushing past Vanessa with a look of pure disdain.

Vanessa's nails bit into her palms. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go. She had meant to twist Evelyn’s words for the press, to paint her as ungrateful. Instead, Evelyn had turned it around effortlessly.

And now the cameras were still rolling.
###Chapter 126

Vanessa Blake’s dress was far too tight, and with every step she took, the fabric slid lower, dangerously close to revealing the lace trim of her bra.

Her cheeks burned crimson.

Clutching her purse to her chest, she hurried toward the venue, her heels clicking against the marble floor.

Evelyn Carter, meanwhile, was already exhausted.

She had spent the last hour circling the room, exchanging pleasantries with industry peers Victoria Sterling had introduced her to.

Even before the official sampling event began, she was drained.

Socializing was infinitely more exhausting than formulating fragrances.

She retreated to a quiet corner, balancing a small plate of hors d'oeuvres in one hand.

All she wanted was to glimpse the new creations from the masters of the craft—then leave.

Victoria, on the other hand, was in her element.

This wasn’t her first industry event, and she navigated the crowd with effortless grace.

When she turned to look for Evelyn, she found her missing.

It took her a moment to spot her tucked away in the corner, nibbling on a canapé.

Victoria stifled a laugh.

"I brought you here to network, not to raid the buffet," she teased, rolling her eyes as she plucked a flute of champagne from a passing waiter’s tray.

She handed it to Evelyn. "At least hydrate. Those pastries look dry."

"The food is incredible," Evelyn countered, sipping the champagne with a small smile. "You should try some."

"Unlike you, I have self-control," Victoria shot back, though her tone lacked any real bite.

Her opinion of Evelyn had shifted.

She wasn’t the pretentious upstart Victoria had initially assumed.

She was talented, yes—but without the arrogance that usually came with it.

Victoria had misjudged her.

"That woman earlier—Vanessa Blake from DR Holdings," Victoria said, settling beside Evelyn. "She’s the one suing you, isn’t she?"

Evelyn nodded. "I thought you knew her."

"I’ve probably seen her at events, but she’s forgettable."

Victoria tilted her head, considering.

Phoenix Labs and DR Holdings had crossed paths at numerous competitions.

She recognized Dominic Reeves, of course—but Vanessa?

She was always trailing behind him, a shadow rather than a presence.

There were a few DR Holdings fragrances Victoria admired—complex, innovative.

But meeting Vanessa in person?

Nothing about her suggested the mind behind those creations.

Something felt off.

"She stole your work," Victoria said, her lip curling in disgust. "Took credit for your formulas, then had the audacity to sue you. How are you not furious?"

Evelyn set her plate down, her expression turning serious.

"Who says I’m not?"
###Chapter 127

Evelyn froze momentarily.
Her gaze swept over Victoria with careful consideration. "Honestly, if you were upset, I couldn't detect it."

Victoria let out a dry chuckle. "Emotions aren't meant to be billboards. We're representing Celestia Group at this prestigious gathering. Why would I waste my expressions on someone like her? I'm not deranged."

A burst of laughter escaped Evelyn at the remark.

"Anger is counterproductive anyway. Remember what they say - vengeance matures best when chilled. I'm in no rush for retribution. Let's see who has the last laugh," Evelyn mused with icy composure.

Victoria nodded slowly, her respect for Evelyn deepening with each revelation.

"There's something I've been meaning to ask," Victoria ventured hesitantly.

The question clearly weighed on her.

Evelyn arched an elegant brow. "Go ahead."

She'd come to regard Victoria as a genuine ally. Their rocky start stemmed from natural suspicion toward newcomers, especially after past betrayals.

But Victoria's blunt honesty was refreshing compared to the venomous smiles of social climbers.

Before Victoria could voice her question, the grand hall's chandeliers dimmed dramatically.

"Ladies and gentlemen!" A booming voice echoed through the sound system.

The product showcase had begun.

Victoria's inquiry was forgotten as both women turned toward the illuminated stage, joining the polite applause.

"What an honor to host so many distinguished guests tonight," the emcee continued.

As the presentation commenced, Vanessa wove through the glittering crowd, champagne flute in hand, searching desperately for Lucien.

He'd departed before her - he should have arrived ages ago.

Vanessa had lingered outside the venue for nearly twenty minutes, hoping to spot him.

Now inside, she still couldn't locate the French perfumer.

Without Lucien's imposing presence, she might as well have been invisible.

Her attempts at conversation were met with polite disinterest the moment she mentioned DR Holdings.

Yes, DR Holdings held regional prominence. But against international fragrance empires and celebrity noses? They were minnows among sharks.

The humiliation of being overlooked combined with her earlier confrontation with Evelyn created a toxic cocktail of rage.

How different things would be with Lucien beside her.

As spotlights focused on the stage, Vanessa was forced to pause her search. She stood stiffly, ignoring the product demonstrations.

What did she care about others' innovations? No matter how brilliant, these creations would never bear her name.

Her purpose here wasn't inspiration - it was recruitment. DR Holdings needed fresh talent, and she intended to poach the best.
###Chapter 128

The realization struck Vanessa like lightning. She stopped searching for Lucien in the crowded venue.

Even if she found him, would he care? Unless...

Her pulse quickened at the memory of his earlier words.

"No," she reminded herself sharply. "Lucien only wants one thing. Dominic is who truly matters."

On stage, the presenter showcased each fragrance's creator, detailing their inspiration and creative process.

He dissected scent profiles, suggesting which personalities each perfume would complement best.

Occasionally, audience members were invited to share their impressions.

Vanessa shrank in her seat. Not from shyness, but strategy.

The room brimmed with industry elites. One wrong word would make her a laughingstock. Silence was safest.

As she tried blending into the crowd, her gaze locked onto Evelyn instead.

The host had selected Evelyn, unaware of her identity.

"Ms. Carter, you'll be sampling Marcel Beaumont's latest creation," the host announced, referring to the legendary perfumer from Laurentia.

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd.

Everyone coveted this opportunity yet feared the scrutiny that came with critiquing a master's work.

Whispers spread like wildfire. "She's from Phoenix Labs," someone murmured.

Though Phoenix Labs held prestige as a Celestia Group subsidiary, most assumed they'd sent a novice for experience.

"Are you nervous, facing Marcel's masterpiece?" The host's tone was playful.

Evelyn's lips curved. "I believe Master Beaumont bears the greater burden."

The audience erupted in shocked murmurs.

Vanessa's jealous glare transformed into a smirk. 'Fool! Insulting Marcel and every expert here? Who does this nobody think she is?'

The host blinked. "I... beg your pardon?"

Victoria Sterling, Evelyn's manager, shot warning glances from the front row.

Unfazed, Evelyn continued, "Legends like Marcel must patiently endure our amateur analyses. Maintaining composure when hearing nonsensical critiques from juniors like us - that's true pressure."

Her calm delivery contrasted sharply with the growing buzz in the room.
###Chapter 129

The tension in the room dissolved as the audience erupted in laughter.

"You've got quite the wit, Ms. Carter," the host remarked with an amused grin. "While it's true that masters become subjects of study for aspiring perfumers, few truly grasp the depth of their craft. Tell me, how much do you believe you understand about Master Beaumont's work?"

His tone carried a playful challenge, deliberately stirring the atmosphere. The crowd leaned forward, energized by the earlier exchange. The question was deceptively simple yet perilous to answer.

Too bold a claim would seem presumptuous. Too modest would appear insecure.

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile.

"I wouldn't presume to understand a master's essence completely," she began, her voice clear as crystal. "Every perfumer knows our art springs from unique visions. Each creation carries its maker's fingerprint - distinct inspirations, unexpected turns in the creative process."

She gestured gracefully. "Minds are labyrinths. We can never truly walk another's path. What I can share are my personal impressions of Master Beaumont's latest work."

On stage, Evelyn shone like dawn breaking through mist. Her posture radiated quiet assurance, every word measured yet spontaneous. The audience found themselves nodding along, unconsciously captivated.

In the VIP balcony overlooking the event, a man's fingers stilled around his champagne flute, his gaze fixed on the luminous figure below.

The sampling session buzzed with renewed energy as emerging talents took center stage. For novices, this was golden opportunity - to learn, to connect, to be seen.

Vanessa's manicured nails dug into her palms. Each laugh, each flash of camera lights twisted the knife deeper. She'd sacrificed everything to climb this industry's ladder, collecting awards like stepping stones. Yet here she stood - invisible, forgotten.

I should never have come to this circus.

She pivoted sharply toward the exit.

"Madame!" The host's voice cut through the hum. "Yes, you in the crimson gown! The stunning lady by the aisle!"

A spotlight blinded Vanessa. The entire room turned in unison.

Her spine stiffened. For one wild moment, she prayed she'd misheard.

"Would you honor us by joining us on stage?" The host beamed, arm outstretched.

Trapped beneath hundreds of curious stares, retreat was impossible. Vanessa forced her limbs to move, each step heavier than the last. She kept her gaze fixed on some distant point above the crowd, refusing to meet any eyes - especially not hers.

The stage lights burned hotter up close. Vanessa stood rigid, staring straight ahead at nothing, as if by sheer will she could vanish from this nightmare.
###Chapter 130

The spotlight burned bright against Vanessa Blake’s skin as she stood frozen on stage.

"And your name, miss?" The host’s cheerful voice echoed through the grand hall.

Vanessa blinked, her throat dry.

"Hello?"

The host waved a hand in front of her face, his smile faltering.

She snapped back to reality, fingers tightening around the microphone.

"I—"

Her voice cracked.

Clearing her throat, she forced a smile.

Vanessa wasn’t new to attention. Awards, interviews, public appearances—she had handled them all with grace.

But tonight was different.

Her hands were ice. Her legs trembled.

Evelyn Carter was watching.

One mistake, and she’d be humiliated in front of everyone.

She couldn’t let that happen.

"Looks like our guest is a little nervous!" The host chuckled, trying to lighten the mood. "No worries, take your time."

Vanessa cut him off before he could dismiss her.

"Sorry," she said, forcing steadiness into her voice. "Just lost in thought for a second."

She straightened her shoulders.

"Vanessa Blake. Senior perfumer at DR Holdings in Veridian City."

The words came out smoother than she expected.

At least she hadn’t completely fallen apart.

The host grinned. "Ah, Ms. Blake! What a lovely voice. And if I recall, Ms. Carter is also from Veridian City. Seems like your city breeds both talent and beauty!"

Laughter rippled through the crowd.

Vanessa’s gaze flicked toward Evelyn, who sat poised in the front row.

She smiled tightly.

"Yes. Ms. Carter and I went to the same school."

The host nodded enthusiastically. "Wonderful! Now, Ms. Carter’s review was exceptional, so I’m sure Ms. Blake won’t disappoint either."

He turned to the audience.

"Next up, we have a fragrance from another rising star in perfumery. Young, but already a two-time international award winner—and he’s here with us tonight!"

Vanessa’s stomach dropped.

She had planned to improvise—throw around some vague, flattering descriptions. No one would question her too closely.

But the creator was here.

If she got it wrong, she’d be exposed in front of everyone.

Her pulse roared in her ears.

She wanted to run.

But her feet refused to move.

The host laughed. "Don’t worry, Ms. Blake! The creator is very approachable. Let’s take a look at the fragrance first, and then we’ll bring him out, alright?"

Vanessa couldn’t speak.

A staff member placed the perfume bottle on the table in front of her.

It might as well have been a live grenade.

"Whenever you’re ready, Ms. Blake."

She reached for it with numb fingers.

The room blurred.

She could already hear the whispers, the laughter, the pity.

There was no escape.
###Chapter 131

The spotlight burned hot against Vanessa's skin.

Every eye in the audience was fixed on her, waiting. She couldn’t back down now—not with the cameras rolling, not with the whispers already beginning.

She forced herself to focus.

This wasn’t just about identifying a scent. It was about precision, about not making a fool of herself on live television. One wrong word, one misstep, and the internet would never let her forget it.

Her fingers trembled as she held the test strip.

She inhaled deeply, letting the fragrance settle on her senses. Light. Elegant. Something floral, but not overpowering.

She had to say something.

"Ms. Blake?" The host’s voice cut through her thoughts.

Vanessa straightened. "I adore this fragrance," she said, her voice steady despite the racing of her heart. "It’s the kind of scent that belongs in a quiet garden at dawn—soft, serene, untouched by noise."

She hesitated. Was she right?

"There’s a hint of chrysanthemum, isn’t there?" she ventured. "Perhaps an essential oil derived from dried petals?"

The words sounded uncertain even to her own ears.

The host paused, and Vanessa’s pulse spiked.

Then—relief. "I can’t confirm the ingredients," the host said with a smile, "but Ms. Blake’s description certainly makes it sound enchanting! Why don’t we bring the creator out and let him settle this?"

Vanessa barely had time to brace herself before the crowd erupted in applause.

She didn’t dare look.

Instead, she kept her smile fixed, her posture perfect. Whatever happened next, she wouldn’t falter.

"Please welcome the mastermind behind this fragrance—Mr. Lucien Dubois!"

Vanessa’s breath caught.

She turned—and there he was.

Lucien.

His familiar smirk sent a jolt through her.

He took the microphone, his voice smooth as he addressed the audience. "First, my thanks to the organizers for this honor. Though I was raised in Laurentia, the artistry of Veridian perfumery has always inspired me."

His gaze flicked to Vanessa.

"This scent," he continued, "was born from a memory. A quiet moment shared with someone who understood beauty in stillness."

A pause.

Then, with a slow smile—"And yes, Ms. Blake, you were absolutely right."

He stepped forward, took her hand, and lifted it to his lips.

His blue eyes locked onto hers.

"Thank you," he murmured, just for her, "for seeing what others missed."
###Chapter 132

His fingers brushed against hers as he lifted her hand, pressing a lingering kiss to the back of it.

The audience erupted into thunderous applause.

Vanessa snatched her hand away the moment his lips left her skin. To everyone else, it had been nothing more than a chivalrous gesture—Lucien Dubois paying homage to a fellow perfumer. But she had felt it. The fleeting, deliberate swipe of his tongue against her skin before he released her.

The spot burned.

It tingled like the rough lick of a cat’s tongue, sending an unexpected shiver down her spine. Her pulse stuttered, betraying her.

Vanessa ducked her head, cheeks flushing crimson. She forced a demure smile, playing the part of a woman overwhelmed by praise.

Only Evelyn Carter saw through it.

From her seat near the back, Evelyn’s sharp gaze narrowed. She was too far to catch the exact moment, but Vanessa’s reaction wasn’t from mere flattery. Vanessa Blake didn’t blush at compliments—she thrived on them.

Something else had happened.

On stage, the host beamed at the pair. “What a remarkable display of mutual admiration! Mr. Dubois and Ms. Blake clearly share a rare creative kinship. Tonight’s event proves that our local talent rivals even the most esteemed international perfumers. Together, we’ll lead this industry into a dazzling new era!”

Evelyn nudged Victoria beside her. “We’re leaving.”

Victoria frowned, still staring at the stage. “Don’t you think it’s weird? They’re acting like strangers.”

Evelyn followed her gaze. Lucien and Vanessa now stood a careful distance apart, their body language stiff, their smiles polite. Strangers.

But they weren’t.

“We saw them together on the flight here,” Victoria muttered, crossing her arms. “Now suddenly, they’re all formal? Please. That man’s no legendary perfumer—just another fraud propping her up.”

Evelyn’s lips curved. Interesting.

Vanessa had arrived without Dominic. And now, she and Lucien were pretending they’d never met.

A calculated performance.

Evelyn rose, smoothing her dress. “Let’s go. We’ve got sightseeing tomorrow.”

As she turned toward the exit, something nagged at her. She glanced back at the stage.

Empty.

Just abandoned tables and the lingering scent of deceit.
###Chapter 133

The day had been nothing short of chaotic for Vanessa, a whirlwind of emotions and unexpected turns. One moment, she felt herself teetering on the edge of an abyss, and the next, Lucien Dubois appeared like a storm, his hand reaching out to pull her back from the brink.

On the ride back to The Chateau Royale, her mind was a tangled mess. She didn’t even protest when Lucien’s fingers curled around hers, his grip firm and unyielding. The silence between them was thick, charged with something restless, something electric.

When they reached the lobby, Lucien guided her into the elevator. The moment the doors slid shut, he pinned her against the wall, his body caging her in.

"Mr. Dubois!" Vanessa gasped, her pulse skyrocketing.

His lips curved into a smirk. "Vanessa, I just did you a massive favor today. Don’t you think you owe me a little gratitude?" His hand slid to the back of her head, fingers tangling in her hair.

"I—" She barely had time to form a protest before his mouth crashed into hers. The kiss was relentless, stealing her breath, her thoughts, any chance of resistance. Her palms pressed weakly against his chest, but it was futile.

Ding.

The elevator chimed, the doors opening on her floor. Lucien pulled back instantly, putting just enough space between them to let her glimpse the hallway beyond.

Vanessa didn’t hesitate. She bolted out, her heart hammering.

But his voice stopped her cold.

"Vanessa." His tone was low, dangerous. "I’m not a patient man. I’ve given you chances—more than you deserve. But even my generosity has limits. Tonight is your last opportunity. Do you understand?"

She didn’t dare turn around. Not until the elevator doors closed again, swallowing him whole.

But even then, his absence didn’t bring relief. The ghost of his lips still burned against hers, a reminder of what had just happened—what could happen if she gave in.

And yet, his words echoed louder.

Lucien Dubois wasn’t making empty threats. He had the power to ruin her—or elevate her to heights she’d only dreamed of. If she refused him now, there would be no second chances.

Her fingers trembled as they brushed over her stomach.

What was she supposed to do?

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Victoria were returning to their suite when Victoria’s phone buzzed.

"What? Now? Where are they?" She shot Evelyn a glance. "Can’t Evelyn and I handle this together?"
###Chapter 134

Evelyn questioned herself silently, but Victoria wasn’t looking at her—her full attention was on the call. Victoria nodded sharply. "Understood. Don’t worry, I’ll be there immediately!"

As she hung up, Evelyn frowned. "What’s wrong? Do you need to leave?"

"Yes. A new batch of ingredients just arrived, and I need to inspect them." Victoria offered an apologetic smile.

"Then I’ll come with you," Evelyn insisted.

Victoria shook her head. "The team specifically asked for me alone. It’s not about trust—probably just a client’s odd request. You know how some of them are with their protocols." She sighed. "I’ll just review the materials, sign a few documents, and be back before you know it. The driver’s waiting."

Evelyn hesitated. "It’s late. I don’t like you going alone."

Victoria laughed, ruffling Evelyn’s hair. "Oh, come on. I’ve handled worse on my own. This is the first time someone’s actually worried about me. It’s sweet, but unnecessary. I’ll be fine."

Evelyn exhaled. "Fine. But keep your phone charged. Call me if anything feels off. You never know who you might run into."

"Got it." Victoria handed her the room key. "Go rest. We’ve got a full day tomorrow."

Evelyn took the key and stepped out at the lobby, watching the car disappear into the night. Victoria was experienced—this was routine. Nothing would go wrong.

Or so she thought.

Back in the suite, Evelyn swiped her keycard and reached for the lights—when strong arms wrapped around her from behind.

"Who—?!" Instinct kicked in. She drove her heel down, aiming for a foot, and twisted to slam an elbow back. But the man dodged effortlessly.

"Evelyn."

Her breath caught. That voice—deep, familiar, achingly missed. She pulled the strike at the last second. "Alexander?!" She whirled, heart pounding. Was she imagining him?

He didn’t give her time to doubt. "I missed you," he said simply, pulling her flush against him. In one smooth motion, he guided her inside and flicked the lights on.

The second she saw his face—those sharp features, the warmth in his gaze—her chest tightened with joy. His lips curved, reading her expression perfectly.

Then she surprised him.

Evelyn grabbed his collar, yanked him down, and whispered against his mouth, "I missed you too."

Before he could react, she kissed him—hard.

Alexander stiffened in shock. This was new. His wife, usually so reserved, was claiming him with a fierceness that sent heat straight to his core.

When he recovered, he kissed her back like a man starved.
###Chapter 135

Being wrapped in Alexander Kensington's arms was pure bliss. Evelyn Carter tilted her head up to meet his gaze. "When did you arrive?"

Alexander pressed a soft kiss to her forehead. "Guess."

Now he wants to play games. Evelyn smirked before answering, "You left the same day we did, didn't you? Even though we got here first, you weren’t far behind."

Alexander chuckled, brushing his lips against her cheek. "Clever girl."

"That’s because I tried calling you, but your phone was off. You never turn it off—not even during meetings. I figured you must’ve been on a flight." As Evelyn pieced together the details, she realized the truth. Still, it never crossed her mind that Alexander had rushed here just to see her.

"Impressive. Should I reward you for being so sharp?" His smirk was playful, but the warmth in his eyes made her heart flutter. He scooped her up effortlessly, settling onto the sofa with her nestled in his lap. The weight of her against him felt right, as if she belonged there.

Evelyn looped her arms around his neck to steady herself. "So, you were the one who arranged the first-class flight and the Rolls-Royce?"

"Mhm." He didn’t deny it.

"And you were the client Victoria mentioned on the phone?" Her voice rose slightly in accusation.

"Guilty."

"You shouldn’t abuse your power like that!" She swatted his chest lightly. "It’s the middle of the night. You can’t just send Victoria out to meet a client this late. What if something happened to her?"

It was clear this had all been Alexander’s doing. The timing was too perfect—Victoria conveniently absent, him conveniently here. But Evelyn couldn’t shake the guilt that their little game might have put someone else in an uncomfortable or even dangerous situation.

"You’ve grown quite attached to her, haven’t you?" There was an edge to his voice, something almost possessive.

"She’s my colleague and my friend. Of course I care about her." Evelyn frowned. "I should call her and tell her to come back now."

Alexander caught her wrist before she could reach for her phone. "Really? If she comes back, I’ll have to leave. Unless you’ve changed your mind about keeping us a secret?"

Evelyn hesitated, torn. The thought of sending him away so soon was unbearable. But leaving Victoria out there alone at this hour didn’t sit right with her either.

"I know, but we can’t keep her out all night," she relented, pulling her hand back. "We have all day tomorrow—just sightseeing. After that, we’ll have plenty of time together."

"So Victoria is more important than me?" His tone was teasing, but there was a flicker of something darker beneath it.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Are you jealous?"

"Isn’t it obvious?" He didn’t even try to hide it. If anything, he looked smug, as if his possessiveness was something to be proud of.

"Victoria is a woman. Why would you be jealous of a friend?" She couldn’t help but laugh.

Alexander’s grip tightened slightly, his expression unreadable. "Because when it comes to you, Evelyn, I don’t like sharing."
###Chapter 136

"Does it really matter if it's a man or a woman?" Alexander Kensington asked, his voice laced with possessiveness.

Evelyn Carter sighed. Arguing with a jealous husband was like talking to a brick wall.

"Fine," she conceded, cupping his face in her hands. "I'm flattered that Mr. Kensington is jealous over me. But," she paused, her tone softening, "we're still civilized people. We should be considerate of others. I need to check on Victoria. Behave for me, okay?"

She pressed a quick kiss to his lips before pulling away to make the call. Alexander couldn't argue—she had a point, and she’d even stroked his ego. Resisting her was impossible.

"Victoria? Are you there yet? How’s everything?" Evelyn asked, unsure if the client was real or just another one of Alexander’s schemes. Either way, she needed to make sure her friend was safe.

"Call me if you need anything," Evelyn repeated.

At the same time, Alexander’s hand slid around her waist, squeezing playfully.

Evelyn shot him a glare but kept her voice steady. "It’s nothing. Just bumped my leg against the table. I’m fine! Don’t worry about me. Get back to the hotel safely, and I’ll see you later. Bye!"

The moment she hung up, she turned on him. "Stop that!"

"What did I do?" He feigned innocence, eyes wide. "I didn’t say a word."

"No, but your hands were very busy," she retorted, mimicking his earlier action by reaching for his waist and giving it a firm pinch.

Alexander didn’t even flinch.

Evelyn blinked in disbelief. Was he made of stone?

"See?" He smirked. "I didn’t hit my leg on anything. So, the problem is yours, not mine."

She scowled. The audacity of him throwing her own words back at her!

She tried to stand, but his arms tightened around her, flipping her onto the sofa until he hovered above her. His gaze burned into hers, intense and unwavering.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Even this close, he was flawless. Life was so unfair.

"Impressed?" He grinned, tracing her jawline. "Like what you see?"

"Mm. You look delicious," she admitted, pulling him closer.

The moment she’d laid eyes on him again, the longing had only grown. All she wanted was to hold him and never let go.

Alexander buried his face in her neck, murmuring her name like a prayer.

Evelyn’s mind spun, consumed by nothing but him.
###Chapter 137

The moment was about to spiral into something far more intense when Evelyn's phone buzzed. She scrambled to grab it, her fingers fumbling as she answered.

"Hello?"

"Evelyn, I'm almost back. I'm grabbing some food. Want anything?" Victoria's voice chirped through the line.

In an instant, Evelyn snapped back to reality. She shoved against Alexander's chest, bolting upright. "N-No, thanks. I'm not hungry."

"Okay, were you already asleep? I'll be back soon," Victoria promised.

"Right, yeah!" Evelyn hung up and yanked Alexander's arm. "Hurry, Victoria's about to walk in! You have to leave—now. And don't let her see you!"

She frantically smoothed her clothes and thrust his coat at him. That was when she noticed him still lounging on the sofa, his expression stormy.

"Okay, I know this is my fault, and I'm sorry, but we can't risk exposure yet. Victoria knows who you are!" She softened her tone, trying to coax him into compliance.

Alexander exhaled sharply, irritation flashing in his eyes. "You make it sound like I'm some dirty secret."

He was pouting now, like a petulant child.

"Yes, everyone knows you—the illustrious Mr. Kensington. But could you please leave before she gets here?"

She wanted to shove him out the door, but she couldn’t risk him sulking over this. Victoria was probably in the lobby already. Why had Evelyn said she wasn’t hungry? If she’d asked for food, she could’ve bought more time.

Evelyn bit her lip, torn between urgency and not angering him further.

Alexander finally stood, draping his coat over his arm, his gaze lingering on her. She couldn’t wait any longer.

She pushed him toward the door. "Avoid her, and I’ll call you later. Wait—you’re staying in this hotel, right? Give me your room number. I’ll come to you."

Knowing Alexander, he wouldn’t have booked anywhere else. This was the safest way to meet.

His expression lightened slightly. "You better come."

"Yes, yes, I promise!"

"Don’t forget."

"I won’t!"

"You owe me for this," he murmured, tilting his head and tapping his cheek.

God, he could be such a spoiled brat.

Rolling her eyes, she stood on her toes and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek. But Alexander, ever the opportunist, turned his face at the last second.

His lips captured hers instead.

He pulled back with a smirk, ruffling her hair. "I'm leaving."

"Okay," she breathed, her fingers brushing her lips as her pulse fluttered.

She followed him to the elevator, waving as the doors slid shut.

Just as they closed, the elevator beside it dinged open.

Victoria stepped out, arms wide. "Hey, were you waiting for me?"
###Chapter 138

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat. Victoria had missed seeing them by mere seconds. Forcing a smile, Evelyn stammered, "Y-Yeah, sure!"

Victoria studied her stiff expression and narrowed her eyes. "You're acting weird."

"Who's acting weird?" Evelyn babbled, her voice unnaturally high. "You said you were almost back, so I came to wait for you. Since I’d have to open the door anyway, I figured I’d check if you were here yet. Perfect timing, right?"

She snatched the bags from Victoria’s hands and hurried toward their room. "What did you buy?"

"Those are mine!" Victoria protested, but Evelyn was already peeling open the containers.

Inside were sandwiches, noodles, and some kind of spiced flatbread. The aroma was intoxicating, though unfamiliar. Despite Victoria’s earlier claim that she hadn’t bought anything for Evelyn, the portions were clearly meant for two.

Evelyn smirked. "Thought you weren’t hungry. Regretting it now?"

Victoria swatted at her fork, but Evelyn dodged with a laugh. "Wash your hands first!"

"Don’t steal my food!" Victoria warned before disappearing into the bathroom.

Evelyn arranged the chairs and spread out the containers. "What even is this? I’ve never seen half of it."

"No clue," Victoria admitted, returning with damp hands. "The shop owner recommended it. And hey—weren’t you not hungry?"

Evelyn grinned. "Just being helpful. You bought enough for an army—can’t let it go to waste." She piled food onto Victoria’s plate.

"I don’t need help!" Victoria shot back, though her lips twitched.

They ate in comfortable silence, the table soon half-empty. Victoria groaned, rubbing her stomach. "I’m done. One more bite and I’ll explode. You clean up—I’m showering."

"Sure, go ahead," Evelyn said.

Victoria nodded but paused mid-step. "Wait… something’s off."

Evelyn blinked. "What?"

"You said you were sleeping before I got back, right?" Victoria’s eyes narrowed.

"Y-Yeah…?" Evelyn’s pulse quickened.

"Then why are you still in your event clothes? Shouldn’t you have showered or changed by now?" Victoria stepped closer, scrutinizing her.

Evelyn’s hand flew to her collar. Damn it. She was still in the outfit from earlier—all thanks to Alexander. The moment she’d stepped inside, he’d pulled her into his arms, and then… well, she hadn’t exactly had time to freshen up.

Victoria smirked. "Hmm. So… what were you doing? Meeting a secret lover, maybe?"

Evelyn scoffed, though her cheeks burned. "Oh, please. I wish I had a secret lover. I just got here—I don’t even know anyone! I was exhausted and passed out on the couch. Stop making up drama!"

Victoria laughed, but her gaze lingered just a second too long.
###Chapter 139

"Oh, is that so?" Victoria arched a brow, her tone dripping with skepticism. Evelyn's explanation hadn't swayed her in the slightest.

"Yep, that's the truth." Evelyn exhaled sharply and playfully nudged Victoria. "Honestly, I miss the old you—cold, aloof, and sparing with words. Who knew you'd turn into such a chatterbox? Go shower already. I'm next!"

"Typical deflection when someone's caught in a lie. But fine, I won't argue with a child." Victoria waved her off dismissively and headed toward the bathroom.

Evelyn rolled her eyes but secretly sighed in relief. She was grateful Victoria had let it slide—this time. Still, she knew she'd have to tread carefully the next time she saw Alexander.

Her phone buzzed, pulling her from her thoughts. A single message lit up the screen: 1808. Alexander's room number. A small smile tugged at her lips as she sent back a playful emoji before clearing the remnants of their late-night snack from the table.

As she unpacked her clothes, Victoria emerged from the bathroom, her damp hair clinging to her shoulders. "All yours," she announced, toweling off.

"Got it." Evelyn grabbed her toiletries but paused. "It's been a long day. Don't wait up for me if you're tired."

Victoria smirked. "Wait for you? Please. It's not like I need you to warm my bed."

Evelyn chuckled and disappeared into the steamy bathroom.

Meanwhile, Vanessa lay wide awake, the weight of Lucien's words pressing on her like a lead blanket. Tonight... After tonight... The clock ticked agonizingly slow. She wished morning would come faster, sparing her this torturous indecision.

But time dragged on. If she let this chance slip away, she might never get another shot at the fame she craved.

Restless, she fished her phone from under her pillow. No messages from Lucien. Of course—he didn’t need to push her. He knew her too well, knew exactly what she wanted. Like a spider waiting for its prey, he let her stew in her own temptation.

She bit her lip, then dialed Dominic. He answered instantly. "Vanessa? What's wrong?"

"I... can't sleep," she whispered, her voice barely audible.
###Chapter 140

"Why can't you sleep? Are you feeling unwell? Or is something troubling you?" Dominic's voice was laced with immediate concern.

Vanessa bit her lip, resisting the temptation to accept Lucien's offer. "I'm fine. Maybe I just miss you," she murmured softly. "Can you come see me, Dom?"

"I will, soon. Just let me wrap things up here, and I'll be on the next flight to you," Dominic replied without hesitation. But to Vanessa, it sounded like an empty excuse—another brush-off.

"What's so important that you can't leave now? The event will be over by the time you get here!" Her voice sharpened with frustration. "It's just a two-hour flight. Can't you spare a single day to be with me?"

"Vanessa, be reasonable. You know how critical this is. DR Holdings is barely recovering, and we have orders piling up. We need to push harder with our existing products while developing something new."

He shifted the topic abruptly. "Speaking of which, how's the search for a new perfumer going? Have you found anyone promising?"

Dominic's mind was consumed by the company's survival, his tone edged with urgency.

"No! All you care about is the damn company!" Vanessa snapped, her temper flaring. "I'm pregnant, Dominic! Do you honestly think I have the energy to scout for talent right now? Is that all I am to you—a recruitment agent?"

Dominic exhaled, forcing patience into his voice. "I know it's not easy, but we need someone skilled, or we won't survive in this industry!"

"You don't care about anything but your business!" Her voice cracked. "You didn't even ask how my day was. Evelyn was here today, and you didn't bother checking in. Do you have any idea how humiliated I felt during the sampling event? I nearly made a fool of myself!"

The dam broke. All the anger she'd bottled up came rushing out.

Dominic wasn't always like this. In the beginning, he was attentive—surprising her with gifts, whisking her away to exclusive events, flying across the country just to kiss her goodnight. Now, he couldn't even spare a five-minute call to ask if she was okay.

His silence stretched before he finally spoke. "W-What happened at the event? What do you mean you almost embarrassed yourself? What did Evelyn do?"

"Do you even care?" Vanessa sat up, pressing a hand to her face as tears spilled over. "Dominic, do you remember the promises you made when we first got together?"

"What promises?" Confusion colored his tone.

She let out a bitter laugh. "Of course you don't. You never took them seriously, did you? Men and their empty words. You played me for a fool."

Dominic had once vowed she'd never have to lift a finger—that she'd live as his cherished trophy wife, draped in luxury and fame. But those promises had faded like smoke.

"N-No, Vanessa, I—"

"I'm tired. I'm going to bed." Her voice turned icy, the warmth gone.

"Vanessa, I know you're upset, but please—the company isn't what it used to be. When Evelyn was with us, production ran smoothly. Now, we're barely keeping up." He hesitated. "If you could develop a new line, it would—"

"So now it's my fault?" She snatched her blanket, fury igniting in her chest. "Because I'm not as brilliant as Evelyn? Because I'm a disappointment to you, Mr. Reeves?"

"No! That's not what I meant!"

But it was too late. Vanessa hung up before he could fix it.
###Chapter 141

Vanessa ignored Dominic’s relentless calls after hanging up. The persistent ringing grated on her nerves, and she finally switched off her phone. The disturbance left her restless, sleep eluding her completely.

She moved toward the small, square window—nothing like the grand floor-to-ceiling ones in the penthouse suites she had once known. This tiny frame held her entire world now, a stark contrast to the glittering cityscape she used to gaze upon.

Vanessa could already see her future laid out before her. She was trapped in this life, and Dominic could never give her what she truly wanted.

Self-reliance was the only certainty.

She had devoted years to him, but what had it earned her? She remembered how Evelyn had once been just as devoted, only to end up discarded and forgotten. If Vanessa stayed, she’d share the same fate—aging, unwanted, invisible.

Dominic probably already has someone else lined up to replace me.

The thought sent a chill through her, despite the closed window. She wrapped her arms around herself, staring at the ceiling as she bit her lip. A decision hardened in her heart.

After a long bath, she slipped into her most alluring silk pajamas, carefully applied her makeup, and draped a coat over herself.

A glance in the mirror confirmed what she already knew.

I still have this.

Her figure was flawless, her beauty undeniable.

She ordered a bottle of the finest red wine and took the elevator up, her keycard in hand. She knew exactly where to go—Lucien Dubois’s suite. A place she had once dreamed of staying in herself.

She hesitated only for a moment.

Lucien’s power had been undeniable tonight. The way the event organizers deferred to him, the way he had effortlessly shielded her from humiliation on stage—he was a man who commanded respect.

If she couldn’t have love, she would take power.

With Lucien, she could become the most renowned perfumer in the industry. Wealth, fame, influence—all within her grasp. And once she had those, love would follow. Any man she wanted would be hers.

The door swung open before she even finished knocking.

Lucien stood there, his robe loosely tied, his dark eyes burning with unmistakable hunger.

Vanessa didn’t shy away this time.

She lifted the bottle of wine, her lips curving into a slow, knowing smile.

"I’ve made up my mind."

Lucien’s answering grin was all the confirmation she needed.
###Chapter 142

The warm water cascaded down Evelyn's body as she finished her shower. Stepping out, she noticed Victoria had already drifted into sleep, her soft snores filling the quiet bedroom. The poor woman looked utterly exhausted.

Evelyn moved silently across the plush carpet, draping a cashmere throw over Victoria's sleeping form. With one last glance at her peacefully sleeping friend, she switched off the bedside lamp and slipped out of the bedroom.

The adjoining living area of her business suite offered a cozy space with a leather sofa and minimalist furnishings. Evelyn gathered the remnants of their late-night snack, stacking the containers neatly in one corner of the glass coffee table.

Sleep eluded her tonight. The day's perfume sampling session had been unexpectedly productive. While the new fragrances showed only subtle variations, they maintained remarkable consistency with the collection's overarching theme.

But it was Lucien's creation that truly captured her attention. The sample provided by the organizers had intrigued her immediately. To an untrained nose, it might have passed for chrysanthemum, but Evelyn's expert senses detected something far more sophisticated. The French perfumer had clearly employed a refined spice that mimicked the flower's essence - a clever ruse to test the participants' expertise.

Evelyn smirked. Lucien probably thought none of the attending perfumers could discern his little trick. His arrogance was showing. Which made his sudden deference to Vanessa all the more puzzling...

Her phone vibrated against the tabletop, pulling her from her thoughts. Alexander's message blinked on the screen: "The wolves will eventually eat the naughty shepherd."

It took Evelyn a moment to decipher his meaning. Ah, "The Boy Who Cried Wolf." She'd promised to meet him earlier but got caught up in work. Now she was the dishonest shepherd in his playful analogy.

Leave it to Alexander to concoct such an elaborate way to scold her for standing him up. The mental image of him pouting while crafting this message made her lips twitch with suppressed laughter. Ridiculous man. Adorably ridiculous.

A glance at her watch showed it was well past midnight. But when had time ever stopped Alexander Kensington?

Peeking into the bedroom, she confirmed Victoria remained deeply asleep, now curled on her side murmuring something unintelligible. Satisfied, Evelyn gathered their trash and slipped out quietly.

The elevator ride to Alexander's floor seemed to take forever. The corridor lights dimmed to a romantic glow as she approached room 1808, her pulse quickening with each step.

Her knuckles barely grazed the door when it swung open. Strong hands yanked her inside, pressing her back against the wall as the door clicked shut. Alexander's familiar cologne enveloped her as his lips claimed hers in a searing kiss that left her breathless.

"When have I ever broken a promise?" she gasped when they finally parted. "I'm here now, aren't I? Instead of the girl who cried wolf, shouldn't you call me Pinocchio?" Her fingers tangled in his hair as she tried to catch her breath.

Alexander's deep chuckle vibrated against her skin. "Noted for next time," he murmured, nuzzling her neck. When she playfully swatted his chest, he caught her wrist, pressing tender kisses along her knuckles. "I missed you," he confessed, his voice rough with emotion.

The simple admission melted her defenses. "I missed you too," Evelyn whispered, her forehead resting against his. "So much."

Their lips met again, this time in a slow, worshipful kiss that spoke of longing and sweet reunion. Alexander cradled her face as if she were the most precious treasure, his touch conveying what words could never fully express.
###Chapter 143

Alexander's lips brushed against hers in a tender kiss before he pulled away abruptly. His hands lingered at her waist, fingers tightening possessively. "I want this," he murmured against her hair. "More than anything, I won't regret this choice."

Evelyn melted into his embrace, her voice barely above a whisper. "I know you won't." She could see the truth shining in his stormy gray eyes - that unshakable resolve that always took her breath away.

His arms encircled her like steel bands as he pressed a kiss to her crown. "Then why are you stopping?" Evelyn's brow furrowed in confusion. Alexander exhaled shakily, resting his forehead against hers. "Because you deserve more than a rushed moment in the dark."

The sincerity in his voice made her heart stutter. He was treating her like something precious, something to be cherished. It was more intoxicating than any perfume she'd ever created.

Evelyn buried her face against his chest, her arms winding around his neck. "I don't care about proper," she confessed. "I only care that it's you."

Alexander's breath hitched. In that moment, nothing else existed - not their pasts, not their titles, not the world outside these four walls. Just this electric connection between them.

They tumbled onto the plush bedding in a tangle of limbs. "Sleep," Alexander commanded, though his gaze burned with barely restrained desire.

Evelyn's answering smile was downright wicked. Before he could react, she surged forward, capturing his lips in a searing kiss that left them both breathless.

Alexander groaned as her teeth grazed his throat. Every nerve ending was on fire. She was everything - his muse, his match, his madness. The way she fit against him felt like destiny.

"Wealth means nothing," Evelyn whispered between kisses. "Power means nothing. As long as I'm the only one in here." Her fingertip tapped over his racing heart.

Dawn's first light found Evelyn awake, watching the sky shift from indigo to pearl. 4:17 AM glowed on the bedside clock. She exhaled in relief - still time to slip away unnoticed.

Turning, she drank in the sight of Alexander asleep beside her. Even in repose, he looked every inch the aristocrat - those sharp cheekbones, that stubborn jaw. The sheet pooled at his waist revealed a landscape of taut muscle that made her fingers itch to explore.

Last night's boldness surprised even her. No regrets, though. Not when every touch had felt like coming home.

A sudden thought chilled her - Victoria would be waking soon. Evelyn moved with practiced silence, gathering her scattered clothes.

"Running away already?" Alexander's sleep-roughened voice stopped her mid-step.

Evelyn turned to find him propped on one elbow, those keen eyes tracking her every movement. "Victoria will be up soon," she explained, fingers fumbling with her blouse buttons. "I should—"

"Stay." The single word held a world of longing. But they both knew she couldn't. Not yet.

The space between them thrummed with everything left unsaid as Evelyn slipped out the door.
###Chapter 144

"Ugh, Victoria again."

Dominic's brows furrowed in clear displeasure.

"I should have her transferred back to headquarters immediately."

Evelyn nearly choked on her own breath. Is this really how a CEO treats his employees?

"Even if you send her away, I'll still have other colleagues. You can't expect me to work alone. What if my new supervisor is a man? Then—"

Before she could finish, Dominic yanked her toward him, pinning her against the bed.

His gaze darkened as he feigned anger. "You wouldn't dare."

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh.

"Of course I wouldn't. Compared to that, Victoria suddenly seems like the better option, doesn't she?"

"Hmph." He scoffed but shifted slightly, easing his weight off her.

Fingers threading through her hair, he murmured, "Let's make this public."

Her smile faltered. She shook her head.

"Just a little longer."

Dominic exhaled sharply but didn't argue.

He respected her choice, even if it frustrated him.

At first, their secret marriage hadn't bothered him.

What did it matter? They were already bound together—public or private made no difference to him.

But hiding their relationship? That grated on him. It wasn't exhilarating. It was suffocating.

"I'm literally downstairs. You can see me whenever you want."

Evelyn cupped his cheek, her voice softening. "Besides, I won't be here forever. We have our whole lives ahead of us."

A slow, knowing smirk curled his lips.

"You're right. We do have forever."

Something in his tone made her pause.

Then it clicked.

Her cheeks burned.

"You're disgusting!"

She shoved him aside and scrambled off the bed.

The next morning, golden sunlight spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Vanessa stirred, blinking against the brightness.

The breathtaking view outside momentarily distracted her from the dull ache in her limbs—proof of last night's intensity.

He promised to take me to Laurentia. To introduce me to the finest perfumers. To make me one of the best.

A hand suddenly clamped around her wrist, yanking her back down.

"Ah—!"

Before she could react, Lucien loomed over her, his blue eyes piercing.

Fear prickled down her spine.

"L-Lucien, I'm—I'm tired. Can I shower first?"

His grip tightened.

"You don't get to refuse."
###Chapter 145

Evelyn crept back to her room on silent feet. Swiping her access card, she slipped through the door, forcing her expression into practiced calm.

"Well, look who decided to come back." The sardonic voice behind her made Evelyn freeze mid-step as she was closing the door.

"V-Victoria! You're awake?" Evelyn turned to find Victoria Sterling perched on the sofa in silk pajamas, arms crossed. The way her manager tapped her foot suggested she'd been waiting for hours. "Did I wake you? I just went to take out the trash and grab breakfast. Sorry for disturbing you." The rehearsed lie rolled off Evelyn's tongue effortlessly.

"Bravo! Do continue this fascinating performance." Victoria's dry chuckle held no amusement.

"What performance?" Evelyn blinked with exaggerated innocence before yawning dramatically. "I'm exhausted from waking up so early. Think I'll catch some more sleep."

She made to stride toward her bedroom, but Victoria moved like lightning. One bare foot shot out to block Evelyn's path. "You really think I'll let you slither away that easily?"

Evelyn offered a sheepish smile. "Slither? Now you're being dramatic. I just need rest."

"Not happening. Spill it - where were you gallivanting all night?" Victoria's tone turned prosecutorial, as if addressing a felon in the interrogation room.

Evelyn bit back a laugh at the phrasing. "Gallivanting? With whom exactly? You were snoring when I finished showering last night, and I went straight to bed. Just woke up earlier than you today. Your accusations are getting wild."

She attempted to sidestep Victoria, but her manager blocked her again. "I've been awake since 1 AM, Carter. Your bed was empty. If you supposedly slept, when exactly did you rise? Before 1 AM to take out trash that mysteriously took six hours?"

Evelyn's mouth went dry. She hadn't anticipated Victoria keeping vigil all night. 'She never mentioned waking up. Was she really waiting here the entire time?'

"You didn't... stay up all night, did you?" Evelyn leaned closer, noticing the purple shadows beneath Victoria's eyes. Guilt twisted in her stomach.

"Don't deflect! I waited up all night while your phone went straight to voicemail. I nearly filed a missing person report twenty minutes ago! You're not leaving this room until I get the truth." Victoria planted herself before the exit like an avenging angel.

"Fine." Evelyn collapsed onto the sofa with a sigh. After a theatrical pause, she offered, "I woke at 1 AM, took out the trash because I couldn't sleep, then went for a midnight jog. Got lost. Wandered for hours. Satisfied?" She peered up through her lashes, knowing the flimsy tale wouldn't survive scrutiny.

Victoria's glare could have melted steel. With another sigh, Evelyn surrendered. "Alright, I met a friend."

"A friend?" Victoria pounced. "What friend? This is your first time in Silverpine Valley. Friend from where? Male? Female? And why meet at such ungodly hours?"

Evelyn couldn't help laughing at the rapid-fire interrogation. "Vic, are you auditioning for detective roles? I'm sorry for worrying you, but some things are private, no?"

"This isn't about privacy." Victoria's voice softened unexpectedly. "You're my responsibility on this trip. We're in unfamiliar territory. If something happened to you, how would I face your family? The company? I need to know you're safe." The genuine concern in her eyes made Evelyn's defenses crumble.
###Chapter 146

Victoria's questions came from a place of genuine concern, so Evelyn didn't mind letting her finish. Still, she couldn't bring herself to reveal the truth about her relationship with Alexander just yet. That was a secret she had to keep—for now. She silently promised herself she'd make it up to Victoria someday.

"Don't worry," Evelyn said, carefully choosing her words. "My friend isn’t from here. He’s just visiting for business, so we arranged to meet up." She hesitated before adding, "We had to schedule it late because of his availability. Both of us were swamped with work during the day."

The excuse sounded flimsy even to her own ears, but it was still better than admitting she'd gotten lost on her nighttime jog. Victoria nodded slowly, but then her eyes widened in realization. "Wait—your friend is a man?"

Evelyn didn’t answer, but her expression gave her away.

Victoria gasped. "Is he your boyfriend?"

Evelyn bit her lip. "I guess?" Technically, he’s my husband, but ‘boyfriend’ isn’t entirely wrong. It’s just… a few steps behind.

"Oh!" Victoria exhaled dramatically, as if a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh at her reaction. "Why do you look relieved that I have a boyfriend?"

Victoria grinned like a proud mother whose daughter had finally brought someone home. "Because if you’re seeing someone, then you probably wouldn’t—" She cut herself off abruptly.

The hesitation in her voice reminded Evelyn of yesterday’s unfinished conversation. Victoria had done the same thing then—started a sentence and trailed off as if the topic was too delicate. At the time, Evelyn hadn’t pressed her, but now, curiosity got the better of her. "Wouldn’t what?"

"Forget it," Victoria said quickly, waving a hand. "It’s just baseless gossip." She looked embarrassed, as if she regretted ever entertaining the rumors.

But Evelyn could guess exactly what she’d been about to say. "You mean people think I only got into Phoenix Labs because I have connections with someone in management, right?"

Victoria’s eyes widened. "N-No! I didn’t say that!"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "I know you didn’t. But that’s what everyone else is whispering, isn’t it?"

Victoria sighed. "Not everyone." Since the topic was out in the open, she stopped dodging it. "Mr. Preston told me we had to keep you at Phoenix Labs, but the rest of the team doesn’t know why. I’ve seen your talent firsthand now, but… I’ll be honest. At first, I assumed you got in through connections."

Evelyn listened quietly, her expression unreadable. She understood why people would think that. It was exactly why she didn’t want her relationship with Alexander public. She needed to prove herself—not as Alexander Kensington’s wife, but as Evelyn Carter, a perfumer who earned her place through skill alone.

Victoria continued, "But I don’t think your connections are with anyone at Phoenix Labs. Mr. Preston is the highest authority here, and there’s clearly nothing between you two. My guess? You know someone at Celestia Group. That’s the only reason he’d protect you like this."

Evelyn’s breath caught. She hadn’t expected Victoria to piece it together so accurately.
###Chapter 147

Evelyn smiled nonchalantly. "So, who is it from Celestia Group then?"

Victoria sighed. "What do you mean by who? It's all just a misunderstanding. I'm not sure why Mr. Preston insists on keeping you here, but I know it's not merely because of your connections or luck. You have the potential to be a great perfumer."

This was the greatest affirmation for Evelyn. "Thanks. I'm glad you think so."

"Hey, stop flattering me! Didn't you say you wanted to sleep? Go ahead, but don't sleep for too long." Victoria glanced at her watch. "We need to arrive at the site earlier."

"The site?" Evelyn repeated, then quickly understood. Silverpine Valley had the perfect climate for flowers and plants to thrive. There were countless parterres, including experimental plots for grafting new breeds. After all, perfumers often drew inspiration from nature. Each plant was a treasure, unique in its own way. Through refinement, purification, and blending with other fragrances, a perfumer could craft something extraordinary.

"I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's go now." Evelyn checked the time. "I'll shower and change. We can leave right after."

"Aren't you tired?" Victoria asked, watching Evelyn head to the bathroom.

"It's fine. I managed to rest a little earlier." The moment the words left her mouth, Evelyn realized her phrasing was off. Sure enough, Victoria gave her a knowing look when she turned back.

Whatever. The more I explain, the more suspicious she’ll get. Better to say nothing.

Soon, Evelyn emerged from the shower. Victoria had already packed up and was waiting. "Let’s head downstairs for breakfast. The hotel serves a buffet, and it should be ready by now."

Just as they were about to leave, the doorbell rang.

"Who is it?" Victoria called out, staying by the door without opening it.

"Room service. My apologies for the disturbance, ma'am. I’ve brought breakfast for you." A polite voice filtered through the door.

Victoria glanced back at Evelyn in confusion before opening it. A waiter stood there with a dining cart. "Good morning. Breakfast is served."

"The hotel has a buffet, doesn’t it? Does this cost extra?" Victoria asked, mentally calculating their expense report for the trip.

"Your room rate includes this service. The buffet is available in the restaurant if you prefer." The waiter arranged the dishes on the table, then set out the cutlery. "Enjoy your meal."

The spread on the table left Victoria speechless. Why would I go downstairs when this is here? The selection was lavish—far beyond the standard buffet. There was enough food for four people.

"This hotel’s service is incredible! I’ll definitely book here again." Victoria sat down, motioning for Evelyn to join her. "Stop standing there. Sit and eat!"

She beamed, clearly pleased with the trip. "Let me tell you—I’ve been on countless business trips, and I’ve never been treated like this. The company really supports us, so we better make this trip worthwhile. If we can find even a little inspiration, it’ll be a success."

Evelyn knew someone must have arranged this. Again.
###Chapter 148

He showed his care for her in every possible way.

After breakfast, they set off for the site. Though it was only 7 a.m. and a crisp morning breeze swept through the air, the stark contrast between day and night temperatures was undeniable. Evelyn had draped a lightweight cardigan over her shoulders and shielded herself with a wide-brimmed sun hat.

Sun protection was essential—they would be spending the entire day at the nursery.

This time, instead of a Rolls-Royce, they were escorted in a rugged Summit Trailhawk. Victoria didn’t comment, but her eyes sparkled with barely contained excitement. The SUV was a beast—perfect for off-road terrain and exactly what they needed for this trip.

"What an incredible perk from the company. I had no idea we had access to such a diverse fleet." Victoria marveled, her gaze fixed on the passing scenery outside the window.

Then she turned to Evelyn, who had rested her head against the glass. Evelyn could feel Victoria’s scrutinizing stare but kept her eyes trained on the landscape, feigning ignorance.

Victoria, however, wasn’t one to let things go. She leaned in abruptly, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Your boyfriend isn’t secretly part of Celestia Group’s upper management, is he?"

Evelyn whipped her head around, blinking in exaggerated disbelief. "If he were, do you think I’d be slaving away at Phoenix Labs? I’d be lounging at headquarters."

Victoria considered this and conceded with a thoughtful hum. "Fair point. Still, this level of luxury is going to ruin me for future work trips."

Evelyn pretended not to hear, focusing instead on the approaching nursery.

As they neared the entrance, vibrant flower beds stretched endlessly before them, a riot of colors that instantly lifted their moods. The fields were so vast that the horizon blurred into a sea of blossoms.

The moment the car stopped and the doors opened, the intoxicating fragrance of flowers enveloped them. "Achoo! Achoo!" Evelyn sneezed violently, hastily pulling on her facemask for relief.

Her sense of smell was unusually sharp—a gift that sometimes felt like a curse. Overwhelming scents could easily overpower her, especially when multiple fragrances mingled in the air.

Victoria, though less sensitive, still wrinkled her nose at the intensity.

A representative from the nursery was already waiting to greet them, having been briefed on their visit. After a quick introduction to the facility, he led them inside.

"All our roses are cultivated here. Though they belong to the same family, the varieties are endless. Over there, you’ll find our sunflowers, and beyond that, the camellias."

Pride laced his voice as he gestured around. "You won’t find a nursery in all of Veridia with a collection as diverse as ours. Whatever flower you seek, we have it."

"Mind if we explore on our own?" Victoria asked, already nodding in anticipation.

The man hesitated briefly before relenting. "Of course. Just be careful—this place is massive. It’s easy to get lost, and walking back can be exhausting."

Victoria flashed him a confident grin. "Don’t worry about us!"
###Chapter 149

The nursery supervisor hadn’t exaggerated—the place was massive.

After wandering around all morning, Evelyn and Victoria had barely covered a third of the grounds, their legs already aching.

“Let’s wrap this up soon,” Victoria said, brushing her hands together, her forehead glistening with sweat. “We’ll have them send us samples of everything. Once we compare them, we’ll finalize our choices. That’ll be it.”

The temperature had climbed sharply since morning. Even after shedding their cardigans, the heat was stifling.

Evelyn shook her head. “I want to explore a little longer.”

Victoria blinked. “What for? We’ve seen enough. This place is enormous—we could spend days here and still miss things.” She sighed. “Tell me what you’re looking for. I’ll arrange for someone to drive us directly.”

Walking any further would be exhausting.

“It’s fine,” Evelyn insisted. “I just want to see if I can find something unexpected.”

Victoria frowned. “The office already has samples of every flower here. It’s not like you’ll discover anything new.”

But Evelyn wasn’t budging.

With a reluctant sigh, Victoria relented. “Alright, fine. I’ll come with you.”

She wasn’t wrong—most perfumers worked from samples. They’d review the options, make their selections, and the nursery would handle the rest. Few would ever trek through the fields themselves.

“Thanks, Vic.” Evelyn felt a twinge of guilt but pressed on.

Because what she sought wasn’t just flowers.

Nature was abundant—flowers, grasses, trees, even certain nts. Any of them could hold the key to a new fragrance, overlooked unless someone searched in person.

Lately, Evelyn had been chasing an idea—one she couldn’t quite articulate. Maybe here, she’d find the missing piece.

Perfumers drew from their emotions, but translating those feelings into scent wasn’t easy. She had to see for herself.

The bed was empty.

For a moment, it felt like waking from a dream.

Gritting her teeth, Evelyn inhaled deeply before shifting to the edge of the mattress. She eased her legs down, toes curling into the plush slippers—

Just as the bathroom door clicked open.

Lucien stepped out, a towel slung low around his hips, water droplets clinging to his skin.

Evelyn gasped.

Her pulse spiked, her gaze darting anywhere but at him.

When he strode toward her, instinct screamed at her to flee—but where could she go?

In seconds, he was there, caging her between his arms as he leaned down.

His fingers tilted her chin up.

“Morning, darling.”
###Chapter 150

"You're awake?" Lucien forced a smirk. "You're about to get exactly what you deserve." His words erased every trace of her humiliation as she stared at him with wide, hopeful eyes. "Really?"

"Of course." He leaned down, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "Shower and get dressed. I'm taking you somewhere special."

"Where?" The moment he spoke, a surge of energy rushed through her.

"You wanted to learn how to become a star perfumer, didn’t you? Then stop asking questions and just do as I say."

Finally, he straightened, withdrawing his arms. When his gaze dropped to Vanessa, the weight of it pressed down on her, leaving her speechless.

He wasn’t wrong—but it made her feel like nothing more than a commodity, something he could price at his whim. The thought unsettled her, but then again, wasn’t this the deal? She’d give him what he wanted in exchange for her dreams. That was how bargains worked.

If she suddenly grew a conscience over pride, he’d probably laugh. To him, she was just a transaction. Once she accepted that, the discomfort faded.

Lucien seemed pleased, a quiet chuckle escaping him. When Vanessa returned to her cramped room this time, everything felt different. Soon, she’d leave this dingy life behind and step into the luxury she’d always craved.

She picked out a sheer, figure-hugging dress and paired it with silver stilettos—sexy, but elegant. Standing before the mirror, she examined herself. Though the events of last night had left her slightly pale, her curves still looked flawless.

After finishing her makeup, she finally remembered her phone. It had died last night, so she’d left it charging in the kitchen. She hadn’t thought she’d need it, but the moment she turned it on, a flood of messages from Dominic lit up the screen.

"Vanessa, answer me. We need to talk."

"Vanessa, are you still upset? I can explain."

"Vanessa, turn your phone on. I’m worried."

"Vanessa, it’s my fault. Forgive me."

"Vanessa, I’ll give you anything. Just don’t be angry."

"You know you’re the only one I love."

Vanessa felt nothing. If she’d seen these before last night, she might have wavered. But now? There was no going back.

I’m not stupid enough to wait around for him. He can keep his empty promises.
###Chapter 151

Vanessa deleted all the messages with a satisfied smile before heading downstairs. At the hotel entrance, her eyes lit up at the sight of a sleek Summit Trailhawk parked outside. Her heart raced when she spotted Lucien Dubois waiting behind the wheel. The fact that a man of his status would personally pick her up made her feel important.

"Where did this car come from? I don’t recall DR Holdings arranging this," she asked, trying to suppress her excitement.

"That tiny company of yours?" Lucien’s tone dripped with disdain. Vanessa didn’t take offense—she knew DR Holdings was insignificant compared to his empire. Still, it stung a little. She had once dreamed of expanding it into a powerhouse, but those ambitions had faded.

Someone like Lucien would naturally look down on such a small venture.

"Mm," she nodded.

"Honestly," Lucien said, his fingers tapping the steering wheel, "if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have bothered riding in your company’s car from the airport."

Vanessa didn’t know how much truth there was in his words, but they still sent a thrill through her.

"Where are we going?" she asked, anticipation coloring her voice.

"You’ll see."

The car sped through the streets, and soon, they arrived at their destination.

Vanessa gasped, her heart fluttering. "Oh my god, it’s breathtaking! I never knew a place like this existed! Lucien, how did you even find this? You’re incredible!"

Lucien smirked as he parked the car. He leaned slightly toward her, his voice low. "I am incredible. In more ways than one."

"Ugh, stop it!" She playfully shoved his shoulder, laughing as her cheeks flushed.

Meanwhile, the sun blazed mercilessly overhead. Evelyn wiped the sweat from her brow, her skin flushed from the heat. Beside her, Victoria Sterling looked equally exhausted, her breathing labored.

"Victoria, let’s head back inside for now. We can continue later," Evelyn suggested.

Victoria nodded, pausing to catch her breath. "Alright."

They had wandered far enough that Victoria called for a car from the base to pick them up. While they waited, she fanned herself with her hat, watching as Evelyn moved gracefully among the flowers.

Even under the scorching sun, Evelyn’s skin remained flawless, glowing rather than tanning. The vibrant blooms around her paled in comparison to her beauty. The way the sunlight caught the strands of her slightly disheveled hair, the beads of sweat trailing down her neck—it all made her look ethereal.

Victoria had initially been skeptical of Evelyn, assuming she’d gotten into Phoenix Labs through connections rather than skill. But Evelyn had proven herself time and again, acing even the most complex assessments.

"Evelyn," Victoria finally asked, curiosity getting the better of her, "what exactly are you searching for out here?"

She had accompanied many colleagues on field trips, but none had been as relentless as Evelyn.

Evelyn paused, considering the question. "A raw material with the exact extract I need."

Victoria frowned. "What kind of extract?"
###Chapter 152

"I'm not sure."

Evelyn's vague response made Victoria sigh. She tried a different approach. "Alright, then. What kind of scent are you looking for?"

"I can't put it into words." Evelyn's answers were frustratingly elusive, but Victoria had learned to decipher them over time.

Still, this was one thing Victoria couldn't assist with.

The car from the research facility arrived shortly after, though it wasn’t the same young man who had dropped them off earlier. This driver was far more animated. "Tired? You two went farther out than most. Visitors usually don’t stay more than an hour."

He continued cheerfully, "We have the freshest samples here—picked and shipped the same day. We even rotate them daily, so you don’t have to worry about wilting affecting your judgment. Just tell us what you need, and we’ll handle the rest."

As he drove, Evelyn gazed silently at the rows of flowers lining the nursery. The air was thick with overlapping fragrances—each distinct, yet none quite right. She inhaled deeply, eyes closed, sorting through the scents effortlessly.

"You’ve got a massive operation here. Must be hard to maintain?" Victoria asked.

The driver chuckled. "It’s challenging, sure, but it’s our passion. Seeing these blooms thrive under our care? Worth every effort." He glanced at them in the rearview mirror. "We’re always short-staffed, though. My brother’s handling another pickup, so I had to step in. Once I drop you off, I’ve got deworming solutions to prep."

Evelyn murmured an apology, but he waved it off. "No trouble at all. You’re our guests."

His easygoing nature kept the conversation flowing. "How many visitors do you get daily?"

"Plenty during peak season, but it’s been slow lately. Though with that perfume sampling event these past few days, we’ve seen more traffic. You two were the first today, but expect a crowd this afternoon."

They arrived at the facility, and the driver gestured toward the main hall. "Go on in and rest up. I’ve got to head to the shed."

"Thanks, we’ll manage," Evelyn said.

Victoria nudged her as they walked. "We should move fast. Once the others arrive, the best materials will be picked over."

Evelyn wasn’t worried. Perfume-making wasn’t about grabbing the most popular ingredients—it was about finding the perfect ones.

"I’m parched," Victoria muttered. "Hope they have iced water inside."

Evelyn reached for the door just as it swung open from within.

"Evelyn?!"

Vanessa’s sharp voice cut through the air. Her eyes widened in disbelief. Of all people, she hadn’t expected to run into her again. What kind of twisted joke is this?

Victoria’s expression darkened. She recognized this woman from the past two days—the same bold, entitled attitude.

Vanessa, of course, barely registered Victoria’s presence. Her focus was entirely on Evelyn. She raked her gaze over Evelyn’s flushed, sweat-dampened face and sneered.

"What the hell are you doing here?"
###Chapter 153

"You..." Vanessa Blake was stunned and opened her mouth to lash out. Lucien Dubois beside her raised a hand to stop her.

"Vanessa, this must be Evelyn Carter—the one you've mentioned before."

Vanessa blinked, then nodded. "Yes, it's her."

"Ms. Carter," Lucien began, his tone measured, "removing a single ingredient from an essential oil formula while keeping the rest intact may seem insignificant, but the results are entirely different." He paused, lips curving into a faint smirk. "You're quite clever."

Evelyn arched a brow, studying him before realization struck. "You're the one Dominic brought in to fix the formula?"

No wonder Dominic had suddenly stopped panicking. According to the latest reports from Veridian City, DR Holdings' factory had resumed operations. That could only mean the formula issue had been resolved.

Of course, Evelyn knew DR Holdings couldn't have solved it with their existing team. Dominic must have outsourced help. Still, she had been preoccupied in Silverpine Valley and hadn't given much thought to who he might have hired. She hadn't expected to meet the man face-to-face here.

Evelyn didn't recognize Lucien, but given the VIP treatment he'd received from the organizers last night and his sharp deduction about the formula, he was clearly someone of significance. The real question was—why would someone like him help Dominic?

Ignoring the sarcasm in his tone, Evelyn simply smiled. "Thank you for the compliment."

She had no intention of engaging in a pointless argument, but Vanessa wasn't one to let things go. Especially not after seeing Evelyn in the first-class cabin during their flight from Veridian City. Vanessa had suffered nothing but setbacks because of Evelyn—she wasn’t about to miss this chance to humiliate her now that she had the upper hand.

"Are you stupid?" Vanessa scoffed, rolling up her sleeves with exaggerated disdain. "Who do you think you are, fishing for compliments from Mr. Dubois? Compared to him, you're a child playing with toys. Your little tricks are pathetic. Stop embarrassing yourself."

She smirked, eyes gleaming with malice. "Evelyn, you must think you're untouchable now that you're with Phoenix Labs. But Phoenix isn't Celestia Group! And even Celestia wouldn’t waste time protecting someone like you. Know your place and stop deluding yourself."

Victoria Sterling, who had been watching silently, finally stepped forward. Her expression darkened as she positioned herself between Evelyn and Vanessa.

"Regardless of where Evelyn stands, she’s earned everything herself," Victoria snapped. "Unlike some people who steal others' work and still have the audacity to act superior. Shame must be a foreign concept to you."

Vanessa's face twisted, flushing red with fury. She glared at Victoria. "Who the hell are you? This is between me and Evelyn. Stay out of it!"

"Evelyn is my colleague and friend," Victoria retorted, lifting her chin. "Her business is my business."

The declaration warmed Evelyn’s chest.

Vanessa let out a mocking laugh. "Oh, another Phoenix lackey. No wonder you’re so arrogant. Let me give you some advice—Evelyn is a two-faced snake. You’ll regret defending her when she stabs you in the back."

Victoria didn’t flinch. "Save your breath. I have eyes—I can see exactly who the real snake is."
###Chapter 154

Vanessa hadn’t anticipated Victoria’s sharp retort. To make matters worse, Evelyn remained composed, offering no reaction, which only fueled Vanessa’s frustration.

Her temper flared. "You think Phoenix Labs is so impressive?" she sneered. "It’s nothing more than a minor branch of Celestia Group—hardly superior to DR Holdings. And let’s not forget, no one in Celestia, let alone your little company, can hold a candle to Mr. Dubois."

Vanessa clung to Lucien’s arm, her voice dripping with arrogance.

Lucien, though silent during their exchange, radiated disdain. "Vanessa, we’re wasting time. Let’s focus on why we’re here."

"You’re right," she huffed, waving a hand in front of her nose as if repelled by an invisible stench. "This place reeks. Let’s go."

Victoria gaped as Vanessa strutted away. "What a piece of work," she muttered to Evelyn. "She starts the fight, then acts like she’s too good for this place. How were you ever friends with her?"

Evelyn sighed. She had been fooled by Vanessa’s act once, blind to her true nature. "Let’s not dwell on her. It’s pointless," she said, steering Victoria toward the entrance. "Aren’t you thirsty?"

"Oh, right!" Victoria groaned. "She got me so worked up I forgot!"

Meanwhile, Vanessa and Lucien made their way to the nursery, but her mind was elsewhere. If Evelyn and that insufferable Victoria were here, did that mean Phoenix Labs was also sourcing materials?

A wicked thought crossed her mind—she could return, discover what they needed, and buy it all before they had the chance.

The idea gnawed at her. Why did Evelyn always land on her feet? Even after being forced out of DR Holdings, she had Phoenix Labs, and she seemed… happy.

The lawsuit, the online smear campaign—none of it had broken her.

Why?

Vanessa clenched her fists. She would outshine Evelyn. She would be more beautiful, more dazzling—she would make sure of it.

"Vanessa, what’s on your mind?" Lucien’s voice snapped her back to reality.

She forced a smile. "I was just thinking… they must be here for supplies. I wonder if they’re after the same thing we are."
###Chapter 155

Evelyn was severely dehydrated, and it took several bottles of water to revive her energy. "The reputation of this place is well-earned," she remarked, her voice still slightly hoarse. "The variety of flowers is impressive, and the fragrance is remarkably pure."

She pulled out a notepad and scribbled down her requirements. "I'll list the types and quantities I need. How about a twenty percent discount from your initial offer?" Evelyn expertly negotiated, flashing a charming smile as she gestured for a better deal.

The seller hesitated, wiping his brow. "T-That's a bit too low. The best I can do is ten percent. You won't find a better price anywhere else."

"Honestly, I know this isn't the lowest market price," Evelyn countered smoothly. "But I genuinely admire the quality of your products. We're both looking for a long-term partnership, aren't we? A little extra margin for us would go a long way."

She paused, letting the words sink in before adding, "We didn’t come here specifically to scout suppliers, you know. I could easily forward this list to DR Holdings, and our procurement team would take over. Trust me, their terms won’t be as generous as mine."

It was common knowledge that corporate procurement followed strict protocols, with seasoned negotiators who drove hard bargains. The seller shifted uncomfortably before finally relenting. "A-Alright, fine. Is this everything you need? Anything else?"

Evelyn was about to decline when she glanced back at Victoria, who had been silently observing.

"We’d like to browse a little more," Evelyn said. "Do you have any specialty flowers or plants with unique scents?"

"We do, but they might not be considered 'unique' to experts like you."

Large nurseries like this often stocked rare botanicals that fascinated enthusiasts, but what was exotic to the average person might be mundane to professionals like them.

"It doesn’t matter. I’d still love to see them," Victoria chimed in.

With the seller leading the way, Evelyn and Victoria stepped into the greenhouse. Despite the bright sunlight outside, the air inside was pleasantly cool, thanks to the efficient circulation system.

"Elliot! Elliot!" the seller called out.

Moments later, the same man who had greeted them earlier in the flower fields appeared. His white sweatshirt was damp with sweat, evidence of his labor.

When he spotted them, his face lit up. "Oh, it’s you again!"

"These guests want to see some rare plants. Could you show them around?"

"Of course!" Elliot agreed cheerfully, rinsing his hands at a nearby tap. "Right this way."

The greenhouse flowers were far more delicate than those outside, requiring precise conditions of sunlight and moisture. Their prices reflected their exclusivity.

"Is this all you have?" Victoria asked after a thorough inspection, unable to find anything that caught her eye. Evelyn, however, had already noted several varieties she wanted—though further price discussions were inevitable.

"Most of them are here," Elliot admitted, scratching his head. Then, as if remembering something, he added, "We do have a special variant of Crimson Mahogany. Would you like to see it?"

"You grow that here too? It’s expensive, but not exactly rare," Evelyn remarked skeptically.

"Ours is different," Elliot explained carefully. "It’s a unique cultivar we developed ourselves. I doubt you’ll find it anywhere else."

He was careful not to make absolute claims, but the pride in his voice was unmistakable.
###Chapter 156

"Let's take a closer look." Evelyn's curiosity was piqued.

As they stepped inside, their eyes fell upon several containers of crimson mahogany. At first glance, they appeared nearly identical to the standard variety. The market was flooded with imitations, but these specimens seemed remarkably authentic—at least upon initial inspection.

Yet, they weren't particularly rare.

"What makes these so special?" Vanessa leaned in, studying the leaves before inhaling their scent deeply.

"You're the experts. Why don’t you examine them yourselves?" Elliot, who carried himself with an air of quiet confidence, offered a knowing smile.

Evelyn moved closer, her fingers brushing against the foliage before plucking a leaf. A drop of sap beaded at the broken stem, releasing an unexpected fragrance—one that carried both warmth and a crisp, cooling edge.

Her fingertips traced the branch, pausing where the wood bore a faint, deliberate scar.

"You grafted this?"

The gardener's eyes lit up with approval. "Sharp eye, miss. You're the first to notice." He gave an impressed nod. "Grafting? What did you fuse it with?" Vanessa’s interest sharpened as she crushed a leaf between her fingers, breathing in its essence.

Elliot chuckled, but there was unmistakable pride in his expression. "Trade secret."

For a gardener, success in cultivation was akin to raising a prodigy—a labor of love worth guarding.

"Mint, isn't it?" Evelyn said.

Elliot’s jaw slackened. "How did you—?"

This experiment had been his private endeavor, untested and unshared. Yet, she had discerned it in moments.

The realization that his secret was laid bare so effortlessly left him equal parts stunned and amused.

"The scent gives it away," Evelyn explained. "Crimson mahogany has its own richness, but this carries something sharper—a cool, almost medicinal freshness. It shouldn’t work, yet it does."

Vanessa dropped to one knee, pressing her nose to the leaves. "She’s right. It is mint."

Earlier, she had detected something unusual but couldn’t place it. The idea of grafting hadn’t even crossed her mind—let alone that it could succeed so seamlessly.

Her gaze flicked to Evelyn, admiration flickering in her eyes.

"You’ve got an incredible nose, miss. We’ve been experimenting for months, and mint is the only pairing that’s taken. What do you think of the blend? Too strange, or…?"

These plants were still in trial. Market viability was uncertain, and mass production hadn’t begun.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "They’re perfect. I’ll take them." Her finger pointed decisively at the crimson mahogany.
###Chapter 157

"I'm afraid I can't sell them to you." Elliot Dawson hesitated, rubbing his temple. "As you know, Crimson Mahogany isn't easy to cultivate. We've invested years of research and labor into these specimens. Besides, our stock is limited—they're not meant for bulk purchase."

Evelyn Carter didn’t back down.

This was from N?velDrama.Org.

"I don’t need bulk. Just half of what you have here." Her voice was firm. "I’d take the rest, but I’ll leave them for now—provided you continue nurturing them. And you won’t sell to anyone else."

Elliot shifted uncomfortably. "I’m sorry, but we can’t agree to those terms."

"Name your price," Victoria Sterling interjected, sensing Evelyn’s determination. She recognized the rarity of grafted Crimson Mahogany—if they secured it, it could be invaluable. But the cost would undoubtedly be steep.

"It’s not just about money," Elliot explained, frustration creeping into his tone. "These are still experimental. We’re refining the cultivation process—"

"You can continue your research with the remaining half. I won’t interfere. I only want half, and I’ll pay upfront."

Elliot exhaled sharply. "I’ll need to consult my team." The offer was tempting, but this wasn’t his call to make alone.

Victoria pulled Evelyn aside as Elliot stepped away to make a call. "Evelyn, think this through. Do we really need this much? We haven’t even tested these in a finished product yet. Even if we create an extraordinary perfume, the material cost alone would drive the price sky-high. How many customers would pay for that?"

Her concerns were valid. Perfumery was a business, after all—luxury or not, profitability mattered.

"There will always be those who recognize true craftsmanship," Evelyn countered, unwavering.

"But Phoenix Labs is still new. Most don’t see us as a luxury brand yet."

"That’s exactly why we need to make a statement." Evelyn met her gaze. "If this fails, deduct the cost from my salary."

Victoria’s eyes widened. "You’re being reckless."

Before she could argue further, Elliot returned, clearing his throat. "If you’re set on purchasing, we can proceed. But the price—"

"We’ll negotiate."

Elliot chuckled at Evelyn’s resolve. "Your sincerity is noted. We won’t inflate the price unfairly, but cultivation costs are high. Even with minimal markup, the final number won’t be small." He scribbled a figure on a notepad and slid it toward them.

Victoria paled. "That’s—"

A six-digit sum glared back at them.
###Chapter 158

"Absolutely." Evelyn made her choice.

"Evelyn, perhaps we should think this through again." As Evelyn's superior, Victoria felt compelled to caution her. Yet, seeing Evelyn's unwavering confidence—so much so that she was willing to stake her own reputation—Victoria couldn't outright refuse.

"If you believe this isn't the right move, I can purchase it under my name with my own funds." Though Evelyn didn't have much on hand, she knew exactly who to borrow from.

"Very well." Victoria sighed, conceding. She turned to Elliot, her tone firm. "Make sure you provide only the highest quality. No substitutes or inferior products—understood?"

"Rest assured, even if we wanted to, we couldn't. There simply aren't any low-grade alternatives for this." The item was too rare. Producing subpar versions would require breeding entirely new specimens first.

"That's what I like to hear."

After signing the contract and paying the deposit, the two women left the nursery.

At the entrance, a car nearly identical to theirs—save for the color—was parked nearby. As Evelyn and Victoria climbed into their Summit Trailhawk, they spotted Vanessa stepping out of the other vehicle, her arm looped possessively through Lucien's.

"Evelyn, get in and shut the door. The witch is here," Victoria muttered, already seated. Evelyn stifled a laugh—she hadn’t realized Victoria had such a sharp sense of humor.

Of course, Vanessa noticed them. The moment she saw Evelyn sliding into the luxury SUV, her glare turned venomous, as if she could pierce through steel. But their driver pulled away swiftly, leaving the parking lot before any confrontation could erupt.

Victoria glanced back, amused. Vanessa was still staring after them, her expression twisted with bitterness.

"Evelyn," Victoria mused, "did you steal her boyfriend, or did she steal yours? The way she looks at you, one would think you ruined her life."

"I’m neither that bored nor that cruel," Evelyn replied dryly.

Victoria chuckled. "Fair enough. But that hatred isn’t normal. Every time she sees you, it’s like you’re her worst enemy. What’s her problem?"

It was hard to decipher Vanessa’s exact grudge. Evelyn shook her head, equally puzzled. Truthfully, she might never have noticed Vanessa’s hostility if she hadn’t uncovered Dominic’s affair with her.

Though they were never close, many assumed Evelyn and Vanessa were friends—simply because Evelyn kept to herself, with only Vanessa and Dominic by her side during university.

Dominic had justified Vanessa’s constant presence by claiming DR Holdings needed her expertise in public relations and research. He even brought her to corporate events, insisting it was for the company’s growth. Evelyn hadn’t objected. She’d never wronged Vanessa—so where did this resentment come from?
###Chapter 159

Vanessa only looked away when Evelyn's car vanished down the road. She turned to grip Lucien's arm tightly. "You promised me anything I wanted."

"What's bothering you?" Lucien asked, brushing his fingers along her cheek.

"I want to destroy Evelyn so thoroughly that she'll never dare show her face in public again!" Though Evelyn's car was long gone, Vanessa still glared at the empty road, her eyes burning with resentment.

Lucien followed her gaze, then smirked. "I heard you two were classmates once. Is that true?"

"Yes," Vanessa spat, not bothering to hide her bitterness. "And I hate her more than anyone."

"Why?"

"Back in university, every professor adored her. They handed her every opportunity—why? I was just as talented! In every competition we entered together, she always outshone me. And when it came to love—" She cut herself off, then hissed, "I can never win as long as she exists. She steals everything from me!"

She clenched her fists. "You saw it yourself. Why did we have to run into her here in Silverpine Valley? She flew in first-class, rode in a luxury car—how does she still command such respect when her reputation is in ruins? She's even tangled in a lawsuit! It's not fair!"

Lucien chuckled, sliding his hand to her shoulder, kneading the tension there. "She may be luckier than most, but you're not doing so badly yourself. You found me."

At that, Vanessa softened slightly, leaning into his embrace. "You'll help me, won't you?"

"I told you—you'll get what you want, as long as you keep me satisfied," he murmured, pressing a kiss to her hair.

"Yes," Vanessa whispered obediently.

The car rolled steadily along the road, but the city's skyline never appeared. Instead, endless fields stretched around them.

"It's so far," Vanessa muttered, frowning. She didn’t remember the drive being this long earlier. Just then, the car slowed to a stop.

"What's wrong? Did the car break down?" She glanced around nervously at the desolate landscape.

Lucien turned off the engine, one hand still on the wheel as he looked at her.

"L-Lucien?" That familiar glint in his eyes made her pulse spike. A bad feeling coiled in her stomach.

"Vanessa," he purred, licking his lips.

She pressed herself against the door, trembling. "Lucien, this place is too isolated. I'm scared. Let's go back to the hotel first. We can—"

Before she could finish, he yanked her wrist, pulling her close.

"Doing it at the hotel is so predictable. Don't you think new settings are more exciting?"

She swallowed hard, forcing patience into her voice. "Lucien, this isn't safe. Someone could come by. Let's just—"

"Isn't that what makes it thrilling?" His eyes gleamed, utterly indifferent to her fear.

"No, Lucien. I'm scared. Let's go back—"
###Chapter 160

Before Vanessa could complete her sentence, Lucien abruptly released his hold on her.

His expression darkened visibly.

This reaction made Vanessa's anxiety spike. "I'm sorry, Lucien. I just—"

He turned sharply, his glasses glinting dangerously in the dim light. His icy stare sent shivers down her spine. "Vanessa, darling," he drawled, lighting a cigarette with deliberate slowness. "I made it clear—you play by my rules if you want my help." He exhaled a cloud of smoke directly into her face. "You're being rather disappointing tonight."

The acrid smoke made her cough violently, but she clenched her fists. She'd sacrificed too much already to back out now.

Forcing a sweet smile, she reached for his arm. "Don't be angry, mon cher. It was just... sudden." She lowered her lashes demurely. "But you're right—we should seize the moment. Whatever you desire, I'm yours."

"That's my girl." He traced her jawline with nicotine-stained fingers before crushing his lips against hers. The taste of tobacco and dominance made her stomach churn, but she endured it silently. This was the price of her ambitions.

When they reached The Chateau Royale, Vanessa slumped against the leather seat, every muscle screaming in protest. No matter how many times she told herself this was temporary, her body kept score of the violations.

"Ma chérie, we've arrived," Lucien purred, his public persona of charm sliding back into place like a well-worn mask.

She forced herself upright. "I'll... go to my room first."

His hand shot out to stop her. "Our room, darling."

Though repulsed, she batted her eyelashes. "Lucien, please—I need to rest."

"Of course." He kissed her cheek with exaggerated tenderness before releasing her.

Vanessa practically staggered into the grand lobby, only to freeze mid-step.

Dominic stood silhouetted against the marble columns, his stormy gaze pinning her in place. The air crackled with unspoken fury.

Her blood turned to ice. "D-Dominic?"
###Chapter 161

"Where have you been?" Dominic's voice was low, edged with something that sent a shiver down Vanessa's spine.

Guilt twisted inside her. She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, forcing a smile. "I—I visited the nursery today! Learned so much, thanks to Lucien."

Her mind raced. Lying outright would only make things worse. Better to offer a half-truth, something believable enough to ease his suspicions.

"You two seem awfully close," he muttered, his tone darkening.

Vanessa swallowed. How much had he seen? How long had he been watching them?

But as long as she didn’t confess, he couldn’t possibly know the full truth.

Her arrangement with Lucien was purely transactional. He would never give her the love she craved, and she would never give up the security Dominic offered.

She stepped closer, wrapping her arms around his. Resting her head against his shoulder, she peered up at him through her lashes. "Are you jealous?"

He scoffed but didn’t deny it.

"I know you’re just worried," she murmured, pressing closer. "But this is strictly business. You couldn’t come with me, so now you’re sulking. Now that you’re here, you’ll see there’s nothing to worry about."

She pinched his nose playfully, her expression softening into something sweet and obedient. The tension in his jaw eased slightly.

"Really?" His voice was rough. "Nothing between you two?"

"Oh, there is!" She grinned, mischief flashing in her eyes. "We did so much together. Go ahead, be mad!"

Before he could react, she slipped free and darted toward the elevator, laughter trailing behind her.

Dominic exhaled, the anger draining from him. Maybe he’d overreacted.

He’d rushed to Silverpine Valley the moment he’d wrapped things up in Veridian City, only to find Vanessa gone. His contact had mentioned she’d left with Lucien hours ago—without a company car.

That had set him on edge.

He’d waited at the hotel entrance, watching, calculating. When they finally returned, at least they hadn’t walked in together.

No lingering touches. No whispered words.

And now, her teasing reassurances made him feel foolish for doubting her.

He followed her upstairs, stepping into the room just as she closed the door behind her. Before she could turn, he caught her wrist, pressing her back against the wood.

"Vanessa," he murmured, lowering his head.

She stiffened, her hand flying up to block him.

His brows furrowed. "Vanessa?"

"I—I just got back from the nursery," she stammered, forcing a laugh. "I’m filthy. Let me shower first."

She ducked under his arm, pressing a quick kiss to his lips before slipping past him. "You’re here now. It’s not like I can run."

The bathroom door clicked shut. Water rushed in the pipes.

Dominic exhaled, running a hand through his hair.

Something still didn’t feel right.
###Chapter 162

Dominic sensed something was off, but Vanessa's demeanor remained unchanged.

His gaze swept the room, landing on her phone peeking out from the fallen bag beside the massive bed. With a quick glance at the closed bathroom door, he strode over and picked it up.

The lock screen password was still the same. He easily accessed her WhatsApp, finding Lucien's contact. The chat was empty—no messages. He scoured her gallery, texts, and call logs, but everything appeared normal. Dominic checked every possible corner of her phone but found nothing suspicious.

Was he overreacting? Doubt clouded his mind.

Just then, the sound of running water ceased. He hastily locked the phone and slipped it back into the bag. As he turned, Vanessa emerged in her silk pajamas, her damp hair clinging to her shoulders.

"You dressed so fast?" He feigned nonchalance, pulling her into his arms. The scent of her shower gel enveloped him. "You’ll just have to take it off again soon."

Vanessa stiffened slightly. She had anticipated this the moment she stepped into the shower. It had been weeks since they’d last seen each other, and with him traveling all this way, she knew what he wanted.

But not tonight.

She couldn’t risk intimacy—not when he might discover the truth. Yet outright refusal would only fuel his suspicion. So she had prepared a countermeasure.

She tilted her neck, letting him press kisses along her skin. Just as his hands began to wander, she pulled away abruptly.

Dominic’s eyes darkened with frustration. "Vanessa," he growled, his voice laced with warning. "You’ve never turned me down before."

She pouted, feigning reluctance. "I wasn’t pregnant before."

His breath hitched. "You—you’re sure?"

She lowered her lashes, nodding shyly. One hand drifted to her stomach. "I missed my period. I took another test earlier. It’s positive."

All his anger and suspicion evaporated. He guided her to the bed, helping her sit before gently easing her onto the pillows.

"Why are you still traveling in this condition?" His voice softened with concern. "You should be resting. Are you uncomfortable? Hungry? Should I order something?"

Vanessa arched a brow. "Now you remember to ask if I’m hungry?"

"Your health comes first." He squeezed her hand. "We’ll talk later. I’ll order room service—no takeout. You need proper food."

She watched as he called the hotel kitchen, meticulously listing her preferences and dietary restrictions. His voice was tender, his attention unwavering.

Vanessa exhaled quietly, relief settling in her chest.

For now, she had bought herself time.
###Chapter 163

After placing their meal order, Dominic remained seated on the edge of the bed, his fingers still entwined with Vanessa’s.

"Is there anything else you'd like? Something sweet, perhaps?" His voice was soft, laced with concern.

Vanessa smiled, squeezing his hand lightly. "I'm fine. It's still early in the pregnancy—I'm not that fragile."

Dominic frowned. "Of course you are. Pregnant women should be pampered."

Seeing his serious expression, Vanessa couldn’t resist teasing him. "Oh? So you’re only being this attentive because I’m carrying your child? If I weren’t pregnant, you wouldn’t care, would you?"

His eyes widened in mock offense. "You know that’s not true. I’ve always treated you well."

When he caught the mischievous glint in her eyes, he realized she was playing with him. With a low chuckle, he swatted her hip lightly. "Cheeky. Since when did you become such a tease?"

Vanessa laughed, dodging away. "Mercy! I was only joking." Then, her smile faltered slightly. "But… do you think this is bad timing?"

Dominic’s amusement vanished. "What do you mean?"

She sighed. "DR Holdings is just stabilizing. There’s still so much to handle. And… we haven’t even had our wedding yet."

His expression softened. "Is that what’s worrying you?" Leaning in, he pressed a kiss to her forehead. "Don’t. I have everything planned. You’ll have the grandest wedding Sapphine has ever seen."

The truth was, he had hesitated before. Evelyn had meant something to him—enough that he hadn’t been ready to let go. But now that she was gone, Dominic knew where his heart truly lay.

Vanessa had stood by him through everything—his temper, his failures, even when he didn’t deserve her loyalty.

She’s the one I want.

Pulling her into his arms, he murmured, "I know these past months haven’t been easy for you."

Her breath hitched. The words struck deeper than she expected.

"So you were aware?" she muttered, pouting. "I thought you were completely oblivious."

"Of course I knew." His grip tightened. "And I’m sorry. I’ll make it up to you—I promise."

Vanessa tilted her head up, meeting his gaze. "Better not break that promise."

"Never." The certainty in his voice made her heart flutter.

As she laughed, Dominic felt a familiar warmth spread through him. Between the factory chaos and their time apart, it had been too long since he’d held her like this.

Too long since he’d reminded her—and himself—just how much she meant to him.
###Chapter 164

Vanessa still refused him, even as Dominic pleaded desperately.

"You just promised not to make me suffer anymore," she said, her voice trembling. "Don’t you realize how fragile I am right now? Are you really going to prioritize your selfish desires over my safety—over our baby’s safety? What if something happens to me? Would you be able to live with yourself?"

Her eyes glistened with unshed tears as she turned her face away, her lower lip quivering. The sight of her distress snapped Dominic back to his senses, extinguishing the fire in his veins.

"I’m sorry," he murmured, guilt heavy in his voice. "I lost control. It won’t happen again."

After a tense silence, he stood abruptly. "You should rest. Room service will be here soon." His voice was rough, strained. "I’ll go take a shower."

Without another word, he strode into the bathroom. The sound of running water followed—cold water, no doubt, meant to douse the heat she had stirred in him.

Vanessa exhaled shakily, pressing a hand to her stomach.

She should feel guilty. Dominic had always been good to her. He’d flown across the country just to see her, hadn’t he?

But then again… she couldn’t undo what had already happened with Lucien.

She had paid a price for that night. And if she was going to suffer, she deserved something in return. Their arrangement was nothing more than a transaction—one that would end the moment she got what she wanted.

If she played her cards right, she could keep both men in her orbit without either of them realizing the truth.

Her fingers curled protectively over her abdomen. She hadn’t decided yet whether to keep the baby.

But Dominic’s reaction tonight told her everything she needed to know.

He wanted this child.

And that made it valuable.

Meanwhile, Victoria Sterling dragged herself back to the hotel, exhaustion weighing on her limbs.

She should have collapsed into bed immediately.

Instead, she booted up her laptop, determined to clear her backlog of work emails.

Evelyn Carter watched her from the sofa, idly scrolling through her phone. She didn’t want to interrupt, so she kept quiet—until a message notification lit up her screen.

Her lips curved.

She tapped out a quick reply to Alexander Kensington:

"I’m back."

Working alongside Victoria had given Evelyn a newfound appreciation for her dedication.

Victoria was diligent. Passionate. Meticulous.

She just… lacked that innate spark.

The perfume industry was cruel that way. Some people were born with an extraordinary gift—like Evelyn herself, or the legendary perfumers who dominated the field.

Others had just enough talent to scrape by.

Vanessa Blake fell into that category.

But where Vanessa squandered her potential, chasing shortcuts and schemes, Victoria worked. She studied. She practiced. She compared formulas, analyzed data, and refined her craft with relentless discipline.

That was why, when Evelyn had altered Vanessa’s formula before leaving DR Holdings, Vanessa had been powerless to fix it.

She hadn’t put in the effort to truly understand her own work.

Victoria, on the other hand?

She would have noticed the discrepancy immediately.

Evelyn’s gaze flickered back to her phone as another message came through.

Alexander’s response was brief.

"Good. Missed you."

A slow smile spread across her face.
###Chapter 165

Alexander's response came swiftly, just a single word: "Yeah."

Evelyn couldn't help but smile as she read it.

She kicked off her shoes and curled up on the sofa, typing back, "I went to Magnolia Grove today. Finally found what I was looking for."

"Crimson Mahogany?" Alexander replied.

Evelyn's smile faltered. She pursed her lips and typed, "How do you always know everything?"

"Because it's in the reports," he answered, adding a shrugging emoji at the end.

She read the message twice before it clicked. Of course he knew—she had spent a significant sum from DR Holdings' funds to acquire the rare wood.

The finance department would have logged the purchase, requiring approval from both the finance manager and the director. Still, she was surprised at how quickly Alexander had been informed.

In a normal company, it might take days for executives to catch wind of such a transaction. But Alexander? His information network was terrifyingly efficient.

"What's wrong?" he asked when she didn’t respond.

"Nothing," she typed quickly, glancing at Victoria. Her colleague was absorbed in her laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard as she replied to emails.

Evelyn lowered her head, refocusing on her phone. "When are you leaving?"

"Don’t worry. I’ll be out soon." His next message made her roll her eyes. "Why are you so eager to get rid of me? Using me and then tossing me aside?"

She scoffed. Dramatic much?

Mimicking his tone, she replied, "Yep. I’m done. Are you?"

Let’s see how you handle that.

Alexander chuckled. "Why don’t we keep trying?"

"Fine. Let’s try this again," she shot back.

He could practically picture her—flustered but determined, typing furiously on her phone. The thought warmed him. He missed her. The sooner he wrapped up here, the sooner he could go home.

Finally, he looked up from his phone—only to find his entire team staring at him like he’d grown a second head.

He frowned. "What’s with the looks? Don’t you have work to do?"

"Y-Yes, sir!" they stammered in unison.

"I’m leaving," he announced, rising from his seat. He had no intention of staying a second longer.

One brave employee dared to speak up before he walked out. "Sir, about the collaboration—"

"Stick to the original proposal. I don’t negotiate with people who try to lowball us. If they accept, we proceed. If not, we find another partner."

It was just one of Celestia Group’s countless projects. Losing it wouldn’t make a dent in their operations.

Without another word, Alexander strode out—completely unaware of the wildfire of gossip he’d left behind.

"Did you see that?" someone whispered. "Mr. Kensington was smiling!"
###Chapter 166

"That's ridiculous! Of course Mr. Kensington smiles!"

"No, you're missing the point. It was a real smile!"

"Obviously it was real! Why would he fake it? Be careful what you say—if Mr. Kensington hears you, you're finished!"

"I'm telling you, he usually smirks, and it's terrifying. When he does that, someone's about to get destroyed. But this time? It was genuine. Like... normal. You know?" He scanned the room, desperate for backup.

The others stayed silent, but they were all thinking the same thing. Alexander Kensington smiling during a meeting? And not his usual chilling smirk? It was... unsettling.

Evelyn had been waiting for a reply from Alexander, but her phone remained stubbornly silent. She kept rereading their last exchange, her cheeks burning hotter with each word. God, I sound just like him. Why did I send something so embarrassing?

"What's wrong? Why are you shaking your head like that?" Victoria had finished her work and was now leaning over Evelyn's desk, curious.

"Nothing! Just... decompressing. Checking my phone." Evelyn quickly locked the screen. "You're done?"

"Yep." Victoria plopped into the chair beside her. "I just submitted the purchase order for Magnolia Grove. Guess what?"

"What?"

"Approved. No revisions, no questions—just approved." Victoria clapped her hands together. "I've worked here for years, and I've never had a purchase order go through this smoothly. It's a miracle!"

"Right." Evelyn already knew it wouldn't be an issue. How could there be one when the CEO himself had already signed off on it?

Victoria narrowed her eyes. "Okay, be honest with me. Is your boyfriend secretly an executive here?"

"Uh... no." Technically not wrong. Alexander wasn't just an executive—he was the head of Celestia Group. The owner.

"Really?" Victoria leaned in. "Because first, our business trip was way too luxurious. Then, everything we submit gets approved instantly. And now this? You can tell me. I won’t say a word."

"He's not an executive, Victoria. I promise I'll tell you when the time is right, okay?" Evelyn bit her lip.

If she let Victoria keep guessing, she might actually figure it out—and the thought sent a chill down Evelyn’s spine. It wasn’t that she didn’t trust her friend, but the more people who knew about her and Alexander, the higher the risk of exposure. And she wasn’t ready for that.

Alexander’s position was too high-profile. If their relationship got out, the fallout would be massive. Not to mention, the Hawthorne family couldn’t find out. The only way to keep it under wraps was to keep Victoria in the dark—for now.

Victoria studied her for a long moment before sighing. "Fine. But you promised you’d introduce me when the time comes. No backing out."

"I won’t." Evelyn exhaled in relief.

"Good. Now, are you hungry? Let’s grab dinner." Victoria stretched. "You mentioned that new place you wanted to try. Wanna go?"

Evelyn grinned. "Definitely. Let’s go."
###Chapter 167

The cold water did little to ease the tension coiled in Dominic's muscles, but it helped clear his mind. Stepping out of the shower, he toweled off and glanced toward the bed, where Vanessa lay curled beneath the sheets, her breathing slow and even. The food he'd ordered sat untouched on the table, the fragrant aroma of roasted chicken and herbs lingering in the air.

He hadn't eaten since arriving, too preoccupied with work—and now, with her. His stomach had been giving him trouble lately, sharp pains flaring up whenever he skipped meals or ate too much. He forced down a few bites, careful not to overdo it, then turned his attention back to Vanessa.

She snored softly, a sound he'd never heard from her before. It was faint, almost endearing, but it only deepened the guilt gnawing at him. The dark circles under her eyes were impossible to ignore. Vanessa, who never left the house without flawless makeup, now looked exhausted beyond caring.

Dominic clenched his jaw. He shouldn't have doubted her earlier.

Moving quietly, he slipped into bed beside her, wrapping an arm around her waist. He pressed his lips to the back of her neck, inhaling the faint scent of her shampoo. This was what he wanted—her, a family, a future where they built something together.

Evelyn Carter's help wasn't irreplaceable. There were others who could fill that role. But Dominic preferred a wife who was soft-spoken, obedient—nothing like Evelyn.

The memory of her in that alley sent a phantom ache through his neck. She hadn't been the composed, controlled woman he knew. She'd been something else entirely.

Vanessa stirred in his arms, shifting until she faced him. She rubbed her eyes, blinking up at him with drowsy confusion. "How long was I out?"

"Long enough," he murmured, brushing a strand of hair from her face. "Are you hungry? There's still food."

The mention of food made her stomach growl. She sat up, padding over to the table where Dominic had separated her portion onto a clean plate. She picked up her fork, but before she could take a bite, her phone buzzed against her thigh.

Her fingers tightened around the device. She'd been careful to keep it hidden, but now, with Dominic watching, she hesitated.

A quick glance confirmed it was Lucien Dubois.

Come to the hotel restaurant. Now.

Vanessa's throat went dry. She typed a quick reply. I'm going to bed.

The response was immediate. Are you refusing me?

A chill ran down her spine. Even through text, his displeasure was palpable. She wanted to say no, to ignore him—but she didn't dare.

She deleted the messages, erasing any trace of their exchange. Then, with a sigh, she set her fork down and turned to Dominic.

"What's wrong?" he asked, frowning at her untouched plate. "Not hungry anymore?"

She forced a smile. "Just tired."

Dominic studied her for a long moment before pulling her back into his arms. "Then sleep."

But as Vanessa closed her eyes, all she could think about was Lucien waiting downstairs—and what would happen if she didn't go.
###Chapter 168

Vanessa shook her head, "Perhaps it's just too stuffy in here. Let's take a walk and grab a bite outside?"

"Alright, let me change first. Anywhere specific in mind?" Dominic stood, smoothing his shirt.

"I'm still exhausted, so I don't want to go far. How about the hotel's restaurant?" Vanessa lowered her gaze, feigning weariness.

"Perfect." Dominic agreed without hesitation.

After changing, they made their way to the restaurant. Vanessa's mind was consumed with thoughts of Lucien, and the moment they stepped inside, her eyes immediately found his table. Her grip on Dominic's arm tightened as she forced a composed expression.

"A table for two," Dominic told the host.

They were led toward the back when Vanessa pretended to notice something. She nudged Dominic lightly. "Isn't that Mr. Dubois over there?"

Truthfully, Dominic wasn't thrilled about running into Lucien. But given their family ties and the fact that Lucien had helped resolve DR Holdings' crisis, ignoring him would be impolite.

Though he didn't particularly like Lucien, Dominic respected his expertise. If Lucien ever agreed to work for DR Holdings, their production line issues would vanish overnight.

Swallowing his pride, Dominic nodded. "Let's go say hello."

They approached Lucien's table.

"Mr. Dubois," Dominic greeted smoothly. "What a pleasant surprise."

Vanessa offered a polite nod.

Surprise? Lucien's lips curved into an amused smirk as his gaze flickered between them.

"Mr. Reeves," he remarked dryly. "Here to accompany your... girlfriend?"

Dominic slid Vanessa's hand from his arm, interlacing their fingers instead. "Naturally. Vanessa is stunning—this is her first extended trip away. How could I not worry?" He turned to her with a smile. "In fact, I'm here to propose. We're getting married soon."

Vanessa stiffened. Though they'd attended countless events together, Dominic had never publicly claimed her as his. This sudden declaration was nothing more than a power play. A flicker of warmth touched her heart, but it was quickly smothered by humiliation.

Dominic was oblivious. Lucien didn’t care who she belonged to—their arrangement was purely transactional. He had no intention of stealing her from Dominic, nor did he see her as anything more than a business asset. Dominic's display of dominance was laughable.

When Vanessa glanced at Lucien, his smirk confirmed her thoughts. He was utterly unfazed.

"Really? Then congratulations are in order." Lucien leaned back, swirling his wine. "Allow me to cover your dinner—consider it an engagement gift."

Dominic, mistaking his sincerity, nodded. "Why not?"

With that, he guided Vanessa into the seat opposite Lucien.
###Chapter 169

The waiter placed the dishes before them, and Vanessa couldn't tear her gaze away from the steak in front of her. She meticulously sliced it with her knife, cutting it into precise, bite-sized pieces. In contrast, the two men beside her ate with far more ease.

"I haven’t had the chance to properly thank you for your assistance, Mr. Dubois," Dominic began, raising his glass. "Your notes were invaluable. After adjusting the formula as you suggested, we stabilized the essential oil production. The factory is running smoothly again, though the delay did set back our deliveries for a few days."

He took a sip before continuing. "We managed to compensate for the lost time, and thankfully, our clients were understanding. This wouldn’t have been possible without you. I’m truly grateful."

Lucien offered a faint smile, lifting his own glass. "It was nothing."

The clink of crystal made Vanessa stiffen. Sensing her tension, Dominic immediately set his drink down. "Are you alright?"

She shook her head, forcing a smile. "Just a little tired, that’s all. Please, don’t let me interrupt your conversation."

"You should eat," Dominic urged, nodding toward her plate. "Don’t just cut it—actually take a bite." He speared a piece of steak with his fork and held it out to her.

Vanessa hesitated. Normally, she wouldn’t think twice, but she could feel Lucien’s gaze on her from the corner of her eye.

To be exact, he was watching her. His lips curved into a smile, but it sent an uneasy shiver down her spine.

"It’s fine, Dom. I can feed myself," she protested.

Dominic didn’t relent. "Come on, just one bite."

Reluctantly, she parted her lips and accepted the morsel. Pleased, Dominic continued feeding her until she had eaten nearly half the steak.

Then, without warning, Vanessa pressed a hand to her mouth. "N-No more. I really can’t."

She pushed back from the table and hurried toward the restroom.

Dominic chuckled lightly, turning back to Lucien. "Forgive her. Pregnancy does that sometimes."

Lucien’s eyebrows lifted. He studied Dominic for a long moment before a slow, triumphant smirk spread across his face. He raised his glass again. "Is that so? Congratulations."

Dominic blinked, taken aback. He had expected resistance—some flicker of displeasure, at least. Instead, Lucien seemed genuinely pleased.

Maybe I was wrong about him, Dominic thought.

Perhaps he had misjudged Lucien entirely.
###Chapter 170

Dominic Reeves thought, Lucien has fame, status, power, and wealth—he could have any woman he desires. Besides, my mother introduced him to me, so he must be her friend. Why would he be interested in Vanessa?

With that realization, Dominic relaxed. He raised his glass with a smile and said, "Thank you!" before downing his wine in one go.

Lucien's lips curved subtly, his gaze hidden behind the glint of his gold-framed glasses. "By the way, Mr. Reeves, how long do you plan to stay in the country? I’m curious if you’re considering expanding your business here."

Now that Dominic had dismissed his suspicions, he shifted the conversation, eager to secure Lucien’s expertise for himself. "I haven’t decided yet," Lucien replied, swirling the wine in his glass before taking a slow sip.

Dominic deliberately misinterpreted his answer. "If that’s the case, does that mean you’re open to opportunities? If so, I’d love to know which local companies interest you. Would you consider joining DR Holdings?"

Lucien smirked, tilting his head slightly. Does he seriously think his company is worth my time? Where does he get the confidence to even ask?

With an amused lift of his brow, Lucien countered, "Oh? And what kind of salary are we discussing, Mr. Reeves?"

Dominic wasn’t oblivious to the mockery in Lucien’s tone, but he didn’t let it faze him. It was true—DR Holdings couldn’t compete with the financial might of industry giants.

Yet, sitting across from Lucien Dubois, Dominic saw an opportunity. "Admittedly, our resources are limited. We may not be able to match the offers from larger firms."

Lucien swirled his wine lazily, his attention drifting. "Then why should I choose your company?"

Dominic leaned forward, his voice persuasive. "Because while the pay may not be the highest, we offer something others can’t. Genevieve introduced you, and you’ve already helped us. That makes you a friend. Name anything you want, and we’ll make it happen."

He continued, "You’ll answer to no one but me. Complete creative freedom, no corporate red tape. No other company can promise you that."

Pausing for effect, Dominic added confidently, "At your level, it’s not just about money—it’s about influence and legacy. I can give you both."

He spoke with conviction, certain his offer was irresistible. After all, who else could guarantee Lucien total autonomy?

Lucien set his glass down with deliberate precision, his expression unreadable. "You’re mistaken."

Dominic frowned.

"First," Lucien said, his tone sharp, "money is important. I became a perfumer to earn it. Are you telling me you built your company out of charity?"

Dominic’s smile faltered.

"Second," Lucien continued, "every company I’ve worked with has given me creative control. You’re not offering anything special."

His words hung in the air, stripping Dominic’s confidence bare.
###Chapter 171

Ignoring Dominic’s flustered expression, Lucien held up three fingers with a cold smirk. "Third," he said, his voice dripping with disdain, "I despise making friends."

With that, he straightened his jacket and rose from his seat. "I’ll settle the bill. Enjoy your meal."

The insult was deliberate, calculated.

Dominic had been hesitant earlier, trying to negotiate, but now fury burned through him. He had assumed their past connection would earn him some courtesy, but Lucien had dismissed him without a second thought.

Arrogant bastard.

Dominic downed his wine, the bitterness on his tongue matching his thoughts. He’s skilled, but he’s not the only master perfumer in the world. Far from it.

Glancing around to see if Lucien had truly left, his gaze landed on a familiar silhouette.

Evelyn?

He had nearly forgotten she was here. Vanessa had complained about her presence the moment she arrived.

Narrowing his eyes, Dominic studied Evelyn’s profile from his seat. She was alone, fingers tapping rapidly on her phone, absorbed in whatever conversation she was having.

A slow smirk curled his lips.

Before Vanessa could return from the restroom, he pushed back his chair and strode toward Evelyn.

Evelyn was mid-laugh, texting Alexander, when a shadow fell over her table.

"Fancy seeing you here," Dominic drawled, sliding into the seat across from her without invitation.

She startled, jerking back instinctively.

Dominic’s smirk deepened. Good. She still reacts to me.

If Evelyn knew what he was thinking, she’d have rolled her eyes. She wasn’t startled by him—just his sudden, unwelcome presence.

"What a surprise," she said flatly, her fingers tightening around her phone.

"Are you dining alone?" Dominic leaned forward, deliberately blocking her line of sight.

Evelyn’s jaw clenched. Now she understood Alexander’s cryptic text:

Beware of the dog. It might bite you.

She shot back a reply under the table.

You could’ve warned me sooner.

Alexander’s response was immediate, laced with amusement.

Did it bite already?
###Chapter 172

"No, but it's irritating. Still, you don't need to come and help me chase the dog."

"Are you sure you don't want my help? Because I’d be happy to."

Alexander was more than willing—eager, even—to make their relationship public.

"No! Absolutely not! I refuse!" Evelyn repeated firmly, her cheeks flushing.

Alexander chuckled, his voice warm. "I’ll always be here for you."

Of course, she couldn’t actually ask him to intervene. Dominic wouldn’t dare cause a scene in such a public place. But hearing Alexander’s reassurance eased the tension in her chest, and a soft smile curved her lips.

Dominic, watching her from across the room, felt a strange dizziness. He was so accustomed to Evelyn—her relentless work schedule, the faint scent of essential oils clinging to her clothes, her perpetually serious expression. It had all become mundane to him.

How could a woman be so dull? No charm, no allure, no softness. He had only tolerated her because of her usefulness—her willingness to help him without question, her unmatched skill in perfumery.

But that smile…

It caught him off guard.

Sweet. Playful. Was this really Evelyn? Who was she smiling at like that?

She sat right in front of him, yet she hadn’t even noticed his presence. Her attention was entirely absorbed by her phone, her expression radiant.

It infuriated him.

She was ignoring him.

No, she was pretending to ignore him.

When he thought about it, the answer was obvious—she was doing this on purpose. Earlier, when their eyes had met, he’d seen the flicker of panic in her gaze. If she truly didn’t care, she wouldn’t have reacted at all.

This was a game.

She was playing hard to get.

Dominic cleared his throat and rapped his knuckles sharply against the table.

Evelyn finally looked up.

Satisfaction curled through him.

See? You can’t resist.

"Evelyn," he said, his tone deliberately casual. "I’m talking to you. Can’t you hear me?"

She arched a brow, her voice cool. "We’re not on familiar terms."

Dominic’s jaw tightened.

"Evelyn, why are you acting like this? Even if we’re not together anymore, we can still be civil. You got your revenge—isn’t that enough? Vanessa and I made mistakes, but we’ve already dropped the lawsuit. Can’t you just let it go? Move on?"

Evelyn stared at him, wide-eyed, as if he were some bizarre creature she’d never encountered before.

What kind of twisted logic is that?

Who did he think he was?

How dare he suggest she just forget what they’d done?

"I’m sorry," she said, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "I don’t quite follow. Revenge? What revenge? You make it sound like I’m some kind of avenging angel, but I assure you—I’ve done nothing of the sort."

Dominic leaned back, one arm draped over the back of her chair, his gaze piercing.

"Evelyn, there’s no point in keeping up this act. I’m trying to make peace here, but you’re twisting everything. Tell me—did you really never tamper with the company’s formulas while you were there? That fake formula you provided for the essential oil—wasn’t that deliberate?"

His voice was smug, as if he already had proof of her guilt.
###Chapter 173

Evelyn Carter sat up and regarded Dominic Reeves with an amused tilt of her head. She arched a brow, her tone laced with deliberate patience.

"Mr. Reeves," she began, "if memory serves, you've been telling everyone that Vanessa Blake was the mastermind behind DR Holdings' perfumes."

A slow, knowing smile curved her lips.

"Then, pray tell, how could I possibly have tampered with your formula?"

She leaned forward slightly, her gaze sharp.

"Besides, if Ms. Blake truly created those perfumes, shouldn't she be the one capable of making adjustments? How does this equate to my revenge?"

Dominic had anticipated this reaction. He lowered his voice, glancing around to ensure no one was within earshot.

"Evelyn," he murmured, "there's no audience here. Drop the act. We both know the truth about that formula."

His jaw tightened.

"I admit—I used you. And for that, I am sorry."

His tone shifted, turning almost conciliatory.

"But you've nearly ruined my company. Now that you've moved on to Phoenix Labs and are thriving there, I won’t demand much. Let’s just... forgive and forget. What do you say?"

This was his grand concession—his magnanimous offer. No legal repercussions for her actions, and in return, she was expected to erase his past betrayals from memory.

Evelyn stared at him, her expression unreadable.

For a moment, she simply studied him, as if seeing him for the first time.

The sheer audacity of this man.

No remorse. No genuine regret. Just the gall to paint himself as the wounded party.

Dominic Reeves was, without a doubt, the most shameless man she'd ever met.

A cold laugh escaped her.

"So now you're admitting I was the one behind all of DR Holdings' previous perfumes and essential oils?" she countered, sidestepping his so-called truce.

Dominic opened his mouth—

"Evelyn! There you are!"

A voice cut through the tension like a blade.

Dominic stiffened as a woman strode up, her hand landing playfully on Evelyn’s shoulder.

"Got you!" she declared, grinning. "Now you have to introduce me to your—"

Her words died as she turned and spotted Dominic.

Her smile froze.

Then twisted into something far less friendly.

"Oh. You."

Victoria Sterling knew exactly who he was.

Not Evelyn’s boyfriend.

Her ex.

The smirk that curled her lips was pure venom.

"To what do we owe the honor of DR Holdings' esteemed director gracing us with his presence?"

Dominic blinked, taken aback by the sheer hostility radiating off her.

He didn’t even know this woman.

Had they met before?

No. He was certain they hadn’t.

So why was she looking at him like he’d personally wronged her?

Unless...

His gaze flicked to Evelyn.

No. That couldn’t be it.

Evelyn had only joined Phoenix Labs recently. There was no way she’d formed such a close bond with someone so quickly.

And this woman—whoever she was—didn’t strike him as the type to associate with someone of Evelyn’s... background.

"Hello," he said smoothly, extending a hand. "Dominic Reeves. And you are?"

Victoria ignored the gesture.

She flashed him a perfunctory smile before turning back to Evelyn, her tone brightening instantly.

"I have the most unbelievable news for you!"

Evelyn’s lips twitched.

Victoria’s sudden appearance had derailed her original plan, but she wasn’t complaining.

Anything to escape this insufferable man.

"What is it?" she asked, genuinely curious.

Victoria opened her mouth—then paused.

She frowned.

"Wait. I—" She groaned, pressing a hand to her forehead. "Ugh, I forgot!"

She’d been so excited to finally catch Evelyn with her mystery boyfriend.

Instead, she’d walked in on Dominic Reeves.

The sheer disappointment had wiped her mind blank.

Her glare snapped back to Dominic.

"This is your fault," she accused.

Dominic could only stare, utterly speechless.
###Chapter 174

"Mr. Reeves, shouldn't you be with your girlfriend right now? Why are you bothering Evelyn? She's part of our team now and no longer works for you. If I were you, I'd focus on my own affairs before losing something irreplaceable."

Victoria's icy tone caught Evelyn off guard. What did she mean by losing something valuable? Dominic was equally stunned by the unexpected hostility. He didn't know this woman, and her sharp words left him momentarily speechless.

"Oh! I just remembered!" After silencing Dominic, Victoria finally recalled what she had meant to tell Evelyn. Evelyn leaned in curiously. "What is it?"

Just as Victoria was about to speak, she noticed Dominic still lingering. She turned back to him with a dismissive wave. "Mr. Reeves, don’t you have somewhere else to be? We’re rather busy here, so if you wouldn’t mind?"

Before he could respond, she added, "If you have business with us, schedule an appointment through proper channels. First of all, we’re competitors. Second, isn’t it unprofessional to eavesdrop on confidential company matters?"

Dominic was speechless. Eavesdrop? He had merely been trying to speak with an old acquaintance! But since Victoria made her disdain so clear, he wasn’t about to sit there and endure it. There would always be another opportunity.

"Fine, ladies. I’ll leave you to it. Evelyn, we’ll catch up another time," he said smoothly, rising to his feet.

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. As if I’d ever want to.

Once he left, Dominic remembered Vanessa still hadn’t returned. He hurried toward the restrooms but spotted her emerging slowly before he reached them. Though she moved carefully, her color had improved slightly—though she still looked drained.

"Vanessa! Are you alright? Let’s get you home," he said, rushing to support her. Guilt gnawed at him, assuming her pallor was due to morning sickness.

Vanessa didn’t resist, simply nodding as he guided her out of the restaurant.

"Now, tell me," Evelyn urged, finally turning her full attention back to Victoria. The couple’s departure had been distracting, but now she was eager for answers.

Victoria smirked, taking a deliberate sip of her sparkling water. "Guess what I just saw in the restroom?"

Evelyn blinked. This was a side of Victoria she hadn’t seen before—the poised, no-nonsense executive now brimming with gossipy excitement.

This is from N?velDrama.Org.

Victoria leaned in, lowering her voice. "You won’t believe who was in there looking absolutely wrecked."

Evelyn’s brows shot up. The intrigue was irresistible.

Victoria’s grin widened. "Vanessa Blake wasn’t just sick. She was crying."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Crying? That didn’t fit the composed, ruthless woman she knew.

Victoria’s eyes gleamed with satisfaction. "And that’s not all. She was on the phone with someone—someone she called ‘Alexander.’"

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Alexander Kensington?

Victoria leaned back, swirling her drink. "Now that is a story I’d love to hear."

Evelyn’s mind raced. What game was Vanessa playing? And why did Dominic Reeves seem completely in the dark?

The pieces were shifting. And Evelyn had a feeling the real drama was just beginning.
###Chapter 175

Victoria lowered her voice and whispered to Evelyn, "I just caught a secret affair in action." Evelyn arched a brow, disapproval flashing in her eyes as she shook her head. "I didn’t realize you had a habit of eavesdropping."

"What’s with that tone? Don’t judge me!" Victoria huffed, crossing her arms. "I only paid attention because it involves someone connected to you. Why would I care about random people? And trust me, it wasn’t a pretty sight."

Evelyn blinked. "Connected to me?" She pointed at herself.

"Your ex’s current girlfriend. Doesn’t that count?"

Evelyn’s expression remained blank for a second before realization dawned. "You mean Vanessa?"

Victoria nodded. "Unless you’ve got another ex I should know about?"

Evelyn sighed. "What exactly did you see?" She wasn’t particularly interested, but Victoria’s excitement was contagious.

"I had a stomachache, so I was in the bathroom for a while. Then, someone rushed in and started throwing up—"

"Get to the point," Evelyn cut in, exasperated. She’d never noticed how much Victoria liked to drag things out.

"I’m getting there!" Victoria tapped the table impatiently. "At first, it was just someone being sick. But then I heard a man’s voice. I was about to call security when—bam!—they started kissing right outside the stall!"

Evelyn processed the information. "So, Vanessa was the one throwing up, and the man with her was Lucien?"

Victoria’s jaw dropped. "Damn! How did you guess? I thought I was the only one who knew!" She looked genuinely shocked, her moment of triumph deflated.

Evelyn shrugged. "Lucky guess."

"Lucky guess?" Victoria scoffed. "Why didn’t you say Dominic instead?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Dominic was sitting right in front of me. And you said it was a secret affair. If it were him, it wouldn’t be much of a secret."

"Fair point," Victoria conceded, then narrowed her eyes. "But how did you know it was Lucien? Could’ve been anyone."

"First, he’s the only one Vanessa’s been cozy with. Second, they were acting weird at the event yesterday. I had a feeling something was up, but it’s not my business."

"So, I’m the only one who cares?" Victoria pouted.

Evelyn smirked as she stood. "At least you got free entertainment."

"Ugh, it was disgusting!" Victoria called after her. "Where are you going? Not back already, are you?"

Evelyn waved without turning around. "Something came up."

She had seen Alexander leaving earlier, and he’d texted her. She wanted to catch him before heading back.

"Meeting your boyfriend again?" Victoria teased.

Evelyn ignored her, already halfway out the door.
###Chapter 176

Evelyn was taken aback by how composed Vanessa appeared as she observed her retreating figure. Vanessa didn’t linger on her failed past relationship. Instead, she handled it with effortless grace and moved forward without a backward glance. Now, Vanessa was thriving in a new romance, living her best life with unapologetic confidence.

Evelyn never expected to be staying at the same luxury hotel as Vanessa and Dominic—not until their unexpected encounter at The Canopy. Then again, The Chateau Royale was the finest establishment in the city, so it made sense that most attendees of the fragrance sampling event had booked rooms there. The prices varied depending on the floor, each level offering a different tier of exclusivity.

Evelyn waited a few extra moments before stepping into the elevator that would take her to Alexander’s suite. She hadn’t paid much attention to the time, but when she reached his floor, the silence was almost eerie. It was as if the entire level had been emptied of guests. The plush carpet muffled her footsteps as she made her way down the hall, her heart beating just a little faster.

When she arrived, Alexander’s door was already open.

"Did you reserve the entire floor?" she asked, pausing at the threshold. Her gaze swept down the empty corridor, confirming her suspicion.

"Of course. Privacy is non-negotiable," Alexander replied smoothly, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. And to him, it was. "You took your time."

Before she could respond, he reached for her, pulling her into his arms. As punishment for her delay, he dipped his head and nipped lightly at her earlobe.

Evelyn shivered, squirming away with a breathless laugh. "I came as soon as I could, but there were people around. I couldn’t risk being seen."

"People?" Alexander’s expression darkened at the memory of Dominic. "I only saw one nuisance." His voice was laced with irritation. He didn’t care about Dominic—not really—but the sight of him approaching Evelyn had ignited a possessive fury in Alexander’s chest.

"I meant Victoria," Evelyn corrected, playfully swatting his hand away. She could practically feel the jealousy rolling off him, and it amused her. Mimicking his tone, she added, "After you left, Victoria showed up and—well, she handled the nuisance for me."

Alexander’s lips curved in approval. "She deserves a bonus."

Evelyn laughed, imagining Victoria’s bewildered expression if she found out she was being rewarded for shooing away an unwanted admirer.

"You’re distracted," Alexander murmured, turning her to face him fully. He didn’t like when her thoughts wandered elsewhere, especially when he wanted her undivided attention. So he claimed her lips in a deep, punishing kiss, leaving no room for further distractions.

Evelyn melted into him, her arms winding around his neck. With him, she always felt this—this overwhelming sense of rightness. When they finally broke apart, Alexander nuzzled his nose against hers, his breath warm against her skin.

"Aren’t you curious about what Dominic said to me?" Evelyn asked, expecting him to question their exchange. After all, he’d been watching them the entire time.

"Not even slightly," Alexander replied, his voice dripping with disdain. "Whatever came out of his mouth was undoubtedly worthless."

Evelyn blinked, impressed by how accurately he’d guessed. She almost wanted to applaud.

"That temporary fix he provided for your problem went straight to his head," Alexander continued, releasing her to prepare a cup of tea. Steam curled around his face as he poured the hot water, his profile striking against the mist. "He wanted to gloat. Pathetic."

Evelyn watched him, her heart skipping at the sight. Even something as simple as making tea looked regal when Alexander did it.
###Chapter 177

"How did you figure that out?" Evelyn grinned as she settled into the chair across from Alexander, propping her chin on her hands. Her eyes sparkled with amusement. "Is there anything you don't know?"

Alexander poured steaming water into the delicate teacups with practiced ease. "Plenty," he admitted, his voice low and measured. "For example—when do you plan on telling the world about us?"

The intensity in his gaze made Evelyn laugh. "Mr. Kensington, the man who thrives in the shadows. Since when do you crave the spotlight?"

"Only for certain things." He dropped a tea bag into her cup and slid it toward her. "When it comes to us? I want everyone to know."

There was a possessiveness in his tone, a quiet declaration that sent warmth curling through her chest. He wanted the world to see her as his, to know she was untouchable.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, wrapping her fingers around the cup. The heat seeped into her skin, grounding her. "Oh, right," Alexander added abruptly. "Those two have been meeting with Lucien Dubois lately. Stay away from him."

Her fingers stilled just before touching the liquid. "Why?"

Something about Lucien had always unsettled her. At first, she assumed his presence at industry events was just business—Dominic’s company had hired him, after all.

But three things stood out: his suspicious closeness to Vanessa, his unexpected attendance at the sampling session, and now Alexander’s warning.

"He’s a prodigy in the international perfume scene. Brilliant, award-winning—but with a trail of rumors." Alexander set the kettle down and took his seat, cradling his own cup. "Some say he steals formulas. Others claim his products have caused issues."

He exhaled, frowning. "He vanished for months. I didn’t expect him to resurface here, and—" A pause. "Let’s just say his personal conduct is questionable."

Evelyn arched a brow. "With women?"

Alexander’s jaw tightened. "Yes. There was an accusation—dismissed due to lack of evidence. But where there’s smoke..." His gaze locked onto hers. "Just steer clear."

"I wasn’t planning on cozying up to anyone from DR Holdings anyway," she assured him.

That seemed to satisfy him. He took a slow sip, then—without warning—asked, "About last night... Are you okay?"

Evelyn choked on her tea.

What kind of question is that?!

Her face burned as she coughed into her hand, desperate to avoid his knowing smirk. But the memories flooded back anyway—his hands, his mouth, the way he—

Alexander watched her struggle with visible delight. "That reaction suggests dissatisfaction." He sighed dramatically. "We’ll have to try again."

Evelyn gaped at him.

Unbelievable.
###Chapter 178

"How devious! How dare he play me like this?"

"Shall we try again?" Alexander Kensington arched a brow, his lips curling into a smirk as he studied Evelyn Carter.

Evelyn had had enough. After all that talk, he had circled right back to their unfinished phone conversation.

"There's no need, Mr. Kensington. I'm perfectly satisfied with your... skills and performance." She dismissed him with a graceful wave, refusing to give him the upper hand.

Her compliment didn’t please him. His faint scoff was barely audible as he set his cup down. "That's not what you said earlier."

"Really? My mind was a mess back then. I don’t even recall." She shrugged, feigning ignorance.

"So you want me to refresh your memory?" He pushed away from the counter and closed the distance between them.

Her instincts screamed at her to flee, but before she could, his fingers wrapped around her wrist, guiding her back onto the stool.

"Alex..." His name slipped from her lips in a whisper, her palms pressing lightly against his chest. The defiance from moments ago had vanished, leaving her pliant beneath his touch.

"Don’t be afraid." His voice softened, his expression turning serious. "Even though we’ve taken a step forward, I won’t force you into anything you don’t want. Understand?"

Evelyn hadn’t expected such sincerity. Moments ago, she had been teasing him, but now, under the weight of his earnest gaze, her resistance melted away.

Her fingers brushed his cheek, tender and slow. "Alex… I wanted this too."

His lips grazed the back of her hand. "I know."

He had been certain of her feelings—that was why he had pressed on. Had she hesitated, he would have stopped. But she hadn’t. And for that, he considered himself the luckiest man alive.

Evelyn wrapped her arms around his waist, burying her face in his chest. She, too, felt fortunate. What had started as a mere transaction had blossomed into something far beyond her expectations.

Meanwhile, Vanessa Blake was in a wretched state. Her face had lost all color, her lips cracked from dehydration.

Dominic Reeves hovered anxiously beside her. "Vanessa, let me take you to the hospital."

She shook her head weakly, leaning against the bedframe. "No… I just need rest."

But the moment she closed her eyes, Lucien Dubois’ face filled her mind, sending a fresh wave of terror through her. She hadn’t expected him to be so bold—following her into the restroom in a public place.

Thankfully, after a brief, heated exchange, he had left. But even that fleeting encounter had shaken her to the core.

If anyone had seen them—especially Dominic—her reputation would be ruined.

She couldn’t let this continue. It was time to act.
###Chapter 179

Dominic had strictly forbidden Vanessa from returning to the lab after their trip to Silverpine Valley. The chemicals were far too hazardous for their unborn child, he insisted.

Lately, he had been nothing short of doting—attending to her every need, ensuring she rested, and keeping her comfortable. Lucien Dubois had parted ways with them for now, but before leaving, he had handed Vanessa two perfume formulas.

"A token of my latest research," he had said with a cryptic smile. "Consider it a reward."

Though Vanessa had initially hesitated, the moment the lab produced samples from those formulas, her doubts melted away. The scents were exquisite—far beyond her expectations. For the first time in weeks, she felt a flicker of satisfaction. All her efforts hadn’t been in vain.

But two formulas weren’t enough. She wanted more.

Just the thought of Lucien sent a shiver down her spine. A temporary separation was for the best—her body needed to recover, and she needed time to strategize.

"What’s on your mind?" Dominic’s voice pulled her from her thoughts as he approached with a steaming glass of milk. His care was relentless now, suffocating in its thoroughness.

She accepted the glass with a practiced smile. "Just thinking about the annual perfumery competition. If we launch these new scents in time, even placing second would give DR Holdings a significant boost."

Dominic’s grin was smug as he pinched her nose playfully. "Great minds think alike. I’ve already started preparations. Registration closes next month, so we need to move fast. The market response should be strong—I’ve tested them myself. They’re flawless."

Vanessa exhaled in relief. "Good. Maybe this will help offset some of the company’s losses. It’ll take some weight off your shoulders too."

His expression softened. "Vanessa… you’re still worrying about the company even now?"

She rolled her eyes. "Of course I am. You’ve treated me well, haven’t you? Besides, part of DR Holdings is mine too."

Dominic chuckled, nodding eagerly. "Exactly. The company is mine, which means it’s yours. And one day, it’ll belong to our children." His voice dropped, turning contemplative. "I’m so glad I chose you. If I had picked Evelyn instead—"

The name alone made Vanessa stiffen. "Don’t mention her. It makes me sick."

Dominic’s jaw tightened at the memory of Evelyn’s betrayal. Years together, and he’d never seen the depths of her ruthlessness. Tampering with formulas, turning vindictive when he tried to reconcile—did she really think the company would collapse without her?

Soon, she’d regret everything.

"Right, forget her," he muttered, shaking off the thought. "Drink your milk. I’ve got good news."

Vanessa downed the warm liquid, the tension in her shoulders easing slightly. Dominic adjusted her pillows, tucking her in with meticulous care. "Remember when we talked about marriage?"

She blinked. "Of course."

"Well… I spoke to my mother. She wants to meet you."

Vanessa’s breath hitched. "Genevieve Sinclair?"

Dominic nodded, his smile widening. "Once that’s done, we can start planning the wedding. Unless you want to walk down the aisle with a massive belly?"

Her fingers tightened around the empty glass.

A meeting with Genevieve.

This changed everything.
###Chapter 180

"...Yeah." Vanessa answered hesitantly. Her expression showed no trace of joy at Dominic's news.

Though she wasn't considering ending their relationship, marriage was the last thing on her mind.

Becoming a full-time homemaker after childbirth—tending to domestic duties and raising their child—wasn't part of her vision.

Dominic's current standing and DR Holdings' modest success fell far short of her ambitions. A baby now would derail her plans to climb the industry ladder. How could she amass real wealth?

"Aren't you happy about this?" Dominic had expected Vanessa to leap into his arms, showering him with kisses. Instead, her reaction was disturbingly subdued.

"It's not that. Have you told your mother I'm pregnant?" she deflected.

"No, I wanted it to be a surprise. Why?"

Relief flickered across her face. "Nothing. I just think we should wait before telling her. Early pregnancies can be... delicate. If something went wrong, it would devastate us both."

"Enough!" His face darkened instantly. "Our child will be perfectly healthy. Don't even entertain such thoughts! Your only focus should be taking care of yourself and our baby. Everything else can wait."

"Mom's never said it outright, but I know she wants grandchildren. Remember, she only had a daughter after remarrying. As her only son, this news would mean everything to her."

"You're overthinking this. I'm just being realistic—"

"Stop." His grip tightened on her shoulders. "Vanessa, no more of this nonsense. No negative thoughts, no outside influences. You and our child will be fine. That's non-negotiable. Understood?"

Vanessa fell silent. Slowly, she nodded, her expression growing heavier.

Truthfully, she'd contemplated termination but remained undecided. Testing Dominic's reaction had backfired spectacularly. His intensity made her dread his response if she went through with it.

Yet the pregnancy defied odds—after everything, the stubborn life persisted.

Her initial hesitation about abortion deepened after this conversation. For now... she'd let fate decide.

After settling Vanessa in bed, Dominic slipped out and dialed a familiar number.

"Mom."

A refined voice answered. "Dominic."

"I'm bringing Vanessa to The Canopy tomorrow. I'll arrive early—take your time."

"I've told you I have no interest in meeting her." After a pause, Genevieve added, "You could do better."

Dominic glanced at the closed bedroom door, lowering his voice. "You promised me one meeting. Just give her a chance. You'll see what I see."
###Chapter 181

The past few days had been a whirlwind for Evelyn Carter. The crimson mahogany plant she'd been eagerly awaiting had finally arrived. It wasn't large—just a medium-sized specimen, specially cultivated by the nursery—but it was exactly what she needed.

After returning from Silverpine Valley, Vanessa Blake had gone above and beyond, securing Evelyn her own private lab at Phoenix Labs. Though not expansive, it was fully equipped with everything she required.

The sudden shift in Vanessa’s attitude toward Evelyn sent shockwaves through the company. Whispers spread like wildfire.

It wasn’t fair, they murmured. No one else had been granted a private workspace after less than three months. And Evelyn hadn’t even gone through the standard hiring process—she’d appeared out of nowhere, already wrapped in rumors.

Vanessa didn’t bother justifying her decision. Instead, she left them with a challenge.

"I tested Evelyn. Anyone willing to take the same test—and pass—will get the same privileges. Fair enough?"

That shut them up.

Most had witnessed the first task. There was no cheating, no shortcuts. While others had been stumped, Evelyn had pinpointed the issue effortlessly.

The second task? Just hearing about it gave them headaches. No one dared attempt it.

So they swallowed their complaints and went back to work.

Inside the lab, Evelyn was in her element. The outside world didn’t exist.

Her time in Silverpine Valley had sparked an idea, but it wasn’t until she found the crimson mahogany that everything clicked.

She worked tirelessly—washing, drying, cutting, melting, extracting. By nightfall, her neck ached, forcing her to pause.

Moments like these made her miss Bella more than ever.

They had been the perfect team. Bella handled the prep work while Evelyn crafted the fragrances. They moved in sync, anticipating each other’s needs.

But Dominic still refused to accept Bella’s resignation.

Evelyn checked the date on her phone, then dialed.

"Bella, free for dinner?"

Thirty minutes later, they sat at a small food stand near Bella’s apartment. The table was piled with burgers, fries, tacos—but silence hung heavy between them.

Finally, Bella grabbed a burger and took an aggressive bite, as if chewing through frustration. Evelyn followed suit, eating slowly.

They used to do this all the time. Back then, Bella had been by her side more than Dominic ever was.

When only wrappers remained, Evelyn wiped her hands and pulled a contract from her bag. She slid it across the table.

"Take it home. Read it. We’ll discuss any changes. Welcome to the team."

Bella glanced at the document—an employment contract from Phoenix Labs. But she didn’t pick it up.

"What’s wrong?" Evelyn frowned. "You haven’t resigned yet?"

Bella shook her head.

"Don’t you want to be my partner again?"
###Chapter 182

"That's—That's not it. Working with you in this industry has been one of the greatest joys of my life! I've learned so much from you, and experimenting with fragrances is something I truly love."

"Then..." Evelyn Carter paused, considering her words carefully. "If I'm not mistaken, the company should automatically terminate your employment thirty days after you submit your resignation, regardless of Dominic Reeves' approval. The deadline is approaching."

Legally, Dominic couldn't force Sophia Grant to stay, no matter how much he wanted to.

"Yeah, it's almost time." Sophia sighed, her fingers tapping restlessly against the armrest. "The problem is... my mother won't let me resign."

Evelyn hadn’t expected Sophia’s mother to be involved. "Why wouldn’t Mrs. Grant—?"

"Dominic came to my house recently. He met my mom. She trusts him completely—thinks he’s an amazing boss and that I’m being ungrateful for the opportunities he’s given me. And then he gave me a raise, which only made her more insistent that I stay at DR Holdings."

Sophia leaned back in her seat, tilting her head up to the sky. The night was thick with clouds, not a single star in sight. "I’ve thought about it. Maybe I’ll just stay. It’s not like I’m actually working hard anyway. If he’s willing to pay me for doing nothing, isn’t that a win for me?"

"Sophia, you can’t think like that." Evelyn’s voice was firm. "Stagnating like that will only hurt your career in the long run."

To outsiders, it might seem like Sophia was lucky—getting paid without effort. But time wasted was time lost. All the experience she had built would mean nothing if she let herself rot in a position with no growth.

That was why Evelyn had been trying to bring Sophia to Phoenix Labs. She considered Sophia a true friend and wanted the best for her.

"My mom won’t let me leave..." Sophia trailed off helplessly.

Evelyn arched a brow. "You don’t strike me as the type to blindly follow your parents’ wishes without knowing what you want."

The situation was simple. Sophia’s mother likely opposed her resignation because DR Holdings seemed like a stable company with good benefits and a reliable boss.

But if Sophia joined Phoenix Labs, her career could skyrocket. With proper communication, Evelyn was sure Mrs. Grant would understand.

Sophia stared at Evelyn for a long moment before suddenly bursting into laughter. "I was joking! I don’t actually want to leave."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "Why not?"

Sophia had always insisted she’d follow Evelyn anywhere. They were a team. It had only been a few weeks—Evelyn refused to believe Sophia had changed her mind. And it certainly wasn’t because of Dominic’s raise.

"Because I think I can help you more by staying here than by being at your side," Sophia explained.

Evelyn frowned. "What do you mean?"

"Vanessa Blake has been unstoppable since she and Dominic returned from Silverpine Valley. She finalized two perfume formulas effortlessly, and the labs are working overtime to produce them. Dominic is convinced they’ll be a massive success." Sophia straightened, her expression serious.

"And how does that help me?"

"I want to find out just how good these perfumes are—and what else they’re planning. If they’re scheming something against you again, I’ll be in the perfect position to warn you in time."

Sophia had spent days thinking this through. Staying at DR Holdings wasn’t about comfort or money. It was about being Evelyn’s eyes and ears where she needed them most.

Instead of standing beside her, Sophia would stand guard.
###Chapter 183

Evelyn's fury caught Sophia completely off guard.

"I don't need that!" Evelyn snapped, her voice sharp, her expression unyielding.

"Evelyn, I—" Sophia hadn't anticipated this reaction. It left her momentarily speechless. "D-Did I do something wrong?"

"Of course you did!" Evelyn repeated firmly. "What do you think of yourself? What do you think of me? I know DR Holdings is developing new products because they've been recycling the same old formulas for too long. Without innovation, they won't survive."

"But I don’t care about their new formulas or their secrets, Liv—Sophia." Evelyn corrected herself, frustration lacing her words. "You've been in this industry long enough to know the line between right and wrong. Do you really think I need you to spy for me? Do you believe I can't compete fairly?"

She exhaled sharply before continuing, softer this time. "Sophia, I don’t need you watching my back like that. Come work with me. Be my assistant. That’s where you belong."

Sophia fell silent, chastened. After a long pause, she murmured, "I'm sorry."

I was wrong. The realization hit her hard. I thought this was the best way to help Evelyn get revenge. But if I did this, I’d be no better than Dominic and Vanessa.

Dominic and Vanessa had stolen Evelyn’s work. Now, Sophia had nearly crossed the same line by trying to uncover their secrets.

"Sophia, I know you meant well," Evelyn said, her tone gentler now. She nudged the contract toward her again. "But if you really want to help me, come join Phoenix Labs. I’ve been working on something new, and I could use your expertise. It’s time you left DR Holdings behind."

This time, Sophia took the contract. Scanning it, she teased, "The salary isn’t any better than what I’m getting now."

Evelyn laughed. "Prove yourself at Phoenix Labs, and the bonuses will make up for it."

"Fine," Sophia sighed dramatically, though inside, she was elated.

This was worth celebrating. No more suffocating corporate politics—just her and Evelyn, doing what they loved.

By the time Evelyn got home, it was nearly midnight. Work had consumed her lately, keeping her out late most nights. Alexander had been just as busy, buried in his own projects. Days had passed since they’d last seen each other.

Standing in their empty bedroom, a pang of longing hit her. She missed him.

Back when she was with Dominic, she’d worked late often too. She’d come home alone, slept alone, handled everything alone. Dominic had occasionally joined her for dinner, but he never stayed.

Yet she’d never felt this ache of loneliness with him. Now, she was used to Alexander’s presence—his warmth, his devotion. She hated admitting it, but she’d grown dependent on him.

After a quick shower, she climbed into bed. Hesitating only a moment, she sent him a text: "Coming home tonight?"

Exhaustion overtook her before he could reply. She didn’t stir when he finally slipped in beside her, nor when his arms wrapped around her, pulling her close.

Half-asleep, she turned toward him, murmuring something incoherent. Then, instinctively, she draped herself over him, clinging like a koala.

Alexander sighed, amused and utterly helpless.
###Chapter 184

Alexander Kensington had raced back to Crestview Heights in the dead of night after receiving Evelyn Carter's message. Yet when he arrived, his wife barely glanced at him before burrowing into his chest. The conflicting emotions swirling within him left him torn between delight and frustration.

Delight because she sought comfort in his arms. Frustration because she did so without hesitation. What if it hadn't been him lying there?

"Evelyn. Evelyn..." He whispered her name against her ear, his breath warm against her skin.

"Quiet! You're so loud!" She swatted at the air, her face scrunched in annoyance.

Alexander exhaled sharply. 'She complains about the noise yet clings to me tighter, pressing her face deeper into my shoulder as if that would block out sound.'

He considered voicing his thoughts but ultimately swallowed them. 'She's my queen. This conversation can wait until morning.'

Soon, his muscles relaxed beneath her weight, and he drifted off with Evelyn using him as her personal body pillow.

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Evelyn stirred. Refreshed from deep sleep, she attempted to stretch but found herself pinned. Blinking awake, she met the smoldering gaze of her husband.

"Alex?" Her voice held genuine surprise. "When did you get back?"

Alexander's dark eyes locked onto hers, finally allowing him to voice last night's concerns. "You cuddled up to me without even verifying my identity. What kind of self-preservation instincts are those?" His reprimand came with a gentle tap to her forehead - just enough to make his point without causing pain.

Evelyn rubbed the spot with a pout. "Who else would be in our bed besides you?"

"A burglar, perhaps?"

She scoffed, rolling her eyes. "The security at Crestview Heights isn't just for show. And even if someone breached the gates, this house has a Veridian-grade protection system installed." Her tone dripped with amusement at what she deemed a ridiculous hypothetical.

His eyebrows shot up. "How did you know about the security system?"

Evelyn nearly facepalmed. After months living here, she'd recognized the subtle signs - while not as sophisticated as the Hawthorne estate's defenses, the Kensington home's security far exceeded standard residential protections.

"I guessed!" She recovered quickly, flashing an impish smile. "Haven't you seen those billionaire dramas? People of your status always have fortress-level security. It's practically a trope." She punctuated her explanation with a self-satisfied eyebrow wiggle.

"Should I take this to mean you feel safest with me?" Noticing her attempt to rise, Alexander caught her wrist and reeled her back against his chest.

"Alex, stop playing around. Phoenix Labs needs me today." She squirmed in his grasp, her mind already racing with research parameters. Until those formulas stabilized, she wouldn't rest easy.

"You've been married to that lab more than to me lately." His murmur vibrated against her neck as he nuzzled the sensitive skin there. "Maybe I should revoke your lab access privileges."

Evelyn's eyes widened in mock horror. 'Note to self: never let personal disputes bleed into professional consequences with this man.'
###Chapter 185

Vanessa was on edge. They had been waiting for what felt like hours, but Genevieve still hadn’t arrived.

“It’s fine,” Dominic murmured, trying to soothe her. “She must be delayed by something important.”

But even as he said it, doubt flickered in his eyes. He knew his mother had no desire to meet Vanessa. This entire arrangement had been his insistence, not hers.

Just as he reached for his phone to call her, the door swung open. Genevieve’s personal assistant stepped aside, allowing her to enter before discreetly closing the door behind her, standing guard outside.

Genevieve Sinclair was immaculate in a slate-gray Chanel ensemble, her freshly styled waves cascading over her shoulders. Vanessa’s gaze immediately caught the glint of her earrings and bracelet—both from this season’s most exclusive jewelry line. A pang of envy twisted in her chest.

Despite her age, Genevieve could have passed for thirty-five. Decades of meticulous skincare, disciplined fitness, and effortless elegance had preserved her like a timeless portrait. Vanessa couldn’t help but resent it.

If only Dominic were Genevieve’s legitimate heir—born within the sanctity of her current marriage—Vanessa wouldn’t be scrambling for alternatives. But no, he was the inconvenient reminder of a past union, a son she could never publicly claim. And that meant Vanessa had to hedge her bets elsewhere.

“Mom,” Dominic greeted, stepping forward to kiss her cheek before gesturing to Vanessa. “This is Vanessa. I’ve mentioned her before.” His arm slid possessively around Vanessa’s waist.

Genevieve’s eyes flicked over Vanessa with the barest acknowledgment before she removed her gloves and settled at the table. She picked up her utensils with practiced grace, sampling the dishes with quiet approval. This restaurant was her favorite—pristine service, impeccable flavors, and absolute discretion.

For years, their meetings had been just the two of them. Today was different.

“How have you been, Mom?” Dominic asked, taking his seat. His tone was careful, measured. “I heard about the latest acquisition. With Julian’s health declining, it must be exhausting.”

Genevieve dabbed her lips with a napkin before setting it aside. “You needn’t concern yourself with that.”

Dominic nodded stiffly. “Of course. I know you can handle anything. I just wanted to thank you for stepping in with DR Holdings. Without your guidance, I wouldn’t have resolved the issue.”

Vanessa’s fingers tightened around her glass. The formality between them was jarring. This wasn’t a mother and son—it was a business transaction.

Genevieve set down her fork with deliberate precision. “Dominic, you mishandled this situation.”

“I admit, I was careless,” he conceded quickly. “Evelyn exploited that oversight, and it nearly cost us—”

“No,” Genevieve interrupted, her voice cool. “I’m not referring to the paperwork. I’m talking about your personal affairs. You’ve mismanaged them entirely.”
###Chapter 186

"Mom?" Dominic asked Genevieve in confusion. He was stunned, not expecting her to say that.

"Why would Evelyn tamper with the form? How many years have you been together? You know very well that most of DR Holdings' signature products were created by her. She was always devoted to you. So why force her out?" Genevieve's knuckles rapped sharply against the table, her expression stern—like a headmistress reprimanding a wayward student.

Dominic stiffened, discomfort prickling his skin. "Mom..."

"I asked Lucien to help you because you're my son. I don’t want to see your efforts crumble after all these years. But that doesn’t mean you’re blameless. Dominic, you made a grave mistake!"

Her words were merciless, and the most uncomfortable person in the room was Vanessa.

What is happening? I came here to meet my future mother-in-law, but she hasn’t even glanced at me properly. Instead, she’s praising his ex right in front of me?

Vanessa shifted in her seat, anxiety coiling in her stomach.

Dominic refused to back down. "Mom, I can’t control my heart. Vanessa is the woman I love. I can’t spend my life with Evelyn just because she’s talented!"

He exhaled sharply. "Yes, Evelyn was brilliant, but you can’t expect me to marry her out of obligation. I admit I used her skills, but I compensated her well. And after all those years together, she walked away without hesitation. That proves how cold she is."

His voice lowered. "Someone like her would’ve betrayed me eventually. I just removed a liability before it hurt the company."

Genevieve’s gaze hardened. "Should I applaud you for that?"

"That’s not what I meant. Mom, today is about Vanessa. The past is over. Evelyn is gone. I love Vanessa, and she’s going to be your daughter-in-law. I’m marrying her."

Genevieve studied Vanessa for a long moment—and Vanessa knew instantly she wasn’t welcome.

"You’re an adult. I can’t stop you from making your own choices." Genevieve retrieved her bag. "But marriage isn’t a game. If you’re determined, then proceed."

She slid a debit card across the table. "A wedding gift. You know I won’t attend. The PIN is your birthday. Whatever happens, I want you to live well."

"Thanks, Mom!" Dominic accepted it eagerly. "Your blessing means everything."

Genevieve stood. "I’ve taken enough of your time. I’ll leave now."

Dominic rose, nudging Vanessa, who reluctantly stood as well.

Genevieve ignored her, resting a hand on Dominic’s shoulder. "Take care."

Then she walked away without another word.
###Chapter 187

Dominic's face lit up with pure joy. He clutched the platinum credit card in one hand and Vanessa's delicate fingers in the other. "Vanessa, darling, we can finally have our dream wedding!"

Vanessa glanced at the gleaming card before coldly withdrawing her hand. "Is that so?"

The card's holographic security strip caught the light as Dominic continued eagerly. "This isn't just any card - it's Mother's blessing. She's accepted you as part of the Reeves family now." His voice softened. "I know her words earlier stung, but you must understand - she only wants what's best for me."

Vanessa's crimson nails tapped against her designer purse. "Oh, she certainly knows what's best for you. She's already picked out Evelyn Carter as your perfect bride." The memory of Genevieve Sinclair's condescending smile made Vanessa's blood boil.

'That woman kept praising Evelyn while I sat right there! As if some perfume-making nobody could compare to me!'

Dominic sighed, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. "You're still upset. Mother's opinions mean nothing - it's my heart that matters. And my heart has only ever belonged to you." He pressed the card into her palm. "From today, you'll control all our finances. Even I'll be under your command. Doesn't that prove my devotion?"

Vanessa examined the card's embossed lettering before meeting Dominic's earnest gaze. A slow smile curved her lips. "We'll see about that."

After dropping Vanessa at her penthouse, Dominic sped toward Phoenix Labs. Their new fragrance line was in its final development phase - too crucial for mistakes. As Vanessa often reminded him, these two perfumes would determine whether DR Holdings regained its former glory.

The lab hummed with activity. Recently hired perfumers - competent though not exceptional - worked diligently at their stations. Dominic surveyed their progress with satisfaction before noticing an empty workstation.

"Where's Isabella?" he snapped at the lab supervisor. "Playing hooky again?" His jaw tightened. 'That insolent girl can't even pretend to be professional for a full week.'

The supervisor paled. "Mr. Reeves, she... she resigned three days ago."

"Resigned?" Dominic's shout echoed through the lab. "Without my approval? Get her on the phone now!"

His assistant scrambled to comply, then looked up nervously. "The number's... disconnected, sir."

Dominic's fist slammed onto a stainless steel counter, sending glass vials rattling. "Find her! I won't tolerate this insubordination!"
###Chapter 188

"Try harder! If you still can't reach her, go to her apartment and drag her here! How dare she skip work?" Dominic roared, but the words didn't fully capture his fury. After a brief pause, he snapped, "Forget it. I'll handle this myself!"

He stormed back to DR Holdings, heading straight for HR the moment he arrived. "Pull up Sophia Grant's file. She abandoned her position without approval from upper management. Have Legal draft the necessary penalties and compensation."

One of the HR executives hesitated before speaking. "Mr. Reeves, Sophia submitted her resignation over a month ago. According to labor regulations, she's free to leave after thirty days—approval or not."

"What kind of ridiculous law is that?" Dominic's jaw tightened. He had assumed she couldn’t leave unless he signed off on it. The realization that she had slipped through his fingers ignited fresh rage.

"That’s the law, sir," the executive murmured, shrinking under his glare.

Dominic clenched his fists. "So she just walks away? There’s nothing we can do?"

"She hasn’t collected last month’s salary or bonus," the executive offered, flipping through the documents.

"Withhold it," Dominic ordered without hesitation.

"Given her previous role’s sensitivity, we could enforce a non-compete clause."

Dominic’s eyes gleamed. "Perfect. Draft it immediately. Block her from working anywhere in this industry. If she violates it, sue her for damages."

He knew exactly why Sophia had left—she was joining Evelyn’s team. Well, he wouldn’t make it easy for her. If she wanted to walk away, fine. But she wouldn’t set foot in another company in this field for a year.

And if she dared? He’d drag her to court. Let Evelyn cover the fines. The thought soothed his temper slightly.

It was dangerous to tease a man who had just indulged in forbidden pleasures. Evelyn showered quickly, choosing a high-necked blouse and wrapping a silk scarf around her throat—just enough to hide the evidence of last night’s passion.

She rushed to Phoenix Labs, where she’d asked Sophia to meet her for orientation. But when she arrived, breathless, Sophia was already there, chatting animatedly with Victoria.

Evelyn wasn’t sure how long they’d been talking, but their easy rapport made it seem like they’d known each other for years.

Victoria turned at the sound of footsteps, smirking. "Well, well. The infamous workaholic is late today."
###Chapter 189

"Sorry, I overslept." Evelyn glanced at Isabella with an apologetic smile. "Though I suppose introductions aren't necessary between you two."

"Starting today, we're a team! No need for formalities," Victoria chimed in, draping an arm around Isabella's shoulders with effortless warmth.

"Vicky, you're playing favorites!" Evelyn rolled her eyes dramatically. "You weren't nearly this welcoming when I first joined."

"That's because I thought you got in through connections," Victoria teased, giving Isabella's shoulder a playful squeeze. "But I approved of Bella the moment I saw her work."

"Double standards much?" Evelyn laughed before clapping her hands together. "Alright, now that you're here, let's get started. Perfect timing too—I'm itching to finalize the new product's formula."

"Go ahead and dive in. You can handle the onboarding paperwork later this week, right? Just swing by HR when you're ready," Victoria said, her gaze lingering on Isabella for confirmation.

"No problem at all," Isabella replied smoothly. Paperwork was the least of her concerns—what truly mattered was the team dynamic and work environment. As she stepped into the lab, her eyes widened appreciatively. "This setup is impressive! You've got even more equipment here than at our old lab. Wait—is that the new chromatograph?"

Evelyn was already slipping into her lab coat. "Phoenix Labs might be smaller, but with Celestia Group backing us, we don't skimp on resources. Ms. Sterling said we can request anything else we need too."

"Big corporate perks—told you jumping ship was the right move." Isabella tied back her hair, scrubbing her hands at the sink. "Speaking of which... Dominic didn't give you trouble when you resigned, did he?" Though Isabella seemed relaxed, Evelyn couldn't shake her concern.

"Didn't even see him." Isabella waved a dismissive hand. "Labor laws are on my side. Besides..." She leaned in conspiratorially, "I've already moved to a new place near the lab. Two birds, one stone."

"You relocated already?" Evelyn's brows shot up.

"Mm-hmm." Isabella nodded. "Mom's too soft-hearted—if Dominic kept showing up, she might've caved. This way, I'm closer to work and out of his reach." She flashed a triumphant grin. "Had my eye on a place in Magnolia Grove for weeks. Called the agent the second I accepted this position."

"That's... remarkably efficient." Evelyn shook her head in admiration before turning to their workstations. For the next hours, they fell into their familiar rhythm—Evelyn outlining formulations while Isabella prepped ingredients with precision. Their partnership had always been seamless, with Isabella's meticulous note-taking complementing Evelyn's creative process.

Perfumery was a dance of trial and error. Countless samples would be crafted, each variable meticulously recorded. A single alteration could transform an entire composition.

Night had draped the sky in indigo by the time Evelyn emerged from the lab, rolling her stiff shoulders. Isabella appeared moments later with two steaming mugs. "Perfect timing. Coffee break?"

Gratefully accepting a mug, Evelyn sank onto the lounge sofa.

"Long day?" Isabella's voice softened as she noticed Evelyn's tension. Before Evelyn could respond, Isabella set down her coffee. "Turn around. You need this." Her hands settled on Evelyn's shoulders, kneading the knots with practiced ease.

Evelyn sighed as the tension began to melt. "Remind me why we ever worked anywhere else?"

Isabella's laughter was warm against the hum of the lab equipment. "Because we hadn't found our way here yet."

The words hung between them, brimming with unspoken promise—of new beginnings, of creations yet to be born. Outside the lab windows, the city lights glittered like scattered constellations, mirroring the sparks of possibility igniting between them.
###Chapter 190

The moment Sophia placed her hands on Evelyn’s shoulders, memories flooded back. Back at DR Holdings, she used to do this for Evelyn all the time. It had been ages since the last time.

Evelyn didn’t refuse. She turned slightly, sweeping her dark hair over one shoulder, exposing the delicate curve of her neck. Sophia’s fingers pressed into the tense muscles, working with just the right amount of pressure to ease the stiffness.

“God, I missed this,” Evelyn sighed, tilting her head back as her eyelids fluttered shut. “The past two days have been chaos. Having you here makes everything feel lighter.”

Sophia chuckled. “If that’s the case, maybe you should consider giving me a raise.”

Evelyn scoffed, shaking her head. “Who demands a salary increase on their first day? You’ll scare your new boss before she even gets used to you.”

“A good employee knows her worth,” Sophia teased, but her laughter died abruptly when her gaze snagged on something. Her hands stilled.

Evelyn frowned, sensing the shift. “What’s wrong?”

“Evelyn, you…” Sophia hesitated, her eyes locked onto a particular spot just below Evelyn’s ear.

Confused, Evelyn glanced down but saw nothing unusual. Then Sophia reached out, her fingertip lightly brushing the sensitive skin.

Realization hit Evelyn like a bucket of ice water.

She had changed into her work blouse—one with a lower neckline—and in her distraction, she’d completely forgotten about the mark Alexander had left last night.

Heat rushed to her cheeks.

Sophia’s lips curved into a knowing smirk. “Well, well. Someone’s been busy.”

Evelyn exhaled, deciding there was no point hiding it. “Yeah. That… happened.”

Sophia burst into laughter. “Oh, I definitely get it. But the real question is—who?”

Dominic was long out of the picture, and Evelyn hadn’t been linked to anyone else. Sophia had known Evelyn’s routine for years—work, home, repeat. Rarely did she even go out.

Who the hell could it be?

“Do I know him?” Sophia pressed, curiosity burning in her eyes.

Evelyn hesitated. “Technically… yes.”

Alexander Kensington wasn’t exactly an obscure figure. In Veridian City, his name carried weight. But whether Sophia truly knew him—that was another question entirely.
###Chapter 191

"What are you talking about? Who is he? Tell me his name—maybe I know him."

"You'll find out soon enough!" Evelyn Carter raised her hand and gave Sophia Grant's shoulder a playful pat.

Evelyn stood abruptly, shifting the subject. "Bella, this new formula is going to be tricky. The workload is about to triple."

"You make it sound like our past projects were a walk in the park." Sophia grinned. "Don’t stress. Just focus on the creative direction—I’ll handle the groundwork."

Evelyn’s lips curved. "That’s why you’re the best assistant I could ever ask for."

Back in the lab, Evelyn inspected the latest batch of extracted samples. Just as she’d feared—they were nowhere near the desired profile.

High-grade ingredients were non-negotiable, but the real challenge lay in the extraction and refinement process. The scent they were chasing required layers of meticulous purification, repeated trials, and relentless precision.

Launching a new fragrance wasn’t just about inspiration—it was grueling labor. And those who stole others’ formulas? Despicable.

"Another failure." Sophia sighed, frustration flickering in her eyes.

Evelyn smirked. "Since when did we ever succeed on the first try? This ingredient is volatile—it’s going to fight us every step of the way." She nudged Sophia. "What, are you giving up already?"

Sophia rolled her eyes. "Please. If it were easy, I’d be bored. Bring on the challenge."

As Sophia prepped for another round, Evelyn stopped her. "Let’s call it a night. We’re not on a deadline."

Alexander Kensington had texted earlier, insisting she come home before dark. His protectiveness should’ve been suffocating—but secretly, she loved it.

"Fine," Sophia relented. "But I’m brainstorming improvements in my sleep."

They changed and headed for the exit—just as Victoria Sterling burst in, her expression grim.

"Victoria?" Evelyn frowned.

Victoria barely glanced at her before locking eyes with Sophia. "You can’t work here anymore."

Silence.

"What?" Sophia’s voice was sharp.

"DR Holdings sent a cease-and-desist. They claim you signed a non-compete clause—barring you from the industry for a year post-resignation."

Victoria thrust the document at them. Sophia’s face paled.

"I—I never signed this!"

"Of course you didn’t." Evelyn scanned the paper, jaw tightening. "Dominic Reeves is retaliating."

Non-competes weren’t unheard of—but they were reserved for executives with access to proprietary formulas. Sophia had been a junior researcher.

This was sabotage. Pure and simple.
###Chapter 192

Dominic Reeves despised Evelyn Carter but had no control over her. So, he redirected his focus to Sophia Grant, knowing it would indirectly impact Evelyn.

"What am I going to do?" Sophia's mood darkened as she clutched the legal notice. "I can't work here anymore?"

Victoria Sterling nodded, her expression grim. Recruiting new talent for Phoenix Labs was easy, but navigating legal battles alone was another matter entirely.

"Don't panic yet. I'll handle this," Evelyn reassured Sophia.

Every problem had a solution. The shock of the situation had only clouded their judgment.

Evelyn thought to herself, Dominic moves fast. Today was Sophia's first day, and he'd already sent the cease-and-desist. He must have been watching us. So much for his promise to leave me alone.

"Look at what he's done now. How can we go our separate ways if he keeps provoking me? I was willing to let things slide, but he's practically begging for consequences. Fine—I won't hold back."

Then, turning to Sophia, she said, "Take some time off for now. You just moved, right? Settle in and wait for my update."

"Evelyn..." Sophia hesitated, worried her situation would drag Phoenix Labs into trouble. She could handle it alone, but she didn’t want the company to suffer because of her.

Evelyn squeezed her shoulder. "Relax. This is just his pathetic attempt to intimidate you—and flex what little power he thinks he has over me. This mess is because of me, not you. Go home and wait for good news."

Victoria added, "She's right. This sounds serious, but a non-compete clause isn’t the end of the world. We’ll pause your onboarding, and once we resolve this, I’ll personally fast-track your paperwork again."

Their words left Sophia speechless. She bowed her head gratefully. "Thank you, Victoria. Thank you, Evelyn. I’m so lucky to have met you both. I won’t let you down."

Evelyn chuckled, pulling her upright. "What are you talking about? Working hard is your job, and protecting our team is ours. Now go—it’s late. Your mom will worry."

Sophia nodded and left.

Once she was gone, Evelyn stared at the document in her hand, a frosty smile curling her lips.

"Evelyn, do you have a plan?" Victoria asked, noting her calm demeanor.

Evelyn flicked the paper with her fingers. "Legally, there are only two ways to resolve this."

###Chapter 193

"First, Sophia complies with the contract and doesn’t work in perfumery for a year. Second, we break the agreement—but DR Holdings gets compensation."

"So you're choosing one of those?"

Victoria knew Evelyn wouldn’t pick the first option. What would Sophia do for a whole year? Even if we kept her on payroll, no competitor would hire her. Would she switch careers and come back later?

The second option seemed simplest—just pay the penalty. But the sum would be substantial. Sophia couldn’t afford it alone, and Phoenix Labs wouldn’t cover it for a junior hire.

After a pause, Victoria said, "Calculate the compensation amount. If you’re short, I can help."

Evelyn smirked. "Thanks, Vic, but we won’t need it. I’m not choosing the first or second option."

She leaned in, eyes glinting.

"I’m choosing the third."
###Chapter 193

Life wasn't about following rigid rules. Sometimes, you had to bend them to survive.

'I've been playing defense for too long. It's time to fight back and show Dominic and Vanessa they've messed with the wrong woman.'

When Alexander stepped into their penthouse, the sight of Evelyn sprawled across their Italian leather couch caught him off guard. Her fingers danced across the keyboard with practiced ease, legs kicking absently in the air as she focused on the screen. She rarely worked in such a casual position.

Alexander loosened his tie and slipped into his velvet house shoes before peering over her shoulder. Multiple browser tabs flashed - she was creating a fake account on some obscure forum.

"Trouble in paradise?" He poured two glasses of Cabernet, handing one to his wife.

Evelyn shifted to sit cross-legged, balancing the laptop precariously on her knees. She took the wine without looking up. "Someone wants to play dirty. I'm just returning the favor." Her clipped tone told Alexander everything.

"Who dared upset my beautiful wife?" He undid his cufflinks, rolling up his sleeves. This penthouse used to feel like a glorified hotel suite. Now, coming home to Evelyn's presence made all the difference. Her confidence told him she had things under control.

"Who else? That snake Dominic." Evelyn finally looked up, eyes flashing with determination before returning to her typing.

Alexander's brow arched as he settled beside her. The screen displayed confidential perfume formulas from DR Holdings. "Aren't those your creations from DR?"

"Bingo." Her fingers flew across the keyboard. "Dominic started this war. I tried taking the high road, but they left me no choice." With a final keystroke, she leaned back in satisfaction.

"And if he sues?" Alexander always thought three moves ahead.

Evelyn smirked. "He's tried that before. These formulas are mine. Some 'hacker' leaked them from my old email. DR publicly credited me for creating them, remember?"

She took a sip of wine. "To the public, I was just an admin assistant. How would I access trade secrets? Besides..." She winked. "I leaked multiple formulas."

Alexander considered this. "What if they claim you stole them while employed?"

"Proof?" Evelyn's laugh was sharp as broken crystal. "I never signed an NDA. Let him try his contract threats. I'm not their employee anymore."

She stretched like a satisfied cat. "If their security's so weak that a former admin can access formulas, they deserve the scandal."

Alexander nodded. Evelyn was right - in court, evidence was everything. Dominic wouldn't have dropped his last lawsuit if he'd had a solid case. The game was on.
###Chapter 194

Evelyn confessed that she had altered the forms before leaving DR Holdings, intending to create chaos for them.

But she wasn’t entirely sure how much damage it would actually cause.

"You sound so confident about this. Then I suppose there’s nothing for me to worry about," Alexander murmured, his gaze softening with adoration as his fingers gently combed through her hair.

Evelyn turned to face him, pulling his arm around her shoulders before settling onto his lap. "That’s not the point," she said in a playful, teasing tone. "You have to be ready to back me up at any moment. What if they come after me? You’d better have a team of lawyers ready to defend me in court!"

She really knows how to get to me. Every little thing she does, every glance she gives—it all hits me right in the heart. Looking at her like this makes me want to give her everything.

"Does this mean I have to do whatever you ask?" he teased.

"Aren’t you willing to?" Evelyn pouted, feigning hurt, though the mischievous glint in her eyes gave her away.

"At your service, my lady," Alexander smirked before leaning down to capture her lips.

The worst part about kissing in this position was the strain on his neck—his, specifically. Eventually, the discomfort became too much, and he straightened with a groan, rubbing the sore spot.

Evelyn bit back a laugh.

"Are you laughing at me?" he grumbled.

"I wouldn’t dare!"

Before she could say more, a soft chime from her laptop interrupted them—a notification. She quickly pulled away and checked the screen.

Most were replies to her earlier post, but a few were private messages. Since her post was related to the perfume industry, some users had already pieced together that the forms she shared were significant.

A few might have been perfumers or researchers from rival companies, but so far, no one had recognized them as DR Holdings’ confidential documents.

However, an employee from DR Holdings would know immediately.

One message stood out—a demand for her identity and motives, followed by an order to take the post down immediately.

Meanwhile, the comment section buzzed with activity. It was evening, and people were home with nothing better to do. Her post had sparked excitement, drawing a lively crowd of speculators.

Some had already begun experimenting with the formulas she’d leaked.

At this point, deleting the post was pointless. The damage was done. Screenshots had likely been taken.

Alexander reached over, closing the tab and shutting down the laptop before Evelyn could react.

"You’ve done what you needed to. No point dwelling on it now. The bait’s been thrown—the fish will bite soon enough."

Evelyn agreed. She had been about to log off, but Alexander was quicker.

She wasn’t worried.

But someone else would be.

The moment her laptop powered down, her phone rang.

Dominic Reeves was calling.
###Chapter 195

"Evelyn, have you lost your damn mind? You're acting like a rabid animal! What the hell do you think you're doing?"

Dominic's furious voice exploded through the phone the second Evelyn answered.

She had anticipated his reaction, so she held the phone slightly away from her ear, unfazed.

A cold smirk curled her lips as she replied, "Mr. Reeves, rabid animals attack indiscriminately. But unlike you, I know exactly who I'm targeting—so rest assured, this is only for you."

"You—" Dominic sucked in a sharp breath. If she had been standing in front of him, he would’ve torn her apart.

"Evelyn Carter, I know what this is about. I made sure Sophia Grant wouldn’t be your little lapdog anymore, so now you’re coming after me for revenge."

"Finally, we’re on the same page. Though, I must say—don’t insult animals. They’re far more intelligent and loyal than you could ever hope to be," she shot back, her voice dripping with icy disdain.

She didn’t care if he hurled insults at her, but she would not tolerate him mocking her friends.

Sensing her rising fury, Alexander wrapped his arms around her, pulling her into his embrace. The warmth of his body steadied her. He was her anchor, her unshakable support—no matter what storm raged around them.

"I won’t waste time arguing with you, but don’t think you’ve won. Leaking DR Holdings’ perfume formulas was a low blow, but what you just did was corporate espionage. We will take this to court, and you will pay for the damages. You’ve made a fatal mistake, Evelyn. Sooner or later, you’ll regret it."

Dominic had been in the middle of discussing wedding plans with Vanessa when the board called him in the dead of night, demanding answers. Their most lucrative perfume formulas had been leaked, costing the company millions. Stunned, he scoured the internet, confirming the reports.

There was no doubt—Evelyn was behind this.

But as his rage cooled, he realized she had just handed him a weapon. If she had leaked proprietary information, she could be held legally accountable.

"Corporate espionage?" Evelyn let out a derisive laugh. "Mr. Reeves, don’t make me laugh. Did you forget I never signed an employment contract with DR Holdings? I was never officially hired. So tell me—how could I possibly be liable for leaking information I was never legally bound to protect? How would a nobody like me even get access to such classified data?"

Her tone turned mocking. "Someone as brilliant as you should’ve safeguarded those formulas, shouldn’t you? How could such negligence happen under your watch? Oh, wait—Vanessa Blake invented those formulas, didn’t she? Maybe she was upset with how you treated her and decided to leak them herself?"

"Shut your mouth! Vanessa would never betray me!" Dominic snarled. "You think I can’t prove it was you? I’ll have IT trace the IP addresses of those accounts. You will be exposed."

"Mr. Reeves, those Twitter accounts weren’t mine. How exactly do you plan to prove I had access to confidential information?" She paused, her patience wearing thin.

Then, her voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Let me give you a warning. I’ve known you long enough to uncover a few… interesting secrets. Those lavish gifts for Vanessa? That extravagant trip abroad? I know exactly where that money came from."

A slow, chilling smile spread across her face. "What do you think the board would say if they found out you’ve been embezzling company funds for personal indulgences?"

For the first time, Alexander felt a pang of sorrow beneath his anger. This was the most furious he had ever seen her—her entire body trembling with suppressed rage, as if she were burning from within.
###Chapter 196

"You...you can't prove anything!" Dominic's voice cracked as he scrambled for composure. His blood turned to ice as his mind reeled. How could Evelyn possibly know about his embezzlement from DR Holdings?

This was impossible. He'd been meticulous - not even Vanessa knew about the missing funds. Evelyn was supposed to be buried in her research, oblivious to corporate matters. Dominic gambled on a bluff. "These ridiculous accusations won't hold up in court. Where's your evidence? Keep this up and I'll sue for defamation!"

"Dominic Reeves," Evelyn's voice cut like steel, "do you really think you're untouchable? All these empty legal threats - filing lawsuits only to drop them. You're exhausting. Push me too far, and I guarantee when I press charges, there won't be any out-of-court settlements. You can't win against me. Get that through your thick skull. Do I look like someone who'd make accusations without proof?"

Dominic fell silent, fear creeping up his spine. If DR Holdings' board discovered his financial manipulations, his career would be over. Shareholders would withdraw funding, collapsing the company. For the first time, he saw the true Evelyn Carter - this woman he'd known for five years, dated for three, who'd helped build his empire. He'd never really known her at all.

Sweat slicked his palms as he swallowed hard. "Fine. Let's...negotiate. What do you want?"

"You already know," Evelyn replied icily.

"Sophia Grant? That's what this is about?" Dominic's brow furrowed. "What does she have on you? Why go to such lengths?"

"Someone like you could never understand," Evelyn said with disdain. "Remember - my patience has limits. Don't make me wait." The line went dead.

Alexander observed Evelyn's rigid posture before closing the distance. He wrapped his arms around her from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder. "You don't have to handle this alone. Give it to me - I'll make it disappear. No more wasting breath on that parasite."

Evelyn turned in his embrace, returning the hug fiercely. "I know exactly what you're capable of, Alexander. But this is personal. My mess. My responsibility. I protect what's mine."

Alexander released her with a playful smirk. "I'm starting to feel jealous of that dedication. I wonder if Mrs. Kensington would take care of me as thoroughly as she does Sophia Grant."

Evelyn laughed at his antics but answered with proud conviction, "Without question."
###Chapter 197

Dominic ended the call and took a moment to light a cigarette, inhaling deeply before stepping back into the house. Inside, Vanessa lounged on the sofa, meticulously peeling an orange. She made sure every last bit of pith was removed before popping a segment into her mouth.

"You look troubled," she remarked, her sharp eyes catching the tension in his expression. She wiped her hands clean and straightened up, watching him closely.

Dominic shook his head, unwilling to discuss it.

"You don’t have to tell me—I already have an idea." Vanessa smirked, crossing her legs. "I overheard bits of your conversation. It was Evelyn, wasn’t it? She’s the one who leaked our perfume formula."

Her intuition was uncanny, as if she could read minds.

Since she had already pieced it together, Dominic saw no point in hiding it. He exhaled heavily, strode to the fridge, and cracked open a beer, downing half of it in one go.

"Why are you so worked up? She’s the one who dug her own grave. If she wants to play dirty, let her." Vanessa shrugged, unfazed.

To her, it wasn’t a catastrophe. Ever since their signature perfume formula had been compromised before, she had stopped caring.

Sure, the awards she had won were tied to those perfumes—but they had been Evelyn’s creations. Vanessa had never been involved in the research or production. Without that, her value to DR Holdings had dwindled after the award season.

Once they had milked her for publicity, their focus had shifted solely to profits. After the fallout with Evelyn, Vanessa knew DR Holdings couldn’t coast on past successes. They needed something fresh to keep their clients hooked.

"Easy for you to say. But where’s the proof? We can’t even pin this on Evelyn. Right now, damage control is the priority, not revenge," Dominic explained, rubbing his temples.

The pressure was mounting. The board was breathing down his neck, demanding solutions. They were already displeased with him over the previous production line debacle.

Though the messy dynamic between him, Vanessa, and Evelyn was personal, the board had warned him to keep the company’s image pristine. The shareholders were old-school conservatives. If Dominic wanted to keep his seat as CEO, he had to keep them satisfied.

"Aren’t we already working on a new product?" Vanessa draped her arms over his shoulders, leaning in. "Just tell the board we’re launching a revolutionary line—one that’ll dominate the market. Once it hits, these temporary losses won’t matter."

She smirked. "Besides, the public’s grown bored with our old perfumes. Sales are stagnant. If the formula’s out there, why not spin it? Use this as a PR opportunity to rebrand."

Dominic frowned. "What do you mean?"

"If we can’t prove Evelyn leaked it, we say we did it—to foster healthy competition in the industry. Frame it as sharing trade secrets to push innovation. Turn the scandal into a strategic move."

Her words struck him. Dominic’s expression cleared as he nodded. "That’s brilliant."

Vanessa grinned. "Stop stressing. The real priority is getting our new line to market ASAP. Once it’s a hit, Evelyn won’t even be a blip on our radar. She’s nobody—just a minor nuisance."

Her confidence was absolute.
###Chapter 198

Dominic's mood brightened instantly as he listened to Vanessa. Overjoyed, he lifted her up and spun her in a circle, laughing. "You're absolutely right! Vanessa, you're my lucky charm! With you beside me, I'm unstoppable!"

"Hey, put me down! I'm pregnant, remember?" Vanessa giggled, playfully swatting his arm.

"Oh, right!" He set her down carefully, his hands immediately cradling her belly. "Hey there, little one, you okay?"

"Don't be ridiculous. You can't hear anything yet!" She rolled her eyes, poking his forehead affectionately.

"Of course I can! He's already calling me 'Dad'! Vanessa, I know it hasn't been easy for you. Thank you." He pulled her close, resting his forehead against hers, his voice thick with sincerity.

"Since you know how hard it's been, you'd better spoil me rotten," she murmured, melting into his embrace.

Vanessa had her own motives, of course. Now that she was working with Lucien, she no longer had to worry about DR Holdings' outdated perfume formulas. As long as Lucien kept supplying her with new blends, she could maintain her reputation and stay ahead of the competition.

But Dominic could never find out about her connection to Lucien. With him out of Veridian City, she could finally breathe. Still, she had to nurture this alliance carefully—one misstep, and everything she'd worked for would crumble.

"Vanessa, you smell incredible," Dominic murmured, inhaling deeply. His pulse quickened. "It's been too long..."

"Stop it." She pushed him away lightly, turning her face, but he caught her wrist and pulled her back.

"Are we really not allowed to while you're pregnant?"

Her heart fluttered—not from reluctance, but exhaustion. Thankfully, without Lucien's influence and with Dominic's attentive care, her health had improved. She cupped his face, relenting. "Fine. But be gentle."

Dominic's face lit up. He swept her into his arms, carrying her like royalty. "Don't worry. I'll take care of you."

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at the office only to be summoned into Victoria's room immediately.

"Did you see DR Holdings' Twitter post yesterday?" Victoria gestured for Evelyn to come closer, pointing at her screen. "They've lost their minds! Who does something like this?"

Evelyn frowned, confused, and walked over. The company's official Twitter page was open, displaying a shocking announcement—they claimed responsibility for the recent perfume formula leaks. The scandalous formulas that had gone viral? All part of their signature collection. Their reasoning? They wanted to "foster discussion and innovation" in the industry.

Evelyn was speechless.

This was pure insanity.
###Chapter 199

Dominic Reeves proved himself a master of crisis management, skillfully turning the situation to his advantage. After scanning DR Holdings' official statement, Evelyn Carter realized her PR maneuver had unintentionally given the company positive media coverage.

While some skeptics questioned DR Holdings' motives and the authenticity of the leaked formulas, industry insiders speculated this bold move signaled something major was coming. "What's their endgame here?" Victoria Sterling tapped her chin thoughtfully. "This seems like corporate suicide. Why would they expose proprietary formulas unless they're phasing out their entire legacy product line?"

Victoria's observation highlighted DR Holdings' strategic pivot - abandoning outdated perfumes to rebrand. Though forced into this position by Evelyn's leak, both women wondered if the company could develop new products so quickly.

Their silent exchange was interrupted by a knock. "Ms. Sterling, Ms. Thornton is here to see you," announced the assistant.

"Isabella?" Victoria's brow furrowed in confusion.

"I asked her to come," Evelyn clarified. "Let her in."

"But we agreed she'd take time off before transitioning. You know how difficult—"

"I understand we can't officially hire her yet," Evelyn interrupted, "but DR Holdings will void her non-compete soon. My research has reached a critical phase, and I need all hands on deck. We must launch our new line quickly."

Originally planning to give Isabella space, Evelyn realized she couldn't complete this passion project alone. This debut creation for Phoenix Labs had to be perfect. As a newcomer, having a trusted ally like Isabella was invaluable.

"Hello Ms. Sterling, Evelyn," Isabella greeted nervously, still confused by Evelyn's sudden summons.

"You can start assisting immediately," Evelyn assured her. "Don't worry about DR Holdings - Dominic will release you from your contract."

"Seriously?" Isabella's eyes lit up.

Victoria shot Evelyn a skeptical look. "How? We just received their cease-and-desist yesterday. Unless..." Her gaze dropped to Evelyn's computer screen. "That Twitter leak was yours?"

Isabella gasped. "Evelyn! You shouldn't have risked that for me. If they trace the leak to you—"

The industry was still buzzing about yesterday's explosive revelation, which Isabella had suspected might be Evelyn's doing. While touched by Evelyn's loyalty, she feared the potential consequences. Corporate espionage wasn't a minor offense.
###Chapter 200

It would have been fine if DR Holdings hadn’t cared about this issue. If they wanted to sue Evelyn for leaking trade secrets, so be it. Given Dominic’s vindictive nature, it was unlikely he’d let this slide.

"Don’t worry," Evelyn reassured Sophia, her voice steady. "I wouldn’t have done this if I didn’t already have a plan. DR Holdings won’t be able to use this against you anymore. Just focus on your work here." She gave Sophia’s hand a comforting squeeze.

Evelyn’s eyes sparkled with unwavering confidence, making it clear she wasn’t just offering empty reassurance.

"Evelyn," Sophia hesitated, her brows knitting together. "Tell me you didn’t make some kind of deal with that snake, Dominic?" The thought made her stomach twist. In Sophia’s mind, the only way Evelyn could have resolved this so smoothly was by striking some underhanded bargain. Dominic wasn’t known for his generosity.

Victoria nodded in agreement, her expression tight with concern. "She’s right. Please tell me you didn’t agree to something reckless. You’ve got too much ahead of you to throw it away now."

Evelyn laughed, the sound light and carefree. "You two are acting like I’ve signed my soul away. It’s not that dramatic. There was something resembling a deal, but I’m not the one who had to compromise. Trust me."

"Are you sure?"

Their skepticism was palpable. They feared she was sugarcoating the truth just to ease their worries.

"Absolutely," Evelyn assured them, her tone firm. "In a few days, DR Holdings will withdraw their claims. So, no more resting—you’ll be working for me soon." She gave Sophia’s shoulder a playful nudge.

"I can’t wait," Sophia replied, relief washing over her as she nodded.

The atmosphere in DR Holdings’ shareholder meeting was thick with tension. Dominic resisted the urge to loosen his tie completely—it wouldn’t be professional, no matter how stifling the room felt.

"Mr. Reeves," one of the major shareholders spoke up, his voice icy. "Don’t you think you owe us an explanation about the leaked perfume formulas?"

Dominic remained composed, his expression unreadable. He had anticipated this. Slowly, he spread his hands in a gesture of calm control. "I’m sure you’ve all seen the company’s official statement. Public opinion is still in our favor. Our reputation remains intact. In fact, the benefits of this situation far outweigh the drawbacks. I don’t see a need for further explanation."

"The benefits?" Another shareholder scoffed, his face reddening. "The leak will cause direct financial losses! Who knows how many competitors will replicate our products now? Have you considered the impact on our market position? And you dare claim the pros outweigh the cons? Who exactly will be covering these losses?"

Shareholders cared about one thing—their profits. And now that their money was at risk, they weren’t about to stay silent.

Dominic leaned forward, resting his arms on the table. His voice was smooth, deliberate. "Mr. Hayes, there’s no need for such agitation. Let me explain the financial aspect clearly. The leaked formulas belong to our older products—ones that have been on the market for years. Yes, they’ve generated significant revenue."

He paused, letting his words sink in.

"But let’s be honest—they’ve lost their novelty. Consumers have moved on. This leak? It’s an opportunity to push forward with new innovations." His lips curved into a calculated smile. "And that is where the real profit lies."
###Chapter 201

"No company can survive without innovation. This is something I've been contemplating deeply." Dominic tapped his fingers rhythmically against the polished mahogany table, his sharp gaze sweeping across the room.

"We must adapt before market forces demand it of us." His voice was firm, commanding attention.

"At first glance, it may seem like our competitors have the upper hand, knowing our existing formulas. But let’s not forget—these products have been on the market for years. Even if we hadn’t disclosed them, rival companies would have reverse-engineered them by now."

Dominic leaned forward, his expression intense. "The truth is, even if our current products are selling well, their dominance won’t last. Our focus shouldn’t be on protecting outdated formulas, but on creating something revolutionary. That’s the only way to secure DR Holdings’ future."

His argument was compelling, backed by undeniable logic. The board members, initially skeptical, exchanged thoughtful glances.

"You make a valid point, Mr. Reeves," one director conceded. "But where is this new product? Our quarterly reports show no significant developments in the past six months. And let’s not forget—the last 'innovation' resulted in lawsuits and scandals. Not to mention the crisis last month?"

Another shareholder chimed in. "Exactly. Promises mean nothing without results. We need tangible proof, Mr. Reeves. Something that reassures us of DR Holdings’ stability."

Dominic’s lips curved into a confident smile. "Rest assured, Mr. Montgomery. I wouldn’t bring this up if we weren’t already making progress. We have two new products in development, both nearing completion. And I have every confidence they’ll be market disruptors."

Mr. Montgomery raised an eyebrow. "Is that so? Well, that would certainly be welcome news. Though I’ve heard rumors—wasn’t Evelyn Carter the true mastermind behind our past successes? Vanessa Blake merely took credit?"

Dominic’s expression darkened briefly before smoothing into practiced calm. "Those are baseless accusations. I admit, I was deceived by the wrong person in the past. But this time, Vanessa Blake is leading the development of these new products. Given her track record, I trust her expertise implicitly."

A flicker of warmth crossed his face at the mention of Vanessa. "In fact, I have two announcements to make. First—these new fragrances will represent DR Holdings at the annual Celestia Perfumery Competition. I have no doubt they’ll bring prestige and profit to this company."

He paused, letting the weight of his next words settle. "Second—Vanessa Blake and I are engaged. I assure you all, our personal relationship will not compromise the company’s interests. Together, we’ll ensure DR Holdings thrives."

The room buzzed with murmurs, but the tension had shifted. Dominic’s confidence was infectious.

"If that’s the case," Mr. Montgomery said, raising his glass, "then congratulations are in order. Let’s hope we have two reasons to celebrate in three months."

Dominic smirked. Three reasons, he thought. Vanessa had been right—owning their past mistakes had been the smarter play. Instead of hiding Lily’s deception, they’d confronted it head-on, earning the board’s trust.

She was his secret weapon.

Back in his office, Dominic’s eyes lingered on the framed photograph on his desk—him, Vanessa, and Evelyn, standing together. Most would assume it was a simple group photo, but he knew the truth.

His fingers brushed the glass. In that moment, captured forever, his hand had been discreetly entwined with Vanessa’s.

They’d been together even then.

Evelyn had never noticed. She never paid attention to the details.
###Chapter 202

Evelyn had always been indifferent to such matters, which made Dominic question when she had discovered his misuse of company funds to take Vanessa on lavish vacations and purchase extravagant gifts. The realization unsettled him.

Why had she waited until now to confront him when she must have known for some time?

Two possibilities gnawed at him.

Either Evelyn had only recently uncovered the truth—or she had known all along and deliberately feigned ignorance.

Both scenarios chilled him to the bone.

Their confrontation only deepened his unease, reinforcing the unsettling thought that he had never truly understood her. Was this still the Evelyn he thought he knew?

Dominic's fingers curled into tight fists, his anger simmering dangerously close to eruption.

Outwardly, he had appeared composed during the board meeting, but the night before had been a different story. Panic had clawed at him, the fear of losing shareholder trust nearly suffocating.

One wrong move, and it would have been over.

Fortunately, he had managed to sway them—his silver tongue and carefully crafted explanations had bought him time.

For now.

But if the truth ever surfaced, the fallout would be catastrophic.

He couldn’t afford to gamble on whether Evelyn had evidence. After a tense internal debate, he conceded.

If she wanted Sophia, then fine.

He would hand her over without hesitation.

Sophia was nothing but dead weight anyway. If Evelyn was so eager to take her, he’d gladly oblige.

Once Vanessa successfully launched the new product line and secured the industry award, profits would flood in effortlessly.

Would Evelyn even matter then?

Dominic snatched up the phone and dialed an extension, his voice clipped and authoritative.

"This is Dominic Reeves. Revoke Sophia Grant’s non-compete clause immediately. Yes, that’s all. Consider it handled."

Vanessa returned to the lab after a brief hiatus, though she wasn’t eager to immerse herself in the sterile, chemical-laden environment again.

The acrid scents of solvents and reagents made her nose wrinkle in distaste.

But she had no choice.

She had "authored" the formula, but appearances mattered. She needed to be seen actively involved in the R&D process—supervising, participating, ensuring no one could accuse her of fraud later.

Especially not if someone like Evelyn decided to interfere again.

The thought alone made her stomach twist.

She couldn’t afford another misstep.
###Chapter 203

The hum of creativity was always intoxicating. Vanessa longed to immerse herself in the process, but the moment she stepped into the lab, a wave of nausea crashed over her.

Being confined in that space for too long made her stomach churn.

She sighed, rubbing her temples. It was understandable—forgivable, even. Pregnancy had its own set of rules, and her body was no longer just hers. Setting down her sketchpad, she retreated to the lounge outside, opting to supervise from a distance instead.

A steaming cup of coffee sat untouched on the table. She knew the risks—too much caffeine wasn’t ideal for the baby. But then again, was she even keeping it?

The question gnawed at her. Dominic wanted this child desperately. An abortion would fracture their already fragile relationship.

Yet…

What a mess.

Her phone buzzed, snapping her out of her thoughts. She expected Dominic’s name to flash across the screen, but it was Lucien. Her pulse spiked.

Glancing around, she confirmed she was alone before snatching up the phone and slipping into the quiet of the hallway.

"Hello?"

"Ma chérie, did you miss me?" His voice was smooth, laced with playful arrogance.

Vanessa exhaled, slipping into the role effortlessly. "Of course I did. I wish you were here right now. But I know your art comes first, so I’ll just have to suffer in silence." She knew exactly what he wanted to hear.

"Really?" He sounded pleased. "And what are you up to now?"

"I’m in the lab. The formula is crucial, so I’m handling it personally. Wouldn’t dare disappoint you." Flattery first, then the ask. She softened her tone. "I think these two scents could dominate the annual perfumery competition. Speaking of… will you be there?"

Lucien chuckled, sharp as a blade. "Ah, so that’s what this is about. Fishing for insider information, are we?"

She didn’t bother denying it.

"Maybe. Is there a chance to… sway the judges?"

His laugh was low, knowing. "Do you really want this opportunity?"

Her breath hitched. Was he implying—?

"Wait. Are you judging this year?"

The competition was notoriously strict. Judges were handpicked from international experts, their identities kept secret until the event. Bribing them in advance was impossible.

But if Lucien was on the panel…

Her mind raced. With his influence, his connections, his vote—winning would be effortless. The gold medal might as well already be in her hands.

A slow, triumphant smile curled her lips.
###Chapter 204

"If you truly desire it, you must grasp every opportunity!" His voice carried a weight of implication before the line went dead.

Vanessa didn’t comprehend Lucien’s cryptic message until her phone buzzed with an address. It was in Veridian City—not far from the lab’s location.

In a heartbeat, realization struck. Lucien was already on his way. Her fingers trembled around the phone. She hadn’t expected his return so soon. Clearly, this was meant to be a clandestine meeting.

A part of her wanted to refuse. This wasn’t Silverpine Valley—this was Veridian City. The risk of being recognized was high, especially with Dominic lurking nearby. If anyone saw them…

Her pulse hammered in conflict. Lucien had spoken casually, his tone almost indifferent. But the decision was ruthless.

Declining meant rejecting him—and with it, any leverage she held in the annual perfume competition’s judging panel.

Vanessa had already taken the first step. There was no turning back now. No matter the cost, she would push forward. She just needed to find a way to survive this—before her body gave out entirely.

After a tense moment of deliberation, she made her choice.

She hurried downstairs, hailed a cab, and gave the driver the address. A hotel. Of course. Lucien never stayed anywhere for long. A few days, then he’d vanish again.

She had no idea where he went after leaving Veridian City, nor did she care. She only needed him for one thing.

Vanessa kept her head low, avoiding the security cameras as she adjusted the scarf wrapped tightly around her face. The elevator ride felt endless. When she reached the correct floor, she hesitated only a second before knocking.

The door swung open—but not to the embrace she’d anticipated.

Lucien barely glanced at her before turning away, leaving the door ajar.

He hadn’t even bothered to change. His shirt hung half-buttoned, his hair disheveled.

Unease prickled down her spine as she stepped inside, locking the door behind her. She removed her sunglasses and scarf, then approached him cautiously.

Wrapping her arms around his waist from behind, she murmured, "What’s wrong? Aren’t you happy to see me?"

He patted her hand absently before pulling free and sinking onto the couch. His gaze flicked up at her, sharp but distant, before he reached for a slender tube on the table.

Only then did Vanessa notice what lay scattered across the surface.

She’d seen it in films—never in person. A cold dread slithered through her.

"Lucien, you—"

He ignored her, closing his eyes as he leaned back. The world around him dissolved. Nothing mattered. Nothing existed beyond the haze he’d willingly surrendered to.

Vanessa could only stare, frozen in shock.
###Chapter 205

Vanessa wanted to run. Every instinct screamed at her to flee, yet her feet refused to obey. They stayed rooted to the floor, as if shackled by invisible chains. Her mind raced through every terrible possibility, each one colder than the last, until her entire body trembled.

"Lucien," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

He appeared asleep, sprawled across the couch, his breathing slow and even. This was her chance. She could slip away unnoticed, pretend she had never seen a thing.

Then his eyes snapped open.

Dark, gleaming, and fully alert, they locked onto hers with unnerving precision.

Vanessa gasped, stumbling back in shock.

Lucien smirked, the curve of his lips lazy and cruel. He pushed himself up, sweeping the scattered items off the table with a careless flick of his wrist. They clattered into the trash bin, discarded like afterthoughts. Then he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, slow and deliberate, before rising to his feet.

Her pulse spiked as he advanced. Step by step, he closed the distance, forcing her backward until her shoulders hit the wall. Trapped.

"Lucien, no—!" She flinched as he lifted his hand, squeezing her eyes shut.

But the blow never came.

Instead, his palm slammed against the wall beside her head, caging her in. He tilted his head, studying her with amusement. "What are you so afraid of?"

"N-nothing," she lied, her voice shaking.

"Really?" His fingers caught her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Open your eyes."

She didn’t. Couldn’t. If she kept them closed, maybe she could pretend this wasn’t happening.

His thumb brushed her lower lip, feather-light. "If you don’t open them," he murmured, "I’ll make you swallow every last thing you just saw."

Her eyes flew open—wide, terrified.

Lucien chuckled, pleased. "Good girl. I like obedience."

"I—I won’t tell anyone," she blurted, desperate. "I swear!"

He laughed outright, the sound dark and mocking. "Do you really think I care if you do?"

Vanessa swallowed. Of course he didn’t. Lucien wasn’t afraid of consequences. He thrived on them.

"Lucien," she whispered, "I’ll do anything. Just… not this. Please."

"Please?" He tilted his head, amused. Then, abruptly, he caught her wrist, his grip firm. "Fine," he said, as if granting a favor. "We’ll do it your way."
###Chapter 206

Vanessa blinked in confusion as Lucien released her hand abruptly and turned away. He strode back to the coffee table, retrieving a pack of cigarettes with practiced ease. The metallic click of the lighter echoed in the tense silence as he lit one, exhaling smoke towards the window while staring at something beyond the glass.

Her bare shoulders prickled with unease. Why had he shown her that disturbing scene if he didn't intend to involve her? The memory of what she'd witnessed made her stomach churn. She inched closer, studying his rigid posture, the way his fingers tapped impatiently against the windowsill.

The silk robe slipped from one shoulder as she hesitated. Lucien took a long drag before finally turning. His gaze swept over her disheveled state with clinical detachment, lingering just long enough to make her skin crawl.

Vanessa held her breath. Was this it? Had he grown bored of her? The thought brought equal parts relief and panic. Freedom from his twisted games would be a blessing, but without his connections, how would she secure her place in the upcoming competition?

Her mind raced. Before he could speak, she closed the distance between them, pressing herself against his chest. "Tell me what's wrong," she murmured, fingers tracing the buttons of his shirt. "I'll learn whatever you want. I can be exactly what you need."

Lucien didn't push her away. He simply exhaled another cloud of smoke before tapping the cigarette ash into a nearby tray. His free hand came up to pat her head like one might comfort a pet. "You're exquisite, darling. But even the finest wine grows tiresome after too many glasses."

Vanessa's grip tightened. "Then let me be something new. Name your fantasy." The annual showcase loomed in her thoughts - she couldn't lose his backing now.

A humorless chuckle rumbled through his chest. "It's not about costumes or roles, sweetheart. The problem is..." His fingers tilted her chin up. "You're still you."

The words stung more than any physical mark he'd ever left. "So you've found someone else?" she whispered, forcing her voice to waver.

Lucien's gaze grew distant, his thumb absently stroking her cheekbone. For a fleeting moment, she saw genuine longing in his eyes - but not for her. The realization burned hotter than shame.

"Long-term arrangements needn't preclude... fresh inspiration," he said smoothly, as if discussing stock portfolios rather than betrayal. "Surely you understand?"

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms. "You want my help seducing your new obsession?" The absurdity nearly made her laugh.

His answering grin was all sharp edges. "Clever girl. And here I thought you might be jealous."

"Please." She forced a smirk, though her jaw ached with tension. "We both know what this is." The unspoken truth hung between them - no hearts would break over this transaction.

When Lucien finally stepped back, Vanessa found her composure returning like armor clicking into place. She met his gaze evenly. "Actually, I might know just the person for you." The idea forming in her mind was dangerous, possibly reckless. Perfect.
###Chapter 207

"Oh?" Lucien finally showed a flicker of interest. "Do I know her?"

"You've seen her before," Vanessa replied with a knowing smile. "Remember Evelyn Carter?"

"Your so-called rival?" Lucien stroked his chin, the image of the striking woman flashing through his mind.

Truthfully, she had left an impression the first time he laid eyes on her. He'd had his own thoughts back then but never got the chance to act.

Vanessa scoffed. "Rival? Please. She's not even worth the title. But if you're looking for a change of pace, she might not be a bad choice."

Lucien had little patience for petty female drama, but the idea of a new diversion intrigued him. "True, she isn't," he mused. Then, after a beat, he added, "Though, from what I hear, she's no longer with DR Holdings. She's in the same sinking ship as you. You really think you can persuade her?"

Vanessa shook her head and perched on the edge of the sofa. "Must you always resort to the same tactics? There are other ways to get what you want."

"I don't force people," he said smoothly.

Vanessa rolled her eyes. "Lucien, you claim to love new experiences. Why not try something different? Forbidden fruit is always the sweetest."

His dark gaze locked onto hers, and she saw the spark of hunger in his eyes. Men were all the same—always chasing what they couldn't have. Once they got it, the thrill faded.

Lucien had used every trick in the book to manipulate Vanessa. Soon enough, he grew bored and set his sights on Evelyn. But for Vanessa, this was perfect. It kept her alliance with Lucien intact while letting her settle an old score. A win-win.

"So, you already have a plan?" he asked.

"Of course," she purred. "But timing is everything. Don’t worry—I’ll make sure you get what you want. Just don’t forget your promise to me."

Lucien closed the distance between them, tilting her chin up with his fingers. Vanessa murmured, "Don’t discard the old when you find something new."

"You’re far too good to me," he murmured before pressing his lips to hers.

Vanessa stiffened slightly. She knew exactly what he'd been doing just half an hour ago, but she didn’t dare pull away. Instead, she placed a hand on his chest and ducked her head, feigning shyness. "I thought you’d lost interest in me."

"I changed my mind," he said, brushing a kiss to her forehead.

Vanessa stayed silent.

Later, when they were done, she rose without a word, smoothing her clothes back into place with practiced ease. Meanwhile, Lucien sprawled across the bed, arms outstretched, the sheet barely covering his waist as he drifted into sleep.
###Chapter 208

Vanessa hadn’t paid much attention before—she’d been too terrified. But now, as she studied him, she realized just how gaunt he looked. Far thinner than any man should be.

She understood why now, and unease coiled in her stomach.

If Lucien was capable of something like this, he was already halfway to damnation. Vanessa didn’t know if someone would uncover the truth eventually. She had no idea how long he could last in the industry.

But one thing was certain—she couldn’t rely on him forever.

She had thought she’d found a powerful ally, that clinging to him would secure her victory. Reality, however, had slapped her hard.

No one could be depended on entirely.

Not Dominic.

Not Lucien.

She needed more. More leverage, more security. Only then could she breathe easy.

Still, she wasn’t in a rush. Lucien could still be useful for now. She’d play along, hand over Evelyn, and squeeze every last drop of advantage from him before cutting ties.

Stepping out of the room, she took the elevator down. When she checked her phone, her screen was flooded with missed calls and messages—all from Dominic.

What’s happened? Why is he so frantic?

She powered off her phone and slipped it into her purse without a second thought. Then she strode out of the hotel and hailed a cab.

By the time she reached home, Dominic was already waiting, just as she’d expected.

"Where the hell have you been, Vanessa? Why weren’t you answering your phone?" His voice was sharp, his expression thunderous.

She froze, widening her eyes in feigned alarm. "D-Dominic? You’re back already?"

"Answer me!" His hands clenched at his sides. "Where were you?"

She bit her lip, shrinking back slightly. "I’ll tell you… but you have to promise not to get mad."

"Fine. Talk."

Dominic had come home early, wanting to surprise her. Instead, he’d found an empty apartment—no note, no explanation. No response to his calls.

His worry had spiraled into frustration, then fury.

"I… I went to DR Holdings."

"DR Holdings?" His jaw tightened. "I called them. They said you left hours ago. I told you not to go there! What were you thinking? Do you even care about the baby?"

She hadn’t expected him to check, but she recovered quickly.

"I went to review the new product specs. It’s my formula—I had to make sure everything was perfect. I haven’t worked in so long, I was afraid something might go wrong again." She lowered her gaze, pouting. "I did it for DR Holdings. For us."

She let her voice waver. "But after a while, I started feeling sick. I thought… maybe I’d inhaled too many fumes. So I went to the hospital for a checkup."

Tears welled in her eyes. "Do you really think I don’t care about this baby? It’s inside me. I worry more than anyone!"

Her voice cracked. "And you—you just yell at me? After all your promises? You swore you’d take care of me, love me forever. But it’s all lies! You only care about the baby, not me!"

She spun on her heel. "Fine. I’ll just get rid of it, and we can be done!"

Dominic’s anger evaporated the moment her tears fell. Panic surged as she turned to leave.
###Chapter 209

Dominic wrapped his arms around Vanessa from behind, his voice thick with remorse. "Don't be mad, Vanessa. I was wrong—completely wrong."

His lips brushed the nape of her neck as he murmured, "I shouldn’t have yelled at you. It’s not just about the baby. It’s you. You’re everything to me."

Vanessa stiffened, but before she could pull away, Dominic reached into his pocket. He had planned something far more elaborate, but right now, all that mattered was seeing her smile again.

The velvet box snapped open, revealing a diamond so brilliant it stole her breath.

Her tears halted mid-fall.

Dominic dropped to one knee, his gaze unwavering. "I know I’ve put you through hell, Vanessa. I see how hard you’ve worked—for me, for us." He swallowed hard. "Let me make it up to you. Let me spend the rest of my life proving how much you mean to me."

The ring glinted under the light, its size bordering on obscene.

Vanessa’s fingers trembled as she extended her hand.

Dominic slid the ring onto her finger, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. "I love you."

She threw her arms around his neck. "I love you too."

For now, the question of the baby could wait.

Evelyn hadn’t slept properly in days.

The lab was her second home now, the scent of chemicals clinging to her clothes. This was the final stretch—the last hurdle before her perfume formula could be perfected.

If it passed inspection, it would be her greatest triumph.

If not…

She shoved the thought aside.

Sophia stifled a yawn beside her, rubbing her bleary eyes. "We’re almost there," Evelyn said gently. "Go rest. I’ll handle this."

Sophia shook her head stubbornly. "No way. You drilled it into me—never leave a reaction unattended."

Evelyn smiled despite herself.

Her notebook lay open, pages crammed with meticulous notes. Tiny, hidden smiley faces dotted the margins—her secret way of keeping morale up.

Midnight approached.

Somewhere in Crestview Heights, Alexander was probably asleep.

Or maybe not.

Evelyn exhaled, refocusing on the apparatus before her.

The night was far from over.
###Chapter 210

The morning sun painted golden streaks across the sky as Evelyn Carter dialed Alexander Kensington's number. Her fingers trembled slightly—she half-expected him to brush her off.

To her surprise, he answered on the second ring, his deep voice smooth and agreeable. No arguments, no hesitation. She blinked, wondering if she had misheard.

But time was slipping away. The experiment demanded her full attention.

Just one more night.

Once the product was finalized, she would finally take a break. A real one. Maybe even steal a quiet dinner with Alexander. The thought made her lips curve as she refocused, meticulously repeating each test step.

Isabella Thornton splashed cold water on her face, the shock jolting her awake. As she stepped out of the restroom, her gaze locked onto a towering figure striding down the hallway.

Two oversized bags dangled from his hands.

"Stop right there!" Her voice sliced through the sterile air. She sprinted forward, blocking his path with her arms crossed. "Who are you? This area is restricted."

The man—easily a foot taller—paused. His sharp jawline and piercing gaze screamed authority, but Isabella wasn’t intimidated. She tilted her chin up, meeting his stare head-on.

He arched a brow, unimpressed. "I’m with DR Holdings."

"Bullshit." Her eyes narrowed. "I know every employee here. Name. Department. Supervisor. Now."

This was the critical phase of the experiment. After the sabotage last month, she trusted no one. Especially not some stranger waltzing in unannounced.

Harrison’s lips twitched. In all his years as Alexander’s right-hand man, no one had dared interrogate him like this.

"I’m here for Ms. Carter," he said flatly.

Isabella’s guard shot higher. "Why? She’s swamped. Whatever you have, say it to me."

Harrison exhaled, fishing out his phone. Then she noticed the bags—snacks, energy drinks, and… clothes?

Her suspicion deepened. "What’s all this?"

He shrugged. "Care package. Boss’s orders."

Isabella’s eyes darted between him and the bags. Something wasn’t adding up.

And she intended to find out what.
###Chapter 211

“And you are…?” Only then did Evelyn realize something was odd.

“It’s going to be chilly tonight. Here are Ms. Carter’s jacket, blanket, and some snacks. I’d appreciate it if you could pass them to her.” Harrison stepped forward, took in Evelyn’s bewildered expression, shoved the items into her hands, and turned to leave without another word.

His task was simply to deliver the items. He didn’t need to see Evelyn in person.

“Wait, you—” Evelyn snapped out of her daze, but the man was already halfway to the elevator, his long strides covering the distance effortlessly.

She returned to the lab, arms laden with the bags. Inside, Evelyn found Evelyn hunched over her workstation, completely absorbed in her samples. “Delivery!” Evelyn called out from the doorway.

Evelyn turned, blinking at the sight of the two large bags. “I thought you went to freshen up. How did you manage to get delivery so fast?”

Evelyn scoffed. “What delivery service operates at this speed? I didn’t order anything. Your guardian angel dropped these off.”

Realization dawned on Evelyn. Late at night, Alexander had sent clothes and food—so meticulously thoughtful. If he wasn’t her guardian angel, who was?

“Guardian angel?” Evelyn feigned ignorance, but as she unzipped one of the bags and spotted her jacket and blanket, she knew exactly who was responsible.

Hadn’t Alexander insisted on keeping their relationship private? Yet here he was, boldly showing up at her workplace. Even if it was brief, he could’ve been seen. “Where is he?” She craned her neck, scanning the hallway.

“Gone.” Evelyn waved a hand, amused by Evelyn’s reaction. “So it was him! What’s the big deal? He’s not some mythical creature—just a guy who cares enough to bring you food and clothes in the middle of the night. That already puts him ahead of most useless men out there.”

Evelyn’s lips pursed. “Incomparable.” After experiencing the best, nothing else measured up. Comparing Dominic to Alexander? Laughable. Her expression twisted with disdain.

Evelyn chuckled. “Right, right, incomparable. Though, between you and me, he’s a bit awkward—not the smoothest talker, and his looks are… well, average. But hey, points for effort.”

Evelyn gaped.

Awkward? Average-looking?

She pictured Alexander—his effortless elegance, the way he carried himself like royalty. And here was Evelyn, calling him ugly.

“Evelyn,” she said slowly, “are your eyes broken?”

Evelyn huffed. “Even if my word choice was off, don’t attack my taste. I have excellent taste.” She folded her arms, doubling down.

Evelyn sighed. Maybe beauty truly was subjective. Not everyone could appreciate Alexander’s perfection.
###Chapter 212

Perhaps Evelyn's taste was a bit unconventional.

"Whatever. You're hungry, so let's eat." The takeout in the bag was still steaming. Coincidentally, Sophia was starving. She carried the food to the outdoor table to share.

She brushed off the earlier question, but Evelyn couldn't let it go. Even as they sat down and picked up their utensils, she lifted her head and demanded, "Which part of my description was inaccurate?"

Sophia was at a loss for words.

"Fine, then tell me—how exactly was he awkward in the way he handled things?"

After a moment of thought, Sophia conceded that appearances were subjective. But Dominic's professionalism? Far from awkward.

"I asked him who he was and why he was here, and it took him forever to just say he was from DR Holdings. Think about it. Me. I barely arrived, and I already know everyone here. One look at him, and I knew he wasn't from the company. Forget everything else—he tried to lie about that. Isn't that awkward?"

Evelyn analyzed, "If he came for you, he should've just said so. Making up some excuse about being from the company? Ridiculous."

When she finished, she noticed Sophia's silence and worried she'd crossed a line. Hesitantly, she added, "Though... maybe it means he's honest. Bad liars usually are."

What Evelyn didn't know was that Sophia was replaying her words, imagining Dominic saying this in front of the press.

Technically, Dominic was from DR Holdings. That much was true. But lower-level employees rarely saw him. Even Vanessa had only met him a handful of times, let alone regular staff. Evelyn was new—of course she wouldn’t recognize him.

Now that Evelyn mentioned it, his behavior had been a little stiff. "And... the ugly part?" Sophia pressed after a pause. Even if tastes differed, could their perceptions really be that different?

"I—I was just being honest. Don’t be mad," Evelyn backtracked nervously. After all, Dominic was Sophia’s new boyfriend. Criticizing him while eating his food felt wrong.

"I’m not mad," Sophia assured with a shake of her head.

This was just girl talk. Sophia knew Evelyn meant no harm. She pressed because she was curious—how did others see Dominic?

Magazines and media painted him as ruthless, decisive, a force of nature. His looks? National treasure status. Critics might slam his methods or icy demeanor, but never his face.

Sophia had been utterly captivated by him. Evelyn, clearly, was another story. So she listened.

"Actually..." Evelyn tapped her fork against her lips, reconsidering. "He wasn’t bad-looking."

Sophia’s lashes fluttered. "Wasn’t bad?"

"On closer inspection, he’s decent. Just... his jaw’s a bit too square. Slimmer, and he’d be sharper. He’s tall and solid, though—good for protection."

Sophia narrowed her eyes, mentally comparing the description to Dominic’s face.

A square jaw? Solid? "Are we talking about the same person?" Suspicion crept into her voice.
###Chapter 213

Evelyn was baffled when Sophia blurted, "Wait! How many boyfriends do you actually have?" Evelyn froze, her gaze sharpening.

Sophia immediately clamped her mouth shut.

Then, frowning, Sophia muttered, "If we're not talking about the same person, then it wasn’t your boyfriend who dropped off those things earlier? That’s impossible! Harrison was carrying so much—your personal stuff, too—in the dead of night. He didn’t even speak. Just handed them to me and left."

Evelyn’s mind raced as she pieced it together. She held up a hand. "Hold on."

She fished her phone from her pocket. There were no photos of Harrison saved, and a quick search yielded nothing.

Locking eyes with Sophia’s expectant stare, Evelyn opened WhatsApp and typed to Alexander: Send me a picture of Harrison.

If her hunch was right, it had to be Harrison who’d come, not Alexander. If Alexander had bothered to show up himself, he wouldn’t have just dumped her things with Sophia and vanished. That wasn’t his style.

"Just wait," Evelyn told Sophia.

The message sent, she waited. Alexander was definitely awake—he wouldn’t have sent Harrison otherwise. What she didn’t know was that he wasn’t just awake. He was parked on the street outside, engine off.

The sleek black Porsche sat silently under the dim streetlights. Inside, Alexander leaned back, eyes closed. Knowing Evelyn was pulling an all-nighter, sleep had been impossible. When the temperature plummeted, he’d gathered her essentials and come.

But he understood the critical phase of her experiment. No distractions. So he’d sent Harrison up instead.

His phone buzzed twice. Alexander’s eyes snapped open. The screen’s glow illuminated his sharp frown.

Harrison, oblivious in the driver’s seat, still felt the sudden chill creeping down his spine. He glanced at the rearview mirror—and met his boss’s unreadable, dark gaze.

"Sir?"

Alexander studied him for a long moment before looking back at his phone. His wife had asked for a photo. Of Harrison. Not him.

His voice dropped dangerously low. "Harrison. Turn around."

Harrison blinked. "Sir?"

"Turn around." The edge in Alexander’s tone brooked no argument.

Swallowing hard, Harrison obeyed. Alexander raised his phone and snapped a picture.

Harrison’s stomach knotted. Why did Mr. Kensington need his photo? Was this some kind of pre-mission dossier? Something he wouldn’t return from?

Evelyn’s phone pinged. She opened the image—a crisp, close-up shot of Harrison’s face. Every detail was clear, from the stern set of his jaw to the faint scar above his brow. Exactly as Sophia had described: square-faced, thick brows, intense eyes.

She turned the screen to Sophia. "This him?"

Sophia’s eyes widened. "Yes! That’s him! Wait—he’s not your boyfriend?!"
###Chapter 214

"It's not him." Shaking her head, Evelyn sighed as she continued to type.

What a ridiculous misunderstanding. She had just compared Isabella's description of Harrison to Dominic. Evelyn felt utterly foolish.

Though the photo was slightly blurred, Evelyn could tell Dominic was in the car with Harrison from the quick reply and freshly-taken appearance.

Before she could pinpoint their location, another message flashed from Dominic: "Want more?"

Evelyn knew he meant Harrison's photos. "No need, that's enough," she typed hastily.

Why would she need multiple photos of Harrison? She only wanted to clear up Isabella's confusion. Then more texts arrived.

"Sure you don't need it?"
"Don't you want mine?"

"Pfft—" Evelyn choked on her water, coughing violently. Though just cold text on a screen, she could practically feel Dominic's displeasure radiating through. Was he seriously jealous she hadn't asked for his photo?

"You okay?" Isabella patted her back curiously. "Who are you texting? And who was that guy if not your boyfriend? Why would he deliver something so late? And why do you have his photo?"

The questions piled up, making Isabella increasingly suspicious. Something felt off, but she couldn't pinpoint what.

Still coughing, Evelyn waved a hand. She needed to appease Dominic first. Snatching her phone, she typed: "I have you in person. Why would I need photos?"

In the car, Dominic stared at his screen. The tense line of his mouth finally curved into a smile.

Harrison watched his boss through the rearview mirror, horrified. The man had been scowling for hours—what witchcraft caused this sudden change?

"I'll take photos when I get back, okay?" Evelyn added, hoping to seal the deal.

"Fine." Dominic's reply came instantly.

Evelyn exhaled in relief—then jumped when she found Isabella's face inches from hers.

"Ugh," Isabella fake-gagged, "since when are you so corny? I think I just got diabetes!"

Amused, Evelyn stood and ruffled Isabella's hair. "Enough. Finish eating and get back to work. Clean this up while I check the results."

"Sure, boss." Isabella smirked. "Wouldn't want to delay your romantic photoshoot." She added slyly, "Speaking of which—why show me that guy's photo? I want to see your boyfriend!"

Evelyn paused at the doorway, hand on the frame. "Sounds like I didn't give you enough work tonight."

"I've been pulling an all-nighter with you! This is my entertainment tax!"

As Isabella gathered trash, she recalled the name on Evelyn's screen. "Wait... Dominic Kensington? Why does that sound familiar?"

Evelyn froze.
###Chapter 215

Evelyn stood up to toss the empty coffee cup into the bin. As she approached Sophia, she furrowed her brows, trying to place the name. It rang a bell, but she couldn’t quite grasp why.

Noticing Evelyn’s struggle, Sophia reached out and gave her arm a playful tap. "It’s the CEO of Celestia Group."

"Oh—right! That’s where I’ve heard it before! The CEO of Celest—" Evelyn’s words caught in her throat. Her eyes widened as she stared at Sophia, disbelief written all over her face.

Sophia wasn’t surprised by her reaction. She had anticipated this. Honestly, she was still baffled herself by Alexander Kensington’s willingness to entertain her so-called "proposal."

Even now, she couldn’t fathom why a man like him would go out of his way to indulge her. But the fact remained—she was Mrs. Kensington.

"Celestia Group?! The CEO of Celestia Group?!" Evelyn finally managed to choke out, her voice barely above a whisper.

Her mind reeled. This was beyond shocking. She had known Evelyn was seeing someone new, but she never imagined it would be someone of that caliber.

"Evelyn…" Sophia’s grip on her arm tightened. "Tell me you’re not his mistress."

Evelyn scoffed and flicked Sophia’s forehead. "Seriously? That’s the first place your mind goes?"

"Ow! Okay, okay, I take it back!" Sophia rubbed her forehead, wincing. "But come on—CEO of Celestia Group?! How is that even possible?"

She still couldn’t wrap her head around it. "Evelyn, are you for real? Is he actually your boyfriend? You’re together?"

It wasn’t that Sophia was being nosy or judgmental. She just couldn’t fathom how these two worlds had collided. Alexander Kensington was practically a myth—someone she never expected to cross paths with, let alone be dating her best friend.

Evelyn hadn’t planned on telling her, but Sophia had already seen the texts. Even if she kept it quiet now, the name "Alexander Kensington" would eventually click. Better to come clean now than deal with the fallout later. Besides, she trusted Sophia.

"Yeah," Evelyn admitted with a sigh. "But keep it to yourself, okay? We’re not making it public."

Sophia blinked. "Wait, why? If you’re in a real relationship, why hide it? Is he ashamed of you? Is he even serious about this?"

The rapid-fire questions made Evelyn regret not saving Alexander’s number under a fake name. She hadn’t expected Sophia to see it.
###Chapter 216

If Isabella, who had been her closest confidant for years, reacted with such shock, Evelyn couldn't fathom how the world would respond to this revelation.

It only confirmed one thing—her relationship with Alexander Kensington had to remain a secret for now.

"No!" Evelyn placed both hands on Bella's shoulders, her voice steady but urgent. "Listen to me. You know exactly who he is. If this got out, can you imagine the fallout? Even you struggled to process it—what hope do we have with the public? The scrutiny would drown me. I wouldn’t have the space to breathe, let alone focus on my work."

"It’s not that I can’t accept it," Bella rushed to explain, her eyes wide. "I just never expected—"

"I know," Evelyn cut in gently. "But not everyone will see it the way you do. With his influence, the moment this goes public, we’ll both be under a microscope. I need to stand on my own first. I need to prove I belong in his world before the world decides for me."

Bella exhaled, nodding slowly as understanding settled in. "Evelyn… I believe in you. You’ll get there."

A small, determined smile curved Evelyn’s lips. "I will."

She turned back to the lab bench just as the computer chimed, spitting out the final data results. The air was thick with the delicate, intoxicating fragrance of their creation—a scent that whispered of triumph.

Evelyn bent over the printout, her fingers tracing the numbers with reverence. Behind her, Bella meticulously checked the samples, both women lost in the silent thrill of their breakthrough.

Then—

"Success!" Bella nearly shouted, spinning around with a grin. "Evelyn, we did it!"

Evelyn’s chest swelled with exhilaration. "The data is perfect. The scent profile—exactly as I envisioned." She laughed, breathless. "We actually pulled it off."

This was her first independent formula since leaving DR Holdings. A gamble. A statement. And now, it was real.

"All those sleepless nights were worth it," Bella sighed, already moving to secure their work. "I’ll catalog everything and lock it up. We should get out of here—it’s practically morning."

Evelyn shut down the lab equipment, washing the scent of chemicals from her hands. When she returned, Bella had already sealed the samples away, her expression alight with pride.

They shared a look, the unspoken joy between them brighter than any words.

As they headed for the elevator, Bella pulled out her phone. "It’s late—well, early. Let’s share a cab. Safer that way, don’t you think?"

Evelyn nodded, but her mind was already racing ahead. This was just the beginning.

And the world wasn’t ready for what came next.
###Chapter 217

Evelyn didn’t respond because her gaze was fixed on a sleek black car parked across the street. It stood out starkly against the quiet, dimly lit road, its back door wide open. A tall, imposing figure stepped out, pausing for a moment before turning and walking straight toward her.

"Evelyn?" Sophia called again when she received no answer. Following Evelyn’s line of sight, she spotted the approaching man. Even in the faint glow of the streetlights, his presence was magnetic—sharp features, an effortless grace that made it impossible to look away.

It felt like a scene from a film, Sophia thought. The way he moved, the way Evelyn’s breath hitched ever so slightly—she didn’t need an introduction to know exactly who he was.

"So, it was you," Evelyn murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

She had suspected Alexander might be nearby after Harrison’s earlier messages and the cryptic photo he’d sent. But she had been too absorbed in the final stages of her experiment to dwell on it.

"Why aren’t you wearing the coat I sent?" Alexander frowned, his disapproval evident as he took in her thin long-sleeved shirt. Without waiting for an answer, he shrugged off his tailored jacket and draped it over her shoulders.

Evelyn tugged the fabric closer, savoring the lingering warmth. "I was busy. Didn’t think I’d need it."

"Let’s go home," he said, his voice low but firm.

She nodded, then glanced at Sophia, who was staring at Alexander with wide, unblinking eyes. Evelyn bit back a laugh—she couldn’t blame her. Alexander had that effect on people.

"Sophia, come with us. It’s late, and cabs are scarce. We’ll drop you off," Evelyn offered, looping an arm around her friend’s shoulders.

Sophia shook her head frantically. "No, no, I’m fine! I don’t want to intrude—"

"Don’t be ridiculous," Evelyn cut in, steering her toward the car. "It’s not safe this late."

With a resigned sigh, Sophia let herself be led, though she shot one last nervous glance at Alexander, who followed behind them with an amused expression.

The interior of the car was warm, the scent of leather and something faintly spicy enveloping them. Harrison, perched in the back seat, turned his head—then froze when he caught sight of Sophia.

"Y-You!" Sophia gasped, clapping a hand over her mouth as if she’d spoken out of turn. Her eyes darted between Harrison and Evelyn, realization dawning.

Evelyn smirked. This was going to be interesting.
###Chapter 218

"He's Mr. Kensington's driver!" Of course, Harrison was the one who had delivered everything for his boss.

No wonder Isabella had mistaken Harrison for Evelyn's boyfriend.

"Thanks for bringing those things earlier, Harrison," Evelyn said as she slid into the car. She hadn't seen him earlier but knew she owed him gratitude for coming out so late. "You're welcome, Madam," Harrison replied, glancing briefly at Isabella before gripping the steering wheel.

"Oh, by the way, this is Isabella. My assistant and best friend," Evelyn introduced them properly. "Bella, this is Alexander's assistant, Harrison."

Isabella nodded. Noticing Harrison hadn't turned around, she leaned forward and tapped his shoulder. "Sorry about earlier!"

Harrison startled, twisting to look at her. "What?"

"I didn’t realize who you were. Thought you were some corporate spy sneaking around, so I was kind of rude. My bad!" Isabella had a blunt, straightforward personality—she wasn’t the type to hold grudges. She’d acted harshly because she genuinely believed he was stealing trade secrets. Now that she knew the truth, she wasn’t too proud to apologize.

Besides, he had delivered the food she’d just devoured.

Harrison clearly hadn’t expected an apology. A girl this upfront, admitting fault so easily—he couldn’t just ignore it. Still, he wasn’t used to this kind of directness, so he stiffly nodded. "I-It’s fine. No problem."

Isabella grinned, her smile bright and unapologetic.

Harrison quickly faced forward again, adjusting his grip on the wheel. Just then, Alexander opened the door and slid into the car. "Let’s go."

Evelyn turned to Isabella. "What’s your new address again? You said it’s close to the office, right?"

"Super close." Isabella rattled off an unfamiliar street name. Evelyn frowned. "Harrison, do you know that area? We’ll drop Bella off first before heading back."

"Got it." Harrison started the engine.

Isabella instinctively scooted closer to the window, pressing her forehead against the glass. She knew when to make herself scarce—third wheels shouldn’t overstay their welcome.

But Evelyn didn’t get the hint. Worried Isabella might feel awkward, she shifted closer and looped an arm through hers. "Bella, the next few days should be light. Rest up. After that, we’ll dive into the new product. I’ll run some ideas by you soon."

Isabella hummed in response, keeping her gaze fixed outside. Even without looking, she could feel Alexander’s presence—heavy, commanding, impossible to ignore.

"I’m thinking of shifting the target demographic," Evelyn mused. "What do you—"

"If you’re off the clock," Alexander’s deep voice cut in, "maybe stop talking business." With that, he tugged Evelyn toward him, effectively ending the conversation.
###Chapter 219

The car took a sharp turn, sending Evelyn tumbling straight into Alexander's arms. Isabella gasped, then quickly pretended to look away, gripping the door handle with one hand while covering her flushed face with the other.

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson. She tried to push Alexander away to sit up properly, but he seized the opportunity to wrap an arm around her waist, pulling her firmly against him. His grip left no room for argument.

"Is the new product a success?" Alexander asked, his voice calm but laced with quiet satisfaction.

The question instantly brightened Evelyn's expression. "Yes! It turned out exactly how I envisioned—no, even better than I expected. It's perfect!"

"That deserves a celebration," Alexander murmured, his fingers tracing idle circles on her side.

Evelyn nodded eagerly. "We should! Liv—" She turned toward Isabella, excitement sparkling in her eyes. "Let's pick a date. How about that Cantonese place you loved last time?"

Isabella opened her mouth to agree, but the air suddenly grew heavy. A chill prickled down her spine as she caught Alexander's icy glare in her peripheral vision. She swallowed hard and backtracked. "I—I mean, it's fine! Really, I don’t mind. Heh."

Being the third wheel was not easy.

"You don’t mind? You raved about that place for days," Evelyn pointed out, oblivious to the tension. "Oh, and we should invite Victoria too. She’s been working so hard lately."

Isabella forced a laugh, resting her cheek on her palm as she stared out the window. Even through the reflection, Alexander’s darkened expression was impossible to miss.

Sigh. Who knew Mr. Kensington would get jealous over me? I’m a woman, for heaven’s sake!

She shifted uncomfortably, wishing Harrison would drive faster.

From her angle, Harrison seemed entirely focused on the road, his jaw set with determination—though the dim lighting might have softened his usual sternness.

Evelyn frowned at Isabella’s lack of enthusiasm. "What’s wrong? You don’t seem excited."

"I think you’re excited enough for both of us," Alexander remarked, pulling Evelyn closer. He tilted her chin up, his voice dropping to a murmur. "Tell me, who else do you plan to celebrate with?"

"Who else? Well, Liv and I developed the product, and Victoria helped a lot, so obviously her. As for others..." Evelyn trailed off, finally noticing the warning glint in Alexander’s eyes.

"B-But—" She gave a nervous laugh. "You can’t!"

Alexander’s expression darkened instantly.

A slow, deliberate cough came from the driver’s seat. Isabella buried her face in her hands, pretending to yawn to stifle her laughter.

Realizing how her words sounded, Evelyn quickly corrected herself. "N-No! I just meant—it wouldn’t be appropriate for you to come. You know, public appearances and all."
###Chapter 220

Alexander Kensington's expression remained dark, his heart clearly wounded.

Evelyn Carter continued to soothe him, "Of course, my success is all because of you. You deserve the most credit."

She leaned closer, her voice warm. "You're the hidden force behind everything! Having your support is my greatest honor. I'm so proud of you!"

Alexander said nothing. Neither did Isabella Thornton. Harrison coughed lightly in the backseat.

If they hadn't been sharing the same car with Alexander, Isabella would have applauded Evelyn's masterful flattery.

Honestly, this was the first time she'd seen Evelyn act like this. It had never been like this with Dominic Reeves. Their conversations had been sparse, mostly work-related. Occasionally, Dominic would offer a compliment, but their interactions had never felt this effortless—this alive.

Isabella stole a glance at Alexander. His stormy expression had completely shifted. She could have sworn she saw the faintest blush on his cheeks.

Huh. Who knew he could be shy?

"Where did you learn to sweet-talk like that?" He reached out, pinching her cheek, his voice softening. "Even if the new product passes testing, it'll take time before the official launch. If you want to rest and celebrate, why not take a trip? It’ll help you unwind."

"A trip?" Evelyn blinked. The idea hadn't occurred to her. In the past, she'd just moved straight to the next project—sampling raw materials, testing formulas, refining scents. It had been a relentless cycle.

Her reasoning had been simple back then. She wanted to create as much as possible while her inspiration was fresh. Some attempts would fail, others would succeed. DR Holdings would grow, and Dominic could relax. Once they married, she imagined a quieter life—one where she could work at her own pace, free from the grind.

At the time, she’d truly believed they wanted the same things.

"Nothing’s decided yet," Alexander said smoothly. "If you have a destination in mind, let me know. I’ll arrange everything for you both."

Isabella perked up instantly. "Both of us?"

Alexander arched a brow. "You don’t want to go?"

Before he could finish, Isabella was nodding vigorously. "Yes! Absolutely! I definitely want to go!"

She couldn’t believe it. After years at DR Holdings, she’d never gotten perks like this. Even if she was just tagging along, she wasn’t about to refuse.

Earlier, she’d assumed Alexander disliked her. Now? She wasn’t so sure.

The car slowed to a stop. Alexander glanced out the window. "This is you."

"Oh! Right, home sweet home." Isabella grinned, far more relaxed than when she’d first stepped into the car. "Thank you, Mr. Kensington. Have a wonderful night!"

Evelyn frowned at the darkened street. "It’s too late. Let me walk you in."
###Chapter 221

Sophia was fully alert this time. She quickly shook her head in refusal. "That won't be necessary. I can handle it myself!"

Evelyn sighed.

Outside the car window, the night was thick, and this was clearly not the entrance to their residential area.

Across the street stretched a narrow alley, its dimly lit path looking anything but safe.

"Harrison, escort her home. Make sure she gets inside safely," Alexander commanded, as if sensing Sophia's hesitation. "Be quick about it and return immediately."

"Understood, sir," Harrison replied. He pulled the car to a stop, unbuckled his seatbelt, and stepped out before Sophia could protest further.

"No, really, it's fine—"

But Harrison was already rounding the car, opening her door with a polite gesture. "Miss Thornton, after you."

Realizing there was no point arguing, Sophia reluctantly stepped out. "T-Then I’ll be going. Evelyn, you and Mr. Kensington should get some rest."

"Alright," Evelyn nodded, watching as Sophia and Harrison disappeared into the shadows. Only then did she register the odd phrasing.

"Did Sophia just say you and Mr. Kensington should get some rest?" She turned to Alexander, who was staring at her with an unreadable expression.

A slow smirk curled her lips. "Don’t tell me you’re jealous?"

Alexander scoffed loudly. "Took you long enough to notice."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Seriously? She’s a girl."

"And?" His arms crossed. "Does that mean I can’t be jealous? You treat her like she’s some fragile treasure. What about me?"

His tone was so petulant that Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh. "It’s not the same!"

"Explain how." His eyes narrowed. "Unless, deep down, you think she matters more than I do?"

Jealous Alexander was a force to be reckoned with—like a child deprived of his favorite toy. Evelyn bit back a grin. "Well, she is important."

Before his expression could darken further, she looped her arms around his neck and pulled him down, pressing a quick kiss to his lips. "But you," she murmured against his mouth, "are the most important."

That single sentence was enough to dissolve his irritation. His hand cradled the back of her head as he deepened the kiss, pouring all his earlier frustration into it.

Meanwhile, Harrison paused after a few steps, allowing Sophia to catch up slightly before continuing forward. They maintained a careful distance—close enough for safety, but not so close as to intrude.

Sophia kept her gaze lowered, focusing on the faint outline of Harrison’s shadow ahead. It was a practical arrangement.

This was the same path she took every evening after work, always alone. The quiet alley, the occasional rustle of a stray cat in the trash—it had never been a comforting walk.

But tonight, for the first time, she wasn’t afraid.

Because tonight, she wasn’t alone.
###Chapter 222

Sophia’s new apartment was surprisingly close to the company, and the rent was unbelievably affordable. The only downside? That dimly lit alley she had to walk through every night. But she didn’t think much of it—until now.

She paused at the foot of the stairs and turned around. “I’m here. Thanks.”

Harrison halted, his hands shoved into his coat pockets. “No problem.”

Sophia scratched the back of her neck, forcing an awkward smile. “They’re probably waiting for me, so I won’t invite you up. Rain check for tea?”

“Don’t bother,” he muttered.

“Right. Well… goodbye.” She waved, unsure how to respond to his bluntness. When he didn’t move, she hesitated before climbing the steps. At the landing, she glanced down—he was still there, unmoving beneath the flickering streetlamp.

She waved again. “You can go now.”

“Yeah.”

But he didn’t.

With a quiet sigh, Sophia hurried inside, careful not to wake her mother. Once in her room, she flicked on the desk lamp and peered out the window.

Harrison stood exactly where she’d left him, his broad frame casting a long shadow. Only when her light clicked on did he finally tilt his head up, meeting her gaze for a brief second before turning away.

She watched as he disappeared into the alley, his silhouette shrinking until it was swallowed by the darkness. A strange warmth curled in her chest.

Lucien rolled onto his back, his face pale. He yanked the blanket over his head, exhaling sharply.

“Lucien.” Vanessa’s voice was soft, hesitant. “I can’t come over for the next few days. The new product launch is almost done, and I can’t slip away. Plus, Dominic won’t be as busy anymore. I’m worried—”

“Why are you so scared of him?” Lucien sat up abruptly, the sheet pooling around his waist. He didn’t bother covering himself, just draped a towel loosely over his lap.

Vanessa didn’t need to look to know he’d lost more weight. They’d been meeting like this for months—she knew every inch of him. And right now, he looked brittle.

Once, he’d been sharp, dangerous. Now? She wasn’t sure how much longer she could rely on him.

“It’s not fear,” she corrected, sitting up. “It’s strategy. I don’t want to risk anything.”

Lucien scoffed, moving to the couch. He pulled out a small pouch and dumped its contents onto the table. “We both know what this is. You get what you need from me. So why can’t I have what I want?”

“You think I’m marrying him?” His mocking laugh made her stiffen.

“For now, he’s the best option,” she said flatly. “Just like I’m yours.”

Lucien smirked but didn’t deny it. He leaned forward, rolling a thin paper between his fingers before bringing it to his nose. His breath hitched.

Vanessa turned away, disgusted. She slid out of bed and headed for the bathroom—then froze.

A single drop of blood stained the tiles beneath her.
###Chapter 223

Vanessa's breath hitched as panic surged through her. She had been uncertain about keeping the baby, but she never imagined it might leave her on its own. The choice had always been hers—until now.

The sound of movement outside snapped her back to reality. She shoved the thought aside and turned on the shower faucet, scrubbing away the bloodstains on the floor before rinsing herself clean. A quick glance confirmed no traces remained. Relief flickered through her, but it was short-lived.

She couldn’t stay here.

Drying off hastily, she dressed and bolted for the door, desperate to escape the suffocating room.

Lucien’s voice cut through the air before she could turn the knob. "Did I say you could leave?"

Vanessa forced a tight smile. "I’m sorry, Lucien. Something urgent came up."

He rose from the bed, his steps unsteady as he closed the distance between them. One hand slammed against the door, trapping her. "And what about your promise?"

She blinked, scrambling to recall. "I haven’t forgotten. I just need the right opportunity. I’ll handle it—I gave you my word."

His smile was razor-thin. "Opportunities don’t wait. Neither do I." His fingers traced her jaw, lingering near her lips. "You know what happens if you disappoint me."

Her pulse spiked.

Lucien was unpredictable on a good day, but under the influence? A nightmare. She needed to leave—now.

Swallowing her fear, she forced a laugh. "Of course I know. And I also know you’ll reward me if I make you happy. Just give me a little more time."

She eased his arm down, and to her surprise, he let her. His smirk deepened. "No tricks, Vanessa. Be good."

His kiss was rough, possessive. She stiffened but nodded when he pulled back. "I will. So—I should go."

This time, he didn’t stop her.

The moment the hotel doors closed behind her, she exhaled sharply. But even on the street, her guard stayed up.

Lucien was too dangerous. She needed a new ally.

And more urgently—

One hand pressed to her stomach, the other hailed a cab. "Take me to Mercy General. Now."

The doctor studied her test results, his expression unreadable. "Do you want to keep this pregnancy?"

Vanessa’s lips pressed into a thin line.

Silence stretched between them.
###Chapter 224

The sterile white walls of the examination room seemed to close in as the doctor's words hung heavily in the air.

"If you wish to keep this pregnancy, intimacy must cease immediately. I strongly advise hospitalization to prevent miscarriage." The doctor adjusted his glasses, his tone clinical. "If termination is your choice, I recommend scheduling the procedure without delay. Prolonging this will only worsen your condition."

Vanessa's fingers tightened around the edge of the examination table. "Is intimacy truly that dangerous?"

Her mind raced. Refusing Dominic was one thing, but Lucien Dubois? She could reject him once, maybe twice, but indefinitely? Impossible.

The thought of spending the next ten months bedridden, sacrificing her ambitions for a child, made her stomach churn. She had worked too hard to let this derail her. The year-end competition was within reach—victory would skyrocket her career. With Lucien's influence and the judges' favor, her future would be unstoppable.

But this...

A life confined to a hospital bed, her body no longer her own?

The mere idea terrified her.

"You're already showing signs of miscarriage. Isn't that serious enough?" The doctor's voice sharpened, his disapproval evident. "Young women today disregard their health. The first trimester is fragile—intimacy should be avoided entirely, or at the very least, approached with extreme caution."

Heat flooded Vanessa's cheeks. Even from a medical professional, the bluntness stung.

She swallowed hard. "If I choose termination, how long would the procedure take? Would I need to stay overnight?"

The doctor's lips thinned. "Is this really about intimacy?"

She bristled. "No. It's complicated."

Her nails dug into her palms. "I’ve heard medication can induce abortion. Is that an option? Could I leave the same day? What about pain management? Recovery time?"

His expression darkened. "Medication is no longer viable for your condition. Surgical termination would require a two-day wait. Discharge depends on your recovery, but make no mistake—all procedures carry risks. This will damage your body."

He leaned forward, his gaze piercing. "Uterine scarring could impact future pregnancies. Are you absolutely certain?"

Vanessa's hand drifted to her abdomen. A dull ache pulsed beneath her fingertips. No bump yet, no flutter of movement—just the silent presence of something she hadn’t asked for.

But the cost of keeping it was too high.

"Take time to reconsider," the doctor urged. "Discuss this with the father. This isn’t a decision to make lightly."

The father.

Dominic's face flashed in her mind.

Her jaw set. "No. I want the procedure. Schedule it."
###Chapter 225

Vanessa had expected to wait for the doctor to schedule her surgery. Instead, he handed her a prescription.

She frowned at the slip of paper. "I thought you said medication wasn’t an option. Why prescribe it now?"

"You have inflammation that needs treatment before we proceed with surgery."

The doctor hesitated, then added sternly, "You must abstain from intimacy for a while. Your condition is severe. If left unchecked, it could damage your uterus."

He continued listing precautions, but Vanessa tuned him out. She knew her health wasn’t perfect, but this was worse than she’d imagined. Shame burned through her at the doctor’s knowing look. At least he hadn’t recognized her.

Back home, she swallowed the pills with a gulp of water and tucked the prescription deep into her bag. Relieved that Dominic had been too busy to notice her absence, she collapsed onto the bed.

Her thoughts drifted to Lucien, and her stomach twisted. She rolled onto her side, restless. This had to end—soon. The only solution was to push Evelyn into Lucien’s arms. But how? It had to be untraceable.

The bedroom door creaked open. Dominic was home.

Vanessa feigned sleep, keeping her breathing steady.

He crossed the room and sat beside her. Even with her eyes closed, she felt the blanket shift as he tucked it around her shoulders. A soft sigh escaped him.

"Vanessa… Vanessa…" His voice was quiet, hesitant.

She remained still, but he persisted. "Are you asleep?"

No choice. She stirred, rubbing her eyes. "You’re back."

"Yeah."

Dominic leaned down, brushing a kiss against her cheek. "Did I wake you? Sorry. You’ve been working hard."

"It’s fine. I wasn’t sleeping well anyway." She studied his face—the exhaustion, the tension. "What’s wrong? You seem upset."

He forced a smile. "About the perfume formula… Do you think it needs adjustments?"

His tone was cautious, as if afraid to offend her.

Vanessa stiffened. "The formula? What’s wrong with it? You approved it before."
###Chapter 226

"The sample was technically successful, but our product failed the final testing phase. The outcome was... unacceptable for market competition." Dominic decided honesty was best with Vanessa. Some truths couldn't be sugarcoated.

"Unacceptable? That's impossible!" Her fingers tightened around the formula sheet. "This blueprint can't be wrong. I obtained it from—" She caught herself mid-sentence, biting her lip.

Dominic's gaze sharpened. "From where?"

"From—from my archives. I've had this formula for years, tested it countless times. There's no possible error!" Though her voice held conviction, doubt flickered in her eyes.

Lucien had provided this formula. Vanessa never questioned his expertise—until now. The failed tests shook her confidence, but she couldn't let Dominic suspect anything. She lifted her chin defiantly.

"I agree the formula should be flawless," Dominic ran a hand through his hair, "but we've replicated the process multiple times. Perhaps we should—" He hesitated, struggling with his next words.

Just days ago, he'd forbidden her from entering Phoenix Labs. Now he needed her expertise there. The irony tasted bitter, especially making this request to his fiancée. The words stuck in his throat.

"You want me to inspect the lab?" Vanessa finished for him. After years together, she could read his silences perfectly.

Dominic exhaled sharply, shaking his head. "No, forget it. We have top chemists who can troubleshoot. I only wanted to verify the formula. We'll break through this obstacle."

"Dom, stop pretending." She captured his restless hands. "You said it yourself—this is the crucial phase. As the formula's creator, I should oversee its execution. Even without your request, I'd insist on going."

"It's the chemical exposure I'm worried about." His gaze dropped to her abdomen. "Given your... condition."

Vanessa had been avoiding intimacy lately, citing the baby's delicate state. She needed space to focus on the pregnancy, she'd claimed. Dominic had respected her wishes, channeling his frustration into preparing for fatherhood. Every precaution mattered now.

She laughed, pulling a surgical mask from her pocket. "Relax, I'll wear full protection." Her eyes twinkled as she teased, "Should I borrow a hazmat suit from the fire department?"

"I'll have one specially tailored," he deadpanned.

Vanessa collapsed onto the bed laughing. "You're ridiculous! I'm joking! A quick inspection won't harm the baby. Our child isn't made of glass, you know." She patted her stomach playfully.

"But—"

"No more arguments," she cut him off, feigning annoyance. "Unless you want to deal with a very cranky pregnant woman?"

"...Fine." Dominic surrendered reluctantly.
###Chapter 227

Vanessa hadn't figured out how to tell Dominic about the abortion, even though she had already made up her mind—she didn’t want the baby. The issue with the form had come at the perfect time. It gave her the perfect cover to stage the abortion as a miscarriage, making Dominic feel guilty instead of suspicious.

But first, she needed to meet Lucien. She chose a public café, feeling safer that way. When he arrived, he looked worse than usual—dark circles under his eyes, his skin sallow. He always had that half-dead look about him, but she didn’t care. He was just a tool to her, disposable once she got what she needed.

"Didn’t you say you were busy?" He dumped sugar cubes into his coffee, stopping at six before stirring lazily.

"Miss me already?" Lucien smirked before taking a long sip, exhaling dramatically.

Vanessa waited, her gaze sharp. "Was there anything wrong with the form you gave me?" Her voice was soft, but her eyes burned into his.

"Form? What form?" He blinked, feigning ignorance until he noticed her chewing her lip. Then it clicked. "Oh, that thing I gave you last time? Just something I came up with on the spot. Never tested it. How would I know if it works?"

His casual tone made her blood boil. "You don’t know?"

"You handed me something untested? Were you trying to sabotage me?" She barely kept her voice down, fingers tightening around her cup. "You knew I needed it for the annual perfume contest. After everything I’ve done for you, this is how you repay me?"

"Tsk, tsk. So dramatic." He clicked his tongue, amused. "It’s just some local competition. Why the fuss?"

Vanessa clenched her jaw. To him, it was nothing. To her, it was everything. She had won before using Evelyn’s formulas, but as a rookie perfumer from a small company like DR Holdings, she couldn’t compete in bigger categories. This was her chance to break into the elite circles, to finally escape Lucien’s grip.

But she couldn’t say that. Not yet.

"I don’t care. Fix it. I need to start my perfume now. I will win this." Her voice was steel, her gaze drifting to the window, where the sunlight glinted off the city skyline.

"Fine, fine. Let’s go to your lab." He shrugged, far too easily.

That surprised her. But then came the problem—if Dominic saw Lucien at the lab, it would raise questions. And Dominic hated Lucien, convinced he had ulterior motives.

This was going to be tricky.
###Chapter 228

"No! There are too many people at the lab, and they'll spot you. Even if the perfume is a success and I use it to enter the competition, the organizing committee might use our connection as an excuse to disqualify me," Vanessa said, her brow furrowing in frustration.

She groaned, pressing her fingers to her temples. "Can't you just analyze the samples without coming into the lab? Why don't I bring the failed batches for you to examine?"

Lucien gave a slow nod. "I can do that. But the results might not be ideal. Either I'll pinpoint the issue immediately, or this could drag on for ages—maybe ten more attempts."

It felt like an endless loop. If Vanessa refused Lucien's offer to accompany her to the lab, he might never solve the problem. The perfume would fail, and she'd lose her chance at the competition.

But if she let him into the lab without considering Dominic's reaction, the organizers could accuse her of cheating. The thought made her stomach twist. She exhaled sharply, rubbing her temples.

Lucien studied her for a moment before speaking. "I have an idea. It's risky, though. Depends on whether you're willing to take the chance."

"What is it?" she demanded, desperate for any solution.

"If I recall correctly, you're in charge of the lab, aren't you?" he asked.

Even though she rarely showed up, she was still the director. Vanessa lifted her chin. "Of course. I am the research director."

A slow, knowing smile curved his lips. "Then you decide when we go in."

Her eyes widened. "You mean—"

"Too many people during the day. But at night?" His grin turned wicked. "No one would know."

The knot in her chest loosened. The lab emptied after hours. With her access, sneaking him in wouldn’t be an issue. They could fix the formula, and Lucien could even start production. With his expertise, she’d have a flawless entry. No more worrying about disqualification.

But when her gaze met his, her pulse stuttered. Being alone with him… that was another risk entirely.

"I'm just offering suggestions. The decision is yours." He stretched lazily, arms behind his head. "Though if you want my help, you’d better decide soon."

Vanessa clenched her fists, weighing the consequences. Finally, she gave a sharp nod. "Fine. Tonight. I’ll take you to the lab. But this perfume has to work."
###Chapter 229

Evelyn slept like the dead. Not because her day at Phoenix Labs had been particularly exhausting, but because...

She'd been conducting personal experiments in a rather intimate field of study. Her findings confirmed what she'd suspected - men and women had fundamentally different endurance thresholds in certain activities. Case in point: Alexander had risen at dawn, fresh as morning dew, to attend some corporate meeting at DR Holdings.

She wasn't even certain what ungodly hour he'd slipped away. The last hazy memory was of his lips brushing her forehead in a featherlight goodbye kiss. Everything before that existed in a delicious, sleep-addled blur.

Her fingers fumbled across the nightstand until they closed around her buzzing phone. She dragged it to her ear. "Mmm?"

"Evelyn! It's me." Isabella's voice chirped through the receiver, annoyingly alert.

"Christ, it's too early for this energy," Evelyn groaned, rolling onto her stomach. Every muscle protested the movement. "Don't you ever sleep?"

"Early?" A disbelieving laugh. "Sweetheart, it's nearly six. In the evening."

"Six isn't..." Evelyn's sleep-fogged brain short-circuited. Her thumb hovered over the end call button.

"Evelyn Carter, tell me you don't actually think it's six AM right now."

"Six PM isn't... Wait, what?!" Awareness crashed over her like icy water. "Six PM?!"

She yanked the phone away to stare at the screen. The numbers 5:47 PM glared back mockingly.

Two heartbeats of stunned silence. Then she launched from bed, bare feet slapping against cold hardwood as she sprinted to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The curtains flew open to reveal a sky painted in sunset hues, the dying light laughing at her lost day.

"Holy shit. Did I really sleep around the clock?"

"Let me guess - you've been unconscious since last night?" Isabella's question was rhetorical. The evidence spoke for itself.

Evelyn collapsed into the window seat, fingers tangling in her wild bedhead. Despite the late hour, exhaustion still clung to her bones. The crimson horizon blurred as she exhaled slowly. "Does it matter? It's not like we're punching timecards today."

"That's not the point. You promised Victoria you'd meet for celebratory drinks yesterday. Or have you forgotten?" Isabella's tone carried a gentle warning.

The memory surfaced through the mental fog. "We can reschedule. I'll check her calendar." While Phoenix Labs was on hiatus, allowing Evelyn and Isabella some downtime, Victoria bore the weight of an entire department. Their plans would have to accommodate her.

"Perfect. Just let me know when. My schedule's wide open." The excitement in Isabella's voice was palpable. This would mark their first proper celebration since her career transition - a milestone worth commemorating.

"I'm hanging up now." Evelyn moved to end the call when Isabella's hurried "Wait-" stopped her.

"What now?" Evelyn pressed the phone back to her ear with a sigh.

"So... about that company retreat Dominic mentioned..." Hesitation colored Isabella's words, but beneath it thrummed barely-contained anticipation. "Did Alexander happen to mention where we're going?"

"Not a clue."

Evelyn pushed upright, padding toward the ensuite bathroom with the phone wedged between shoulder and ear. She grabbed her toothbrush, squeezing a generous ribbon of toothpaste onto the bristles. The minty foam filled her mouth just as Isabella's shocked voice came through:

"What? You mean you two didn't discuss it last night after you got home? I assumed..."
###Chapter 230

Evelyn Carter couldn't stop replaying last night's events in her mind. What had happened between her and Alexander Kensington was definitely not PG-rated.

Discuss? What was there to discuss? She wasn't in the right headspace for that kind of conversation. Where would they even find the time—or the privacy?

She studied her reflection in the mirror, wincing at the faint marks along her collarbone. Every muscle in her body ached as if she'd been dismantled and reassembled. The word "exhausted" might as well have been stamped across her forehead.

"Evelyn? Evelyn, are you still there?" Silence stretched on the line, making Sophia Grant wonder if the call had dropped. "Mm, I'm here," Evelyn finally mumbled, spitting out toothpaste foam.

"I don't have much to say," Sophia admitted. "I just wanted to know if you've decided where we're going tonight. I know it's not my place to ask, but I'm dying for a night out." Between lab work and budgeting, she hadn't had real fun in months. This was her chance.

Evelyn rubbed her temples, phone tucked against her shoulder as she stepped out of the bathroom. "Of course it's your place. You're coming with us—you get a say. We haven't picked a spot yet. Got any ideas?"

"Wait, seriously?" Sophia's voice shot up in excitement. Not only was she invited, but she could actually choose? "Since when do I lie to you?" Evelyn pressed a hand to her growling stomach. Hunger had a way of sharpening the senses the moment you woke up.

"Hold on, Sophia. Let me call Victoria first. How about we celebrate now?"

"Now?" Sophia sputtered.

Evelyn was nothing if not impulsive. "You busy?"

"No! I'm free. At home." Sophia backtracked quickly. "Perfect. I'll call her and text you."

Victoria Sterling was easy to convince—as long as she wasn't buried in paperwork, she was game. She agreed instantly, with one firm condition: No fighting me for the bill.

Evelyn didn't argue. She'd find a way to pay first anyway. After throwing on fresh clothes, she headed to The Canopy. Sophia had already arrived, but Victoria was running late, stuck wrapping things up at DR Holdings.

The delay gave Evelyn time to warn Sophia. "Victoria doesn't know about this," she said, gesturing vaguely at herself. "Don't spill."

"Know what?" Sophia blinked innocently. Then, under Evelyn's pointed stare, it clicked. "Oh. That. She doesn't know?"

Evelyn shook her head. "She knows I'm seeing someone. Just not who. I wasn't planning to tell anyone." When Sophia's grin turned smug, she added, "If I hadn't run into you yesterday, nobody would know."

Sophia's smile vanished into a pout. "Hmph. And here I thought I was special."

"You are special," Evelyn said, tapping her shoulder. "You're the only one who knows. So keep it that way."

That perked Sophia right up. "A secret!" she whispered gleefully. This was their thing—just the two of them. She could already picture Dominic Reeves' face when he found out. Oh, she lived for that future moment.
###Chapter 231

"Cheers!" The cozy room buzzed with energy, even though only three of them were gathered. Their excitement was palpable.

"I never imagined you could develop a fragrance this quickly. I'm absolutely blown away!" Victoria exclaimed.

She had already tested the successful samples that morning. The girls had given her a sample to try yesterday, and the scent was intoxicating—truly exquisite. "We told you the formula was a winner. Honestly, this is just the beginning. Evelyn could craft an entirely new fragrance and perfect it within a month!" Sophia boasted between bites.

"Seriously? A month? That means she could create dozens of new perfumes in a year!" Just imagining the sheer volume of products Evelyn could produce sent a thrill through Victoria. And given what she had already witnessed, she had no doubts about the quality.

"Well, not exactly. Without inspiration or a clear vision, it could take me three months or more to perfect something worthwhile. Let’s hope you don’t get impatient and fire me!" Evelyn turned to Victoria with a playful smirk.

Victoria burst into laughter. "As if I’d ever have that power! Remember when you first joined Phoenix Labs..." She paused, glancing at Sophia. "You weren’t here yet, so you wouldn’t know. When Evelyn first arrived, I fought tooth and nail to keep her off my team. I even argued with Mr. Preston—but it didn’t change a thing! I was convinced she had some high-up connection in the company. Absolutely certain!"

Victoria slammed her palm on the table for emphasis. Sophia shot Evelyn an amused look, thinking, Well, she’s not entirely wrong. Evelyn does have a connection—just not the kind she’s imagining.

Sophia grinned mischievously and nudged Victoria. "So, who was Evelyn’s mysterious backer?"

Victoria turned to Evelyn and pouted dramatically. "Turns out, she didn’t have one at all! Since I couldn’t get rid of her, I decided to drown her in impossible tasks, hoping she’d quit. But she proved me wrong—every single time."

She leaned in, her voice softening. "That’s when I realized her talent alone would keep her here, connections or not. She’s a prodigy. Honestly, I’m not worried about you leaving. I know you’ll become a legend in this industry one day."

The praise was effusive, but Evelyn simply smiled. "You’re too kind."

"I mean it! Just don’t forget about us when you’re famous, alright?" Victoria downed another glass, her words starting to slur.

"Victoria, I think you’ve had enough," Sophia said, steadying her as she swayed slightly.

"Enough? Please, I can handle way more than this! You should see me on business trips—" She cut herself off, clapping a hand over her mouth as her face paled.

"Victoria, are you okay? Maybe we should call it a night," Sophia suggested, eyeing her with concern.

"Leave? It’s way too early! Besides, when do we ever get time like this to just talk?" Victoria grabbed both their hands, pulling them closer. "I really like you two. Everyone at the office is terrified of me. To them, I’m just some work-obsessed monster. But that’s not who I am. This industry is brutal—if you’re not tough, you’ll get crushed."

Her grip tightened, her voice raw with sincerity. "But with you... it’s different."
###Chapter 232

Victoria had so much to unload. It felt like she'd been searching for the perfect moment to release all the emotions she'd bottled up. "Honestly, our department isn't the worst. Sure, the pressure can be crushing, but at least we can always chase new clients and deals. Perfumers? That's a whole different beast."

She shook her head, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Evelyn's skills... they're unreal. And I'm not just talking about within Phoenix Labs. Look at our entire country—finding someone as brilliant as her is nearly impossible, let alone someone with global recognition. Phoenix has never lacked perfumers, but true talent? That's rare. Evelyn, when I look at you, I see potential. Real potential."

Victoria reached out, giving Evelyn's shoulder a firm pat that nearly knocked her off balance.

After listening quietly to Victoria's heartfelt words, Evelyn finally spoke. "We'll win the annual fragrance competition."

The declaration hit Victoria like a splash of ice water. Her eyes widened, and she sat up straighter, suddenly sober. Sophia, too, stared at Evelyn in shock. In all their time working together, she had never seen Evelyn exude such confidence. Evelyn was always buried in her research, tweaking formulas, refining scents—never boastful, never making bold claims. But now? It was as if victory was already hers.

"Evelyn, just making the top three would be incredible," Victoria said, trying to temper expectations. Winning the whole thing? That was beyond imagination. The industry was ruthless, filled with seasoned perfumers and hidden prodigies. Who knew if there was another Evelyn out there, or someone even better?

She worried she'd accidentally pressured Evelyn and quickly backtracked. "You don’t have to aim for first place. You’re still new to Phoenix. There’s no need to—"

"Trust me," Evelyn interrupted softly, squeezing Victoria’s hand before standing. "I’ll be right back."

As Evelyn walked out, Victoria and Sophia exchanged stunned glances.

"Was she always this... self-assured?" Victoria whispered.

Evelyn had never cared about accolades. She never bragged about her work, never obsessed over competitions or awards—not even whether her perfumes made it to production. To her, Dominic handled that side of things, and she trusted him completely.

Once, she'd even admitted she worried her fragrances might have flaws. Despite countless tests, she could never be fully certain.

Sophia suspected this hesitation stemmed from the backlash Evelyn faced after her first competition. It had shaken her. But after leaving Dominic and DR Holdings, something changed. She was different now—bolder, more determined.

Just like the name of her new company, she had truly risen from the ashes.
###Chapter 233

The hallway lights flickered as Evelyn made her way to the restroom. Passing several closed doors, she nearly jumped when one suddenly swung open. A familiar silhouette emerged, and though the encounter lasted mere seconds, recognition flashed in her eyes.

She continued walking, the encounter replaying in her mind. After washing her hands thoroughly, she stepped out to find Donovan Pierce leaning against the opposite wall, arms crossed.

"I knew it was you," Donovan said, pushing off the wall with deliberate slowness.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Your observational skills remain impeccable. Now if you'll excuse me..."

He blocked her path effortlessly. "What are you doing here?"

"The same as you, I imagine," she countered, tilting her head. "Unless this hotel suddenly became Hawthorne property? Am I trespassing?"

"You still refuse to return to the family?" Donovan's frown deepened at her mocking tone.

"The Hawthornes?" Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "I'll go back when the time is right."

"And when might that be?" he pressed.

When she remained silent, his voice turned icy. "I heard about your little incident. Sloppy work, though thankfully it didn't reflect poorly on us. Since you insist on staying away, remember this - you still carry our name. Don't embarrass us."

"Don't worry," Evelyn met his gaze steadily, "I have no connection to the Hawthornes whatsoever." She brushed past him without looking back, throwing a careless wave over her shoulder.

Donovan watched her retreating figure, eyes narrowing dangerously.

Back at the table, neither Victoria nor Isabella expected Evelyn to be the one who'd overindulged. Returning from the restroom, Evelyn ordered three more beers and two bottles of Cabernet, even attempting to add champagne before her friends intervened.

According to Evelyn, this marked Phoenix Labs' first major breakthrough since her arrival - an achievement worth celebrating. What began as a toast escalated into multiple bottles, leaving Evelyn thoroughly inebriated by closing time.

Victoria gently shook Evelyn's shoulder. "Where do you live? We need to get you home."

She needed the address to arrange a cab, though given Evelyn's state, simply sending her off wouldn't suffice. Someone needed to ensure she arrived safely. "I-I'm at C-Crestview..." Evelyn's slurred words were unintelligible.

Victoria frowned at Isabella. "What did she say?"

Isabella leaned closer. "Say that again?"

"Crestview Heights." The words came out clearly this time, prompting stunned silence.

"Crestview Heights?" Victoria's voice rose an octave. "Do you realize what that is? How could you possibly live there? Are you secretly loaded? This is terrifying."

Isabella acted quickly, recognizing the address as Alexander Kensington's. The exclusive neighborhood housed society's elite - its properties beyond reach for ordinary professionals.

Since Victoria didn't know about Evelyn's relationship, Isabella intervened. "I know where she lives. Let me take her home - it's late and you have that early meeting tomorrow."

She steadied Evelyn while discreetly texting Alexander, knowing the situation required delicate handling. The night had taken an unexpected turn, revealing complications Isabella hadn't anticipated.
###Chapter 234

"Evelyn just said she lives in—" Victoria still hadn't recovered from her shock.

"I know, but she was talking about Magnolia Grove, just a few blocks from Crestview Heights," Sophia replied quickly. "Honestly, Evelyn once joked about wanting a place in Crestview Heights. No surprise she's bringing it up again—she's completely wasted now."

"I nearly had a heart attack!" Victoria exhaled in relief, finally accepting Sophia's explanation.

"Same here! Just wait till she sobers up tomorrow. I’ll never let her forget this," Sophia teased.

Victoria hesitated, then shook her head. "Actually, I should come with you. I’m still worried about you two."

She flagged down a cab and opened the door for them, about to climb in herself.

After making sure Evelyn was settled, Sophia rushed over to stop her. "It's fine. I’ll get her home safe. If you come, it’ll just be more complicated. You have work tomorrow—go rest. I’ll text you when we get to her place."

"But..." Victoria wavered, but she knew Sophia was right. Reluctantly, she nodded.

"Okay, but be careful! Text me if you need anything," she insisted, scribbling down the cab’s license plate number.

As the car pulled away, Sophia finally let out a breath. She glanced at Evelyn, stunned by her state. They’d worked together for years, but she’d never seen her like this. It was unsettling.

The cab reached Crestview Heights but was stopped at the gates. Sophia didn’t know which building Evelyn lived in, nor did she have Alexander Kensington’s number. Her only option was to wake Evelyn up.

"Evelyn, wake up. We’re here! Which building is yours?" She gently patted her cheek.

"Ugh... Quiet!" Evelyn groaned, cracking her eyes open for a second before shutting them again.

Sophia sighed. She thought about checking Evelyn’s phone, but the driver impatiently urged them out before she could.

With Evelyn half-slumped against her, Sophia struggled to keep her upright while fishing for the phone.

"Evelyn, come on. You can sleep once we’re inside!" she pleaded, still trying to rouse her.

Just then, a sleek black car pulled up beside them.

Sophia instinctively stepped in front of Evelyn, moving them both back. The window rolled down, revealing Alexander Kensington’s sharp, disapproving gaze.

"What’s going on?" His voice was ice.

Relief washed over Sophia. "Mr. Kensington! We were celebrating, but Evelyn had too much to drink."

She swallowed hard under his piercing stare, silently willing Evelyn to wake up and save her from this.

"Get in," he ordered, stepping out and effortlessly taking Evelyn from her arms.

Sophia’s shoulders sagged in relief. "Um, since she’s with you, I’ll just—"

"You’re staying. It’s impossible to get a cab here," he cut her off.

Sophia blinked in surprise. "I—I can walk to the main road—"

"Harrison will drive you home." His tone left no room for argument.

She could only nod.
###Chapter 235

The grandeur of wealth hit Evelyn like a tidal wave. From the moment she stepped through the gates, the imposing security guards made her pulse quicken. The sprawling gardens, the meticulously trimmed hedges, the architectural masterpiece of a house—every detail screamed luxury. And the fleet of high-end cars parked in the driveway? Just another reminder of Alexander Kensington’s staggering fortune.

Harrison swung the front door open as Alexander carried Evelyn in his arms, effortlessly, as if she weighed nothing. Despite his lean frame, his strength was undeniable. Evelyn, blissfully unaware in her drunken state, curled against him like a contented kitten. Isabella hesitated on the porch, then hurried inside after them.

Inside, Alexander settled Evelyn onto the plush sofa with care. Isabella hovered, unsure of her place. She wanted to fetch water, but the sheer size of the mansion left her clueless. A blanket? She didn’t even know where to begin.

Alexander had already taken charge, his attention solely on Evelyn. Isabella felt like an intruder in this intimate moment. She considered slipping away, but Alexander’s earlier warning kept her rooted in place. Awkwardly, she stood to the side, twisting her fingers.

Finally, she gathered the courage to speak. "Mr. Kensington, should I—?"

Alexander barely spared her a glance. "Harrison, see her home."

"I—I can manage on my own!" She shot a nervous look at the silent Harrison and waved her hands in polite refusal. Harrison merely shrugged. "Suit yourself."

The exchange between the two men left no room for her input. Resigned, she swallowed her protest. It was safer this way—hailing a cab in this upscale neighborhood at night was nearly impossible.

"Then I’ll take my leave," she murmured, glancing at Evelyn, whose cheeks were flushed. "She drank too much. Some hangover remedies might help when she wakes."

Alexander gave a curt nod, his gaze never leaving Evelyn. He didn’t even acknowledge her departure as Harrison escorted her out.

Meanwhile, Evelyn stirred, licking her dry lips with a whine. "Mmm… thirsty."

Alexander exhaled sharply, torn between irritation and amusement. He considered giving her a light smack for her recklessness, but the way she pouted—like a petulant child—softened his resolve.

"I’m dying of thirst," she groaned, flopping back dramatically.

Rolling his eyes, he fetched a glass of lukewarm water—knowing her delicate stomach couldn’t handle anything too cold. He propped her up gently, guiding the glass to her lips. She gulped it down greedily before collapsing back onto the cushions with a grimace.

"Ugh, that tasted awful!"

"Evelyn, don’t push your luck," he warned, setting the glass down with a clink. His eyebrow twitched in exasperation.

Dazed, she blinked up at him, her vision swimming. "A-Alex?"

"Hmm?"

Her voice was a sleepy whisper. "What took you so long?"

Before he could answer, she wobbled upright, swaying dangerously. His arms shot out to steady her, pulling her back down beside him.

And then—she hugged him. Tight.

All his irritation evaporated in an instant.

"I missed you," she mumbled into his chest.

He swallowed hard, his grip tightening around her.

Damn it. She always knew how to disarm him.
###Chapter 236

Dominic lifted his hand and gently stroked Evelyn’s back, his voice laced with concern. “If you can’t handle alcohol, you shouldn’t have drunk so much. Do you know how dangerous it is to get drunk alone?”

He was relieved she had made it home safely and that he’d returned just in time to let her in. The thought of her being stranded outside sent a chill down his spine.

Evelyn blinked up at him, her lips curving into a tipsy grin. “I didn’t drink that much!” She waved a hand in front of his face, her movements sluggish. “Just… one, two, three…” She frowned, counting on her fingers. “Five glasses! That’s nothing! You should’ve seen Victoria—she was wasted after the first five minutes!”

Dominic sighed. Even in this state, she still had the audacity to tease others.

“No more drinking without me,” he ordered, his tone firm. If he didn’t set boundaries now, she’d push her limits again.

Evelyn’s eyes sparkled mischievously. “Does that mean I can drink as much as I want when you’re around?” She leaned in, her breath warm against his skin. “We never had our wedding toast. Let’s do it now!”

Her cheeks were flushed, her lips slightly parted, and her gaze held a playful challenge. Despite the alcohol on her breath, Dominic found her intoxicating. That smile—soft, teasing, utterly irresistible—made his pulse quicken.

“Fine,” he conceded. “But not tonight.”

“Why not?” she pouted, shoving his arm lightly.

“Because I’m not drinking with someone who’s already drunk,” he said, amused. “We’ll do it when you’re sober.”

“But I’m not drunk!” she protested, crossing her arms.

Dominic arched a brow. “Sure, you’re not.” He exhaled, running a hand through his hair. “It’s late. Let’s get you to bed.”

Arguing with a drunk Evelyn was pointless. He’d save the lecture for tomorrow.

He draped a thin blanket over her as she curled up on the couch. Just as he stood, her fingers wrapped around his wrist.

“Don’t leave,” she mumbled.

“I’m just getting water,” he said gently.

“No.” Her grip tightened. “Stay.”

Dominic hesitated, then sighed. “Alright.” He sat back down, and Evelyn immediately nestled her cheek into his palm.

“Don’t lie to me,” she murmured.

He stayed there, listening to her steady breathing, her warmth seeping into his skin. The sensation was oddly comforting—and dangerously tempting.

But Evelyn, blissfully unaware, had already drifted off.

Dominic tried to pull his hand free, but she clung to him even in sleep. He chuckled under his breath. Stubborn even when unconscious.

Carefully, he shifted her onto the couch, replacing his hand with a small throw pillow. She grasped it instantly, her fingers curling into the fabric.

Finally free, Dominic stretched, his limbs stiff from sitting too long. He poured himself a glass of water, his gaze lingering on Evelyn’s sleeping form.

Then he remembered Sophia’s advice.

Hangover meds.

He’d make sure she had them ready for the morning.
###Chapter 237

A dull throbbing pulsed through Evelyn's temples as consciousness returned. Blinking against the morning light, she took in the familiar contours of her bedroom, yet something felt... off. The silk sheets tangled around her legs carried a faint trace of jasmine, too sweet for her usual perfume.

"Did I..." Her fingers pressed against her forehead as fragmented memories surfaced - laughter over champagne flutes at The Canopy with Sophia and Victoria, the clink of crystal glasses... then nothing. Just hazy impressions like smoke slipping through her fingers.

The moment her bare feet touched the cold hardwood, the room tilted violently. Evelyn gripped the nightstand, knuckles whitening as she fought the wave of nausea. Only when she collapsed back onto the mattress did the spinning subside.

"You're finally awake." Alexander's voice cut through the fog like a blade. He stood framed in the doorway, a steaming mug in hand, watching her with the wary caution one might show a sleeping panther.

"Did you... bring me home?" Evelyn winced at the rasp in her own voice.

"Your assistant did the heavy lifting." He took a deliberate sip of coffee, the steam curling around his sharp features. "I merely intercepted you at Magnolia Grove's gates before you could serenade the security cameras."

A flush crept up Evelyn's neck. She vaguely recalled attempting an off-key rendition of some pop song. "I... apologize for the inconvenience."

"Inconvenience?" Alexander set the mug down with a sharp click. "You called the concierge 'my liege' and tried to knight him with a dessert spoon." His footsteps were measured as he crossed the room. "Now, about my compensation..."

Before she could react, his hands caged her against the headboard. The predatory glint in his eyes sent a shiver down her spine - not entirely unpleasant.

Evelyn arched a brow, draping her arms around his neck with deliberate slowness. "Careful, Mr. Kensington. I still reek of last night's poor decisions."

His answer came in the form of a searing kiss that was more punishment than passion. Teeth scraped her lower lip, drawing a sharp gasp. When he pulled back, a single drop of crimson stained his mouth.

"Still feeling clever?" His voice had dropped to that dangerous register that made her pulse stutter.

Evelyn touched her stinging lip, then struck like a viper. Her teeth sank into his lower lip with equal ferocity, tasting copper and expensive coffee.

Alexander jerked back, swiping his thumb across the bloodied wound. A slow, devastating smile spread across his face. "Sweet, isn't it?"

The way the morning light caught his sharp cheekbones, the teasing lilt of his voice, the effortless grace of his posture - it was unfair how breathtaking he looked. Evelyn's traitorous heart hammered against her ribs.

Mine, something primal whispered in her mind. The possessiveness curled warm in her chest, pushing aside the remnants of her hangover. This dazzling, infuriating man was hers to unravel.

And she intended to savor every moment of it.
###Chapter 238

"What's that amazing smell?" Evelyn rubbed her nose, fighting back a sneeze. The sudden urge ruined the cozy moment between them.

"It's hangover soup," Dominic replied, releasing her from his embrace. He straightened up. "I'll get you a bowl."

By the time Evelyn sat up, Dominic had already returned with a steaming bowl in hand. "Drink it while it's hot," he instructed. "Then go take a bath and rest."

"I'm not tired," she murmured, stirring the soup with a spoon. "Are you sure this is hangover soup?" She had never tried it before, but she expected something bitter or medicinal. Instead, the aroma was rich and inviting—lotus seeds, walnuts, red dates, and plums blending into a fragrant, golden broth.

This is supposed to help with a hangover?

"I think so," Dominic said, unfazed. "It's my first time making it. I found the recipe online. Most versions sounded unappetizing, but this one seemed decent. Luckily, we had all the ingredients at home."

He leaned down, took a sip from her spoon, and straightened again, assessing the taste. "It's fine," he confirmed.

Evelyn's chest tightened with warmth.

He researched recipes, considered my taste, and even tasted it for me.

Without another word, she finished the entire bowl. The sweet-and-sour flavor was surprisingly pleasant, soothing her throbbing headache.

"Sorry," she said as she set the empty bowl aside.

"I thought you were going to thank me again," Dominic remarked, eyeing the clean bowl with satisfaction.

"I am thankful," she admitted. "But I also owe you an apology. I had no idea my alcohol tolerance was this bad. I swear, this is the first and last time I drink like this." She raised her hand as if taking an oath. "I didn’t mean to worry you."

Dominic’s gaze darkened. He lowered her hand and pressed it against his chest. "As long as you understand that you did worry me. Next time you drink, I’m going with you. If I’m not there, don’t touch a drop."

"Okay," she whispered, nestling closer.

"Go wash up and rest," he murmured, pressing a kiss to her forehead.

Evelyn clung to his neck, pouting. "No, I'm wide awake now. Dom, I have an idea I want to run by you."

"Hmm?" He wrapped an arm around her shoulders.

"Last time, I experimented with mass-market perfumes—safe, crowd-pleasing scents. They sold well, but… I want to create something different."

The thought had been brewing in her mind for a while, but she hadn’t fully fleshed it out. Maybe it was the lingering buzz from the alcohol, or maybe she just trusted him enough to share her half-formed thoughts.

"You want to launch a luxury line?" Dominic guessed after a brief pause.

Evelyn straightened, impressed. Of course he’d understand immediately. As a titan in the fashion world, he had an instinct for these things.

"Yes," she said, nodding firmly. "Exactly that."
###Chapter 239

Alexander took a moment to consider his words carefully. "To them, you're still essentially a newcomer," he said, his voice steady.

Evelyn nodded in agreement.

Despite her years in the industry, few had known she was a perfumer. She had always worked in the shadows, her creations stolen and claimed by DR Holdings and Vanessa. They had taken her recognition, her reputation—everything.

Now, she was stepping into the light, crafting fragrances under her own name. Her identity as a newcomer gave her freedom, but it also came with limitations. The elite clientele she sought demanded more than just skill—they wanted prestige, a name they could flaunt.

Luxury perfumes weren’t just about scent. They were about status. And right now, she didn’t have that.

"I know I don’t have the fame," she admitted, her voice firm. "That’s why I’m not just relying on winning the annual competition. I have another plan."

Alexander’s brow lifted in interest. "What kind of plan?"

"I’ve been working on two new fragrances," she said, a spark of determination in her eyes. "Even if I don’t win, I’ll still have something to show for it. A lesson, at the very least."

"It won’t be easy," he warned.

She smiled. "But it’s worth it. I’m doing what I love."

The sincerity in her words softened his expression. Without another word, he scooped her into his arms and carried her toward the stairs.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "What are you doing?"

His lips curved into a slow, knowing smirk. "If you’re doing what makes you happy, then so should I."

Heat rushed to her cheeks as understanding dawned. The night stretched before them, filled with pleasure and whispered promises.

"You’re late," Vanessa hissed, keeping her voice low as she glanced around nervously. She had spent hours memorizing the security camera placements, ensuring she wouldn’t be seen.

She had scouted the venue earlier under the guise of checking for potential issues. But what she hadn’t expected was for Lucien to be late—again.

He had demanded punctuality from her, yet he couldn’t be bothered to show up on time.

Her jaw tightened in frustration, but she swallowed her irritation. She needed him. And that meant waiting.
###Chapter 240

The scene repeated itself once more. Vanessa could detect the sharp scent of whiskey clinging to his clothes, but she knew better than to comment. All she could manage was to press her palm against her nose, her face twisting in distaste.

"Have you been drinking?"

"That sensitive, are we?" Lucien smirked, stepping closer with deliberate slowness.

"Tell me, can you identify what I had for dinner too?"

The alcohol fumes intensified as he neared, making her stomach churn. She recoiled instantly, putting distance between them. "Stop that!"

"Don't tell me you're squeamish." His laughter was low and mocking. "This is part of your training. A perfumer needs a refined nose, doesn't she?" His fingers brushed against her cheekbone.

Vanessa had no patience for his games. "Enough jokes. We're running out of time. Remember your promise? Can you even focus in this state?"

His gaze traveled down her body with deliberate leisure. "Why don't you test how focused I am?" He pressed the elevator button without breaking eye contact, leaving her speechless.

The lab was dark when they arrived, all equipment neatly stored away. Thankfully, Vanessa had done her homework—she knew exactly where the failed samples were hidden. Her hands trembled slightly as she flicked the lights on.

Only the night guard remained in the building. She'd told him she was pulling an all-nighter and not to disturb her. After ensuring their privacy, she'd waited in the underground parking for Lucien's arrival.

"Look at these." Vanessa motioned to the row of tiny vials she'd arranged on the counter.

"These are the recent failures. Followed your formula precisely—measurements exact. But the scent profile is off. There's contamination somewhere." Her voice tightened. This wasn't just about tonight—her entire future hinged on this. "I suspect the lavender base might be reacting with other components. Your thoughts?"

Silence.

She turned to find Lucien slumped against a worktable, eyes closed. Fury ignited in her chest.

"Lucien! You swore you'd help me!" She kept her voice low but razor-sharp. "Is this a joke to you?"

He stretched lazily. "Just resting my eyes. Stop overreacting. Minor scent deviations happen—humidity, temperature fluctuations. Basic chemistry, darling. Surely you know that?"

With deliberate slowness, he plucked the vials from her workstation and gave them a cursory sniff.

"Garbage." He tossed them into the bin with a clatter.

Vanessa lunged forward. "Are you insane? What if someone checks tomorrow?"

His grin was wolfish. "Tomorrow you'll have perfect samples. Why keep evidence of failure?"

Her anger dissolved into stunned hope. "You mean... it'll work?"

"Pathetic." Lucien shook his head as he began gathering materials from the supply closet. "Even if your formula succeeds, that transparent face of yours will betray you."

Vanessa barely heard the insult. Her entire being focused on his movements—each measured step, each selected ingredient. In this moment, he wasn't just a man. He held her destiny in those whiskey-scented hands.
###Chapter 241

Vanessa Blake wasn't good enough. Her nose lacked sensitivity, and her talent was mediocre. Years of neglect had dulled her skills, but she still understood the fundamentals. She hovered on the sidelines, assisting where she could.

She had to admit—Lucien Dubois was magnetic when he worked. His movements were precise as he dripped the extracted essential oil into the mixture, blending it with other ingredients. He stirred carefully, then set the vial on the rack to settle.

Three trials. Three test tubes.

"One of these will be what we're looking for," he murmured. "And there might be a surprise."

Vanessa tilted her head. "You mean a sister-style series?"

His lips curled into a smirk as he lifted her chin with a finger. "Not as stupid as you look."

She jerked away. "Sister-style perfumes aren't practical. Consumers won't buy two nearly identical scents. They'll pick their favorite and leave the other to collect dust."

Lucien chuckled. "That's where you're wrong. It's survival of the fittest. The public chooses the winner—the bestseller. The other becomes the budget alternative. Same scent, lower price. More profit."

Her eyes widened. "That's just counterfeiting your own product!"

Perfumers usually discarded failed experiments. But keeping a flawed version intentionally? Vanessa had never heard of such a ruthless tactic.

"Piracy is when someone else copies you," Lucien said, amused. "If it's your own creation, it's just smart business." He leaned closer, his voice dropping. "Besides, you're hardly innocent. How did DR Holdings acquire its early formulas again?"

The words struck like a blade. "That's different!" she snapped.

It shouldn't have hurt—but it did. Every reminder of her past deception twisted something inside her.

"DR Holdings' products were my work. Not stolen."

Lucien shrugged. "Not my concern. But you still owe me what you promised." His arms slid around her waist, pulling her close. "And you've been avoiding me."

His pheromones hit her like a wave, thick and suffocating. She stiffened, breath catching. "I told you—I need the right opportunity. Be patient."

"Patience is running thin, Vanessa." His grip tightened. "Are you playing me?"

She gasped. "Stop—we're in a lab!"

Lucien glanced around, then smirked. "Ah, yes. The lab." His fingers traced her jaw. "How... stimulating."
###Chapter 242

Before Vanessa could catch her breath, strong arms lifted her onto the polished mahogany table behind her.

Her pulse spiked as she recalled the obstetrician's stern warning. She pressed both palms against Lucien's chest in protest. "Lucien, stop! We can't do this!"

His charming smile vanished instantly. "Can't?" His voice turned icy. "Vanessa, you can't just discard me after everything. Remember who holds the key to your career now."

"It's not rejection," she whispered, biting her lower lip. The truth spilled out in a rush. "I'm pregnant. The doctor says it's a high-risk pregnancy."

Surprise flickered in Lucien's cerulean eyes before comprehension dawned. "Dominic's child?" At her hesitant nod, he stepped back with a scoff. "The legendary Vanessa Blake, choosing diapers over Dior."

Vanessa slid off the table, smoothing her wrinkled blouse. "That's unfair. Vivian Dubois built her empire after motherhood."

"Ah, but Vivian sacrificed everything else," Lucien countered, circling her like a predator. "Divorced, sole custody, working eighteen-hour days." His gaze turned pitying. "Tell me, darling - what makes you think you're the next Vivian?"

The question struck like a slap.

"Your mediocre sense of smell? Your two-year industry experience? Or perhaps your famous last name?" Lucien's laugh held no warmth. "Be honest - without Dominic's connections, would Phoenix Labs even know your name?"

Tears pricked Vanessa's eyes. "You're cruel."

"Realistic," he corrected. "Perfume or parenthood - choose now before life chooses for you." His finger traced her jawline. "We both know which path leads to oblivion."

The office walls seemed to close in as his words sank in. After a long silence, Vanessa whispered her decision into the heavy air between them.
###Chapter 243

Before Lucien could respond, Vanessa swiftly cut in, "Even though I've decided not to keep the baby, that doesn't mean we can proceed. I have an infection now, and it might even affect you. Can we wait until I've recovered, please?"

Lucien simply stared at her in silence.

"Don't worry," she reassured him, pressing closer and tracing a finger down his chest. "I'll keep my promise. My informant already told me Evelyn is taking a break—she’s likely traveling abroad. Handling her in Veridian City might be complicated, but overseas? That’s a different story."

"Really?" Lucien’s voice dripped with skepticism. He didn’t trust her for a second.

"Of course!" Vanessa scoffed, irritation flashing in her eyes. "Her latest product was a success, so she’s probably scouting inspiration for the next one." The thought made her blood boil. While she was drowning in problems—her failing health, Lucien’s unpredictable demands—Evelyn was thriving.

After leaving DR Holdings, Evelyn hadn’t just survived; she’d soared. Her rapid-fire perfume releases were staggering. Vanessa fantasized about sabotaging them—just a drop of acid in a batch—but for now, she had a better plan. If she could pawn Lucien off on Evelyn, it would be poetic justice. Let him be her problem.

"Oh? She succeeded?" Lucien arched a brow, mildly impressed. Though new to the industry, he had trained under a master and had elite resources. Evelyn, on the other hand, was a small-town nobody. Her rise was… unexpected.

"My source confirmed it," Vanessa said, waving a hand. "But details are locked down—no samples leaked. Who knows if it’s actually good? Either way, it’ll never surpass your work. Evelyn’s decent, but she’s no genius."

"At least she’s competent," Lucien shot back, smirking. He didn’t truly believe Evelyn could rival him, but he enjoyed needling Vanessa.

"Ugh!" Vanessa shoved him, disgusted by his obvious lust. "Listen, it doesn’t have to be Evelyn. Veridian City is full of beautiful women. I can arrange someone else while I handle her." She couldn’t risk him fixating on Evelyn—what if he switched allegiances?

Lucien’s expression darkened. "You think I’d settle for just anyone? Do I seem that desperate?"

Vanessa recoiled at his icy tone. "No! I just—I thought I’d help, since I can’t… service you right now. I’d find someone clean, safe—"

"I said no!" Lucien snarled, cutting her off. "Are you deaf?"
###Chapter 244

Lucien gripped Vanessa's chin with an intensity that made her pulse race. "I may be a man with particular tastes, but I don't settle for just anyone," he murmured, his voice low and dangerous. "Only perfection will do."

His breath ghosted over her neck, sending shivers down her spine. In that moment, he reminded her of a predator—hungry, relentless, and utterly intoxicating.

Vanessa held her breath, terrified yet mesmerized.

To her relief, he didn’t sink his teeth into her skin like some mythical creature. Instead, his lips brushed against her throat in a teasing caress before he nipped lightly. "The fragrance I crave only lingers on perfumers like you."

Her mind reeled.

He released her, stepping back, but Vanessa remained frozen, afraid any sudden movement might reignite his hunger. It made sense now—Lucien was drawn to female perfumers, their bodies carrying traces of the scents they crafted. Some might find it overwhelming, but for him, it was irresistible.

Does that mean he’s obsessed with the essence of perfume itself?

Before she could process the thought, the timer chimed.

It was ready.

Vanessa darted to the counter, her fingers hovering over the three test tubes. Excitement warred with doubt—what if she had failed?

"Stop hesitating," Lucien commanded, his hand closing over hers as he plucked the middle vial. He inhaled deeply, his eyes darkening with approval. "This one."

His certainty pulled her in. She leaned closer, catching the rich floral notes—close to what she had envisioned, but not quite complete. It still needed time to mature.

Yet, his confidence reassured her. Despite his terrifying intensity, Vanessa never doubted his expertise. "Lucien," she vowed, staring at the shimmering liquid, "if I win this year’s championship, I’ll make sure you’re properly rewarded."

Her imagination conjured the trophy in her hands, the triumph, the glory—

A rough embrace shattered the fantasy.

Lucien pressed against her from behind, his body flush against hers, his voice a sinful whisper in her ear. "Such a cruel promise. Why tease me when you won’t deliver now?"

His warmth seeped into her, his breath sending tremors through her. Vanessa stiffened. "I—I told you why. I’m not trying to—"

"Hush." A finger silenced her lips. "You want to help me?"

She hesitated only a heartbeat before nodding. "Yes."

His chuckle was dark, promising. "Then there’s something you can do for me."
###Chapter 245

Lucien’s grip tightened on Vanessa’s shoulders as he spun her around with a rough jerk.

“There are more interesting ways to assist me,” he murmured, his voice dripping with dark amusement.

Vanessa stiffened. “Interesting?”

The smirk on his face made her stomach churn. She knew exactly what he meant. The thought alone repulsed her, but she forced herself to stay calm.

“Lucien,” she said carefully, “if you could just wait a little longer, I’ll arrange someone stunning from the industry for you. What about your usual partners? I can even drive you there myself. With my morning sickness, this would just be—”

Before she could finish, Lucien yanked her hair back, forcing her to meet his cold gaze.

“Enough excuses,” he hissed. “What does your pregnancy have to do with me? Is the child mine?” His grip tightened. “Vanessa, you should know better than to play games with me. Don’t forget—you still need my help to win that year-end championship.” His lips curled into a cruel smile. “Consider it an honor that I’ve chosen you. Don’t make me angry.”

Fear coiled in her chest, but she forced a shaky smile. “I didn’t mean it like that. I just—”

“Just shut up and do as you’re told,” he snapped.

Neither of them noticed the door creaking open—until blinding light flooded the room.

Vanessa’s breath caught.

They had been careless. When they first entered, they had only turned on the dim side lamps, leaving the door slightly ajar. Vanessa had made sure no one would disturb them.

But now, standing in the doorway, was Dominic.

His face was a mask of horror, fury, and disgust. His fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white. For a moment, he couldn’t even speak—as if an invisible hand had wrapped around his throat.

Vanessa scrambled to stand, her face burning with shame. She couldn’t bring herself to look at him.

She had known this moment would come eventually.

But not like this.

Not with him witnessing it.

Lucien, however, remained unfazed. He straightened his clothes lazily, meeting Dominic’s glare with a mocking smirk.

“Vanessa Blake!” Dominic’s voice was a raw, guttural roar.

The woman he had once loved—the woman he had trusted—was doing this.

Disgust churned in his gut.

Rage burned through him.

And worst of all—the crushing weight of betrayal.
###Chapter 246

"Since my job here is finished, I'm out!" Lucien gave Vanessa's shoulder a light pat before strolling casually toward the exit, completely unfazed by the furious man blocking his path.

"Hold it right there!" Dominic's fingers clamped around Lucien's forearm, his jaw clenched so tight his teeth ached. "You really think you can just walk away?"

"And why not?" Lucien's lips curled into a mocking smirk.

Dominic had been restraining himself, painfully aware of Lucien's influence—one wrong move could cost him everything. But that taunting grin shattered his self-control. His fist flew before he could think, connecting hard with Lucien's jaw. "You bastard!"

The impact sent Lucien stumbling back, but he barely flinched. Wiping the blood from his split lip, he chuckled darkly. "I'll let that slide for Ms. Sinclair's sake. Try it again, and I won't be so forgiving."

"Like hell I care!" Lucien's arrogance was gasoline on Dominic's fury. Having already crossed the line, he lunged again, swinging wildly.

True to his word, Lucien stopped holding back. The two men crashed into each other, fists flying, furniture toppling in their wake.

Vanessa had been bent over the sink, fighting nausea, but the sound of shattering glass snapped her attention back to the chaos.

She took a deep breath, steadying herself before rushing forward. "Stop it! Both of you!"

Her pleas fell on deaf ears. The fight spilled into the hallway, leaving destruction in its wake—overturned chairs, splintered wood, glass shards glinting like fallen stars. The noise was deafening, and Vanessa's stomach twisted at the thought of security storming in.

"Dominic!" she finally screamed, desperation sharpening her voice. "Do you want the whole building to hear about this?"

Her words struck like a whip. Dominic froze—just long enough for Lucien's fist to slam into his jaw. A grunt of pain escaped him, his vision swimming. Thankfully, Lucien stepped back, panting, his knuckles bruised.

"Dom—" Vanessa rushed to Dominic's side, ignoring Lucien entirely. She knew reasoning with him was pointless, but Dominic still cared about appearances.

Dominic swayed as he stood, his head pounding. When his vision cleared enough to see Vanessa's worried face, rage surged anew. He shoved her away with a snarl. "Get the hell away from me!"

She stumbled backward, saved only by Lucien's quick reflexes. His grip on her arm only fueled Dominic's fury further.
###Chapter 247

"Let her go!" Dominic's expression darkened instantly.

"Don't be so dramatic." Lucien smirked, undeterred. He leaned in closer to Vanessa, his lips dangerously near hers.

Dominic saw red. He lunged forward, ready to strike Lucien again.

But Vanessa caught his arm. "Stop! Do you want the entire office to hear this commotion, Dom?!"

Her voice was steady, almost righteous—as if she hadn’t been entangled in that compromising position moments ago. Yet her words made Dominic hesitate. The last thing he needed was for this scandal to spread.

"Get out!" He pointed toward the door, his voice trembling with suppressed rage.

Vanessa shot Lucien a sharp look, but he remained where he was, arms crossed, that infuriating smirk still in place. His eyes, however, held nothing but disdain.

She frowned, silently urging him to leave. If Lucien stayed any longer, she wouldn’t be able to control Dominic’s temper. With a careless shrug, Lucien finally sauntered toward the elevator, taking his sweet time before disappearing.

"Dom—"

"I said get out!" Dominic roared before she could finish.

"I know you're furious," she said carefully, "but you need to calm down." She gestured toward the desk. "The new prototype is ready. I tested it myself—it works. I also revised the formula. Submit it for review at dawn. Once approved, we can send it straight to production."

Her voice hardened. "This will save DR Holdings. If you act recklessly now, you won’t just destroy the company—you’ll ruin everything. Do you understand?!"

Dominic stood frozen, his gaze distant, as if he hadn’t heard a word. His knuckles were still bleeding. Vanessa reached for his hand, but he yanked it away.

"You have a reason?" His laugh was hollow. "Do you think I’m a fool, Vanessa? I saw it with my own eyes!" He jabbed a finger at his face, wishing he could claw the memory away.

"Go. I don’t want to see you. You’re done here." He turned, staggering toward the elevator like a man defeated.

"Dom!" Vanessa called after him, but he didn’t look back.

She exhaled sharply, surveying the wreckage of the lab. After a moment, she tucked the prototype and documents into her bag and dialed the cleaning crew. "There was an accident during testing. The lab needs immediate cleanup before morning."

Dominic sped through the city, his mind numb. The images from the lab flashed in his head—Vanessa, Lucien, their closeness. He couldn’t shake them.

To him, Vanessa had always been perfect—gentle, playful, irresistibly alluring. She was everything he’d ever wanted. For her, he had manipulated Evelyn, risked his career, nearly destroyed himself.

And now?

Now he wasn’t sure of anything.
###Chapter 248

Dominic slammed his fist against the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white. Nausea churned in his stomach, his vision blurred, and the world spun around him. The car veered wildly, tires screeching as it careened across the empty road like a drunkard’s reckless joyride.

Then—crash!

The impact sent a jolt through his body as the car smashed into a tree, the hood crumpling like paper. Pain exploded in his skull, warm blood trickling down his temple.

Evelyn stretched lazily as sunlight streamed through the curtains, warming her skin. To her surprise, there was no pounding headache, no lingering fog of alcohol—just the crisp clarity of a perfect morning.

Alexander’s hangover remedy actually worked.

The rich aroma of breakfast drifted upstairs, pulling her out of bed. She slipped into her slippers and padded downstairs, where Alexander stood by the stove, an apron tied around his waist.

Her heart swelled at the sight.

She tiptoed behind him, wrapping her arms around his waist before pressing a soft kiss to his cheek. "Good morning."

Alexander chuckled, turning to capture her lips in a quick, affectionate kiss. "Sit. Breakfast is ready."

The table was laden with food—fluffy scrambled eggs, golden-brown sausages, fresh fruit, and buttery toast. But what caught her attention was the glass of honey lemonade he placed in front of her.

"You’re still making me drink this?" She wrinkled her nose playfully.

"Consider it digestive aid," he insisted, his tone leaving no room for argument.

With a dramatic sigh, she took a sip—then blinked in surprise. "It’s actually good."

Alexander smirked. "Of course it is. I made it."

As they ate, he checked his phone, playing a voice memo from his assistant. "Mr. Kensington, your schedule today includes three back-to-back meetings and a lunch appointment with Mr. Whitmore from Celestia Group at The Canopy. The first meeting starts at—"

He stopped the playback mid-sentence, glancing at Evelyn. "You get the idea."

She stifled a laugh. "So, no free time for me today?"

"I’ll make time," he promised, just as Harrison appeared in the doorway, waiting discreetly.

"Did you get her home safely last night?" Alexander asked, though he already knew the answer.

Harrison nodded. "All the way to her lobby."

Evelyn’s brows furrowed. "Wait—you’re talking about Bella?"

Alexander gave her a knowing look. "You really don’t remember anything from last night, do you?"

She groaned, burying her face in her hands. "I was that drunk?"

His laughter filled the kitchen, warm and rich. "Let’s just say you had opinions about the wine selection."

Evelyn groaned again. "I need another glass of that lemonade."
###Chapter 249

"Yes." Alexander Kensington gave a firm nod.

"Thank you!" Evelyn Carter expressed her gratitude sincerely. But this only stoked Dominic Reeves' jealousy. "You only thank him? What about me?"

Evelyn smirked. "I don’t need to be so formal with you." Before Dominic could protest, she added, "Hey, you were the one who said we shouldn’t stand on ceremony."

Well, that backfired spectacularly, Dominic thought, inwardly groaning.

Harrison, his assistant, watched in quiet amusement as his usually unshakable boss floundered under Evelyn’s teasing. Only Ms. Carter can render him speechless like this.

"I might be late tonight. Call me if you need anything," Dominic said, shrugging into his coat.

"Got it." Evelyn rose onto her toes to straighten his collar, her fingers brushing lightly against his neck. A sudden memory surfaced. "Oh, right—you mentioned a vacation earlier. Have you picked a destination yet?"

"Not yet. Why?"

"Nothing major. Vanessa Blake has a few suggestions. Since you’re swamped and haven’t decided, why don’t Sophia Grant, Victoria Sterling, and I handle the planning?"

Dominic’s lips quirked. "Fine by me."

"You’re the best!"

She pressed a quick kiss to his lips, and he chuckled. "If I’d known a trip was all it took to make you this happy, I’d have scheduled one every month."

"Deal!" Evelyn grinned, then nudged him toward the door. "Now go, or you’ll be late for your meeting." She waited until his car disappeared down the driveway before turning back inside.

With Dominic’s blessing, all that remained was coordinating with Sophia and Victoria. Flipping on the morning news, Evelyn dialed Sophia.

"Did you bring me home last night?"

"Oh, you do remember!" Sophia teased. "I thought you were too far gone."

Evelyn winced. The night was a blur—she’d need to be more careful next time. She rarely drank and had no idea her tolerance was this abysmal. "Please tell me I didn’t do anything embarrassing."

"Of course you did. You babbled nonstop, refused to leave, and demanded we keep drinking. I practically had to drag you out."

"What?!" Evelyn gasped, horrified.

Sophia burst out laughing. "Relax! I’m messing with you. You just conked out. The only struggle was getting your address out of you—good thing Mr. Kensington showed up when he did."

She paused, then lowered her voice. "By the way, I told Victoria you live near Crestview Heights. Since it’s close to Magnolia Avenue, she bought it. You almost blew your cover last night. Don’t mix them up again."

Evelyn groaned. Note to self: never drink near loose-lipped friends.
###Chapter 250

"Thanks, Bella!"

"No need to thank me. It's what I should do." Isabella balanced a stack of clothes in one arm while wedging her phone between her shoulder and ear. Her voice crackled slightly over the line. "Though I never expected you to already be living with the boss. That was... fast."

Evelyn hesitated. Would Bella be shocked if she knew she and Alexander had already signed their marriage papers? Technically, they'd done it ages ago.

"Bella, I'm not judging you, but I need to say something that might sound harsh." Bella's tone shifted, serious now. "Alexander is incredible—handsome, powerful, the whole package. But that's exactly why you need to be careful. I'm not saying he's bad, just... too good. You get what I mean?"

Evelyn understood. Bella wasn’t criticizing—she was worried.

Last time, with Dominic, Evelyn had given everything, only to end up heartbroken. Now, Alexander was on another level entirely. If things went well, great. But if they didn’t?

Wealthy families weren’t kind to outsiders. Bella didn’t want Evelyn to become another cautionary tale.

"I get it," Evelyn said.

"No, you don’t," Bella countered.

Evelyn sighed.

"Alexander is the most eligible bachelor in Veridian City. His world is full of stunning, ambitious women. Evelyn, I’m not trying to jinx you, but you have to protect yourself. Think ahead." Bella paused, then groaned. "Ugh, forget it. I’m rambling."

Evelyn chuckled. "I know you mean well, you nosy little thing. Honestly, I never realized how much of a worrier you were. Tell me—when Harrison drove you home, did you lecture him the whole way?"

The image of stoic, silent Harrison enduring Bella’s chatter made Evelyn grin.

"Hey! I’m being serious, and you’re teasing me? Fine, I’ll shut up." Bella’s voice hitched, and Evelyn could practically hear her blushing.

Harrison was... different. After their rocky first meeting, Bella had to admit—he was solid. Dependable. The kind of man who made you feel safe.

Not like Alexander, who was dazzling but unpredictable.

Bella suddenly snapped back to reality, shaking her head. What am I even thinking?

"Bella? Bella!" Evelyn called when she got no response.

"Y-yeah, I’m here. What?"

"What were you doing? Sounded like you were slapping yourself."

"Mosquito," Bella lied quickly. "Annoying little thing. Anyway, what were you saying?"

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. A mosquito? In this weather?

But she let it go. "About the trip—you had suggestions, right? Alexander said we can plan it ourselves. Let’s meet up and figure it out. When are you free?"

"Today works."

"Perfect. We can grab dinner and—"

Evelyn’s words died as the TV flashed breaking news.

"A severe car accident occurred early this morning in Veridian City. A white Summit Trailhawk veered out of control, colliding with multiple barriers before crashing into a roadside tree. The victim, identified as Dominic Reeves, CEO of DR Holdings, has been rushed to Mercy General Hospital in critical condition. Authorities are investigating the cause. Stay tuned for updates."
###Chapter 251

Dominic Reeves felt like his skull was splitting open. The pain radiated from his forehead, sharp and unrelenting.

His eyelids burned when he tried to open them. Even the smallest movement sent waves of agony through his body.

When he finally managed to wake, the throbbing in his head was unbearable.

It wasn’t just his head—his chest ached, his limbs felt heavy, and every inch of his skin screamed in protest. He attempted to shift his legs, but below his thighs, there was nothing. No sensation. No response.

Panic clawed at his throat.

His vision blurred as he took in his surroundings—white walls, sterile air, the faint hum of medical equipment. A drip hung beside him, its slow, rhythmic drops the only sound in the room.

He tried to speak, but his voice came out hoarse, barely audible.

Memories flooded back.

He had gone to the lab to find Evelyn.

Then he had seen—

And then—

The accident.

The tree.

The impact.

Am I still alive?

Why can’t I feel my legs?!

His breath hitched. He forced himself to call out, "Hey—someone! Anyone!"

His attempt to sit up sent fresh pain shooting through his ribs.

Footsteps rushed toward him.

"Dominic!"

The voice made his blood run cold.

Vanessa Blake stood over him, her expression a mix of relief and concern.

His stomach twisted.

"Get out," he snarled.

"Dominic—"

"I said get out!" He couldn’t stand the sight of her. Not now. Not after everything.

His hands clenched into fists, but he had no strength to throw anything. The only thing he managed was dislodging the IV needle in his arm.

"Dominic, don’t—let me call the nurse!" Vanessa scrambled for help.

A nurse arrived moments later, adjusting the IV with practiced efficiency. "The medication hasn’t fully worn off yet. You can move a little, but don’t overdo it. If the needle bends, I’ll have to reinsert it."

Dominic barely processed her words.

"My legs," he rasped. "Can I still move them?"

The nurse blinked. "Of course."

His breath caught.

"I—I wasn’t amputated?"

She gave him a strange look. "No? Your legs are fine. You fractured two ribs, but the surgery went well. You just need rest."

Dominic exhaled shakily.

The tree had been massive. The impact—

He had assumed the worst.

But now, as the numbness faded, he could feel it—the faintest twitch in his toes.

He tried again, focusing.

Nothing visible moved beneath the hospital blanket.

But the sensation was there.

Weak.

But real.
###Chapter 252

Vanessa could sense Dominic's next move. She rushed forward, catching his blanket before it slipped, her fingers immediately working to knead the tension from his calves.

"See? Your legs are still attached! You're perfectly fine, so stop worrying. Just trust me!"
"Trust you?"

Dominic shot her a sideways glance, his lips curling into a bitter smirk. "I trusted you far too much already."

Vanessa bit her lip, swallowing her retort. With a quiet sigh, she adjusted his blanket and straightened. "I know you despise me right now—enough to want me dead. But I never lied to you, Dominic. Everything I did was for DR Holdings, for us. That doesn't excuse the pain I caused you, though. So go ahead. Hit me. Curse me. I'll take it all. But you have to stay calm. Don't hurt yourself over this. Promise me?"

Her voice was soft, laced with guilt, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. Dominic remained silent, his jaw clenched, but he didn't order her out again.

"Do you have any idea how terrified I was when I heard about your accident? I thought I'd lost you forever." Her hand hovered over his, barely grazing his knuckles. "Dominic, I can't lose you. I love you."

He yanked his hand away, but she didn't flinch. "Theo confirmed the new perfume formula is flawless. That means our research is a success. However furious you are, don't let it sabotage our work. Dominic, this product will save DR Holdings."

A heavy silence stretched between them before Dominic finally spoke, his voice dripping with disdain. "He gave you the report, didn't he?"

The word "he" was spat out like poison—Lucien's name too vile to utter.

Vanessa didn't deny it. "Yes."

"You didn't bring him to Phoenix Labs just to tweak formulas." Dominic's piercing gaze locked onto her face, searching for lies. "Did you?"

"No." She met his eyes squarely.

Dominic let out a hollow laugh, his smile brittle. "Vanessa, you crossed a line."

"I did. But it was for DR Holdings. For us." She leaned closer, urgency sharpening her tone. "You know my standards. You know how incompetent most of Phoenix Labs' team is. After Evelyn's scandal, our sales are plummeting. Our reputation is in ruins. That manufacturing disaster nearly bankrupted us!" She drew a shaky breath. "If we don't launch something groundbreaking soon, we won't just miss the annual perfumery awards—we'll lose everything. The board will destroy you."

Dominic's expression remained stony.

"Two months, Dominic. That's all we have. If we fail, what happens to you? To me? To DR Holdings?"

At last, a flicker of reaction. His lips twitched, his chest rising unevenly as he shut his eyes.

When he exhaled, it carried the weight of surrender.

Because as much as he loathed to admit it, Vanessa was right.

DR Holdings was a sinking ship. The world still saw glittering success, but Dominic knew the truth—the cracks spreading beneath the gilded surface. Without a miracle product, the empire would crumble. The board would abandon him. Investors would flee.

And he refused to let that happen.
###Chapter 253

"Are you certain the formula is ready?" Dominic's voice was barely above a whisper, raw and strained. Each word scraped against his throat like broken glass.

Though he still refused to meet Vanessa's gaze, the fact that he spoke at all was enough for her. It meant he was willing to listen.

"Yes. We tested it last night to be sure. To avoid any risks, we skipped the rest, so we—" She tried to explain.

But her words grated on his nerves. He had been forcing himself to forget, yet the moment she uttered "last night" and "we," the memory surged back—vivid, relentless, igniting his fury all over again.

He clenched his fists, knuckles whitening, and hissed through gritted teeth, "Don't. Mention. Last night. Again."

Vanessa fell silent and sank into the chair beside his hospital bed. Studying his profile, she said quietly, "I never meant to hurt you like this. But since you found out, I owe you the truth. Yes, I was wrong. But you can't deny that you've always been the man I love. It's always been you, Dominic. Only you. What happened between us and him—it was just a deal. I didn't do it for myself alone."

Dominic threw his head back and laughed—a harsh, bitter sound that tore through the room. The sudden movement wrenched his injuries, pain lancing through his limbs, but he didn’t stop. He laughed until his eyes burned. "So you’re saying you did it for me too? Should I thank you both, then?"

When he finally turned to face her, his smile was razor-thin, edged with mockery and rage.

"Mock me all you want," Vanessa said, her voice steady. "But everything I did was for us. For our future. That’s the truth, whether you believe it or not."

Her composure was unnerving. She spoke with such conviction that it sounded like a vow.

"Vanessa Blake," Dominic sneered. "I never knew you could twist words so beautifully." His voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "Where were you when I was drowning in accusations? When I was stranded in Silverpine Valley with no one? When Evelyn humiliated me in front of everyone? And the formula—who created that mess? Who fixed it for you? Tell me, is DR Holdings not benefiting from this new formula?"

His words lashed at her, but she didn’t flinch. Instead, her own anger flared. "You blame me, but have you ever asked why I had to do this? Do you think I wanted this? I wish I could be some pampered socialite, spending my days shopping and getting manicures! But who pushed me onto this path?"

Dominic’s expression flickered with confusion. "Are you seriously blaming me now?"

Vanessa swiped at the tear threatening to escape, inhaling sharply. "I’m not blaming you. I’m saying none of this was what either of us wanted. If I’d had another choice—"

She broke off, then continued softly, "Dominic, I’ve loved you since we were students. That hasn’t changed. Past, present, future—it’s always been you. The only reason I endured watching you chase after Evelyn was because I loved you. Would I have stayed as your secret if I didn’t? You know everything I’ve sacrificed for you. I’ve never wronged you before this."

Slowly, she rose to her feet, looking down at him with icy detachment. "If you can’t accept what happened, then fine. We can end this."

Without another word, she turned and walked out of the hospital room.

By lunchtime, Evelyn and Isabella had finalized most of the details for their upcoming trip.
###Chapter 254

The sun hung low in the sky, casting golden streaks across the horizon as two women found themselves drawn to the ocean for entirely different reasons.

Evelyn Carter had spent her childhood surrounded by endless fields and rolling hills, the scent of earth and wildflowers her constant companions. The vast, untamed sea was a mystery she longed to unravel.

Sophia Grant, on the other hand, sought inspiration. Though she had visited the shore before, the memories were distant, faded like an old photograph. She barely recalled the sensation of sand between her toes or the salt-kissed breeze against her skin. Perhaps this time, she would see it with fresh eyes.

After settling on their destination, the only hurdle left was securing permission from their formidable CEO, Alexander Kensington. Coordinating with Victoria Sterling’s schedule was another challenge, but luck seemed to be on their side.

A comfortable silence settled between them as they finalized the details. Evelyn scrolled through her phone, then abruptly lifted her gaze, hesitating before finally voicing the question that had been gnawing at her.

"Did you hear about Dominic Reeves? The bastard ended up in the hospital after a car accident."

Sophia’s fingers stilled. "I saw the news."

She had been on the phone with Evelyn when the report flashed across the screen. For a moment, she thought it must be a mistake—some other unfortunate soul sharing Dominic’s name. But the confirmation came swiftly: the CEO of DR Holdings, the man she once loved, had nearly met his end on a quiet stretch of road.

Dominic had always been meticulous behind the wheel, a man who calculated risks and avoided recklessness. Yet the footage showed a scene of devastation—shattered glass, twisted metal, a tree split from the force of impact. If the reporter had declared him dead at the scene, she might have believed it.

"Karma’s a bitch," Evelyn muttered, tapping the table lightly. "The road was empty. No alcohol, no drugs. Just him and his car. So why the hell did he plow straight into a tree?"

Sophia hadn’t dug into the details as deeply as Evelyn had. But now, the strangeness of it settled over her like a shadow.

"Penny for your thoughts?" Evelyn prodded.

Sophia exhaled, feigning indifference. "What thoughts? It’s not my business anymore."

She wasn’t entirely unaffected—Dominic had been a significant part of her life, the man she once thought she’d spend forever with. But that love had withered, poisoned by betrayal, legal battles, and his relentless attempts to smear her name.

He was alive. That was all that mattered. Or so she told herself.

Evelyn, however, wasn’t satisfied. "That’s not the point. Doesn’t it strike you as… eerie?"

Sophia frowned. "What do you mean?"

"You really don’t care, do you?" Evelyn sighed dramatically before lowering her voice, glancing around as if someone might overhear. "No intoxication. No other cars. Just him, alone in that car. So tell me—do you think something else was in there with him?"

Sophia blinked. "What?"

Evelyn leaned in, eyes wide with theatrical suspicion. "A ghost."

Sophia stared at her, then burst into laughter. "You’re ridiculous."

But as the words hung between them, an inexplicable chill crept down her spine.
###Chapter 255

"What kind of nonsense are you spouting?" Evelyn poked a finger at Sophia’s forehead, pushing her back into her seat.

"Hey! There are just some things we can’t explain in this world!" Sophia huffed, adjusting herself as she sat back down, convinced her logic was flawless. "I think the universe is finally punishing Dominic for all his terrible deeds!"

Evelyn shook her head. "Enough. I’m getting the bill. Stay put, gossip queen."

"You’d be bored out of your mind without my juicy updates!" Sophia shot back defensively.

As Evelyn stood, her gaze lingered on Sophia’s phone still open on the table. The screen displayed images of the accident, making her wonder—Was this really karma catching up to Dominic?

After parting ways with Sophia, Evelyn wandered down Antiquarius Lane, savoring her rare free time. The street was lined with antique shops, a mix of genuine relics and clever forgeries, leaving buyers to judge authenticity for themselves.

Halfway down the lane, a small, unmarked shop caught her eye. Though modest in size, its wares were meticulously arranged, reflecting the owner’s refined taste.

The moment Evelyn stepped closer, a delicate fragrance enveloped her—subtle yet refreshing, perfectly matching the shop’s serene atmosphere. Inside, no one greeted her, as if the place operated without an owner.

She studied the items, noting most were carved from wood, each piece distinct in design and material. The craftsmanship wasn’t extraordinary, but every piece had a unique charm. Something about this place felt different from the others.

Evelyn lingered, admiring without touching, in no hurry to leave. Then, a deep voice broke the silence. "Looking for something specific?"

Startled, she turned toward the corner where a man sat, previously hidden by shadows and clutter. Now, his steady gaze met hers—calm, like the wooden artifacts surrounding them.

"Just browsing," Evelyn replied with a smile. "Your shop has an interesting scent—like a blend of stories."

The man, who appeared no older than his late twenties, arched a brow. "Most customers care about the items, not the air." His tone was sharp.

Evelyn smirked, eyeing the half-carved piece in his hands. "Did you make everything here?"

"Buy or leave. Does it matter who carved them?" He exhaled impatiently, ready to dismiss her.

"Of course it does," Evelyn countered. "I wouldn’t eat a dish made by a chef I dislike. If these are yours, I might buy. Since they’re not, I’ll pass."

His grip tightened on the carving tool. "Here to argue instead of shop?"

She grinned. "You looked lonely. Thought I’d keep you company."
###Chapter 256

"You're quite the character." Evelyn Carter studied the young man behind the counter. His baby face contrasted sharply with his sharp tongue. "Though you've got a lot to learn about customer service. Look how red you're getting just from this conversation."

"Get out if you're not buying anything!" The boy slammed his carving tools down. "You're distracting me from my work."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Most shopkeepers worried about losing business, not about being distracted. This one was different. And the more he snapped at her, the more intrigued she became.

"I never said I wasn't buying," she countered, running her fingers along a wooden figurine. "I just haven't found the right piece yet."

"You won't find anything here! Just leave already!"

Evelyn nearly laughed. In all her years of shopping in Veridian City's Antiquarius Lane, she'd never met a merchant who chased customers away.

Before she could respond, the curtain behind the counter rustled. An older man emerged, scowling at the apprentice. "Scaring away customers again, Julian? Do you want to keep this job or not?"

The fiery young man instantly deflated, shoulders slumping. "I—"

"So you're not the owner?" Evelyn's lips curved knowingly.

Julian's head snapped up, face flushing crimson with humiliation. He opened his mouth—

"Quiet!" The older man barked. "How many times must I tell you? Customers are our livelihood! Who's going to buy these carvings if you frighten everyone away? Back to work!" He turned to Evelyn with practiced charm. "My apologies, madam. How may I assist you today?"

Evelyn watched Julian return to his carving, the storm of emotions passing over his face like clouds across the sun. Fascinating how quickly his temper flared and faded.

"I'm just browsing," she said, examining the shop's wares. "You have remarkable wood here."

"Carvings," the owner corrected stiffly. "Each piece is handcrafted by master artisans. Unique designs, exquisite details—"

A derisive snort came from Julian's corner.

The owner glared at his apprentice before continuing smoothly, "Perfect for home decoration or prestigious gifts. What specifically are you—"

"Not the carvings," Evelyn interrupted. "The wood itself. There's something special about it."

The shopkeeper blinked. "The... wood?"

"Yes." Evelyn picked up a half-carved block Julian had abandoned. "This grain pattern, this scent... Where does it come from?"

Julian's head jerked up, his carving knife freezing mid-stroke. Their eyes met—his wide with surprise, hers alight with discovery.

The apprentice and the customer shared a silent understanding that left the shop owner utterly confused.
###Chapter 257

The scent of aged wood and fresh shavings filled the air as Evelyn stepped into the quaint little shop.

"I think it has a unique aroma," she remarked without hesitation.

"Your shop carries a blend of fragrances," she continued, her gaze sweeping over the shelves. "You must use different types of wood for your carvings, am I right?"

At first, the shopkeeper looked puzzled, but then his expression shifted to understanding.

"My, my! You have a discerning eye," he said, his enthusiasm returning. "We only work with the finest wood here, and I guarantee you'll find exactly what you're looking for. Miss, what kind of wood would you prefer for your carvings? If nothing here catches your eye, we also take custom orders. As for the price—"

"You do custom work here as well?" Evelyn asked, intrigued.

"Of course! Every customer has unique tastes. Though this is a modest shop, we strive to meet every request. Custom pieces do cost more, but the quality speaks for itself. The most important thing is your satisfaction."

Evelyn appreciated his eagerness. It saved her time. "You make a good point. Do many customers place custom orders?"

"Not exactly," he admitted. "Occasionally, but not many can afford—" He stopped abruptly, suddenly wary. "Miss, why all the questions? Are you here to buy something or place an order? If it's the latter, just write down your specifications and leave a deposit."

Evelyn smiled and glanced around the shop again. The owner, sensing hesitation, grew impatient.

"Miss, if you're not buying anything, feel free to browse."

He turned to leave, but Evelyn pointed to a pair of wooden figurines on display. "I'll take those."

They were carvings of two children—a round-faced boy with a cheerful grin and a little girl with twin ponytails clutching a lollipop. The craftsmanship wasn't flawless, but their expressions were full of life. They were the most charming pieces in the shop.

"Excellent choice!" The shopkeeper beamed, carefully lifting them from the shelf.

Then he turned to the young man lingering nearby. "What are you still sitting around for? Get a box and wrap this up for the lady!"

Slowly, the young man rose and fetched a box and paper bag to package the figurines.

Evelyn approached the counter to pay. "Actually, I'd like to place a custom order. Could it be ready by next month?"

A thought struck her, and she added, "What kind of wood do you recommend? I need something about this size." She gestured toward the unfinished piece in the young man's hands. "I'll provide the rest of the details in a few days. Would that work?"

"Absolutely!" The owner nodded eagerly. "Just leave the deposit, and we'll get started."

"There's one more thing," Evelyn said.

"Name it."

"I want him to carve it for me." She pointed directly at the young man.

His head snapped up in surprise, as if he hadn't heard correctly.

The shopkeeper frowned. "Him? He's still learning. We have master craftsmen for custom orders."

"It's fine," Evelyn cut in. She walked over and examined the young man's half-finished work. "I think he's quite skilled. I want him to handle my piece."

"I can't do it," the young man muttered.

Evelyn straightened, unfazed. "I believe you can. But if you refuse, I'll take my business elsewhere." She took the paper bag and turned toward the door.
###Chapter 258

The shopkeeper stopped Evelyn in her tracks, unwilling to let such a lucrative opportunity slip away. "Madam, wait!"

His voice was eager, almost desperate. "Thank you for admiring his work. Your interest is a great honor. I oversee everything here, so he doesn’t get to choose his commissions. He’ll take your order, and I assure you, he’ll craft something exquisite. You won’t regret it!"

"Boss, I—"

"Quiet! If you refuse, you can leave for good!"

After paying the deposit and receiving her receipt, Evelyn approached the block of wood the young man was still carving. She studied it for a moment before bending down to pick up a discarded scrap. "May I take this?"

"Of course!" The owner waved dismissively—it was just a worthless fragment.

Evelyn hadn’t walked far before she heard footsteps trailing her. She paused, sensing the person behind her do the same.

A slow smile curved her lips.

She quickened her pace, then abruptly turned into a narrow alley, pressing her back against the cold brick wall. Moments later, the young man appeared, scanning the street in confusion.

"Looking for me?"

He startled as Evelyn stepped into view, her expression amused.

Caught, he dropped all pretense. "Why did you choose me?" His voice was wary.

"Because your skill is exceptional."

"You haven’t seen anything I’ve finished. How would you know?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Why would I waste time sabotaging you?" She pulled the scrap of wood from her pocket. "Besides, I have seen your work. That unfinished piece in the shop? It was already breathtaking."

His defiance flickered. "It’s not done yet."

"I know. But the precision in the lines, the flow of the grain—it’s unmistakable." She leaned in slightly. "You carved most of the pieces in that shop, didn’t you? Even the ones I bought today."

His eyes widened. "How—?"

"Technique leaves a signature. Yours is distinctive."

The truth was obvious now—the owner’s claims of a team of master artisans were a lie. He relied solely on this young man’s talent while taking credit for it.

A spark of excitement lit the carver’s gaze. "Are you a craftsman too?"

Evelyn shook her head. "No. But I have a question." She held up the scrap. "Does your boss source all his wood in bulk? Or…?"

"Why do you care?"

"Curiosity." She arched a brow. "Can’t you tell me?"

He hesitated, then relented. "Most of it’s bulk orders. If you want suppliers, ask him."

"Everything?" She twirled the wood between her fingers. "Even this?"
###Chapter 259

The young man hesitated before answering firmly, "Yes! Is there an issue?"

"Not at all. In that case, I'd like you to use this specific wood for my order. As for the design, I'll need some time to decide. Once I have, I'll inform your boss," Evelyn replied, twirling the scrap of wood between her fingers before turning to leave.

"Wait!" The young man's voice was laced with urgency.

Evelyn paused, then turned back to face him. "What is it?"

"I—I'm not sure about the size you want. There might not be enough of this wood available." His brows furrowed in concern.

"That shouldn't be a problem. Your boss can always procure more," Evelyn said with a casual shrug. "That's his responsibility, not yours."

He pressed his lips together. "The factory won't have enough either. You just... can't use this type of wood."

There was something he wasn’t telling her. Evelyn didn’t press him—instead, she simply smiled. "Honesty suits you, kid."

"Kid?" His cheeks flushed. "You're barely older than me!"

"Regardless, I'll be discussing this with your boss." She had found his weak spot, and it was amusing how easily he reacted.

"Why are you so insistent on this wood?" he demanded, frustration making his voice rise. "I can use another kind—it’ll be just as good, no, even better!"

Evelyn tilted her head. "If they're the same, then why can't I use this one? What makes it so special?"

Silence.

She stepped closer, her smile never wavering. "Or is there something different about it? The scent, perhaps?"

The young man stiffened. Though Evelyn’s expression was gentle, there was an undeniable intensity about her—something that made him want to retreat.

"Who are you?" he asked warily.

"Me?" She glanced at the wood in her hand. "Just a customer."

The scrap looked ordinary at first glance, but upon closer inspection, there was a faint, unusual stain along the grain—dried liquid from when the wood had been cut.

And it carried a fragrance unlike anything Evelyn had ever encountered.

Not synthetic, not blended—this was raw, natural, intertwined with the wood’s own scent.

She had seen nothing like it before.

Was it grafted? Like the wood she had once sourced in Silverpine Valley?

But in this industry, suppliers guarded their sources fiercely. They wouldn’t disclose where they obtained such unique materials—not to a stranger, at least.

Evelyn couldn’t ask outright.

So she had placed a private order, requesting this specific wood.

And now, the young man’s reaction confirmed it—this wood was special.

That was why he had chased after her.

That was why he was so desperate to stop her.
###Chapter 260

Evelyn watched as the young woodcarver's shoulders slumped, his defensive posture melting away like morning frost under sunlight.

"This timber is too precious for practice pieces," she observed, studying the intricate grain patterns. "At most, you could craft one or two small items, never anything substantial." His profile told her everything - the truth shone in his downcast eyes.

"Who said I'm practicing?" Julian Mercer's voice dropped to a whisper. "These are personal creations."

"Then don't strain yourself," Evelyn offered gently. "It's fine if you can't fulfill my request."

Julian's head snapped up. "I'll use different wood for your commission," he conceded after a tense silence. "But this piece stays with me." His fingers curled protectively around the reddish-brown wood.

"Why do you want this scrap anyway?" Suspicion darkened his features as he scrutinized her face.

Evelyn's lips curved knowingly. "That's my business. Nothing sinister, I promise." She tilted her head. "Do we have a deal?"

The standoff lasted several heartbeats. Finally, Julian's grip relaxed. "Fine. A small piece only." His warning glare could have chiseled stone. "No changing your mind later."

"Agreed." Evelyn nodded.

As Julian turned to leave, realization struck. "Wait! I never got your name!"

Sunlight gilded his retreating figure when he paused. "Julian Mercer," floated back to her. The elegant name contrasted sharply with his rough demeanor.

Evelyn resumed walking only when Julian disappeared around the corner. She'd taken barely ten steps when a towering silhouette blocked the narrow alleyway.

Recognition flickered - that chiseled jawline, the expensive wool coat. Lucien Dubois. Dominic Reeves' associate from Silverpine Valley. The foreign perfumer who'd attended the evaluation as VIP guest.

Her stomach tightened. What business could this overseas tycoon have with her?

"Ms. Carter." Lucien's accented voice had improved since their last encounter. His gaze raked over her like a jeweler appraising flawed gemstone.

Evelyn's spine straightened. "Excuse me." Ice coated her words.

Instead of moving, Lucien's hand shot out, blocking her path completely. The gold cufflink at his wrist gleamed ominously.
###Chapter 261

No one could have anticipated Lucien Dubois would be so brazen as to pull such a stunt in broad daylight.

Evelyn Carter seized his wrist with one hand and twisted it with all her strength.

"Ah!" The pain forced a cry from Lucien's lips, yet he didn't retreat.

She had miscalculated—forgotten that foreign men had thicker builds. Her slender fingers barely circled his wrist, and no matter how hard she twisted, she couldn't snap it.

What she didn’t realize was that her resistance only fueled Lucien’s excitement. His blue eyes gleamed with something dangerous. "What a fiery beauty," he murmured, lips curling. "I must admit, I'm quite taken with you."

"Disgusting." Evelyn spat the word and aimed a sharp kick at his abdomen.

This time, Lucien was prepared. He sidestepped, catching her ankle mid-air—only to realize too late that he’d underestimated her.

The moment his fingers closed around her leg, an impossible force yanked him forward.

CRACK.

He hit the ground hard, the impact reverberating through his bones. His wrist, already strained, gave way with an audible snap. "Damn it—!"

Lucien gaped at her, disbelief warring with pain.

How?

This delicate-looking woman—who seemed like she’d struggle lifting a grocery bag—had just flung him like a ragdoll.

No witnesses. No tricks. Just raw, terrifying strength.

Evelyn had no interest in his shock. She turned to leave, boots clicking against the tile, when his voice stopped her.

"Wait—please!"

The word "please" made her pause. She glanced back, icy disdain in her gaze.

Lucien swallowed, forcing a charming smile despite the agony. "You don’t know who I am," he said, "but I know exactly who you are."

Her fingers twitched.

"Evelyn Carter," he continued, pushing himself up with his uninjured hand. "The brilliant perfumer who nearly brought DR Holdings’ fragrance division to its knees. A true artist—unlike Vanessa Blake."

At the mention of her former friend, Evelyn stilled. "Get to the point."

Lucien limped closer, undeterred. "Talent alone isn’t enough," he said, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "You’ve been stagnant for years. Others take credit for your work. Tell me—what’s the use of skill without strategy?"

His smirk widened as he closed the distance between them. "Let me show you how to play the game."
###Chapter 262

"What matters most in today's world? Connections and influence. Do you honestly believe you can succeed without them or a powerful mentor? Sure, your new fragrance was a hit, but what happens when doors start closing? Do you really think they'd let an outsider win the annual Perfume Championship?" Lucien Dubois sneered, his voice dripping with condescension.

Evelyn Carter met his gaze with icy detachment. "Get to the point."

His lips curled into what he thought was a charming smile, though the pain from his earlier injuries made it more of a grimace. "A woman as clever as you should recognize opportunity when it's right in front of her. I'm offering you a chance. The choice is yours."

Evelyn glanced around mockingly. "Funny. I don’t see any opportunities here."

"Aww," Lucien cooed, stepping closer—so close he could reach out and touch her. "Sometimes you just need to look in the right place. This time, your chance is standing right before you. All you have to do is—OW! OW!"

Before he could finish, Evelyn seized his uninjured arm and twisted it sharply.

Crack.

This time, it wasn’t a fracture—just a clean dislocation.

"You—you witch!" Lucien howled, his facade of charm shattering. "Who the hell do you think you are? Mark my words, I’ll ruin you in this industry. You’ll never work as a perfumer again!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Is that so?" She took a deliberate step forward.

Lucien scrambled back, panic flashing in his eyes. "Stay away! Don’t you dare—!"

She let her gaze drift pointedly downward. With both arms now useless—one fractured, the other dislocated—his legs were the only things keeping him upright.

A cold sweat broke out on his forehead. "I-I’m a judge for the championship! If you lay a hand on me, I’ll—"

He didn’t wait to finish. Spinning on his heel, he bolted.

Evelyn exhaled, rolling her shoulders to ease the tension. She hadn’t intended to hurt him badly—just enough to make him think twice before harassing her again.

What a disgrace.

How someone like Lucien Dubois could be considered a respected perfumer was beyond her. No wonder Alexander Kensington had warned her to stay away from him.

But the real problem wasn’t over yet.
###Chapter 263

Lucien Dubois rushed to the nearest hospital to treat his injuries. He was making a scene, howling in pain as the nurses tended to him. By the time Vanessa Blake arrived, his dislocated arm had been reset, and the doctor had fitted him with a cast for his fractured wrist, which gave him an almost comical appearance. His face was already a mess from the fight with Dominic Reeves, and now his arms were out of commission too. He sat there, seething in silence.

"Are you okay?" Vanessa asked, though she already knew the answer.

Since he had demanded she come immediately, she figured she might as well play the concerned friend. She offered to cover his medical expenses and helped him out of the hospital, which seemed to improve his mood slightly.

"How did you even end up like this? You looked like you were holding your own against Dominic earlier," she remarked as she guided him into the car.

Once settled, he jerked his chin toward the seatbelt, silently commanding her to buckle him in. Vanessa sighed but obliged.

When she finished, she asked, "Back to the hotel?"

"Should I just follow you home instead?" he snapped irritably.

Vanessa didn’t respond and started the car. She knew better than to engage with him when he was in this state. But Lucien wasn’t one to stay quiet for long. He clumsily opened a pack of cigarettes with his teeth, pulled one out, and lit it with his good hand. After a few deep drags, he finally relaxed.

"You went to the hospital?" Lucien asked suddenly.

Vanessa kept her eyes on the road. "Obviously. How else would I have picked you up?"

"You know that’s not what I meant," he muttered, exhaling smoke. "He’s not dead, is he?"

Vanessa pressed her lips together before answering. "No. A few broken ribs, but he’ll live. Just needs time to recover."

"Then he’s fine," Lucien said with a dismissive shrug. "Who the hell does he think he is, hitting me like that?"

"You hit him back just as hard," Vanessa pointed out. "And from what I saw, you had the advantage." She hesitated before adding, "I’m still his fiancée, you know."

Lucien narrowed his eyes in disgust. "So what? I never had any intention of stealing his precious fiancée. I’m not looking to marry you or start a family. What’s wrong with keeping things casual?"

Vanessa had no response. Lucien was unpredictable, his actions often defying logic. She sighed. "You and him… and Genevieve Sinclair are still on decent terms, right? She’s the one who asked you for a favor, and now you’ve gone and done this to her son—"

"He started it!" Lucien whined, unrepentant. "Besides, Genevieve and I aren’t friends. We’re business partners. I owed her a favor, and I repaid it. That’s it."

By the time he finished speaking, his cigarette was half gone. Vanessa finally understood the nature of their relationship. He wasn’t Genevieve’s ally—just someone she had sent to assist Dominic. Lucien had been the perfect choice because he owed her and had no conflicting interests with Dominic.
###Chapter 264

The car was thick with tension as both occupants sank into their own thoughts.

Lucien suddenly erupted in fury, his face twisting with irritation. He violently rolled down the window and flicked his half-smoked cigarette onto the pavement.

Vanessa glanced sideways but kept her mouth shut, focusing on navigating through traffic.

"Why the hell didn't you warn me that woman knew martial arts?" Lucien spat through clenched teeth, his knuckles whitening as he gripped his injured arm.

Vanessa's brows knitted in genuine confusion. When she met his dangerous glare, she nearly swerved the car. "I... I don't understand. Who are you talking about? What martial arts?"

"Evelyn Carter!" The name burned in his throat like acid. Never in his privileged life had a woman dared lay hands on him. The humiliation still scorched his pride.

Lucien prided himself on understanding women. A few well-placed promises, the right incentives, and they always came willingly. If one approach failed, he simply raised the stakes.

But Evelyn had been different. He'd dangled the championship title, unlimited resources, industry connections - yet she'd responded with her fists. The memory made his fractured arm throb anew.

Vanessa's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "Evelyn? Our Evelyn?" She shook her head slightly. "There must be some mistake. What kind of fighting are we talking about?"

"How should I know?" Lucien snapped. "Weren't you college friends? You'd know if she had combat training!"

Vanessa's mind reeled. The Evelyn she knew couldn't even win an argument, let alone a physical confrontation. She moistened her suddenly dry lips. "You're telling me... Evelyn Carter... the perfumer I've worked with for years... did this?" Her eyes darted to his cast.

"Are you questioning my account?" Lucien's voice dropped dangerously low.

"No! Of course not!" Vanessa backpedaled quickly. "It's just... completely unbelievable. How could I not know something like this about her?"

"You truly had no idea?" His eyes narrowed suspiciously.

Vanessa raised her right hand like taking an oath. "I swear, Lucien. I've known her since university - never once saw her raise a hand to anyone. She couldn't even win a perfume competition without help." She hesitated. "Are you absolutely certain it was Evelyn?"

The car filled with suffocating silence as Lucien's jaw worked. The truth was, he'd never forget those cold, calculating eyes - or the precise way she'd dismantled him. That woman was no ordinary perfumer. And that made her infinitely more dangerous.
###Chapter 265

"That can't be true!" Lucien insisted, his voice sharp with disbelief.

"Just wait," Vanessa said, pulling into the hotel parking lot. She grabbed her phone and pulled up a photo of Evelyn.

Even though they had met in Silverpine Valley, it had been years. There was a chance Lucien had simply mistaken someone else for her. "It's definitely her. You really had no idea?" Lucien's expression darkened with confusion as Vanessa sighed. "Guess I need to get reacquainted with Evelyn."

When Evelyn returned home, she carefully placed the two wooden puppets in the display cabinet in the living room. Then, she wrapped the remaining piece of wood in paper before heading to the shower.

She hadn’t been in a hurry to wash up, but after touching that disgusting man, she wanted to scrub every trace of him off her skin. Evelyn hadn’t wanted to waste time arguing with Lucien, but now, replaying his words in her mind, she understood exactly what he’d been implying.

Apparently, Lucien was one of the judges for the upcoming championship—and he’d outright vowed to block her from competing. His threats weren’t empty. Either he had the power to do it, or he had a way to make it happen.

The organizers had already announced the judging panel, so it wasn’t surprising he knew about it. Worse, he’d been invited as a special judge for the sampling event, meaning he held influence in the industry. What a joke—someone so respected was nothing but trash.

After her shower, Evelyn slipped into comfortable loungewear and wandered into the kitchen. Alexander had suggested she avoid cooking, but he’d thoughtfully stocked a snack cabinet so she wouldn’t go hungry.

Opening it, she found most of her favorite treats.

A small smile tugged at her lips. He knew her so well. Just thinking about Alexander made warmth bloom in her chest. She grabbed a few snacks and set them on the coffee table before brewing a pot of fruity tea. The sweet, citrusy aroma filled the room, and she settled onto the sofa, flipping on the TV.

In the past, she’d been too busy with work to indulge in simple pleasures. But Alexander had taught her the importance of balance—how to slow down and enjoy life.

And she’d realized something: taking breaks actually helped her work. It let her notice the beauty around her, sparking new inspiration when she least expected it.

At that moment, the TV happened to be airing a drama about a rigged beauty pageant. The protagonist, a talented contestant, was repeatedly passed over for the win—all because she’d refused to sleep with one of the judges.

The storyline hit too close to home. The corrupt judge in the show bore an unsettling resemblance to Lucien.

Was that what he wanted from me?

Back in Silverpine Valley, he’d been with Vanessa, and Victoria had hinted they’d been involved. Had they slept together? Was that why Dominic had ended up in that strange accident?

The pieces clicked together, leaving Evelyn stunned.

But one thing still didn’t make sense.

If Lucien already had Vanessa, why had he come after her?

Was it greed?

Or did he have another scheme in play?
###Chapter 266

Evelyn was lost in contemplation when Alexander arrived home unnoticed. The setting sun cast golden rays through the windows, illuminating her slender legs stretched across the sofa. A half-eaten bag of chips rested in one hand while another piece hovered near her parted lips.

Though the television played softly in the background, Evelyn's unfocused gaze betrayed her distraction. She didn't register Alexander's approach until he knelt before her, his lips parting expectantly.

Snapping back to reality, Evelyn reacted with lightning speed. She popped the chip into her mouth with a triumphant grin. "Too slow, darling! Mmm, delicious!"

Her laughter filled the room, but Alexander had other plans. In one fluid motion, he captured her lips, stealing the remaining half of the snack with a playful bite. Not content with just the chip, he traced the salty crumbs at the corner of her mouth with his tongue. "Even better this way," he murmured.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed at her husband's boldness. Before she could protest, Alexander swept her into his arms, settling her comfortably on his lap. "Tell me, my love," he whispered against her temple, "what had you so preoccupied? Surely you were thinking of me?"

'This man's ego knows no bounds,' Evelyn thought, tightening her arms around his neck in mock fear. "And if I wasn't? Would you drop me right here?"

"Never," Alexander promised, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "But I'd need to understand why my wife's thoughts wander when I think of nothing but her."

Evelyn rolled her eyes at his smooth words. "I do think of you," she admitted, "but other matters demand attention too. Isabella and I lunched today - we're planning a beach trip before winter sets in."

Alexander nodded approvingly. "Victoria mentioned submitting your competition entry. Preliminary results should arrive after our return." His fingers traced idle patterns on her arm. "Then you can focus on your new project with peace of mind."

"You remembered?" Evelyn's eyes sparkled with surprise.

"How could I forget?" He raised an eyebrow. "Already have fresh inspiration?"

"Just the beginnings of an idea," she confessed, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "It's experimental, but I want to try something different."

Alexander's smile held nothing but encouragement. "Take the risk. Even if it fails, the experience will be valuable."

"My brilliant husband," Evelyn sighed, resting her head against his shoulder. "Great minds truly think alike."

Alexander's grip tightened slightly. "Say that again," he demanded, his voice suddenly rough.

"Great minds think alike?" Evelyn repeated, confused.

"Before that," he insisted, turning her face toward his. The intensity in his gaze made her pulse quicken.

Evelyn felt heat creeping up her neck as realization dawned. "My... brilliant husband?" she whispered, suddenly breathless.

Alexander's answering smile could have melted glaciers. "That's the one." His lips found hers again, sealing the words between them like a promise.
###Chapter 267

"I need to use the restroom." Evelyn tried to slip away, but Dominic wasn’t about to let her escape so easily. His arms tightened around her, pulling her closer.

"Not yet," he murmured, his voice low and teasing. "Repeat what you said first. Then you can go."

"I really need to go!" Her earlier words had been a slip of the tongue, and now embarrassment burned through her.

"If you truly need to go, then say it quickly. It’s just one sentence." Dominic leaned in until their noses brushed, his gaze locking onto hers. His voice softened, laced with affection. "Say it again, love."

"I—I—" Evelyn’s cheeks flamed, her heart pounding so hard she thought it might burst. She shoved against his chest, sitting up straight and planting her hands on her hips. "I said, my husband! Is there a problem with that?!"

Her tone was defiant, but her nerves betrayed her. Her face burned like the last embers of sunset.

"None at all." Dominic grinned, his satisfaction evident. "In fact, I’m proud you have such a husband."

Evelyn huffed and turned away, stepping onto the floor. "I’m going!" She took a few steps before pausing abruptly. "Oh, right!"

"Yes?"

"Do you know Lucien Dubois?" She wondered if Dominic might recognize the name—his network was vast, after all.

"No, never heard of him. Who is he?" Dominic frowned slightly, shaking his head after a moment of thought.

Evelyn hadn’t expected that. "Just someone in the industry. A perfumer. I didn’t think you’d know him since you’re not from that world."

Dominic watched her disappear into the bathroom, her words lingering in his mind. Not from that world? It felt like a subtle dismissal, and it irked him.

His gaze drifted to the two new wooden figurines on the shelf—delicate, hand-carved, their expressions joyful. He picked one up, inhaling the faint, earthy scent of the wood.

When Evelyn returned, she caught him examining them and beamed. "Do you like them? I have good taste, don’t I?"

"They’re well-made. A boy and a girl." Dominic nodded, his tone thoughtful.

"Exactly! The craftsmanship is incredible—every detail, even their expressions. And the wood itself is unusual. I found them in a little shop today. The scent was unique, nothing like ordinary wood. I was thinking… maybe there’s potential for a new fragrance line."

She spoke excitedly, oblivious to the shift in Dominic’s focus.

"Perfect," he murmured, turning the figurines in his hands before glancing back at her. "Why didn’t you tell me you were thinking about this?"

"About what?" She blinked, assuming he meant the fragrance idea. "Oh, it just came to me this afternoon. It’s only a rough concept—I haven’t figured out how to execute it yet."

Before she could finish, Dominic grabbed her wrist and yanked her close. "Execution is simple," he said, his voice dropping. "We can start now."

He bent to kiss her, but Evelyn pressed her hands against his chest. "What are you doing?!"

"Putting it into action." His grin was wicked. "If you’ve thought about it, we should try. Maybe not two at once, but we can take our time. Either way, effort is required."
###Chapter 268

Evelyn's mind went blank. She gaped at him for a long moment before his words finally registered.

She smacked his arm. "You're insane!"

"Ow!" Alexander winced dramatically. "I know I messed up, and you have every right to bring it up. But it's not too late for us to start working on it now."

"Since when did I say that?" Evelyn was at a loss for words. "When did I ever mention wanting a baby with you? Huh? When?"

She couldn’t recall a single instance where she’d brought up children. Why was he suddenly talking about this? He could fantasize all he wanted—alone!

Alexander released his hold on her and reached for the wooden dolls he’d set aside earlier. He dangled them in front of her face. "You bought these to hint that you want a son and a daughter, didn’t you?"

Evelyn was speechless.

Why does his brain work like this? I can’t deal with him!

"That’s not what I meant! I was just walking around, saw a woodcarving shop, and thought these were cute. That’s it! You’re reading way too much into it!"

Hopefully, that cleared things up. No more misunderstandings.

For a brief second, Alexander looked crestfallen. Then he nodded. "Got it."

Evelyn immediately felt a pang of guilt. Had she been too harsh? Should she have softened her words? Was he actually… excited about the idea of kids? She’d never even considered it herself.

Before she could dwell on it, Alexander spoke again. "Doesn’t matter. Even if you weren’t thinking about it before, you can start now. What do you say?"

"Alex!" she snapped. "Get. Lost!"

She rarely raised her voice, but this man was testing her limits. All that guilt she’d felt a second ago? Wasted. He was already ten steps ahead, planning their imaginary future.

Let him dream. Alone.

The hospital was quiet, visiting hours long over. Most patients were asleep—except one.

Dominic had been moved to a private VIP ward after his car accident. Despite the excellent care, sleep eluded him. He lay there, staring at the stars outside his window, lost in thought.

The doorbell chimed twice before the door swung open. A broad-shouldered bodyguard stepped in first, scanning the room to confirm Dominic was alone. Satisfied, he turned and nodded to someone outside.

A woman in an oversized black trench coat, a long scarf, and oversized sunglasses strode in. She stopped at the foot of the bed, watching him.

Dominic didn’t turn. He acted as if he hadn’t noticed her.

After a tense silence, she removed her sunglasses.

"Nate."
###Chapter 269

Dominic Reeves still refused to speak to Genevieve Sinclair, and she could only sigh. "If you're unwilling to talk to me, I'll just go."

"I see. You'd be so indifferent even after your son was in an accident," Dominic finally spoke, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

"Didn't I come here to see you?" she snapped.

"Yeah! It must've been such an inconvenience to fit me into your busy schedule." He had never been this disrespectful to his mother before, but Dominic was seething, and she was the only one he could lash out at.

When people hit rock bottom, they usually had someone to lean on—but Dominic had no one.

"Dominic! How dare you speak to me like that?" Genevieve's tone turned sharp. "You know exactly how hard my life has been all these years, yet I've always done everything I could to help you. Ask yourself—haven't I always been there when you needed me? Yes, this time, I made a mistake. But that doesn't give you the right to treat me this way!"

Dominic immediately sobered under her reprimand. He turned to look at her. She was still elegant, still poised. Even in her later years, with faint lines marking her face, she carried herself with grace. It was clear she had lived well after remarrying.

"Mother, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have spoken to you like that," he muttered.

Genevieve exhaled in resignation. "It's fine. I know you're upset because of your injuries. And I saw the news report about your accident—that street wasn't narrow at all, and it was empty when it happened. How could you have been hit by a car?"

Dominic didn’t answer. Instead, he asked, "Mother, what’s your relationship with Lucien Dubois?"

Genevieve stiffened. "Why do you ask?"

"Just curious. You were the one who introduced him to me, after all," Dominic replied carefully.

"I met him by chance. I helped him once, and he owed me a favor. When I heard you were in trouble, I brought him in because of his reputation abroad. Did something happen because of him?" She pieced the timeline together quickly.

"You're saying you barely knew him, that he wasn’t a friend—yet you still sent him my way?" Dominic pressed, his tone edged with accusation.

Genevieve’s expression darkened. "What are you implying? Are you blaming me for this? I introduced him to help you clean up your mess. Was he not useful? Did he not have the skills? Why does it matter if he was a friend or not, as long as he could help?"

"Oh, he was helpful, all right," Dominic scoffed bitterly. "He even helped my fiancée with her needs."

Lucien had been introduced by his mother—and had ended up in bed with Vanessa Blake.

Dominic should have stopped them from going to Silverpine Valley together. Silverpine Valley. The realization hit him like a truck. Lucien had been interested in Vanessa from the start. Dominic had sensed something off back then and tried to keep Vanessa away, but she hadn’t listened. They had been sneaking around behind his back for who knew how long.

And he had been the biggest fool—flying all the way there to protect her when she was alone in Silverpine Valley.
###Chapter 270

Dominic's stomach churned at the mere thought of Vanessa and Lucien together. Every time she wasn't by his side, she was with him. The disgust was almost unbearable.

Evelyn arched a brow at Dominic's revelation. "Vanessa Blake?"

"Do I have another fiancée I don't know about?" he shot back, voice dripping with sarcasm.

Evelyn didn’t miss a beat. "Could’ve fooled me. Last I checked, you were juggling two."

Dominic fell silent, jaw clenched.

Evelyn didn’t press further. Instead, she leaned in, eyes sharp. "So you’re telling me Vanessa slept with Lucien? Right under your nose?"

Her bluntness made Dominic flush crimson. "Mother!" he snapped, mortified.

"Oh, please." She waved a hand. "If you’re already humiliated, why stop now?" Her gaze hardened. "Are you blaming me for introducing Lucien to you?"

Dominic had been furious at first, but as the initial shock faded, he knew it wasn’t her fault. No one could’ve predicted this. Besides, Lucien had helped DR Holdings survive its crisis.

"No," Dominic muttered. "I don’t blame you."

Evelyn nodded, satisfied. "At least you still have some sense. I’d be livid if you did." She exhaled sharply. "Dominic, I’ve always said that woman wasn’t right for you. She wasn’t the type to stand by you through hardship."

She leaned back, crossing her arms. "Even without Lucien, she would’ve left you for the next man who caught her eye. Be grateful you found out now—before you married her."

Evelyn wasn’t surprised by Vanessa’s betrayal. She’d disliked her from the start but kept quiet because Dominic loved her. At least now he saw her for who she really was.

"But—" Dominic hesitated, "she’s carrying my child."

Despite everything, he still cared for Vanessa. They’d been together for years. How could he just walk away?

Evelyn scoffed. "Your child? Are you sure about that? With her track record, do you really believe her?"

Dominic stiffened. He had considered the possibility, but— "It’s not possible. She was already pregnant when she met Lucien. The baby has to be mine."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Even if it’s not Lucien’s, how do you know it’s not someone else’s? She’s a flirt, Dominic. Who knows what she’s capable of? She might not even be pregnant!"

Her words were knives, each one cutting deeper. "And even if it is yours, do you really want a woman like her as the mother of your child? What would people say?"

She sighed, shaking her head. "If only you’d listened to me and chosen Evelyn instead, none of this would’ve happened."

Dominic’s expression darkened. "I told you not to bring her up." His voice dropped. "She didn’t even bother visiting me in the hospital. How is she any better?"
###Chapter 271

Dominic had thought about Evelyn when the news about his identity came out. Even his mother Genevieve had gone to visit him. He knew there was no way Evelyn wouldn't know about his identity. Still, she didn't show up, and Vanessa was the one who went to see him when the news first appeared on TV.

Genevieve only smirked coldly at her shameless son, "Visit you? If I were Evelyn, I'd have torn you to pieces after what you did to her. The nerve!"

"Mother! Am I not your son?" Dominic snapped.

How could she be siding with an outsider?

"I'm saying this to you because you're my son, or else why should I care?!" She finished. Genevieve noticed the apparent change in her son's facial expression, and her tone softened, "It's not that I'm trying to reprimand you. I'm just trying to give you constructive criticism. I've met many people, and I know Vanessa is unsuitable for you."

"Then what does this have to do with Evelyn? Is it because she's a talented perfumer? I'm looking for a wife, not a perfumer. Besides, did you see how she's seeking revenge? Isn't Evelyn a scary woman as well?" Dominic refuted unconvincingly.

In his heart, he knew very well that being with Evelyn was better than Vanessa. When Dominic was still with Evelyn, he didn't have to worry about their company's new products because she always came up with fresh ideas suitable for their perfume market. He also wouldn't have to worry about perfume forms or the shortage of resources, as Evelyn would always solve them.

Dominic was so ignorant of his job that he didn't know that a single mistake in a form could destroy the company. Although he and Evelyn lived separately, there were always hearty home-cooked meals waiting for him when he visited. Vanessa, on the other hand, never cooked. She was too worried that the oil and smoke would damage her skin and reduce the sensitivity of her fingers.

Honestly, Evelyn was the ideal wife, but she lacked appeal. She would always be too focused on her experiments and ignore Dominic's phone calls. Sometimes, when he found her attractive and wanted to kiss her, the lingering smell of chemical substances on Evelyn would turn him off.

Vanessa wasn't like that, as she always possessed a scent that could intoxicate him. Vanessa was also a vixen in bed, and after being with Vanessa for a more extended period, he started to lose interest in Evelyn and found her unappealing.

"You..." Genevieve sighed and brought a chair over as she was tired of standing. She looked at Dominic and said, "How long has Evelyn been together with you? Why didn't she seek revenge before? Why did she choose to do it now? Are you sure you're unaware of the cause?"

"I don't care what happened, but since you're a grown adult, you should know how to deal with your problems. However, Dom, your taste in women is horrible! If my memories serve me right, Vanessa is from a working-class family, right? Her parents are just regular folks," Genevieve asked.

It was true that Vanessa was from a working-class family, but he didn't care much about it. In his opinion, a capable man would be able to provide for his wife and make her happy. He didn't want to be a man that had to rely on a woman. Besides, Evelyn was also from a working-class family.

"Although Vanessa's family might not be rich, they're still a normal family, and I've seen Vanessa's parents too! I've never once seen or heard Evelyn talk about her family after all these years together! For all you know, she might be an orphan! How is her family better than Vanessa's?"

Dominic had tried asking Evelyn about her family, but whenever he brought this up, she avoided talking about it. After some time, Dominic just assumed she was an orphan, so she chose not to talk about it. Hence, he just let this topic slide.

Genevieve could only stare at her son like he was the biggest idiot in the world. She couldn't understand why he hadn't inherited her intelligence. Instead, he came close to resembling his father's ignorant character.

"An orphan? Ha ha!" Genevieve laughed in irony.
###Chapter 272

Genevieve Sinclair scoffed. "She's no orphan!"

Dominic Reeves blinked in confusion.

Slowly, she continued, "Have you heard of the Hawthorne family in Elmsworth?"

"The Hawthornes?" Dominic frowned. "You mean one of the most powerful families in the country? Rumor has it they practice ancient martial arts and keep to themselves. That Hawthorne family?"

Naturally, he knew of them. The nation had four legendary families—the Worthingtons, Prescotts, Kensingtons, and Hawthornes.

The Hawthornes of Elmsworth were political royalty, producing generations of influential leaders. Their discipline was ironclad, their influence unshakable.

The Prescotts of Garnet Springs and the Kensingtons of Veridian City dominated commerce, each ruling their respective industries. The Worthingtons controlled real estate, while the Kensingtons reigned over entertainment.

Though their domains differed, whispers claimed they maintained close alliances.

Yet the most enigmatic of them all were the Hawthornes. Some said every member was a trained fighter, though they appeared as refined scholars in public. No one could confirm the rumors, but no one in Elmsworth dared cross them.

So why was Genevieve bringing them up now?

Dominic hesitated. "Are you saying Evelyn has ties to the Hawthornes?"

Genevieve's silence spoke volumes.

"Impossible!" Dominic snapped.

"Damn it, you clearly don’t know Evelyn at all. She’s just a gifted perfumer—gentle, delicate. How could she be connected to them? Her last name is Carter, for God’s sake!"

He refused to believe it. He’d known Evelyn since university. If she had ties to the Hawthornes, he would’ve noticed.

This has to be a mistake.

Genevieve only laughed. "Surnames mean nothing. I’m a Sinclair, you’re a Reeves—yet here we are."

"That’s different. You’re my—" He froze mid-sentence.

"Wait… are you saying—?"

Exactly. Different names didn’t mean no relation.

A cold realization settled over him. Does Evelyn know martial arts? That night in the alley, she moved like a shadow—even held a knife to my throat. The memory sent a chill down his spine.

Could Evelyn really be a Hawthorne?
###Chapter 273

The afternoon light was fading when Evelyn finished speaking. She rose from the chair beside Dominic's hospital bed, smoothing her skirt. "We'll continue this conversation after you've recovered," she said firmly. "For now, focus on healing."

As she turned to leave, a sudden thought made her pause. She glanced back over her shoulder. "Oh, and forget about Vanessa." Her tone left no room for argument.

Dominic remained silent. The room plunged into stillness, the only sound the rhythmic beeping of medical equipment.

The next morning, Vanessa arrived bearing a thermos of soup and freshly baked pastries from Magnolia Grove's finest bakery. Since the accident, they'd fallen into an uneasy routine - she played the dutiful caretaker, he tolerated her presence. Neither mentioned their fractured past, maintaining a fragile ceasefire that felt more ominous than peaceful.

Vanessa went through her usual motions - feeding him breakfast, tidying the bedside table, helping him wash up. Only when these tasks were completed did she settle into the visitor's chair, clearing her throat.

"I visited DR Holdings yesterday," she began. "Operations are running smoothly. The new hires have adapted well, though the junior perfumers still need more training. We might need additional staff." She delivered the corporate update with practiced efficiency.

Dominic nodded. "I reviewed the organizational chart adjustments you emailed. Good work." His compliment was professional, detached. The mention of restructuring brought unwelcome memories, making his jaw tighten.

Vanessa recognized the shift. She didn't press. "Just doing my job. The company comes first." Every word emphasized her indispensable role at DR Holdings - and by extension, in his life. The unspoken message: You can't dismiss me.

A tense silence followed. Vanessa rummaged in her purse, popping a piece of mint gum into her mouth. "By the way," she said casually, "Phoenix Labs submitted their entry for the annual competition."

"Expected," Dominic replied flatly. He suspected she was filling airtime to avoid uncomfortable silences.

"Interesting that Evelyn prepared the formula herself. Does Celestia Group really trust her that much?"

Dominic's patience frayed. "Get to the point, Vanessa."

Perhaps his mother's words had gotten to him. Suddenly, Vanessa's circuitous approach grated on his nerves. Why couldn't she just say what she meant?

"I'm just... surprised," Vanessa continued, gazing at the ceiling. "Since leaving DR Holdings, Evelyn's transformed completely. Who knew she had this in her? Joining Phoenix Labs, gaining real influence..." She shook her head. "What's her secret?"

Dominic didn't respond, but the question lingered. How had Evelyn - no Hawthorne family connections, no powerful backers - landed at a prestigious subsidiary like Phoenix Labs? Celestia Group's standards were notoriously high.

The mystery of Evelyn Carter deepened.
###Chapter 274

The treatment at Phoenix Labs might not be top-tier, but it was a coveted position in the industry.

After all, staying at Phoenix Labs meant climbing the corporate ladder within the Celestia Group. With luck, one could even reach mid-management. So how had Evelyn Carter gotten in so quickly?

Judging by earlier events, not only had Evelyn secured her place, but her new colleagues were fiercely protective of her too.

Vanessa Blake received no response from Dominic Reeves. She studied him and asked, "By the way, you’ve known her for a while. Did you know Evelyn practices kickboxing?"

"Evelyn knows kickboxing?" Dominic’s brows shot up. "Who told you that?"

Vanessa’s surprise deepened at his reaction—his question wasn’t How could that be? but Who told you? That subtle difference confirmed her suspicions. Evelyn did know kickboxing.

But how had she not known? If Dominic was aware, Vanessa should have been too!

"How long have you known?" she pressed.

Dominic shook his head. "I’m not entirely sure. Why do you ask?"

"I—" She hesitated. She couldn’t exactly admit that Evelyn had beaten up Lucien Dubois. If Dominic found out Lucien had been injured, he’d probably laugh—but then the conversation might circle back to why Evelyn had attacked him.

Vanessa bit her lip. "Someone mentioned it, but I didn’t believe them. I’ve known her for years, and she never once mentioned martial arts. She never trained in Taekwondo or karate, right?"

She narrowed her eyes. "And what do you mean, you’re not sure? Have you seen her fight?"

"I’ve seen her in action," he admitted vaguely. "But I don’t know if it was kickboxing specifically."

"When did you see it?" Vanessa pressed, though she could already guess.

If it wasn’t true, why would Lucien and Dominic both believe it? Lucien’s injuries were real—he’d been thoroughly thrashed, and he’d identified Evelyn without hesitation.

This wasn’t as simple as she’d thought.

"Do you remember that press conference?" Dominic finally said after a pause. "The one where we demanded she publicly apologize to debunk the rumors, but she backed out last minute."

Vanessa nodded. "I left early that day."

"Yeah, I followed you out," Dominic admitted. "But I guessed her escape route and took some men to corner her in an alley. In the end—"

"In the end, she beat you up?!" Vanessa gasped.

"Of course not!" he snapped, too quickly.

There was no way he’d admit the humiliating moment Evelyn had pressed a knife to his throat—especially not to Vanessa.

"She took down my bodyguards," he muttered. "I had no choice but to let her go. At the time, I thought they were just incompetent. But looking back… even if they were, she still overpowered multiple men without breaking a sweat."
###Chapter 275

Dominic gave a deliberately vague account of what had happened. The truth was, Evelyn had emerged victorious in spectacular fashion. He had nearly lost his life, and his bodyguards had been beaten so badly they couldn’t even stand. That was precisely why he no longer dared to provoke or lay a hand on her.

Of course, he wasn’t about to go around broadcasting his humiliation. But his mother’s words the previous day had helped him swallow his pride.

If Evelyn had any connection to the Hawthorne family in Elmsworth, everything suddenly made sense. Her mastery of kickboxing, her seamless transition into Phoenix Labs after leaving DR Holdings—none of it would be surprising if the Hawthornes were backing her. Their influence could easily have secured her position.

Vanessa had no idea what he was thinking, let alone the nature of Evelyn’s relationship with the Hawthornes. She was still reeling from the revelation that Evelyn knew kickboxing. Shock, anger, and jealousy twisted inside her. Not only was Evelyn a prodigy in perfumery, but she was also frighteningly skilled in combat.

How could Evelyn so casually disregard Lucien’s status and beat him without consequence, while Vanessa had to tiptoe around him, even enduring his abuse to the point of nearly losing her baby? The injustice of it all burned in her chest.

"I always knew Evelyn wasn’t as innocent as she pretended! She plays the sweet, self-sacrificing flower, but who knows what else she’s hiding? What kind of woman is that good at fighting? It’s practically witchcraft!"

Vanessa pressed on, convinced she was speaking the truth. "Now that I think about it, you’re lucky you got away from her, Dominic. Who knows what other lies she was feeding you?"

In the past, Dominic might have agreed. But now, knowing what he did about Evelyn’s ties to the Hawthornes, he realized just how much she had sacrificed for him—how much she had endured.

With the Hawthornes’ backing, Evelyn could have joined any major corporation. She didn’t need to waste her time in his struggling startup, helping him build it from the ground up. He knew her talent better than anyone. If not for his and Vanessa’s schemes, she would never have been mocked and belittled. She wouldn’t have been driven to despair. Looking back, Dominic saw with painful clarity just how wrong he had been.

When Vanessa accused Evelyn of deception, he couldn’t help but laugh bitterly. He fixed her with a hard stare. "Tell me, Vanessa. What exactly did she lie to me about?"

"She lied to you—"

"Did she steal from me? Play with my emotions?" he pressed.

"Dominic..." Vanessa faltered. She hadn’t expected him to challenge her. His sharp questions left her floundering, unsure how to respond.

"You’ve been by my side for years, Vanessa. You know better than anyone. When Evelyn and I got together, I didn’t even have DR Holdings. Without her perfumes and formulas, there would be no company today. Everything—the houses, the cars—came after. So tell me, what did she lie about?"

Vanessa was stunned. Since when had he become so clear-headed?

"What are you saying? That she was perfect and I’m the liar?"

When she couldn’t refute him, tears sprang to her eyes. "I know you hate me now. You won’t listen to a word I say. Everything I do is wrong. Evelyn was so good to you, sacrificed so much, and now you regret letting her go. You want to run back to her, don’t you? Fine! Go ahead! But tell me—has she even visited you in the hospital? Has she called? Or has she already blocked your number?"

Dominic sighed heavily. "That’s because I hurt her."
###Chapter 276

Dominic had spoken those words. At that moment, Vanessa felt their relationship crumbling before her eyes.

"Fine! If you're so sorry for her, then I'll go!" She rose abruptly, wiping away her tears with the back of her hand. "From now on, you don’t have to worry about the baby or me. I’m leaving!"

She deliberately brought up the child, testing his reaction, hoping to pressure him. But to her shock, her trump card failed.

Dominic’s gaze was icy as he stared at her. "Do you really intend to keep this child, Vanessa?"

Guilt twisted inside her. She had no intention of keeping the baby—she’d already scheduled the abortion in two days. Between her health and her affair with Lucien, she knew this would forever be a wound in Dominic’s heart. She couldn’t let a child chain her down.

The baby was supposed to be her leverage, her bargaining chip—but what if it no longer worked? She couldn’t afford to panic. Swallowing her guilt, she lifted her chin defiantly. "What are you implying? That I faked this pregnancy? Do you have any idea how hard it’s been? I can barely eat or sleep! And yet I’ve still been working for you, for DR Holdings! Who do you think I’m doing all this for?"

Her voice cracked. "I know you still blame me. You hate me. Even though everything I did was for you and the company, you can’t forgive me. Isn’t that right?" Tears spilled over as she glared at him. "Fine. I get it. If you can’t move past this, then we’re done. I won’t hold you back. Go back to your precious ex. But don’t come crying to me later!"

With that, she spun on her heel and marched toward the door.

She took slow, deliberate steps, waiting—praying—for him to stop her.

And then, just before she reached the threshold, his voice cut through the silence.

"Vanessa."

She froze. A small, triumphant smile curled her lips—until his next words shattered it.

"I’m sorry."

Her breath hitched. She whirled around, eyes wide with disbelief. "What did you just say? What do you mean you’re sorry?" She had expected him to cave, to pull her into his arms and whisper reassurances like he always did. She knew him better than anyone—knew exactly how to manipulate his heart.

But this? This wasn’t part of the script.

Panic surged through her. She rushed back to his bedside, grabbing his hand desperately. "No, no—don’t say that, Dominic! You have nothing to apologize for. I didn’t mean to push you. I’d do anything for you. I don’t want to lose you." Her voice trembled. "I know I hurt you, and I regret it more than anything. Can’t we just forget it ever happened? I swear it won’t again!"

She pressed his palm against her stomach, her eyes pleading. "We have a future. We have this baby. We’ll be happy, won’t we?"
###Chapter 277

Dominic wrenched his hand free from Vanessa's grasp with a sharp exhale.

"It's over, Vanessa. We both know there's no returning to what we once had. Starting fresh isn't an option anymore." His voice was firm, his gaze dropping pointedly to her stomach.

"We should consider terminating this pregnancy."

Vanessa recoiled as if struck. This wasn't the Dominic she knew—the man who adored children, who had once cradled her belly with tender anticipation. Now, he spoke of abortion with chilling detachment. It wasn't just the child he was rejecting—it was her.

But Vanessa refused to let him dictate the end. If anyone was walking away, it would be on her terms. After all she'd sacrificed—years of her youth, her ambitions—how dare he be the one to sever their bond?

"Fine. But if I do keep it," she hissed, "you'll pay every cent of child support. Though..." She paused, meeting his hardened stare. "You don’t actually believe I want this, do you?"

His unwavering eyes made her skin prickle. Guilt flickered in her chest, but it was drowned out by resentment.

"Dominic Reeves, you’re heartless."

"We’ve come this far, Vanessa. I won’t deny my mistakes—but don’t pretend yours don’t exist." His voice turned razor-sharp. "Did you think I’d never uncover what you did to Evelyn?"

The accusation hung between them. He’d always known, hadn’t he? He’d simply chosen blindness, wrapped in his obsession with Vanessa. Now, clarity was brutal. His mother had been right—his judgment in women was catastrophically flawed. The only question left was whether it was too late to mend the damage.

"So that’s it?" Vanessa’s laugh was jagged. "You regret me? Regret choosing me over Evelyn? Admit it!"

Dominic didn’t flinch. "Yes."

The word was a guillotine.

"I regret it all. I failed Evelyn. And now, I’ve failed you too." His voice softened, but the resolve didn’t waver. "I can’t give you what you need. Let’s end this before we destroy each other completely."

Vanessa stared at him like he’d sprouted horns. "This isn’t you. Who got to you?" Her nails dug into her palms. "Was it Evelyn? Did she slither back into your life?"

It was the only explanation. Why else would Dominic dredge up the past? That witch. First Lucien, now Dominic. She’s stealing everything from me.

Dominic exhaled impatiently. "This has nothing to do with her. Stop deluding yourself."

But Vanessa was beyond reason. Rage twisted her delicate features into something feral.

"Fine, Dominic. If this is how you want it—remember, I’m the one leaving you. Go crawl back to Evelyn. But mark my words—you’ll beg for me once you realize what you’ve lost!"

She stormed out, heels cracking like gunshots against the floor. Only when silence swallowed the sound did Dominic sag against the wall. The relief was staggering.

Would he regret this? Perhaps. But not as deeply as he already regretted letting Evelyn go.

The next time Evelyn visited the woodcarving shop, the young apprentice was gone. Only the old owner remained, his chisel scraping quietly against oak.
###Chapter 278

"Hey, you're here," the shop owner greeted Evelyn warmly.

Evelyn nodded and pulled out the design she had prepared earlier but didn't hand it over. "Where's the boy?"

"Oh, him?" The owner chuckled.

"He hasn't shown up for the past two days. No idea what's going on—he won't even answer his phone. If he doesn't come in tomorrow, I'm firing him. Kids these days are so unreliable."

Two days missing? Evelyn frowned before asking, "I thought he'd been working here for a while?"

The owner shook his head. "Who told you that? He's only been here a couple of months. I only kept him because he had decent carving skills. With me being busy lately and no one to watch the shop, I let him stay. But look at him now—vanished without a word!"

As he spoke, he suddenly brightened. "Oh, don't worry. We won't mess up your piece. Even if he's gone, I'll find you a proper craftsman to do it right!"

"Do you have his number?" Evelyn wasn't interested in replacements.

"Yeah, but he won't pick up." The owner hesitated before scribbling a number on a scrap of paper. "Here."

Evelyn glanced at it and tucked it into her pocket. She had come to commission this piece for her father’s upcoming birthday.

Even though she wasn’t returning home, she wanted to send a gift. But more importantly, she needed to track down that boy—his knowledge of rare wood was crucial for her research.

She had barely stepped out of the shop when her phone buzzed. Victoria’s name flashed on the screen.

"Where are you?"

"Just browsing," Evelyn replied.

"Get back to the office. Now."

Evelyn blinked. "Right now?"

"Yes, right now. Stop dawdling and grab a cab!" Before hanging up, Victoria added hastily, "It's good news!"

The excitement in her voice was unmistakable, but what could possibly be good? With nothing else to do, Evelyn hailed a cab and headed straight to DR Holdings.

The moment the elevator doors opened on her floor, Victoria was already pacing by the entrance, clearly waiting for her.

"What's going on?" Evelyn asked, bewildered. "Did the company finally decide to give out bonuses?"

"Please. If it were just money, I wouldn’t have dragged you here. You’re way too talented to be this clueless." Victoria grabbed her arm and pulled her forward. "Listen—there’s a new project. And they want you."

"What kind of project is this urgent?"

Before Victoria could answer, they were already at the CEO’s office.

"Ms. Sterling," the secretary greeted them outside, looking unusually serious. Whatever this was, it wasn’t small.

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Victoria, who simply waved the secretary off and marched inside without another word.

Evelyn had no idea what to expect.

Gregory Whitmore, the CEO, was already waiting behind his desk, documents spread out before him. He looked up as they entered, smiling.

"There you are."
###Chapter 279

Evelyn stood frozen, utterly bewildered.

"I'm certain Ms. Sterling hasn't informed you yet," Gregory explained, sliding a violet-embossed invitation across the desk. "Celestia Group received an invitation to the prestigious Laurentia Perfumery Championship. The board has unanimously selected you as our representative."

Evelyn's breath caught. "The biennial Laurentia competition?"

She knew this event well. Held every two years in the perfume capital of Veridia, it sought to identify the most promising new talents in fragrance creation. Established master perfumers were barred from participating to give rising stars their moment in the spotlight.

Naturally, any aspiring perfumer could enter - provided they secured a sponsorship from an industry insider. Most participants were junior or mid-level perfumers hoping to catch the attention of fragrance elites and make their mark.

"Why me?" Evelyn questioned. She was the newest member at Phoenix Labs. Surely more experienced colleagues deserved this chance. The selection felt... politically charged.

Gregory's smile didn't waver. "Because you're our most qualified candidate."

Evelyn studied the gilded invitation, her fingers tracing the raised lettering. Something about this felt orchestrated.

Victoria noticed her hesitation. "What's troubling you? This is a career-making opportunity. The event takes place in Laurentia's perfume district - think of the connections you'll make! When will you get another chance like this?"

"Am I going alone?" Evelyn pressed. She'd never lacked confidence in her abilities. Years of intensive research and countless formula experiments had honed her skills to razor sharpness. The incident from her past... she'd long since proven that wasn't her failure.

Still, the world brimmed with extraordinary talent. While certain of her capabilities, Evelyn remained curious where she truly stood among her peers.

"An assistant will accompany you," Gregory assured.

Evelyn glanced at Victoria. "You're not coming?"

Victoria shook her head. "My schedule's packed with product launches. I can't abandon my responsibilities now."

"Then let me bring Bella," Evelyn suggested, referring to her former lab assistant.

"Absolutely not," Victoria cut in sharply. "Laurentia requires someone experienced with international logistics - accommodations, transportation, coordinating with event staff. Bella lacks those skills."

The explanation made sense. And since this was company policy, Evelyn didn't push further. "When do we depart?"

"Next Wednesday."

"Wednesday?" Evelyn's eyes widened. Today was Friday. That gave her barely four days to prepare.

"But our vacation plans-"

"Will have to wait," Victoria said with an apologetic shrug. "The dates overlap. Consider this an investment in your future. We'll reschedule your holiday for after you return victorious."

Gregory clapped his hands. "Exactly! I expect you'll make us proud. When you come back with that trophy, I'll authorize an extended leave for both of you."

Evelyn nearly rolled her eyes. Victorious? Trophy? He made it sound like she was heading into battle.

As they exited the office, Victoria squeezed Evelyn's shoulder. "This shows how much faith the company has in you. Very few perfumers receive invitations, and even fewer companies qualify to send representatives." Leaning closer, she added in a conspiratorial whisper, "DR Holdings didn't make the cut this year."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow but said nothing. Truthfully, her pulse had quickened with anticipation. This was the proving ground she'd secretly longed for - a chance to measure her skills against the best.

"I'll start preparing immediately," Evelyn said, already mentally reviewing her fragrance formulas. The game was on.
###Chapter 280

The afternoon sun cast long shadows as Evelyn Carter stepped out of the office. With the refrigerator at home nearly empty, she decided to make a quick stop at the supermarket.

There was no rush, so she took her time browsing the aisles, picking up fresh produce and pantry staples. Afterward, she detoured to a renowned patisserie, indulging in a box of delicate pastries before finally hailing a cab.

It was only when she deviated from her usual route that she noticed something—or rather, someone—was off.

Years of self-defense training had sharpened her instincts. The prickle at the back of her neck told her she was being followed.

At first, she dismissed it as paranoia. But after several deliberate turns, the presence remained.

Unease settled in her chest.

Who would tail her? And why?

She gave the driver Sophia Grant’s address instead of her own. She needed to discuss the postponed trip, and besides, she vaguely remembered the way—through a narrow alley that led to the back of the building.

Evelyn slowed her steps as she entered the alley, then abruptly stopped, pretending to adjust her shoelaces.

If they wanted to make a move, now was their chance.

Yet—nothing.

The sensation of being watched persisted, but the pursuer kept a careful distance. No sudden attack, no ambush.

Paparazzi? Unlikely. She wasn’t famous, and few knew about her connection to Alexander Kensington.

Reaching Sophia’s building, she hesitated, trying to recall which floor she lived on. Tired of the game, she decided to call instead.

Then—she acted.

Evelyn spun around, catching her stalker mid-step.

The narrow alley left no room for escape.

"Vanessa?" Shock flickered through her.

No paparazzi would be this clumsy.

"Why are you following me?"

Vanessa Blake flushed, caught red-handed, but quickly masked her embarrassment with defiance. "So what if I am?"

Evelyn stayed silent, refusing to rise to the bait.

Vanessa’s lips twisted. "At least I’m not sneaky and underhanded like you!"

Evelyn blinked.

What was that supposed to mean?
###Chapter 281

"Did you go to Dominic and force him to break up with me?" Vanessa demanded, her voice sharp as shattered glass.

Evelyn blinked, momentarily stunned into silence.

"Stop playing innocent!" Vanessa spat, her lips curling into a sneer. "Just admit what you did. I never thought you’d stoop so low." She kept her distance, wary—she hadn’t forgotten Evelyn’s kickboxing skills.

"Vanessa, have you lost your mind?" Evelyn finally snapped, her patience fraying. "If you’re having delusions, see a therapist. Don’t drag me into your mess. Whatever’s going on between you and Dominic is your problem. Get out of my sight—you make me sick."

With a dismissive flick of her wrist, Evelyn turned away. Vanessa’s face flushed crimson, humiliation burning through her.

"Evelyn, you can’t fool everyone forever!" Vanessa took a slow step forward, her voice dripping with venom. "Do you really think he’d ever take you back? Dream on."

Another step. Closer.

"Even if you’ve blinded him for now, his heart belongs to me. Do you know what we shared while you were rotting in that lab?" Her laugh was cruel. "He told me the sight of you repulsed him. You’re nothing but numbers and test tubes—not even a real woman."

Evelyn’s instincts flared as Vanessa inched nearer. She shifted her stance, ready—but she didn’t strike.

Vanessa lunged.

A sharp cry tore through the air as Vanessa stumbled, clutching her stomach. "Ah—my baby!"

Evelyn froze.

This woman is a snake. Vanessa hadn’t come to fight—she’d come to frame her.

Vanessa could’ve caught herself. But she didn’t. She let herself fall, landing hard against the jagged rock below.

"Nice performance," Evelyn drawled, narrowing her eyes. "But judging by your angle, you hit your waist—not your stomach."

Vanessa’s face twisted in pain, her fingers digging into her abdomen. "You monster!" she wailed. "You killed my child! I’ll make you pay!"

Evelyn opened her mouth to retort—then stopped.

A dark stain spread down Vanessa’s legs.

Blood.

Too real for a prop.

Vanessa was pregnant. And now, she was miscarrying.

She came here knowing the risk? How desperate is she?

"Ah—it hurts!" Vanessa gasped, sweat beading on her forehead. Her agony looked genuine.

The commotion drew a crowd. Bystanders whispered, pointing fingers.

"Vanessa, you’re ruthless," Evelyn muttered under her breath.

Clenching her jaw, she dialed for an ambulance.

A life was at stake. No matter how much she despised Vanessa, she wouldn’t let her bleed out.

And besides—Vanessa still had answers Evelyn needed.

"Evelyn?" A familiar voice cut through the chaos. Sophia rushed down the steps, eyes wide. "What are you doing here? Why didn’t you call—"

A pained moan interrupted her.

Sophia turned—and paled.

"Ms. Blake? What happened?"
###Chapter 282

"Possible miscarriage. An ambulance has been called. They'll be here in about three minutes." Evelyn checked her watch and suppressed the urge to sigh. Today was just not her day. What rotten luck.

Sophia gasped. "Then—"

"It's a hoax," Evelyn snapped.

"Oh." Sophia's expression cleared instantly. She trusted Evelyn completely.

If Evelyn had wanted to hurt Vanessa, she would have done so long ago. There was no way Evelyn would deliberately cause a miscarriage unless Vanessa had provoked her first.

Besides, this wasn’t even the right place for such a stunt.

Vanessa’s breath hitched when she heard Evelyn’s words. She lifted her head, her lips trembling as she bit out, "Evelyn, how dare you slander me! I wouldn’t have fallen if it weren’t for you! Now—ah! It hurts! It hurts!"

Her face twisted in exaggerated pain, but Evelyn wasn’t fooled. People naturally sympathized with the weak, but Evelyn only rolled her eyes.

Slander? Who’s slandering who here?

The ambulance arrived swiftly, and the paramedics loaded Vanessa onto the stretcher. Evelyn had no intention of following, but she made a quick call. Rumors could easily spiral, and she didn’t want Sophia caught in the crossfire, so they both trailed behind.

At the hospital, Vanessa was rushed through a preliminary exam before being wheeled into surgery.

Outside the operating room, Sophia was still reeling. "She was actually pregnant? Then why would she use her pregnancy to cause a scene? What was she trying to achieve?"

"Good question," Evelyn muttered. She wanted to know too.

Was this just another attempt to frame her? But if Vanessa had miscarried because of this, what would she gain?

Evelyn replayed the earlier confrontation in her mind. "Unless I misheard, didn’t she say she broke up with Dominic?"

That’s exactly what it had sounded like.

"Broke up? While she’s pregnant?" Sophia’s eyes widened. She knew exactly how twisted those two were. How could they—so deeply entangled in their toxicity—suddenly split? The world really was full of surprises. A match made in hell should stay in hell.

"I don’t know. Maybe she’s just unhinged and talking nonsense?" Evelyn frowned. If not, why would Vanessa even bring up Dominic and their supposed breakup? The pieces didn’t fit.

"She’s definitely unhinged," Evelyn concluded, tapping her chin thoughtfully. That explanation made the most sense.

A nurse approached. "Are either of you family? We need someone to settle the deposit."

Evelyn and Sophia exchanged glances before shaking their heads in unison.

The nurse hesitated. "But you called the ambulance for her. You’re not related?"

"We’re just good Samaritans," Evelyn said smoothly. "Calling an ambulance is one thing. Paying her hospital bills? No."

She’d rather burn the money than spend it on Vanessa.

The nurse faltered. "Then—"

"Family, right?" Evelyn’s lips curled. "Hold on. Let me make a call."
###Chapter 283

Evelyn pulled out her phone, only to realize she had erased all traces of Dominic from her contacts.

Her gaze flicked to Sophia, the only person who could help now.

Sophia, having worked for Dominic for years, understood instantly. She scrolled through her phone, found his number, and dialed.

The call connected almost immediately. Dominic's voice, laced with amusement, came through. "Sophia? Changed your mind already?"

Silence. Was he seriously this delusional? Evelyn snatched the phone. "Dom."

"Evelyn?" His tone shifted instantly, brightening. "What's going on?"

He checked the caller ID again—Sophia's number. So they were together.

"Your little fling is at Mercy General. OB-GYN wing. Get over here and pay her damn surgery deposit." She rattled off the address and hung up before he could respond.

Sophia blinked, then grinned, giving Evelyn an impressed thumbs-up.

On the other end, Dominic barely registered the past grievances. His mind snagged on one thing—surgery deposit? Who? What surgery? But Evelyn had reached out. That meant there was still a chance.

He could move on his own now, though the wheelchair was a nuisance. The hospital wouldn’t discharge him without assistance, so he called his aide, irritation flaring.

Evelyn only remembered after hanging up—Dominic had been in that car accident. He was still hospitalized. Not her problem. She’d only called out of basic human decency.

She turned to leave, but Sophia’s phone chimed. A transfer notification. Dominic had sent $3,000, along with a message: Whoever it is, cover the costs. I’ll be there soon.

Evelyn and Sophia exchanged a look.

Whoever it is?

How many women did he have on standby?

"Evelyn… what do I do with this?" Sophia stared at the sudden influx of cash.

Evelyn had planned to leave after the call, but now? Taking his money and bolting felt wrong.

"Fine. At least he paid up first," she muttered, changing her mind.

If he was coming, she’d wait. She wanted answers. What game were these two playing?

The deposit was settled quickly. True to his word, Dominic arrived—still in a wheelchair, looking like hell.

He’d considered making himself presentable, but maybe pathetic would work better. Back when they were together, the slightest sniffle had Evelyn fussing over him—tea, medicine, homemade soup.

People never appreciated what they had until it was gone.

From a distance, Dominic studied Evelyn. She looked… different.

Before, she’d been all practicality—minimal makeup, hair in a ponytail, perpetually in a lab coat.

Now? A cashmere sweater hugged her frame, paired with tailored trousers. A trench coat draped effortlessly over her shoulders, her hair loose, waves catching the light. Simple, but undeniably expensive.

The unfamiliarity unsettled him. This wasn’t the reunion he’d imagined.
###Chapter 284

Dominic Reeves stood in the sterile hospital corridor, his mother's words echoing in his mind. For the first time, he saw Evelyn Carter not as the quiet girl he'd once known, but as the most enigmatic and regal member of the Hawthorne family.

"Evelyn." His voice caught as he spoke her name, rough with unspoken tension.

She didn't answer.

"Your woman is still in there," she said coolly, tilting her chin toward the operating room doors. "Save the performance for when she wakes up."

Dominic clenched his jaw.

Beside Evelyn, Isabella Thornton bit back a smirk. She'd never seen Evelyn wield such cutting precision before. It was almost thrilling—watching Dominic struggle to speak, his usual arrogance stripped away.

This material belongs to N?velDrama.Org.

"What happened to Vanessa?" Dominic finally managed, exhaling sharply.

"She followed me," Evelyn replied, her tone detached. "Tried to grab me, lost her footing, and fell." A pause. Then, flatly: "She was bleeding. A lot."

"Miscarriage?"

So he had known about the pregnancy. Evelyn's gaze flickered. "The doctors think so."

A slow breath escaped him—relief, not grief. Not even a flicker of remorse.

Isabella and Evelyn exchanged glances. Cold. Heartless. Was there anything left inside him?

"You said she followed you?" Dominic pressed, as if searching for cracks in her story.

Evelyn arched a brow. "She accused me of forcing you to break up with her. Care to explain why she'd think that, Dominic?"

His expression darkened. He hadn't expected Vanessa to confront Evelyn directly. Clearly, ending things had pushed her over the edge.

Evelyn studied him, silent.

"So you just... pushed her?" he ventured.

Her eyes turned glacial. "I didn't lay a finger on her."

"Fine. You didn't." But the way he said it—doubtful, testing—made her blood run cold. He'd always assumed she was meek. Compliant. Someone who'd endure his neglect without protest.

He'd been wrong.

Dominic stared at her, something raw flickering in his gaze. After a long moment, he murmured, "Even if you had, it wouldn't matter."

Evelyn stiffened. Isabella's lips parted in disbelief.

What kind of man says that? If Vanessa heard him now, she'd shatter all over again.

"I'll say this once more," Evelyn bit out, her voice like winter. "I. Did. Nothing."

The air between them froze solid.
###Chapter 285

The moment Evelyn stepped into the hospital corridor, Dominic visibly stiffened under her piercing gaze. He swallowed hard, nodding repeatedly like a puppet on strings.

"Y-yes, I know you didn't do it," he stammered, fingers twitching at his sides. "Even if you had, it wouldn’t just be a miscarriage. You—" His voice cracked when their eyes met.

"You’ve been through it yourself. I know exactly what you’re capable of."

Evelyn’s lips curled in disdain. She didn’t dignify his words with a response. "Dom, I don’t care what twisted game you and Vanessa are playing. Your petty drama means nothing to me." Her voice was ice. "I brought her here. I called you to handle the bills. That’s the end of it. But if you drag me into your mess again?" A dangerous glint flashed in her eyes. "Don’t blame me for what happens next."

She turned sharply, heels clicking against the linoleum. "Let’s go, Bella."

Just being near them made her skin crawl.

"Wait—Evelyn!" Dominic lunged, fingers grazing her wrist. She jerked away before he could latch on.

His face twisted with something pitiful. "Vanessa and I… we’re over." The words dripped with forced regret. "I don’t know why she came to you. Maybe she couldn’t accept it."

A breath. Then, the performance began.

"But you—you’ve always been in my heart." His voice dropped to a whisper, saccharine and rehearsed. "I regret everything. Let me make it right. Give me one chance."

Bella, lingering by the window, nearly choked.

Is he serious? This isn’t some daytime soap opera.

Evelyn laughed—a sharp, humorless sound. "A chance? Fine." She tilted her head, venom lacing every syllable. "Go public. Admit that I created every award-winning formula DR Holdings stole. Renounce every honor you claimed as yours. Apologize—on your knees, if you have to. Can you do that?"

Silence.

Dominic’s jaw worked. "An apology… a statement, I can do. But the honors?" He hesitated, then scoffed. "Those belong to DR Holdings. You were part of the company. It’s not wrong for us to—"

"Refusing?" Evelyn arched a brow. She’d expected nothing less.

To his credit, he surprised her.

"I’ll do it." His voice hardened with sudden resolve. "On one condition." A calculated pause. "Come back. To DR Holdings. To me." His eyes gleamed with greed. "I’ll give you everything—money, resources, power. We’ll be unstoppable, just like before. I’ll compensate you tenfold."

Evelyn’s smile turned lethal. "Dom, your delusions are almost impressive." She leaned in, close enough to watch him flinch. "What about Vanessa? Or did you forget her already?"

She didn’t care. But his answer would be telling.

Dominic waved a dismissive hand. "I told you—we’re done. She’s a big girl; she’ll survive." His tone turned oily. "If you want, I’ll cut her off completely. Just say the word."

Bella’s nails dug into her palms.

Evelyn studied him—the man who’d stolen her work, betrayed her trust, and now discarded Vanessa like trash.

Pathetic.

She turned on her heel without another word.

Bella fell into step beside her, shaking her head. "How did you ever fall for that snake?"

Evelyn’s laugh was bitter. "Youthful stupidity."

Behind them, Dominic’s voice cracked like a whip. "Evelyn! You’ll regret this!"

She didn’t look back.
###Chapter 286

"You're overcomplicating things!" Evelyn sighed, realizing it was pointless to argue with someone like him. She brushed past Dominic, pausing only to pat his shoulder.

"You and Vanessa would make a perfect pair. Seriously, you two are meant for each other." Trash belongs with trash. They deserved each other—why waste time ruining other people's lives?

"You don't believe me?" Dominic spun his wheelchair to face her retreating figure, misinterpreting her words as lingering bitterness.

He didn’t catch the sarcasm lacing her tone, convinced she was still wounded by his betrayal.

Silence. Evelyn didn’t look back.

After a moment of contemplation, Dominic convinced himself there was still hope.

Evelyn’s anger meant she still cared. If he played his cards right, he could win her back. With her skills and her family’s influence, his future would be secure. Maybe then, his estranged mother would finally acknowledge him.

Vanessa stirred awake, blinking against the harsh hospital lights. The first thing she saw was Dominic sitting beside her bed, meticulously peeling an apple.

He used to do this for her all the time—slicing the fruit into delicate pieces, feeding them to her with tender care. The memory made her chest tighten.

"Nate..." Her voice was weak as she reached for him. "Our baby..."

She already knew. The moment she’d confronted Evelyn, she’d made her choice. The child was never part of the plan. A calculated risk—one she could now blame on Evelyn.

But where was Evelyn?

Her gaze darted around the room. "How did you find me? Where’s Evelyn? She—she did this to our—"

"Vanessa."

Dominic’s knife stilled. He dropped the peel into the trash with deliberate calm. "Enough."

Her eyes widened. "What are you talking about?"

"You’ve been acting for too long. I’m exhausted. You should be too." He resumed slicing, the rhythmic tap of the blade against the plate unnervingly steady.

"Evelyn called me to settle your bills. She’s the one who brought you here. If she’d wanted to hurt you, you wouldn’t have made it to the hospital at all." He set the knife down, holding up the apple core. "I used to give you the best parts and keep the scraps for myself. But I’m done."

His gaze locked onto hers, cold and final. "We’re over."
###Chapter 287

Dominic tossed the apple core into the trash bin with a flick of his wrist.

Vanessa studied his expression—cold, detached. Gone was the concern that once softened his features. He meant every word. This wasn't a bluff. He was ending things.

No point pretending anymore. She inhaled sharply. "Fine. I set her up. So what?"

Her fingers dug into the hospital sheets. "If she hadn't moved, I wouldn't have fallen. I wouldn't have lost the baby." Her voice cracked as she pressed a hand to her abdomen. "Even if it was my fault, that child didn't deserve this. It was yours."

Dominic shook his head. "I don't care whose it was. That child was innocent. But let's be honest—neither of us wanted it to begin with."

His gaze lifted to the ceiling, exhaling slowly. "Vanessa, you've crossed a line."

A chill slithered down her spine.

"I had your medical records pulled." His tone was clinical. "You scheduled an abortion weeks ago. If not for the infection delaying it, that pregnancy would've been terminated already, wouldn't it?"

Her breath hitched. How? She'd chosen a reputable hospital precisely to avoid this. Yet he'd uncovered everything.

"Since we were together, I'll be fair. Keep the penthouse. Take the severance. But you're done as Director at DR Holdings. Stay if you want—or don't. Chase your ambitions. I won't stand in your way."

Her pulse spiked. No. Without DR Holdings' backing, she'd lose her shot at the Perfumery Awards—her ticket to industry recognition.

"Nate—Dominic! You can't!" She ripped the IV from her arm, ignoring the sting. "I earned this product launch! Do you know what I sacrificed? At least let me stay through the awards!"

His eyes dropped to the blood beading on her hand. "I didn't say leave the company. But the Director role?" A humorless smile. "That was never yours to keep."

"Then what am I supposed to be?" Her laugh bordered on hysterical. "A laughingstock? How do I face the board? The judges? Anyone?"

"Be realistic." His voice turned weary. "You held that title because of us. What have you actually achieved? DR Holdings needs competence, not entitlement. I gave you every advantage. You squandered them. What else is there to say?"
###Chapter 288

Dominic felt no shred of sympathy for her now.

Looking back, he should have suspected she was plotting to get rid of the baby. He should have sent someone to investigate. But he hadn’t. He never imagined she would want to terminate the pregnancy so soon.

Dominic had even envisioned their future—building a life together. But she had been insincere, making her utterly worthless in his eyes.

"I’m being generous by not forcing you out of DR Holdings. Of course, the company will compete in the annual event, but it’ll be under DR Holdings’ name, not yours. You can only accept the award as a representative. That’s the best I can offer."

"No! You can’t do this!" Vanessa refused to accept it.

She had made a pact with herself—this competition was her chance to rise, to prove her worth.

Her emotions, her ambitions—everything was on the line. How could she just surrender her future?

"You have no right to take this from me! That new product is mine—my achievement! It belongs to me!" Vanessa lunged toward him, her desperation bordering on hysteria.

Dominic swiftly wheeled back, avoiding her. His gaze was icy as he studied her. The woman before him was unraveling. Once charming, once captivating—now she was nothing but madness.

Regret and disappointment twisted inside him.

"Take the credit?" He scoffed. "Vanessa, let’s not forget how you stole Evelyn’s recognition the first time. If you claim this product is yours, answer me—did you draft the formula? Was the inspiration yours? Did you even step foot in the lab? What did you contribute besides trading your body for results? What right do you have to call it yours?"

"From raw materials to trials, the company funded everything. Letting you accept the award as a representative is already leniency. If you push me further, don’t blame me for what comes next."

Vanessa hadn’t expected such ruthlessness. Her defiance crumbled, tears spilling down her cheeks.

"Dominic, why bother pretending to be righteous? Weren’t you part of the plan to ruin Evelyn? Now you regret it? Now you miss your ex and want to cut me off?"

"This has nothing to do with Evelyn."

Yes, he regretted it. He wanted her back. But even without Evelyn, there was no salvaging what he and Vanessa had.

The memory of her kneeling before Lucien, begging for his help—Dominic’s stomach turned. Disgust coiled in him so thickly he could barely stand the sight of her.

The more he denied it, the more Vanessa blamed Evelyn.

Her nails dug into the hospital sheets, drawing blood. "Do you really think Evelyn would take you back? Open your eyes—she’s already at the top with Celestia Group. Why would she waste a second thought on you? It’s pathetic!"

"Enough." His voice was steel.

Before, he might have believed her. But since leaving DR Holdings, Evelyn had thrived. And now, with the Hawthorne family’s backing, she didn’t need him.

"Don’t you know how to verify the truth? Go see for yourself. You think I’m vile? How many ‘pure’ people do you think exist in this industry? At least I’m honest! But Evelyn?" She laughed bitterly, mocking his naivety.
###Chapter 289

"I can see you're still recovering from surgery, so I won't argue with you anymore."

Dominic turned the wheelchair around, his voice clipped. "I need to go rest. I'll arrange for someone to take care of you. As for going home, we'll discuss it when you're discharged."

There was nothing more to say. Besides Evelyn, he had to consider the company’s interests. Vanessa couldn’t hold her position indefinitely.

The moment Evelyn got home, she rushed into the shower. Today had been a relentless assault of bad luck.

Vanessa wasn’t a real threat, but the entire ordeal had left her seething.

She hadn’t expected Vanessa to weaponize her pregnancy like that.

The woman was far more ruthless than Evelyn had ever imagined.

Stepping out of the shower, Evelyn noticed a missed call from "Grumpy Artisan." Her lips pursed. Something must be wrong.

She hit redial.

After a few rings, a low voice answered. "Hello?"

"Good employees don’t skip work," Evelyn teased. "Aren’t you afraid your boss will fire you?"

Given his earlier behavior, he should’ve been terrified of his employer. But the man on the line sounded anything but amused.

"I don’t want to do it anymore. Find someone else."

He tried to hang up, but Evelyn cut in sharply. "Wait! Why? You already agreed! Is it the pay? What’s the issue?"

"Nothing. I just don’t want to."

"That’s not how contracts work!"

Silence. Then, quietly, "I’m sorry."

The line went dead.

Evelyn called again. No answer.

She clenched her fists.

What is happening today? Everything’s falling apart.

Frustration coiled inside her. She needed an outlet.

Changing quickly, she stormed to Phoenix Labs.

Her private lab had been locked since the last project’s success. With Sophia away, no one had been inside.

Evelyn slammed the door shut behind her, locking it.

Outside, confused murmurs rose.

Victoria Sterling, alerted to Evelyn’s arrival, hurried over and knocked.

"Evelyn? It’s Victoria."

No response—only the faint clinking of glassware.

A new project? There’d been no announcements.

"Evelyn, are you working on something? Need help? Should I call Sophia?"

Still nothing.

Whispers spread. "Do you think something’s wrong?"

Victoria shot them a glare. "Nonsense. She’s developing a new product. Unless you’ve all finished your quarterly assignments?"

The staff scattered instantly.

Alone in the lab, Evelyn exhaled sharply.

Today’s chaos wasn’t over yet.
###Chapter 290

Victoria Sterling stood outside the door, her worry growing with each passing minute. She pulled out her phone and dialed Isabella Thornton. "Has Evelyn said anything to you about new product developments?"

"No. Why? What's going on?" Isabella had just returned from the hospital, grocery bags in hand, before diving into housework. The hum of the vacuum cleaner filled the background, making it hard to hear Victoria clearly.

"Evelyn locked herself in the lab and won't respond. I tried talking to her, but she's completely shut me out. I don’t think she’s okay. I’m really concerned."

Isabella froze, her grip tightening on the vacuum handle. She quickly switched it off, muttering under her breath, "Could it be because of what happened earlier? She seemed fine when she left."

Victoria’s curiosity piqued. "What happened earlier?"

"It’s complicated. She’s still in the lab, right? I’ll go check on her." Isabella hastily set aside her cleaning supplies, untied her apron, scrubbed her hands, and rushed out the door.

The lab remained eerily silent. Frustrated, Victoria could only sink into the sofa outside, waiting. As office hours ended, employees trickled out one by one. Nearly an hour had passed before Isabella arrived, breathless from hurrying.

"Is she still in there?"

Victoria gestured toward the lab with a pout. Isabella nodded and hurried over, knocking firmly. "Evelyn, it’s Bella. Open up. What are you doing in there? Let me help you. Evelyn—"

Before she could finish, the lab door swung open, releasing a wave of nauseating fumes. Isabella recoiled, coughing violently, her eyes watering. She couldn’t stop.

Victoria jerked her head up at the sound, but before she could react, the overpowering stench hit her too. She doubled over, hacking. "Wh-what is that?"

Both women struggled to breathe, yet Evelyn stood unaffected, blinking at them. "Were you looking for me?"

Silence.

They had been pounding on the door, calling her name—how could she not know?

Between coughs, neither could form a coherent response.

"Sorry. Forgot to turn on the ventilation," Evelyn said flatly. She reached over and flicked the exhaust fan on. The air cleared slightly as the fumes dissipated.

Once she caught her breath, Isabella wiped her teary eyes and scanned the room. "Evelyn, what were you doing in here? That smell was unbearable."

"Just an experiment. I wanted to see what happens when you combine the strongest scents." Evelyn stepped out, her expression shadowed. The day’s events had clearly left her in a dark mood.

What do you get when you mix all the worst things together?

In perfumery, bold risks sometimes led to breakthroughs. Evelyn had shut the world out, losing herself in the process.

"You could’ve suffocated in there!" Victoria rasped, still coughing. "That wasn’t bold—it was reckless."

"The results were interesting. I kept samples for further testing." Evelyn peeled off her gloves with clinical detachment.
###Chapter 291

"Y-You're serious?"

It wasn't that Evelyn doubted her own abilities.

But the weight of the moment was crushing. So crushing that its echoes would linger far longer than she anticipated.

Vanessa had always been like this, even in the beginning. It was impossible to predict how much worse she could get. Right now, her mood was undeniably foul.

Evelyn had no desire to argue, so she simply said, "Fine, since you're done, pack up and go. It's getting late."

"I'll take her home," Isabella offered.

They boarded the bus together.

The moment they stepped inside, the driver called out without hesitation, "Ladies, you sure went heavy on the perfume today, huh?"

Isabella laughed awkwardly, cheeks flushing.

As a perfumer, carrying traces of various scents was inevitable—and not all of them pleasant.

Perfume ingredients were complex, and the creation process even more so.

They were used to drawing odd looks in public, but the overpowering, peculiar aroma clinging to them today was something else entirely.

Even Isabella, who was accustomed to drowning in fragrance notes and had built up a tolerance to all kinds of smells, found it unbearable—let alone strangers.

Vanessa was lost in thought, silent.

The second she took her seat, she turned to stare out the window. No one could guess what was on her mind.

The driver, however, was a chatterbox.

Once he started talking, there was no stopping him.

He steered with one hand and rolled down the window with the other. "Hope you don't mind—just need some fresh air circulating."

Isabella shook her head, forcing a polite smile.

A little night breeze would be nice.

"So, what brand is that perfume? Strong stuff," the driver remarked as he navigated the streets.

"Just something generic," Isabella joked.

The driver looked enlightened.

"No wonder it's so intense. With perfumes, strong doesn't always mean better. Sometimes, the subtlest scents are the most addictive—the kind you barely notice."

"Once, a woman got on my bus, and I didn't smell a thing. But when she left? The whole bus carried her fragrance. No idea what she was wearing, but it had to be high-end."

"Why does it have to be high-end?" Vanessa suddenly cut in, her voice sharp.

Both Isabella and the driver flicked their gazes toward her, studying her from the corners of their eyes.

"Common sense," the driver said with a shrug. "Only luxury perfumes last that long. And that one? Had to be an international brand."

"I'm saving up. Once I've got enough, I'm buying my wife a bottle. Shame I never found out what it was." He sighed dramatically.

Vanessa didn't respond.

Only when she stepped off the bus, just before the doors closed, did she turn back and say coolly, "International brands aren't always the best."

The driver blinked, momentarily speechless.

But the doors were already shutting, and he simply shook his head, assuming she was just making excuses.
###Chapter 292

Evelyn let out a soft sigh, tilting her head slightly. "Why are you even entertaining his nonsense?"

"There's some validity to it," Sophia countered, her fingers tightening around her purse strap. "Local perfumers and brands are gaining traction, but the majority still swear by international labels. As if they're inherently superior." Her voice carried a hint of frustration.

Evelyn shrugged, her gaze drifting to the city lights beyond the window. "To a certain extent, he's not wrong. Right now, the overall craftsmanship here hasn't caught up to the legacy of those global giants."

"Maybe not yet," Sophia said firmly, lifting her chin. "But we will. Mark my words."

Evelyn could see the fire in her friend's eyes—a determination that had always defined Sophia. One day, Veridia would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the titans of the industry. The world would recognize their brilliance.

"Sophia, since you're home, I should head out," Evelyn said, turning toward the door.

Sophia grabbed her wrist, a playful smirk tugging at her lips. "Hold on! You're already here—why rush off? Last time, I was too drunk to be a proper host. Let me make it up to you tonight."

Evelyn hesitated, glancing at her watch. "It's getting late. I might not find a cab."

Sophia waved off the concern. "No worries. Worst-case scenario, I'll have Harrison drop you off."

At the mention of his name, a faint blush crept up Evelyn's neck. "I don't want to inconvenience anyone."

"Please," Sophia scoffed, looping her arm through Evelyn's. "Alexander will pay him triple overtime."

With that, she tugged Evelyn toward the gated entrance of Crestview Heights. This time, Evelyn had her access card, so they breezed past security without a hitch.

For Evelyn, stepping into this opulent neighborhood for the second time was surreal. The first had been in Alexander's sleek car, the memory still vivid. Now, walking through the manicured pathways, she couldn't help but marvel at the sheer luxury surrounding her.

The residences were nothing short of breathtaking—sprawling estates with grand architectural details, each home meticulously distanced for privacy. The air smelled of jasmine and freshly trimmed grass, the landscape illuminated by soft golden lights. Even at night, the beauty was undeniable.

Sophia's home, when they finally reached it, left Evelyn momentarily speechless.

"Make yourself comfortable," Sophia said, kicking off her heels by the door. "What's your poison?"

"Uh—anything's fine," Evelyn murmured, sinking into the plush sofa. The sheer scale of the place made her feel oddly out of place, despite having visited before.

Sophia returned with two glasses of chilled lemonade, handing one over. Evelyn took it gratefully, her eyes still scanning the lavish interior.

"So... it's just you and Alexander living here?" she asked, curiosity getting the better of her. "No staff?"

On TV, mansions like this were always teeming with maids, butlers, and gardeners.

Sophia chuckled. "Alexander values his privacy. So do I. We have a cleaning service and a gardener who comes by, but no live-in staff. It’s quieter this way."

Evelyn exhaled, leaning back. "That’s rich people logic for you. If it were me? I’d hire an army of maids—someone to clean, someone to cook, someone to give me massages, someone to gossip with..."

Sophia burst out laughing. "Are you sure you wouldn’t be creeped out by a hundred strangers lurking in your house?"

Evelyn grinned. "Worth it."
###Chapter 293

"Why should I be afraid? They're all employees I hired myself."

After a moment's consideration, Evelyn realized there was nothing to fear. In fact, it was a good thing.

Vanessa shook her head and settled cross-legged in front of her, sipping her juice.

"What exactly are you mixing, Vanessa? The scent is... complicated. Don't tell me you're experimenting with something new." She wrinkled her nose. "This one is... certainly memorable."

Ever since she'd stepped into the cab, Evelyn had been trying to identify the layers of the fragrance.

The blend was too intricate—too many notes clashing and melding, making it impossible to distinguish any single element.

"I haven't decided yet. It's just a test."

Vanessa tilted her head, lost in thought.

At first, she had simply been playing around with spices and essential oils on a whim, with no clear goal in mind.

But Evelyn’s and Victoria’s remarks had sparked an idea. Maybe there was potential in this chaotic concoction.

Every scent in the world was unique—perfumes, oils, even the rawest of natural aromas.

Nature had blessed them with an endless palette of fragrances.

And if combined just right, they could create something entirely new—light or heavy, crisp or intoxicating.

Who was to say this wouldn’t captivate someone?

"Actually... I think you should shower first."

Washing off the lingering scents seemed far more urgent.

The sound of a car pulling up interrupted their conversation.

Evelyn stood from the couch.

"Since Mr. Kensington is back, I should get going."

"Why so nervous? He doesn’t bite."

Vanessa waved for her to stay, setting down her juice before heading to the door to greet him.

"You're early today."

Dominic had barely spoken when he paused, his nose twitching.

"Achoo—ah—"

Behind him, Harrison sneezed violently, barely managing to stifle the third one behind his hand.

Vanessa’s eye twitched.

Was it that overpowering? Had she just grown immune to it?

"Did you..."

Dominic gave her a slow once-over. "Visit the lab again? New experiment?"

"Just playing around." She shrugged.

"And?" He nodded.

"It’s... unforgettable."

Evelyn, standing off to the side, nearly choked on her own breath.

Dominic Kensington truly lived up to his reputation—diplomatic to a fault.

The man could spin even this into a compliment.

His gaze shifted to Evelyn, and he offered a polite nod.

"Good to see you, Ms. Thornton."

The moment his attention landed on her, Evelyn stiffened, standing ramrod straight. Vanessa barely suppressed a laugh.

"We're not at the office. No need for formalities."

"Force of habit."

Even with Vanessa’s reassurances, facing Dominic still made Evelyn’s nerves spike.

He wasn’t cruel, but his presence alone commanded respect—an unspoken authority that made people straighten without realizing it.

Every time, Evelyn found herself in awe of Vanessa.

Not just anyone could stand beside a man like that without flinching.

"I should get going, Vanessa. It's getting late."

She grabbed her bag and made for the door.

"It is late. Why don’t you—"

"Harrison," Dominic cut in smoothly before Vanessa could finish.

Harrison immediately understood.

"Allow me to drive you home, Ms. Thornton."
###Chapter 294

"No, that won't be necessary. I've already inconvenienced you twice. I can easily hail a cab myself—it's still early."

Evelyn waved her hands dismissively, her cheeks flushing slightly at the thought of causing more trouble.

"If you insist, then at least let me walk you to get one," Harrison countered, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Evelyn fell silent, her fingers nervously twisting the strap of her purse. Beside them, Vanessa watched the exchange with amused eyes, her lips curling into a knowing smile.

She stepped forward and gave Evelyn's shoulder a reassuring pat. "Just let him accompany you, dear. It's no trouble at all."

"Achoo!"

Harrison sneezed violently, his nose wrinkling in discomfort.

Vanessa rolled her eyes. The moment they left, she was sprinting upstairs for a shower. At first, she hadn't noticed, but Harrison's relentless sneezing had made her painfully aware of the lingering scent clinging to her skin.

Even from a distance, his reaction had been immediate. She could only imagine how much worse it would be up close—especially for Alexander.

"I should go wash up," Vanessa muttered, already turning toward the stairs.

But before she could take a single step, Alexander's hand closed around her wrist, pulling her firmly against his chest.

"Don't—I reek," she protested, squirming in his hold.

Instead of releasing her, Alexander buried his face in the crook of her neck and inhaled deeply. "Who said that? You smell incredible. It's your scent—unique, intoxicating."

Vanessa couldn't help but laugh. The line was cheesy, but her traitorous heart still fluttered at his words, even if they were just meant to placate her.

"I'll take the compliment, but I still need a shower. Otherwise, I might start repelling small animals," she teased, reaching up to lightly tap his cheek before slipping free.

As the warm water cascaded over her, Vanessa's thoughts drifted back to the woodcarver's shop.

That brash young man—Julian—had a temper, but something about him struck her as oddly trustworthy.

The problem was, she knew nothing about him beyond a phone number scribbled on a receipt.

If she couldn't reach him soon, the new product development would stall indefinitely. The initial samples she'd taken weren't enough for proper testing.

Human nature was funny that way—the harder something was to obtain, the more desperately one wanted it.

With a sigh, she stepped out of the shower, toweled off, and slipped into her silk nightgown.

Alexander had already showered in the guest bathroom. Now, he lounged on the bed in his pajamas, flipping through a stack of documents.

The moment he heard her, he set the papers aside and watched her expectantly.

But Vanessa barely glanced his way.

She bee-lined for her wardrobe, rummaging through drawers with increasing frustration when she didn't find what she sought.

After a moment, she paused, her gaze drifting toward Alexander—though her distant expression made it clear her thoughts were miles away.

Alexander arched a brow. "Lose something?"

Before he could finish, Vanessa was already striding past him and out the door.

His jaw dropped.

She'd just... walked out. Without a word.

For the first time in his life, Alexander Kensington had been completely, utterly ignored.

He slumped against the headboard, momentarily stunned. So this was what it felt like.

And by none other than his own wife.

Just as he debated whether to follow her or wait, the sound of returning footsteps reached his ears.
###Chapter 295

Evelyn was clutching something tightly in her palm when she returned this time.

Dominic couldn't quite make out what it was from where he stood.

She placed the sample on the worktable, flicked on the desk lamp, and examined it under the warm glow. The fragrance was... extraordinary. At first whiff, it seemed artificially enhanced, yet further inspection proved it was completely natural, emanating purely from the wood grain itself. This discovery made her fingers tingle with excitement - she had to trace its origin.

But finding the source might prove impossible if that temperamental young craftsman had truly disappeared.

As for tracking him down...

Evelyn turned to ask Dominic's opinion, only to find him looming directly behind her. She gasped, nearly dropping the precious sample. "When did you get so close?"

"Where else would I be?" His voice carried a distinct edge of irritation. "Finally decided to acknowledge my existence?"

"I was just puzzling over something."

With a playful pout, she tugged at his sleeve. "I didn't mean to ignore you, really."

"That makes it worse," he grumbled, pinching the tip of her nose affectionately before his gaze dropped to the wooden fragment in her hand. "This is what's got you so distracted?"

"Mmm." She nodded eagerly.

Dominic plucked it from her fingers, bringing it to his nose for a careful sniff. His eyebrows knitted together. "Remarkable scent profile."

"Right? It's unlike any sandalwood or aromatic timber I've encountered. Completely unique in my experience," Evelyn explained, her eyes sparkling with professional curiosity.

Dominic shrugged. "The world's full of undiscovered wonders. Could be an unknown species or some advanced grafting technique."

"You think it's plant hybridization?" She shook her head. "We've worked with grafted specimens at Silverpine Valley for our new product line. This is different."

That very difference made it irresistible.

Seeing her furrowed brow, Dominic considered the problem. "Where'd you acquire this? That antique shop on Antiquarius Lane again?"

"Yes."

"Simple then. Ask the proprietor about his suppliers."

Dominic straightened, making the solution sound elementary.

"The shop owner doesn't know. I got this scrap from their part-time worker - that moody young craftsman. He's the only one who might know its origin. I asked him to save more for me, but..." Her shoulders slumped. "He vanished without notice."

"A young craftsman?"

Dominic's eyes narrowed slightly, focusing on an aspect Evelyn hadn't emphasized.

Unaware, she continued musing, "Yes. I suspect he wasn't just some apprentice. His sudden disappearance might relate to this wood sample."

She lifted the fragment, studying its grain patterns with renewed intensity. Though she lacked concrete evidence, her instincts screamed there was a connection.

"You seem... unusually interested in him."

Suddenly, Dominic caged her between his arms against the worktable, his towering frame radiating quiet menace.

"Only in his materials," she corrected quickly, though a mischievous glint entered her eyes. "Though that boy did have explosive temper - like a firecracker waiting to ignite. Quite memorable."

She recalled how the young man's eyes would darken at the slightest provocation.

"Hardly more than a child," Dominic muttered, though his possessive grip didn't loosen.
###Chapter 296

Evelyn's laughter filled the room, but it was cut short when Alexander suddenly grasped her chin. Her breath hitched as she blinked up at him in surprise.

"Is he really that amusing?" His voice was low, edged with something dark.

She swallowed hard. "N-No, not at all."

All she had been thinking about was sourcing quality wood for her project. Why was Alexander acting like this? She hadn’t even spared a second thought for that craftsman.

Sometimes, his possessiveness was overwhelming.

"So, he wasn’t interesting just now? Weren’t you praising him earlier?"

Alexander was being impossible. Evelyn had brushed it off as playful teasing, but the intensity in his gaze told her this was different. He looked genuinely wounded.

"I meant his woodwork was impressive! Just his woodwork!" She hurried to explain, tilting her head to study his expression. "Remember those carved figurines I brought home? You said they were adorable—like a pair of twins. Every time I see them, I think of us."

Her survival instincts kicked in. She leaned closer, her voice softening. "You’re the only one who fascinates me. There’s no one else."

A flicker of amusement crossed Alexander’s face, his stern expression easing into a faint smirk.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn pressed a quick kiss to his cheek. "You’re ridiculous. Why would you even be jealous of some carpenter I met once?"

Alexander exhaled, his shoulders relaxing slightly. "Who said I was jealous?"

"You weren’t?" She arched a brow, teasing. "You looked like you wanted to murder someone just now."

His eyes darkened. "Are you sure it was murder in my eyes? Or something else?" He pulled her abruptly from the chair, lifting her effortlessly.

Evelyn gasped, her arms instinctively wrapping around his neck. "That’s not what I meant!"

"Then what did you mean?"

He carried her to the bed, lowering her gently before caging her beneath him. His forehead rested against hers, their breaths mingling. This close, she could see the flecks of gold in his brown eyes.

"Alex..." She whispered his name, tightening her hold on him. "No one in this world compares to you."

The words were sincere, and they unraveled something in him. His gaze deepened, fingers tracing her cheek with aching tenderness.

"Will you always feel this way?"

The vulnerability in his voice caught her off guard. Despite his wealth, power, and status, he still needed reassurance. It made her heart ache.

"Always." She nodded firmly. "You’re the best, Alexander Kensington. The absolute best."

Then she tugged him down, sealing her promise with a kiss.

Alexander groaned against her lips, deepening it with a hunger that left no room for doubt.
###Chapter 297

The moment Vanessa stepped out of Mercy General Hospital, she received the devastating news—Dominic had revoked her position as director of DR Holdings.

Even while hospitalized, his orders were executed with ruthless efficiency. Her office had been cleared out before she could even return.

Everyone at DR Holdings knew Vanessa was the CEO's fiancée. Yet no one expected this humiliating blow.

Before she could officially become Mrs. Reeves, her title vanished overnight.

Though the staff avoided direct comments, their sidelong glances spoke volumes.

Vanessa burned with humiliation. How could Dominic be so heartless? Without another word, she gathered her belongings and stormed out.

At The Chateau Royale, Preston, Dominic's secretary, made the call. "Mr. Reeves, Ms. Blake came by the office but left immediately after realizing her position was terminated."

"Good. Let her go," Dominic replied coolly.

Despite their past, he couldn't allow sentiment to cloud judgment. Vanessa was unfit for the role.

Keeping her as director would only burden the company.

Besides, he knew her ambitions ran deeper.

If she could betray him for Lucien Dubois, a mere directorship would never satisfy her.

Vanessa craved fame—to be hailed as the world's greatest perfumer.

She'd discard Dominic the moment a better opportunity arose.

But ambition without talent was a dangerous delusion.

In perfumery, skill was non-negotiable.

Hanging up, Dominic dialed another number. "Do you have the results I requested?"

Meanwhile, Vanessa marched into Lucien's suite at The Chateau Royale.

He should've left Veridian City by now, but his injuries delayed his departure.

The moment Lucien saw her, he yanked her inside, slamming her against the doorframe as his mouth crashed onto hers.

Vanessa shoved him back hard. Not this time. She wouldn't play his games anymore.

Lucien staggered, eyes narrowing. "What the hell?"

"I just had surgery. I'm not recovered," she snapped.

"Bullshit."

Lucien cared only about his desires. Her condition meant nothing.

The man was an animal, driven by primal hunger.

Vanessa swiftly dodged his grasp, pulling pepper spray from her purse. "Touch me again, and I'll blind you! I came to talk, not fuck!"

For the first time, Lucien hesitated. This fiery defiance was new.

Amused, he lit a cigarette, exhaling slowly. "Fine. What do you want? Clearly not a romantic reunion."
###Chapter 298

Lucien smirked, but Vanessa paid no attention as she cut straight to the chase.

"I have a business proposition for you."

"A proposition? From you?"

Lucien chuckled dismissively, his disbelief evident.

"If memory serves, you're hardly in a financial position to discuss business with me. And what could you possibly offer? You couldn't even keep your last promise."

His patience was wearing thin.

The old Vanessa would have softened her tone, attempted to flatter him, maybe even begged.

But now, with nothing left to lose, she stood her ground.

"You didn't keep your word either," Vanessa countered sharply.

"You promised to get me into this year's perfume championship and secure the trophy. Yet the application form you provided had multiple errors!"

"I fixed that for you, didn't I? What more do you want?" Lucien snapped back.

"Fixed it? You ruined me! Now that Dominic knows about us, he's cast me out of DR Holdings! How am I supposed to enter the competition now? How can I build my perfumery career? This is entirely your fault!"

She glared at him with barely contained fury.

Lucien remained unfazed, his lips curling into an amused smile.

"Vanessa, darling, let's be honest - our arrangement was mutually beneficial. As for my promise, didn't I deliver the corrected form? With that, you're qualified for the championship. And I've heard DR Holdings' registration was already approved. The judging is all that remains. If Dominic won't credit you, take it up with him."

"Don't worry, I'll deal with Dominic. But after everything I've done for you, don't I deserve compensation?" Vanessa's voice turned calculating.

Lucien studied her through narrowed eyes. "What exactly are you after?"

"There's a major perfume exhibition in Laurentia next week. I want you to take me."

She'd learned this exclusive event would host executives from major corporations and renowned perfumers.

Evelyn would be attending as Phoenix Labs' representative.

While not as prestigious as the annual championship, this gathering carried significant weight in industry circles, with stringent participation requirements.

Vanessa burned with envy. Why did Evelyn get all the opportunities while she had nothing? She refused to accept this injustice!

Lucien burst into laughter, cigarette ash scattering across the table.

"Vanessa, are you drunk? Do you understand the caliber of attendees? With your current standing, you think you can waltz in?"

His mocking tone deepened. "Let's be realistic - barely any perfumers from this country qualify."

"I know that! But you're qualified, so bring me as your guest!"

Vanessa met his gaze unflinchingly.

Lucien had considerable industry clout. His exact international standing remained unclear, but she knew he'd received an invitation.

Stubbing out his cigarette, he considered her. "True, I'm invited. But why should I bring you? Give me one compelling reason."

"Evelyn's attending," Vanessa paused dramatically. "It's difficult to touch her here, but abroad? Different rules apply. I can help you get revenge - guarantee she won't escape unscathed."

Lucien studied her as he weighed the proposal. The idea held undeniable appeal.

After a long moment, he extended his hand. "Deal."
###Chapter 299

After Julian Mercer, the young man from the woodcarving shop, refused Evelyn Carter's order, he disappeared without a trace. His phone number was changed, and the shop owner refused to disclose his whereabouts. It was as if he had simply vanished into thin air.

Alexander Kensington promised to help track him down, but Evelyn didn’t hold her breath. She knew it wouldn’t be easy.

Right now, she had more pressing matters to attend to.

Before she could focus on finding Julian, she had a perfume convention to attend in Laurentia. This was her first major event representing Phoenix Labs, and she had no familiar faces by her side.

Victoria Sterling was swamped with work, and Isabella Thornton couldn’t accompany her either.

Instead, the company assigned her an assistant—Adrienne Laurent.

Adrienne was experienced and fluent in the local language, which made her the perfect choice.

The flight was uneventful, but the unfamiliarity between them created an unspoken distance.

Exhausted from the journey, Evelyn collapsed into bed the moment she reached her hotel room in Laurentia.

She had no idea that Vanessa Blake and Lucien Dubois would check into the same hotel just two hours later.

"Why didn’t you book a suite? These rooms are ridiculously small," Lucien grumbled, scanning the space with displeasure.

Vanessa smirked and pointed upward.

"Thought you wanted revenge? Evelyn’s room is right above us. This is your golden opportunity."

Lucien tilted his head back and burst into laughter.

"What, you want me to drill a hole in the ceiling so she’ll fall straight into my arms?"

Vanessa rolled her eyes.

Sometimes, she questioned his intelligence.

"Of course not. But if something happens, you could always claim she wandered into the wrong room."

Understanding dawned on Lucien’s face, and he pinched Vanessa’s chin with a grin.

"You’re brilliant."

"Is that why you insisted on separate rooms?"

He had been without female company for a while and had suggested sharing a room to save costs. But Vanessa had refused, insisting on two rooms—far apart.

It had annoyed him.

"If I’m there, how are you supposed to have your fun?"

Vanessa chuckled, patting his shoulder. She was confident her plan would succeed.

But her reasons for separate rooms went deeper.

First, she had no intention of sharing a space with the lecherous Lucien. That would be torture.

Her body was her greatest asset, and she wasn’t about to waste it on him.

Second—and most importantly—she wanted Evelyn utterly ruined by the time they left Laurentia.

A sharp knock jolted Evelyn awake.

She dragged herself out of bed, raking a hand through her tangled hair as she shuffled to the door.

"Who is it?"

"Ms. Carter, we need to go over today’s schedule," Adrienne’s crisp voice replied.

"I thought the event didn’t start until tomorrow afternoon?"

Evelyn was still groggy, irritation creeping into her tone.

Adrienne was efficient, but her rigid professionalism grated on Evelyn’s nerves.

"True, but the Laurentia organizers moved the exhibition to tomorrow morning. All participants are invited."

She glanced at her clipboard.

"Additionally, there’s a welcome dinner tonight. You’ll need to shower, change, and get ready immediately."
###Chapter 300

"Must I really go?" Evelyn groaned, burying her face deeper into the pillow.

Sleep deprivation was cruel, and all she craved was another hour—no, five—of blissful unconsciousness.

"Technically, no," Adrienne replied smoothly.

Evelyn perked up for half a second before Adrienne crushed her hope.

"But socially? Absolutely."

"Social norms can burn," Evelyn muttered, rolling onto her back and stretching like a starfish across the mattress. Heaven. Pure heaven.

Adrienne marched in, undeterred.

"Ms. Carter, biologically speaking, napping now would ruin your circadian rhythm. You won’t sleep tonight, which means tomorrow’s preliminary round will be a disaster."

She adjusted her glasses, the lenses flashing ominously.

"Studies show morning fatigue leads to poor performance all day. And if you embarrass DR Holdings in front of Celestia Group’s executives—"

Evelyn groaned louder.

Adrienne’s voice was a relentless drill. Evelyn had never considered death by nagging before, but here she was, contemplating it.

Still, the woman wasn’t wrong.

Grudgingly, Evelyn pushed herself up, legs crossed, hair a wild halo. "Fine. Shower. Clothes. Human interaction. Got it."

Adrienne nodded, satisfied. "Excellent decision, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn scowled. As if I had a choice.

"Meet me back here in an hour," Adrienne said, already halfway out the door.

This trip to Laurentia was off to a fantastic start.

The hot water helped. Slightly.

Wrapped in a towel, Evelyn eyed the four dresses Isabella had packed. Formal enough for corporate events, but not stiff. She’d vetoed half of them last-minute—who needed eight outfits for three days?

She settled on a navy maxi dress, draping a cream shawl over her shoulders. Good enough.

Adrienne answered her knock in a crisp pantsuit, her gaze sweeping over Evelyn’s ensemble. A barely-there nod. Approval.

"Where’s this dinner at?" Evelyn asked, forcing cheer.

"The organizers are sending a car. We should head down now—it’ll arrive any minute."

"Punctual as always, Adrienne."

Adrienne didn’t smile. "This is my job, Ms. Carter. Do yours well, and we’ll both leave Laurentia with our reputations intact."

Evelyn blinked.

Who hurt you?

But she kept that thought to herself as they stepped into the elevator.

Somehow, she already missed her bed.
###Chapter 301

When Evelyn stepped into the reception banquet venue, her breath caught in her throat. This wasn't what she'd expected at all. The lavish setup resembled a high-end wedding more than a professional gathering.

The open-air garden venue sparkled under delicate fairy lights. Waitstaff in crisp uniforms circulated with silver trays while a string quartet played softly in the background. Everywhere she looked, clusters of elegantly dressed guests mingled.

Her stomach tightened at the sea of unfamiliar faces speaking multiple languages. Forcing a polite smile at passing strangers, she turned to Adrienne. "Are all these people really contestants?"

Adrienne adjusted her glasses while scanning the event brochure. "According to this, yes."

Evelyn's temples throbbed. "But I thought this was an exclusive competition? There must be hundreds here!" The sheer number made her palms sweat beneath her clutch.

"Who exactly are we supposed to meet from the organizing committee?" Evelyn already contemplated making a quick exit. Room service at The Chateau Royale sounded infinitely better than navigating this overcrowded maze in heels.

"The chairperson is Serena Whitaker, but I don't see her yet." Adrienne squinted across the crowded terrace.

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "You don't see her... or you wouldn't recognize her if you did?"

Adrienne's usually composed face flushed pink. "I've studied photographs of the committee members thoroughly. I'll know her when I see her."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. 'Of course you will,' she thought wryly.

"If you spot her, come get me. I need some air." Evelyn edged toward the perimeter.

Adrienne caught her wrist. "That would be terribly impolite. You should network with other competitors—"

"What exactly would chatting with them accomplish?" Evelyn interrupted, then immediately regretted it. Explaining basic professional etiquette to Adrienne was like talking to a brick wall.

She pressed a hand to her stomach. "I really need the ladies' room."

"Shall I accompany you?" Adrienne offered instantly.

"No! What if the chairperson arrives while we're both gone?" Evelyn forced a smile. "Keep watch here. I'll be quick."

Without waiting for a response, she slipped through the crowd toward a quieter corner. The moment she reached relative solitude, her shoulders dropped two inches. Why had she agreed to this? The moment she'd heard "networking event," she should have declined.

She'd imagined gaining technical insights, not making small talk with strangers. Social obligations were precisely why she'd left DR Holdings operations to Dominic and Vanessa. Their names popping into her head made her shake it sharply.

'Why am I even thinking about them?' As she lifted her gaze, a familiar silhouette moving through the crowd made her breath hitch.
###Chapter 302

"What the hell? Speak of the devil!"

Evelyn hadn’t even spoken Vanessa’s name aloud. She had merely thought of her.

Now, watching Vanessa stride toward her with that infuriating smirk, Evelyn rubbed her eyes and glanced away.

This can’t be real.

She was in Valmont, at the prestigious review banquet for the international perfumery competition. Vanessa couldn’t just waltz in here uninvited.

It must be a lookalike.

Evelyn turned back, scrutinizing the woman before her.

Same sharp features. Same piercing eyes. That same condescending lilt in her voice.

Damn it.

It was Vanessa.

"Well, well," Vanessa purred, tilting her head. "Surprised to see me?"

She was delighted by the shock and irritation flashing across Evelyn’s face.

Did Evelyn really think she was the only one worthy of being here?

Vanessa smirked. Where there’s a will, there’s a way.

Evelyn scoffed, crossing her arms. "No self-awareness, as usual."

Vanessa’s grin widened.

The more Evelyn bristled, the more satisfaction she felt.

"Did you honestly believe you were the only Veridian perfumer invited?" Vanessa taunted. "Unlike you, I’ve won multiple awards these past few years. I’m more accomplished. More recognized. So if you can be here, why not me?"

She preened, as if her mere presence at the banquet made her superior.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. She wasn’t about to waste breath arguing. The air was already thick enough without Vanessa’s toxicity fouling it further.

"Shameless," she muttered, turning to leave.

Vanessa grabbed her wrist.

"Excuse me?" she hissed. "Who are you calling shameless? You think Phoenix Labs is your golden ticket back into the industry? Please. It’s a nobody company in Veridia. And Veridia?" She smirked. "Irrelevant on the global stage."

The words stung—not because they were Vanessa’s, but because Evelyn had heard them before.

From Lucien Dubois.

And as much as she hated to admit it… he wasn’t wrong.

The world’s elite perfumers came from other nations. Veridia had talent, yes—but most had long since left, seeking recognition elsewhere.

Evelyn’s gaze swept the room.

The banquet was packed. Invitation-only, yet crowded.

And the organizers? Nowhere in sight.

Cannon fodder.

That’s all they were to the competition’s hosts. Either this was all for show… or the real players hadn’t even bothered to show up yet.

Her jaw tightened.

She refused to believe Veridia had no true masters.

They’re just hidden. Like the Hawthorne family.

Evelyn yanked her wrist free.

"Is that so?" she shot back. "If those of us who earned our invitations are nobodies, what does that make you? A parasite, feeding off others’ success?"

Vanessa’s smirk faltered—just for a second.

Then she laughed.

"Keep telling yourself that, Evelyn. But we both know—"

A hush fell over the crowd.

The doors at the far end of the hall swung open.

The organizers had arrived.

And behind them—

Evelyn’s breath caught.

Him.

Alexander Kensington.

The man who had single-handedly redefined modern perfumery.

And he was walking straight toward them.
###Chapter 303

"What did you just say?"

Vanessa Blake's expression darkened. She was about to retort when a familiar voice interrupted.

"Ms. Carter. What a pleasant surprise."

Evelyn Carter arched a brow.

Lucien Dubois?

So they planned this. Did they really follow me all the way here?

Not that it mattered. Evelyn wasn’t one to back down from a challenge.

She offered him a cold smile. "Still haven’t learned your lesson, Mr. Dubois? Looking for a rematch?"

Lucien stiffened at the taunt, the memory of his humiliating defeat flashing in his mind.

"This is a public venue, Ms. Carter. Surely you wouldn’t be so reckless."

He smirked, confident she wouldn’t dare make a scene.

Evelyn cracked her knuckles, the sound sharp in the air.

Vanessa paled.

She’d never witnessed Evelyn’s skills firsthand, but Lucien’s warnings and Dominic Reeves’ fear were enough.

Vanessa forced a laugh. "No need for hostility. We’re all just joking around."

She stepped closer, feigning sincerity. "Evelyn, Lucien came to apologize. We’re all foreigners here. Shouldn’t we stick together?"

Evelyn almost admired the audacity.

One second, Vanessa was sneering. The next, she was preaching unity.

"Stick together with you?" Evelyn scoffed. "I’d rather swim with sharks."

She turned on her heel and walked away without another glance.

"That insufferable witch!"

Vanessa’s fists clenched, her nails digging into her palms as she glared at Evelyn’s retreating figure.

"Relax," Lucien murmured, his gaze calculating. "Her arrogance won’t last."

He gestured around them. "This is Valmont—the heart of perfumery. She’s nothing here."

His voice dripped with disdain.

Vanessa smirked.

Good.

She’d play along—for now.

Evelyn hadn’t gone far when Adrienne Laurent nearly collided with her.

"Evelyn! I checked the restroom—you weren’t there."

"Must’ve missed each other," Evelyn lied.

She had no intention of staying.

"I’m not feeling well. Probably food poisoning. Let’s head back."

Adrienne frowned. "But the organizer just arrived. We should at least greet them before leaving. It’s basic courtesy."

Evelyn hesitated.

Fine.

One quick exchange, then she’d be gone.

But as they turned toward the main hall, a familiar silhouette caught her eye.

Dominic Reeves.

And he wasn’t alone.

Her pulse spiked.

This night just got a lot more complicated.
###Chapter 304

The crystal chandeliers cast a warm glow over the grand ballroom, but the atmosphere felt anything but welcoming.

"Evelyn, you must understand—respect is a two-way street." Vanessa's voice was low but firm. "There's no point in pretending courtesy when the hosts clearly don't value us as guests."

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably in her heels. If not for her role as Phoenix Labs' representative, she would have walked out the moment they arrived.

"Still..."

Adrienne hesitated, but before she could finish, a smooth, aged voice cut in.

"Excuse me, ladies. Did I just overhear something about the hosts lacking respect for their guests?"

Both women turned to see an older gentleman approaching. His silver hair was impeccably styled, his skin surprisingly youthful for his age. He carried himself with an air of effortless sophistication, his sharp gaze fixed on them.

Adrienne recognized him instantly—Harrison Whitaker. Her breath hitched.

"M-My apologies, Mr. Whitaker! That wasn't what we—"

"Are you suggesting my hearing is failing me?" Harrison touched his ear with a wry smile. "I assure you, it's still quite sharp."

Adrienne opened her mouth again, but Evelyn placed a hand on her arm, silencing her.

"Your hearing is perfect, Mr. Whitaker," Evelyn said calmly. "And yes, that's exactly what I meant. The hosts have shown clear favoritism tonight. Some guests are treated as VIPs, while the rest of us are an afterthought."

Adrienne's eyes widened in horror. Did Evelyn have any idea who she was speaking to?

Harrison's expression darkened slightly, though his tone remained deceptively pleasant. "Is that so? Do enlighten me. What gave you that impression?"

"Evelyn," Adrienne whispered urgently, tugging at her sleeve.

But Evelyn ignored her. She met Harrison's gaze squarely.

"The organizers invited all of us here for this 'welcome dinner,' yet not a single member of the committee has bothered to greet us. We've been here nearly an hour, completely ignored."

She gestured around the room. "Meanwhile, I heard the lead organizer personally escorted another guest inside—someone deemed more important than the rest of us. If that's not favoritism, what is?"

Murmurs rippled through the nearby crowd as more guests turned to listen.

Evelyn's words struck a chord. Many had noticed the slight but hadn't dared to voice it.

At the edge of the gathering, Lucien Dubois smirked. "She just signed her own social death warrant."

Vanessa frowned. "What do you mean?"

Lucien's smile was cold. "Watch and learn."
###Chapter 305

The commotion around them was deafening, yet Lucien Dubois remained utterly composed. A glass of wine dangled carelessly from his fingers as he smirked at the unfolding drama.

"Do you recognize that man?"

Vanessa Blake glanced at the imposing figure before turning back to Lucien, shaking her head.

This was her first time in Laurentia—she wouldn’t know anyone here.

"That’s Harrison Whitaker," Lucien explained, forming the number eight with his fingers for emphasis. "A master perfumer from Valmont. This year, he’s chairing the competition. One of the world’s top eight perfumers—a genius that appears only once in centuries."

His voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Do you really think that woman can walk away unscathed after offending him? Or worse—make a name for herself in Laurentia’s perfumery world now?"

Vanessa’s lips curled into a delighted smile as understanding dawned.

"So she’s doomed?"

"Not necessarily."

Lucien shook his head, amusement dancing in his eyes.

"Mr. Whitaker is unpredictable. No one can ever guess his moods. Either way, this will be entertaining."

His words did nothing to dampen Vanessa’s glee.

No one enjoys being publicly humiliated, least of all a man of his stature.

Evelyn Carter had just called out the organizers for their incompetence, accusing them of bias.

She basically declared the entire event rigged, shaming them in front of everyone. She’s finished.

Faced with Evelyn’s sharp critique, Harrison merely arched a brow.

"I never claimed this would be fair."

The crowd fell silent.

Exclusive content from N?velDrama.Org.

Even Evelyn was momentarily stunned.

Unfazed, Harrison continued, his voice cutting through the tension. "The world isn’t fair. Every perfumer here knows that. Some are born with an extraordinary sense of smell. Some have families wealthy enough to fund their dreams. Others? No matter how hard they work, they’ll never match those born with talent. Is any of that fair? No. So why demand fairness from me?"

His brutal honesty left the audience reeling—yet no one could deny the truth in his words.

Life was unfair. Many had faced injustice from the moment they were born.

"I’m not asking for perfect fairness," Evelyn countered, her voice steady despite the weight of his gaze. "But basic respect is non-negotiable. Correct me if I’m wrong—most of us here haven’t even seen the organizing committee until now, have we?"

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the crowd, though no one dared to voice their support aloud.

Harrison said nothing, his piercing stare locked onto Evelyn.

The silence stretched, thick with tension, as if the room itself was holding its breath.

A bomb could have gone off, and no one would have noticed.

Harrison’s displeasure was palpable.

How dare this young woman—this nobody—publicly challenge him, a legend in the industry?

Beside Evelyn, Adrienne Laurent was already sweating.

How did things spiral so out of control?

She had taken every precaution, yet here they were—on the verge of disaster.

If she had known this would happen, she might have convinced Evelyn to skip the event entirely.

Meanwhile, Vanessa was practically glowing with satisfaction.

She’s finished. Her arrogance blinded her. Does she really think past success gives her the right to lecture Harrison Whitaker? He could ruin her with a single word.

A new thought struck her.

If I could get close to him—use his influence, maybe even learn from him—my career would skyrocket.

Just as the tension reached its peak, a sweet, melodic voice sliced through the silence.

"Daddy! I’ve been looking everywhere for you!"
###Chapter 306

A young woman in an elegant princess gown, her ash brown hair cascading down her shoulders, gracefully navigated through the crowd.

She clung to Harrison Whitaker's arm, her youthful face glowing with a radiant smile. That smile alone dissolved the tension hanging in the air.

The moment Harrison looked at her, his stern expression softened into one of pure adoration.

"You've been running around again, haven't you?" he chided gently.

"I wasn't!" she protested, then paused, suddenly aware of the odd atmosphere.

Glancing around, she blinked in confusion. "Why is everyone staring at me?"

Her gaze swept the room, and she realized the crowd wasn't just focused on her and her father—but also on...

"Evelyn!"

Her eyes sparkled with excitement as she called out the familiar nickname. Instantly, she released Harrison's arm and rushed forward to grab Evelyn Carter's instead.

"It's really you! I'm not imagining things! Evelyn, you're here! Did you come to see me?"

The entire room, including Evelyn, fell into stunned silence.

At that moment, the happiest person present was this bubbly, carefree young woman.

"I knew we'd always be friends! Why did you disappear on me? The sachet you made for me lost its scent after a while. I searched everywhere, but nothing compared to yours. Now that you're here, you have to tell me—"

"Ahem."

Harrison cleared his throat sharply, cutting her off. "Serena, mind your manners."

He couldn't reprimand her too harshly in front of everyone, so he settled for a warning.

"Daddy! I'm being perfectly polite!" Serena protested, tugging Evelyn forward. "Don't you remember? This is Evelyn, my best friend from Veridia! The one I told you about!"

She positioned Evelyn directly in front of Harrison, beaming.

"Evelyn, meet my dad!"

Both Evelyn and Harrison were left speechless.

This is beyond awkward, Evelyn thought.

Swallowing her discomfort, she extended her hand. "Hello. I'm Evelyn Carter, Serena's friend."

Harrison studied her outstretched hand, then glanced at his daughter's eager expression. With a measured nod, he accepted the handshake.

"Nice to meet you."

And just like that, the explosive tension from earlier dissipated.

The hostility in the air vanished completely.

Whispers of envy rippled through the crowd.

No one had expected Evelyn to be acquainted with Harrison Whitaker's daughter.

To them, this was a golden opportunity—an instant shortcut to success in the perfumery world.

With Serena's favor, they assumed Evelyn would effortlessly rise to the top.
###Chapter 307

Vanessa was seething with frustration at how things had unfolded.

She had been eagerly anticipating Evelyn's downfall, only for Serena to swoop in and ruin everything.

"How infuriating!" Vanessa clenched her jaw, watching Serena's radiant smile with barely concealed resentment.

To Vanessa, Serena was the wrench thrown into her carefully laid plans, the obstacle preventing her moment of triumph.

"Wait... Why does she seem familiar?" Vanessa's eyes narrowed as she studied Serena's features. "She mentioned meeting Evelyn in Veridia, but I've known Evelyn since university. I met most of her friends back then, and there weren't many. So why does Serena's name ring a bell?"

A sudden flash of recognition crossed Vanessa's face.

Across the hall, Serena was still chatting animatedly with Evelyn after the crowd had dispersed.

"Evie, I sent you my new number when I returned to Laurentia. Why didn't you call? I thought you'd forgotten about me." Serena pouted playfully.

"I never received it," Evelyn replied, genuinely surprised.

The memory of her old friend came flooding back. Serena had been an exchange student at their university, though nobody knew her true identity as the daughter of world-renowned perfumer Harrison Whitaker.

Back then, Serena had been more reserved, much like Evelyn herself. Their friendship had blossomed quietly among the scent-obsessed students who spent their days crafting perfumes and essential oils.

Evelyn remembered making Serena a unique sachet before her departure - an intricate blend of dried flowers tailored to Serena's preferences. She never imagined Serena would treasure it so dearly.

"Really? I sent it three times!" Serena's face fell momentarily before brightening again. "But look at us now! Fate clearly wanted us to reunite, didn't it?"

Evelyn chuckled. "Fate indeed."

It was wonderful to reconnect with an old friend in such unexpected circumstances.

"So," Serena asked between bites of cake, "are you here for the competition too?"

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "Weren't you just saying I came to visit you?"

Serena laughed, waving her fork. "That was just to diffuse the tension. Otherwise, you and my father might have come to blows, right?"

Evelyn was momentarily speechless.

'She's sharper than she lets on,' Evelyn realized. Despite the years apart, their easy rapport remained intact.

"What if we did fight?" Evelyn teased. "Whose side would you take?"

Serena swallowed another bite before answering matter-of-factly, "That's impossible. Dad's surrounded by bodyguards. You'd be pinned to the floor before you could lay a finger on him."

Evelyn could only shake her head at her friend's blunt assessment.
###Chapter 308

"Thank you, regardless. You still saved me back there!"

Evelyn found Serena's recount of the earlier situation hilarious.

No matter what, Serena had been kind enough to help her.

Serena flashed a sweet smile.

"Don't mention it! All I ask is that you teach me how to make a scented sachet. I adored yours so much that I tried making one myself, but every attempt ended in disaster."

"Your father is a master perfumer. Aren’t there any of his fragrances you like?" Evelyn asked after a brief pause.

"There are, but perfumes aren’t the same as the sachet you gave me. I can carry it everywhere, and the scent lingers for ages. I even tuck it under my pillow at night—it helps me sleep. Did you lace it with something? I swear, I’m addicted!"

Evelyn laughed. "If there were drugs in it, your father would’ve sniffed them out instantly."

Her gaze swept the room—Harrison had already vanished.

"Stop looking around. My father was just here for appearances. He has an important meeting," Serena said, reading Evelyn’s thoughts.

"Right. The rest of us are just background decor," Evelyn agreed.

She couldn’t deny the truth in Harrison’s words.

Life was unfair, and unequal treatment was inevitable.

What had irked her was the organizer’s blatant disregard for the other guests.

If they only cared about their VIPs, why bother inviting everyone else as seat fillers?

Serena chuckled.

"I overheard everything earlier. Honestly? I admired what you did."

"How so?"

"It’s the first time I’ve seen anyone stand up to my father like that. The look on his face? Priceless!"

She burst into laughter, utterly unbothered.

Evelyn, however, found her reaction amusing.

"If you put it that way, it almost sounds like a compliment. Should I be honored to be the first person who ever pissed him off?"

"Consider this your moment of glory."

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

After a beat, she asked, "You’re not upset?"

Serena stared at her as if she’d grown a second head.

"Why would I be? You weren’t wrong. My father is a snob. His ego’s the size of Veridia, and he only bothers with people he deems worthy. He’s used to endless flattery."

"Given his status and talent, he does deserve the praise."

Evelyn knew a little about Harrison’s work.

Some of his classic creations were favorites of hers, though she’d never had the chance to meet him before.

"Enough about him. Tell me about your life these past few years! Are you a perfumer at Phoenix Labs now?" Serena asked eagerly.

Evelyn sighed.

Her life wasn’t something she could sum up easily.

Serena blinked at her reaction.

Before she could press further, a voice interrupted them.

"Serena! It’s been ages!"

Serena turned to see a vaguely familiar face.

The woman beamed.

"You’ve gotten even more stunning! I almost didn’t recognize you!"
###Chapter 309

"Excuse me, who are you?"

Serena Whitaker blinked at the unfamiliar woman before her.

Vanessa Blake acted as if they were old friends, flashing a bright smile as she casually patted Serena's shoulder. "Hey, don’t you remember me? It’s me—Vanessa! Vanessa Blake!"

Serena fell silent, her brows furrowing slightly as she tried to recall.

Evelyn Carter nearly rolled her eyes.

Vanessa was such a suck-up. When had she ever been close to Serena back in university? Truth be told, most of her friends had been guys. The only time she bothered with girls was when she could get something out of them. Otherwise, she wouldn’t waste a second on small talk.

Back then, Evelyn had been too naive to see through Vanessa’s act.

Vanessa had deliberately befriended her, showering her with false kindness—all part of a calculated scheme.

Now that Vanessa knew Serena was Harrison Whitaker’s daughter, of course, she’d jump at the chance to cozy up to her.

When Serena still didn’t respond, Vanessa’s smile faltered, but she wasn’t about to give up. Quickly, she turned to Evelyn. "You remember, don’t you? We shared a dorm with Lily—er, Evelyn—back then. We used to eat at that little restaurant near the campus gates all the time. The one with the amazing pickled fish?"

At the mention of food, Serena’s eyes lit up. She nodded eagerly. "Oh! That place! Their pickled fish was incredible. I haven’t had anything like it since I left. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Is it still there?"

Seizing the opportunity, Vanessa slid into the seat beside her. "It is! The original owner retired and handed it over to his son, but the recipe’s exactly the same. I’ll take you there sometime!"

"Really?" Serena clapped her hands together. "I could fly back just for that!"

Vanessa laughed. "Then let’s go! You’ve been away from Veridian City for so long—there’s so much that’s changed. I’ll show you around. And trust me, there’s way more than just pickled fish. We’ll make a whole food tour out of it."

As she spoke, she shot Evelyn a smug glance.

Serena was just a sweet, naive girl. Getting close to her was child’s play for Vanessa—all she had to do was find common ground.

Maybe Serena could be another stepping stone for me.

Serena nodded enthusiastically before suddenly turning to Evelyn. "Evelyn, you have to take me out for some good food too!"

Vanessa’s smile stiffened.

Evelyn met her gaze, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "Of course."

"Evelyn, the perfumery competition is tomorrow. You’re not leaving right after, are you? Stay a few more days. I’ll show you all the best spots. Oh! And you have to come visit my house—you’ve never been!" Serena gushed.

Evelyn chuckled. "Don’t worry, I’m not going anywhere yet. I’ll be here a while longer. We’ll have plenty of time."

"Perfect! Now that we’ve reconnected, I can message you whenever I want. I’ve missed you so much!" Serena pulled out her phone. "Here, add me on WhatsApp!"
###Chapter 310

Vanessa stood nearby, pulling out her phone with a practiced smile. "We should exchange contacts for easier communication."

But before she could scan the code, Serena had already slipped her phone back into her pocket.

"I should go. Daddy will be looking for me. Let's catch up later!"

"Serena, wait—I haven't—"

Vanessa shot to her feet, but Serena didn’t spare her a glance. With a cheerful wave at Evelyn, she dashed off in the opposite direction.

Watching Serena disappear into the crowd, Vanessa clenched her phone so tightly her knuckles turned white.

"You always know how to step on others, Vanessa. But not everyone is willing to be your stepping stone. Be careful—you might trip one day."

Evelyn’s voice dripped with disdain.

"Why shouldn’t I? It’s what I do best," Vanessa snapped, her frustration boiling over. "Don’t act so righteous, Evelyn. You climbed your way up too, didn’t you? We’re not so different."

Humiliated by Serena’s dismissal, Vanessa lashed out at Evelyn instead.

If she couldn’t get close to Serena, then she’d go straight to the source. No need for detours.

"Only someone with a twisted mind assumes everyone else is just as rotten."

Evelyn gave her a cold once-over. "Have you ever taken a good look at yourself?"

"You—"

Before Vanessa could retaliate, Evelyn had already walked away, her assistant trailing behind.

Lucien, who had been watching the exchange with amusement, sauntered over. "I thought you had a knack for latching onto the right people."

Vanessa glared at Evelyn’s retreating figure. "Rome wasn’t built in a day."

"True," Lucien drawled. "But only if you actually finish building it. At your pace, you’ll never get anywhere."

His mocking tone cut deep. He knew exactly what Vanessa was after.

She was always looking for the next rung to climb. She’d given herself to him freely, trading favors for a shot at the annual competition.

Now that she’d set her sights on Harrison Whitaker, Lucien saw the writing on the wall.

Not that he cared. He’d grown bored of her anyway. Her greed amused him—they were cut from the same cloth.

Maybe he could still profit from her ambition.

Vanessa turned on him with a sneer. "Don’t act so high and mighty, Mr. Dubois. We’ve been here long enough, and I haven’t seen anyone bowing at your feet. Maybe you’re not as important as you claimed."

Back in Veridia, Vanessa had assumed Lucien was a big name in the industry. She’d thought clinging to him would elevate her status.

But here in Valmont?

He was just another face in the crowd. No special treatment, no VIP greetings.

Had he lied about his influence?

Or was he simply irrelevant?
###Chapter 311

The car ride back was filled with Adrienne's endless complaints. "Evelyn, we may have avoided disaster today, but your actions were completely reckless. Your impulsiveness nearly ruined everything we've worked for."

Evelyn had anticipated Adrienne's lecture, but not its relentless persistence. She offered a faint smile. "Was it really that bad?"

Adrienne's expression darkened. "Evelyn, I don’t understand how you can be so casual about this. Do you think it was nothing? You just happened to know Mr. Whitaker’s daughter. What if you hadn’t? What if she hadn’t shown up? What if she didn’t consider you a friend?"

Her voice grew sharper. "When we're in someone else’s territory, we play by their rules. Yes, the organizers were at fault, but there were better ways to handle it than publicly humiliating them. If they had disqualified us over this—"

"But they didn’t," Evelyn cut in, exasperated. "Honestly, your endless 'what ifs' are exhausting."

Adrienne fell silent, momentarily stunned.

Evelyn sighed. "Adrienne, I know you’re looking out for Phoenix Labs, and I appreciate that. But can’t you see? Competitors from Veridia and other smaller countries don’t matter here. Whether we qualify or not is irrelevant. Even if I won, they’d claim it was because of my connection to Serena."

Discrimination was already rampant, and now that everyone knew she was friends with Harrison Whitaker’s daughter, any victory would be tainted by accusations of favoritism.

Vanessa’s earlier remarks were proof enough.

Not everyone thought like Vanessa, but enough would. Evelyn had seen this coming long before she entered the competition.

Adrienne hesitated. She hadn’t considered that.

When Evelyn had confronted Harrison Whitaker, Adrienne had only feared the repercussions—that Phoenix Labs might never break into the international market.

Now, Evelyn’s words made sense.

"So... we’re trapped?" Adrienne asked cautiously.

If Evelyn competed, there were two outcomes: lose and return in disgrace, or win and be labeled a fraud.

If she withdrew, people would assume she was intimidated.

Either way, she couldn’t win.

"Exactly," Evelyn confirmed, though she wasn’t overly concerned.

Still, it was better to distract Adrienne with this dilemma than endure her endless scolding.

The tactic worked. Adrienne fell into deep thought, her earlier frustration replaced by strategic contemplation.

Back at the hotel, Adrienne retreated to her room, likely to draft a report and brainstorm solutions.

Evelyn welcomed the silence.

She changed into something comfortable and checked her phone.

A cheerful emoji from Serena greeted her. Evelyn smiled and sent one back.

There were also messages in the company group chat—Victoria and Isabella checking if she’d arrived safely.

Evelyn replied briefly, omitting the banquet drama. She claimed jet lag had knocked her out.

Then she checked Alexander’s messages.

Nothing.

Her fingers hovered over the screen, itching to text him. But after a moment’s hesitation, she deleted the draft.

If he couldn’t be bothered to message her first, why should she?
###Chapter 312

The screen remained dark for too long.

Evelyn couldn't resist unlocking her phone again.

In this day and age, there was no shame in a woman making the first move. She repeated it like a mantra in her head.

This material belongs to N?velDrama.Org.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard before she could second-guess herself.

"I made it!"

Sent.

No take-backs.

Silence.

Not even a typing bubble.

Her cheeks burned. She'd put herself out there, and now she was just... floating in digital limbo.

Evelyn jabbed at her own message, desperate to recall it.

Too late.

Damn it.

The sudden vibration in her palm startled her.

Alexander Kensington's name flashed across her screen.

Her thumb hovered over the answer button—then jerked back.

Wait.

Answering too fast would be pathetic. Obvious.

Three agonizing seconds later, she swiped right before he could hang up.

"Hello?" She infused her voice with deliberate nonchalance.

"Seven hours and thirty-three minutes." His voice was rough velvet.

"What?"

Blinking, she replayed his words.

"You're seven hours and thirty-three minutes late."

She could practically see him checking his watch. "Accounting for flight duration, ground transit, and reasonable rest periods—you're still five hours overdue."

A beat of stunned silence. Then—

"You hypocrite!" Evelyn sputtered. "You're just as late! Seven and a half hours, to be exact!"

Her nails dug into the comforter.

If he'd been tracking her flight this whole time, why hadn't he texted first?

"I was in back-to-back meetings." A weary sigh crackled through the speaker. "Just finished."

She heard the clink of a coffee cup.

The timing was too perfect—his call coming right after her text.

"Fine. Apology accepted." The fight drained out of her.

"Have you eaten? There's an excellent bistro near your hotel." Keys clacked in the background. "Sending you the address now."

"If you think it's good, it probably costs a month's rent." She flopped onto the bed, pouting at the ceiling. "I'll just order room service."

A low chuckle. "Use my card."

Evelyn scoffed, stretching her hand toward the empty air. "Oh? And how exactly do I do that? Materialize it through the phone?"

Thousands of miles separated them. The absurdity made her grin.
###Chapter 313

"There's a CK credit card with no password in the middle compartment of your luggage. You can use it."

To Evelyn's surprise, Dominic said that.

Evelyn quickly got up and searched through her suitcase.

Sure enough, she found a sleek CK credit card with gold accents. It didn’t look like any ordinary card.

"When did you put this here?"

"It doesn’t matter. As long as you can use it."

After a brief pause, he continued, "Being out there isn’t easy, so make sure you eat well and get enough rest. Take care of yourself when I’m not around."

His words warmed Evelyn’s heart, filling her with an unfamiliar sense of security.

She had always prided herself on her independence, ever since she was young.

Now, there was someone who genuinely cared—someone who worried about whether she was eating properly or sleeping enough. Her well-being had become his priority.

"Of course. You too," Evelyn murmured softly.

Dominic chuckled, then suddenly remembered something. "By the way, I heard the organizers invited Harrison Whitaker. He’s… difficult. If you run into him, try to avoid any confrontation."

Evelyn fell silent, replaying the day’s events in her mind.

Noticing her hesitation, Dominic’s pulse quickened. He asked cautiously, "Don’t tell me you’ve already met him?"

"...Yes."

Evelyn exhaled and recounted everything that had happened earlier.

When she finished, it was Dominic’s turn to go quiet.

"Are you upset with me?"

At first, Evelyn hadn’t thought much of her actions. But now, hearing herself describe the encounter aloud, she wondered if she should’ve been more diplomatic—especially when dealing with someone as influential as Harrison Whitaker.

Still, if given the chance to do it over, she probably wouldn’t have acted differently. She could tolerate many things, but blatant disrespect toward perfumers from Veridia wasn’t one of them.

"Not at all," Dominic said, rubbing his temples. He knew her fiery temperament well—but he hadn’t expected her to cross paths with Harrison Whitaker on her very first day.

Even Dominic couldn’t have predicted that.

He continued, "It worked out in the end, didn’t it? Mr. Whitaker didn’t lose his temper, and you weren’t kicked out."

"True. I owe that to Serena," Evelyn admitted.

"Without her, I might’ve been escorted out today," she added with a wry smile.

Of course, she knew that was unlikely.

As a top-tier perfumer, Harrison Whitaker wouldn’t have made such a scene in front of so many people—no matter how angry he was.

Besides, Evelyn wasn’t the one at fault.

The organizers had been careless.

Harrison’s anger stemmed from public embarrassment, not her.

Kicking her out would’ve only made him look worse.

"Still, it’s because of you," Dominic pointed out. "If you hadn’t made those connections years ago, things might’ve ended differently today."

He was genuinely surprised by Evelyn’s network. "I never expected you to be friends with Harrison Whitaker’s daughter."

Countless people had tried—and failed—to get close to Harrison, hoping to ride his coattails to fame.

Yet Evelyn had befriended his daughter without even realizing it.

"I had no idea Serena was his daughter. When we met, she was just a shy, quiet girl. I never imagined she was related to Harrison Whitaker."
###Chapter 314

Evelyn was stunned. She didn’t have many friends, but fate had led her to cross paths with one here in Valmont—and not just any friend, but someone of immense influence.

"Well, this is unexpected, but consider it a stroke of luck," Alexander remarked, his voice laced with relief.

At the very least, with this connection, Harrison Whitaker wouldn’t be too harsh on her.

"What kind of luck is this?" Evelyn muttered, tilting her head back to stare at the ceiling. "I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. Whether I compete or not, it’s going to end badly for me."

"Are you scared?" Alexander swiveled his chair toward the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing out at the glittering cityscape. The night was alive with lights, but he had no desire to return home.

Without her there, he’d rather bury himself in work at the office.

"Scared? I’ve faced worse," Evelyn scoffed. "I can’t control what people say about me. But I can control what I do—and I’ll do what I have to."

Despite her complaints, her mind was already made up. She couldn’t change her circumstances, but she had never backed down from a challenge before.

Why should she withdraw from the competition just because of gossip? She had entered this industry for her love of perfumery, not for approval or fame.

If Evelyn had cared about public opinion, she would’ve crumbled when Dominic Reeves and Vanessa Blake had conspired against her.

Her defiance made Alexander chuckle. "Do whatever you want. I’ve got your back."

Those words were all the reassurance she needed. Knowing someone was standing behind her, no matter what, lifted a weight off her shoulders. She wasn’t fighting alone anymore.

A sharp knock interrupted her thoughts. At first, Evelyn thought it was at her door, but then she realized it was coming from Alexander’s end of the call.

"Sounds like someone’s looking for you. We’ll talk later," she said, hanging up before he could respond.

Alexander frowned as the office door swung open.

"Come in."

"Mr. Kensington, it’s Ms. Winslow," Harrison announced, his expression uneasy.

The woman stormed in before he could finish, her voice sharp with irritation. "Ha! I knew Alex was here. Why did you try to stop me, Harrison? What kind of secretary are you?"

"Ms. Winslow—"

Alexander straightened in his seat and waved a hand, signaling Harrison to leave. The secretary hesitated but finally stepped out, closing the door behind him.

Cassandra Winslow wore Chanel’s latest slim-fit trench coat, the epitome of fall fashion. She shrugged it off, revealing a sleek black dress that clung to her curves like a second skin.

She sauntered forward, a smirk playing on her lips—until she glanced back at the door and scowled. "Honestly, Harrison’s slipping. He can’t even close a door properly."

Just as she reached for the handle, Alexander’s voice cut through the air.

"Leave it open."
###Chapter 315

Cassandra Winslow's hand froze mid-air.

She turned slowly, flashing Alexander Kensington a bright smile.

"Alright, we'll play by your rules."

Crossing to the executive desk, she set down her designer tote and unzipped it with deliberate care.

Inside rested an oversized thermal container.

"I know how you get when you're working - completely forgetting basic human needs like eating."

She snatched the half-empty coffee cup from his desk and dumped its contents into the wastebasket.

"Black coffee on an empty stomach? Really, Alex? Even interns know better."

With a dramatic flourish, she popped open the container's lid.

Steam curled upward, revealing perfectly glazed ribs and golden fried chicken. The rich aroma of smoked paprika and honey glaze filled the office instantly.

"I remembered how much you loved the BBQ ribs from The Canopy. Got their signature fried chicken too."

Beaming, she arranged silverware before him with unnecessary ceremony. Propping her chin on both hands, she gazed at him with exaggerated expectancy.

Alexander arched one eyebrow. "You prepared this yourself?"

"Obviously! Come on, taste it already," Cassandra urged, her smile widening until her eyes nearly disappeared.

"You cooked?"

His repetition wasn't a question but an accusation. Those piercing gray eyes dissected her expression like a surgeon's scalpel.

Cassandra huffed, pushing back from the desk with enough force to make her Valentino heels click sharply against marble.

"Fine! It's from The Canopy's takeout! Happy? I literally just landed from Paris this afternoon - when exactly was I supposed to whip up a gourmet meal? Between jet lag and unpacking, I'm surprised I managed to change out of my travel clothes!"

"Nobody expected you to cook."

Alexander snapped the container shut with finality and slid it toward the desk's edge.

"You should be resting. Harrison can drive you home."

"I wanted to see you." Cassandra's voice turned petulant as she watched him reject the food without even a courtesy bite.

"Does it matter if I didn't cook it? I still went out of my way to bring you dinner. Since when do you turn down food from The Canopy?"

"Not hungry." His tone remained glacial. "It's late. Harrison will take you home."

"I'm not leaving!"

Her perfectly manicured nails dug into the desk's edge. "If takeout offends your delicate sensibilities, let's go out. Right now. My treat."

Before he could react, she'd circled the desk and seized his wrist with both hands.

"Midnight supper, Alex! Just like we used to!" The whine in her voice was calculated, perfected through years of getting her way.

She'd gone straight from the tarmac to The Canopy precisely for this excuse. Six months apart, and he thought she'd leave after five minutes? Not a chance.

"Cassandra. Enough." He peeled her fingers away with deliberate slowness.

"It's nearly midnight. You should be home recovering from your flight."

"I don't want to!"

The outburst echoed through the empty executive floor.

"You're really going to do this? I fly halfway across the world, and you can't even spare an hour? Six months, Alex! Six months since I've seen you, and this is the welcome I get?"

Alexander massaged his temples. "It's not safe for you to be wandering around at this hour."

"Since when do you care about curfews?" she shot back.

"Because I like you! The entire Kensington empire knows it! Is it a crime to want to see you?"

Her declaration would have scandalized any remaining staff.

Alexander's gaze turned arctic.

"I've told you before - you're like a sister to me. If you can't accept that, then stop pretending we have some sibling bond."

The Winslows and Kensingtons ran in the same elite circles.

Their grandfathers had built empires together. Old Man Kensington still owed the Winslow patriarch a life debt from some long-ago business crisis.

The families were practically woven together - Cassandra's aunt had married Alexander's uncle, making them cousins by marriage if one traced the connections closely enough.
###Chapter 316

Cassandra Winslow’s feelings for Alexander Kensington were no secret.

No matter how many times he turned her down, she refused to give up. In her mind, his continued bachelorhood was proof enough—he had to care for her.

He only treated her like a sister because their families were close, but deep down, he loved her. That stubborn belief kept her going. One day, she would win his heart.

Sooner or later, he would be hers.

Seeing the stormy look on his face now, though, Cassandra faltered. She bit her lip, fingers tightening around his sleeve.

"Fine. I haven’t seen you in months, and I miss you. Must you be so cold?" Her voice trembled. "I even brought you a late-night snack. You don’t appreciate it—no, you scold me instead."

Her lower lip jutted out. Tears shimmered in her eyes, threatening to spill.

Alexander exhaled, pinching the bridge of his nose. "You’re not a child anymore, Cassandra. Stop this."

He glanced at the clock. "You’ve been away for half a year. Your family must be worried. Go home."

"They don’t care!" she snapped, frustration boiling over. "All they think about is business. And now you’re just like them!"

She snatched up the takeout container, shoving it toward him. "Eat. Then I’ll leave."

Her glare dared him to refuse.

"Cassandra—"

"Please."

His jaw tightened. He knew her intentions were good, but indulging her would only feed false hope. Better to crush it now.

Without another word, he stood, grabbing his coat. "Harrison."

The door opened immediately. His assistant had been waiting outside.

"Escort Ms. Winslow home."

Cassandra’s face paled. He wouldn’t even humor her this much? Did he think she’d poisoned it?

"Alexander Kensington, I hate you!" She hurled the container into the trash with a clatter. "Let the dogs have it, then!"

She stormed out before Harrison could react.

Alexander didn’t move.

"Sir…?" Harrison hesitated.

"Follow her. Make sure she gets home safely."

As much as she infuriated him, she was still family friends. If anything happened to her tonight, the blame would land on him.

Harrison nodded and rushed after her.

The scent of food still hung in the air. Alexander’s stomach growled. He was hungry.

Keys in hand, he checked the time.

Evelyn would be awake now, halfway across the world in Laurentia. Probably eating, too.

He’d grab something quick. And for a moment, he could pretend they were sharing a meal together.
###Chapter 317

His assumption was spot on.

Evelyn Carter was absolutely prepared for dinner.

At first, she had planned to settle for something simple, but Alexander Kensington’s recommendation piqued her curiosity.

To Evelyn, the pleasures of life weren’t limited to crafting exquisite perfumes—indulging in fine cuisine was just as essential.

Food had to meet her expectations.

She had considered inviting Adrienne Laurent, but as she neared the assistant’s door, she hesitated.

The thought of enduring nonstop nagging throughout the meal made her reconsider.

Evelyn abandoned the idea and opted to order takeout for Adrienne instead. She hailed a cab and gave the driver the address of a restaurant at random.

Evelyn was, in fact, fluent in the Laurentian language.

Even if she were alone, communication wouldn’t be an issue—though few were aware of this skill.

Dominic Reeves himself might not have known she spoke multiple languages.

Evelyn had always been a quick study. She learned them purely out of interest—it made researching foreign fragrance ingredients and spice histories far easier.

Since she needed the knowledge, she mastered it.

It wasn’t something she felt the need to flaunt, so she never mentioned it.

Dining alone in a restaurant, ordering and eating by herself, felt much like traveling solo—comfortable, yet undeniably lonely.

As she sipped the rich red wine, she found herself missing Alexander more than ever.

"Evelyn!"

A familiar voice called out, followed by a bright, energetic figure appearing before her. "What a coincidence! I’d say this is fate! Here for dinner too?"

Evelyn hadn’t expected to run into Serena Whitaker again so soon. The odds were uncanny.

"Yes, a friend recommended it, so I thought I’d give it a try," Evelyn replied with a nod.

"Of course, this place is amazing!"

Serena beamed with pride before asking, "Have you tried anything yet? How is it?"

"It’s decent," Evelyn admitted. She had ordered the signature dish, which was enjoyable—though she still preferred home-cooked meals.

Serena was visibly delighted to see her.

She leaned in slightly and lowered her voice. "I didn’t think I’d run into you again so soon! I assumed I’d have to wait until tomorrow. By the way, are you here alone? Didn’t you come representing the company? Shouldn’t you have an assistant handling things for you?"

Evelyn arched a brow at the mention of the assistant she’d left behind.

"She’s resting at the hotel."

Adrienne was probably still fretting over tomorrow’s competition.

"Then your assistant is slacking! She should be taking care of your meals, transportation, wardrobe—everything! How could she just relax while you’re out dining alone?"

Serena’s disapproval was evident.

"I told her to rest," Evelyn clarified, rubbing her temple lightly. "I wanted some time alone."

Serena’s smile faltered slightly. "Oh… Am I intruding?"

"Not at all. It’s been a while since we last met. I’m happy to see you," Evelyn reassured her with a smile. "Are you here by yourself?"

Serena blinked, as if suddenly remembering something. "Oh! I completely forgot—I have an appointment!"

She glanced toward the interior of the restaurant. "I should go. Let’s catch up properly another time!"

"Of course," Evelyn agreed warmly.

With a quick wave, Serena hurried off.

Evelyn watched as she made her way to a table where another woman was already seated.
###Chapter 318

The afternoon sun streamed through the windows of The Canopy, casting golden patterns across the white linen tablecloths. Across from Evelyn Carter, a woman sat with her young son—a boy no older than six, dressed in a miniature blazer, carefully maneuvering his knife and fork like a seasoned gentleman.

He was adorable.

When he caught Evelyn’s gaze, he peeked up from his plate, offering a shy, dimpled smile before ducking his head again. Her heart melted instantly.

A memory surfaced—Alexander Kensington’s teasing voice, warm and low, whispering in her ear after she’d brought home those wooden carvings. A son and a daughter, Evelyn. Wouldn’t that be perfect?

She had scoffed then. But now, watching this little boy, the idea didn’t seem so absurd.

Smirking, she pulled out her phone and snapped a picture of her plate—seared scallops drizzled in truffle oil, vibrant greens, a glass of crisp white wine. She sent it to Alexander with the caption: Food envy yet?

Given the time difference, she expected silence. The message was more for herself—a small indulgence in missing him.

Her phone buzzed almost immediately.

A photo of a perfectly cooked ribeye, glistening with herb butter, accompanied by creamy mashed potatoes. His reply: Likewise.

She huffed a laugh. The man knew exactly how to provoke her. That steak was her weakness.

Gripping her phone, she typed back: Midnight snacks lead to love handles, Mr. Kensington.

His response was instant. Already married. Who cares?

Cheeky. She fired back: I’ll demand a refund if you ruin that physique.

No returns. Final sale.

She was about to retaliate when—

CRASH.

The sharp sound of shattering glass cut through the hum of conversation. Chairs screeched. Gasps erupted.

Evelyn spun in her seat.

Behind her, chaos unfolded. A woman was on her knees, sobbing. A small body convulsed on the floor—the same sweet boy who had smiled at her moments ago. His face was ghostly pale, lips tinged blue, limbs jerking violently.

"Serena?!" Evelyn shot to her feet, rushing forward.

Serena Whitaker—her friend—stood frozen, hands pressed to her mouth, eyes wide with panic. "Evelyn, I—I don’t know what happened! He just—he collapsed!"

The boy’s mother wailed, clutching his tiny hand. "Please, someone help!"

The restaurant staff hovered uselessly, one already on the phone with emergency services.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. She dropped to her knees beside the child, fingers already checking his pulse.

"Let me see."

The world narrowed to the boy’s shallow breaths, the tremors wracking his small frame.

And the terrifying realization—this wasn’t just a faint.

Something was very wrong.
###Chapter 319

Evelyn knelt swiftly, her fingers brushing against the child's flushed skin. Beads of sweat dotted his forehead and neck, his tiny body trembling uncontrollably.

When she pressed her palm to his back, damp fabric clung to her touch. His breathing was shallow, erratic. Worse still—angry red splotches bloomed across his cheeks.

"He's having an allergic reaction," Evelyn announced, already working at the buttons of his shirt.

"Get away from him!" Penelope shrieked, clawing at Evelyn's wrist. "Who do you think you are?"

Evelyn didn't flinch. "If we don't act now, he could stop breathing." Her voice was steel.

Serena, pale but resolute, caught Penelope's arm. "She's a friend, Penelope. She knows what she's doing."

Whether it was fear or reason that won out, Penelope's grip slackened. Her sobs were the only protest left as Evelyn bared the boy's chest.

The rash was worse than she'd feared—a wildfire of inflammation.

"What did he eat?" Evelyn demanded, scanning the crowd.

Penelope hiccuped. "Just—just orange juice and a croissant. Was it poisoned?" She whirled toward the waitstaff, venom in her glare. "I'll ruin this place if my son—"

"Enough!" Evelyn's shout cut through the panic. "Clear the area—he needs air! And bring water. Now!"

Chaos rippled through The Canopy. Servers scattered, guests murmuring as one rushed forward with a pitcher.

Serena hovered, doubt flickering—until she met Evelyn's steady gaze.

No time for hesitation. Evelyn scanned the table, rejecting the silverware. Too risky.

Instead, she plunged her fingers into the water, then into Oliver's mouth, pressing deep against his tongue.

Penelope's scream was shrill. "Are you insane? Get your hands off—"

A wet gag cut her off. Evelyn yanked back as Oliver vomited, the acrid stench sending bystanders recoiling.

Penelope retched into her palm, turning away.

"Here." Serena thrust a glass forward.

Evelyn tipped it to Oliver's lips, coaxing small sips between his weak coughs. Gradually, the tremors subsided. His color improved, though his eyes remained shut.

Evelyn exhaled. "Where's his epinephrine pen?"

Penelope blinked, dazed. "He—he doesn't have allergies."

Silence.

Evelyn's jaw tightened. The unspoken truth hung between them: You didn't know your own child.
###Chapter 320

"Is this woman truly the mother of this child? How could she not know about his allergies?" Evelyn studied Penelope with confusion swirling in her gaze. Penelope could only offer a helpless smile in return.

Just then, the ambulance arrived. Medical personnel rushed forward, examining the boy before carefully loading him into the vehicle.

Evelyn exhaled in relief as the professionals took over. She wiped her hands clean and turned to settle the bill, ready to leave—until Penelope suddenly seized her sleeve.

"You can't go! You're coming to the hospital with me!"

"Penelope!"

Serena gasped. "You can't do this! Evelyn is my friend!"

"I'm sorry, Serena," Penelope said, her voice tight with desperation. "I need her to come with me, regardless. Oliver's condition is still uncertain. What if what she did earlier made things worse?"

"No, it didn't. I trust Evelyn completely," Serena insisted, her faith unwavering.

Penelope gave a bitter laugh.

"Your trust means nothing if something happens to him. You know I can't face Donovan if Oliver isn't okay. I took him out without permission today. If anything goes wrong, I—"

"I understand your position, Penelope, but Evelyn—"

"I'll go."

Evelyn's voice was calm, cutting through the tension. She had already grasped the heart of their argument—Penelope feared her intervention might have harmed the child.

But Evelyn had no choice. Severe allergies could trigger anaphylaxis, and Oliver was just a boy. Without immediate action, the consequences could have been fatal. She couldn’t stand by and watch him suffocate.

"Evelyn..."

Serena shot her an apologetic look.

Evelyn shook her head. "It's fine. I get it. A mother's worry is understandable."

Even so, she couldn't fathom how Penelope had been unaware of her own son's allergies. Small things could be overlooked, but this? A life-threatening reaction?

Under Penelope’s insistence, Evelyn followed them to the hospital. Serena, concerned, trailed behind.

The medical team whisked Oliver into the emergency ward, leaving the three women to wait outside.

Penelope was a mess—pacing, trembling, her nerves frayed. Serena's soothing words did little to calm her.

Evelyn watched silently. The fear in Penelope's eyes was unmistakable.

"How could a mother not know?"

Maybe it was an oversight. Maybe this was Oliver’s first allergic reaction, and Penelope had simply been caught off guard.

Evelyn’s thoughts spiraled. Raising a child was no easy feat. The idea of having her own one day had once crossed her mind—but now, it evaporated entirely.

Then, footsteps.

Sharp, rapid, echoing down the corridor. The crisp click of leather shoes against tile.

Before Evelyn could turn, she saw Penelope freeze, her face draining of color.
###Chapter 321

Penelope's panic was entirely different from what she had displayed before.

Fear and anxiety were etched across her delicate features.

Evelyn turned curiously and saw several men approaching.

The one leading them wore rimless glasses and a bespoke suit.

The men behind him were clearly assistants and bodyguards.

His expression was calm, exuding an air of refined elegance.

From his appearance, he seemed to be of Asian descent.

"Donovan, you're here! Please, let me explain!"

Despite her terror, Penelope rushed toward Donovan Blackwood, tears welling in her eyes as she tried to embrace him.

A bodyguard swiftly blocked her path.

Donovan regarded her coldly. "Where's Oliver?"

"He's still in the emergency room. I don't know how this happened. We were having such a wonderful time today, and he was happy—but then suddenly... I don't know... I really don't know... sob..." Penelope stammered between sobs.

Evelyn arched a brow, speechless.

Are they a couple? But what kind of couple acts like this? It was bizarre.

She glanced at Serena, seeking answers.

Serena remained impassive, as if this were completely normal.

"Penelope, I warned you not to meet Oliver alone. Clearly, you chose to ignore me," Donovan said icily. "If anything happens to him, I will destroy you."

His tone was steady, but every word dripped with menace.

Evelyn felt a chill grip her heart. She looked at Penelope, who had collapsed to her knees, trembling uncontrollably.

"No! You can't do this to me!"

Penelope burst into fresh tears.

"I'm his mother! You have no right!"

Donovan gazed down at her with disdain. "Do you deserve any better?"

Evelyn was stunned.

Good grief. What a ruthless man.

Penelope continued weeping on the floor.

Then, abruptly, she seemed to remember something. She whirled around, pointing an accusing finger at Evelyn, her purple manicured nail glinting under the harsh hospital lights.

"No—it wasn't me! It was her!"

"Excuse me?" Evelyn blinked.

"She did something strange to Oliver earlier! If he's hurt, it's her fault! She's the one to blame!"

Any sympathy Evelyn had felt for Penelope evaporated instantly.

This woman absolutely deserves this.

Of course someone treated so pitifully had done something to earn such hatred.

Evelyn couldn’t believe Penelope was trying to pin this on her. The child's condition was still unknown—the doctors hadn’t even given an update yet.

If the worst happened, it would be due to a severe allergic reaction, not her first aid. How could Penelope possibly blame her?

Evil suited her far better than Penelope.

Donovan's sharp gaze locked onto Evelyn. She met his eyes unflinchingly, her conscience clear.

She had nothing to fear.
###Chapter 322

"You can't accuse Evelyn, Donovan. She saved Oliver, and I can vouch for that!"

Serena seemed to know this man well and immediately defended Evelyn, clearly shocked by Penelope's behavior.

"Serena."

He acknowledged her with a nod, his demeanor polished. "Is this your friend?"

"Yes, she is! Evelyn saved Oliver—she didn’t harm him. I swear it!"

Penelope, standing nearby, scoffed. "Is she a doctor, Serena? How can you be so sure she didn’t make things worse? Maybe Oliver was fine before she interfered. She even shoved her filthy fingers into my son’s mouth—"

Donovan’s gaze sharpened at her words.

This material belongs to N?velDrama.Org.

"What exactly did you do to him?"

"She forced her hand into Oliver’s mouth and tore open his shirt! It wasn’t me—it wasn’t me, Donovan! Why would I ever hurt my own child?"

Penelope scrambled to explain, her voice trembling.

"If you objected, why didn’t you stop her then? Evelyn was clearly trying to help! How could you twist her intentions like this?"

Serena, who had considered Penelope a friend, was seething. She had pitied Penelope before, but now she saw her for what she truly was.

There was no question—Evelyn had acted to save the boy.

At that moment, everyone had been frozen, unsure what to do.

Evelyn was the only one who stepped forward.

Regardless of the outcome, her intentions had been pure.

Yet Penelope was determined to paint her as a villain. How could she be so cruel?

"I—I was just panicking at the time..."

Penelope’s voice dropped to a whisper, her excuse weak.

Donovan ignored her, his piercing gaze locked on Evelyn. "Explain. What did you do to my son?"

His expression was unreadable, his emotions perfectly masked. He carried himself with the quiet authority of a man used to command.

"The symptoms suggested a severe allergic reaction. In an emergency like that, identifying the allergen wasn’t possible. Immediate action was necessary to stabilize him before the ambulance arrived. I induced vomiting to reduce the allergen in his system and gave him water. I loosened his collar because severe allergies can restrict breathing—it was to make him more comfortable."

Evelyn met his eyes without flinching. "That’s all. Whether you believe me or not is up to you, Mr. Blackwood."

Donovan didn’t respond immediately. His silence was heavy, the air around them growing thick with tension.

For a moment, time seemed to stand still.

There was something about him—something eerily reminiscent of Alexander Kensington. A presence that demanded respect without a single word.

Just his stare was enough to make people straighten instinctively.

Men like him were born leaders. No wonder Penelope was terrified.

But Evelyn had nothing to hide. She wouldn’t be made a scapegoat.

Finally, Donovan spoke. "Thank you."

Serena exhaled in relief.

Evelyn remained composed. "You’re welcome."

Penelope, however, looked as if she’d been struck. "You’re taking her word over mine? You’d trust a stranger instead of me—the mother of your child?!"

"I’ve told you before," Donovan said coldly, "you don’t deserve that title."

Just then, the emergency room doors swung open. A doctor stepped out.

"Family of the child?"
###Chapter 323

Dominic stepped forward, his polished shoes clicking against the hospital floor. "I'm his father, Donovan Blackwood."

The doctor adjusted his glasses, his expression grave. "Your son has a life-threatening allergy. You must monitor his diet meticulously to prevent accidental exposure. This is absolutely critical."

Evelyn had been right about the symptoms all along.

Though not medically trained, her experience with severe allergic reactions had proven invaluable.

Once assured that young Oliver was stable and transferred to a recovery room, Evelyn turned to leave.

"If everything's under control, I should be going."

"Wait." Donovan's commanding voice stopped her mid-step as he blocked her path. "You saved my son. Name your price."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

"That's unnecessary. I just did what anyone would do. The real hero here is the medical team." She gestured toward the doctors, completely uninterested in any reward.

"You're refusing compensation?" His piercing gaze studied her. "Money? Connections? Whatever you need, I can make it happen."

"Evelyn," Serena whispered urgently, pulling her aside. "Donovan Blackwood practically owns Crestview. This is an opportunity most people would kill for."

Evelyn had already guessed as much. The way Donovan carried himself, the effortless authority in his voice - this was a man accustomed to power.

Yet she needed nothing from him.

His arrogant demeanor sparked mischief in her. "Mr. Blackwood, since you insist... Have you heard of the perfume 'Eternal Bloom'? Not money, not favors - just this one particular fragrance. Think you can manage that?"

"Eternal Bloom?" Donovan's eyebrows shot up, as if questioning his own hearing.

"Yes," Evelyn confirmed with a sweet smile. "Now if you'll excuse me, it's getting late."

She gave a polite nod and walked toward the elevators.

Serena hurried after her. "Evelyn, wait! I'm coming with you!"

There was no reason for Serena to stay now.

As the elevator doors closed, Serena huffed. "I can't believe Penelope's behavior! I actually felt sorry for her before, thinking she was just an unfortunate woman. Clearly, Donovan had good reason to leave her."

"They're separated?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

While she typically avoided gossip, their earlier interaction had been impossible to ignore.

"Technically never together. They had Oliver, but were never married. Penelope's been clinging to the relationship ever since." Serena shook her head. "I was actually considering helping her reconcile them. Now I see Donovan made the right choice!"

Evelyn remained silent. She'd met them only once - their personal drama wasn't her concern.
###Chapter 324

The afternoon sun cast golden rays through the window as Evelyn Carter adjusted her sunglasses.

"Right, the perfume you asked for—is it a new release? I've never heard of it," Harrison Whitaker remarked, his brow furrowing slightly.

As a world-renowned perfumer, he expected his daughter to at least recognize major fragrances.

But Serena Whitaker had never cared much for perfumes.

In her own words, she lacked both the talent and the interest.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "No, it's not new. Quite the opposite—it's so old that it's practically extinct."

"Wait—then isn't that an impossible request for Donovan?"

Serena's eyes widened in disbelief.

Evelyn tilted her head, a sly curve playing on her lips. "Not entirely impossible if he truly puts in the effort. But..."

This particular fragrance was the very first perfume ever created by Celestia Group over a century ago—a symbol of national pride.

It had been encased in an ornate crystal bottle, a masterpiece of craftsmanship.

Now, it existed only in history.

The last two remaining bottles were displayed in a museum in Veridia, guarded like priceless relics.

No amount of wealth could buy them.

Evelyn had always been intrigued by it, yes.

But she knew Donovan Blackwood would never be able to procure it.

The real reason behind her request?

A lesson—that some things were beyond even his vast influence.

She never actually expected to possess Eternal Bloom.

After hearing her explanation, Serena exhaled sharply. "Evelyn, you never cease to amaze me."

"Do you have any idea how powerful Donovan is in Crestview? No one dares to mess with him."

Evelyn shrugged, unfazed. "I'm not messing with him. He offered me a reward. I simply stated my desire. Whether he can fulfill it is up to him."

A beat of silence.

Okay, maybe I am toying with him a little.

But she hadn't forced him to agree.

Serena shook her head. "You may not have forced him, but knowing Donovan, he'll move heaven and earth to get it now. If he fails, it'll be a blow to his pride."

Evelyn hesitated. "That serious?"

"Absolutely. Men like him? Their pride is everything."

Serena's tone left no room for doubt.

Evelyn winced. "I didn't think that far ahead. Next time I see him, I'll tell him I changed my mind."

It would be awkward to backtrack now.

"Hey, remember that impossible perfume? Just kidding—how about cash instead?"

Serena burst into laughter, clapping Evelyn on the shoulder. "When did you become this mischievous?"

Evelyn grinned. "Maybe I've just been hiding it well. Pity you figured it out now."

As they stepped out of the elevator, Evelyn's phone buzzed insistently in her bag.

She pulled it out, glancing at the caller ID.

Adrienne Laurent.

A headache instantly formed.

The moment she answered, Adrienne's voice flooded through.

"Ms. Carter, it's getting late! Where are you? I've been calling and texting—no response! Do you know how worried I've been? At least give me a heads-up next time! Where are you now?"

Evelyn checked her watch.

Late indeed.

"I'm still out, but I'll be back soon," she replied smoothly.

Adrienne exhaled in relief. "Good. Please hurry. It's not safe for a woman to be out alone at night. I'll wait for you at the hotel."

With the competition looming, they still had much to discuss.
###Chapter 325

Adrienne Laurent sat rigidly in the hotel suite, her sleek tablet balanced on one knee and a stylus poised between her fingers. The sharp click of her heels against the marble floor betrayed her impatience as she waited for Evelyn Carter to return.

When the door finally swung open, Evelyn blinked in surprise at the sight of her assistant looking every bit like a corporate executive about to storm a board meeting.

Guilt prickled at Evelyn for having indulged in a solo dinner without bringing anything back. With a sheepish smile, she gestured Adrienne inside.

"Adrienne, have you eaten? I can call for room service if you're hungry."

Food usually softened the tension in any conversation, but Adrienne shook her head briskly.

"No, thank you. I already ate. Let’s get straight to business."

Evelyn poured herself a glass of water, the cool liquid soothing her throat as she took a long sip.

"Alright, go ahead. What’s the plan?"

She knew Adrienne had spent the entire afternoon locked in her room, strategizing. The woman wouldn’t have rushed over like this without a fully formed proposal.

"I’ve consulted with DR Holdings," Adrienne began, her tone clipped. "The consensus is that you should participate in tomorrow’s sampling event."

Her gaze sharpened, ready to counter any resistance.

Evelyn merely nodded.

"Sure. I’ll do it."

Adrienne’s fingers froze mid-tap against her tablet. "That’s it? No arguments?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Why would I argue?"

"So… you’re confident in your skills?" Adrienne ventured cautiously.

"If I weren’t, the company wouldn’t have sent me. Besides," Evelyn swirled the water in her glass, "I’m curious to see what the other perfumers can do."

Adrienne nearly groaned.

DR Holdings had dispatched Evelyn with the expectation that she’d at least promote the brand, if not secure a win. Yet here she was, treating the event like a casual experiment.

"You’re representing the company," Adrienne pressed. "You need to aim for a win." She barely stopped herself from adding first place—that was too ambitious.

"I’ll do my best, but results aren’t guaranteed," Evelyn replied with infuriating calm.

Adrienne’s jaw tightened.

How is this your best when you were out gallivanting until sunset? But she swallowed the remark.

"Fine. Given your… connection with Mr. Whitaker, there will be scrutiny. The company has PR statements prepared to mitigate backlash. Don’t let online chatter upset you."

Evelyn shook her head.

"Don’t bother. Over-explaining will only fuel speculation. And honestly, the company shouldn’t waste resources on damage control. Redirect those funds to R&D."

Adrienne stared, stunned by Evelyn’s stubbornness.

Here she was, trying to protect Evelyn’s reputation, and the woman was dismissing it outright.

With a sigh, Adrienne snapped her tablet shut. "If that’s your decision, then good luck tomorrow, Ms. Carter. Get some rest."

Evelyn exhaled in relief as Adrienne stood.

But at the door, Adrienne paused. "One more thing—this city isn’t as safe as Veridian. If you go out, tell me first. Keeping you safe is part of my job."

Evelyn arched a brow but nodded. "Noted."

For all her nagging, Adrienne was undeniably thorough. And beneath that corporate exterior, she genuinely cared.
###Chapter 326

The digital clock on the nightstand glowed 2:47 AM when Vanessa finally ended her call. The hotel room was silent except for the faint hum of the air conditioning.

Then came the knock.

Sharp. Insistent.

Vanessa's fingers tightened around her phone as she approached the door. Peering through the peephole, she saw him—Lucien Dubois, leaning against the doorframe with a half-empty bottle dangling from his fingers.

She opened the door just enough to glare at him. "What do you want?"

Lucien smirked, his dark eyes glinting with something dangerous. "Is that any way to greet an old friend?"

"Friend?" Vanessa scoffed. "It's the middle of the night. Go back to your room."

He pushed past her before she could stop him, the scent of whiskey and something sharper clinging to him.

Vanessa clenched her fists. "Lucien, remember why we're here. This isn't the time for your games."

Lucien laughed, low and mocking. "Oh, I remember. You wanted this trip. You promised me results. And yet..." He spread his arms. "Here we are, empty-handed."

She stepped back as he advanced. "Evelyn Carter isn't some naive girl anymore. She's under Harrison Whitaker's protection now."

"Harrison Whitaker?" Lucien sneered. "She's just friends with his daughter. That means nothing."

Vanessa's gaze flickered over his flushed skin, the unnatural brightness in his eyes. Not just drunk. High again.

Disgust curled in her stomach.

"Lucien, you're not thinking straight. We'll talk tomorrow." She tried to sidestep him, but his hand shot out, gripping her wrist.

"Tomorrow?" His breath was hot against her ear. "I want my payment now."

Vanessa shoved against his chest, but he was stronger, his body pressing her back toward the bed.

"Stop!" She twisted, but his grip was iron.

For a moment, she considered screaming. But then she remembered—she still needed him.

So she swallowed her rage and let him have his way.

When morning came, Vanessa stood under the scalding shower, scrubbing until her skin burned.

But some stains wouldn't wash away.

As she dressed, her eyes fell on Lucien, still sprawled across her sheets.

A cold resolve settled in her chest.

Evelyn Carter would pay.

And so would he.
###Chapter 327

Vanessa emerged from the bathroom, a practiced smile playing on her lips.

Lucien was already awake. He rolled onto his side, his gaze sharp and alert—nothing like the haze of last night.

"Good morning," she purred, settling onto the sofa beside the bed, the bath towel clinging to her damp skin. "Now that you're up, shall we discuss business?"

"What is it?"

Propping himself up on one elbow, Lucien studied her with detached curiosity.

"The competition begins today," Vanessa said, crossing her legs deliberately. "What are your plans?"

"Hmm?"

He feigned ignorance.

Vanessa leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "I intend to win first place."

Only victory would secure Wesley Whitaker's recognition. Only then would her name echo across the industry. This was her chance—one she couldn’t afford to waste.

Lucien's eyes gleamed with something dark, almost amused, as if she were a peculiar specimen under glass.

After a long pause, he burst into laughter. "Vanessa, darling, wake up. This isn’t Veridian City. Do you honestly think I can snap my fingers and hand you the trophy? Here, you’re nothing. A nobody." His words were brutal, leaving no room for negotiation.

She had expected this. Instead of anger, a slow, mocking smile curved her lips. "True. I’m insignificant here. But tell me, Lucien… what does that make you?"

His expression hardened. "Explain yourself."

"Oh, I’ve discovered some fascinating things," she drawled, tilting her head. "Lucien Dubois, the so-called genius perfumer. Turns out, we’re more alike than I thought."

She let the words hang, savoring the tension.

"I used Evelyn’s work to climb. But you? Your entire reputation is built on stolen ideas. Awards, designs—all plagiarized. We’re both frauds, aren’t we?"

"Watch your tongue."

Lucien shoved off the bed, yanking his trousers on with sharp, angry motions. "Spreading lies won’t benefit you."

"Lies?" Vanessa laughed. "You know the truth. You might’ve fooled Veridia, but the industry abroad sees you for what you are. Tell me, why did no one acknowledge you at last night’s gala? Why no special treatment from the organizers?"

She had dug deeper after noticing the snubs. What she uncovered was delicious.

Lucien wasn’t a master—he was a thief. Caught multiple times, his scandals buried under money and connections. But here, in Valmont, his past whispered in every shadowed corner.

Vanessa’s chest tightened with bitter regret. She had burned bridges for him. Destroyed years of effort. And for what?

A fraud.

Worse—she had sacrificed Dominic for this.
###Chapter 328

"You had me investigated?"

Lucien pulled a cigarette from his pocket, lit it with a flick of his wrist, and exhaled a slow stream of smoke. His eyes gleamed with something unreadable.

"Of course. But don’t worry—I won’t use it against you." Vanessa smiled, her voice as smooth as silk. "After all, we’re allies now. Our interests align, don’t they?"

Her expression remained gentle, almost sweet, but there was steel beneath it.

"What do you want?"

Lucien wasn’t naive. She wouldn’t have revealed this without a purpose.

"I’ll do what I can. But the first prize in the perfumery competition? That’s beyond my control."

Vanessa tilted her head, amusement dancing in her gaze. "Who says it is?"

She stepped closer, her fingers brushing his sleeve as she lowered her voice. "Rumor has it that last year’s competition was a foregone conclusion—until you won. People whispered about cheating, but no one could prove a thing."

Lucien took another drag, his jaw tight. Silence stretched between them.

"That’s why I believe in you," she murmured. "This is Valmont—your domain. You have your methods, don’t you?"

Her breath was warm against his ear. "It’s just a competition. If we knew the questions ahead of time… wouldn’t that make things easier?"

Vanessa wasn’t delusional. On her own, she’d be lucky to make the shortlist, let alone win.

But with the right advantage? The game changed.

Cheating in perfumery was supposed to be impossible—it was all about the nose, after all. But if no one could truly measure another’s senses, then where were the lines drawn? Every competition had its loopholes.

And men like Lucien proved they existed.

He finished his cigarette, grinding it beneath his heel. "What’s in it for me?"

Vanessa’s smile sharpened. "After the competition, I’ll deliver Evelyn to you. Do whatever you please."

Lucien chuckled, but his eyes remained cold. "Really? You couldn’t touch her in Veridia. What makes you think you can here?"

"If I uncovered your secrets, don’t you think I have my ways?"

She leaned back, feigning nonchalance. "In Veridia, I was the obvious suspect. Here? No one would suspect me."

"You hired someone."

It wasn’t a question.

Vanessa shrugged. "My methods are my own. The point is—we both get what we want. I gain prestige. You get revenge."

Lucien scoffed. "I’m not an idiot. What if she fights back? Sues me? Or worse—with her skills, she could ruin me."

He wasn’t about to risk his career—or his life—for fleeting satisfaction.

Vanessa rolled her eyes. "Where’s that cunning of yours? If she resists… make sure she can’t."
###Chapter 329

Lucien Dubois raised a skeptical brow. "Explain yourself."

Vanessa Blake's lips curled into a smile, though her eyes remained cold. "Don't you have that one thing that brings you joy? Share it with her. Once she experiences it, she'll crave it—become dependent. She won't be able to walk away from you then, will she?"

Understanding dawned in Lucien's gaze. He gave her shoulder an approving pat.

"A woman's heart truly is the deadliest poison," he mused, tilting his head. "Why don't I give you a taste? Let me show you what happiness feels like." His voice dropped as he leaned in, aiming for her lips.

Vanessa jerked back with a scoff. "I'm being serious, and you're joking? That thing is precious. Save it for Evelyn—let her enjoy it."

Lucien arched a brow but didn't push further.

Still, her words sparked an idea. He sank into a chair, all traces of teasing gone. "Fine. Then what's our next move?"

Alexander Kensington was jolted awake by his ringing phone.

He scowled, groping blindly for the device before pressing it to his ear. "What?"

A honeyed female voice chirped through the line. "Alex! Rise and shine! I brought breakfast. Tell security to let me in!"

He squinted at the clock. 6:47 AM. He'd only just dropped her off past midnight. Cassandra Winslow had the energy of a hyperactive puppy.

"Hold on."

He shoved off the bed, sliding his feet into slippers. "Hand the phone to the guard."

"Fine!" Cassandra huffed, shoving the device at the uniformed man. "I told you to open the gate earlier. Do you even know who I am? Ridiculous!"

Alexander had every intention of letting her in—until he spotted Evelyn's shoes tucked under the bed.

Reality slammed into him.

He wasn't alone anymore.

Women's belongings were scattered everywhere. If Cassandra saw them... He didn't care if she knew he was married. But he'd promised Evelyn discretion.

And Cassandra? She'd dig until she unearthed every secret.

When the guard took the phone, Alexander changed tactics. "Don't open the gate. Have her wait. I'll be right out."

Cassandra heard him—thanks to the speaker. Her face twisted. "Excuse me? Alex, I'm not—"

He hung up.

Outside Crestview Heights' gates, Cassandra stomped her Louboutin-clad foot. Luxury communities were annoying—no entry without an access card or owner approval.

She'd put effort into this! Her floral sundress, the red Porsche, the artisanal pastries from that exclusive patisserie. Last night's snack rejection was one thing, but breakfast?

Yet here she was—barred at the gates like some commoner.

Alexander dressed swiftly. Evelyn's shoes by the door made his chest tighten. God, I miss her.

He pulled up to the gates, rolling down his window. Cassandra stood there, pouting in her designer dress.

"Hand it over," he said. "I'm heading to the office."

She thrust the pastry box forward—then yanked it back. "Wait. You're going to work? What about me?"

"Go home." His tone brooked no argument. "You just got back. Spend time with your family instead of stalking me."

"I want to stalk you!"

Her lower lip jutted out. "Alex, this is unfair! I woke up at dawn for this. You didn't even let me inside. At least let me eat with you before you ditch me!"

###Chapter 330

Alexander glanced at Cassandra's car parked haphazardly by the curb.

"I'm heading to the office. Why don't you come with me?"

He already knew she would insist on driving separately—she always did.

To his surprise, the moment the words left his mouth, she dashed to the passenger side, flung the door open, and slid into the seat with a delighted squeal.

"Okay, okay!"

"What about your car?" Alexander arched a brow.

"Who cares? Just leave it!" She waved a dismissive hand. "I'll ride back with you tonight and pick it up then."

Oh my God! She clapped her hands in silent glee, thrilled at the prospect of sharing a car with him.

"It might get towed before we return," Alexander pointed out dryly.

"Let it." She shrugged. "Even if it does, I'll just have someone retrieve it. Anyway, Alex—what do you feel like eating? I wasn’t sure if your tastes changed, so I brought a few options. Take your pick!"

Beaming, she thrust a carefully packed bag toward him like it was a treasure chest.

The corner of Alexander’s mouth twitched.

Then his gaze snagged on the small bottle of car fragrance tucked in the cup holder—Evelyn’s handmade blend, meant to freshen the space.

Seeing Cassandra sitting exactly where Evelyn usually did sent an uncomfortable prickle down his spine.

"Get out and sit in the back," he ordered.

Cassandra blinked. "Why?!"

"The passenger seat isn’t safe."

He scrambled for an excuse. "And you’re distracting me with all that food."

"I—"

She faltered, then smirked, eyes glinting. "Is it really the food bothering you… or is it me? Are you finally admitting I affect you, Alex?"

"You’re imagining things."

He flicked her forehead. This girl’s mind was a maze of wild theories. Only she could twist a simple request into some grand romantic confession.

"Hahaha!"

Even with the light scolding, Cassandra’s mood soared. She clung to the belief that she was the real distraction—and that suited her just fine.

Grinning, she grabbed the door handle but paused before opening it.

"You won’t drive off the second I step out, right? No tricks!"

Alexander exhaled. "I won’t. Just move to the back."

"Okay!"

Only after his reassurance did she hop out and slide into the rear seat.

When he checked the rearview mirror, her face was lit with triumph. He had no idea what she found so amusing. Shaking his head, he started the engine and pulled onto the road.

The office building was nearly empty at this hour. Taking the private elevator to the top floor, Alexander planned to finish breakfast quickly and send her on her way.

Better yet, he needed to find some urgent task to occupy her—anything to keep her from clinging to him all day.

Cassandra, oblivious to his scheming, was too busy floating on cloud nine.

The fact that he’d let her tag along to work and share a meal spoke volumes.

Is he finally acknowledging me as his girlfriend?

Bringing a woman to the office was practically a public declaration. He wouldn’t do that unless she meant something to him.

Right?
###Chapter 331

The morning wasn't unfolding as Cassandra had envisioned. Alexander devoured his breakfast with startling efficiency—no lingering conversation over steaming coffee, no playful banter across the table. Just a single sandwich, one black coffee, and he was already back at his desk, fingers flying across the keyboard.

The monitor absorbed Alexander's attention completely. Cassandra picked at her food, the flavors dull without his engagement. Unable to bear the silence, she abandoned her plate and marched to his side. "Alex, do I even exist to you right now?"

His eyes flicked up briefly before returning to the screen. "What do you need?"

"Need?" Her lower lip jutted out. "Do you despise me?"

"Of course not."

"Then why are you treating me like wallpaper?"

"Work."

"Liar!" Her voice hitched. "You're not that busy. You just refuse to spare me five minutes. Is sharing a meal with me really such a chore?" Fury propelled her forward—she grabbed the monitor and swiveled it away.

Alexander's brow furrowed as he finally met her glare. "Enough."

He held up the last crust of his sandwich, popped it into his mouth, and dusted his hands. "Breakfast concluded. Harrison can drive you home." He reached for his phone.

Cassandra slammed her palm over his. "No! I won't be pawned off to Harrison like some errand!" She leaned in, eyes blazing. "You take me. Yourself."

Let him say no. Then I'll stay. Even if we just breathe the same air—

"Fine." Alexander's agreement sliced through her scheming. "I'll drive you."

The concession stunned her. "You're... eager to get rid of me?" Her composure shattered. She'd risen at dawn, battled bakery lines, all for this? His indifference cut deeper than any insult.

Though never cruel, his polite detachment was its own cruelty.

"Cassandra," he sighed, "we're adults. I have responsibilities. You must have your own pursuits." The chiding tone—paternal, patronizing—ignited her temper.

"Exactly! I'm not a child, so stop lecturing me! Sebastian already plays the brother role perfectly—I don't need a stand-in!" She whirled toward the door, tossing over her shoulder, "Enjoy your solitude. Don't come crawling back."

Alexander didn't stir as the door slammed. Only then did he lift his phone, dialing a number that rang interminably.

A groggy voice finally answered. "Do you own a clock? This better be life-or-death."

"Your sister," Alexander said dryly, "delivered breakfast to my penthouse, then invaded my office. At dawn."

Sebastian's chuckle crackled through the line. "Efficient as always. My condolences." A yawn. "Wake me when she proposes."

"She's gone. Upset. And carless."

That snapped Sebastian awake. "Wait—she drove to you. Where's her car? And what did you do? You didn't chase her?"

Silence stretched. Somewhere, a car horn blared—Cassandra's Uber, perhaps. Alexander watched the empty doorway, jaw tight. The monitor's glow reflected in his unreadable eyes.
###Chapter 332

"I'm swamped. Plus, I have a business trip coming up," Alexander Kensington said flatly.

"You're seriously going to ignore my sister's safety just because you're busy?" Sebastian Winslow's voice crackled through the phone, sharp with frustration.

Alexander scoffed. "Funny. You're the one who keeps reminding me she's your sister."

A beat of silence passed before he continued, his tone clipped. "She's not a child anymore. Maybe you should tell her to stop dropping by my office unannounced. Gossip spreads fast—it won’t do her reputation any favors. And honestly, shouldn’t she be on set filming right now?"

Sebastian’s breath hitched as realization struck.

"You’re avoiding her, aren’t you?" His voice dropped, accusatory. "You know how she feels about you. My parents would be thrilled if you two got together. What’s the problem? Just tell me straight—are you seeing someone else?"

Alexander exhaled slowly, the silence stretching between them.

"Cassandra is your sister. To me, she’s just a kid I grew up with." His tone brooked no argument. "I’ve got to go. Find her yourself."

Without waiting for a response, he ended the call and immediately dialed another number.

"Book me the earliest flight to Laurentia. I want to leave today."

For the first time in years, work felt unbearably dull.

Life is colorless without her around.

The Veridian City Perfumery Competition wouldn’t begin until evening, leaving participants the morning to rest.

While others scrambled with last-minute preparations—cramming theory, refining techniques—Evelyn Carter chose to meditate, her breathing steady, her mind clear.

Her assistant, Adrienne Laurent, however, was a bundle of nerves.

Adrienne had spent the morning pacing, making frantic calls to DR Holdings’ executives, her gaze flickering to Evelyn every few seconds as if waiting for a meltdown.

Evelyn suppressed a smile. She knew exactly what Adrienne was thinking: Why isn’t she panicking? But the poor woman was too afraid to voice it, lest she jinx Evelyn’s focus.

Amused, Evelyn let her stew.

Near midday, Victoria Sterling called.

"The competition’s tonight, right?"

"Cut to the chase," Evelyn teased, glancing at Adrienne, who was now wringing her hands.

Victoria groaned. "I know you’re not nervous, but could you at least pretend for Adrienne’s sake? She’s been blowing up my phone all morning. The woman’s a wreck."

Evelyn bit back a laugh. "I’m not—"

Then, noticing Adrienne’s wide-eyed stare, she straightened, adopting a convincingly tense tone. "Okay, fine. I am nervous. But I’ll manage. Don’t worry—I’ll make Celestia Group proud."

Adrienne’s shoulders sagged in visible relief, her clenched fists finally loosening. Evelyn barely stifled a chuckle.

"Thank you," Adrienne breathed, rushing over to massage Evelyn’s shoulders. "You’ll do great. The company chose you because they believe in you. Winning would be amazing, but even if you don’t—"

She cut herself off, superstitious.

"—just relax! No pressure!"

Evelyn blinked. She’s been dying to say that all day, hasn’t she?

Still, she played along. "You’re right. I feel better now."

Adrienne beamed, oblivious to the fact that Evelyn had never been nervous at all.
###Chapter 333

The perfumery competition wasn't exactly the most prestigious event in the industry.

It was more of a talent hunt—a platform for fresh faces to shine.

Only independent perfumers and representatives from emerging companies were invited.

NouveauDrama.Org hosted the event.

Solo participants received preferential treatment—they were exempt from the first round.

That meant fewer competitors in the initial stage.

As Phoenix Labs' representative, Evelyn Carter had no choice but to start from the beginning.

The task was straightforward.

Five perfume bottles.

Identify the ingredients and base notes by scent alone.

Child's play for Evelyn.

Victoria Sterling had once given her a similar test—except hers was ten times harder.

Evelyn finished quickly.

She expected a high pass rate, but nearly a third of the participants were eliminated.

So much for an elite-only competition.

The real shock?

Vanessa Blake made it through.

"Guess she hasn't completely wasted her years," Evelyn mused.

What she didn’t know?

Lucien Dubois had secured the answers through questionable means.

Vanessa had simply memorized them.

The second round—a written exam on fragrance theory—would begin that evening.

Half the remaining contestants were cut after this brutal test.

Only a handful advanced to the finals.

The organizers arranged flights home for the losers.

The finalists had three days to kill before the last challenge.

Evelyn groaned internally.

"Adrienne Laurent is definitely going to babysit me the whole time."

She could already feel the boredom creeping in.

Then, like clockwork, entertainment arrived.

"Didn’t expect you to last this long," Vanessa sneered, flipping her hair. "Phoenix Labs must’ve invested a fortune in training you."

Evelyn gave her a sidelong glance—the kind reserved for circus clowns.

"Why the surprise? Even you managed to scrape through."

Vanessa’s smirk didn’t waver.

"Jealousy doesn’t suit you. I passed on merit."

For once, she didn’t explode in rage.

Instead, she purred, "The finals will decide everything."

Evelyn shrugged.

"We’ll see."

She turned to leave, but Vanessa blocked her path.

"Think you’ve already won?"

Evelyn’s lips curved.

"I don’t know about the others, but against you?"

She let the implication hang.

Vanessa’s face darkened.

"Arrogance doesn’t become you."

Evelyn laughed.

"Confidence is earned. Do you have any?"

With that, she walked away, leaving Vanessa fuming.

Outside, Adrienne waited impatiently.

The real challenge?

Surviving the next three days without losing her mind.
###Chapter 334

Evelyn walked past Vanessa and headed straight for the exit.

God knows why she stopped me. If she tries to frame me again, it’ll be a nightmare.

As soon as she stepped outside, she spotted Adrienne rushing toward her, her face alight with excitement. The girl was practically vibrating with joy, though she was clearly trying—and failing—to contain it.

"Congratulations, Ms. Carter!"

The results of the first two rounds had been announced immediately after the judges finalized them, but participants were required to remain inside the venue a little longer.

Evelyn found Adrienne’s struggle to keep her composure amusing. She reached out and pinched the younger woman’s cheeks, startling her.

"Let me give you some advice."

"What?"

"Don’t call me Ms. Carter next time."

It was rare for anyone to address her so formally, and it felt oddly stiff. The suggestion made Adrienne freeze for a second.

"What should I call you, then?"

"How about my name?"

Adrienne blinked. "Evelyn?"

"You’re getting there!"

Evelyn patted her head approvingly.

To her, Adrienne was just a colleague with different responsibilities.

Beyond being meticulous and professional, Adrienne had been nothing but kind to her.

In Laurentia, she had handled everything—accommodations, transportation, meals—without a single misstep.

Evelyn could focus entirely on her work, and that was largely thanks to her.

Since everything was going smoothly, she was in a good mood and indulged in a bit of teasing before turning to leave.

Just then, a sleek black car pulled up in front of her.

A man stepped out and approached.

"Ms. Carter?"

"Yes, that’s me." She nodded.

"We’ve been instructed to escort you."

His English was flawless, his tone polite. But his oversized sunglasses obscured most of his face, making it impossible to read his expression.

"Who sent you—?"

She hesitated, though she already had a suspicion.

The only person she knew here with that kind of influence was her.

"Ms. Serena Whitaker."

She was right. But why would Serena want to see her now? The competition had just ended.

She didn’t mention anything about meeting up.

"Ms. Whitaker said she has something urgent to discuss with you, but she couldn’t risk calling directly during such a sensitive time. She thought you’d understand after seeing this."

He extended his hand, revealing a familiar ring—one Serena always wore.

"So she doesn’t want me to call her?" Evelyn asked.

"Ms. Whitaker said she’ll explain everything in person."

He opened the car door. "Time is limited, Ms. Carter. Please, get in."

"Ms. Carter!"

Adrienne hurried after her, still defaulting to the formal address out of habit.

"Where are you going? It’s late."

"Serena needs to see me."

Evelyn glanced back. "I might have to go with them."

"Ms.—"

Adrienne hesitated, eyeing the towering, broad-shouldered man before pulling Evelyn aside.

"The rumors about you and Mr. Whitaker are already spreading. Meeting Ms. Whitaker now would be… unwise. I think you should decline."
###Chapter 335

Adrienne Laurent was naturally cautious, but her instincts were right this time.

Yet Evelyn Carter’s refusal wasn’t solely about avoiding gossip. Meeting Serena Whitaker at such a sensitive moment could spark unnecessary rumors.

Even if Evelyn didn’t care, it would still tarnish Serena’s and her father’s reputations.

Evelyn studied the man before her and suggested, “How about this? I’ll call Serena and discuss things over the phone.”

The man remained silent, so Evelyn pulled out her phone and dialed Serena’s number.

The call didn’t connect.

“Ms. Whitaker is in a difficult position, Ms. Carter. We hope you’ll understand,” the man explained.

At first, Evelyn wanted to refuse, but the failed call and the sight of Serena’s ring in the man’s possession made her uneasy. What if something had happened to Serena?

After a brief hesitation, she relented.

“Fine. I’ll go with you.”

“Wait!”

Adrienne, realizing she couldn’t stop Evelyn, rushed forward.

“If you’re going, then so am I.”

“Ms. Whitaker only requested Ms. Carter’s presence.”

The man clearly didn’t want Adrienne tagging along.

“I just want to see what’s going on. I’ll call you if anything happens. Be right back.” Evelyn gestured with her fingers, promising to contact Adrienne.

But Adrienne stood firm. “No. I won’t let you out of my sight right now, no matter what. If you’re worried about Ms. Whitaker, I’m coming with you.”

“Adrienne…”

Evelyn started to protest, but the man cut in, “Ms. Carter, time is running out. Your assistant can come if she insists.”

Since they allowed Adrienne to join, Evelyn didn’t argue further as they climbed into the car.

The interior was spacious.

Aside from the driver, only Evelyn, Adrienne, and the man who had spoken to them earlier were inside. He had fallen silent since they entered, and the atmosphere grew heavy.

A faint scent lingered—likely from an air freshener.

Evelyn tried calling Serena again, but her phone was now completely turned off.

“What’s really going on with Serena?”

The unanswered call and the switched-off phone only deepened Evelyn’s concern.

“Ms. Whitaker is facing some trouble and hopes you can assist her.”

“What kind of trouble? Does Mr. Whitaker know about this?” Adrienne pressed.

If it was something serious, shouldn’t Serena seek help from her father, who had influence in this city?

Evelyn had no connections here. How could she possibly help?

“Ms. Whitaker said you’re the only one who can help her, Ms. Carter.”

The man’s vague answers frustrated Evelyn. “Where is Serena right now?”

He looked at her, his eyes obscured behind dark sunglasses.

After a beat, he replied, “Ms. Carter, why so many questions? You’ll find out when we arrive.”

“You—”

Adrienne started to retort but suddenly swayed, pressing a hand to her forehead as she shook it violently.

“You guys…”
###Chapter 336

Adrienne collapsed mid-sentence before she could finish speaking.

"Adrienne?"

Evelyn frowned as she called out her assistant's name.

She grabbed Adrienne's arm and shook it twice. "What's wrong with you?"

Halfway through her own words, Evelyn's vision blurred. She stared at the figures before her, realization dawning. "You're not the team Serena sent."

Then, darkness swallowed her, and she slumped over Adrienne's unconscious form.

"Took you long enough to figure it out," Ivan sneered.

The car sped toward a remote location.

Midway, they switched vehicles, ensuring no trail could be followed.

After weaving through multiple routes, they finally halted in front of a secluded wooden cabin.

The driver cut the engine and stepped out.

Ivan shoved the door open and leapt from the car.

Each man hauled one woman over his shoulder and marched toward the cabin.

The door creaked open before they reached it. "You weren't followed, were you?"

Ivan scoffed at the question and barged inside.

The driver followed, while the third man lingered, scanning the surroundings before shutting the door. He flicked off the bright overhead lights.

His gaze dropped to the two women sprawled on the floor.

Frowning, he asked, "Weren't we only supposed to take Evelyn? Why are there two? Unless they're both Evelyn?"

Their client had been very specific—Evelyn Carter. No mention of a second target.

No extra pay for bonus hostages.

Ivan jutted his chin toward Adrienne. "That's her assistant. Stubborn little thing insisted on tagging along. Guess she's out of luck now."

Viktor, the bearded man who had opened the door, crouched for a closer look.

His thick brows knitted together. "This is her?"

The client had warned them repeatedly—use heavy sedatives, triple the dosage.

They'd laced the air with enough knockout fragrance to drop an elephant.

Thankfully, they'd taken the antidote beforehand.

And still, the client had stressed—bind Evelyn tightly.

Over and over, like she was some kind of superhuman threat.

But the woman before him looked fragile. Delicate.

Ten of her wouldn't stand a chance against him, especially drugged and restrained.

Now, seeing her lifeless form, a twinge of concern pricked him.

He pressed two fingers to her neck. A steady pulse.

"Still breathing," he muttered.

Turning to the others, he ordered, "Get the ropes."

The driver rolled his eyes. "Seriously? She's out cold."

They weren't common thugs. Their names were on Interpol's most wanted list.

But this client? Overpaying and overcomplicating things.

Viktor shrugged. "Client's orders."

Maybe the guy had peculiar tastes.

He selected a thin cord and secured Evelyn's wrists, leaving Adrienne untouched.

Then, they dumped each woman into separate rooms.

Now, they waited.

For the ransom.

For the payoff.

And hopefully, no surprises.
###Chapter 337

Viktor Petrov made the call after securing the girls in the locked room.

"We have her. When do we get paid?"

"Did you restrain her properly?"

The voice on the other end was laced with tension.

"Relax. We always deliver what our clients ask for."

Viktor paused, then added with a dark chuckle, "Even if she weren't tied up, do you really think Evelyn Carter could escape?"

"Better safe than sorry."

The client wasn't taking any chances. Even if the odds were slim, failure wasn't an option.

Viktor scoffed. "When are you coming?"

"Not for another two days. Keep her hydrated but limit her food intake. And don't forget the injections."

Viktor hesitated before replying, "Shouldn't you handle that part?"

"I'm tied up here. Just follow my instructions. I'll pay extra if you administer the doses on schedule."

The man's voice was cold, leaving no room for negotiation.

"Fine."

Viktor hung up, satisfied. Money was all he cared about.

With Interpol closing in, he needed a hefty sum to disappear. This job was easy—quick cash with minimal risk.

"Dmitri, go check on them. Make sure they're still out."

Dmitri Sokolov grumbled under his breath. "After that much sedative? A bear wouldn't wake up, let alone two girls."

"Just do it!"

With a sigh, Dmitri grabbed two water bottles and headed to the rooms.

Adrienne Laurent was still unconscious, her position unchanged.

"Told you."

He moved to Evelyn's room. She lay motionless, her delicate features almost peaceful.

Annoyed at being scolded for nothing, Dmitri slammed the door shut.

"When's the client getting here, boss? This is boring. Let's wrap it up."

"Patience. Two more days. He'll come—he’s already paid the deposit."

Viktor tore into a piece of jerky, chewing aggressively.

"Did you get what I asked for?"

Dmitri and Ivan exchanged uneasy glances.

"We don’t deal with that stuff, boss."

They were criminals, but they had lines they wouldn’t cross.

"Nobody’s asking you to use it. Just prep the syringe and administer it."

Viktor’s gaze flicked toward Evelyn’s door.

Dmitri let out a low whistle.

"Damn. This client’s ruthless."

Not just kidnapping—he wanted her broken. Addicted. A puppet.

Even they had limits.

"Enough chatter. Ivan, you do it."

Viktor didn’t trust Dmitri’s soft spot for pretty faces.

Dmitri smirked at Ivan.

"Good luck, man. When she wakes up begging? You’ll fold."

He’d seen her face. Gorgeous. A shame, really.
###Chapter 338

Viktor shot Dmitri a warning glare before growling, "Don't even think about it. Keep your hands to yourself and stick to the client's instructions!"

Dmitri pouted, irritation flashing in his eyes.

"I was just making an observation. What a waste."

To everyone's surprise, Ivan nodded in agreement. "Yeah."

Viktor and Dmitri both turned to stare at him, eyebrows raised.

Ivan finished preparing the syringe, tapping the needle lightly before standing. "I'll administer the injection."

"Ivan." Viktor stopped him with a firm tone.

"Don't overdo it. If you kill her by accident, we won’t have anything to show the client."

Ivan gave a curt nod and strode toward Evelyn’s room. He pushed the door open, his gaze landing on the woman lying motionless on the bed.

She had the delicate frame typical of an Asian woman, yet her curves were undeniable. Her bare arms, pale as porcelain, rested limply at her sides. She didn’t seem to have stirred yet.

He moved to the bedside, flicking on the lamp before studying her face. Setting the tray down on the nightstand, he perched on the edge of the mattress. His fingers trailed lightly over her leg, sliding upward with deliberate slowness. His throat tightened as his eyes followed the path of his hand, stopping just before reaching a forbidden area. His fingers twitched, frozen mid-air.

"Don't move."

A blade pressed against his ribs, sharp enough to slice through fabric and into skin before he even registered the movement.

Evelyn—who should have been unconscious—was now wide awake, her restraints undone.

"Who are you?" she demanded coldly, sitting up with lethal grace.

Ivan smirked but stayed silent.

In a flash, he twisted, fingers aiming for her slender throat.

He ignored her threat.

It didn’t matter how she’d woken up or freed herself. A woman her size shouldn’t have been a problem for someone like him.

But reality struck hard.

Evelyn dodged his grasp, ducked low, and spun behind him in one fluid motion.

Before he could react, the knife was at his throat, its edge biting into his skin. Ivan’s expression darkened, his earlier confidence crumbling.

Even behind his glasses, the shock was unmistakable.

How could this petite woman overpower him so effortlessly? He’d been in this business for years.

He’d underestimated her—but his counterattack should have been foolproof.

"Answer me!" Evelyn’s voice was ice.

The blade pressed deeper, drawing a thin line of blood. One more ounce of pressure, and it would slice through flesh.

"Who..." Ivan swallowed hard.

"Who are you?"

It finally clicked why the client had insisted on heavy sedation and restraints.

But the realization had come too late.
###Chapter 339

"Do you really think you're in any position to ask questions?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smirk as she pressed the blade deeper into Ivan's throat.

The sharp sting of metal breaking skin sent a wave of panic through him. The realization that death could come in the next second made his defiance crumble.

"W-Wait! Let's—let's talk this through!"

"Fine. Then talk. Who sent you?"

Evelyn tilted her head slightly, her voice deceptively calm.

From the moment she got into the car, something had felt off.

Serena would never have reached out so abruptly without warning. If she were truly in trouble, she would have called her father first—not Evelyn.

But Serena’s phone had gone dead, and that could only mean one thing: this wasn’t about Serena at all.

They had come for her.

So Evelyn played along, waiting for the right moment to strike and uncover who was behind this.

"We don’t reveal our employer," Ivan ground out after a tense pause.

"How noble," Evelyn mocked, tapping the flat of the blade against his cheek. "But tell me—do you value your life more than your professional ethics?"

Ivan clenched his jaw, the veins in his forehead bulging.

She could see the fear in his eyes. He wasn’t fearless—he just knew the consequences of breaking the rules.

In this line of work, betraying your employer meant exile. No second chances.

But Evelyn wasn’t in the mood for patience.

"You’d rather die than talk?"

The knife slid across his throat, drawing a thin, deliberate line of blood.

She controlled the pressure perfectly—enough to hurt, not enough to kill.

Ivan hissed through his teeth, his composure cracking.

Yet he stayed silent.

Evelyn exhaled sharply—then froze.

Footsteps.

Someone was coming.

"Fine. If you won’t tell me, someone else will."

Before Ivan could react, Evelyn struck the base of his skull with the hilt of the knife.

His body slumped to the side, unconscious.

She quickly bound him with the rope from earlier, then dragged him toward the bed. He was heavy, and time was running out.

With no better option, she yanked the blanket over him just as a knock sounded at the door.

"Ivan, don’t push your luck."

It was Dmitri.

He must have gotten suspicious when Ivan didn’t return.

Their employer hadn’t ordered anything extreme—just a simple abduction. If Ivan got carried away, it would be his head on the line.

Viktor had sent Dmitri to check.

Evelyn moved silently, barefoot, knife in hand.

Her gaze locked onto the door.

"Ivan, Viktor said not to rough her up too much. If you damage the merchandise, the boss won’t be happy."

Another knock.

No answer.

Dmitri sighed and turned the knob.

The door swung open.

The room was dim, lit only by the bedside lamp.

Dmitri’s eyes landed on the lump under the blanket, and he smirked.

"Damn, you work fast. But don’t get too—"

He stepped closer, intending to pull the blanket back.

Then froze.

The shape was wrong.

"Ivan?"

A whisper of movement behind him.

Dmitri barely had time to turn before cold steel pressed against his throat.

"Now," Evelyn murmured, her breath warm against his ear. "Let’s have a real conversation."
###Chapter 340

Evelyn watched as Dmitri bent slightly, his fingers brushing against the soft fabric of the discarded jacket.

A sudden tension gripped the air.

Just as he began to turn, his body froze mid-motion. His hips locked in place, muscles refusing to obey. Panic flashed across his face as he strained against invisible restraints.

His head remained immobile, eyes darting wildly. When he tried to scream, only silence emerged - his vocal cords paralyzed by the same unseen force.

'What's happening to me?' The terror in Dmitri's eyes was palpable.

Evelyn had planned this carefully. First immobilize, then interrogate. But she'd underestimated his reflexes. The scream building in his throat forced her to act faster than intended.

One by one, she took control of his bodily functions. There would be time for questions later.

Upstairs, Viktor grew suspicious. The prolonged silence was unnatural. His hand drifted to the concealed weapon at his hip as he ascended the staircase.

"Damn it! What are you two idiots doing?" Viktor's voice boomed through the hallway. "Get your asses out here now or there'll be hell to pay!"

He kicked the door with enough force to send it crashing against the wall.

The scene before him made his blood run cold.

Dmitri stood frozen like a statue, eyes wide with terror but mouth slack and silent. The unnatural stillness sent chills down Viktor's spine.

"Volkov? Sokolov?"

Viktor's grip tightened on his gun, finger hovering over the trigger. The door swung fully open, revealing the dimly lit room.

A shadowy figure stood with its back to him.

"Sokolov?" Viktor squinted.

The figure spun with inhuman speed. A gunshot rang out before Viktor could react.

White-hot pain exploded in his wrist. His weapon clattered to the floor.

He barely had time to register the attack before a crushing blow to his knees sent him sprawling. The sickening crack of bone echoed through the room.

As numbness spread through his limbs, Viktor managed one last look at his attacker.

His breath caught.

Her.

The fragile-looking girl stood over him, eyes cold and calculating. Impossible. She couldn't have taken them all down alone.

"Looking for reinforcements?" Evelyn's voice was ice. "There aren't any."

She knelt beside him, studying his panicked expression. "Scream all you want. No one's coming to save you."

Across the room, Dmitri remained frozen in silent horror. Nearby, Ivan continued sleeping, oblivious to the chaos.

The hunter had become the hunted.
###Chapter 341

Evelyn had barely managed to drag the three men together when beads of sweat dotted her forehead.

Moving three heavily built men was no easy feat for someone as petite as her.

It took every ounce of her strength.

Once she had secured them, Evelyn descended the creaky wooden stairs to survey the isolated countryside house.

In this remote area, screams would go unheard—no one would come to their rescue.

The fridge was stocked with enough bread and milk to last several days.

Content (C) N?v/elDra/ma.Org.

She then checked on Adrienne, who lay peacefully asleep in another room, blissfully unaware of the danger she had been in.

That was a relief.

Adrienne staying unconscious was far better than her waking up in a panic and complicating things.

Evelyn gently tucked a blanket around her before heading back upstairs.

With a flick of the main switch, the house flooded with light.

The two conscious men winced, squinting against the sudden brightness.

"Open your eyes!"

A sharp kick landed on Viktor's chest.

Evelyn pulled up a stool and sat before them, tearing off a piece of bread as she scolded, "Did I say you could close them?"

Dmitri remained silent, his mouth hanging open uselessly.

"Lady, it's a reflex! The light's too bright—we can't help it!"

"Who the hell are you?" Viktor demanded, glaring at her.

Evelyn smirked. "You kidnapped me without even knowing who I am?"

Viktor studied the girl in front of him—delicate features, an innocent face, the unmistakable beauty of Veridia.

This should have been an easy job.

Kidnap her, wait for further instructions, collect the money.

No ransom, no killing.

Just another routine mission.

Their employer had warned them, but they hadn't taken it seriously.

Now, they were paying for their arrogance.

Evelyn tilted her head. "So, who sent you?"

Viktor clamped his mouth shut.

She had expected that.

As the leader, he wouldn't break easily.

Her gaze shifted to Dmitri, who was still struggling to speak.

"He won't talk. How about you?"

Dmitri's lips moved, but no sound came out.

Evelyn chuckled. "Oh right, I forgot—you can't speak."

She stood and walked toward him.

His eyes widened in fear as she raised her hand.

A quick jab, and his voice returned.

"What are you doing?" he croaked.
###Chapter 342

Viktor Petrov's eyes widened in shock as words tumbled from his lips.

"I—I can speak! I can talk again!"

The realization hit him like a tidal wave, drowning out the danger of their current predicament. Joy surged through him, wild and unchecked.

"Bro! Look at me! I'm not mute anymore!"

"Shut your mouth!"

Dominic Reeves' voice cut through the euphoria like a blade.

Viktor snapped his jaw shut, the command instinctive.

His body, however, remained frozen. No ropes bound him, yet his limbs refused to obey. A deep, unsettling numbness had taken root.

"Why can't I move?"

Dominic's mind raced. The woman before them—Evelyn Carter—had done this.

He had heard rumors of Eastern martial arts, techniques that could paralyze with a mere touch. But seeing it in action?

Unbelievable.

And terrifying.

Evelyn tilted her head, a slow smile curving her lips. "Now that you've seen my little secret, it's only fair you share one of yours."

She leaned in, her voice honeyed but edged with steel.

"Who sent you? What's your name? Why try to kidnap me?"

Silence.

Dominic clenched his teeth. The driver, Dmitri Sokolov, wisely kept quiet.

Evelyn sighed, shaking her head. "You're not common thugs, are you? Professionals, I'd guess."

"Damn right," Dmitri muttered, pride flickering.

Her smile sharpened. "Then you're not afraid of death."

Dominic scoffed. "If you're going to kill us, just do it. We won't talk."

Rules were rules. Betrayal wasn't an option.

Besides, he doubted this slip of a woman had the stomach for murder.

Evelyn finished the last bite of her bread, washed it down with milk, and let out a satisfied sigh.

Then her eyes gleamed.

"Let's play a game."

Dmitri blinked. "What kind of game?"

Dominic elbowed him. "We're not playing anything with her!"

A sharp pain exploded in his lip.

"Ah!"

Blood welled where Evelyn's knife had nicked him—fast as a viper's strike.

Dominic hadn't even seen her move.
###Chapter 343

Viktor Petrov was silent.

His eyes widened slightly, though his expression remained eerily calm.

But the shock was undeniable. He clearly hadn’t expected someone as delicate-looking as Evelyn Carter to strike with such brutal precision.

Not only had she moved faster than he could react, but he hadn’t even seen the attack coming.

"Care to tell me now?" Evelyn tilted her head, her voice icy. "Who sent you?"

Viktor snapped out of his daze, his lips curling into a cold smirk before he turned his face away, refusing to answer.

Evelyn didn’t care.

She strode toward him, bent down, and patted his pockets until she found his phone.

Fingerprint-locked.

Without hesitation, she grabbed his limp hand, pressed his thumb against the sensor, and unlocked it. Then, with visible disgust, she snatched a tissue from the bedside table and wiped her fingers clean.

As she tossed the tissue aside, her gaze landed on a small tray left by Ivan.

Recognition flickered in her eyes.

She picked it up, settling back into the chair with the tray balanced on her lap. One hand held the phone, scrolling through recent calls, while the other idly tapped the syringe resting beside the vial of unknown liquid.

"Let me guess," she mused, her voice deceptively light. "This number? Recent contact. Not random. So… this is your boss?"

She turned the screen toward Viktor.

He didn’t even glance at it.

But it didn’t matter.

Evelyn’s attention shifted to the tray—the needle, the syringe, the small bottle of clear liquid.

She didn’t know what it was.

But she knew it wasn’t anything good.

Carefully, she filled the syringe, then attached the needle.

Now armed with both the phone and the loaded syringe, she approached Dmitri Sokolov.

She nudged him with her foot. "Still breathing?"

A pained groan escaped him as he blinked up at her, terror flashing in his eyes.

"Good," Evelyn said, shaking the phone slightly. "Then make a call."

"W-what call?" Dmitri stammered.

"Call your employer. Tell them the job’s done. Ask when they’re coming."

Dmitri swallowed hard. "H-he won’t be here for two days—"

"Shut up!" Viktor snarled.

Evelyn sighed. "Ah, right. You."

She turned, syringe glinting in the dim light. "You talk too much."

One sharp jab toward his throat, and Viktor fell silent again.

Dmitri paled, watching her like she was something out of a nightmare.

"Two days is too long," Evelyn muttered, tapping the syringe against her palm. "That messes with my schedule."

If the mastermind wanted to stop her from competing in the finals, they’d have to try harder.

"Change of plans," she decided. "Tell them I overdosed. See if that speeds things up."

Dmitri’s eyes bulged. "Y-you want me to say you’re—"

"Dead. Yes." Evelyn arched a brow. "You had no problem drugging me earlier. Don’t tell me you’re scared now."

Dmitri stayed frozen.

Evelyn sighed, lifting the syringe. "Fine. Maybe you need a little… motivation."

The needle glinted as she stepped closer.
###Chapter 344

Dmitri's face drained of color, his hands trembling uncontrollably. "P-Please, don't! I'll call him right now!"

Evelyn tilted her head, intrigued by his reaction. "What's in that syringe?"

When Dmitri hesitated, she feigned another jab toward him. He flinched violently, nearly choking on his words. "W-Wait! It's—it's a drug!"

Her expression darkened instantly. With a swift movement, she planted her boot on his chest, pressing down just enough to make him wheeze. "You're still trafficking this filth?"

"Ah—!"

Dmitri coughed violently, blood splattering onto the floor. His mind raced in frustration. Why does this always happen to me?!

"N-No, it's not ours! Our employer gave it to us! He said... he said you'd obey us if we injected you with it!"

More blood spilled from his lips as he hacked violently.

Evelyn's laughter was sharp, devoid of warmth. "Obey you?"

Her entire aura shifted—cold, predatory, like a demon emerging from the abyss. The glint in her eyes promised violence.

"Please, spare me! I don't know anything! We were just hired hands! And—and we never even got the chance to use it on you—!"

Dmitri's pleas dissolved into desperate sobs, terrified she might snap his neck without warning.

She's just a woman. How is she this terrifying? The reality was worse—three grown men, all incapacitated without a fight. Evelyn had complete control.

"H-Huh?!"

Dmitri's wail was loud enough to rouse Ivan from unconsciousness. Groaning, he shifted, the blanket slipping off his head. Then—silence.

His single eye widened as he took in the scene before him.

What the hell happened here?

"Finally awake, are we?"

Evelyn's voice dripped with venom as she turned toward him.

When she had first entered, he had been the one eager to plunge that needle into her. No—he had wanted to do far worse.

"Since you're conscious now, I'll let you enjoy this little gift." She stepped over Dmitri, advancing toward Ivan with deliberate slowness.

Ivan remained frozen, his mind struggling to process the situation. Then, his voice cracked. "What did you do to my men?!"

"Bro, I—I couldn't speak for a while," Dmitri groaned, clutching his throat.

"Couldn't speak?"

Ivan had never heard of such a thing. He pieced together that Dmitri meant he'd been rendered mute.

But how? How did one woman take down all three of us? She silenced Dmitri, beat Viktor half to death— His thoughts scattered as the syringe inched closer.

"Ms. Evelyn, let's—let's talk this out!"

Ivan pressed himself against the bedframe, breath ragged. He knew exactly what was in that syringe. One dose, and his life would be over.

Their gang had indulged in every vice—gambling, women, even violence—but never drugs. That was a line they never crossed.

"Fine. I do want to talk." Evelyn's tone softened, her demeanor shifting to something almost gentle. "But your friends weren't very cooperative. You, however, seem smarter. Call your boss. Let's make a deal, shall we?"

She smiled sweetly, the picture of innocence. No one would guess the monster lurking beneath.

Ivan hadn't witnessed her brutality firsthand—but Dmitri had, and he still couldn't reconcile the woman before him with the demon who had dismantled them without breaking a sweat.
###Chapter 345

"What do you want me to say?"

Ivan was still wearing his sunglasses. They sat slightly crooked on his face, stubbornly clinging to him despite the tension in the room.

Evelyn found them irritating. Without hesitation, she reached out and yanked them off.

The moment they were gone, she understood why he never took them off.

He only had one eye.

One sharp, piercing eye fixed on her, while the other was clouded over, completely blind. Without the shield of his glasses, his good eye burned with barely contained fury.

But Evelyn had him tied up. His struggles were futile.

"Tell your employer I overdosed from the injection. Tell him to come immediately."

She knew the mastermind didn’t want her dead—just under control. If he thought she was gone, he’d rush to confirm it himself.

"And if I do, you’ll let us go?"

Ivan’s single eye glinted with cold defiance.

Evelyn laughed. "Oh, please. You kidnapped me and my assistant, and you think I’ll just set you free? Dream on."

"Then why should I cooperate?" Ivan sneered.

On the other side, Dmitri was sweating bullets. "I—I’ll call him!"

"Brother!" Ivan snapped, disbelief twisting his face.

Evelyn smirked. "At least one of you has some sense."

She grabbed Viktor’s phone from the table and dialed the employer’s number, holding it up to Dmitri’s ear.

"If you make that call, we’re finished!" Ivan snarled. "No more jobs. No more pay. Nothing!"

Evelyn tilted her head, amused. "You think you’ll have a future after this? Worry about whether you’ll even see tomorrow’s sunrise first."

"We don’t betray our employer!" Ivan spat.

Dmitri hesitated, his hands shaking.

Evelyn sighed. "Fine. If you’d rather die than talk, that’s your choice. But have you ever heard the phrase survival of the fittest?"

Ivan scoffed. "You think threats scare us? We lost this fight, but we won’t bow to you."

"Brave words," Evelyn mused, clapping slowly. "Since you’re so proud, maybe I should make your deaths... memorable."

She paced in front of them, tapping her chin. "Let me think. How about I carve you up first? Piece by piece?"

Dmitri paled. "W-What?"

Evelyn smiled sweetly. "Oh, don’t worry. It’s simple. Just a small knife, some rope to keep you still, and a steady hand. I’ll count each cut—fair and precise. No more, no less. Want to try?"

Her grin widened as Ivan’s eye darkened with dread.
###Chapter 346

Evelyn Carter froze in fear, her breath hitching. She couldn't believe the venomous words that had just slipped from Viktor Petrov's lips—especially since he delivered them with a chilling smile.

"Unfortunately," he continued, twirling the knife between his fingers, "I don't have much experience with this. I might not get the depth right. Would you mind if I mess it up?"

"P-please don't—"

Dmitri Sokolov's eye twitched, but he forced out a sneer. "You think we're scared of you?"

"Oh, you're not?" Evelyn tilted her head, feigning admiration. "Good. Real men shouldn't be afraid. Not like little girls." She paused, tapping her chin. "Tell me, have you ever heard of how they used to interrogate prisoners?"

Dmitri stayed silent.

They didn’t want to know. But Evelyn didn’t care.

"A thick rope," she murmured, "tied just right. Tight enough to hurt, but not enough to kill. The person would still be breathing, still be conscious." She sighed dramatically. "But we live in modern times, don’t we? Equality and all that. If women could endure it, strong men like you definitely could."

The more she spoke, the paler Dmitri became. He looked seconds away from passing out.

Even if he survived this, the nightmares would haunt him forever.

Across from him, Viktor Petrov strained against his restraints, his face flushed with fury. But he couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak.

"So," Evelyn said sweetly, "have you decided? Or should I suggest something else—?"

A sharp ring cut her off.

Viktor’s phone.

Evelyn picked it up, examining the screen. The caller had saved her the trouble.

"Who wants to answer?" She dangled the phone between them.

Ivan Volkov remained silent.

Dmitri, however, scrambled forward. "M-me! I'll do it! I'll say whatever you want!"

Evelyn smirked. "Good. Don’t forget your lines."

The call connected instantly. A distorted voice crackled through.

"Well? Did you inject her yet?"

Evelyn pressed the phone to Dmitri’s ear, her gaze sharp.

Dmitri swallowed hard. "Y-you need to come! Now! Something went wrong!"

"What happened?" The voice turned urgent.

"The dose—it was too much! She—she might be dead!"

Dmitri’s voice shook, his split lip throbbing.

"WHAT?!" The caller exploded. "I told you—three days' worth! Not all at once! Are you idiots trying to ruin everything?!"
###Chapter 347

Dmitri glanced at Evelyn and deliberately raised his voice.

"How would I know what one day costs versus two? She's been kidnapped, and you didn't take her away immediately! What kind of nonsense is this? Tell me, what are we supposed to do now?"

The voice on the other end grew heated. "Where's your boss?"

"Boss?"

After a brief pause, Dmitri scoffed. "My boss is still deciding if she's worth rescuing, so hurry up and get here!"

With that, Evelyn decisively ended the call.

"Miss, did I handle that well?"

Dmitri was careful to sound submissive, not daring to provoke the woman before him.

Evelyn gave him a cold look before standing. "The three of you stay put. I'll deal with you later."

Alexander booked the earliest flight out.

He had expected to see her immediately upon arrival, but instead, he found himself unable to reach anyone.

Calls went unanswered. When he arrived at her hotel, she was nowhere to be found.

His unease grew into full-blown panic.

Alexander tapped into his contacts in Laurentia and called Phoenix Labs.

Gregory was stunned when the call came through. He hadn't expected the CEO himself to reach out.

"No, I haven't heard from them today. I'll contact them right away and update you as soon as I have news."

He hesitated, then corrected himself. "Actually, I'll update you if there's any news."

After hanging up, Gregory immediately tried calling Evelyn—but her line was dead.

Thinking quickly, he asked Victoria to track down Adrienne's number, but no one picked up.

That was when he realized the severity of the situation.

A cold sweat broke out across his forehead.

He had always assumed Evelyn and Harrison were involved—why else would the CEO personally call him?

"Mr. Kensington," he stammered when he called back, "I've tried everything, but there's no trace of her."

"Have you contacted the competition organizers?" Alexander's voice was dangerously low.

The disappointment in his tone was palpable, sending a chill down Gregory's spine.

"I did. They said she left after two rounds and vanished. There's no record of her returning to the hotel. Maybe she went out and... ran into trouble."

"Trouble?" Alexander echoed. "What kind of trouble?"

"I don't know," Gregory admitted. "I'll send someone to investigate in Laurentia immediately. I'll find answers."

"Don't bother." Alexander cut him off. "If anyone contacts you with updates, notify me at once."

"Y-yes, sir."

Gregory hung up, wiping sweat from his brow.

Outwardly, Alexander remained composed. But inside, his mind was in turmoil.

He had faced countless challenges—corporate takeovers, assassination attempts, ruthless negotiations.

None of them had shaken him like this.

He was terrified. Terrified that something had happened to Evelyn. That she might already be—

He refused to finish the thought.

He needed to act fast. Mobilize the police. Leverage every connection he had.

She had to be safe.

Evelyn, meanwhile, was growing restless.

She paced the room twice, grabbed a quick snack to replenish her energy, and checked on Adrienne.

The girl was still unconscious—proof of the drug's potency.

Had Evelyn been dosed like her, she'd be just as helpless.

After searching the room, she found no trace of her phone—or Adrienne's.

The only device available was the one confiscated from Viktor.

The interface was clunky, the functions limited.

She scowled.

This was going to be a problem.
###Chapter 348

"Where's my phone?" Evelyn demanded, her sharp gaze sweeping across the three men in the room.

Without it, she couldn't respond to DR Holdings' letter—or call Alexander Kensington back.

Even if he didn’t know what had happened to her, surely he’d be worried if she suddenly went silent, wouldn’t he?

Dmitri Sokolov pressed his lips together. "I don’t know."

"Hmm?"

A cold, threatening sound escaped her lips as her eyes narrowed on him.

He didn’t seem to be lying. Evelyn shifted her attention to Ivan Volkov, but after a brief glance at his face, she dismissed him and crouched directly in front of Viktor Petrov.

"Tell me," she said, voice deceptively soft. "Where’s my phone?"

Viktor met her gaze but remained silent. He had been paralyzed for too long—unable to move, unable to speak.

The only thing he could do was roll his eyes.

Pathetic.

They had all heard rumors about the forbidden kickboxing techniques, but none of them had ever witnessed it firsthand.

Until today.

And to think they had been bested by a woman like Evelyn Carter.

"Oh, right," she murmured, tilting her head. "You’re still frozen."

She tapped her chin thoughtfully. "Come on, Viktor. Where’s my phone? And my assistant’s?"

Viktor’s lips twisted into a grotesque grin. "It’s broken."

"Broken?"

Evelyn smiled back at him—sweet, innocent, chilling.

Then, in a flash of movement, the knife in her hand plunged straight through his palm, pinning it to the floor.

Blood pooled beneath him.

Viktor howled.

"Was this the hand that broke my phone?" she asked, her voice light, as if discussing the weather.

She twisted the dagger slightly.

"Or did I get it wrong? Should I try the other one?"

With a swift yank, she pulled the blade free.

Viktor gasped, his face contorted in pain. "I’ll kill you!" he snarled. "I swear, I’ll kill you!"

Evelyn laughed. "You’d have to move first."

She leaned closer, her breath ghosting over his ear. "One last chance. Where. Is. My. Phone?"

"It really is broken," Ivan blurted out, his single eye wide with fear.

Evelyn turned her head slowly, fixing him with a stare that made his blood run cold.

"I—I was worried about tracking," he stammered. "So I smashed it on the road. Threw it away. It’s gone."

Silence.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, twirling the bloodied dagger between her fingers. Then, with deliberate steps, she approached Ivan.

"You smashed it?"

Her voice was eerily calm.

She tilted her head, studying him like a predator examining prey. Her face was angelic, but her eyes—those were the eyes of a demon.

"I—I can get you a new one," Ivan offered weakly.

"A new one?"

Her laugh was sharp, mocking. "And what about my data? Should I take your hands as compensation?"

Before she could act, the sound of an approaching car echoed from downstairs.

All three men tensed, their eyes darting toward the door.

Evelyn smirked.

"Looks like you’re about to have company."

None of them dared to speak.
###Chapter 349

Evelyn leaned against the window frame, her gaze fixed on the approaching vehicle. A black sedan emerged from the shadows, its paint dull and chipped, making it blend seamlessly into the night.

The car screeched to a halt outside the cabin, kicking up dust.

The door flung open, and a man practically tumbled out, sprinting toward the entrance. "Viktor! Dmitri!" His voice was frantic, desperate.

Evelyn tilted her head, studying him. She didn’t need to guess—his panic was obvious.

"Oh," she murmured, almost amused, before glancing down with a faint smile.

The man stood beneath the flickering porch light, pounding on the door. "You morons! Open up! Don’t you want your damn money?!"

That nagging tone, that familiar silhouette—Evelyn recognized him instantly.

Lucien Dubois.

Of course.

But aligning himself with these criminals? That was a new low, even for him.

"Stay quiet," she hissed at the three bound kidnappers, then descended the creaky stairs, knife in hand.

Hearing movement inside, Lucien’s shouts grew louder. "Viktor! Ivan! Hurry the hell up!"

Evelyn gripped the doorknob, swinging it open and stepping aside.

Lucien barged in, barely looking. "Took you long enough—"

Then he froze.

His eyes bulged as they landed on her. Before he could bolt, Evelyn’s foot slammed into his chest.

Crack.

The impact sent him flying backward, crashing into furniture. Wood splintered, chairs toppled, and Lucien landed in a heap, gasping.

"Y-You—" He wheezed, disbelief twisting his face. "How are you—?"

"Still alive?" Evelyn twirled the knife, its blade glinting under the dim light. "Disappointed?"

"Dmitri! Viktor!" Lucien scrambled backward, his voice cracking.

Evelyn smirked. "Miss them? I can reunite you."

Lucien lurched to his feet, bolting for the door—

But Evelyn didn’t chase.

Instead, she kicked a wooden stool into her hands and hurled it.

Thud.

The stool struck his spine. Lucien choked, blood spraying from his lips as he collapsed.

Evelyn strolled over, clicking her tongue. "Brittle bones, aren’t you?" She crouched beside him, tilting her head. "Now. Tell me. What exactly did you plan to do with me?"

"I—I—" Lucien wheezed, clutching his ribs.

She’d beaten him before, but this? This was different.

"Who the hell are you?!" he spat.

No way she was just a perfumer. No way.

Evelyn’s grin widened. "Guess."
###Chapter 350

"You have no right to interrogate me. Speak! What do you want from me?"

Evelyn demanded, pressing her boot harder into Lucien's back.

"I—I—"

Lucien gasped, spitting out a mouthful of blood as he exhaled. He had nothing left to lose—no pride, no fear. So he confessed.

"Who sent you? Vanessa? Dominic? Or someone else?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, increasing the pressure on his spine.

If it were those two, she could handle them herself.

But if it were someone else… she needed to be cautious. Their motives were unknown.

"No one sent me!" Lucien coughed, his voice ragged. "I just wanted to ruin you! You’re nothing but a discarded toy of Dominic Reeves. Who do you think you are, refusing me? I’ll make sure you—"

Before he could finish, Evelyn lifted her foot and slammed it down again, forcing another choked gasp from him. "Pathetic."

He’s a disgrace to perfumers everywhere.

Disgust twisted in her gut as she kept him pinned, ensuring he couldn’t rise. A glance at her watch told her the police would arrive soon.

She had called them the moment she opened the door for Lucien.

Even without an exact address, she had given them enough to find her.

She couldn’t let filth like him walk free.

"You think just because you can fight, you’ll succeed in this industry?" Lucien wheezed, rolling onto his back, his face smeared with blood. "You’ll never make it here. Never. People like you—from your country—are at the bottom. You’ll always be beneath us."

"Beneath you?" Evelyn’s voice was ice.

Her gaze flickered from his bleeding face to the space between his legs.

Revulsion surged as she remembered his intentions. Without hesitation, she stomped down—hard.

"GAH!"

Lucien curled into himself, writhing, his hands clutching at the source of his agony.

"Disgusting," Evelyn spat, stepping back.

But then—her instincts screamed.

She twisted left just as a bullet whizzed past her ear.

"Move! Kill her! Don’t let her escape!"

The voice belonged to Viktor Petrov, roaring from the staircase. Gunfire erupted, bullets tearing through the air.

Evelyn barely dodged, diving behind an overturned table.

He recovered too fast.

Two years without proper combat training had dulled her reflexes. She was still shaking off the rust.

A mistake.

She should’ve been more thorough.

Another voice joined Viktor’s—Ivan Volkov, the one-eyed bastard she’d tied up earlier.

Only Dmitri, the driver, remained unconscious in the room.

"Come out, you bitch! I’ll put a bullet between your eyes!" Viktor screamed, firing wildly.

Lucien, still groaning on the floor, dragged himself behind a wooden plank, laughing weakly. "You’re finished, Evelyn!"

Evelyn, however, remained eerily calm.

She assessed the room through the gap between furniture.

Then she smiled.

"Actually… you’re the ones who won’t walk away."

Just as she prepared to strike—

BOOM.

A deafening explosion rocked the building.
###Chapter 351

A sharp cry tore through the air. "Ah!"

Viktor Petrov clutched his hand, blood seeping between his fingers.

Ivan Volkov, standing beside him, turned abruptly. His breath hitched.

A knife was embedded in Viktor's palm. The gun he had been holding clattered to the floor.

Ivan's face drained of color as he noticed the thin, bleeding gash on Viktor's ear—another knife had grazed him from behind. Just looking at the wound made Ivan's own skin prickle with phantom pain. He exhaled shakily, grateful he hadn’t been the target.

Viktor, teeth gritted, raised his uninjured hand toward Evelyn Carter.

But it was too late.

Both his hands were useless now.

"I'll end you!" he snarled, voice thick with rage.

Evelyn had disarmed him completely. The gun lay abandoned on the ground.

Viktor whipped his head toward Ivan, who stood frozen beside him. "Kill her!" he barked. "Do it now!"

"I—I can't—"

Ivan's mind reeled.

He had never seen a woman move like that—like a storm, ruthless and untouchable. Every instinct in him screamed to run.

"What the hell are you waiting for?!"

Then—

A deafening siren split the night.

Blue and red lights flashed through the windows, painting the walls in pulsing hues.

Viktor's eyes widened. "You called the cops?!"

"Move!"

All three of them were wanted men. If caught, they'd rot in prison for life.

Viktor and Ivan bolted for the exit.

But Evelyn didn’t follow.

Instead, she sprinted upstairs.

Lucien Dubois lunged for her—only to miss and crash into Viktor instead.

"Get off me!" Viktor roared, shoving him away.

He had no time for this. No time to wonder why Evelyn had run up instead of out.

But Lucien clung to him like a drowning man. "You're not leaving me behind!"

Panic edged his voice. If the police got him, it was over.

"Let go! There's no time!" Ivan snapped.

Outside, the yard blazed with floodlights.

A voice boomed through a megaphone: "This is the police! The house is surrounded! Release the hostage immediately!"

Viktor and Ivan exchanged a baffled glance.

Hostage?

Who the hell was the hostage here?

Upstairs, Dmitri Sokolov strained against the ropes binding him to the chair.

The chaos below was muffled, but he could hear enough—shouting, sirens, the sharp commands of law enforcement.

His jaw clenched.

He had hoped Viktor and Ivan would win. That they'd bring Evelyn to him, broken and begging.

But the police were here.

The lights grew brighter. The sirens louder.

His pulse spiked.

He needed to escape. Now.

Then—

The door burst open.

A shadow moved too fast for him to see.

The ropes around his wrists loosened.

Dmitri flexed his hands, stunned.

What—?

He turned his head.

Evelyn stood in the corner, watching him.

His mind scrambled.

Why is she unharmed? Did Viktor fail? Then why free me?

Before he could speak, the police's voices filtered up again.

He swallowed hard. "You—"

"Shut up."

Two words. That was all it took.

Dmitri's mouth snapped closed.

The look in her eyes promised worse than death if he tested her.
###Chapter 352

The chaos unfolding downstairs remained unknown to Dmitri, but his instincts screamed that this was his only chance to escape. If he hesitated now, he'd be trapped forever.

After a tense moment of deliberation, Dmitri pushed himself up and stumbled toward the window. His breath caught at the sea of flashing lights and armed officers below.

Why were there so many? But hesitation wasn't an option. He tightened his belt, scanning for a gap in the police perimeter.

Just as he prepared to jump, a voice like frozen steel sliced through the air. "Take one step, and I'll shatter both your knees."

Dmitri's legs buckled, sending him crashing against the windowsill. He knew that threat wasn't empty—this woman had already proven she'd follow through.

The contradiction gnawed at him. She'd knocked him unconscious, yet hadn't harmed him further or let him flee. What twisted game was she playing? "What do you want from me?" His voice cracked with barely restrained panic.

"Stop asking questions and keep your eyes on me!" Evelyn commanded, her gaze sharp enough to flay skin.

Dmitri swallowed hard. "Yes, ma'am." As his initial terror subsided, confusion took root. Why this bizarre order to stare at her?

The answer would soon become horrifyingly clear.

When the gunfire outside finally ceased, SWAT teams breached the property. Ivan made a desperate break for freedom, only to be instantly neutralized by a sniper's bullet.

Officers swarmed the ground floor, discovering Viktor Petrov clutching his bleeding arm beside a barely conscious accomplice. They secured both men before storming upstairs.

"Hostage located!" an officer radioed upon spotting Adrienne.

Alexander burst in behind them, then froze. "That's not her!"

While police combed the premises, Dmitri's anxiety spiked. Escape was impossible now—trapped between armed officers and this terrifying woman. Had fate ever dealt him a worse hand?

"Freeze!" Rifles snapped up in unison. "Hands where we can see them! Release the hostage!"

Dmitri complied instantly, relief washing over him. Prison would be paradise compared to whatever this witch had planned.

But how could he release a hostage...when he was the hostage?

"Ms. Carter?" An officer approached cautiously.

Evelyn lifted her tear-streaked face. "Y-Yes, that's me..."

Dmitri's jaw dropped. Those weren't tears—they were perfectly timed droplets she'd conjured from nowhere! The audacity!

"Don't be afraid, Ms. Carter. You're safe now. We're—"

A familiar figure shouldered through the crowd. "Evelyn!"

Her performance faltered for a heartbeat. "Alexander? What—" The genuine shock in her eyes confirmed this wasn't part of her scheme.

He crushed her against his chest before she could finish. "I've got you. You're safe now."

Both Dmitri and Evelyn stared, dumbstruck by this unexpected development.

Alexander shrugged off his coat, draping it around her shoulders with trembling hands. "Forgive me for not coming sooner. What you endured..." His voice broke as he traced a thumb under her fake tears, his own anguish raw and unfeigned.

The sight of her "distress" seemed to physically pain him. Dmitri couldn't contain his outburst. "Suffered? Her?" His incredulous laugh bordered on hysterical.
###Chapter 353

The kidnappers were the ones who had suffered, but no one in the room would believe him.

"Shut up and stay where you are!" Evelyn didn’t even have to react—one of the officers had already kicked him hard in the back. Dmitri wanted to scream. He had never felt so utterly humiliated in his life.

"Let’s go. This place gives me the creeps. I don’t want to stay another second." Evelyn tilted her head toward Alexander, her voice soft but firm.

"Of course. Let’s get out of here." He nodded. Alexander had managed to coordinate with the police after losing contact with Evelyn, immediately reaching out to the Laurentian authorities for help.

The moment Evelyn called for assistance, they had alerted him right away. Now that she was safe, the police only needed her to answer a few routine questions about the kidnapping before she could leave. But Alexander, worried she was exhausted, spoke to the captain and arranged for her to come in another day to complete the formalities.

Once everything was settled, he escorted Evelyn and her still-unconscious assistant out.

"Are you hurt?"

Though he had already asked once, they weren’t home yet, and he couldn’t properly check her over. The anxiety gnawed at him, so he asked again.

After running background checks on the criminals they’d apprehended, the police were stunned to discover the three men were internationally wanted fugitives. It was an unexpected windfall—capturing dangerous men who had evaded authorities for years.

But Alexander was sick with worry. These were ruthless criminals. He couldn’t imagine how terrified Evelyn must have been when they took her. The thought made him pull her closer, his grip tightening protectively.

"I’m fine. Just tired," she murmured, shaking her head and leaning into his embrace.

She had fought those men with everything she had. Every muscle in her body ached as if her bones might shatter. All she wanted was to collapse into bed and not move for hours. Still, she was touched that Alexander had flown all the way here. She knew he’d be worried when she disappeared, but she hadn’t expected him to cross an ocean and join the rescue mission himself.

It hit her then—just how much she meant to him. The lengths he would go to protect her. The realization warmed her in ways she couldn’t describe.

"Just rest," he murmured, not wanting to push her further. His gaze flickered to the unconscious woman in the backseat.

They had pulled her from that wooden shack and placed her in the car ages ago. How was she still out cold? His brow furrowed. "What’s wrong with her?"

Evelyn glanced at Adrienne, torn between exasperation and sympathy. She sighed. "They drugged her. That’s why she hasn’t woken up yet."

"Drugged?" Alexander had been so focused on Evelyn’s safety that he hadn’t stopped to consider the details of the abduction. Now, hearing about the drugs, his mind raced, piecing together how it must have happened.

"Yeah," Evelyn nodded. "They pretended to be Serena’s colleagues, said she needed to speak to me urgently. Adrienne insisted on coming—worried about me—and got taken too. I think it was in the car. They used some kind of drugged air freshener, so..."

"You weren’t affected?" His eyes widened.

Given Adrienne’s condition, the drug was clearly potent. She hadn’t even stirred during the chaos in the shack, and now, she showed no signs of waking.

"Well..." Evelyn hesitated. "I was, but... I work with fragrances all the time. Maybe my body built up a resistance. I woke up quickly, but Adrienne’s still out. We should get her checked—make sure there’s nothing serious."

Alexander nodded. That made sense. "We’ll have the doctor look at you too. Just to be safe."
###Chapter 354

"Alright..." Evelyn murmured. She was fine, completely fine. Vanessa, on the other hand, was restless. The theme for the finals weighed heavily on her mind.

Lucien hadn’t been able to give her any clues.

According to him, the finals' theme was personally decided by the judge—most likely Mr. Whitaker—and the organizers hadn’t disclosed who it was. Without that crucial piece of information, Lucien couldn’t leverage his connections to get an early advantage.

Without it, Vanessa had no confidence in winning.

Truthfully, she was like a student about to fail an exam without cheating. Soon, she’d be humiliated in front of the entire nation. She needed to find Lucien and discuss their next move. Even if she couldn’t win, she wouldn’t let Evelyn—that wretched woman—take the crown.

But no matter how many times she knocked on his door, no one answered.

She tried calling, but he didn’t pick up.

Unease settled in her chest, growing heavier with each passing minute. Her instincts screamed that something was wrong.

"Aside from minor cuts, she’s perfectly fine," the doctor assured Alexander as he removed his stethoscope.

"Are you certain?" Alexander remained skeptical. He wanted Evelyn to be unharmed, but he wouldn’t rest until she’d been thoroughly examined.

"Mr. Kensington, I assure you, I’ve conducted a full check-up. Everything is normal. If Mrs. Kensington still feels unwell, we could perform a CT scan or an MRI—"

"No, no, I’m fine, really!" Evelyn cut in quickly. "I feel completely normal."

The doctor gave Alexander a knowing look. Finally, he relented with a nod. "What about the other woman?"

"Yes, I examined her as well. The drug has nearly cleared from her system. She should regain consciousness soon. If you’re still concerned, we can run further tests once she wakes." The doctor hesitated, glancing at Evelyn. "Though… there’s something odd."

Alexander tensed. "What is it?"

"It’s nothing serious," the doctor said, shaking his head. "But both Mrs. Kensington and Ms. Laurent were drugged, correct? Strangely, I couldn’t detect any trace of the drug in Mrs. Kensington’s system."

Evelyn paused, then smiled. "Maybe my metabolism is just that good. Didn’t you say Adrienne’s system is nearly clear too? Mine might just be faster."

The doctor considered this before nodding. "It’s not impossible. Though, that would mean your metabolism is faster than even a grown man’s."

"I suppose. I wouldn’t know for sure," Evelyn replied with an innocent smile.

The doctor studied her for a moment before finally accepting the explanation and leaving without another word.

Alexander sat beside her, his gaze intense. "Are you really okay?"
###Chapter 355

"Honestly, I'm perfectly fine," Evelyn insisted with an exasperated sigh. "Would you like me to get up and do a twirl to prove it?"

She made to throw off the covers when Alexander's firm hand pressed her back against the mattress. His voice held a warning edge. "Don't test me, Evelyn."

The reprimand sounded more suited for a misbehaving child than his wife.

Evelyn gave a small nod. "There's really no need to worry. I'm completely unharmed, though you don't seem convinced."

"I was calm until you started downplaying everything," Alexander countered, his jaw tightening. "Now tell me - how exactly did you manage to provoke them?"

Evelyn bit her lip in thought. "I didn't recognize any of them at first. It wasn't until Lucien showed up that I realized this was all his doing."

"Lucien..." Alexander's brow furrowed. "That name rings a bell."

Though they'd never met, Evelyn had mentioned the French perfumer in passing before. Alexander had dismissed him as insignificant at the time, but hearing the name again stirred an uneasy familiarity.

"Vanessa and Dominic brought him in as a consultant once," Evelyn explained. "He wasn't officially with DR Holdings, so I never learned their exact connection. But one thing's certain - Lucien has some unhealthy obsession with me."

"Let me guess," Alexander's voice turned dangerously quiet. "This traces back to Dominic Reeves again?"

Evelyn saw the storm brewing in his eyes and reached up to cradle his face. Her thumbs brushed along his sharp cheekbones as she shook her head. "Not necessarily. This could be Vanessa's scheme, or purely Lucien's doing. He's...expressed inappropriate interest before."

Alexander's eyes darkened at her words. "What exactly do you mean by 'inappropriate interest'? And why am I only hearing about this now?"

"It wasn't worth mentioning," Evelyn said with a dismissive wave. "Lucien made an advance once and got thoroughly humiliated for it. I have no idea if today connects to that incident or the perfume competition finals."

She tilted her head thoughtfully. "Vanessa made it to finals too. For all we know, they could be lovers - I've heard rumors they're involved."

These were just theories, of course. The deranged Frenchman had been too busy screaming obscenities to provide any useful answers before the police arrived.

Evelyn almost laughed at the irony. In movies, cops always showed up after the drama concluded. Today, they'd been annoyingly punctual.

"Reasons don't matter," Alexander growled, his entire body radiating lethal energy. Like a predator scenting blood, every muscle coiled with restrained violence. "He won't live to see another sunrise."

Evelyn shivered - not from fear, but from the fierce protectiveness radiating from her husband. His rage was a tangible testament to how deeply he cared.

"The police already have Lucien," she reminded him, lacing their fingers together. "Kidnapping, conspiracy with international criminals, drug possession - he'll rot in prison. He's not worth your attention, Alex."

Alexander's elegant hands - with their deceptive delicacy masking raw power - had shaped empires. They shouldn't be sullied by trash like Lucien Dubois.

"Drugs?" Alexander's head snapped up, startled. "What about them?"

"What would you like to know?" Evelyn met his gaze steadily.
###Chapter 356

If Evelyn were to tell Alexander that Lucien had intended to inject her with drugs, she knew Alexander would lose control.

The consequences would be irreversible.

After a moment of consideration, Evelyn said, "I overheard the kidnappers discussing it when I regained consciousness. Oh, and they had a hideout where they kept me. The police must have seized it as evidence."

Alexander listened in silence.

Though he didn’t speak, his grip on her hand tightened gradually, betraying his unease.

Drugs at the hideout? What if she had accidentally come into contact with them? Worse—what if they had forced them on her? The thought alone made his blood run cold.

"Let’s go home," Alexander insisted, his voice firm.

He needed her back in their safe haven. The mere idea of what could have happened if the rescue had failed—if he hadn’t flown to her side—was unbearable.

Evelyn leaned against his shoulder but straightened abruptly at his words. "No! I still have the final round of the competition."

"You’re not going," Alexander stated flatly.

The competition, the prize—none of it mattered.

All he cared about was her safety.

"But—"

Evelyn bit her lip.

She understood his fear. He was only saying this because he loved her. With a soft sigh, she feigned resignation, lowering her lashes.

"Fine, I won’t participate. Even though I’ve prepared so much and was sure I could win… it doesn’t matter. Phoenix Labs and Adrienne will be disappointed, but that’s nothing compared to you."

She gave him a small, wistful smile. "No one would dare question your decision anyway. My colleagues might judge me, but who cares? I’ll just stay home, be a pampered wife—spa days, shopping, endless leisure. Sounds perfect, right?"

Despite her words, the reluctance in her expression was unmistakable.

Alexander saw right through her act.

He knew her ambitions, her passion. He had always supported her dreams—until now, when fear had nearly made him selfish.

His gaze lingered on her face. If he forced her to withdraw, the light in her eyes would dim.

With a defeated exhale, he relented. "Fine. You can go."

Evelyn’s eyes brightened instantly.

"But," he continued sternly, "you must prioritize your safety. Nothing—nothing—is more important than your life."

"I know. You’re the best."

She pressed a quick kiss to his cheek.

Alexander arched a brow. "That’s all?"

"Hmm?"

Before she could react, he cradled the back of her head and captured her lips in a deep, possessive kiss.

Her sweetness flooded his senses, the warmth of her against him the only thing that could soothe the lingering terror in his chest.

Even the slightest risk to her was unacceptable.

He pulled her closer, his arms locking around her as if he could shield her from the world.
###Chapter 357

Alexander had done everything possible to keep Evelyn's kidnapping under wraps.

While domestic media remained silent, whispers spread through Laurentia.

Industry insiders, particularly those who attended the perfume sampling conference, were already buzzing with the news.

Serena was beside herself with worry. She would have rushed to Evelyn's side immediately, but her father stopped her when she tried to leave so late at night.

Adrienne, however, was the most bewildered of them all. She had been kidnapped too—yet she had slept through the entire ordeal.

She only learned what happened after the doctors examined her.

Even after watching the news reports, she couldn’t wrap her head around it.

"Is this real?" she asked Evelyn repeatedly, her voice trembling. "Did we really get kidnapped?"

Her jaw dropped when Evelyn nodded.

"How is that possible? I don’t remember any of it!"

"You were drugged," Evelyn explained gently. "You were unconscious the whole time. It’s not surprising you don’t recall anything."

She hesitated, then added, "The dosage was strong."

Adrienne frowned. "You said we were exposed the moment we got into the car. Was it in the air freshener?"

Evelyn nodded again. "They only meant to take me. But since you insisted on coming along, they took you too. I’m sorry you got dragged into this."

Guilt weighed on her. Adrienne had suffered because of her.

"That’s not what matters," Adrienne said firmly. "What I don’t understand is—how are you okay?"

She wasn’t upset about being kidnapped.

What confused her was that she felt like she had simply taken a long nap—while Evelyn had clearly been awake through most of it.

"I—"

Alexander had asked her the same thing yesterday. Evelyn cleared her throat.

"You know I’m a perfumer. I’m sensitive to scents. I held my breath when I realized something was off."

She paused. "I still got affected, but my tolerance is higher. I’ve built up resistance to certain compounds. That’s why I woke up faster than you did."

She gave Adrienne a reassuring smile. "Don’t overthink it. What’s important is we’re both safe now."

Adrienne fell silent, her brow furrowed in thought.

Then she asked, "Why did they take you?"

Evelyn sighed. "Maybe to stop me from competing in the finals. Or for other reasons. I’m not sure. We’ll have to wait for the investigation."

Not wanting Adrienne to dwell on it, she quickly changed the subject.

"At least the police caught them. That’s something to be grateful for."

She forced a nervous laugh. "We still don’t know the theme for the final round. Aren’t you anxious?"

Adrienne’s expression shifted at the mention of the competition.

"Don’t be nervous," she said, patting Evelyn’s arm. "You’ve already proven yourself. The fact that someone tried to stop you just confirms how good you are."

She grinned. "Besides, making it this far is already a win. The company isn’t expecting perfection."

Then her smile faded slightly.

"Actually… if they wanted you out of the finals, it’s probably someone else in the competition. Or connected to a contestant."

She looked at Evelyn intently. "Did you tell the police to look into that?"
###Chapter 358

Evelyn turned her gaze toward the window, unable to bear continuing the conversation.

A short while later, they arrived at the venue where the final round of the competition would take place.

She wore a sleek, tailored suit—practical for movement, yet elegant enough to command respect.

Strangely, Evelyn no longer felt the usual nerves that came with high-stakes competitions.

Perhaps the unexpected kidnapping had shaken something loose inside her, replacing anxiety with a strange calm.

But now, her concern wasn’t the competition—it was the unsettling changes in her own body.

Lately, she had noticed something shifting within her, as if a dormant force had begun to stir.

It had grown more pronounced after the abduction, like a caged beast testing its bars.

She wondered—was it the stress of leaving Dominic and DR Holdings? Or had this always been there, buried deep?

Growing up under the influence of the Hawthorne family, she had learned basic combat skills.

She had never been considered extraordinary among them—just competent enough to hold her own.

Yet, against three internationally wanted criminals, she had moved with terrifying ease.

That shouldn’t have been possible.

The realization unsettled her, but there was no time to dwell on it now.

Thanks to the kidnapping, all eyes were on her the moment she stepped into the venue.

Adrienne, her assistant, couldn’t enter the competition hall and had to wait outside.

Evelyn straightened her posture, walking confidently to her seat before scanning the room.

Every participant here had earned their place in the finals.

Aside from Evelyn and Vanessa, none of the competitors were from Veridia.

There was a reason perfumers like Lucien Dubois dismissed Veridian talent.

Despite its size, Veridia had shockingly few renowned perfumers.

Those with real skill either emigrated or joined foreign research teams, draining the country of its brightest minds.

The thought made Evelyn’s chest tighten.

She wouldn’t call herself fiercely patriotic, but standing here, representing Veridia among strangers, something stirred in her.

She was here to prove them wrong.

Today, she would win.

Yet one person was conspicuously absent—Vanessa Blake.

Evelyn had expected another round of sharp words, another public humiliation.

Vanessa never missed a chance to tear her down.

But she wasn’t here.

Vanessa hadn’t simply skipped the competition—she hadn’t even made it out of her home.

Because at that very moment, the police were waiting at her doorstep.

She had been dressed to impress, ready to claim victory and glory.

But fate had other plans.
###Chapter 359

The sudden appearance of police officers sent Vanessa's heart racing.

She had heard about Evelyn's kidnapping, of course—who hadn't? But the authorities had been tight-lipped about the perpetrators.

After scouring every news outlet and article, all she learned was that three internationally wanted criminals had taken Evelyn.

The motive? Still a mystery.

Vanessa had been bitterly disappointed when Evelyn wasn't killed during the abduction.

Even if she survived, Vanessa had hoped the rescue would come too late—just enough to keep Evelyn from competing in the finals.

But luck had favored Evelyn. She was found unharmed.

The news had infuriated Vanessa.

And now, with Lucien Dubois suddenly unreachable, her unease grew. A gnawing suspicion told her he might have been involved.

Not that she cared.

Lately, she had realized Lucien was becoming less useful. The benefits he offered were dwindling.

She had once believed that aligning with him would fast-track her to international recognition, connecting her with elite perfumers.

But after arriving in Laurentia, she quickly saw the truth—Lucien's reputation here was in tatters. He struggled just to stay relevant.

No wonder he preyed on people in other countries.

With that realization, Vanessa knew he was no longer her golden ticket. It was time to cut ties and find a new patron.

Her sights were set on Harrison Whitaker.

He was older, yes, but he had the prestige and influence she craved.

A true master perfumer.

If she could secure his favor, her future would be limitless.

So she had spent extra time perfecting her appearance before leaving for the competition, hoping to catch Harrison's eye.

If she succeeded, losing the competition wouldn’t matter. She’d still come out on top.

But now, the police stood in her way.

"Are you Ms. Vanessa Blake?"

One officer flashed his badge.

"You’re a suspect in a kidnapping case. You’ll need to come with us for questioning. You have the right to remain silent, but anything you say can be used against you in court."

Vanessa’s mind went blank.

"No! I have a competition to attend! This is crucial for me! You must be mistaken—I’ve been in my hotel this whole time! How could I be involved in a kidnapping? Who even—Evelyn? Did she accuse me?"

She took frantic steps back, words tumbling out.

"Listen, she hates me! She’s framing me! I didn’t do anything! Please, just let me go—I need to compete! You can question me after, I swear!"

The mention of kidnapping could only mean Evelyn’s case.

But why were they coming for her?

Sure, she had dropped hints to Lucien, maybe even planted ideas—but she hadn’t orchestrated anything concrete.

This wasn’t her doing!

"Sorry, but you’re coming with us now."

Handcuffs snapped around her wrists. Her protests fell on deaf ears.

"No! No—!"
###Chapter 360

Vanessa wanted to protest but knew better than to defy their orders.

Within minutes, she found herself escorted to the police station just as the final round of the competition was about to commence.

N?velDrama.Org held all rights to the event.

The decisive moment had arrived, yet the nature of the challenge remained shrouded in mystery.

Instead of an immediate announcement, a procession of attendants entered the grand hall, each bearing silver trays with practiced smiles.

Every contestant exchanged confused glances at this unexpected development.

The attendants placed the trays before each participant before lifting the lids in perfect synchronization.

Two identical-looking perfume bottles rested on each tray, distinguishable only by their labels.

The head judge cleared his throat.

"Absolute silence, please." His voice carried across the room. "First, congratulations on reaching this final stage. Your presence here confirms you're among perfumery's elite. But the road to becoming Laurentia's master perfumers remains long. Today's challenge will separate the exceptional from the merely excellent."

He paused for effect before continuing. "Before you lie two fragrances. One crafted by Mr. Whitaker himself, the other by a mid-tier perfumer. Your task is to analyze both, identify their components, and evaluate their comparative strengths and weaknesses."

"Document your findings using the provided materials. The contestant with the most accurate analysis wins. In case of ties, the faster completion time will determine victory."

A silver stopwatch appeared in his hand.

"Begin!"

Nearly every participant reached for the bottles simultaneously, yet none rushed to open them.

Professionalism prevailed.

They began by visually examining the vessels, attempting preliminary scent detection through the glass before cautiously removing the caps to allow gradual olfactory assessment.

Finally, they applied droplets to their wrists to discern the base notes.

All followed this methodical approach—except Evelyn.

Her fingers first traced the embossed labels, her sharp eyes noting the identical markings on every tray.

Both perfumes bore clear attribution: one to Harrison Whitaker, the other to the anonymous mid-tier perfumer.

This transparency struck her as unusual.

Standard practice dictated obscuring such information to prevent bias—novice perfumers often idolized masters like Whitaker, while others harbored competitive resentment toward established names.

Yet here, the organizers had deliberately revealed both creators' identities.

Evelyn's gaze lifted to the head judge, who monitored the room with an inscrutable expression that promised impartiality.

Her attention then drifted to Vanessa's conspicuously empty seat.

The absence confirmed her rival wouldn't be participating.

Returning to the task, Evelyn brought one bottle to her nose.

A delicate floral bouquet greeted her senses.
###Chapter 361

The evaluation didn't drag on.

Within the first thirty minutes, participants began submitting their answer sheets.

The venue slowly emptied, but Evelyn Carter remained at her station, carefully composing her responses.

Identifying the ingredients was effortless—she could have listed them in seconds.

What intrigued her was how nearly identical the two fragrances were. Not just in hue, but in their layered notes as well.

Their strengths and flaws mirrored each other so closely it gave her pause.

Around her, competitors shifted nervously as others finished quickly. After brief hesitation, they too completed their papers.

Only a handful remained when the examiner announced, "Ten minutes remaining. Unsubmitted answers will be disqualified."

The stragglers hurried to finish.

Evelyn inhaled the scent one last time. A knowing smile curved her lips as she finalized her notes and turned them in.

Exiting the hall, she found the early finishers gathered in a waiting area.

Organizers had instructed everyone to remain for immediate results.

With the test concluded, the atmosphere grew lively. Days of competition had forged familiarity among participants, and cheerful chatter filled the room.

"Mr. Whitaker's formulation was masterful," one woman gushed. "That complexity is beyond most perfumers. It's groundbreaking—this will dominate the international market this year!"

Several nodded agreement, but a scoff cut through the admiration. "Please. You actually believe Harrison Whitaker created that? Bottle labels can lie. This is clearly a test to spot the bootlickers."

The critic, a sharp-featured man, smirked at the woman. "If you couldn't detect the inconsistencies, maybe stick to baking. Perfumery requires actual skill."

Her cheeks flushed crimson. "I identified every floral variant and specially treated essential oil in that composition. Question my expertise again, and remember—your mother was a woman too."

The debate escalated into personal jabs, splitting the group into factions.

One side staunchly defended Mr. Whitaker's unparalleled artistry.

The other insisted the organizers had planted his name to mislead and test their discernment.

As voices rose toward confrontation, Evelyn retreated to a quiet corner.

"You don't share either perspective?"

The low voice startled her. Turning, she found a man studying her with unusual intensity. His striking features—high cheekbones, a blade-straight nose—marked him as distinct from the crowd.

Having paid little attention to fellow competitors, Evelyn had no recollection of him. Yet his presence here confirmed his status.

Like her, he seemed detached from the brewing conflict.

"I didn't voice an opinion," she deflected.

His gaze sharpened. "Your expression did. You think they're both wrong."

Evelyn's fingers brushed her own cheek. "You can read that?"
###Chapter 362

The sunlight streaming through the windows cast long shadows across the room, but it was his gaze that caught her attention.

"It's not etched on your face," he remarked, his voice smooth as silk. "But in your eyes. They hold a depth of wisdom."

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard.

The man switched effortlessly to English, his fluency impeccable.

"You're quite eloquent," she replied, sidestepping his observation.

A pleased smile curved his lips. "Thank you."

He seized the opportunity to introduce himself, extending a hand. "Julian Mercer. A pleasure."

Evelyn rose from her seat, ignoring his outstretched hand. "It's time to go back."

The organizers had reappeared, ushering them toward the main hall. The chatter died down, replaced by an uneasy silence that settled over the room like a heavy blanket.

When she returned to her seat, she noticed Julian sitting a few rows behind her, his eyes already fixed on her.

No wonder she hadn’t recognized him earlier.

Catching her glance, he grinned and gave a small wave.

Evelyn offered a curt nod before turning away, her expression unreadable.

Why is he so fixated on a stranger?

The examiner cleared his throat, drawing everyone’s attention.

"Your answer sheets have been reviewed. After careful consideration, we’ve decided to announce the final results now." He paused, then added, "But before that, Mr. Whitaker has a few words for you."

Polite applause filled the room as Harrison Whitaker stepped forward.

Impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, his presence commanded respect. His sharp eyes swept over the crowd, lingering—just for a fraction of a second—on Evelyn.

Her pulse quickened.

Was that because of Serena?

Harrison Whitaker wasn’t known for favoring connections. If anything, he despised nepotism.

"I’m pleased to see such talent gathered here today," he began, his voice firm. "You represent the finest minds of the past two years."

A murmur of pride rippled through the audience.

Then his expression darkened.

"But I’m also disappointed."

The room stilled.

Confusion flickered across faces.

No one understood what he meant.

Before anyone could react, he continued, his tone cutting. "What happened to professionalism?"

Silence.

Then, from the back, a voice challenged him. "Mr. Whitaker, if we’ve done something wrong, tell us. Who offended you?"

Another participant chimed in, defensive. "The test was designed to mislead. Neither option was your actual work, was it?"

Evelyn suppressed a smirk.

This was about to get interesting.
###Chapter 363

The air in the room grew thick with tension as Harrison Whitaker responded without so much as glancing at the man who had spoken.

"What do you think?"

The man faltered, his confidence wavering.

What kind of answer was that? He had already voiced his opinion—wasn’t that what Harrison had asked for?

"Are you certain of your conclusion? Or is it merely an assumption?"

Harrison’s words left the room in a state of bewilderment. Murmurs spread as people exchanged confused glances.

"Judging by the answer sheets, quite a few of you shared the same opinion, didn’t you?" he pressed.

Silence.

The earlier heated arguments had already made it clear—there was no need to revisit the answer sheets.

Disagreement ran deep.

"And what about the rest of you?"

After one final round of questioning, Harrison straightened. "Let’s announce the results."

The examiner beside him gave a respectful nod before stepping forward. Ten names would be called.

Starting from tenth place.

Evelyn Carter’s breath hitched when Julian Mercer was announced as the second-place winner. She turned, meeting his gaze.

Julian was already looking at her. A faint, knowing smile curved his lips, his expression radiating quiet confidence.

As the ninth through second-place winners were named, the tension in the room became palpable. Only one spot remained—first place.

Success or failure hinged on this moment.

Then—

"Evelyn Carter."

A ripple of shock tore through the crowd.

"Her?! That’s impossible!"

Whispers erupted like wildfire.

Disbelief. Outrage. Skepticism.

Voices overlapped, hushed but sharp.

"The competition has been running for years—there’s never been anything this suspicious!"

"Didn’t she befriend Harrison’s daughter? This reeks of favoritism."

"Was she given the answers beforehand?"

"Why even hold a competition if the outcome is rigged?"

Nearly every face in the room twisted in resentment. None of them believed Evelyn deserved this.

None of them could accept that she—her—had bested them.

Then, a hand shot up.

"I challenge these results!"

Even with Harrison present, even knowing the decision was final, the man couldn’t contain his fury.

His finger jabbed toward Evelyn.

"Explain how she could possibly take first place. What makes her better than us? If this is fair, then prove it—otherwise, this competition is a sham!"
###Chapter 364

The murmurs of doubt filled the room, but Evelyn Carter remained unshaken. Her expression stayed cool and detached, as if the heated discussions around her had nothing to do with her.

The head judge glanced at Mr. Whitaker before raising a hand for silence. "You all wanted to know why Ms. Carter secured first place, didn’t you? The answer lies in the final question itself. Regarding the last challenge—do you truly believe your responses were correct?"

A sudden realization dawned on one of the contestants. "Wait… does that mean both bottles were Mr. Whitaker’s creations?"

If Mr. Whitaker hadn’t contradicted the earlier assumption, then the initial conclusion was flawed.

Since it was never explicitly stated that neither bottle belonged to him, the implication was clear—they did.

The judge smiled faintly, lifting a stack of completed answer sheets. "Here are your responses. Most of you meticulously analyzed the raw materials and composition, then concluded with your own judgments."

He paused. "Many of you claimed the two bottles weren’t Mr. Whitaker’s work, while others insisted they were. However, Ms. Carter’s answer didn’t include any such assertion."

Confused glances were exchanged.

"So analyzing it was wrong? Just because we added our own interpretation, whether right or wrong, we lost points?"

The judge stepped aside, gesturing for Evelyn to take the podium. "Perhaps Ms. Carter should explain herself. By the way, her positional analysis was the most precise."

Evelyn suppressed a sigh. She had assumed the competition would end after the results were announced, allowing her to leave. Instead, she was being dragged into this unnecessary spectacle.

Reluctantly, she approached the microphone.

Instead of immediately addressing the crowd, she turned to Mr. Whitaker, who sat observing quietly. "Before I answer, I’d like to ask Mr. Whitaker a question."

The room fell silent.

Mr. Whitaker arched a brow but nodded for her to proceed.

"What was the purpose behind the final question in this competition?"

Gasps rippled through the audience. How bold of her to question the legendary perfumer so directly!

Mr. Whitaker studied her for a long moment before replying, "What do you think?"

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "I believe you were testing whether external influences would cloud our judgment." She folded her arms. "The last question didn’t need labels at all. We were simply meant to analyze and evaluate. Whose work it was shouldn’t have mattered. But by deliberately labeling those bottles, you introduced bias—forcing us to second-guess, to overanalyze, to attach meaning where there was none."

One of the contestants scoffed. "That’s exactly why we questioned it! We refused to take the labels at face value and judged for ourselves!"

Evelyn shook her head. "No, you didn’t."

Her blunt rebuttal made the man stiffen.

She swept her gaze across the room. "You claimed to doubt the labels, but in reality, you became obsessed with them. You wasted time debating their authenticity, letting them distort your perception. Instead of focusing on the scents themselves, you got lost in speculation. That’s why your answers were flawed."

Silence settled over the room.

Despite their initial resistance, her words resonated.

Finally, someone spoke up. "Ms. Carter, then how did you answer? Didn’t you wonder about the creator at all?"
###Chapter 365

Evelyn studied the man before her, her response measured. "The creator's identity holds little significance here. This evaluation focuses solely on analyzing the composition's strengths and weaknesses—not its authorship."

"Then, if we strip away all labels and examine both works independently," the woman countered, "would your assessment remain unchanged?"

The question rippled through the audience, stirring contemplation. Without the weight of names attached, opinions might indeed shift.

As they pondered, doubts surfaced. Was this truly Harrison Whitaker's creation, or merely another challenge designed to test them?

After investing so much effort, no one had anticipated that fixating on authorship would distract from the competition's true purpose.

Now, her reasoning had swayed most.

Yet dissent lingered.

"Pardon me, Ms. Carter," a voice laced with skepticism cut in. "Your insights are impressive—especially for someone so young. Are you truly this brilliant, or have you simply had... prior exposure to such matters?"

The barb was thinly veiled. A seemingly innocent inquiry, but its implication was clear: she had an unfair advantage.

Evelyn met his gaze, unflinching. "That's not just presumptuous—it's ignorant."

Her tone remained composed, but her words struck like a whip. "Knowledge isn't bound by age. Some minds flourish early; others stagnate for decades. I’m not referring to you, of course. But if you're here, competence should be a given."

The room tensed. Her retort was polished yet cutting, leaving him flushed and speechless. To press further would only expose his own inadequacy—and risk disrespecting not just her, but Harrison Whitaker and the entire competition.

"The event has concluded successfully," the announcer declared, breaking the silence. "We’ve witnessed extraordinary talent in perfumery today. Each of you has the potential to carve your own legacy. Prizes and trophies will be distributed shortly."

Relief washed over Evelyn. She had no intention of participating in such events again. Research was her sanctuary.

Social maneuvering? A headache in disguise.

"Ms. Carter!"

Before she could leave, an attendant intercepted her. "Mr. Whitaker requests your presence. Please follow me."

Evelyn hesitated but complied. Security had tightened since the kidnapping; she wasn’t walking into another trap.

Inside the office, Harrison Whitaker sat waiting. He gestured for her to take a seat, his expression unreadable.

"Ms. Carter," he began, leaning forward slightly. "You’ve left quite an impression."

His tone carried neither warmth nor admiration—just stark acknowledgment.
###Chapter 366

"Thank you," Evelyn responded with practiced grace.

"However, I must challenge some of your earlier statements."

Shifting gears, Harrison continued, "When you claimed brand recognition doesn't influence you, was that genuine conviction or merely rhetoric because you couldn't discern the difference?"

He didn't pause for her reply before adding, "Regardless, your test results were objectively more precise than the others. Your first-place standing remains undisputed."

This was the real reason he'd detained her - the question burning in his mind that he couldn't voice publicly.

"Honestly, we're viewing this from opposite sides. I fundamentally disagree with your premise. The question itself contains inherent contradictions."

Evelyn remained composed as she articulated her perspective.

"Oh?"

Harrison's eyebrow arched, his expression turning mildly affronted.

Clearly, he dismissed her argument as defensive posturing to mask her supposed error.

Truthfully, Harrison had been dissatisfied with the competition's outcome. He'd intended to crown one of his protégés, but their performances fell short of expectations.

Though Evelyn secured top honors, his deep-seated bias prevented him from acknowledging her potential in their field.

"Wasn't your intention to redirect focus onto the fragrance itself, stripping away brand associations and external influences?" she countered.

Harrison hesitated momentarily before giving a slight nod. He couldn't refute that this had indeed been his objective.

A true perfumer should prioritize the essence of the scent above all else.

Yet consumers obsess over labels.

A fragrance bearing a prestigious name commands exorbitant prices and instant acclaim, while innovators struggle for recognition.

Harrison believed this paradigm needed shifting - that creations should stand on their own merit.

"Yet you deliberately marked the sample with your name while instructing us to disregard the perfumer's identity. Isn't that inherently contradictory? You're leveraging your reputation to influence perception while admonishing us against brand bias."

To her surprise, Harrison shook his head.

"You wouldn't have noticed this discrepancy if truly focused solely on the scent's quality. Yet you did."

Though reluctant to admit it, the observation held truth.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "That's not quite accurate. I'm suggesting the creator shouldn't overshadow the creation, not that we should ignore the perfumer entirely. The art and artist are inextricably linked. While we craft diverse fragrances, each bearing unique characteristics, it's the perfumer's distinctive touch that breathes life into them."

Initially poised to rebut, Harrison found himself gradually straightening his posture as she spoke. His subtle nod signaled shifting perceptions.

Studying Evelyn with newfound interest, he remarked, "You articulate your position remarkably well. Care to venture a guess at this perfume's creator?"
###Chapter 367

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile.

"Honestly, I don't even need to guess. The personal signatures in these two fragrances are unmistakable. Both carry that distinctive orchid note - rich, intoxicating, impossible to ignore."

Her gaze locked onto Harrison Whitaker with sudden intensity.

"It's nearly identical to your signature scent."

Harrison remained stone-faced. "And your conclusion?"

"You created both these perfumes. They're your creations," Evelyn stated without hesitation.

His eyebrow arched. "Are you absolutely certain? Many contestants gave that exact answer. Yet your written analysis noted significant differences between the two scents."

"Completely sure."

Evelyn leaned forward. "While the top notes differ dramatically, I noted something crucial in my answer - their base notes are identical. The divergence likely stems from one being an early work, the other a recent reformulation."

She continued passionately. "As perfumers, we don't just create new scents. We revisit, refine, perfect. Our perspectives evolve with experience. What seemed flawless years ago might reveal new possibilities today."

For the first time, Harrison's expression shifted.

"You've studied my portfolio."

"Of course. You're a legend in our field. Studying masters like you is how we grow."

"Then tell me," his voice warmed with genuine curiosity, "which of my creations do you admire most? And which would you rather forget?"

The conversation flowed effortlessly after that. Hours melted away unnoticed until an abrupt knock interrupted them.

"Mr. Whitaker?"

Harrison frowned at the intrusion. "Yes?"

A nervous assistant peered in. "Ms. Carter's ride has arrived."

Harrison checked his watch, startled. The entire afternoon had vanished. It had been years since he'd enjoyed such stimulating dialogue.

All his initial skepticism about Evelyn had evaporated. He regarded her with newfound respect.

"Evelyn," he said, dropping formalities entirely. "Your understanding of fragrance is exceptional. I'd be honored if you'd join my research team in Valmont."

Evelyn's breath caught. This was the ultimate validation for any perfumer - an invitation from the legendary Harrison Whitaker himself.

Yet hesitation flickered across her features.

After Dominic Reeves had stolen her previous creations, she'd vowed to establish her own signature line. This opportunity, while prestigious, might delay those plans.

"Your offer means more than I can express," she said carefully. "But my path lies with Celestia Group in Veridia. There's still much I need to accomplish there."

Harrison's eyes widened. No one had ever refused him before.

"Valmont is the world's perfume capital," he pressed. "Veridia hasn't produced a master perfumer in decades. You're squandering your gift there."

The regret in his voice was palpable.
###Chapter 368

Evelyn's expression darkened at his words. She couldn't agree with his assessment.

"You're mistaken," she countered firmly. "It's not that Veridia lacks exceptional perfumers. The truth is, other nations have poached them away."

She squared her shoulders. "I'm living proof. Right now, I could choose to leave or stay. That's exactly why I want to remain and build my career here—to prove that Veridia can cultivate world-class perfumers whose creations will dominate the global market."

Harrison exhaled heavily.

"Very well, I respect your choice. But if you ever reconsider, my offer stands."

"Thank you."

He chuckled. "Now I understand why Serena adores you so much."

Evelyn smirked. "Maybe it's because I don't sugarcoat the truth."

With a booming laugh, Harrison escorted her out, his smile unwavering.

When Evelyn spotted the sleek black sedan idling at the curb, she immediately knew.

Alexander.

After exchanging final pleasantries with Harrison, she slid into the car and confirmed her suspicion.

But Adrienne was nowhere in sight.

"Where's Adrienne?" Evelyn asked, brows knitting together.

"I reassigned her."

"Just like that?"

Evelyn couldn't hide her disbelief.

Adrienne was fiercely loyal—stubborn to a fault, especially after the kidnapping. There was no way she'd leave without a fight.

"I am her employer," Alexander drawled, his tone laced with arrogant amusement. The air around him practically crackled with authority.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Nice try. She might be cautious, but she's no pushover. Don't tell me you strong-armed her."

A smirk tugged at Alexander's lips. "Gregory redirected her to handle urgent matters at The Chateau Royale. I simply... expedited the process."

Evelyn groaned. Power abuse.

"And she bought that?"

"You know Adrienne. She follows orders, but she’s thorough. She only left after verifying this was a company vehicle." He gestured to the plush interior.

Evelyn checked her silenced phone. Sure enough, Adrienne had bombarded her with messages:

Confirm the driver's ID. Call headquarters to verify. Wait in the lobby until security clears the vehicle.

Warmth bloomed in Evelyn's chest.

She was lucky to be surrounded by people who cared so deeply.
###Chapter 369

"You took your time in there," Alexander remarked, leaning against the car.

Evelyn had lingered far longer than expected. By the time she emerged, the other contestants had already dispersed.

She gave a small nod.

"Mr. Whitaker wanted to talk. It took a while."

"What about?"

Evelyn hesitated, recalling Harrison’s words. A flicker of emotion crossed her face. "He invited me to join his team."

Alexander arched a brow, lips curving. "That’s high praise. You should be flattered."

"I turned him down."

Evelyn turned her gaze to the window, watching the city lights blur past.

Laurentia at night was breathtaking. The streets glittered like scattered gemstones, alive with the pulse of romance and artistry. It was the heart of perfumery, the birthplace of legendary fragrances.

And she had just walked away from a golden opportunity.

"You refused?" Alexander’s voice held genuine surprise. "Why?"

He tilted his head, a teasing glint in his eyes. "Afraid you’d miss me too much?"

Evelyn shot him a look. So full of himself.

"I want to build my own legacy," she said firmly. "A brand that earns its place in the Perfumer’s Hall of Honor."

Her eyes burned with determination, brighter than the stars above.

Alexander studied her face, struck by her beauty—not just in features, but in spirit. It was her fire, her unshakable will, that had drawn him in from the start. Even when life had knocked her down, she rose, relentless and radiant.

"I believe in you," he murmured, pulling her close. "You’ll make it happen."

Evelyn melted into his embrace, warmth spreading through her. There was no greater comfort than his arms around her, his faith unwavering.

Then—

"Wait!"

She jerked upright, fixing him with a sharp look.

"Something strange happened today. Vanessa never showed up."

Alexander shrugged. "Maybe she realized she couldn’t win and quit. Not everyone makes it to the end."

Evelyn shook her head. "No. That’s not her. She fought tooth and nail to get here. She wouldn’t just walk away." A frown creased her brow. "Unless something happened. Do you think she was—"

Kidnapped?

The odds were slim, but…

Her gaze narrowed. "Did you…?"

They’d discussed Vanessa before. Evelyn suspected her of orchestrating past troubles, though proof was scarce.

Given Alexander’s temper—and what she’d told him—she wouldn’t put it past him to retaliate.

Alexander raised his hands in mock surrender. "I didn’t lay a finger on her. She’s not worth the effort."

His expression was unreadable, but his words rang true.

Vanessa meant nothing to him. He wouldn’t waste his time.

Evelyn exhaled, still puzzled. "Then where is she?"

After the competition, Adrienne had left for urgent business back at Celestia Group, leaving Evelyn and Alexander free to enjoy Laurentia—just the two of them.
###Chapter 370

"Where exactly are we going?" Evelyn asked, curiosity lacing her voice as the wind tousled her hair.

The others had departed, leaving just the two of them alone.

"I promised you a trip as a reward, but the competition got in the way." Dominic flashed her a roguish grin. "Consider this my way of making it up to you."

She hadn’t noticed when he’d procured the sleek convertible, but now they were speeding down the open highway, the scenery blurring past like something out of a romance film.

"Wait—I was supposed to meet Sophia and Victoria today!" She groaned, suddenly remembering the plans she’d canceled last-minute.

Dominic shot her a sideways glance, his expression turning petulant. "Am I not better company?"

Even while driving, he couldn’t resist pouting. The man had a talent for jealousy, no matter the situation.

"Fine, you win," she conceded, reaching over to turn his face back toward the road. "Now focus on driving."

Safety first, especially when he was behind the wheel. His lips curled into a smug smile at her praise, and he squeezed her hand reassuringly. "Come with me this time. You can see them next week."

She sighed. "I can’t just take off whenever I want. Unlike some people, I don’t own the company."

Dominic arched a brow. "Did you forget who you’re dating?"

Evelyn fell silent. Over the past few days, he’d been calling Gregory directly, bypassing her entirely. Every instruction he gave was relayed straight to her.

At this point, only an idiot wouldn’t have figured out their relationship.

"Did you tell Gregory about us?" she asked, nerves tightening her voice.

"No," he said smoothly, though his fingers laced through hers. "But he’s not blind. He knows you’re with me, and there’s nothing wrong with that. If you need anything, just let him know."

She pressed her lips together, saying nothing.

"I know you want to prove yourself," he continued, his tone softening. "But leaning on me doesn’t make you weak. Take this competition—even if the company recommended you because of me, you still had to earn that win. I didn’t rig it for you."

Bringing her hand to his lips, he pressed a kiss to her knuckles.

Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh at his serious expression. "I wasn’t accusing you."

"Good," he murmured, slowing the car as he turned to face her fully. "Because we can’t hide forever. So… when do you want to make us official?"

Her breath caught.

The way he looked at her—half teasing, half earnest—sent her pulse racing.

With his status, he could’ve announced their relationship without consulting her. But he’d kept his word, respecting her wishes every step of the way.

A slow smile curved her lips. She tangled her fingers with his and whispered, "Soon."

Soon.

When she was stronger, when she could stand beside him without doubt—then she’d claim him before the world.

And no one would question that he was hers.
###Chapter 371

The scenery along the extended road gradually captivated Evelyn.

Endless fields of lavender stretched out on either side, their purple hues fading as the season drew to a close. Most of the flowers had already been harvested, leaving only scattered patches still being gathered by workers.

The air carried a delicate floral fragrance, crisp and soothing.

"Lavendelle," she murmured, tilting her head back to let the breeze, laced with the scent of blossoms, caress her face. Nature's beauty embraced her fully.

"Admittedly, this isn't the best time for flower viewing," Dominic remarked as he drove. "But there's more to see here than just lavender. I think you'll find it intriguing."

Evelyn glanced at him with a knowing smile. "Lavendelle is famous for its lavender. Every June, the harvest begins—distilled into essential oils, perfumes, soaps, and more. That's what you wanted to show me, isn't it?"

"You've figured it all out. Where's the fun in that?"

His lips curved into an amused grin as he focused on the road, accelerating slightly. He had successfully piqued her curiosity, creating an atmosphere where she could relax, her tension melting away.

She let him lead without further questions.

After winding through vast lavender fields and narrow paths, they arrived at a lively town.

Modern high-rises stood alongside medieval architecture, blending past and present seamlessly. The streets bustled with people—some hurrying through markets, others strolling leisurely. The mingling crowd painted a vibrant scene.

The lingering scent of lavender in the air was calming, almost therapeutic.

Once he parked, Dominic took her hand, guiding her down a charming, cobbled street. No bodyguards trailed them, no need to hide. Here, they were just an ordinary couple, anonymous and free.

Evelyn loved this feeling—unburdened, carefree.

"You drove all this way just to skip going home and go shopping instead?" she teased, laughing.

Not that she minded.

"Of course not."

Before she could respond, he tugged her around a corner and into a quaint shop.

The exterior was unassuming, but inside, it was a treasure trove of exquisite items.

Most of the accessories and decor were crafted in varying shades of brown and green, creating a warm, cohesive aesthetic. The atmosphere was inviting, the style distinctly unique.

"This place is enchanting!" She turned to Dominic, her eyes alight with curiosity.

"Can you tell what makes it special?" he asked, amused.

The shop was quiet, with only a handful of customers murmuring softly, their occasional laughter light and airy.

Evelyn wandered leisurely until she spotted a delicate carving on a shelf—a heart, not red, but a soft, earthy brown.

The craftsmanship was intricate yet simple.

Leaning closer, she inhaled deeply. A faint, sweet aroma mingled with something richer, almost edible.

Intrigued, she reached out—

"Hello, please don't touch that!"

The sharp voice spoke in Laurentian.

Evelyn withdrew her hand immediately. "My apologies. I just thought it was beautiful."

If touching wasn't allowed, then she wouldn't.
###Chapter 372

The proximity between them, combined with her natural fragrance, gave Evelyn an overwhelming sense of confidence.

"You speak Laurentian?" Alexander Kensington's eyes widened in surprise. This was news to him.

"Just a little," she replied with a soft smile.

To her, it wasn’t something worth making a fuss about.

What truly captivated her was the store they were standing in.

"It’s mesmerizing here."

Alexander didn’t press further—her reluctance to elaborate was obvious.

Instead, he shifted the conversation back to their surroundings. "Then take a guess. What’s this made of?"

The clerk beside them opened his mouth to answer, but Alexander silenced him with a subtle glance.

Amused by his smug expression—as if he was certain she wouldn’t know—Evelyn tilted her head. "Olivella Soap. Did you think I wouldn’t get it right?"

Alexander fell silent.

The smirk on his face froze momentarily. Clearly, he hadn’t expected her to answer correctly on the first try. "You’ve seen this before?"

"Not exactly. But I guessed based on the places you’ve taken me. Lavendelle is famous for its lavender, and this region has built an entire industry around it. Olivella Soap is quite unique." She paused, then continued, "It’s primarily made from olive oil, which gives it this distinct color. And the scent? Unlike any other soap."

"So, you already knew," he murmured after a long pause.

There was a hint of playful frustration in his tone, as if he had prepared this moment to surprise her, only for her to ruin it effortlessly. It was the first time Evelyn had seen him look so… mildly defeated.

It was both amusing and endearing.

Deep down, he really was sweet.

"I only knew in theory. I’ve never actually seen it before," she admitted, looping her arm through his and leaning against him. "I read about Olivella Soap while researching Lavendelle, so it wasn’t hard to guess. But this?" She gestured around. "This craftsmanship is incredible. I’ve never seen soap carved into such intricate designs!"

She wasn’t just saying it to make him feel better. The artistry here was breathtaking.

Every ornament and pendant was meticulously carved from Olivella Soap—delicate pens, lifelike animal figurines, even a tiny bear with eyes so vivid she was instantly drawn to it.

But there was a catch.

Touching them would ruin their pristine appearance. The warmth of human hands could slightly melt the soap, altering its shape.

Small signs in multiple languages discreetly warned: Do not touch.

Evelyn had been too excited earlier to notice.

"Olivella Soap isn’t common in this area, but this shop is special. Everything here is handmade," Alexander explained, casually picking up a small soap sculpture.

"Wait—!"

Before the clerk could intervene, Alexander already had it in his palm. Evelyn quickly turned to the clerk. "We’ll take it."

Then she shot Alexander a disapproving look. "They literally said not to touch!"

Alexander merely grinned. "Didn’t you just say we’re buying it?"

"Fine…"

"Mr. Kensington! I’ve been waiting for you!"

A man burst into the shop, heading straight for Alexander with an enthusiastic hand outstretched.
###Chapter 373

"Mr. Blackwood, it's an honor to meet you."

Dominic shook hands with him, though the other man's enthusiasm far surpassed his own.

Evelyn observed Donovan Blackwood's warm demeanor and effortless charm.

Had this meeting been prearranged?

"What do you think? I wasn't exaggerating, was I? Let me be frank—in this industry, I wouldn't dare claim Olivella Soap is the absolute best, but it is undoubtedly the most innovative."

He gestured toward the meticulously arranged shelves.

"These aren't just cleansing bars—they're functional art. Over 85% of our Olivella Soap is plant-based. The skincare benefits speak for themselves, but beyond that, they make exquisite gifts. Customizable, versatile, and beautifully packaged."

Donovan's presence commanded immediate respect from the staff, their postures straightening as soon as he entered.

Assuming this was strictly business, Evelyn stayed silent, quietly admiring the intricate carvings. Even if the owner boasted, the craftsmanship justified his pride.

She had seen decorative candles, wood carvings, even stone sculptures—but soap as an art form was entirely new to her.

"What's your take?"

The question caught her off guard. She hadn't expected Dominic to seek her opinion mid-negotiation.

"Pardon?"

He tilted his head slightly. "Your thoughts on these products."

Evelyn blinked. Why ask me? I'm not the business expert here.

Still, she dusted her hands lightly and stood. "They're impressive, certainly. But Mr. Blackwood mentioned innovation earlier?"

Donovan nodded eagerly. "Precisely. To date, no one else has replicated our designs."

Evelyn surveyed the displays. "The craftsmanship is remarkable. The variety of styles, the attention to detail—and the option for customization is a smart touch."

"Exactly! We prioritize originality to ensure customer satisfaction. Our packaging is also designed for practicality, whether for gifting or personal use," Donovan explained.

She hesitated before voicing her next thought. "They're beautiful, but... innovation invites imitation."

Her gaze drifted toward the bustling street outside. Countless shops sold Olivella Soap, and nearby factories mass-produced generic versions. Uniqueness never lasted long.

Donovan sighed in agreement. "You're absolutely right. Knockoffs have already appeared, though none match our quality. Still, long-term, we need stronger differentiators—which is why we're eager to collaborate with Mr. Kensington."

His hopeful glance shifted to Dominic, but the man's focus remained fixed on Evelyn. "Well?" he prompted. "What do you think?"

Evelyn barely resisted the urge to pinch him. What do I think?

The shop was lovely.

But was he seriously considering buying it?
###Chapter 374

A mischievous idea flashed through Evelyn's mind.

Noticing Alexander's expression, she couldn't resist teasing him.

With a playful smile, she quipped, "This boutique is rather charming. Why don't you purchase it, Mr. Kensington?"

It was clearly just a jest.

Even the wealthiest businessmen needed thorough consideration before acquisitions. This wasn't like impulse-buying dresses.

But she'd forgotten - Alexander wasn't ordinary. For him, acquiring such a store was as effortless as grabbing coffee and pastries.

"Alright," he responded casually.

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock.

"Excuse me?!"

Alexander chuckled inwardly.

"B-But..." Evelyn studied his face and realized he wasn't joking. Quickly backpedaling, she amended, "I was only teasing! Please don't take me seriously. You should properly evaluate before acquiring businesses."

"No evaluation needed. If it pleases you, that's sufficient."

Alexander dismissed the matter with barely a blink, as if hesitation itself was wasteful.

'What does he mean by "pleases me"? It was just a joke!' Evelyn opened her mouth to protest when she spotted Nathaniel.

She remembered their prearranged meeting.

Had this been planned all along? Were they simply using her remark as convenient pretext?

"You'd already intended to buy this store, hadn't you?" Evelyn inquired after brief consideration.

Alexander shook his head.

"Not at all. I'd considered minority investment, but if you fancy it, full acquisition poses no issue."

He turned to Nathaniel. "That's acceptable, yes?"

Nathaniel nodded eagerly.

"Absolutely! Provided you maintain cooperation with Blackwood Enterprises, acquiring this boutique is no trouble, Mr. Kensington. We own several similar establishments - feel free to select others as well."

Evelyn fell silent. Perhaps she'd overcomplicated matters.

Maybe business decisions required less deliberation than she'd imagined.

"You may proceed if you wish, but as mentioned earlier, knockoffs will flood the market soon. Even inferior craftsmanship will divert significant business. Are you certain about this investment?"

Evelyn studied Alexander curiously. He glanced down, smiling.

"Concerned I'll go bankrupt and fail to support you?" he teased.

Here she was discussing business prospects, and he turned it into flirtation.

"Should that occur, I'd have to depend on you," Alexander half-joked.

Evelyn frowned in confusion.

Alexander's smile deepened mysteriously before shifting to business demeanor. Addressing Nathaniel seriously, he declared, "Proceed as discussed. Arrange contract signing for later."

"Excellent. Our CEO eagerly anticipates this collaboration, Mr. Kensington."

Nathaniel beamed with satisfaction.

'Nathaniel Blackwood, Donovan Blackwood, and Blackwood Enterprises - clearly a family affair!' "Incidentally," Nathaniel inquired curiously, "might I ask who this lovely lady is?"
###Chapter 375

Nathaniel Blackwood stared at Evelyn Carter intently, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"You're the manager of this project."

Evelyn blinked in shock.

Since when was I made a project manager? What exactly am I in charge of? I don’t even know what this project is about!

"Nice to meet you, Ms. Carter," Nathaniel said warmly.

"Your name sounds familiar."

His eyes brightened with realization.

"Ah, now I remember. You're the winner of the recent perfumery competition in Valmont—Evelyn Carter. That was you, wasn’t it?"

Evelyn hadn’t expected word to spread so fast, reaching even those in Marseille. His company specialized in Olivella Soap, not perfumery. Yet here he was, recognizing her. She supposed she had gained some recognition.

"Yes, that’s me," she admitted with a nod.

Nathaniel’s expression lit up.

"It really is you! What an honor to meet you! To be honest, Mr. Kensington, I was skeptical when you mentioned combining perfume with Olivella Soap. But if Ms. Carter is leading the project, I have nothing to worry about. I look forward to collaborating with you!"

Evelyn was speechless.

"I—I’ve never done anything like this before. I can only promise to do my best."

Perfume and Olivella Soap? She was hearing about this for the first time. She had no idea where to even begin.

How was she supposed to pull this off? She shot Alexander Kensington a glare.

"You’re being too modest, Ms. Carter," Nathaniel continued. "Your victory in Valmont brought us immense pride. You might not realize it, but we’ve faced discrimination in this industry for years. Celestia Group is globally renowned for its cosmetics and fragrances, yet they’ve always looked down on us."

"Your win proved them wrong. You’ve done something remarkable for all of us."

Nathaniel gave her an earnest thumbs-up. His praise wasn’t flattery—it was genuine. Evelyn felt a swell of pride, knowing she had made an impact. But she also knew this was just the beginning.

There was still so much ahead.

After some further discussion, they left with a few samples of Olivella Soap Nathaniel had prepared for them.

Once outside, Alexander reached for her hand, but Evelyn pulled away.

"Are you upset with me?" he asked, sensing her mood.

"Because I didn’t tell you beforehand?"

"So you do know," she muttered.

Evelyn shot him a sideways glance. "You said we were going out for fun. Instead, I walked into a business meeting completely unprepared. You could’ve at least warned me before making me the project manager!"

She had held back earlier, not wanting to argue in front of Nathaniel. Now, she let her frustration show.

Alexander chuckled at her puffed cheeks.

"It was a business meeting, but I didn’t lie about having fun. Look—you even got gifts!"

He waved the bag of Olivella Soap samples teasingly.

"I don’t want them!"

Evelyn huffed, turning away and storming off.
###Chapter 376

Evelyn didn’t despise Olivella Soap, but she found it disingenuous to disguise corporate gifts as personal ones.

"Seems this gift isn’t impressive enough for you," Alexander remarked, catching up to her effortlessly and blocking her path. "No matter. I have others."

Evelyn had no choice but to stop, glaring at him as he stood in her way.

"Another corporate gift in disguise?" she challenged.

Businessmen never missed an opportunity to turn everything into profit. Even during what was supposed to be a casual outing, Alexander Kensington couldn’t resist weaving business into it.

"Of course not!"

She studied him for a long moment before finally extending her hand. "Fine. Where’s my gift?"

He handed her the small bag he’d been holding, amusement in his eyes. "I thought you didn’t want it."

"I changed my mind."

Opening the bag, she examined its contents.

Unlike commercial soaps laden with synthetic fragrances, these carried only the faintest trace of vegetable oil. No matter their shape or hue, their scent remained identical—only the intensity varied.

Earlier, she hadn’t fully grasped his meaning, but now, it clicked.

"You want me to create essential oils to blend with Olivella Soap," she deduced. "That way, each bar can have a unique fragrance, making them more appealing to consumers. Expanding the market."

What set Olivella Soap apart was its pure vegetable oil base—primarily olive oil—which gave it a high moisturizing quality. But its natural scent was overpowering, leaving little room for other fragrances. As Nathaniel Blackwood had pointed out, despite the intricate designs, the soap was easily replicated.

Most customers didn’t scrutinize craftsmanship. Without innovation, the market would inevitably shrink.

In business, stagnation meant regression.

The slightest hesitation could mean being overtaken.

Blackwood Enterprises understood this—striking before competitors could seize the advantage.

It was a shrewd move.

"You’re brilliant," Alexander praised without restraint. "That’s exactly why I trust you with this project."

"And what makes you so sure I’ll succeed?" Evelyn countered. "Olivella Soap has existed for centuries. If no one’s managed this before, isn’t it possible they all failed? Are you certain I can pull it off?"

It was a challenge, and she loved challenges. But personal interest was one thing—business was another. Failure here carried consequences.

"I believe in you," he said, unwavering. "You’ll have my full support. More importantly, I know you can do it."

His confidence left little room for refusal.

"I won’t guarantee success," she warned after a pause.

"That’s fine," he replied smoothly. "You’ll never discover how many ways there are to fail if you don’t try."

Well, if the CEO himself was this optimistic, why should she hesitate?

As he said—there were countless ways to fail.

She might as well test just how many.
###Chapter 377

Evelyn assumed Dominic would return to The Chateau Royale after wrapping up his business negotiations.

She never anticipated he'd whisk her away for dinner instead.

Dominic turned to her, his gaze steady. "Did you get a chance to try the restaurant I recommended?"

Evelyn's mind flashed back to that chaotic afternoon at The Canopy. She hadn't seen Oliver since the incident and often wondered how he was faring.

Food allergies weren't uncommon—plenty of people suffered from them.

From lactose intolerance to shellfish reactions, some even had adverse responses to grains like millet or simple ingredients like eggs.

The possibilities were endless when it came to dietary restrictions.

While ignorance about one's own allergies was understandable, Penelope was Oliver's mother. How could she not know?

"Is there anything you'd like?"

Dominic slid the menu toward her, aware of her fluency in Laurentian.

Evelyn absently touched her earlobe and shook her head. "I'm not familiar with the cuisine here. You order—I'll eat anything."

Truthfully, she preferred the flavors of home.

Even though Laurentia boasted exquisite dishes, Evelyn had never quite acquired the taste for them.

"Since we just toured the Olivella Soap factory, why not try the Mariner's Stew and steaks for the main course?" He skimmed the menu, then paused. "We drove here, so no alcohol. Agreed?"

Evelyn nodded, so Dominic ordered two glasses of freshly squeezed orange juice before handing the menu back to the waiter.

"Still upset with me?" Dominic asked, noticing her subdued demeanor.

"Why would I be?"

His question snapped her out of her thoughts. She'd been lost in reflection.

"You bought me gifts and took me to dinner. What's there to be upset about?"

Dominic smirked. "Seems like dinner was the right move."

"Not necessarily. I haven't tasted the food yet. We'll see if it was the right call," she teased lightly.

Soon, their dishes arrived.

The presentation was elegant, though Evelyn couldn't identify half the ingredients.

"Try it," Dominic encouraged, effortlessly slicing his steak into perfect cubes.

The stew looked rich and inviting, so she ladled some into her bowl. "This is the... Mariner's Stew?"

"Exactly. You're supposed to dip the bread into it as you eat," he explained, gesturing to the freshly baked loaf.

Evelyn hesitated but followed his lead. "And then?"

"If you don't mind garlic, spread some Saffron Aioli on the bread too."

Internally, she'd already decided this wasn't her kind of meal.

But Dominic had gone out of his way to bring her here, carefully considering her preferences. The least she could do was try.

She took a cautious spoonful of the stew—and was immediately hit with an explosion of seafood flavors.

The broth was a complex blend of herbs and spices, fragrant with a subtle kick of heat.

The intensity made her cough.

Dominic set down his knife and passed her a napkin. "Well?"

"It's... vibrant. Bold," she admitted after a moment.

And she meant it. The stew had a distinct, savory depth.

Unfortunately, her palate wasn't refined enough to pinpoint the ingredients. Her nose might be exceptional, but her taste buds? Not so much.
###Chapter 378

"What kind of Veridian fish was used in this dish?"

Evelyn tried to recall the taste of the stew. She couldn't pinpoint the exact fish, but she detected hints of garlic, bay leaf, fennel, and a touch of saffron.

The most dominant flavors were the tangy acidity of tomatoes, the sweetness of onions, and the earthiness of celery.

There were also a few vegetables she usually avoided—she had never been fond of them—but in this stew, they blended seamlessly, their presence subtle rather than overpowering.

"There isn't a specific Veridian fish used in Mariner's Stew," Alexander explained with an amused smile when he heard her question.

Evelyn immediately realized she had asked something foolish.

Mariner's Stew was traditionally made with whatever fresh catch was available that day. The type of fish didn't matter—it was about the medley of flavors.

She was relieved that only Alexander had witnessed her slip-up.

"Then what kind of fish was in this particular stew? I couldn't identify it," Evelyn said, taking another spoonful. The taste was rich, layered with the briny depth of shellfish and the sweetness of shrimp.

Too many flavors intertwined, making it impossible to isolate just one.

"That's the beauty of it. Every batch is different," Alexander replied.

He wiped his hands on his napkin, then reached for her untouched steak, swapping it with his own plate.

"You don't actually like this dish, do you? Try the steak instead," he suggested.

Evelyn blinked. Had she been that transparent?

She didn't hate the stew, but she certainly hadn't been enthusiastic about it either.

"I know you dislike celery and onions. And you despise ginger. You're also not particularly fond of fish, right?" He listed her preferences with unsettling accuracy.

"How do you know that? I never told you!"

Evelyn was picky, but she wasn't the type to make a fuss about food. She had never voiced her dislikes around him.

Alexander smirked and tapped his temple. "You didn't have to. I have eyes."

Evelyn had no retort.

Fine. He had a point.

Still, she eyed her bowl of golden-orange stew. "If you knew I don't like fish, why order a fish stew?"

Alexander leaned back, feigning innocence. "Life's too short not to try new things, isn't it?"

Then he chuckled. "Alright, I'll stop teasing. I ordered it because I wanted you to experience Veridian's local cuisine. You don't love fish, but you don't hate it either. I've seen you enjoy baked salmon and poached cod before."

He tore off a piece of bread, soaking it in the broth before popping it into his mouth.

Evelyn was startled by how well he knew her habits. And truthfully, after the first hesitant bite, she had wanted another spoonful.

At first, she had been skeptical, but once the herbal notes bloomed on her tongue, she found herself craving more.

This stew was dangerously addictive.

Just as they were finishing their meal, Evelyn's phone buzzed. The caller ID read Isabella.

It was unusual for her to call out of the blue. Evelyn answered.

"Isabella?" she asked, puzzled.

"Evelyn, did Dominic call you?" Isabella's voice was urgent.
###Chapter 379

Evelyn instinctively glanced at Alexander before responding to Sophia. "No, why?"

Sophia exhaled in relief. "Good. That means he doesn’t have your number."

"Right," Evelyn confirmed.

"He called me yesterday, asking if I had your contact. When I asked why, he wouldn’t tell me." Sophia’s voice carried concern. "But he sounded agitated, and I was afraid he might stir up trouble for you. You didn’t give him your number, did you?" She pressed again, needing reassurance.

Evelyn scoffed, rolling her eyes. "Why would I? Honestly, I’m being generous just by not blocking him."

"That’s what I wanted to hear. I refused to give Dominic your number, so don’t worry." Sophia hesitated before adding, "Still, with today’s tech, if he really wanted to find you, he could. I just needed to warn you. At least now you know he’s looking for you. I was afraid he might be planning something."

The moment Sophia ended the call with Dominic, she had dialed Evelyn immediately. She had tried prying the reason out of him, but he had only demanded Evelyn’s number with unsettling urgency.

Given Dominic’s usual behavior, nothing good ever came from his persistence. So Sophia had stood her ground. But knowing him, he wouldn’t give up easily.

"Don’t worry about him," Evelyn said dismissively.

She wasn’t afraid of Dominic. Even if he tried to cause trouble, she knew him well enough—he was all bark and no bite.

"Alright, just be careful. I can’t wait for you to come back."

Unaware that Evelyn was with Alexander, Sophia kept reminding her to stay vigilant.

"Don’t stress. I’ll be back soon."

Evelyn ended the call and noticed Alexander’s intense gaze fixed on her. His food remained untouched.

She touched her cheek self-consciously. "What? Is there something on my face?"

"Is there a problem?" Alexander asked bluntly.

Evelyn shook her head.

"No, everything’s fine."

She realized she no longer cared about Dominic.

Maybe it was because so much had happened since then. Or maybe it was simply that their breakup was ancient history, and whatever feelings she once had were long gone—like a distant, half-forgotten dream.

Now, looking back, she saw him for what he was: a minor footnote in her life. His attempts to grab her attention were nothing more than pathetic theatrics. She felt nothing for him anymore.

Alexander didn’t press further. He trusted her answer.

Instead, he asked, "Are you full?"

Though Evelyn hadn’t eaten much, the rich stew and the steak he had cut for her were more than enough.

After settling the bill, they returned to the car.

"Are we heading back to Crestview?" Evelyn asked as she fastened her seatbelt.

Before Alexander could respond, his phone rang.

For the past few days in Roseroot, his phone had been unusually silent. Evelyn had found it strange—normally, he was constantly bombarded with calls.

If she hadn’t known better, she might have thought he was trying to reinvent himself—from a ruthless, workaholic tycoon to a carefree playboy.

The truth was, Alexander had muted most notifications. He didn’t want work interfering with their time together.

Only urgent matters got through.

But this wasn’t a regular call.

It was a video call through WhatsApp. His phone lay between them, and both glanced down at the screen simultaneously.

The caller ID read: Cassandra Winslow.
###Chapter 380

Evelyn's eyebrows arched in surprise.

First, she noticed it was clearly a woman's name flashing on the screen.

That wasn't the shocking part.

The real issue was seeing Alexander's brow furrow deeply.

With one sharp tap, he declined the call.

Before his hand could return to the steering wheel, the phone rang again.

The persistent ringing alone was enough to set nerves on edge.

Exhaling sharply, he rested one arm on the window ledge while reaching to reject the call again.

Evelyn caught his wrist.

"Answer it. Might be important."

"I can step out if you'd prefer privacy," she offered, already unbuckling her seatbelt.

"Unnecessary." Alexander tugged her back. He swiped to answer with a curt, "What?"

"Sob...sob...sob..."

The sound of hysterical weeping filled the car, making Evelyn blink rapidly. Was she hearing things?

Alexander's jaw tightened visibly. His patience was clearly wearing thin.

"Call back when you can speak properly."

The line went dead. Evelyn didn't know whether to laugh or cringe.

Classic male response.

It solved nothing. Within seconds, the phone lit up again.

Alexander answered with a sharp tap.

This time, no tears.

Instead, a shrill voice screeched, "You hung up on me! Alex! How dare you! You vanished without a word! You're ignoring my texts! You've never treated me this way before!"

"I'm abroad. State your business or I'm hanging up."

His tone left no room for argument, fingers poised to disconnect.

Cassandra pouted audibly.

"I can't just call to talk? Where are you? Sebastian doesn't know, and Harrison refuses to tell me. When are you coming back?"

"Classified. Anything else?" Alexander replied coolly.

His gaze kept flickering to Evelyn. It was subconscious, but Cassandra's feminine intuition screamed danger.

"Who are you looking at? Is someone there?"

Her face suddenly filled the screen as she leaned aggressively toward the camera.

Alexander recoiled. "What are you doing?!"

"There is someone! A woman, isn't it? Who is she?"

Her voice climbed octaves with each accusatory question.

"Someone's here. Not your concern. I'm hanging up now."

"No—"

A piercing shriek made Evelyn clap her hands over her ears.

'Good grief, that banshee wail!' she thought.

The scream cut off abruptly as Alexander terminated the call. Evelyn opened her mouth to ask if he expected another call.

Then she watched him immediately block the number and all associated social media accounts.

Evelyn was stunned.

This would only fuel Cassandra's obsession.

As Alexander started the engine, he caught his wife's amused sidelong glance. He shifted uncomfortably.

"The Winslows are family friends. Cassandra's practically a sister."

Evelyn's lips twitched. "Sister?"

The word sounded foreign on his tongue.

Clearing his throat, he amended, "Yes, sister. There's nothing... beyond that."

"Nothing what?" she pounced.

Alexander froze. Normally unflappable, seeing him flustered was unexpectedly entertaining.

The more he squirmed, the more she wanted to tease. His explanation was unnecessary anyway.

A man of his stature had women throwing themselves at him constantly. That gorgeous face was practically a magnet for trouble.

"Evelyn," he groaned.

He sighed, about to elaborate, but she waved him off. "Relax. Everyone has a past. I get it. Really."

Her breezy dismissal only irritated him further.

"What past?"

"Just drive. No need to dwell on trivialities."

Her magnanimous air suggested she was above petty jealousy. Which, ironically, made him seethe.

"You're not even slightly jealous?"

"You said she's like a sister. Why would I be?"

She batted innocent lashes.

Technically true, but her complete lack of reaction gnawed at him. Jaw clenched, Alexander focused on the road, clearly bothered.

Evelyn dozed off peacefully in the passenger seat, oblivious to his dark mood.

She awoke as the car stopped in the hotel's underground garage. Perfect timing.

"Such a smooth ride. Didn't feel a thing," she praised, unbuckling her belt.

Alexander remained silent.

'Heartless woman. Doesn't care at all.'

He sighed, torn between admiring her composure and resenting her indifference.

Only upon entering their suite did Evelyn sense the storm brewing.

'Why's Alexander brooding? That phone call?'

'Did my presence complicate things? He severed ties with a family friend because of me...'

Deciding to reassure him, she casually remarked while unpacking the Olivella Soap, "No need to burn bridges. She might've had genuine business."

"Now that you've blocked her, future encounters will be awkward, no?"

She examined the soap carefully, mentally noting its composition for her new formulation.
###Chapter 381

The engine purred to life as Dominic finished his task and started the car. His wife, Evelyn, gave him a lingering look that made his fingers tighten around the steering wheel.

Instantly, he felt exposed.

"Cassandra's family and mine go way back," he explained quickly. "She's practically like a sister to me."

Evelyn arched a brow, amusement dancing in her eyes. "A sister?"

The word sounded strange even to his own ears.

Dominic cleared his throat. "Yes. There's nothing else between us."

"Nothing else?" she pressed, tilting her head.

He froze.

Evelyn hadn’t meant to tease him, but seeing the usually composed Dominic Reeves flustered was too entertaining to resist. The more he squirmed, the more she wanted to push.

She knew better than to worry. A man like him—wealthy, devastatingly handsome—had women throwing themselves at him daily. The fact that he even bothered to explain was telling.

"Evelyn," he sighed, exasperated.

She waved a hand dismissively. "Relax. Everyone has a past. I get it."

Her casual dismissal only deepened his frown.

"What past?"

"Just drive. No need to overthink it."

She leaned back, the picture of nonchalance, as if his explanation hadn’t affected her in the slightest.

Dominic’s jaw clenched.

"You’re not even a little jealous?"

"You said she’s like a sister. Why would I be?"

Her innocent blink only irritated him further.

Gritting his teeth, Dominic focused on the road, but the weight of her indifference settled heavily in his chest.

Beside him, Evelyn dozed off, her breathing steady.

She truly wasn’t jealous.

The woman’s voice on the phone had sparked a flicker of annoyance, but Dominic had shut it down so fast, his nervous explanation had erased any lingering doubt.

If there was something between them, he wouldn’t have hesitated to tell her.

Evelyn slept soundly, oblivious to the storm brewing beside her.

When the car rolled to a stop, she stirred awake, blinking at the hotel’s grand entrance.

"Your driving’s smooth. I barely felt a thing," she praised, unbuckling her seatbelt.

Dominic remained silent.

She really doesn’t care at all.

He didn’t know whether to admire her trust or resent her indifference.

Only when they reached their suite did Evelyn finally notice his mood.

Why does he seem upset? Was it the call earlier? Did he cut ties with Cassandra because of me?

She bit her lip. If he’d damaged a lifelong friendship over a misunderstanding, she needed to fix it.

"You shouldn’t have ended things so harshly with her," she said gently. "She might have needed you for something important. Now it’ll be awkward when you see her again."

Evelyn pulled out the Olivella Soap, turning it over in her hands. She needed to study its composition before she could innovate.

Dominic’s silence stretched.
###Chapter 382

Dominic watched Evelyn's back with a raised brow, his voice icy as he demanded, "Do you honestly believe I should remove her from my blocked list?"

"Obviously!" Evelyn nodded emphatically, convinced it was the rational choice.

Her fingers traced the smooth surface of the Olivella soap as she continued working, her tone pragmatic. "You said your families have been close for decades. Cutting her off completely isn't realistic, is it? Even if you block her, what then? Avoid every family gathering? Never speak to her parents again? You should talk it out like adults. Blocking her is just..."

"Just what?" His voice dropped dangerously low as he pushed away from his desk and closed the distance between them.

"Nothing!"

Evelyn pressed her fingertip into the soap, testing its firmness before chuckling at the indentation left behind.

"I just think it's a bit... immature."

'She cried in front of him once, and he blocked her on everything? As if they won’t cross paths again at some society gala or family dinner? Please.' Having spent years navigating the intricate social webs of the Hawthorne family, Evelyn understood how these connections worked. Wealthy families like the Kensingtons and Winslows were bound by decades of shared investments, alliances, and obligations. Personal feelings couldn’t sever those ties so easily.

Especially over something as trivial as a tantrum.

Cassandra had acted out—nothing more.

Evelyn laid out her thoughts logically, unaware of the storm brewing in Dominic’s expression.

"You're calling me immature?"

The sudden proximity of his voice made her stiffen. She turned—and there he was, looming over her, his jaw tight, eyes dark.

'Oh. He’s furious.'

"I didn’t say you were immature," she backtracked hastily. "I meant the situation with Cassandra—"

Before she could finish, his hands seized her waist, yanking her against him. His mouth crashed down on hers, swallowing her words in a punishing kiss.

'Mmph—!'

Evelyn’s eyes flew wide.

'Weren’t we having a serious discussion? Why is he kissing me now? And why does he look like I’m the one who provoked him?'

When he finally pulled back, letting her gasp for air, she could only guess at the source of his anger.

"Are you... embarrassed because you blocked her first and now you can’t take it back?"

'Men and their pride. He probably regrets it but won’t admit it.'

Dominic’s expression darkened further—just as his phone rang. The sharp, insistent chime of a video call cut through the tension.

"You unblocked her already?" Evelyn arched a brow. 'Persistent, isn’t she?'

His frown deepened. He hadn’t unblocked anyone. But video calls were rare for him. With a terse exhale, he reached for his phone.
###Chapter 383

Evelyn leaned in, curiosity getting the better of her. The name Sebastian Winslow flashed across Alexander’s screen.

She glanced at Alexander.

His jaw was tight, his gaze sharp with irritation. Yet, he answered.

"What?"

Sebastian froze. Maybe it was the ice in Alexander’s tone, or the way his expression could cut glass.

He had come prepared with a rant, but now, words failed him.

A soft laugh escaped Evelyn.

She caught a glimpse of the man on the screen—his wide-eyed, deer-in-headlights look was priceless.

Poor timing.

Alexander was already in a mood, and Sebastian had chosen this exact moment to video call.

"There’s a woman with you?"

Sebastian’s ears were sharp. Even Evelyn’s quiet amusement hadn’t gone unnoticed.

His voice returned with a vengeance. "Alex! So it’s true! Cassie was right—some temptress has gotten her claws into you!"

Evelyn’s lips parted in disbelief.

Alexander’s expression darkened further. "Say that again."

Sebastian choked.

The sheer menace in Alexander’s voice was enough to make him shrink back.

But pride flared. I’m here for my sister. I can’t back down now.

"Prove me wrong!" Sebastian squared his shoulders. "Show me your room! And what’s this sudden trip to Laurentia about?"

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed.

We’re married. Legally.

From the name and the way Sebastian spoke, she pieced it together—this was Cassandra’s brother.

Here to play the knight in shining armor.

"Sebastian Winslow."

Alexander’s voice was slow, deliberate.

His expression hadn’t changed, but the temperature in the room dropped.

Sebastian’s spine prickled.

"What?"

"Are you trying to die?"

Silence.

Then—

"Dude!" Sebastian whined. "Don’t take it out on me! Cassie’s been crying nonstop since you blocked her. She’s driving me insane. You get it, right?"

"She’s your sister."

Wow. Zero sympathy.

"You’re heartless!" Sebastian accused.

Evelyn smirked. Great minds think alike.

"Humanity is reserved for humans," Alexander said flatly.

Sebastian blinked. "What?"

He’s calling you inhuman. Brutal.

Evelyn bit her lip. Alexander’s cutting remarks were an art form. She was just glad she wasn’t on the receiving end.

"Nothing. Are we done?" Alexander’s thumb hovered over the end call button.

"Wait!" Sebastian blurted. "What about Cassie? You can’t just leave her like this. Are you really cutting her off forever?"

He couldn’t believe Alexander would go that far.

This was just a temporary punishment.

Cassandra needed to learn her lesson, but Sebastian didn’t want to be her emotional punching bag.

"We’ll see," Alexander said, tone indifferent.
###Chapter 384

"Sure, but—"

Before Sebastian could finish, Alexander cut him off with that chilling tone again. "Sebastian..."

"What now?"

Sebastian suppressed a shiver. Why does he have to say my name like that? It’s downright terrifying.

"Don’t video call me again."

Sebastian blinked. "W-Why?"

Deep down, he knew Alexander’s answer wouldn’t be flattering, but curiosity got the better of him.

"Because you’re hideous."

The call ended abruptly.

Sebastian was left gaping at his phone, while Evelyn, who had been listening in, burst into muffled laughter.

Is he always this ruthless with his friends? No wonder he’s made so many enemies. Then again, he probably doesn’t care.

Watching Alexander’s interactions was like witnessing a comedy sketch—except she had to stifle her amusement. She had failed earlier, letting out a soft giggle that Sebastian had definitely caught.

And since he’d called her a siren who’d bewitched Alexander, she made a mental note to pay him back later.

"Why are you so amused?" Alexander’s voice snapped her back to reality.

She was sprawled on the couch, face buried in a throw pillow, shoulders shaking with silent laughter.

"I’m fine," she lied, sitting up but failing to wipe the grin off her face.

"It’s just… being your friend must be exhausting."

If Alexander spoke this bluntly to someone as close as Sebastian, she could only imagine how brutal he was with mere acquaintances. The realization made her wary—this man was not to be trifled with.

"Exhausting?"

Alexander leaned down, caging her between his arms and the couch. His gaze was intense.

"Good thing you don’t have to be my friend, then."

Evelyn blinked. "Oh?"

His lips curved. "You just have to be mine."

Her breath hitched. Where did that come from?

Before she could process it, he shifted gears. "Let’s talk about Cassandra. You’re really not jealous?"

Evelyn groaned internally. Why is he fixated on this? Shouldn’t he be glad I trust him?

Cautiously, she tested the waters. "Should I… be?"

His expression darkened instantly. "That’s not the right question."

She frowned. Then what is? You’re impossible to read!

Biting her lip, she decided to humor him. "Fine. I’m furious. Tell me everything about Cassandra—no, every woman you’ve ever been close to. And swear you’ll never have another female 'family friend' again. Got it?"

For a second, his tense shoulders relaxed.

Then she ruined it. "…Was that the right answer?"

Alexander stared at her, utterly speechless.
###Chapter 385

It was Evelyn's first time making Alexander truly furious. He simmered in silence all night, refusing to speak a single word to her.

Though he didn’t raise his voice or lash out, the tension in the air was palpable. His displeasure radiated off him like heat from a furnace.

Is he upset because he thinks I’m jealous… or because I’m not?

Evelyn had little experience navigating romantic entanglements.

When she was with Dominic, jealousy had never crossed her mind.

Back then, she had been too focused on building their future together, naively believing Vanessa was just a mutual friend. The thought of Dominic betraying her with Vanessa had never even occurred to her.

When the truth came out, she had felt nothing but rage—betrayed, used, deceived.

Looking back, anger had overshadowed any heartbreak.

Jealousy? None.

Now, she wondered—did Alexander want her to be jealous?

But he had insisted nothing was going on between him and Cassandra. So why should she feel anything at all?

Before she could untangle her thoughts, her phone buzzed.

Serena.

"Evelyn, you haven’t left yet, have you?"

"Not yet. My flight’s tomorrow."

Evelyn had just finished showering.

She stepped out of the bathroom, towel-drying her hair, and found Alexander already asleep in bed.

Quietly, she dressed and slipped into the living room to take the call.

"Perfect! You have to meet me for dinner tonight!"

Serena’s voice turned remorseful. "You got kidnapped because of me. I’ve been drowning in guilt. Let me make it up to you—please."

Evelyn softened. "It wasn’t your fault. Those men impersonated your staff. You had no idea. Don’t blame yourself."

She hesitated, glancing toward the bedroom.

"If lunch doesn’t work, dinner then! I won’t take no for an answer!"

Serena barreled on before Evelyn could protest. "Oh! And Donovan Blackwood is coming too!"

"Donovan Blackwood?"

Evelyn’s mind flashed to the Marseille soap merchant. "You know him?"

Serena laughed. "Of course I do! We met him together at the hospital, remember? You saved his son. He’s been dying to thank you properly."

Realization struck.

The hospital. The little boy.

She had completely forgotten the man’s name.

"Serena, you really don’t—"

The line went dead before she could finish.

"Plans?"

A deep voice startled her.

She whirled around.

Alexander stood in the doorway, shirtless, his sculpted frame outlined by the dim light.

Even in the shadows, he was breathtaking.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

She had seen him like this countless times, yet the sight still sent her pulse racing.

"When is it?" He pushed off the doorframe and strode toward her.

Evelyn blinked, snapping out of her daze. "I thought you weren’t speaking to me."

Alexander pulled her into his arms. "Why wouldn’t I?"

She scoffed. "Yeah. Why wouldn’t you?"
###Chapter 386

"Only heaven knows!"

The way Evelyn rolled her eyes was utterly endearing to Alexander, drawing an amused smile from him.

Joy radiated from his gaze, spreading warmth across his features like sunlight melting winter frost.

"Alright, let's leave the past behind. No more dwelling on it," he murmured.

Then, he reached out, fingers brushing lightly over her hair. "Who called?"

Evelyn huffed, smoothing down the strands he'd ruffled. Let bygones be bygones?

He was the one who stormed off yesterday. Now he’s acting like nothing happened?

But seeing Alexander back to his usual charming self, she decided not to press the issue.

"Serena called. She invited me to dinner tonight, and I agreed. So—any plans for you? If not, I’ll go meet her."

"None at all. Go ahead."

His lips curved into that effortless smile of his.

Truthfully, Alexander had two more business meetings lined up.

Since they were already in Laurentia, he intended to wrap up all pending matters in one go.

"By the way," he added casually, "did I hear you mention a Mr. Blackwood?"

Evelyn burst into laughter.

"You thought it was the same Mr. Blackwood from yesterday? That was my first reaction too when Serena brought him up. But no, just a coincidence—same surname. This one’s the father of a little boy I helped. He wants to thank me personally. Isn’t it strange? Almost every Veridian I’ve met here shares that name. Did their entire bloodline migrate here or something?"

Though she said it lightly, Alexander’s interest sharpened.

Is "Blackwood" really that common among Veridians in Laurentia? Or am I reading too much into this?

Still, he was far more intrigued by his wife’s unexpected heroics.

"When did you save a child?"

They’d barely been apart a few days, yet she’d already woven herself into another story.

"Pure chance," she shrugged. "I was at a restaurant, and the boy had a severe allergic reaction. I knew basic first aid, so I stepped in. Didn’t think much of it afterward."

Alexander dipped his head, pressing a kiss to her temple.

"You’re incredible. Is there anything you can’t do?"

She ducked away with a giggle. "You should be asking what I can do instead!"

Then, darting toward the bedroom, she called over her shoulder, "And just so we’re clear—you’re not invited today!"

Alexander clutched his chest dramatically. "Such cruelty! You wound me!"

Her laughter echoed through the room.

Evelyn and Serena had arranged to meet at noon.

The mysterious Mr. Blackwood claimed to be a busy man, yet he’d insisted on expressing his gratitude properly—lunch or dinner, whichever suited them.

Though he’d suggested lunch, citing an evening client meeting.

Typical businessman. Evelyn rolled her eyes. Just like Alexander—every second scheduled, even during what’s supposed to be a personal gesture.

Honestly, she hated these formal interactions.

She’d much rather be elbow-deep in petals and essential oils, crafting her next fragrance.
###Chapter 387

The moment Evelyn stepped into the luxurious venue, her breath caught. The Veridian elite clubhouse shimmered with understated opulence, every surface polished to perfection.

At the mention of her name, a uniformed attendant guided her upstairs.

Though not a private dining area, the entire second level stood deserted.

Floor-to-ceiling windows wrapped around the space, bathing the restaurant in golden afternoon light. A string quartet played softly in the corner, their melodies weaving through the air like silk.

"Evelyn!" Serena's voice rang out across the empty floor.

Even without the greeting, Evelyn would have spotted her friend immediately. Aside from the discreet staff, Serena was the sole occupant.

"Serena!"

They embraced warmly, the familiar scent of Serena's jasmine perfume enveloping Evelyn.

As they parted, Serena offered an apologetic smile. "Donovan got held up in a meeting. He asked me to convey his sincerest apologies for the delay."

"That's quite alright," Evelyn assured her. "Really, this is all unnecessary. He already expressed his gratitude for what happened."

Serena shook her head firmly. "You don't understand. This isn't just about thanks. It's about propriety."

She leaned closer, lowering her voice. "You have no idea of Donovan Blackwood's standing in Veridian society. Saving his heir? If he didn't acknowledge that properly, it would cause talk."

Evelyn remained silent. The intricate dance of social expectations always left her slightly dizzy.

"How is Oliver doing?" she asked instead.

Serena's face brightened. "Perfectly healthy, thanks to you. I nearly lost my mind that day. Watching Oliver struggle like that... I couldn't think straight. If you hadn't been there..." She shuddered. "Donovan would never have forgiven me."

"Why would he blame you?" Evelyn sipped her sparkling water, brow furrowed. "You didn't serve the food that triggered his allergy."

A shadow crossed Serena's face. "No. That was Penelope's doing."

"The boy's mother?"

Evelyn recalled the distraught woman from that day, sensing the tension between her and Donovan. She'd assumed it was private family business and hadn't pried.

"Yes." Serena exhaled heavily. With no other distractions, she seemed eager to unburden herself. "Penelope was using Oliver to mend fences with Donovan. I thought... well, I thought reconciliation would be good for everyone. How wrong I was." She reached across the table. "I should apologize for Penelope's behavior toward you."

Evelyn waved it off. "Ancient history."

She could intellectually understand Penelope's panic - a mother watching her child suffer because of her own mistake, terrified of losing whatever fragile connection remained with the father. But understanding didn't equate to forgiveness.

"You're being too generous," Serena insisted. "That woman doesn't care about Oliver at all. Only herself. The incident showed her true colors."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

"If she truly loved her son," Serena continued, anger sharpening her words, "she'd know his allergies. When Oliver started choking, her first concern wasn't for him - it was whether Donovan would punish her. She knows Oliver is her only tether to Donovan's world. The child himself means nothing to her."

The venom in Serena's voice shocked Evelyn. Clearly, the incident had severed whatever sympathy existed between the two women.

"Maybe she just panicked," Evelyn offered weakly. "Or doesn't fully understand Oliver's condition. From what I gathered, she and Donovan aren't exactly..." She trailed off, realizing she was venturing into delicate territory.
###Chapter 388

Serena shook her head, a knowing smile playing on her lips. "They never even married. How could they possibly divorce?"

Evelyn gasped.

Her first thought was how shockingly progressive people overseas could be. How did a couple have a child together without ever tying the knot?

"Actually, Oliver was just part of Penelope's scheme," Serena murmured, exhaling heavily.

Her gaze drifted to the window, lost in memory. She knew all this because she had once considered Penelope a friend—even pitied her.

"Scheme? He isn't Donovan's son?"

"Oh, he is. Penelope was obsessed with Donovan. Completely infatuated. She swore she'd marry him, but he barely glanced her way. So, she... engineered things. Got pregnant with his child, thinking he'd have no choice but to marry her. But Donovan? He didn’t even want the baby. She refused to terminate the pregnancy, though. Insisted on keeping him."

Serena took a sip of water, her throat dry from talking.

"Then, she showed up with Oliver, begging Donovan to reconsider. He took the boy in, gave her a hefty sum, and still refused to marry her. Years later, Oliver grew up, and suddenly, Penelope wanted to 'reconnect'—trying to play the doting mother while angling for another shot with Donovan."

She paused, shaking her head.

"Evelyn, I used to feel sorry for her. Loving someone that deeply and getting nothing in return? I thought she deserved happiness. A child needs both parents, right? But after what happened at the hospital... I finally understood why Donovan never gave her a chance."

Evelyn stayed silent, absorbing the bombshell. She’d come for dinner, not a family drama exposé.

But now, it made sense why Penelope knew nothing about Oliver’s condition.

She hadn’t raised him. Hadn’t even cared. She’d just used him as leverage to trap a man who never loved her.

Disgusting.

Their conversation lulled as Evelyn glanced around. The restaurant was eerily empty.

"Is it too early for dinner? Or... is this place not doing well? Why are we the only ones here?"

Serena laughed.

"Donovan wouldn’t take you to some failing restaurant. This place is always packed. He just... booked out the entire venue for tonight."

"What?"

"Consider it his way of thanking you. You do realize how influential he is, don’t you?"

"That’s... excessive."

Evelyn had expected a simple dinner. Not a private takeover of one of the city’s most exclusive spots.

"For Donovan? This is pocket change." Serena smirked. "Besides, you saved his son."

"True."

Just as she said it, another voice chimed in.
###Chapter 389

Donovan Blackwood overheard their conversation as he approached and smoothly joined in.

"Mr. Reeves."

Evelyn Carter stood and gave a polite nod when she saw him. He motioned for them to sit while keeping a firm but gentle hold on a small boy beside him.

"Hello, everyone," Oliver Blackwood greeted with impeccable manners. His voice was clear and warm, carrying an innocence that made him instantly endearing.

"Hello, Oliver," Serena Whitaker replied with a bright smile. She had met him before and found him charming.

Evelyn offered a small nod as well.

"Hello."

The little boy clutched a neatly wrapped gift box in his tiny hands.

After releasing his father’s grip, he walked directly to Evelyn and presented it to her with both hands.

"Ms. Carter, my dad told me you saved me. I can’t ever repay you, but this is a small thank-you gift. I hope you like it."

Despite his young age, he spoke with surprising eloquence. Had Donovan been the one to offer the gift, Evelyn might have hesitated, but coming from a child, she assumed it was something simple—a token of gratitude rather than an extravagant gesture.

Her heart softened, and she accepted it with a smile. "Thank you, Oliver."

Pleased, Oliver quickly retreated to his father’s side, the picture of a well-mannered child. Evelyn couldn’t help but admire him. It pained her to think of the struggles he faced with his allergies.

Once everyone was seated, Donovan asked, "Have you ordered yet?"

Serena smirked playfully. "We wouldn’t dare start without you, would we?"

He chuckled. "You should have. I hate keeping people waiting. My apologies."

Without glancing at the menu, he summoned the waiter and effortlessly listed off several dishes before turning to Evelyn.

"Is there anything you don’t eat? Or any favorites? I wasn’t sure if you’d be comfortable with the cuisine here, so I kept the options varied."

"I’m not picky," Evelyn assured him.

She rarely had strong preferences when dining out, especially when she wasn’t the one paying—or when she wasn’t particularly close to the host.

"Are fries alright?" Donovan asked, his tone softening as he looked down at Oliver.

The boy nodded eagerly.

"Can I have ketchup with them?"

For a brief moment, Donovan’s expression tightened, and he didn’t respond immediately. Oliver’s face fell slightly, but then his father gave a reluctant nod.

"Fine. Just a little."

Oliver brightened instantly.

Evelyn noticed the subtle shift in the child’s demeanor and remembered what Serena had mentioned about his complicated background.

The thought that Oliver had been brought into the world not out of love, but as a means to an end, made her chest ache.

"Honestly, as long as you avoid known allergens, it should be manageable," she interjected gently.

Donovan lifted his gaze to hers, his voice quiet but firm. "The problem is, we don’t actually know what his allergens are."

Evelyn blinked. "What do you mean?"

Allergies usually had clear triggers—dairy, nuts, shellfish, pollen. Once identified, avoidance was straightforward. But Donovan was implying they had no concrete list.

Did he not pay enough attention to his son’s health?

After finishing the order, Donovan poured Oliver a glass of warm water before explaining.

"Oliver’s condition is… unusual. His first reaction happened when he was two—goat’s milk. We thought avoiding that would be enough. Then it was bread. Then peanuts. Foods he’d been fine with before suddenly became dangerous. His reactions are unpredictable. That’s why we can’t pinpoint his triggers."
###Chapter 390

Evelyn could tell Serena wasn’t joking.

The little boy’s complexion was fair, almost porcelain-like, but it wasn’t the healthy glow of youth. Instead, it was pale and fragile, tinged with something unsettling.

"How did this happen?"

"It might be genetic, but we can’t say for sure. The world is vast, and some illnesses remain incurable. It’s not uncommon," Donovan replied, his tone measured, as if discussing the weather rather than his son’s condition.

Evelyn’s gaze lingered on Oliver, her heart clenching. The boy, sensing her sympathy, offered a small, reassuring smile. "It’s okay, Miss. I’m used to it. Really."

His words only made her chest tighten further.

He was just a child—so young, yet already so resigned.

What a sweet, heartbreaking boy.

"There’s no treatment at all? With medical advancements, surely there’s hope?"

Donovan shook his head. "We’ve consulted countless specialists. His condition stems from a genetic defect. A cure is… unlikely."

His words carried the weight of years of dashed hopes.

"But Oliver is still young," Serena interjected, her voice bright with forced cheer. "Medicine evolves every day! And for now, his condition is stable. Sure, he has dietary restrictions, but there’s still plenty of delicious food he can enjoy, right?"

Oliver ducked his head, his shy smile barely hiding his discomfort.

"Yes, there’s time," Donovan agreed, clearly eager to shift the conversation. "Speaking of which—congratulations on your win at the perfumery competition. I haven’t had the chance to properly celebrate you yet."

He raised his glass. "To Evelyn Carter, the rising star of Laurentia’s perfume world."

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured, lifting her own glass.

Serena, never one to be left out, clinked hers against theirs. "Me too! Evelyn, you’re incredible! My father hasn’t stopped singing your praises since the competition. And trust me, he never does that."

Evelyn chuckled softly. "I appreciate it."

"But why did you turn him down?" Serena pressed, pouting. "If you’d accepted his offer, you could’ve stayed in Laurentia! We could’ve seen each other all the time!"

Donovan arched a brow, intrigued. "Ah, yes. I’ve been wondering the same. Laurentia is the heart of the perfume industry. The opportunities here are unparalleled. Why leave?"

It wasn’t the first time someone had asked her that.

Evelyn’s smile was faint but resolute. "Laurentia is wonderful, but… my heart belongs elsewhere."

"Ah, a patriot," Donovan mused, a knowing glint in his eye.

"Not patriotism," she corrected gently. "It’s nostalgia."

For home. For friends. For the people she loved.

Those were the ties that bound her—the ones she couldn’t bear to sever.
###Chapter 391

"Do you miss them?" Serena asked, tilting her head in confusion.

"I recall you mentioning you don't have any family. Or… a boyfriend, perhaps?" Evelyn replied with a knowing smile.

Instead of answering directly, Serena shrugged. "I do have family. We just don’t stay in touch much."

"A woman as remarkable as you must have suitors lining up," Donovan teased, leaning back in his chair.

Serena waved a dismissive hand. "You have no idea. Evelyn is brilliant, but she’s married to her work. If it weren’t for that jerk—"

She frowned, suddenly blanking on the name. Shaking her head, she continued, "Anyway, if he hadn’t been so persistent, I doubt she’d have ever settled down. Sorry."

Realizing she’d touched on a sore subject, she quickly backtracked. Serena didn’t know the full story—only what had happened to Evelyn recently.

"It’s fine," Evelyn said, her tone light. "That’s all in the past now."

"So… do you have a boyfriend?" Serena ventured cautiously.

Evelyn hesitated, then smirked. "I suppose you could say that."

Technically, it was two steps beyond boyfriend.

Alexander was her husband.

The thought made her lips twitch in amusement.

She’d never actually called him that to his face.

She wasn’t sure she could without laughing.

"Wow, you’ve been holding out on me! You have to introduce us sometime!" Serena beamed.

If Evelyn was seeing someone, it meant she’d truly moved on. That was something to celebrate.

"Evelyn’s partner must be extraordinary," Donovan mused, watching her reaction.

"Of course," Evelyn said without hesitation.

Alexander was extraordinary. He deserved every bit of praise.

Donovan raised an eyebrow, intrigued by her lack of modesty.

The meal passed pleasantly, but just as Evelyn was about to leave, a commotion erupted from the staircase.

"Let me through! Do you know who I am? How dare you stop me!"

The shrill voice was unmistakable.

Before Evelyn could place it, the woman stormed up the steps.

"Donovan, you can’t keep me from seeing Oliver!"

It was Penelope.

Evelyn hadn’t expected to run into her here, but Donovan had likely ordered the staff to block her entry.

The servers tried to hold her back, but she shoved past them, desperation fueling her movements.

Oliver perked up at the sound of his mother’s voice, but a sharp glance from Donovan made him sink back into his seat.

"Oliver! Oliver! Mommy’s here!" Penelope shrieked, oblivious to the other diners.

"Mr. Blackwood, I apologize—she just—" A flustered server stammered, wiping sweat from his brow.

Donovan dabbed his lips with a napkin, his expression unreadable. "Let her come up."
###Chapter 392

The server exhaled in relief at Donovan's words, quickly signaling for Penelope to approach.

Penelope rushed forward eagerly, only to freeze when she spotted Evelyn and Serena. Her gaze immediately snapped back to Donovan.

"Donovan," she began, voice trembling, "I went to the hospital and found out you took Oliver home. Why didn’t you tell me he was discharged? Do you have any idea how worried I was?"

"Since you can see he’s fine now, you can leave," Donovan replied flatly, his expression unreadable.

When Penelope failed to sway him, she turned her attention to the boy. "Oliver, thank heavens you're alright! I was so scared! This was all my fault—I’m so sorry! Are you feeling better? Do you want me to stay and take care of you?"

She reached out to embrace him, but Evelyn noticed Oliver instinctively flinch, his small body recoiling from his mother’s touch.

"You don’t need to take care of him. Just stay away," Donovan said coldly.

"Donovan, how can you say that? I’m his mother! You can’t just strip me of that right!"

He scoffed. "Really? Do you actually want to act like a mother?"

"Of course I do!" she shot back without hesitation.

Donovan gave a slow nod. "Fine. I’ll give you the chance now."

Before she could react, he continued, "Oliver is yours from today onward. I’ll petition the court to transfer full custody to you. I’ll pay child support monthly and cover his education until he’s an adult. But don’t expect a single cent beyond that. What do you say?"

Penelope paled, disgust flashing across her face. Meanwhile, Oliver clutched Donovan’s sleeve, his small fingers trembling. His downcast eyes brimmed with silent distress.

The boy had been silent throughout the argument, a pawn in the adults’ battle. The sight twisted Evelyn’s heart.

"Donovan, you can’t do this to me!" Penelope shrieked. "A child needs a complete family!"

"Did I cause this?"

His laugh was sharp, his words merciless. "Penelope, don’t insult my intelligence. We both know the truth. For Oliver’s sake, I’ve let the past go. But if you push me, I will make you regret it."

"Donovan—"

"Leave. Now. Before I lose my patience." His voice was ice.

Furious but powerless against him, Penelope whirled on Evelyn and Serena instead. "And why are you two here?"

Evelyn blinked, taken aback.

"I knew something was off that day," Penelope sneered. "You were trying to cozy up to Donovan, weren’t you?"

Her resentment from their last encounter still burned. Donovan dismissed her with ease, yet he treated Evelyn with warmth.

And Evelyn—beautiful, composed—was hiding something beneath that calm exterior. Penelope could feel it.

"Don’t even think about replacing me. Oliver is my son. Save your schemes."

Evelyn stayed silent.

"Penelope!" Serena cut in, indignant. "That’s enough! Evelyn has a boyfriend. Donovan invited her to thank her for saving Oliver! If it weren’t for her, Oliver would’ve—"

Penelope didn’t let her finish.

"Serena, shut your mouth! I trusted you, and now you’re siding with her? You introduced her to Donovan on purpose, didn’t you?"
###Chapter 393

"Me?"

Serena Whitaker didn't expect Penelope Rutherford to accuse her. She pointed at herself, shock and fury flashing in her eyes.

"You told me Evelyn was your friend the first time we met. You asked me to trust her, and I did. Now you're having dinner with her, my man, and my son? What's wrong with you?"

The more Penelope spoke, the more it sounded like an undeniable truth.

Serena was equally frustrated, nodding repeatedly. "Yes, I was foolish! Foolish enough to think I could help you reconcile with Oliver. Foolish enough to believe I could mend your relationship with Donovan. Go ahead, blame me! It's my fault for trusting the wrong person!"

"Serena," Evelyn called softly, trying to diffuse the tension before it affected the child.

She noticed Oliver trembling, his small fingers clenched tightly, shoulders hunched as if he wanted to disappear beneath the table.

If not for the distance between them, Evelyn would have pulled him into a comforting embrace. Her voice gave Serena an idea. She grabbed Evelyn's hand and declared, "You're right, Penelope. I'm terrible. From now on, I won't interfere. Evelyn and Donovan make a perfect pair, while people like you will never stand a chance!"

"How dare you?!"

Penelope shrieked, lunging forward—until a sharp crack echoed through the room.

Shards of glass scattered at her feet, some landing on her dress. Though unharmed, the sudden violence left her frozen.

Donovan, who had thrown the glass, remained composed. His expression was icy as he warned, "I'll say this once: get out of my sight, or else..."

His gaze was lethal, locking onto Penelope. "I'll make sure you disappear for good."

Penelope shuddered. Her shock melted into misery, her face crumpling with despair.

"Donovan, please! I admit I was wrong, okay? Just think about Oliver—your son!"

"Oliver?"

Donovan turned, only to find the boy no longer beside him. Oliver had squeezed his eyes shut, unwilling to witness the chaos.

Evelyn ignored the argument and moved toward him. She knelt beside him but stayed silent.

"Don't touch my son!"

Penelope's scream pierced the air. Donovan's voice thundered in response, "Leave, Penelope!"

The command choked her protests.

After one last fearful glance at Donovan, she swallowed her pride and muttered, "Fine. I'll go. Just... don't be angry."

She was terrified of him. Even with reluctance burning in her chest, she turned and walked away.

Before exiting, she shot Evelyn a venomous glare.

Evelyn didn’t notice. Her entire focus was on Oliver. She didn’t reach for him or speak—just sat quietly, inching closer until her foot lightly brushed his.

At the contact, Oliver instinctively pulled back, but Evelyn gently pressed closer again. She did nothing else—just kept her foot near his, a silent reassurance.

"Oliver," Donovan bent to pick him up, but Evelyn lifted her head and subtly shook hers, signaling him to wait.

Across from them, Serena watched in confusion but stayed silent. Both she and Donovan observed Evelyn’s strange yet tender approach.

Minutes passed before Oliver finally reacted. His eyelids fluttered open, and he turned his head—slowly, cautiously—to look at Evelyn.
###Chapter 394

Evelyn's lips curved into a warm smile when she caught his gaze.

Dominic was taken aback when she smiled at him. His tense expression softened as he studied her, and for the briefest moment, the ghost of a smile flickered across his face.

Then it was gone—so fleeting it might have been imagined.

Evelyn didn’t speak. Instead, she extended her hand toward him, palm up, fingers slightly curled in silent invitation.

He hesitated, staring at her outstretched hand before finally, cautiously, placing his small fingers into hers.

The moment his hand touched hers, Evelyn gently closed her fingers around his and beamed at him.

What happened next stunned her.

Oliver suddenly threw his arms around her, clinging tightly as if she were his lifeline.

Evelyn hadn’t expected this. She had only meant to comfort him, not provoke such an emotional reaction.

Holding him close, she stroked his back soothingly, sensing the distress radiating from his small frame.

Donovan watched the scene unfold, his eyes softening with something akin to relief.

Slowly, Oliver’s trembling subsided, and his grip on her loosened slightly.

Evelyn tried to stand while still holding him, but her legs wobbled—she had been sitting too long.

Donovan stepped forward, steadying her before carefully taking Oliver from her arms. "Thank you," he murmured.

With a gentle smile, Evelyn gave Oliver’s tiny hand a playful shake. "Just promise me one thing—no more arguing in front of him. It affects him more than you realize."

Donovan exhaled, nodding reluctantly. "I know." Then, almost wistfully, he added, "Oliver really likes you. If you’re not in a hurry to leave… maybe you could stay a few more days?"

Serena seized the opportunity, chiming in eagerly. "Evelyn, you have to consider it! My father’s team is incredible. The opportunities here are endless—your career would skyrocket!"

Donovan nodded in agreement. "She’s right. The industry here is thriving. With your talent in perfumery, you could achieve so much more. And if you ever need help, I’d be happy to assist."

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "No. My path is back home. I’ll carve out my own future, no matter where I am."

Her resolve was unshaken, but Oliver’s grip on her sleeve tightened, his eyes pleading.

"Miss Evelyn," he whispered, voice small and uncertain.

She softened, cupping his cheek. "If your father allows it, you can visit me someday. I’ll take you out for the best meal in town."

Oliver immediately turned to Donovan, waiting for confirmation.

Donovan’s lips quirked. "Definitely."
###Chapter 395

The business trip to Laurentia finally concluded.

Evelyn and Alexander Kensington boarded the same flight home.

Upon their return, daily routines resumed seamlessly.

Work consumed them immediately, their schedules packed with urgent matters.

This homecoming carried special significance.

Not just Evelyn's personal triumph, but Phoenix Labs' greatest achievement since its founding.

The international perfumery competition had changed everything.

Now the name "Phoenix Labs" would be recognized globally.

The world would remember their perfumer who outperformed elite competitors from every corner of the globe.

The office had prepared an elaborate welcome.

Streamers and balloons decorated the entrance when Evelyn arrived.

"Welcome back our champion!" Victoria Sterling led the cheering crowd.

Her applause sparked a thunderous ovation from the entire staff.

Even former skeptics now regarded Evelyn with newfound respect.

Previously, many had questioned her qualifications.

Some had doubted her selection for the Laurentia competition.

Pessimistic whispers had predicted failure.

Yet she'd achieved what no one in company history had accomplished.

The final judge being renowned perfumer Harrison Whitaker only validated her brilliance.

Their doubts had transformed into admiration. "Thank you all!"

Uncomfortable with attention, Evelyn offered a gracious nod.

"Evelyn, you've brought unprecedented honor to Phoenix Labs." Gregory Whitmore announced. "There will be official commendations and bonuses. First, please join me in my office for important matters."

"Mr. Whitmore, she just returned from an exhausting trip!" someone protested. "Shouldn't she rest first?"

"Exactly! Shouldn't we celebrate this victory?"

"How about a company dinner tonight?"

Cheers of agreement filled the office.

Victoria playfully waved her hands. "Hold on! This is Evelyn's achievement. Why are you all acting like you won?"

Her teasing tone drew laughter rather than offense.

A colleague countered, "Evelyn's victory elevates our entire company! Her success belongs to all of us!"

"Dinner tonight then! My treat!" another offered.

Gregory smiled. "Work first! We have challenging projects ahead. Prepare yourselves mentally!"

"Yes, sir!"

The staff dispersed with renewed energy.

Gregory gestured to Evelyn. "With me."

Though uncertain of his purpose, Evelyn followed.

He placed a fatherly hand on her shoulder. "My office. We have much to discuss."
###Chapter 396

"Alright,"

Evelyn nodded and followed Gregory to his office. He shut the door firmly behind them, casting a quick glance through the glass panel before adjusting the blinds. The space instantly took on a clandestine atmosphere, though he deliberately left enough visibility to avoid suspicion.

"Ms. Carter."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

The sudden formality caught her off guard.

"I wasn't aware of your... connection with Alexander Kensington earlier. My apologies if I've said or done anything inappropriate," Gregory admitted, rubbing his neck with visible discomfort.

Understanding dawned on Evelyn.

While Gregory knew she'd been assigned by corporate, her personal ties to Alexander remained undisclosed until now.

After the kidnapping ordeal, secrecy seemed pointless anyway.

Yet he clearly didn't know the exact nature of their relationship - only that something significant existed between them.

"Mr. Whitmore, Mr. Kensington and I..." Her voice trailed off meaningfully.

"No need for explanations," Gregory raised his hands. "Whatever it is, I won't pry. Your privacy is safe with me. Since discretion is necessary at work, I'll have to be more subtle about watching out for you."

"That would be ideal!"

Evelyn nodded emphatically. "Please treat me like any other employee. No special treatment. I'm here to work hard and contribute to Phoenix Labs' growth just like everyone else."

Gregory studied her face, finding only earnest determination. His shoulders relaxed slightly. "That's reassuring. Though I must ask - with your connections, why choose our small subsidiary over Celestia Group itself?"

Phoenix Labs, while backed by the corporate giant, remained modest in scale and influence.

What could possibly attract someone with her advantages?

"Mr. Whitmore, you know my circumstances when I first arrived. Given my qualifications then, I was grateful for any opportunity. Phoenix Labs may be small, but I see its potential. The energy here is electric - I truly believe we're building something extraordinary."

Her words visibly pleased him.

"The growth possibilities for Phoenix Labs are practically boundless in my estimation!"

"Absolutely!"

She affirmed with conviction.

"Well then! That settles it."

Gregory exhaled deeply, tension leaving his frame. Ever since Alexander's unexpected inquiry about Evelyn, he'd been walking on eggshells. Discovering an ordinary employee was actually the boss's special interest had thrown him completely.

Balancing professional discretion with unspoken obligations had become a daily tightrope walk.

Too much workload? Unacceptable. Too little? Equally problematic.

Maintaining normalcy while knowing the truth proved exhausting.

This candid conversation lifted a weight off his shoulders.

"Very well, you may go. You've been pushing hard lately - take the afternoon off if you need. Consider it approved," he offered generously.

"No thank you," Evelyn smiled, already turning toward the door. "I'd rather get back to work now that we've cleared the air."
###Chapter 397

The moment Evelyn stepped out of Gregory's office, she headed straight for Victoria's workspace.

Victoria was already waiting, champagne bottle uncorked and three crystal flutes arranged neatly on the desk. Isabella stood beside her, grinning.

Clearly, they had prepared a private celebration.

"Celebrating with alcohol during office hours? You two are incorrigible," Evelyn teased, shaking her head in mock disapproval.

Victoria scoffed, waving a hand. "This isn’t drinking—it’s a toast to victory! Now shut the door before someone sees."

Once the blinds were drawn and the door securely closed, the trio exchanged conspiratorial glances, feeling like rebels in their own workplace.

"Isn’t the official celebration tonight? Why the rush?" Evelyn asked, though she still picked up her flute with a smile.

"Tonight is for everyone else," Isabella countered, clinking her glass against Evelyn’s. "This is just for us. It’s special."

"Congratulations!" Victoria beamed. "I knew you’d crush the competition."

The air buzzed with excitement, especially from Isabella. She had watched Evelyn’s journey from the very beginning—the late nights in the lab, the meticulous blending of fragrances, the relentless pursuit of perfection. She had learned so much just by standing beside her.

Yet, despite their breakthroughs, recognition had always been elusive. Awards slipped through their fingers, and credit was often redirected elsewhere.

Isabella had once wondered if it even mattered. Wasn’t the real reward in the craft itself?

But deep down, she knew Evelyn deserved more. She was a diamond—brilliant, unbreakable, and impossible to ignore forever.

A platter of fresh fruit sat nearby, likely Victoria’s doing.

Taking a sip of champagne, Victoria’s expression turned serious. "By the way, what really happened in Laurentia? We couldn’t reach you for days. It was terrifying."

Isabella nearly choked on her drink. "Kidnapped?!"

She whirled toward Evelyn, eyes wide. "You were kidnapped and didn’t tell me?!"

Victoria blinked. "Wait, you didn’t know?"

"No, I didn’t!" Isabella set her glass down with a sharp clink. "Who took you? How did you escape? Are you hurt?"

The rapid-fire questions made Evelyn exhale in exasperation. "It was weeks ago. I’m fine now."

"Why didn’t you tell me?!" Isabella’s voice rose, then she rounded on Victoria. "And you! You knew and kept it from me?"

Victoria threw her hands up. "I only found out after it happened! Preston called me asking if I’d heard from her—how was I supposed to know the details?"

"You could’ve mentioned the kidnapping part!"

"I didn’t know there was a kidnapping part!"

Evelyn held up a hand. "Enough. Whatever happened, I’m standing here unharmed, aren’t I?"

The two women fell silent, then pointed accusingly at her in unison.

"Explain. Now."

Evelyn sighed.

And then said nothing.
###Chapter 398

Evelyn gave a rough account of her kidnapping in Laurentia but carefully avoided mentioning Alexander Kensington's frantic trip to find her.

She also downplayed her own role in dealing with the kidnappers, making it seem far less dramatic than it had been.

Even so, her two closest friends, Sophia and Victoria, turned pale at the mere retelling.

"Wait—they had guns?!" Sophia gasped, clutching her chest.

"They must have been part of some underground syndicate!" Victoria added, her voice trembling.

"How did you even get out of that alive?"

The two exchanged stunned glances.

Just picturing the scene sent chills down their spines, and seeing Evelyn standing there unharmed seemed nothing short of miraculous.

Victoria reached out, squeezing Evelyn's hand. "Evelyn, are you sure you're okay? If anything happened—anything at all—you have to tell us."

Sophia nodded vigorously. "Exactly! Don't bottle it up! No matter what they did, we're here for you. We'll keep it between us!"

Evelyn blinked, then let out a dry laugh. "Why does it sound like you two wanted something terrible to happen to me?"

"Of course not!"

"Don't even joke about that!"

For once, the two were in perfect agreement.

Sophia huffed. "We're just worried about you! Now, tell us—did the police catch the mastermind? Who was behind it? Why target you?"

"The mastermind..."

Evelyn's mind flashed to Lucien Dubois, arrested by the authorities, and Vanessa Blake, who had vanished from Laurentia shortly after. She didn’t know the full aftermath—only that Lucien and his men had been taken into custody.

Given the evidence against them, their sentences wouldn't be light.

Before they could delve deeper, a commotion erupted outside Victoria's office.

Frowning, Victoria set down her coffee and marched to the door. "What's going on out here? The celebration isn't until tonight! Get back to—"

She froze mid-sentence.

The employees weren’t slacking off—they were all pressed against the windows, staring in awe at the spectacle outside.

Dozens—no, hundreds—of vibrant balloons were rising into the sky, their ribbons fluttering in the breeze. The sight was almost surreal.

"Where did these come from?" Victoria muttered.

Then she spotted it.

Tied to each balloon was a long satin ribbon, each bearing the same bold declaration:

"I LOVE YOU, EVELYN."

Victoria immediately slammed the door shut and whirled around. "Evelyn! Look outside!"

The blinds in Victoria's office had been drawn, so none of them had noticed the display until now.

Victoria yanked them open, revealing the breathtaking scene.

Balloons filled the sky, each one carrying its heartfelt message upward.

Evelyn could only stare, speechless.

Was this some kind of elaborate joke?

Or was it something far more serious?
###Chapter 399

Evelyn knew Alexander would never pull such a flashy stunt, so she was utterly confused.

Her first thought was that someone was playing a cruel joke on her.

The balloons ascended gracefully, painting the sky with vibrant colors.

Women in the crowd sighed at the romantic display, leaning out of windows to catch a glimpse of the mysterious sender.

"Look! There's a man down there!"

"Where? Oh my—he's holding flowers!"

"A massive bouquet! Are those... ninety-nine red roses?"

Gasps of admiration filled the air, and soon, all eyes turned toward Evelyn's office with envy.

The three women inside stood frozen.

At first, Sophia assumed it was Alexander's doing—until she saw Evelyn's expression.

Evelyn wasn't smiling.

Curious, Sophia peered out the window.

The man below was too far to recognize at first, but when he glanced up, her breath hitched.

"Dominic?!"

No one expected Dominic Reeves to orchestrate this spectacle.

Sophia shot Evelyn a worried look.

Evelyn's face darkened further.

"That worthless ex?" Vanessa scoffed, crossing her arms. "What, he suddenly remembers you exist?"

Sophia muttered, "This reeks of ulterior motives."

Dominic had never so much as bought Evelyn coffee during their relationship. Now, roses? Balloons?

Still, it wasn't her place to interfere.

"Are you going down?" Sophia asked carefully.

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line.

Answer enough.

"I'll handle it," Sophia offered, turning toward the door.

Evelyn stopped her with a raised hand.

"No need."

She pulled out her phone and dialed with icy calm.

"Hello? I'd like to report illegal littering. Yes, environmental pollution. The address is..."

Sophia and Vanessa exchanged impressed glances.

Meanwhile, Dominic stood proudly on the pavement below, clutching his extravagant bouquet.

He had meticulously styled his hair, dressed in a crisp white suit—Evelyn's favorite color.

She once said white symbolized purity.

He thought this grand gesture would melt her heart.

Instead, uniformed officers approached him.

"Sir, were you responsible for releasing those balloons?"

Dominic blinked.

"Yes, why?"

He had no idea what was coming.
###Chapter 400

"Sir, we've received a complaint that you're littering in public and violating environmental regulations. Please come with us for questioning," one of the officers stated firmly.

Dominic Reeves' expression twisted in disbelief. "I just released a few balloons. How is that pollution? There are vendors selling balloons on every street corner—why aren’t you arresting them?"

"Minor quantities are permitted, but excessive releases disrupt public spaces and carry legal consequences. You’ll need to take responsibility for this."

Dominic scoffed. "What consequences? Who exactly did I harm?"

The officer adjusted his cap and gestured toward the office building. "A formal complaint was filed. Your actions interfered with workplace operations."

"Who complained? Tell me who it was! I want to face them directly!" Dominic's voice rose as he jerked his arm away. "Do you even know who I am?"

Being escorted away in cuffs would be humiliating, but his resistance only worsened the situation.

Originally, he might have gotten off with a fine. But his defiance ensured they followed protocol to the letter.

Dominic had meticulously planned this grand gesture, yet it had collapsed before Evelyn Carter even glimpsed it. Authorities hauled him away without her ever knowing he was there.

Upstairs, Evelyn and Victoria Sterling watched the scene unfold through the window, satisfaction curling their lips.

"Evelyn, that was brilliant," Sophia Grant exclaimed, clapping her hands. "You defeated him without lifting a finger!"

Victoria smirked. "I haven’t laughed that hard in weeks."

Evelyn had extended kindness to Dominic before, only to be met with cold indifference. Now he dared to reappear, expecting her to play along? Ridiculous.

"Pathetic," Evelyn murmured, shaking her head.

She didn’t know what Dominic hoped to achieve with such a spectacle, but it reeked of desperation. Their relationship was over. The theatrics only proved how little he understood her.

Outside the office, whispers buzzed among the staff. None suspected Evelyn had orchestrated Dominic’s removal—they only saw a man in a suit being led away by officers.

"Alright, everyone, back to work!" Victoria called, shooing them off. "This doesn’t concern any of you."

Once the door shut, she turned to Evelyn. "It’s quiet for now, but he might try something else. Are you still planning to avoid him?"

"Let’s just have him arrested again," Sophia quipped.

Victoria arched a brow. "And if this keeps happening? What will the company think? Not to mention—" She paused meaningfully. "You do have a new boyfriend now. What if Alexander Kensington hears about this?"

Sophia’s eyes widened. "Oh. Right." She glanced nervously at Evelyn.

The unspoken implication hung heavy—Alexander wouldn’t take kindly to an ex causing public scenes.

Evelyn exhaled. "I’ll handle it."

Her tone was calm, but resolve steeled beneath the words. This ended now.
###Chapter 401

The truth was, Victoria had a point.

This endless drama was beyond exhausting.

Evelyn believed her chapter with Dominic Reeves had closed, yet he kept reappearing in her life like a stubborn stain.

Work-related interactions were understandable, but this? Summoning the police had been a temporary fix at best.

With no serious charges, he'd pay a fine and walk free by sunset.

Then what? Would he show up again tomorrow?

"Something troubling you?"

Alexander's arms encircled her from behind. He'd been engrossed in a novel but noticed her drowning the same philodendron for ten straight minutes.

The poor plant's soil had become a miniature swamp.

"Hmm?"

Evelyn blinked, finally registering the overflowing planter. "Oh!"

She moved toward another pot, but Alexander confiscated the watering can. "Let's spare the greenery, shall we?"

Empty-handed, she pursed her lips. "Think I'm a menace?"

Alexander's silence spoke volumes.

Since when did emotions require permission slips?

"If you're determined to wreak havoc," he murmured against her knuckles, "wreck me instead."

The line was so unexpectedly poetic that laughter bubbled from Evelyn's throat.

Meeting his gaze, she ventured, "Maybe we should go public."

His fingers stilled around hers. "About us?"

Leading her indoors, he seated her on the sectional and fetched a linen towel. Each finger received meticulous attention as he dried them.

Despite constant exposure to lab chemicals, her hands remained porcelain-smooth—a genetic lottery win.

"I..."

Words tangled on her tongue.

"Related to today's balloon spectacle at Phoenix?" he guessed, dabbing between her fingers.

Evelyn's eyes flickered in surprise, then resignation. Of course he knew. Phoenix Labs fell under Celestia Group's umbrella, and that stunt had practically required a parade permit.

"I thought I'd drawn the line in neon," she sighed. "What's his endgame?"

"Simple." Alexander shrugged. "Ask him."

"You wouldn't mind?"

Dominic was her ex. Alexander knew every sordid detail.

The towel stilled. "Do you still want him?"

No accusation colored his tone—just calm curiosity.

Evelyn's head shook so vigorously her ponytail whipped her cheeks.

Absolutely not. After his betrayal and the smear campaign? She'd need a prefrontal lobotomy to reconsider.

"Exactly." Alexander's smile was a slow sunrise. "No lingering feelings means you're just meeting a nuisance to set boundaries. Why would I care?"

His thumb traced her wedding band—a silent reminder of where her loyalties lay.
###Chapter 402

"If you want to handle this on your own, I won't interfere. But if it's too much and you'd rather not deal with it, I can step in," he tossed the towel aside, took her hand, and knelt before her.

His voice softened. "Just know that whatever you choose, I'll respect your decision."

Evelyn felt a sudden rush of emotion, her eyes stinging with unshed tears. She wrapped her arms around his neck, pressing her face into his shoulder. "Darling, you're so good to me," she murmured, her voice thick with sincerity. She truly meant it—she was lucky to have him.

Alexander froze, as if he hadn't heard her right. "What did you just say? Say it again."

"You're amazing," she whispered, nuzzling against him.

"No, not that—the other thing. Say it again."

He pulled back just enough to look into her eyes.

After all this time together, she had never once called him by anything other than his name or the occasional "Mr. Kensington." He had never pushed her to change, content to let her come to it in her own time.

But now, out of nowhere, she had given him this unexpected gift.

That single word had struck him right in the chest.

Evelyn bit her lip, her cheeks flushing under his intense gaze. She couldn't bring herself to repeat it. "I'm not saying it again," she teased, giggling as she tried to look away.

Alexander wasn't about to let her off that easily. He cupped her face, keeping her from turning away. "Come on, sweetheart. One more time."

"Nope."

When she couldn't turn her head, she rolled her eyes playfully instead.

"If you don't say it, I'll kiss you."

"Go ahead. It's not like you haven't kissed me before."

"You—"

He exhaled in mock frustration, unable to threaten her when she was being this bold. But before he could say anything else, Evelyn leaned in and pressed her lips to his.

It was soft at first, tentative—but then she deepened the kiss, her fingers tangling in his hair. She wasn't as practiced as he was, but she made up for it with sheer enthusiasm.

Alexander was momentarily stunned before he responded, guiding her with slow, deliberate movements.

When they finally pulled apart, both breathless, he didn't ask her to repeat those words again.

She had said it once. She would say it again.

He could wait.

But then—

Evelyn brushed her lips against his once more, then leaned her forehead against his. At this distance, she could count every one of his eyelashes, see the depth of emotion in his gaze.

She took a deep breath.

"I love you, darling." Every syllable was clear, deliberate.

Alexander's eyes widened.

Just when he thought he wouldn't hear it again tonight, she had given him another surprise.

He pulled her tight against him, kissing her over and over. "I love you too, sweetheart."
###Chapter 403

The Chateau Royale was the most luxurious five-star hotel in Veridian City, towering sixty-six stories high with a breathtaking view of the entire skyline.

Despite his wealth, Dominic Reeves rarely visited. In fact, he had only been there twice before—both times at a client’s insistence.

Yet today, he had personally reserved a table for Evelyn Carter.

His fingers tapped nervously against the pristine tablecloth.

Will she give me another chance? Or is this just another test?

Dominic wasn’t sure what Evelyn was thinking, but he clung to hope. After all, they had shared years together. That had to count for something.

He had dressed carefully—not in the stark white suit from yesterday, but in an off-white ensemble that accentuated his refined demeanor. The tailored fit made him look effortlessly elegant, the kind of man who turned heads without trying.

He arrived early, ensuring everything was perfect. The restaurant prioritized privacy, and tonight, it was nearly empty.

Good. No distractions. Just us.

Yesterday’s plans had been ruined by unexpected interference. This time, he wouldn’t let anything disrupt their reunion.

Dominic checked his watch for the fifth time in ten minutes.

Then—footsteps.

The sharp click of heels against marble.

He looked up—and froze.

Evelyn stood before him, and for a moment, he forgot how to breathe.

Her hair, usually tied back, cascaded in loose waves over her shoulders. A fitted knit dress hugged her curves, the neckline dipping just enough to be alluring without being indecent. A beige cashmere coat draped over her arm completed the look.

Dominic recognized the designer label instantly—this season’s most coveted collection.

But it wasn’t the clothes that stunned him.

It was her.

The pearls at her ears and throat glowed against her flawless skin, making her look almost ethereal.

He had known Evelyn for years, yet tonight, she was radiant in a way he’d never seen before.

“Y-You…” His voice faltered.

Evelyn reached for her chair, and he sprang up, hurrying to pull it out for her. He took her coat, hanging it carefully before returning to his seat.

“You look… incredible,” he managed.

A slow smile curved her lips. “Funny. I don’t recall you ever saying that before.”

Dominic winced. “I should have. I was blind.”

She tilted her head, watching him with amusement, as if he were a particularly entertaining spectacle.

He cleared his throat. “How have you been?”

“Perfectly fine,” she said, flicking an invisible speck off the table. “Aside from the occasional nuisance.”

Her gaze flicked to him pointedly.

Dominic swallowed the jab. He had expected this. If mockery was the price for her attention, he’d pay it gladly.

“I know I hurt you,” he said, voice low. “I was a fool. I let myself be deceived, and in doing so, I lost the best thing that ever happened to me.” He met her eyes. “I regret it every day.”

Evelyn’s expression remained unreadable.

Dominic leaned forward. “I mean it, Evelyn. I want to make things right.”

She studied him for a long moment before finally speaking.

“Prove it.”
###Chapter 404

"You're actually serious about this?"

Evelyn let out a melodic laugh that didn't quite reach her eyes. "I highly doubt that."

Dominic's fingers twitched against the tablecloth. "Then tell me what you want! Name your price. I'll do anything!" His voice cracked with desperation.

A dangerous smile played on Evelyn's lips. "Anything?"

She looked every bit the temptress in that moment - the kind of woman who could make kings abandon their thrones. The afternoon sunlight caught in her chestnut hair, creating a halo effect that made Dominic's breath hitch.

Then she lifted one perfectly manicured finger and pointed toward the floor-to-ceiling windows.

"Jump."

Dominic's face went pale. "Excuse me?"

"You heard me." Evelyn's voice was sweet as poisoned honey. "Sixty-six floors should be enough. Do it, and all is forgiven." Her smile remained, but her emerald eyes turned glacial.

Dominic's gaze darted to the window. The cityscape stretched endlessly below them, the ant-like cars moving along the streets. His stomach lurched.

"That's... that's insane!" He wiped his suddenly damp palms on his trousers. "Evelyn, be reasonable. I'm trying to make amends here—"

"Then prove it." Evelyn leaned forward, resting her chin on one hand. "Or are all those pretty words just empty promises?"

A nervous laugh escaped Dominic's lips. "You can't possibly expect me to—"

"Exactly." Evelyn's laughter rang out, sharp and mocking. "You won't even pretend to consider it. How... predictable."

Dominic's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water. He'd never seen this razor-edged version of Evelyn before. The woman before him was a far cry from the accommodating girl he'd once taken for granted.

"Shall we order?" Evelyn's tone shifted abruptly as she picked up the menu. "Unless you've already chosen for me again?"

Dominic seized the change of subject like a drowning man. "N-no! I waited for you." He signaled the waiter with more enthusiasm than necessary. "Order whatever you like. My treat."

Evelyn's eyebrow arched. "How generous." Her fingers trailed down the menu's offerings with deliberate slowness.

The irony wasn't lost on her. This was the same man who'd once complained about restaurant prices, who'd insisted home-cooked meals were superior in every way. Now he was practically begging her to drain his wallet at one of the most expensive restaurants in the city.

She selected the most extravagant items without consulting him, then handed the menu back with a satisfied smile.

"Now," Evelyn steepled her fingers, her gaze turning serious. "Let's stop playing games. What's this really about, Dominic? You've been acting strangely for weeks."

Dominic straightened his tie, visibly relieved to be on familiar ground. He reached across the table, attempting to capture Evelyn's hand.

"Give me another chance," he implored, his voice dripping with manufactured sincerity. "Let's start over, you and I. We were good together, Evelyn."

The words hung between them, as hollow as the man who spoke them.
###Chapter 405

"You want to start over?"

Evelyn arched a brow, her lips curling into a mocking smile as she studied Dominic's desperate expression.

Dominic mistook her silence for consideration, his voice dripping with false sincerity. "I know I was wrong before. I took you for granted, and I regret every moment of it. Just give me one more chance—I swear I’ll make it right this time."

The sheer audacity of his words made Evelyn shift in her seat, crossing her arms as she regarded him with cold amusement. "Oh? And how exactly do you plan to do that? What could you possibly offer me that I don’t already have?"

Dominic, blind to her sarcasm, leaned forward eagerly. "If you come back to me—to DR Holdings—I’ll give you everything. My connections, my resources, my influence. I’ll make you the most renowned perfumer in Veridia and beyond!"

Evelyn let out a soft, derisive laugh. "Funny. Wasn’t it you who told me I wasn’t good enough? That I should stay hidden in the lab, lest I embarrass myself in front of the industry?"

Her fingers tapped rhythmically against the table, each click a reminder of his past cruelty.

Dominic flinched. "I—"

"You said I was inexperienced," she continued, cutting him off. "That even if Veridian City knew my name, it wouldn’t matter in the international scene. That I should be content with mediocrity." She tilted her head. "So tell me, what changed in these few months? Or is it just that my success is now too visible for you to ignore?"

Dominic swallowed hard, his face flushing. "Evelyn, please—"

She didn’t let him finish. "And let’s not forget your little lecture on humility. How I should focus on formulas, not fame. How vanity would ruin me." She smirked. "Tell me, Dominic, do you even hear yourself?"

His words had been arrows once. Now, they were boomerangs, striking him right back.

Dominic, ever the coward, tried to brush it all aside. "Evelyn, can’t we just move past this? Forget the past and start fresh?"

Her laughter was sharp. "Fresh? You think I should just erase everything because it’s convenient for you?" She recoiled when he reached for her hand. "Or are you too spineless to even own up to your own words?"

"I’m not denying anything!" he protested, desperation creeping into his voice. "I’ve admitted my mistakes. It was Vanessa—she manipulated me, poisoned my mind. But I see clearly now. I was horrible to you. Yell at me, hit me, do whatever you want—just forgive me, please!"

Pathetic.

Even now, he was blaming Vanessa, just as he had once blamed Evelyn.

"Regret doesn’t erase what you did," she said, her voice icy. "And forgiveness? You haven’t earned it."

Dominic’s confidence wavered as her expression darkened. He had come prepared to grovel, but she wasn’t budging.

Before this meeting, he’d hired a private investigator to dig into her life—only to hit a wall. The Hawthorne family’s influence shielded her, but one detail had caught his attention.

Evelyn wasn’t just backed by her family.

Someone far more powerful stood behind her.

Someone from Celestia Group.
###Chapter 406

According to Dominic's source, Evelyn was recommended to Phoenix Labs by someone from the Celestia Group.

That explained why her entry into Phoenix Labs had been so seamless, granting her access to superior resources and care.

Dominic trusted his informant because he couldn't fathom why anyone would guide a newcomer into Phoenix Labs otherwise. At first, he suspected she had connections to an executive there.

Then he learned she was from the Hawthorne family and assumed she had leveraged their influence.

But that theory crumbled when his source revealed the name behind her recommendation...

Dominic clenched his jaw, his voice dropping to a low, tense murmur. "Evelyn, is there someone else? Is that why you refuse to come back to me?"

Surprise flickered in Evelyn's eyes. She thought Dominic had uncovered her relationship with Alexander. Her pulse quickened—she hadn’t planned for him to find out this way.

How? When did he learn about us?

Seeing her stunned reaction, Dominic’s suspicions solidified. She had moved on.

The realization twisted inside him like a knife.

Yet, after a moment of bitter calculation, he refused to surrender.

"I know this is my fault. I made you who you are now. Of course, you'd seek someone to lean on. But tell me—do you really think he deserves you?" His tone dripped with condescension, as if the other man wasn’t even worth considering as competition.

Evelyn stared at him, incredulous. "If he isn’t worthy, then what does that make you?"

Dominic’s arrogance was staggering. How could he possibly compare himself to Alexander? The sheer audacity!

"Obviously, I am!" he declared, puffing up with pride. "Sure, DR Holdings is small now, and I’m not in his position—but think carefully. He might seem impressive, but he’s just an assistant. That’s as far as he’ll ever go. Without Mr. Kensington, he’s nothing. Me? I’m building something real. Look at our latest product line—profits will double by year’s end. We’ll go public soon."

He leaned in, voice turning coaxing. "Evelyn, we have a future. If you stay with Harrison Sullivan, all he can offer you are temporary perks. Do you really think Phoenix Labs or Celestia Group obey him? It’s only because he works for Mr. Kensington. The second he’s fired, he’s worthless. Wake up. Come back to me."

Dominic looked at her like he was delivering a revelation.

Evelyn, however, had turned her face toward the window, one hand propped under her chin. Her shoulders trembled slightly.

She’s crying, Dominic thought, softening his tone. "Evelyn, just come home. I’ll treat you right this time. I’ll even rename the company for you. Instead of DR Holdings, we’ll call it Evie. Like your nickname. Elegant. Sophisticated."

He didn’t see the way her lips pressed together—not in sorrow, but to stifle laughter.

This was all one colossal misunderstanding. Dominic, just like Isabella before him, had mistaken Harrison for her lover.

Harrison wasn’t even part of this equation, yet here he was, dragged into the drama again.

Why does this keep happening to me? Evelyn thought, exasperated.

Dominic mistook her silence for hesitation.

He didn’t realize she was fighting the urge to burst out laughing at his delusions.
###Chapter 407

The air between them crackled with tension.

"Why don't you just hand over that insignificant little company of yours to Evelyn? Then she can rename it whatever she pleases, isn't that right?"

A deep, smooth voice cut through the silence.

A man strode toward their table and took the seat beside Evelyn without hesitation. "Apologies for being late," he murmured, his gaze briefly flickering to her. "I had some urgent matters to attend to."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

She hadn’t expected Alexander Kensington to show up unannounced, even though he’d told her to call if she needed help.

Dominic Reeves stiffened, his expression darkening. "Who the hell are you? How dare you interrupt—"

Then recognition struck.

His face paled. "Y-You're Mr. Kensington?"

Though they worked in the same industry, Dominic had never actually spoken to Alexander before.

Their circles were worlds apart.

Dominic had tried—and failed—to secure a meeting with the man through connections. DR Holdings was too small to even register on Celestia Group’s radar.

Yet here Alexander was, sitting across from him, one arm draped casually over the back of Evelyn’s chair.

The implication was clear.

Dominic’s mind reeled.

"I heard you’ve been trying to pursue my girlfriend?" Alexander asked, his tone deceptively light.

Dominic’s throat went dry. "I—I didn’t—"

His thoughts spun wildly.

Girlfriend? Evelyn? But wasn’t she with Harrison?

His hands trembled slightly, his pulse erratic.

Alexander leaned forward slightly, his voice low but carrying an unmistakable edge. "I overheard your little proposal. You seem quite confident in your career, Mr. Reeves. And from what I’ve gathered, DR Holdings has been performing well lately. Impressive marketing strategy."

Dominic forced a laugh, though it came out strained. "Ah, well, it’s nothing special—"

"Except," Alexander interrupted smoothly, "those two new products weren’t actually your creations, were they? They were Vanessa Blake’s work."

Dominic choked. "Well, technically, but—"

"Honestly, it doesn’t matter who made them," Alexander continued, waving a dismissive hand. "Consumers only care about the final product, right?"

Then his expression darkened.

"Unless, of course, the perfumer in question was involved in orchestrating a kidnapping. Or covering up for a known drug addict." He tilted his head slightly. "I doubt the public would still support those products then. And the annual perfume championship? Well, that would be out of the question. What a shame."

His tone dripped with mock sympathy.

Evelyn stared at Alexander, stunned.

Vanessa? Kidnapping? Drug addict?

Since when did any of this happen?

And how did Alexander know?
###Chapter 408

Dominic Reeves was just as clueless as Evelyn Carter about the recent events.

All he knew was that Vanessa Blake and Lucien Dubois had left for Laurentia. Nothing more.

Vanessa had cut all communication with him after her affair with Lucien was exposed, and Dominic hadn’t bothered to dig deeper.

Truthfully, he didn’t care enough to. Vanessa’s fate meant nothing to him—until DR Holdings’ new products were at stake.

Since they were still together when the fragrances were launched, both scents bore Vanessa’s name.

And even though she had betrayed him, it didn’t matter as long as the perfumes qualified for the championship.

Dominic had weighed his options and decided to keep her products in the competition—until Alexander Kensington dropped a bombshell.

"What do you mean? Vanessa masterminded a kidnapping? That’s impossible!"

Though he was no longer involved with her, Dominic was certain he knew her well enough to know she wouldn’t dare commit such a crime.

Vanessa was manipulative, yes. Materialistic, absolutely. But kidnapping? Covering for a drug addict? That was beyond her.

Who was this drug addict anyway?

"Instead of obsessing over things that aren’t yours, maybe you should pay attention to international news—especially in our industry," Alexander mocked.

"Take the advice or leave it. I’m just being generous."

"Shall we leave?"

Alexander turned to Evelyn, his gaze softening the moment it landed on her.

Nothing else existed in that moment—just her.

There was no reason for Evelyn to stay any longer.

Alexander’s presence alone was proof enough that she would never return to Dominic—no words needed.

From Dominic’s stunned expression, it was clear the realization had hit him hard.

"Okay," Evelyn nodded, rising gracefully under Alexander’s protective touch.

He draped his coat over her shoulders and guided her out, not sparing Dominic another glance.

But after a few steps, Alexander paused and turned back.

"Oh, and do the decent thing—pay the bill. You did invite Evelyn out, after all."

Evelyn had expected something serious—maybe a final warning.

Instead, she barely suppressed a laugh until they reached the lobby.

Alexander smirked. "Go ahead. Laugh."

And she did—so hard tears pricked her eyes.

"My presence delights you that much?" Alexander teased. "If I’d known, I would’ve shown up sooner. Maybe I should make a habit of it."

Evelyn shook her head, still grinning. "I thought you would pay."

She knew Alexander was more than capable of covering the bill without a second thought.

"He invited you. Why should I pay?" Alexander countered. "He should be grateful I didn’t order the entire menu."

Evelyn chuckled, imagining Dominic’s face when the check arrived.

Alexander had a way of getting under people’s skin—effortlessly.

"So," she said, tilting her head. "About Vanessa’s case. You swore you weren’t involved."

Her eyes sparkled with amusement—and accusation.

She knew better.
###Chapter 409

"I swear I had nothing to do with it."

Under Evelyn’s skeptical gaze, Alexander finally caved. "Okay, fine. Maybe I had a tiny part in it."

He pinched his fingers together, emphasizing just how insignificant his involvement was.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Really? Just a tiny part?"

First, he claims complete innocence, now it’s only a sliver of responsibility?

"It’s the truth! Barely anything!"

Alexander placed both hands on her shoulders, as if physical contact would make his words more convincing.

"All I did was hand over some intel to the Laurentia police. Just a few pieces of evidence suggesting Vanessa might be linked to the kidnapping. The rest was out of my hands."

"The arrest? The charges? That was all them. I barely lifted a finger, I swear!"

His expression was so earnest that Evelyn almost believed him.

"So… Vanessa was actually behind the kidnapping?" The revelation left Evelyn stunned.

She never would’ve guessed someone so seemingly gentle could be capable of something so dark.

Alexander shrugged. "Not sure."

Evelyn gaped at him. "You’re not sure, but you still tipped off the police about her?"

He tilted his head thoughtfully. "But I am sure she’s wanted to hurt you for a while now. I let her slide twice already. Third time’s not happening."

Evelyn couldn’t argue with that. Even if Alexander had nudged the investigation in Vanessa’s direction, his intentions were to protect her.

If Vanessa was innocent, the police wouldn’t have arrested her.

The fact that she had been taken in meant there was something Evelyn didn’t know.

She exhaled dramatically. "Wow. Just… wow."

If this were a TV show, Alexander would’ve had a heroic soundtrack swelling in the background right now.

"Doesn’t that mean I deserve a reward?"

He leaned in, his lips dangerously close to hers. Evelyn rolled her eyes but pressed a quick kiss to his cheek.

"Happy now?"

"You call that a reward?"

Alexander scoffed before taking matters into his own hands. "Let me show you how it’s done."

Just as their lips met, Dominic stepped out of the restaurant, his mood already sour—until he spotted them.

Jealousy twisted his gut.

The woman who had once been his, devoted and unwavering, was now laughing in another man’s arms.

He knew he’d lost her for good. Not just Evelyn, but the power and influence of the Hawthorne family behind her.

Regret burned through him as he imagined the empire he could’ve had. His nails dug into his palms hard enough to leave marks.

"E-Evelyn," he muttered under his breath, venom lacing his voice.

The night was alive around him—neon lights flickering, laughter spilling from bars, people chasing highs or drowning in liquor.

But Dominic stood frozen, consumed by fury.
###Chapter 410

The amber liquid swirled in Dominic's glass as he downed another shot. The dim bar lights blurred his vision, matching the haze in his mind. He'd never felt this hollow before—like the world had crumbled beneath him.

"Hey there, gorgeous. Drinking alone is such a waste." A sultry voice purred beside him as a woman with crimson nails traced circles on his forearm.

Dominic squinted through the alcohol fog. "Why not?" he slurred, barely registering her face.

A sudden force yanked the woman away mid-protest. Dominic staggered to his feet. "The hell—"

Cold air slapped his face as someone dragged him outside by his collar. His stomach lurched. "Who—what—"

The winter wind sobered him just enough to realize he was being shoved into a luxury car. The door slammed like a gunshot.

"Have you lost your damn mind?"

Ice-cold water drenched him. Dominic gasped, shock clearing his vision. The interior light revealed Genevieve Sinclair's sharp features, her designer coat untouched by the chaos.

"Mother, I—"

The dam broke. Dominic crumpled against her shoulder, sobs wracking his frame like a child scraped raw by the world. For once, Genevieve didn't correct his informal address. Her gloved hand hovered before settling on his damp hair.

When the storm passed, Dominic wiped his face with trembling hands. Genevieve thrust a monogrammed handkerchief at him. "Clean up. You're a Reeves, not some back-alley drunk."

"I've ruined everything." His voice cracked. "DR Holdings is finished. I'm—"

"Stop that pathetic whining." Genevieve's cufflinks glinted as she leaned forward. "Do you think I crawled out of poverty by weeping over spilled champagne? That bastard father of yours gambled us away like chips at a casino. I fought tooth and nail to marry into the Sinclair name while society laughed behind their fans."

Dominic flinched as her pearl necklace grazed his cheek. "Every diamond I wear was paid for in blood and scheming. And you're ready to surrender because of one setback?"

The car hummed with silence. Outside, neon signs painted Dominic's shame in garish colors. Genevieve's perfume—something expensive and unyielding—filled the space between them.

"I just... don't see a way out," he whispered.

Genevieve's laugh was razor-sharp. "Then open your damn eyes." She snapped her fingers. The driver pulled away from the curb, carrying them both into the glittering night.
###Chapter 411

"Stop this nonsense. It's merely the annual perfumery competition. So what if you're disqualified this year? There's always next time. Why are you making such a fuss?"

Genevieve Sinclair's perfectly arched eyebrows drew together in irritation.

"But we won't make the deadline!"

How could Dominic Reeves remain calm? Though the competition was still two months away, they'd already submitted their entry.

If changes were possible, DR Holdings would need extensive R&D time to create an entirely new product line - with no guarantee of success.

Even if they miraculously developed something new, Dominic couldn't promise it would be competition-worthy.

Most critically, his two flagship products were now tainted by association with a convicted criminal.

This scandal would inevitably damage both the perfumes' reputations and DR Holdings' standing in the industry.

Dominic needed immediate crisis management - salvaging his perfumes' image while crafting plausible explanations for his board of directors. The profit margins were his paramount concern.

With multiple crises converging, he felt utterly overwhelmed.

"Not necessarily impossible. Participant lists can still be amended one month before shortlisting. As for your company's predicament... I'll assist you."

Genevieve paused deliberately before adding her unexpected offer.

Dominic's eyes lit up with sudden hope. "You mean that?"

His mother never offered help.

Their unspoken agreement demanded absolute secrecy about their relationship. Dominic could never leverage her connections.

He'd built his empire alone. Only if he achieved substantial success would Genevieve consider acknowledging him publicly.

Should he fail, this secret would die with her.

That's why Dominic never sought her assistance, no matter how dire his circumstances - he knew better than to ask.

Which made Genevieve's sudden offer utterly shocking.

"Don't celebrate prematurely. First, answer me - what were DR Holdings' profit margins these past two quarters? What percentage came from your two new perfumes? I hear they're performing well currently."

Genevieve's questions came rapid-fire.

"Well..."

"There's more. Are you still profiting from Evelyn Carter's original formulas? The ones she created before joining Phoenix Labs? What's their contribution to your bottom line?"

"Have you conducted detailed profit comparisons between legacy and new products?"

"Do you maintain a regr client roster? How strong are those relationships? Any potential for increased orders?"

"How many perfumers remain on staff? Any exceptional talents among them?"

Genevieve bombarded him with increasingly specific inquiries about DR Holdings' operations.

"I... I..."

Truthfully, Dominic had grown complacent recently, assuming his company thrived. He'd been certain the board approved of their financial performance.

He'd fully expected Vanessa Blake's creations to win awards this year.

Even if Vanessa couldn't win as perfumer, her products would surely triumph based on quality and market reception alone. He'd envisioned industry respect and soaring profits.

His only remaining goal had been reclaiming Evelyn.

With her by his side, Dominic believed his future would be secured.

But that fantasy shattered when Evelyn chose Alexander Kensington. Then Vanessa's legal troubles erupted.

Now Dominic's world crumbled around him.

"Why are you stammering? Look at yourself! What have you accomplished all these years? How can you lack such fundamental knowledge? Must I teach you basic business management? How dare you neglect profit margins and client relationships?"

Genevieve's scathing reprimand cut through his panic.
###Chapter 412

"Mom! I'm so sorry, I messed up!" Dominic's voice cracked with desperation. "I thought we had everything under control, but then this happened. I never imagined Vanessa would be reckless enough to kidnap Evelyn. How could she do something like that? And..."

Dominic hesitated, stealing a nervous glance at Genevieve.

"I had no idea Lucien was a drug addict. His reputation is in ruins—everyone knows it!"

The truth had only come to light after Dominic dug deeper, desperate to understand why Vanessa had vanished and why Lucien had suddenly gone silent.

Now it all made sense. The authorities in Laurentia had arrested them.

"Enough. He deceived me too."

Genevieve massaged her temples, the mere mention of Lucien sending a sharp pain through her skull. She had been careless, too trusting.

She had believed Lucien was brilliant, a prodigy in his field.

After all, he had won prestigious awards.

But those accolades had been built on lies—plagiarism and scandal.

"He tricked you too?"

Dominic's eyes widened in shock, his gaze lingering on Genevieve a little too long. She bristled under his scrutiny, shooting him a sharp glare.

"What exactly are you implying? I had no idea what kind of man he was. I was fooled just like you."

"Oh..."

Dominic exhaled in relief, but his expression only irritated Genevieve further.

"Honestly, what goes through that head of yours?"

"I—I just wanted to prove myself to you, to make you proud. But instead, I've ruined everything," he muttered, his voice thick with regret.

Genevieve's stern expression softened slightly.

Despite everything, guilt still gnawed at her. She had been absent for too much of his life.

"It's not the end of the world. Things could be worse. At least we still have options." She paused, then arched a brow. "Speaking of which, I heard you've been trying to win Evelyn back?"

Dominic's face darkened at the mention.

"Not going well, I take it?"

Genevieve gave him a sidelong glance. She wasn't surprised.

"Honestly, did you expect her to just forgive you? After how you treated her? The Hawthornes probably still despise you. You need to be patient."

"Patient?" Dominic scoffed. "Mom, it doesn't matter how patient I am—she's already with someone else!"

Genevieve froze.

"Who? I haven't heard anything about this."

Dominic clenched his fists, the name bitter on his tongue.

"Alexander Kensington."

Just saying it aloud made his stomach twist. The man was untouchable.

"Who?"

Genevieve's sharp exclamation didn't surprise him.

"You heard me. Alexander Kensington—CEO of Celestia Group, head of the Kensington family."

Silence.

Genevieve stared at him, stunned.

After a long pause, she finally regained her composure.

"Where did you hear this?"

Rumors spread like wildfire these days. People lied for protection, for advantage—for any reason at all.

Genevieve wasn’t about to take Dominic’s word for it.

Dominic’s jaw tightened.

"I saw it with my own eyes."

His voice was hollow, the words tasting like ash.
###Chapter 413

"You saw it?"

Genevieve trailed off, frowning because she found it hard to believe Dominic's words.

"Alexander Kensington? The CEO of Celestia Group?"

Genevieve knew about Alexander.

In fact, the Kensington family was well known, not only in Veridian City but in the entire nation of Veridia as well.

Alexander was widely regarded as the most talented heir to the family and the object of admiration for countless women across the country.

Why would such a man be in a relationship with Evelyn? It wasn’t entirely impossible, though, after Genevieve gave it some thought.

If Evelyn were any other woman, Genevieve might have convinced herself that she was just one of Alexander’s fleeting affairs.

But Evelyn was part of the Hawthorne family. If Alexander and Evelyn married, their union would unite the Kensington and Hawthorne families—a merger with far-reaching consequences.

"Mom, I don’t think Evelyn has feelings for me anymore. Anything I do would be pointless. What should I do now?"

Dominic looked defeated. He knew he stood no chance against Alexander, not when his rival was a man of that caliber. His resigned attitude only irritated Genevieve further.

"What should you do? Are you seriously asking me that now? I’ve warned you countless times to treat her right! Now that she’s moved on, you’re suddenly full of regrets?"

"I—I was just blinded back then..."

Dominic admitted his mistake, but dwelling on it now was useless.

Genevieve understood that too. She sighed after a brief scolding.

"Forget it! She’s not the only woman in the world. You have plenty of other options. But let me make this clear—next time, you can date whoever you want, but be smart about it! Women like Vanessa are for fun, not marriage!"

In the past, Dominic would have argued, but after everything that had happened, he knew better.

Nodding, he said, "You’re right, Mom. I’ll listen to you next time. But what do I do now?"

Though he wanted to prove himself, he knew Genevieve was far more perceptive and strategic. He had no idea how to handle this situation, so he had no choice but to rely on her.

"You need to pull those two new perfumes from the market," Genevieve said after a moment.

"What?"

That would be a massive blow to DR Holdings. Those two perfumes were their primary source of revenue.

"Is that all you can say? Do you want to watch your company collapse? If so, then ignore my advice!"

Dominic quickly grabbed her arm.

"No! Mom, please. I said I’d listen. But if we stop selling those two, we’ll only have outdated products left. We’ll never expand our market share like that!"

Genevieve scoffed. "Expanding? Right now, you should be focused on keeping what you have!"

She paused before continuing, "Besides removing those perfumes, you need to issue a public statement immediately. Hire the best PR team—make sure the wording is flawless. That’s step one."

"First, apologize to consumers. Say your company was deceived. Emphasize your principles—that DR Holdings refuses to work with unethical perfumers. Promise a new, superior product line soon."

"Finally, express sympathy for what happened to Vanessa. Make it clear you’re committed to quality. Oh, and don’t forget to mention you two broke up months ago."

"That’s personal. Do I really have to bring it up?" Dominic hesitated.
###Chapter 414

Genevieve raised her hand as if to smack Dominic's head, exasperated by his lack of foresight.

"You're the legal representative of DR Holdings. Your position in this scandal is critical!"

Her voice sharpened. "There's no escaping your involvement now. No matter what you do, you're trapped."

"If you publicly stand by Vanessa, people will question your integrity. If you abandon her, they'll call you heartless for turning your back when she needed you most."

Dominic's face darkened.

"So I lose either way?"

"Exactly!"

Genevieve's patience frayed. "This mess is entirely your fault! The situation should have been handled discreetly, but you couldn't keep your mouth shut. The more you say, the worse it gets."

She jabbed a finger at him. "And stay out of the clubs. No more drunken scandals. Do you want to ruin yourself completely?"

Dominic ducked his head, shame burning his cheeks. "I—I'm sorry."

Genevieve exhaled sharply. "You need to position yourself as the victim. Didn’t you claim Vanessa was involved with Lucien? Leak that through online trolls—not yourself. Stay silent publicly. Let the narrative paint you as the wronged party."

Dominic jerked his head up, horrified. "You want me to air our dirty laundry for the world?"

The idea repulsed him. His pride recoiled at the thought of public humiliation.

Genevieve scoffed. "What matters more—your pride or your career?"

Sometimes, she wondered if he’d inherited any of her strategic mind.

"People pity the vulnerable. If you say nothing, they’ll assume the worst about Vanessa and sympathize with you. Sympathy is power—use it."

Understanding dawned in Dominic’s eyes. "I... see."

Under her guidance, the path forward became clear.

"Thank you, Mother." His voice softened. "I didn’t think you’d... care enough to help."

Genevieve sighed. "You’re still my son. I won’t watch you drown."

She straightened, shifting focus. "Beyond damage control, you need skilled perfumers. DR Holdings can’t survive without talent. My advice may save you now, but what about next time?"

Dominic grimaced. "I’ve tried recruiting, but top-tier perfumers won’t join us. The novices aren’t good enough."

"Stop aiming for perfection," Genevieve snapped. "Hire mid-tier candidates with potential. Raw talent matters more than experience. Understood?"

Dominic opened his mouth to argue, then caught her warning glare.

"...Fine."

He had no room for pride anymore. Right now, competence—any competence—would have to suffice.
###Chapter 415

Dominic acted swiftly, mobilizing his crisis management team to issue a formal statement the next morning while simultaneously delivering his apology to the board members. With practiced humility, he acknowledged his oversight in team supervision.

He presented a compelling case to the directors, illustrating how DR Holdings would face catastrophic losses if they didn't immediately recall Vanessa's two fragrance lines. His fingers tapped rhythmically against the mahogany conference table as he spoke.

To mitigate the financial damage, Dominic pledged to introduce an innovative new product line within the quarter. The board members exchanged uneasy glances, their dissatisfaction palpable in the tense atmosphere.

Yet they recognized the grim reality - they were trapped in Dominic's chess game. His earnest apology and calculated vulnerability made them hesitate to pull their investments entirely.

After heated deliberation, the board reluctantly approved Dominic's proposal, granting him this final opportunity to redeem himself. None could devise a superior alternative.

Dominic exhaled sharply when the vote passed, knowing he'd cleared the first hurdle. The PR team's preemptive public apology had worked exactly as planned, painting DR Holdings as the victim in this scandal.

Unexpectedly, the discontinued perfumes gained cult status overnight. Speculators began reselling them at exorbitant prices, capitalizing on their sudden rarity. Dominic watched this development with mixed emotions.

Genevieve's warning echoed in his mind - reintroducing the recalled products would destroy consumer trust irrevocably. He clenched his fists, resisting the tempting but dangerous shortcut.

The public sympathy campaign took an unexpected turn when Evelyn's name resurfaced in online discussions. Netizens spun elaborate narratives about Dominic's tragic romantic history, portraying him as a perpetual victim of love.

This narrative fueled an unprecedented surge in sales of DR Holdings' other fragrances. Factories scrambled to meet demand, operating around the clock. Dominic couldn't wait to share this triumph with his mother.

"You were right, Mother," he said during their nightly call. "The strategy worked perfectly. We're not just surviving - we're thriving."

Meanwhile, across town, Evelyn scrolled through social media with growing fury. Her tablet screen reflected the angry flush creeping up her neck. Why did complete strangers insist on dragging her into this manufactured drama?

With a frustrated growl, she hurled the device onto the plush sofa just as Alexander emerged from his study. The Kensington heir raised an eyebrow at the unusual display of temper from his typically composed wife.

Alexander retrieved the abandoned tablet, his sharp eyes quickly deciphering the source of her irritation. "From a purely strategic standpoint," he observed, "Dominic played this masterfully. Leveraging public sympathy while appearing vulnerable - it's textbook crisis management."

Evelyn crossed her arms, her emerald eyes flashing. "It's manipulative and dishonest," she countered. "He's rewriting history to suit his narrative."

Alexander settled beside her, his calm demeanor contrasting with her agitation. "Perhaps," he conceded. "But in the corporate world, perception often outweighs truth. Dominic understands that better than most."

The tension in Evelyn's shoulders didn't ease. She knew Alexander was right - which only infuriated her more. Somewhere in the city, Dominic was undoubtedly celebrating his pyrrhic victory while others paid the price for his schemes.
###Chapter 416

"Everything works out perfectly for him, while I'm the one suffering all the backlash!"

Evelyn fumed, her fingers tightening around her phone.

Amid the sea of online vitriol, she spotted a handful of netizens attempting to defend her. They argued that Dominic was merely playing the victim card for sympathy.

One particularly insightful comment dissected the entire fallout between her and DR Holdings with startling accuracy.

Evelyn didn’t recognize the username, but their analysis hit uncomfortably close to the truth.

Yet, their voice was drowned out by the overwhelming tide of public opinion.

Other users quickly branded the commentator as a troll, some even demanding they delete their post since Evelyn herself hadn’t spoken up.

"You want revenge?"

Alexander’s deep voice rumbled beside her as he set his tablet aside.

"Absolutely! He can wallow in his fake grief all he wants, but dragging my name through the mud? That’s crossing the line."

Evelyn’s cheeks flushed with indignation.

"And those few who defended me—they deserve justice too."

Alexander settled beside her, his tone deceptively casual. "Easy enough."

"I don’t need your help with this."

Evelyn pressed his hand firmly into the couch cushions. "I’ve got it handled."

Alexander sighed, glancing at his trapped hand.

"At this rate, what’s left for me to do? If you don’t need me, why keep me around?"

"You’re not useless."

Evelyn burrowed into his chest, her voice muffled against his shirt.

"You’re my personal heater on cold nights. My human blanket. My favorite pillow. See? Irreplaceable."

A low chuckle vibrated through his chest as he wrapped his arms around her.

"Still sure you don’t need my help?"

Evelyn’s smile faltered slightly before she shook her head.

"This might look complicated, but it’s simple. An eye for an eye—that’s all it takes."

Dominic had weaponized public sympathy, painting himself as the heartbroken victim while she focused on launching her new product line.

He’d even quietly settled their lawsuit behind closed doors.

But Evelyn had evidence—enough to turn the tables and expose the truth.

Alexander studied her determined expression before nodding silently. He trusted her to handle this her way.

Meanwhile, Dominic was in high spirits, overseeing DR Holdings’ latest recruitment drive.

His HR department had just posted a call for talented perfumers—regardless of experience—sparking a frenzy online.

With Dominic currently trending, applicants flooded in.

From his office, he watched the live feed of interviews, a satisfied smirk playing on his lips.

Everything was falling perfectly into place.
###Chapter 417

Just when Dominic Reeves believed he had successfully reversed public opinion and was heading toward redemption, a viral video surfaced online, shattering his carefully constructed image.

An anonymous account uploaded the footage with the provocative caption: "I might have believed in true love... if only I hadn't witnessed this moment myself."

The video revealed Dominic standing outside Phoenix Labs' headquarters, clutching an extravagant bouquet of 99 blood-red roses. As the camera rolled, dozens of heart-shaped balloons ascended into the sky, each trailing satin ribbons bearing the embossed words: "Evelyn Carter, I'm yours forever."

Evelyn had strategically released this damning evidence. Multiple angles existed—security footage, bystander recordings—all showing the same humiliating spectacle. She'd refused to play dirty before, but since Dominic adored public spectacles, she'd give him one he'd never forget.

Dominic initially dismissed the video's impact. He even preened at the thought of his grand romantic gesture going viral. But as views skyrocketed, the ominous caption gnawed at him. "If only I hadn't witnessed this moment myself"—what hidden meaning lurked beneath those words?

Internet sleuths quickly pinpointed the location: Phoenix Labs' corporate headquarters. The timestamp on the balloons' ascent placed the incident mere days after Vanessa Blake's scandal broke.

Public sentiment shifted like quicksand. Comments flooded in:

"Wait—wasn't he supposedly heartbroken over Vanessa's downfall? Why was he love-bombing another woman during his 'grieving period'?"

"I defended this snake! The audacity to call Evelyn obsessive when he's the one staging these cringeworthy public displays!"

"Proof he was cheating all along! That 'poor wronged man' act makes me sick!"

Dominic watched helplessly as his reputation crumbled. How had one video undone months of careful image rehabilitation?

A handful of die-hard supporters attempted damage control:

"People move on! The breakup was amicable—why shouldn't he pursue happiness?"

"Deepfakes exist! This could be fabricated!"

But their voices drowned in the tidal wave of outrage. The court of public opinion had rendered its verdict: Dominic Reeves wasn't a tragic hero—he was the villain in Evelyn's story.
###Chapter 418

"Evelyn isn't even commenting on this. Why are you all making such a big deal out of it?"

Their arguments fell flat when netizens began flooding social media with their own footage of the incident, proving the authenticity of the original video.

Some even urged skeptics to visit the DR Holdings office building themselves—there were plenty of witnesses that day.

The humiliating truth was out: Dominic Reeves had been escorted away by authorities, and the internet wasted no time mocking him for it.

Dominic was furious but assumed some random troll was behind the backlash—he hadn’t seen Evelyn’s response yet.

So, he reposted the video with a bold caption: "Love knows no fear."

After agonizing over it, he convinced himself it sounded cool.

What’s the problem? I broke up with Vanessa before pursuing Evelyn. I have nothing to hide. Mom always said winning people over starts with proving you’ve done nothing wrong. Strategy is everything.

Less than an hour later, a verified account quoted his post with a scathing reply: "The audacity!"

Dominic nearly lost it.

When he checked the profile, his blood boiled—it was Sophia Grant, using her real name. Her bio read: "Former research assistant at DR Holdings. Current researcher at Phoenix Labs."

Sophia had built a following of several hundred thousand by sharing beauty tips in her spare time, making her a rising influencer.

Her unique position in the industry gave her the platform to ignite this firestorm.

What started as niche perfume industry gossip quickly exploded into a full-blown scandal.

Dominic’s follower count skyrocketed—but most were just there to watch the drama unfold or to trash him in the comments.

Sophia’s accusations were razor-sharp, as if she were lecturing him face-to-face.

People demanded answers, sensing there was more to the story.

Fuming, Dominic called Sophia immediately. To his surprise, she answered.

No pleasantries. Just rage.

"Sophia Grant! What the hell is this? Explain yourself—now!"

Her voice was ice. "It’s exactly what it looks like."

"What did I even do to you? You wanted to leave DR Holdings, and I let you go. You caused problems after quitting, and I still let it slide. Did I shortchange you? Did I owe you money? Tell me!"

Then it hit him.

"Was this Evelyn’s idea? Did she put you up to this?"

Sophia scoffed. "You only let me go because Evelyn made a deal with you. She dropped the lawsuit over your stolen formulas in exchange for my freedom. And don’t pretend you didn’t threaten my mother when you showed up at our house!"

Dominic scoffed. "Afraid of a lawsuit? Please. And I visited your mother. Threatened her? Ask her yourself if you don’t believe me!"

"Save the act, Mr. Reeves. You, Vanessa, Evelyn—we all know the truth."

"So you are admitting Evelyn told you to do this."

Dominic yanked at his tie, loosening it with a bitter thought: I knew she was behind this.

"This is all me. I just couldn’t stand your shamelessness anymore."

She glanced at her phone, recording everything, then spoke slowly, deliberately.

"Let me ask you this: Do you have the guts to admit Evelyn created DR Holdings’ past perfumes? That she was your girlfriend while Vanessa was your mistress? That you were the one who cheated?"
###Chapter 419

"I..." Dominic nearly confessed, but a sudden realization stopped him.

"Why should I admit anything? I've never done those things. Evelyn, don't you dare twist the truth just because you have Sophia backing you now. I'm innocent, and I won't be intimidated!"

With that, he ended the call abruptly.

Thank God I caught myself in time. If she had been recording this, I'd be finished.

He exhaled sharply, pressing a hand to his chest, relief washing over him. He had dodged a bullet—no evidence, no confession.

Meanwhile, Evelyn clenched her fists in frustration. She had been so close.

One more sentence, one careless admission, and she would have had the recording she needed. Posting it online would have been the final nail in Dominic’s coffin.

But he had shut down at the critical moment, refusing to take the bait.

He’s too careful. Too calculated.

"I told you he wouldn’t fall for it so easily," Sophia said, unimpressed.

If Dominic were the type to slip up, he wouldn’t have deceived Evelyn for as long as he had. He was cunning—Sophia knew that better than anyone.

Evelyn groaned, tossing her phone onto the desk. "He’s such a coward! He did all of it but won’t own up to it!"

Sophia shrugged. "The world is full of people like him. If everyone admitted their crimes, we wouldn’t need detectives, would we?"

Since she hadn’t expected much from Evelyn’s tactic, the failure didn’t faze her.

"Did you organize the documents I gave you?" Sophia asked calmly.

Evelyn nodded, her mood lifting slightly. "Yes. Thank goodness we still have the records."

"Good. Post them now. Redact the sensitive parts, but make sure the dates and locations are clear."

Sophia scanned the materials one last time before giving the go-ahead.

She had been meticulous when she left DR Holdings.

Dominic thought he had stripped her of everything—her research, her data. But he didn’t know about her backups, tucked away in notebooks and encrypted files.

Evelyn, as her assistant, had her own set of records, documenting every experiment, every adjustment.

Together, their notes were undeniable proof.

The moment Evelyn hit post, the internet erupted.

Neutral bystanders, previously hesitant, now rallied behind Evelyn. The evidence was too solid, too detailed to dismiss.

Handwritten notes, corrections, trial logs—it was all there. No one could fake years of meticulous work overnight.

The backlash was immediate.

Hashtags like #PlagiarismExposed, #CorporateFraud, and #DominicReevesApologize trended within minutes.

Dominic’s reputation crumbled in real time.

"No! This isn’t how it was supposed to go!" he snarled, staring at the screen in disbelief.
###Chapter 420

Dominic's fingers trembled as beads of cold sweat formed on his forehead.

The glowing monitor screen reflected in his wide, unblinking eyes.

He never anticipated Evelyn would play such a masterstroke. That Sophia possessed the research records was equally shocking.

"This isn't over yet!"

Dominic shoved his chair back with such force it nearly toppled over.

A memory surfaced - during their previous lawsuit against Evelyn, he'd ordered Vanessa to recreate a set of research notes.

Those forged documents could now become his lifeline.

After frantically ransacking his office, he unearthed the counterfeit notebook from the depths of a filing cabinet.

He slammed it onto the desk, reaching for his phone to photograph the pages when realization struck like lightning.

A crucial detail came rushing back.

When Evelyn left Phoenix Labs, she'd deliberately planted errors in the research data.

Not obvious mistakes, but subtle inconsistencies that Vanessa had unknowingly replicated in her forgery.

If he published these notes now, the internet sleuths would undoubtedly uncover the discrepancies.

The backlash would be catastrophic.

Dominic ran shaking fingers through his hair, desperately searching for an angle.

His screen flashed with relentless notifications - his inbox overflowing with vitriolic messages.

He didn't need to read them to know their contents.

Condemnation. Ridicule. Threats.

The weight of public opinion pressed down like an invisible vise around his throat.

Ironically, all this fury existed in the digital realm.

A simple power button could make it all disappear.

Yet the psychological torment remained, inescapable and suffocating.

He understood better than most the terrifying power of modern cancel culture.

It could make careers... or destroy them overnight.

The mounting product return requests and boycott threats signaled impending disaster.

Drawing a shaky breath, Dominic resolved to try one last gambit.

He vaguely recalled Evelyn's masterful handling of her own scandal - a single, defiant post claiming innocence with effortless cool.

That nonchalant response had not only silenced critics but gained her legions of new admirers.

Dominic would attempt the same strategy.

Instead of disabling comments or blocking critics, he reposted Sophia's damning evidence with a single bold caption:

"I stand by my work. The truth will prevail."

His fingers hovered over the keyboard before pulling back.

Next, he speed-dialed the customer service director.

"Establish a dedicated returns hotline," he ordered, voice steadier than he felt. "Process refunds in chronological order - slow but deliberate. Approve some immediately to show good faith."

The manager protested, "Mr. Reeves, half these requests are from people who've already used the products! This is clearly malicious-"

"Doesn't matter," Dominic cut in. "Emphasize our commitment to customer satisfaction. Make them wait, but make them feel heard."

After issuing similar instructions to PR, Dominic strode to the floor-to-ceiling windows.

A fierce wind howled outside, its chill penetrating the glass.

This was his final gamble - betting on public sympathy, on the fickle nature of internet outrage.

'Evelyn,' he thought grimly, 'let's see whose luck holds out this time.'

The city lights blurred as night fell, mirroring the uncertainty in his stormy gaze.
###Chapter 421

The shifting public opinion proved Dominic had won his bet. The criticism against him had dwindled, and some netizens had even begun defending him.

"If Evelyn truly created DR Holdings' past products, why did she stay silent all this time? She only speaks up now, when the company is in crisis. She’s clearly just jealous! She wants to ruin Dominic because he didn’t return her feelings."

"Mr. Reeves stated he’s innocent and never wronged Evelyn or Vanessa, despite everything that’s happened. Whether he loved them or not, he ended things peacefully with both women. But look at Evelyn—she jumped straight to Phoenix Labs after leaving DR Holdings and immediately started causing trouble for her former employer. Whether Dominic was her ex or just someone she admired, this isn’t how you treat people. Honestly, she’s just petty."

Sophia monitored the situation closely, her frustration mounting. Beside her, Victoria shook her head in disbelief. "How can people be so blind? The evidence is right in front of them, yet they still side with that bastard. I’m starting to think he hired bots to sway public opinion."

"There will always be ignorant people," Evelyn replied calmly, her expression unreadable.

"And then there’s this gem—‘Your proof might be solid, but Dominic was someone you once loved. Can’t you show him a little mercy?’" Sophia read aloud before slamming her palm on the table. "What the hell?!"

Unlike Sophia’s fury, Victoria found the absurdity amusing. She laughed. "My team always said misplaced kindness exists, but I never believed it until now. Turns out, they’re all on Twitter!"

Evelyn chuckled. "Vic, I never knew you were this funny. You could do stand-up."

"Seriously? You two are joking around while I’m about to combust?" Sophia fumed. She had used her personal account to post all the evidence, unafraid of backlash. She wanted the truth out there.

Yet Dominic’s carefully crafted words had swayed the masses.

Innocent? The audacity.

"Getting angry over Dominic isn’t worth it," Evelyn said, wrapping her arms around Sophia from behind, her tone soothing. "It’ll just give you wrinkles. Relax. I’m not letting him off easy this time. We’re seeing this through to the end."

Sophia turned sharply. "You have more planned?"

"Patience," Evelyn said, her smile serene. "Let the public speculate while Dominic enjoys his little victory a while longer."

For the past two days, they had released damning evidence that humiliated Dominic. He had countered brilliantly—offering impeccable customer service, expedited refunds, and smooth-talking his way into public favor.

But Evelyn wasn’t done bursting his bubble.

"We’re done for today. Let’s go home," she announced, stretching with a yawn.

Before she could leave, Victoria pushed her back into her seat. "Hold on. You’ve been clocking out on time lately instead of working late. Spill—are you hiding a man from us?"

Sophia hesitated, biting her tongue. Hiding a man? More like being hidden. That man of hers isn’t exactly low-profile.

"You caught me," Evelyn said, patting Victoria’s shoulder as she stood. "Now don’t keep me from my baby."

Victoria blinked, stunned by the admission.

Sophia could only sigh.

"Has Evelyn been… acting weird lately?" Victoria gestured vaguely.

Sophia shrugged.

Recently, Evelyn had bought a new car—a sleek red Porsche, understated but efficient. It made getting around easier.

But as she headed to the parking lot, someone was already waiting for her.
###Chapter 422

Perhaps it was Evelyn's intuition. Even though the person remained inside their vehicle, she sensed something odd. Turning her head, she peered into the adjacent car and found Donovan Pierce seated in the back, his finger curling in a silent command for her to approach.

Her breath hitched, but she obeyed without protest, sliding into his car. After a brief glance at him, she averted her gaze toward her crimson Porsche and asked, "How did you recognize my car?"

"You've been making waves lately," Donovan remarked cryptically, sidestepping her question.

"Suppose so. I’m sure you’ve caught wind of everything." Evelyn nodded. If he had pinpointed her vehicle in this sprawling parking lot, she had no doubt he was well-informed about the recent uproar online.

"I don’t recall you being this… conspicuous before," Donovan mused, this time turning fully to study her.

"Maybe the Hawthorne influence rubbed off on me. Or perhaps I just fancied a change in style." Evelyn lowered her head, smoothing out the creases in her blouse before giving up with a frustrated tug. "You weren’t just passing by, were you? Did Grandfather send you?"

"Birthday celebration." The two words explained his presence succinctly.

Evelyn remembered the occasion and gave a slight nod. "Right. I knew that was why you were here. I’ll be there."

"Have you truly decided never to return?" Donovan’s gaze bore into her as if he could extract the truth from her expression alone.

"I’ve told you before—it’s not about refusing to go back. It’s just not the right time. Besides, does it even matter whether I step foot in that house again? Am I really that indispensable to the Hawthornes?" She scoffed.

Leaving the Hawthorne estate had been a relief—an escape from the suffocating tension and relentless expectations. She hadn’t once regretted it, not even when Dominic Reeves and Vanessa Blake had played their cruel games.

Using the Hawthorne name to retaliate would have been effortless, but the backlash would have been far worse. She preferred handling her battles alone rather than dragging herself back into their world.

Donovan’s expression darkened, his lips parting as if to argue, but he swallowed his words. Instead, he murmured, "He’s getting old."

"People in the Hawthorne bloodline live forever. Don’t worry about it." Evelyn patted his shoulder dismissively. "If that’s all, I’ll be on my way."

"Wait." Donovan stopped her, tossing a folder into her lap.

"What’s this?" She frowned.

"Information that might interest you. Look it over when you have time." His tone was casual, but his eyes held weight.

Evelyn arched a brow, weighing the folder in her hand. It was light—barely anything inside. Still, she tucked it under her arm. "Fine."

The moment she stepped out, the engine roared to life, and Donovan’s car vanished down the road. She glanced at the folder again, deciding she’d open it at home. No rush.
###Chapter 423

The Hawthorne mansion stood silent when Evelyn returned. Alexander's absence left the grand halls feeling colder than usual.

She slipped into something more comfortable after a long shower. The steaming mug of cocoa warmed her hands as she settled into the library's plush armchair.

The folder from Donovan Pierce felt heavier than its weight. She hadn't requested any information, which made its contents more intriguing. The first page revealed Dominic Reeves' name in bold letters.

Her breath caught. "What's this about him?"

The documents unfolded like a carefully constructed puzzle. Each page revealed another layer about Dominic's hidden past - particularly his complicated relationship with his mother.

Genevieve Sinclair's profile read like a society scandal waiting to happen. The award-winning actress turned Prescott matriarch had secrets that could topple empires. Most damning was the DNA evidence linking her to Dominic.

Evelyn's fingers trembled against the papers. All those years together, and Dominic had never mentioned having living family. She'd admired his resilience, believing him orphaned. This deception cut deeper than she expected.

Genevieve's name tickled her memory. The documents confirmed her suspicions - the former screen legend had married into the powerful Prescott family after leaving Hollywood. Not a whisper about her illegitimate son had ever surfaced.

Donovan had undersold this information. While damaging to Dominic, it would be catastrophic for Genevieve. The Prescott family valued reputation above all else.

The Prescotts of Garnet Springs were old money with tangled alliances. Genevieve had married the second son, Alistair Prescott - a man whose business relied on his wife's social connections. Their marriage was transactional at best.

If Alistair discovered Genevieve's secret son - and her continued contact with him - the fallout would be spectacular. The Prescott family didn't tolerate deception.

Evelyn studied the documents with growing unease. These weren't just papers - they were potential weapons. The kind of information ordinary investigators couldn't obtain. For the Hawthornes, it had been effortless.

"Why would Donovan give me this?" she murmured, tracing Dominic's name. The unspoken question hung heavier - what did he expect her to do with it?

After careful consideration, she slid the folder between rare first editions on the top shelf. A card up her sleeve didn't need playing... yet.

As she straightened the shelf, two wooden figurines caught her eye. The whimsical carvings brought an unexpected flush to her cheeks. She'd commissioned them as a birthday gift for Reginald Hawthorne, but the craftsman had vanished before completing the set.

Julian Mercer - the talented woodcarver - had disappeared without a trace. The small shop on Antiquarius Lane knew nothing of his whereabouts. Such transient workers came and went in that part of town.

Evelyn sighed, running a finger over the smooth mahogany. Without Julian, she'd lost both her carver and her source for the rare crimson mahogany she'd wanted to use. Some mysteries, it seemed, would remain unsolved.
###Chapter 424

She toyed with the wooden figurine between her fingers, exhaling softly before murmuring, "Tell me, where has that young man disappeared to?"

Across from her, the carved doll grinned back silently.

The moment Dominic stepped through his front door, he dialed Genevieve’s number. Two attempts. Both went straight to voicemail.

She must be occupied.

He didn’t dare try again.

Restlessness coiled in his chest like a caged beast. He booted up his laptop, fingers drumming against the desk as sales figures loaded. The numbers glared back—another decline.

Returns had slowed, but not enough. Not nearly enough.

His public statement was irreversible now. The only play left? Delay. Stall the refund process. Buy time to salvage what remained of DR Holdings’ reputation while quietly funneling resources into new product development.

Quality could wait. Speed was paramount.

Dominic spun his chair—once, twice, twenty-three times—before his phone finally vibrated. He snatched it up like a drowning man grasping at driftwood.

Genevieve Sinclair.

"Mom—"

"Silence." The hissed command crackled through the receiver, sharp enough to freeze his breath.

Dominic blinked. Then, correcting himself: "Ms. Sinclair."

"Have you forgotten yourself?" Her voice was a blade wrapped in velvet. "Since when do you call me directly? Since when do you ignore protocol?"

He swallowed. No defense came.

Their agreement had been clear: messages first. No familial titles. No risks.

Yet lately, Genevieve had softened—meetings over tea, advice whispered like secrets. He’d mistaken leniency for liberty.

"I… apologize." His grip tightened on the phone. "It won’t happen again."

A pause. Then, the ice in her tone thawed slightly. "Good. Now—explain this unease you mentioned."

Dominic exhaled. "It’s Evelyn. I think she’s biding her time. Waiting for me to slip up before she—"

"Evelyn?" Genevieve’s interruption was razor-edged. "Why is she involved? What did you do?"

The past forty-eight hours had been a whirlwind of damage control—board meetings, press leaks, frantic calls to investors. He’d assumed she knew.

But Genevieve’s sharp inhale told him otherwise.

"You’re trending," he said quietly. "And not in a way that benefits either of us."

A beat of silence. Then, colder than winter:

"Start from the beginning."
###Chapter 425

"About that..." He hesitated before continuing, "I didn't provoke her. She's the one who made this impossible for me. The court of public opinion has already ruled—sympathy won't change anything."

"Everyone believes Evelyn now. If product returns keep flooding in at this rate, DR Holdings is finished."

"You—" The fury nearly knocked the breath from her lungs. Genevieve Sinclair didn't respond immediately. Instead, the sharp click of heels echoed through the phone—she was searching for a private space. Once secured, her voice dropped to a venomous hiss. "She had nothing to do with the strategy I gave you! You know exactly who backs her, yet you still poke the bear? Are you actively trying to destroy yourself?"

"I told you—I didn't start this. She struck first. No matter how much I play the victim now, nobody will buy it!" Dominic Reeves sounded utterly defeated.

Genevieve scoffed. "Spare me the act. You're not a victim—you're a fool."

Dominic had no rebuttal.

"Enough," Genevieve snapped. "I'll look into the situation. Don't call unless it's critical." A pause. Then, colder: "Actually, don't call at all. I'm occupied. I'll reach out when I have time."

The line went dead. Dominic stared at his phone, the dial tone mocking him. The call had only deepened his despair—no solutions, just scathing judgment.

He couldn't stay passive. The internet had turned him into a spectacle.

The hottest debates revolved around two scandals: whether Evelyn Carter or Vanessa Blake was the true creator of DR Holdings' early perfumes, and whether Dominic and Vanessa had conspired to steal Evelyn's work.

The second burning topic? Whether Dominic had ever loved Evelyn—or if Vanessa was the other woman. Theories about his lies spread like wildfire.

Most issues stemmed from these two. Solve them, and the rest would crumble.

The love triangle was personal, but the perfume scandal was professional suicide. He'd brushed it off before, but now? The evidence was damning.

Dominic knew the truth. He just never expected Evelyn to have such irrefutable proof.

After agonizing deliberation, he decided honesty might be his only lifeline. Criminals who confessed got lighter sentences—maybe a public apology and self-flagellation would salvage his reputation.

The idea solidified. He couldn't wait for Genevieve—who knew when she'd bother with him again? Every second of inaction tightened the noose.

He lunged for his laptop, fingers flying over the keyboard. The document title glared back at him: "My Apology."

The next morning, Evelyn walked into her office and froze. A massive wooden crate sat on her chair, nailed shut with no visible seams.

"Whose is this?" she asked.

"Yours," a colleague chimed in. "Security delivered it at dawn. It's heavy—had to wheel it up."

Evelyn circled the box, frowning. No shipping label, no sender info—just her name scrawled in black marker:

Evelyn Carter.

It was addressed to her, but who would send something this enormous unannounced?

"Evelyn," someone called, "what's inside?"
###Chapter 426

"Come on, tell us! What's in there?"

"That's one massive piece of furniture!"

Curious colleagues swarmed around, some even pressing close to peer inside. But the wooden crate was sealed so tightly that all they could see were smooth, polished panels.

"I didn’t order this!" Evelyn shook her head, resting a hand on the box. "Did security mention anything else about the sender?"

Her coworkers exchanged glances before shrugging in unison. No one had a clue.

Tapping her fingers against the wooden frame, Evelyn's mind raced. Who could have sent this? And more importantly—how was she supposed to open it?

What if it was something dangerous?

The thought sent a chill down her spine. She yanked her hand back as if burned.

"Whoa, that’s enormous!" Bella rushed over, a half-eaten croissant in hand. "What’s inside?"

Evelyn shot her a dry look. "A bomb."

Bella shrieked and stumbled back, nearly dropping her pastry. "Seriously?!"

"Of course not." Evelyn rolled her eyes. "If it were, we wouldn’t still be standing here."

One of the nearby colleagues chuckled. "We’re all dying to know! Evelyn, if you didn’t buy it, it’s gotta be from a secret admirer. Maybe your boyfriend?"

The teasing remark made Evelyn pause. Could Alexander have sent this?

She excused herself, stepping into a quiet corner to call him. The line connected after a few rings, his smooth voice instantly calming her nerves. "Miss me already?"

"Did you send me something?" she asked.

Alexander hesitated. "A gift? What kind of gift?"

Her stomach dropped. "So… it wasn’t you?"

"Wait, someone sent you something?" His tone sharpened. "What is it? Flowers? Balloons?" The last word came out strained—understandable, given their history.

"No, nothing like that. Just… a giant wooden crate. Sealed shut."

Silence. Then, cautiously, "Don’t open it yet. Move it somewhere open first."

Evelyn snorted. "You think it’s a bomb? If it were, we’d already be in pieces. And there’s no ticking."

"Doesn’t matter. Better safe than sorry."

She sighed. "Fine. I’ll be careful."

But as she hung up, her fingers tightened around her phone.

If not Alexander… then who?
###Chapter 427

"Oh, I see. Don't worry. Everything will be fine."

After ending the call, Evelyn Carter stared anxiously at the massive wooden crate in front of her. She had no idea how the security guard had managed to haul it up here. The box was so large that she could barely wrap her arms around it.

Alexander Kensington had instructed her to have it moved to a more spacious area—but who was she supposed to ask for help?

Just as Evelyn was stressing over the dilemma, Sophia Grant, standing beside her, lit up with excitement. Sophia had already finished breakfast and tidied up before coming over. Noticing Evelyn's hesitation, she approached and asked, "Why haven't you opened it yet?"

"I'm afraid it might be some kind of prank." Evelyn turned to Sophia helplessly. "Besides, how am I supposed to dismantle this thing?"

"It shouldn't be too hard. You'll need pliers and a screwdriver!" Sophia sounded confident, as if she had experience with this sort of thing.

"Then you do it!" Evelyn seized the opportunity to pass the task to her.

Sophia rolled up her sleeves, ready to tackle the crate—then abruptly paused and grinned. "Actually, I only know the theory. I’ve never done this before. Maybe we should call a professional."

That wasn’t a bad idea.

In the end, Evelyn hired a handyman who arrived with a toolkit. After inspecting the crate, he declared, "Piece of cake!"

With a few swift movements, he pried open the wooden box. Everyone in the room held their breath, anticipation thick in the air. No one knew what was inside—curiosity and apprehension warred within them.

But when the lid finally came off, a collective gasp filled the room.

It wasn’t a prank.

Inside was an exquisitely carved wooden crane, its wings outstretched in mid-flight. The sculpture stood on one leg, the other gracefully tucked, as if poised to take off at any moment.

The natural grain of the wood had been preserved, its rich tones enhancing the lifelike details. Every curve and contour was masterfully executed, giving the crane an almost ethereal presence. Even at a glance, it was clear—this was the work of a true artisan.

"Wow, what is this?" Victoria Sterling, who had just arrived for a meeting, froze in the doorway, stunned by the sight of the massive sculpture.

"Vicky!" Sophia hurried over, beaming. "Someone sent this to Evelyn as a gift! Isn’t it stunning?"

"A gift?" Victoria circled the crane twice, her eyes wide. "This isn’t just a gift—it’s a masterpiece."

Then, remembering Dominic Reeves’ grand balloon confession stunt, she smirked. "Did he send this?"

Evelyn flinched at the directness and shook her head.

Though initially shocked, she had quickly realized who the sender was. No name, no note—but she didn’t need one.

The wood, the craftsmanship—there was only one person who could have created this.

He didn’t disappear after all. Maybe he never left the country. Maybe he’s still nearby. Otherwise, how could he have arranged for this to be delivered?

Evelyn had mentioned wanting a meaningful sculpture for her grandfather’s birthday, but she hadn’t known what it would look like. Fragrances? She could design those in her sleep. But sculptures? Her mind went blank.

She’d had only a vague idea of what she wanted—certainly nothing as breathtaking as this.

Her original plan had been to collaborate with the young carver, refining the design as he worked. But he had vanished before they could begin.

Yet here it was—finished, flawless, and far beyond anything she had imagined.

He had taken her request seriously.

More seriously than she ever expected.
###Chapter 428

"If this isn't from that jerk Dominic, then..." Evelyn smirked meaningfully at Sophia.

She was the only one who knew the truth about Evelyn's mysterious boyfriend. Evelyn considered denying it but hesitated. If she kept refusing to acknowledge it, the others would only grow more curious—more interested in the man than the gift itself. She didn’t want endless questions, so she gave a vague response.

"Yeah."

"Wow, her boyfriend has serious creativity!"

"Right? I’ve seen flowers, chocolates, makeup, designer bags—but a hand-carved wooden sculpture? That’s a first."

"Shouldn’t he be gifting rare perfumes or essential oils instead? Something Evelyn would actually use?"

The office buzzed with chatter until Victoria cleared her throat sharply.

"Why don’t I see this much enthusiasm during meetings?"

The reminder snapped everyone back to reality. Work hours. Office rules. The gossip died instantly, replaced by the clatter of keyboards.

Victoria glanced around before turning to Evelyn.

"Why don’t..." She hesitated. "Why don’t you keep it in my office for now? You can take it home after work."

Evelyn considered it, then nodded. "Fine."

Unpacked, the sculpture was easier to move. The crane’s delicate wings required careful handling, but the real bulk had been the protective frame and padding. Thankfully, the movers hadn’t damaged it.

She placed it in the corner of Victoria’s office. The craftsmanship was breathtaking—so lifelike it almost seemed ready to take flight.

Victoria couldn’t stop staring.

"Ask your boyfriend where he got this. I want one."

Evelyn stayed silent.

"What, is it a secret? I won’t copy yours. I’ll get a different design." Victoria nudged her playfully. "Unless he only makes them for you?"

"I’ll ask him later."

The truth was, she had no idea how to contact him. He’d sent the gift without a word. And given his temperament, he might refuse commissions altogether.

A knock interrupted them.

"Ms. Sterling?" Sophia stood at the door, eyes wide.

Victoria waved her in. "What is it?"

Sophia locked eyes with Evelyn. "Dominic just issued a public apology."

"What?!" Evelyn froze, certain she’d misheard.

"He apologized?" Victoria’s fingers flew to her keyboard.

Sure enough, Dominic’s statement was already trending—a lengthy, carefully worded post that had gone viral within minutes.

"He admitted it?" Victoria’s brows shot up.

The three women exchanged glances, then huddled around the screen to read.
###Chapter 429

The trio froze as they read the apology post.

This wasn’t an apology—it was a masterclass in deflection.

Dominic Reeves had penned an entire essay, but Evelyn Carter, Sophia Grant, and Victoria Sterling could distill it down to one thing:

He was playing the victim.

First, Dominic claimed he had spent days meticulously reviewing the records, finally confirming that the previous products were Evelyn’s work, not Vanessa Blake’s.

The misunderstanding, he insisted, was due to Vanessa’s deception. He had been fooled, just like everyone else. Now that he knew the truth, he was consumed with regret and wanted to apologize to Evelyn.

Second, he declared that his relationships with Vanessa and Evelyn were personal matters, not for public discussion. But since people were so invested, he felt compelled to clarify—he had no regrets because he had been in love.

The entire post dripped with false sincerity. He ended it by vowing to accept any consequences Evelyn demanded, claiming he owed her and would do whatever she asked to make amends.

The public might swallow his words, but the trio saw right through them.

"Unbelievable," Sophia spat, slamming her phone down.

"I have to hand it to him," Victoria mused, shaking her head. "The man knows how to spin a story."

"Admire him? He’s a lying snake!" Sophia snapped.

"Oh, absolutely," Victoria agreed. "But he’s a skilled one. He knows when to retreat, when to play weak, and how to twist truth with lies so seamlessly that no one can untangle them."

Evelyn nodded. Victoria was right.

Dominic couldn’t hide the truth anymore, so he buried it in half-truths. He painted himself as another victim—blaming Vanessa, who was conveniently locked away and couldn’t defend herself.

"I’m exposing this," Sophia declared, already reaching for her laptop. "People need to know what a fraud he is."

Evelyn stopped her with a hand on her wrist. "And say what? That he did know? Who’s going to believe us over him? Vanessa’s in prison—she can’t confirm or deny anything. He chose his scapegoat carefully."

Sophia clenched her fists. "So we just let him get away with this?"

"For now," Evelyn said calmly.

Sophia groaned. "Again with the waiting?"

Evelyn smirked. "Patience, Sophia. You’ve worked with me long enough to know—rushing ruins the process. If I strike, it has to be decisive. No room for him to squirm free."

Sophia exhaled sharply, then mimed zipping her lips. "Fine. I’ll pretend I didn’t see a thing."

But the fire in her eyes said otherwise.
###Chapter 430

Evelyn turned around, her gaze lingering on the intricately carved wooden crane sculpture.

"You can think of this as a short break. The next project is about to begin, so you won’t have much time to rest."

"We have a new project?" Sophia perked up, excitement flashing in her eyes. She hadn’t worked in weeks, and her fingers practically itched for action. Even though working at DR Holdings could be exhausting, the satisfaction it brought was unmatched.

"Very soon!"

Alexander Kensington froze the moment he stepped into the living room. His sharp eyes immediately landed on the wooden crane sculpture, standing prominently in the center of the space.

It was impossible to miss.

"Is this…?" His voice trailed off, hesitant.

Evelyn had just finished clearing a spot for it when she noticed his return. She gestured toward him. "Perfect timing. Help me move this."

"Do you really need help with something this small?" He shrugged off his coat, rolled up his sleeves, and motioned for her to step aside. With effortless strength, he lifted the sculpture and placed it exactly where she had intended.

"Did you buy this?"

"Someone gifted it to me." She shook her head, studying the craftsmanship with admiration.

The details were exquisite—smooth lines, lifelike posture, even the crane’s eyes held a mesmerizing charm. She couldn’t help but smile as she examined it.

"Is this what you mentioned on the phone earlier?" Alexander pointed at it, eyebrows raised.

He had assumed it was some kind of joke, but this was far more impressive. Still, sending something like this to a woman? Whoever it was had an unusual sense of taste.

"Yeah." She rested her chin on her hand, nodding absently.

A flicker of irritation crossed Alexander’s face when he noticed her thoughtful expression. His voice dropped slightly. "A man?"

"Yeah." She nodded again, still distracted.

Her mind was elsewhere. If Julian Prescott had sent this, did that mean he wasn’t completely gone? Would he reappear?

Alexander abruptly rolled his sleeves higher, turned, and grabbed the sculpture again.

Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts. "Hey! What are you doing?"

"Throwing it out." His tone was firm.

"No! I want to give it to someone!" She grabbed his arm, holding him back. She knew that stubborn look—he wasn’t joking.

"Give it to someone? Who?" His suspicion deepened.

Evelyn sighed, amused by his protectiveness. "An elderly person, okay?"

"An elderly person…" He glanced back at the crane. It did have a serene, almost angelic quality—fitting for an older recipient. His tension eased slightly. "Who? You’ve never mentioned them before."

At that, Evelyn’s expression darkened, a shadow passing over her features.
###Chapter 431

Alexander noticed the subtle shift in Evelyn's expression and instantly recognized it as a delicate subject.

"You don't have to share if it's uncomfortable," he said gently.

Evelyn appreciated his sensitivity. Over the past few days they'd spent together, his thoughtfulness had slowly chipped away at her defenses.

Now that she reflected on it, Dominic had never opened up about his past either.

Despite their years together, there had been no real connection between them—just secrets and walls. No wonder things had ended the way they did.

"I've never told you about my family," Evelyn murmured, guiding him to the sofa with a soft touch.

Alexander quieted, taking her hand in his. He gave a slight nod. "No, you haven't."

"I was born in Elmsworth," she began carefully. "I'm from the Hawthorne family."

"The Hawthornes?"

"Yes."

The name carried weight, just like the Kensingtons of Veridian City, the Prescotts of Garnet Springs, and the Worthingtons from the capital.

Though the Hawthornes maintained a low profile, they were legendary for their ancient martial arts heritage. Unlike the other prominent families, little was known about them beyond their public figures.

That was why Alexander hadn't realized Evelyn was connected to them.

"Reginald Hawthorne is my grandfather," she explained, meeting his gaze. "That's why I don't carry the Hawthorne name."

The words felt heavy, like a confession she'd held back for years.

Once, she had been Evelyn Hawthorne. But at eighteen, she left for college, determined to forge her own path. When she chose perfumery—and Dominic—over family expectations, the rift between them deepened.

Dominic hadn't just been her lover. He had been her escape.

For years, the Hawthornes acted as if she no longer existed.

But she knew better. Blood ties couldn't be severed so easily.

And now, Donovan Pierce had reappeared, stirring something inside her—a dormant power awakening.

Alexander pieced it together quickly. "So this crane is for your grandfather?"

He knew Reginald's seventieth birthday was approaching. As a family ally, he had already prepared a gift. But he never imagined his wife was a Hawthorne.

"Yes," Evelyn confirmed, glancing at the delicate wooden sculpture. "Remember those twin dolls?"

"The ones that made you want twins?" he teased.

She shot him a look before continuing, "I wanted to commission a special piece from the woodcarver for Grandfather's birthday. But Julian Mercer vanished before I could ask. I never expected him to finish it and send it to me."

"Julian?"

Though the point of her story was the mysterious delivery, Alexander zeroed in on one detail.

A young man.

Evelyn sighed, ruffling his hair playfully. "Yes, he's young—about my brother's age. That's all."

This man. So possessive. Did he really see every male as competition?
###Chapter 432

"I didn't say a word!" Alexander huffed, his chin tilted in that infuriatingly arrogant way he had.

Evelyn sighed, massaging her temples. "Even with the birthday gift ready, I still don't know how to get it to him." Just thinking about it made her head throb.

"Aren't you going back?" Alexander asked, studying her. From her tone, it didn't sound like she planned to deliver it personally.

She shook her head, another sigh escaping her lips. "I hadn't considered that option."

"Why not?" He paused, then pressed further. "Is there someone there you're avoiding? Or something else? What about your parents?"

Alexander had never heard Evelyn speak of her family. When he'd investigated her background, there'd been no records—she'd erased herself completely.

"They're gone," she said evenly. "A plane crash took them both." The clinical way she said it unsettled him. How could she speak of such tragedy without flinching?

Without thinking, he pulled her into his arms. "That's behind you now. You have me."

She melted against him, her voice muffled against his chest. "You're right. I do."

Sometimes Evelyn wondered why she'd fallen for him so fast—why she trusted him implicitly when she'd never trusted anyone before. Was it the unshakable safety he gave her? The way his presence quieted the chaos in her mind?

She hadn't felt this anchored in years, not even during her time with the Hawthornes.

"If you don't want to go, I'll have someone deliver it," Alexander murmured. "But if you'd rather go and just need support... I'll be right beside you."

Evelyn jerked back to stare at him.

He chuckled, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. His gaze was impossibly soft, dissolving her tension with just a look.

"The Kensingtons and Hawthornes have always been allies," he explained. "I'd send a gift for Reginald's birthday regardless. Though I never expected..."

He squeezed her hand. "Point is—if you're not ready, our gifts can arrive together. That announces us as a couple neatly enough. But if you want to face them? I'll be your shield."

His fingers tightened around hers. "Wherever you go, Evelyn, I'm with you."

Suddenly, nothing seemed frightening. She leaned up, brushing her lips against his cheek. "I don't deserve you."

"That's not nearly enough," Alexander growled, capturing her mouth in a searing kiss.

Across town, Dominic finally exhaled.

Evelyn had stayed silent all day. Online sentiment was shifting, return rates stabilizing. His rebranding of the failed product as "Eternal Legacy" was gaining traction ahead of next week's relaunch.

It seemed fate demanded he salvage this mess alone.

Not that he'd slept much trying.
###Chapter 433

Dominic Reeves' world was crumbling.

He had envisioned soaring sales and skyrocketing profits. Instead, he was met with bullets—one after another, each more devastating than the last.

At 9:00 AM, a verified account with a massive following dropped three explosive videos.

The first was an old financial interview. Dominic, brimming with confidence, boasted about his perfume empire. He spoke passionately about the industry’s potential, lamenting the lack of elite perfumers in Veridia.

He promised to personally oversee every new fragrance development, vowing to work closely with perfumers who brought him innovative ideas.

His words dripped with ambition.

The second video was DR Holdings’ press conference—the day Evelyn Carter walked away.

The footage captured Dominic’s subtle panic when Evelyn refused to apologize. Vanessa Blake’s nervous glances and silent exchanges with him were crystal clear.

The camera work was impeccable. Every micro-expression, every hesitation—nothing escaped scrutiny.

The third video was the most humiliating. Authorities escorted Dominic from a lobby, his arms laden with 99 roses.

Attached was his apology letter, key phrases highlighted in glaring red.

He claimed ignorance. Deception. Betrayal.

He blamed Vanessa for everything, painting himself as a victim too consumed by business to notice her treachery.

The account posted no commentary.

It didn’t need to.

The internet erupted.

Dominic was drowning.

He didn’t remember half the things he’d said in those interviews. How could he? He’d given countless speeches, made endless promises—all hollow.

Whoever orchestrated this had patience. They waited, gathered evidence, and struck when he least expected it.

The contradictions were damning.

In one breath, he vowed to oversee production. In the next, he denied any involvement.

The public wasn’t stupid.

Then came the final blow.

At 10:30 AM, Phoenix Labs’ official website updated.

Certificates. Trophies. Awards.

Evelyn Carter had won first place in the International Perfumery Competition.

The industry rejoiced.

For years, Veridian perfumers had been mocked abroad. Evelyn changed that.

She didn’t just compete—she dominated.

Rumors spread that she’d turned down Harrison Whitaker’s offer to join his prestigious company.

Her name thundered through the industry like a storm.

This wasn’t a direct attack on Dominic.

But timing was everything.

An hour after his humiliation, Evelyn’s triumph shone brighter.

She wasn’t just exceptional in Veridia—she’d conquered the international stage.

And Vanessa Blake?

She paled in comparison.
###Chapter 434

Evelyn didn’t need to defend herself—she had already won the hearts of everyone.

Those who had doubted her stepped forward with sincere apologies, and the internet exploded with support for her.

Meanwhile, Dominic’s morning had been nothing short of a disaster. Just when he thought the storm had passed, another wave crashed over him.

As the workday neared its end, fresh headlines surfaced—this time questioning whether he and Evelyn had ever truly been together or if it had all been one-sided obsession.

The leaked video featured Dominic and Vanessa’s university classmates—some who barely knew Evelyn, others who had dismissed her quiet nature—all convinced that Dominic and Vanessa were the perfect couple.

But the narrative shifted abruptly.

The footage cut to an interview with their former professor, a respected academic who had mentored Evelyn.

Being Evelyn’s tutor was an honor, and he spoke candidly. The bombshell? He confirmed their relationship. Back then, Evelyn had been a scholar, and Dominic had relied on her for more than just academic help.

Later, when he recognized her talent in perfumery, he’d tried to recruit her for his own ambitions.

While their peers remained oblivious, the professor had witnessed Dominic picking Evelyn up after late-night lab sessions. His testimony was irrefutable.

People trusted professors—their reputations carried weight.

Classmates might lie for friends, but a professor? Never.

By now, Dominic’s credibility was in ruins. The internet had already branded him: Dominic Reeves is a fraud, a snake, and absolute trash.

He was dragged through the mud, left speechless in the wreckage of his own making.

In stark contrast, Evelyn was thriving. Sophia was practically ready to set off fireworks in celebration.

"Now I get it!" Sophia clinked her wine glass against Evelyn’s juice. "This is why you made me wait! It was worth every second!"

She couldn’t contain her joy. After biting her tongue for so long, watching Dominic’s downfall was sweeter than she ever imagined.

"Don’t overdo it," Evelyn chided lightly, shaking her head as she sipped her juice.

Sophia just laughed, the sound bright and unburdened. "Oh, let me enjoy this. We’ve earned it."

And for the first time in a long while, Evelyn allowed herself a small, satisfied smile.
###Chapter 435

Evelyn Carter had sworn off getting drunk ever since that wild night out with Victoria Sterling and Isabella Thornton. One embarrassing incident was enough. Now, she only sipped her drinks cautiously.

"Why aren’t you drinking? This is a celebration!" Isabella reached for Evelyn’s glass, her grin mischievous.

"Go ahead, have one! I’ll make sure you get home safe if you pass out."

"Hard pass," Evelyn shot back dryly. The last time Isabella had "sent her home," she’d barely stumbled through the door before nearly face-planting in the hallway. Thank God Alexander Kensington had been there to catch her.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "This time will be different! If I can’t get you inside, I’ll call reinforcements."

Victoria, who had been quietly observing, finally cut in. "Stop pressuring her. Drinking isn’t the point, anyway." She turned to Evelyn, curiosity gleaming in her eyes. "I’ve been wondering—why wait until now to drop all that evidence? You didn’t just gather it today, did you?"

Was it really just to let Dominic Reeves bask in false triumph before watching him crash and burn?

Evelyn took a slow sip of her juice, her expression unreadable. "I had the videos, but the competition results in Laurentia weren’t announced until now."

The realization hit the other two women at the same time. "You were waiting for the Westwood results!"

"Honestly, the competition wasn’t the main goal," Evelyn admitted. "But since I was already going to ruin Dominic, I figured I might as well do it thoroughly. Make sure he never recovers."

That was why she’d held back, gathering every scrap of proof before unleashing it all at once. By the time Dominic realized what was happening, it was too late. The flood of incriminating videos had already buried him.

Now, no amount of damage control could save him. No one would believe a word he said.

The best part? Evelyn had never engaged in the online drama. Her official Twitter account only posted product updates and company announcements. She never responded to the hate, never blocked anyone—even when the insults were relentless.

She’d stayed completely detached, focusing solely on her work.

At first, some had interpreted her silence as guilt. But now? Those same critics were tripping over themselves to apologize. Her fans, meanwhile, were singing her praises, boasting about how they’d always believed in her.

In the age of instant information, the truth spread like wildfire.

Just as Evelyn had predicted, Dominic was finished.

If this had only been about his personal scandals, he might have scraped by. But DR Holdings’ credibility was tangled up in the mess. Everyone now knew Evelyn had been the real creative force behind their past successes.

The company had stolen her work, then abandoned her. Yet, even after being wronged, Evelyn hadn’t dragged them through the mud. The contrast made her look even more dignified.

The fallout was brutal. DR Holdings’ return rates skyrocketed, while Phoenix Labs’ sales surged. People were buying her products just to show support. Stock was vanishing off shelves.

With the sudden influx of orders, Phoenix Labs was breaking records. Meanwhile, DR Holdings’ shareholders were fleeing, their criticism of Dominic relentless.

A CEO change wouldn’t fix this. The company’s reputation was in ruins.

Then came the final nail in the coffin—rumors that "DR Holdings" stood for Dominic and Vanessa. A public love declaration between two cheaters. The disgust was palpable.

For weeks, trash bins overflowed with discarded DR-labeled perfumes.

Dominic sat alone in his empty office, staring blankly at the wall.

This is it. I’m done.

Not even a miracle could save me now.
###Chapter 436

Dominic stared at his phone in confusion, fingers hovering over the call button. His mother's sharp warning echoed in his mind—"Don't call me!"

Of course. Genevieve Sinclair was a woman of relentless ambition. She had no time for his failures. Even if she answered, what could she do?

With a bitter exhale, he exited the call screen and typed a message instead: "I lost. Sorry. Goodbye."

A soft knock interrupted the silence. His secretary stood at the door, clutching a cardboard box.

"Mr. Reeves—"

Dominic waved her off weakly. "Go. Just… go."

He forced himself to stand, swaying slightly as he crossed the office. The floor-to-ceiling windows framed the city below—alive with glittering lights and endless motion. None of it was his anymore.

His mind drifted to the day he first stepped into this office. Back then, Phoenix Labs had been new, but Evelyn Carter's perfumes had taken the market by storm. Affordable yet luxurious, they flew off shelves. Investors lined up. Profits soared.

It had been like lightning in a bottle—just like Celestia Group's recent success.

Dominic had been unstoppable. Wealth. Influence. Power. He had Evelyn, devoted and brilliant, and Vanessa Blake, sweet and adoring in his arms.

He’d truly believed the future was his. That he could prove to Genevieve he didn’t need her. That he could claw his way into the elite circles on his own.

But when had it all unraveled? Where had he gone wrong?

His thoughts blurred. There was no fixing this. No second chances.

Game over.

Dominic staggered out of the bar hours later, drunk and unsteady. He barely made it a few steps before doubling over, retching against the alley wall. Still, he clung to the half-empty bottle. Alcohol was the only thing dulling the ache.

He took another swig, stumbling forward. Muttering.

Then—his foot caught on something.

He crashed to the pavement. Glass shattered. A sharp pain lanced through his palm, but he barely registered the blood. He just lay there, laughing hoarsely at the sky.

That was when the polished leather shoes appeared in his blurry vision.

Dominic squinted up at the shadowed figure.

"You…"
###Chapter 437

The chill deepened with each passing day until the first snowflakes began dancing through the night sky. Snow was a rare visitor in Veridian City—when it did appear, it barely dusted the tree branches before melting away, never given the chance to accumulate.

But as Evelyn Carter and Alexander Kensington traveled toward Elmsworth, the landscape transformed before their eyes. What had been mere icy drizzle in Veridian became proper snowfall the farther north they went. No longer just frozen droplets, but proper feathery flakes that blanketed everything in sight. By the time they reached the Hawthorne estate, the snowdrifts along the roadside reached past their ankles.

"Veridian and Elmsworth aren't that far apart geographically," Evelyn mused, stepping out of the car and catching a snowflake on her glove. "Yet the weather difference is astonishing." The snow clung to her hair and shoulders, refusing to melt immediately. It had been years since she'd seen proper snowfall, and despite everything, she felt her spirits lift at the sight.

Alexander draped a cashmere shawl around her shoulders and pressed a steaming mug of cocoa into her hands. The car's thermos kept drinks piping hot during their journey, and though it couldn't compare to homemade, the rich chocolate aroma provided comfort against the winter chill. "That's the house ahead," he said gently. "It's been quite some time since your last visit, hasn't it?"

Evelyn took a slow sip, letting the warmth spread through her. "Six or seven years, at least," she admitted. She hadn't returned since leaving for university—too busy with studies, then research projects, then fieldwork. Always another reason to stay away.

Her grandfather, Reginald Hawthorne, was too proud to ever ask her back. "If she doesn't want to come home, let her stay gone!" she could practically hear him growl. In her memories, there was little affection—just endless drills, lessons, and tests. Even at home, there were no lazy mornings or carefree days. A full night's sleep had been a rare luxury.

After her mother's death, Evelyn had convinced herself that any familial bond had died with her. As a child, she might have craved that connection, but adulthood brought different priorities—freedom above all else. Even solitude was preferable to the suffocating expectations of the Hawthorne name.

The final fracture came when she began dating Dominic Reeves. Her grandfather, who'd shown no interest in her life for years, suddenly erupted in outrage at her relationship with an "ordinary" man. His disapproval only strengthened her resolve, and she'd severed ties completely.

"Evelyn?" Alexander's voice pulled her from her thoughts. His storm-gray eyes held quiet concern. "You were miles away."

She forced a smile. "Just remembering."

"If this is too difficult, we can turn back," he offered for what must have been the tenth time that day.

She shook her head firmly. "No. It's time." However painful, she couldn't avoid this forever. Now that she and Alexander were serious, her family deserved to know—whether they cared or not.

Alexander disposed of her empty mug before taking her hand firmly in his. The silent support steadied her. Whatever awaited in that house, she wouldn't face it alone.

The Hawthorne estate loomed ahead, its gabled roofs frosted white, as they made their way up the snow-covered drive.
###Chapter 438

The Hawthorne family's estate stood not in the heart of Elmsworth but nestled in the serene outskirts. It was a sprawling property, framed by rolling hills and a winding river, as picturesque as a painting.

No one could recall exactly when the Hawthornes first settled here—it had been generations. The whispered legend that they were an ancient martial arts lineage remained unverified. No living soul had witnessed their supposed skills firsthand.

In modern times, the Hawthornes thrived in business, though not exclusively. Among them were professors, physicians, and other distinguished professionals. Their name commanded respect, yet the direct bloodline remained shrouded in mystery, adding to their enigmatic aura.

The road leading to the estate bore fresh tire tracks, the snow packed down by countless arrivals. Today was Reginald Hawthorne's birthday, and the grand celebration had drawn a flood of guests. At the gates, security halted their car for inspection.

Alexander loosened his tie, reaching for the invitation, but Evelyn rolled down her window instead. "It's me," she said quietly.

The guard blinked, startled. It had been years since her last visit. Recognition dawned after a moment, and his face lit up. "Ms. Evelyn! You've returned!"

She offered a faint smile. "For Grandfather's birthday."

"Open the gates!" he barked, waving urgently. "Inform the patriarch—Ms. Evelyn is home!"

Their excitement was palpable. Despite her absence, they still welcomed her. Alexander watched as she raised the window, her expression unreadable. He said nothing, merely squeezing her hand gently.

The drive from the gates to the main house took another ten minutes. The courtyard was already packed with luxury vehicles. Evelyn spotted Donovan Pierce's car—of course he would be here today.

But she had no desire to make a grand entrance. Crowds and small talk were not her forte.

"I'll handle the formalities," Alexander murmured, sensing her hesitation. "You know the estate well enough to slip in unnoticed and see your grandfather first, don’t you?"

She nodded. It was the better arrangement.

Alexander had brought an exquisite antique pocket watch, nestled in a velvet case—easy to carry. Evelyn’s gift, however, was a hand-carved wooden phoenix, requiring careful transport.

He leaned in, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "I’ll find you after the greetings."

"Alright," she murmured, watching as he stepped out, Harrison trailing behind with the velvet box. The winter air bit at her cheeks as she took a deep breath, steeling herself for what lay ahead.
###Chapter 439

Evelyn watched Alexander until his figure vanished from view. Only then did she step out of the car.

She noticed Donovan staring directly at her, as if he had been waiting.

Something felt off. Evelyn had already revealed herself, and the staff had surely sent word of her arrival. Yet, no servants greeted her when she exited the vehicle.

It was clear Donovan had orchestrated this—keeping others away. But she had nothing to hide now that she was back. Straightening her dress, she walked toward him.

"You finally returned," Donovan said, studying his cousin.

"I always keep my word," Evelyn replied, her tone firm.

He gave a slight nod. "Grandfather is waiting for you."

Having him lead the way was convenient. He had already cleared the path, sparing her unnecessary encounters.

"Thank you for the information you gave me before," she said, recalling the documents he had provided.

Donovan didn’t turn around. "No need. You never used it."

True, she had kept the evidence to herself rather than exposing everything.

As they walked, Evelyn realized the Hawthorne family had been watching her closely all along. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have known so much about her—or been able to gather such private details about Dominic.

"Still, I appreciate it," she said quietly.

They entered through a side building, traversing a long corridor before reaching the private residence at the back. The front was for guests; the rear was family-only, its atmosphere far more serene.

"Why didn’t you include that evidence when you revealed everything else?" Donovan asked as they walked. "Do you still care for him?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Never push someone into a corner. That’s what we were taught as children. Have you forgotten?"

Donovan smirked. "So you do remember."

Of course she did. It was ingrained in her—something she couldn’t forget even if she tried.

Upon entering the residence, Evelyn instinctively moved toward the stairs, only to see Donovan turn down the hall toward a first-floor room.

She hesitated. "Grandfather changed rooms?"

"He’s older now. Stairs are difficult for him," Donovan explained, pausing to glance back at her. "You’ve been gone too long."

Too long to even know this.

Evelyn stayed silent as Donovan added, "His health isn’t what it used to be. So don’t—" He cut himself off, then knocked lightly on the door. "Grandfather, it’s me."

A deep, aged voice rasped from inside. "Come in."

Evelyn had thought she could face him calmly. But as she stepped forward, her pulse betrayed her.
###Chapter 440

The expansive study was draped in silence, its plush carpet absorbing every sound. By the floor-to-ceiling windows, an elderly man sat motionless, his gaze fixed on the swirling snowflakes outside. The serene winter landscape should have brought peace, yet his expression remained unreadable.

What caught Evelyn's attention immediately wasn't the breathtaking view, but the high-end wheelchair supporting his frail frame. Though clearly custom-made with polished titanium accents, its presence sent a jolt through her system.

"Grandfather?" Her voice barely carried across the room.

Reginald Hawthorne didn't turn. "You've finally come home," he murmured, his voice carrying decades of unspoken history.

Evelyn approached cautiously, stopping just beyond arm's reach. Only then did he rotate the wheelchair with practiced ease. Time had etched deeper lines into his face, silvered more of his hair, but his eyes—once piercing—now held a quiet warmth that startled her.

Perhaps absence had softened her memories. Perhaps she'd imagined his disapproval all these years.

"You've grown," Reginald observed, his gaze traveling upward. The simple statement carried the weight of missed years—the child who once barely reached his waist now stood tall enough to make him crane his neck. Life's cruel irony, that the young outgrow the old.

Evelyn's attention dropped to his legs. "Your mobility..."

"Gout," Donovan interjected from behind her. "Chronic condition. Some days he manages with a cane, but—"

"—but old men have their aches," Reginald cut in sharply, silencing further explanation. His gnarled hand patted the space beside him. "Sit. I hear you've been making waves in Veridia?"

Evelyn perched on the ottoman, her fingers brushing his knee before she could stop herself. No one chastised the contact. "Just a regional competition. Hardly worth mentioning."

A ghost of a smile touched his lips. "Still pursuing perfume after all this time? Good." His sudden grip on her wrist surprised her—papery skin over steel strength as he guided her to stand. "Let me look at you properly."

As she rose, Evelyn noticed how his other hand whitened around the wheelchair armrest. The pain he'd dismissed must be excruciating. Yet his gaze never wavered from hers, as if memorizing every detail of the woman she'd become.
###Chapter 441

Evelyn remembered her grandfather wasn't the type to surrender. He'd rise at dawn every morning to train. Even at his age, Reginald Hawthorne maintained remarkable fitness. In his prime, he could stand ramrod straight and sprint like a gazelle.

Yet now he sat confined to a wheelchair. The man who once despised sitting now relied on wheels to move. Though he claimed it meant nothing, the pain etching his features betrayed the truth.

"It's fine!" Reginald tugged his blanket higher when Evelyn's gaze lingered on his knees, discomfort coloring his voice.

"How long since you left the Hawthorne estate?"
"Nearly eight years, I suppose." Evelyn's eyes clouded at the question.

"Seven years and four months precisely," Donovan interjected smoothly. Evelyn shot him a withering look.
"Seems you've adapted well to independence. That's good."

Every word from Reginald today surprised her. She'd anticipated arguments, accusations - not this gentle grandfatherly demeanor.

"Grandpa..."
"You've taken a new lover?" The abrupt personal question made her blink.

After a beat, she nodded. "Yes."

"Does he treat you right?"
"Extremely well." One word felt inadequate to describe Alexander Kensington's devotion. "Exceptionally well."

"You're certain of his intentions? When did he learn you're a Hawthorne?" Donovan's skepticism sliced through the moment.

Evelyn's voice turned steely. "I've never been more certain of anything. Yes, I was reckless before, but life's taught me harsh lessons. I don't repeat mistakes."

Donovan opened his mouth, but Reginald silenced him with a raised hand. The patriarch peered through the window, lips pursed toward a figure below. "That him?"

Following his gaze, Evelyn spotted Alexander being led across the manicured grounds by a servant. Warmth flooded her chest, softening her features. "Yes."

"Alexander Kensington. The Kensington heir does possess... credentials. Your current choice shows improved judgment."

The backhanded compliment stung. Was he implying her past choice - Dominic - had been disastrous? Reality had indeed branded that lesson into her soul with searing clarity.

"Master," a servant announced from the doorway. Alexander had arrived.

"Show him in."
The door swung open to reveal Alexander, his piercing gaze sweeping the room until it anchored on Evelyn. Only then did tension visibly leave his shoulders.

Reginald's lips quirked. "Alexander." The informal address held deliberate weight.

Unfazed, Alexander approached and inclined his torso in respectful greeting. "Mr. Hawthorne. May your vitality match the mountains."

Reginald studied the offered hand but didn't accept it. "Still 'Mr. Hawthorne,' is it?"
###Chapter 442

Reginald Hawthorne's voice boomed with authority, yet his expression remained serene.

Alexander Kensington froze for a moment. His gaze flickered toward Evelyn, realization dawning, and without hesitation, he withdrew his outstretched hand. Instead, he bowed deeply, his tone dripping with reverence. "As your grandson-in-law, I wish you boundless fortune and everlasting health."

"G—Grandson-in-law?!" The Hawthorne patriarch's eyes widened in disbelief. Were the youth of today truly so brazen? One second, he was Mr. Hawthorne, and the next, he was declaring himself family?

"The Hawthorne family has yet to acknowledge you," Donovan Pierce interjected, his usual composure slipping.

Reginald, having weathered decades of political storms, merely raised a hand to silence his grandson. His voice was dry but measured. "Alexander, given your standing, it’s appropriate for you to address me as Evelyn does. But calling yourself my grandson-in-law? That’s… premature, don’t you think?" The Hawthornes hadn’t even formally recognized Evelyn’s relationship with him—let alone accepted him as kin.

Alexander’s eyes darted to Evelyn. She blinked rapidly, lips parted in silent shock. Clearly, she hadn’t briefed her family about their entanglement. He wouldn’t press her. "It’s fine. I can wait." A slow, confident smile curved his lips. "Sooner or later, I’ll be part of this family."

Reginald was speechless.

Donovan was speechless.

Evelyn was especially speechless, torn between exasperation and reluctant admiration at his audacity.

Reginald cleared his throat, eager to steer the conversation away from the awkwardness. "I’ve heard Celestia Group has expanded into over a dozen countries recently?"

"Just dipping our toes in," Alexander replied with false modesty.

A blatant understatement. Celestia Group had established subsidiaries in each market, dominating not just cosmetics but branching into film and advertising. Their overseas influence was staggering.

Donovan, despite his reservations, couldn’t help but respect Alexander’s business acumen. They were the same age, yet Alexander had propelled the Kensingtons into the elite circle of the four great families with ruthless efficiency.

But business prowess didn’t equate to being a suitable partner. If someone as unremarkable as Dominic Reeves had treated Evelyn carelessly, how could a man of Alexander’s stature be serious? His intentions remained suspect.

"I knew your father years ago," Reginald mused, shifting topics again. "Haven’t spoken to him in ages. How is he?"

Evelyn’s brows lifted in surprise. She hadn’t realized their families had prior connections—nor had she ever met Alexander’s parents, despite their long relationship.

"In excellent health," Alexander answered smoothly. "He and my mother are currently touring the world. I rarely see them."

Ah. That explained their absence. "Traveling while young and able is wise," Reginald murmured, fingers tapping idly against his wheelchair. A shadow crossed his face as he glanced at his own legs. "At my age, such adventures are… unlikely."

Alexander caught Evelyn’s eye, a silent understanding passing between them. "If you wish to travel," he offered, voice softening, "we could accompany you."

Encouraged, Evelyn stepped forward and clasped her grandfather’s hand. "Yes, Grandpa. We’ll go wherever you want."

Reginald’s breath hitched. He stared down at her small hand covering his wrinkled one, emotions swirling too complex to name.
###Chapter 443

"Grandfather, the celebration is about to begin," Donovan remarked, glancing at his watch.

"Very well." Reginald Hawthorne snapped out of his thoughts and gave a slow nod. His gaze lingered on Evelyn, questioning.

Evelyn shook her head. "I won't be attending. Crowded gatherings aren’t my preference—you know that."

"I see." Reginald didn’t press further, turning instead to Alexander.

Without hesitation, Alexander rested a hand on Evelyn’s shoulder. "I’ll stay with her."

A faint, knowing smile curved Reginald’s lips. "Then it’s settled. I’ll have rooms prepared for you both. Stay a couple of days before leaving, hm?"

The request was directed at Evelyn, almost pleading. Seeing her grandfather’s hopeful expression, Evelyn softened instantly. "Alright, if that’s what you’d like."

Satisfied, Reginald exhaled in relief, his smile deepening. "Donovan, let’s proceed."

Donovan acknowledged with a nod, stepping forward to guide the wheelchair. Before leaving, he cast a glance at Evelyn. "Someone will escort you to your quarters shortly."

"Understood."

Evelyn watched as the two disappeared into the grand estate ahead.

Moments later, the butler arrived. "Ms. Carter, Mr. Kensington, if you’d follow me."

He led them upstairs, assigning separate rooms—strategically placed at opposite ends of the hallway. The distance between them was impossible to ignore.

Evelyn frowned, but Alexander remained unbothered, his expression unreadable.

"Ms. Carter, you must be weary. Rest well. Dinner will be sent up shortly. Should you require anything, don’t hesitate to call," the butler informed smoothly.

His efficiency was impeccable—except for the glaringly intentional room arrangement.

"Butler," Evelyn began, "isn’t this spacing a bit… excessive?"

A single glance confirmed the absurd distance. The butler bowed slightly. "Mr. Pierce’s orders. As a guest, Mr. Kensington deserves the finest accommodations."

The implication was clear: Alexander was an outsider, tolerated but not welcomed.

Evelyn opened her mouth to argue, but Alexander gently intervened. "It’s fine. The arrangements are more than adequate."

She pressed her lips together, relenting only because he seemed unbothered.

The butler dipped his head. "Excellent. I’ll leave you both to settle in."

Once alone, Evelyn huffed. "Why didn’t you let me object? Do you want to be halfway across the estate from me?"

"Do you really think protesting would change anything?" Alexander chuckled, pulling her close until her back met his chest. His breath warmed her ear as he murmured, "Your cousin made this decision deliberately. No sense making the staff uncomfortable."

He emphasized deliberately with amusement. Then, softer, he brushed his lips against her temple. "Unless… you’ll miss me?"
###Chapter 444

"That's right. I'll miss you." Evelyn wasn't shy. She boldly wrapped both arms around his neck and tilted her head. "What if you miss me?"

"There's always a solution," Alexander chuckled, leaning in to brush his lips against hers. "Check your room."

It was the same room she always stayed in at the Hawthorne residence. Evelyn pushed the door open—and her breath caught.

Everything was exactly as she'd left it. The trinkets on the dresser, the half-read novel on the nightstand, even the faint scent of lavender from the sachet tucked under her pillow. The only difference? Fresh linens, crisp from sunlight, waiting for her.

But then she noticed—no hum of an air conditioner. No radiator. Just the thick, unmoving air of a house that refused modern comforts.

Alexander frowned, scanning the room. "No AC?"

Evelyn bit her lip. "I forgot to mention—the Hawthornes don't believe in climate control. You'll have to tough it out tonight."

His brows shot up. "Seriously? In this day and age?"

She flopped onto the bed, the springs creaking familiarly. "You know the rumors about us being an old-school martial arts family? They're true. Grandpa Reginald thinks suffering builds character. No heaters in winter, no AC in summer. Just... raw endurance."

Alexander stared. "That explains why your house looks like a monastery."

The Hawthorne estate sprawled across acres, yet the interiors were stark—functional furniture, bare walls, nothing that hinted at their wealth. Meanwhile, Alexander's penthouse gleamed with smart tech and Italian marble.

Evelyn smirked. "Now you get why I gawked at your place."

"Our place," he corrected, tapping her nose.

"Right." She stretched, savoring the simplicity. "At least here, I don't have to dodge surprise attacks at 3 AM."

His jaw dropped. "They ambush you in your sleep?"

"Training never stops," she said breezily. "Grandpa's motto: 'Complacency gets you killed.'"

Alexander groaned, collapsing beside her. The ceiling fan wobbled overhead. "...I suddenly regret this trip."

A beat. Then Evelyn burst out laughing.

But his expression turned serious. "Evelyn. There's something else."

The air between them shifted.

"What?" she whispered.

He exhaled. "I think your grandfather knows."

Her blood ran cold.

Knows what?

The unspoken truth hung between them—heavy, dangerous.

Outside, a cicada screeched. The room felt ten degrees hotter.

And for the first time, Evelyn wondered if coming home was a mistake.
###Chapter 445

The bitter cold seeped through every crack of the Hawthorne residence. Without heating, the rooms felt more like ice chambers than living spaces.

"Even the guest rooms lack proper heating? Does your family enjoy subjecting visitors to such torture?"

Dominic couldn't help but chuckle.

With so many guests arriving for the celebration, surely not all would leave the same night. Would they really have to endure this freezing discomfort?

Evelyn shook her head. "The front wing is reserved for visitors—those rooms have heating. This section is strictly for the Hawthorne family."

The implication was clear: outsiders received comfort while family members endured austerity. Dominic frowned, then smirked. "So, does that mean I’m considered family now?"

Why else would they stick me in an unheated room?

Evelyn tilted her head, considering. "Logically, yes."

Dominic exhaled, torn between amusement and resignation. "What an honor."

Their playful banter couldn’t stave off the chill for long.

It wasn’t the right moment to strip down and huddle under blankets, so they rose instead. "Let’s explore the grounds," Evelyn suggested. "I’ve been here twice but never had the chance to look around properly."

The first time Dominic visited, it had been a brief, obligatory engagement—no time for sightseeing. But today was different. His purpose had shifted, and so had his mood.

Evelyn hesitated but didn’t refuse. Bundled in coats, they stepped into the snow-dusted courtyard.

The front hall buzzed with celebration, packed with well-wishers and disciples of the influential Hawthorne family. But here, in the private wing, silence reigned.

Snowflakes drifted lazily, blanketing the ground in pristine white. Elmsworth’s winters were mild, but tonight, the snowfall was steady. Their boots crunched softly against the fresh powder, leaving twin trails behind.

Hand in hand, they walked until Evelyn paused, glancing back at their footprints—his large, hers small. A mischievous glint lit her eyes.

"Wait here," she said, pulling away.

Carefully, she stepped in deliberate patterns, pressing one foot after another into the snow. When she finished, a near-perfect heart shape marked the ground.

She clasped her hands, admiring her work. "Not bad, right?"

Dominic smirked, then traced his own path around the edges of her heart, expanding it with a larger outline. "Mine’s not half bad either."

Evelyn scrunched her nose. "Yours is lopsided. Mine’s better."

"Doesn’t matter how it looks," he countered, gazing at the intertwined hearts. "What matters is that you’re inside mine."

The sweetness of his words warmed her more than any fire could. She beamed.

This courtyard had once been her training ground—where she’d spent countless hours mastering kickboxing and other disciplines. As a child, she’d seen it as nothing more than a place of drills and discipline.

Now, under the falling snow, it felt different.
###Chapter 446

The heavy snowfall blanketed Evelyn's memories of this place, perhaps because she now had someone reliable by her side. Though the courtyard remained physically unchanged, it felt entirely different to her now.

"Are you cold? Should we head back inside?" Alexander Kensington asked, his hands resting protectively on Evelyn's shoulders as he studied her expression.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "It won't be much warmer indoors. If we stay active out here, the cold won't bother us as much."

She spoke the truth - their assigned room was drafty and unheated. Without servants bustling about, the ancestral home felt particularly frigid. "If you're uncomfortable, we don't have to stay overnight. We can return to the city," Alexander suggested after a moment's consideration. He couldn't fathom how Evelyn had endured these conditions for so many years.

Though Alexander had conducted business with the Hawthorne family before, their dealings had been strictly professional. He'd never imagined they maintained such antiquated living standards.

"I grew up like this, so it's nothing new. I'm more concerned about you adjusting," Evelyn replied. It wasn't that she couldn't adapt - she simply hadn't visited in so long that readjusting took effort. Once accustomed to modern comforts, no one willingly returned to hardship.

"If you can tolerate it, so can I," Alexander began, but Evelyn suddenly raised her hand to silence him, her gaze fixed on something in the distance.

Following her line of sight, Alexander barely discerned a shadowy figure among the snow-laden fruit trees that bordered the Hawthorne estate. The heavy snowfall made identification impossible at this distance.

"You recognize that person?" Alexander asked quietly.

Evelyn didn't answer immediately. Meeting someone familiar on family grounds wasn't unusual, but her reaction suggested this encounter held special significance. "I believe it's someone I've been wanting to see. Wait here," she finally said.

Moving cautiously, Evelyn approached without calling out, her steps measured as if afraid to startle the mysterious figure. Alexander had never seen her behave this way. Frowning, he followed quietly behind.

The crunch of snow underfoot betrayed their approach. The figure tensed and turned abruptly.

"Is it really you?" Evelyn gasped, clapping her hands together in delighted recognition when the person's face came into view.

The stranger appeared equally shocked. "You...?"

Evelyn laughed breathlessly. "I've been wondering where you disappeared to. What are the chances we'd meet here of all places?" She hurried forward eagerly.

Both the stranger and Alexander stood frozen in bewilderment.

"What are you doing here?" the stranger asked, clearly astonished by the encounter.

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with amusement. "That's exactly what I was going to ask you!"
###Chapter 447

Evelyn never imagined she would find the young man she'd been searching for in her family's private garden.

He looked almost the same, except the light in his eyes was gone. A heavy aura clung to him now, dark and unreadable.

"Everyone here has the same goal tonight," Julian murmured, tilting his head slightly toward the grand ballroom.

"Then why aren’t you inside?" Evelyn countered.

"Neither are you," Julian shot back, his gaze locking onto hers.

Though his demeanor was far more somber than before, he still had that sharp tongue.

"You owe me an explanation," Evelyn said, the words finally spilling out after months of frustration. "You promised to finish the commission, then vanished without a word. No calls. No messages. Nothing."

Julian's expression darkened further. He didn’t offer excuses, just a quiet, "I had my reasons. The piece was delivered. No charge. Consider us even."

He stood with his hands tucked into the pockets of his navy-blue coat, the crisp winter air making his breath visible. Against the snow-covered garden, he looked almost ethereal—youthful yet weighed down.

Evelyn shook her head. "Even? You never gave me the raw materials. Where’s my wood?" She held out her palm, demanding.

They had agreed—she would take home a sample of that rare, fragrant wood she adored. She had planned to return for more.

"I don’t have it," Julian said flatly.

Before Evelyn could argue, footsteps crunched in the snow behind them. A deep voice called, "Julian."

At the sound, Julian stiffened, his jaw tightening almost imperceptibly.

"Julian," the voice repeated, closer now.

A man in his late forties approached—tall, broad-shouldered, with an air of authority that demanded attention. His sharp eyes flicked to Evelyn briefly before dismissing her entirely.

"Why are you out here?" the man demanded.

"Too crowded inside," Julian replied without turning.

"Are you done? Get back in there. They’re waiting for you." The command was absolute, leaving no room for defiance.

Julian hesitated for only a second before obeying, stepping past Evelyn without another word. But as he did, his eyes met hers—just for a moment—and she saw something flicker in them. Resignation. Discomfort.

Evelyn didn’t know why she spoke. Maybe it was that look. Maybe it was the way the older man’s tone grated on her nerves.

"Wait," she called, stopping Julian mid-step. "We’re not finished."

The man—clearly someone important—paused. Slowly, he turned, his piercing gaze finally settling on Evelyn with cold scrutiny.
###Chapter 448

Alistair Prescott's gaze was like twin lasers, sweeping over Evelyn from head to toe with icy precision. His eyes held no warmth, only clear disapproval of her presence. When those cold eyes locked onto her, Evelyn felt an involuntary shudder race down her spine—but then she remembered.

He meant nothing to her.

Straightening her posture, she met his stare head-on, refusing to back down.

Alistair's brows twitched in surprise. Few dared to hold his gaze, let alone a woman who looked barely out of her twenties. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, a smooth voice cut through the tension.

"Mr. Prescott."

Alexander Kensington approached, his polished demeanor a stark contrast to the brewing storm. He stopped beside Evelyn, his presence immediately shifting the dynamic.

Alistair's expression flickered. "Alexander Kensington? I assumed you'd sent a representative. I didn't expect you to attend personally."

"Traffic was unfortunate," Alistair replied, his tone noticeably more civil than before.

Alexander smiled politely before glancing at the sullen teenager beside Alistair. "And this is?"

Alistair nudged the boy forward. "My son, Julian. Julian, this is the director of Celestia Group, Alexander Kensington."

Evelyn's breath caught.

Julian Prescott?

As in the Prescott family—one of the most influential dynasties in Garnet Springs?

Her mind reeled. The moody, woodcarving-obsessed boy she'd been casually bantering with was that Julian Prescott?

The world really was impossibly small.

Julian muttered a stiff, "Mr. Kensington," clearly uncomfortable with the formality.

Alistair's jaw tightened at his son's reluctance, but before he could reprimand him, Julian sidestepped his father’s reach.

Alistair's face darkened.

"Mr. Prescott," Evelyn interjected smoothly, mimicking Alexander's respectful tone. "I still have some unfinished matters with Julian. Would you mind if I borrowed him for a moment?"

Alistair frowned. "And you are?"

Alexander’s arm slid around Evelyn’s waist. "My fiancée," he said, the word deliberate.

For a heartbeat, silence.

Then—

"Fiancée?"

Both Alistair and Julian stared, stunned.
###Chapter 449

The shock was evident even on Alistair Prescott's usually composed face. In their elite social circles, marriages were rarely matters of the heart—they were strategic alliances, carefully orchestrated affairs where whispers traveled faster than formal announcements.

For someone like Alexander Kensington, one of the most sought-after bachelors in Garnet Springs, to suddenly announce an engagement? It was unheard of.

Alexander had always been the epitome of devotion—to his family, to his empire. Women vied for his attention, but none had ever claimed his heart. Until now.

"Fiancée?" Julian Prescott blurted out, his gaze snapping toward Evelyn.

"Julian!" Alistair reprimanded sharply, his voice cutting through the tension before turning back to Evelyn with practiced politeness. "This is unexpected but delightful news. And how should I address you, young lady?"

Evelyn extended her hand gracefully. "Evelyn Carter. It's a pleasure, Mr. Prescott."

Alistair hesitated, his brow furrowing slightly. "Carter…" He studied her for a moment before realization dawned. "You wouldn’t happen to be Reginald Hawthorne’s granddaughter, would you?"

Evelyn’s lips parted in surprise. The Hawthorne family was notoriously private, their inner circle impenetrable. Few outside their immediate connections could place her lineage so precisely.

Yet Alistair had.

She inclined her head. "Yes, I am."

"Ah." His expression shifted, something unreadable flickering in his eyes. "Well, Alex, you’ve certainly chosen well."

Alexander smirked, his arm brushing against Evelyn’s. "I know."

Evelyn cleared her throat. "Mr. Prescott, if it’s alright, I’d like to speak with Julian privately for a moment."

Alistair glanced at his son, then nodded. "Of course. Julian, don’t keep your friends waiting."

With that, he strode back toward the banquet hall, leaving the air lighter in his absence.

The moment he was gone, Julian turned to Evelyn, his expression unreadable. "Evelyn Carter," he repeated slowly, as if testing the weight of her name.

She met his gaze evenly. "Julian Prescott."

The name settled between them like a revelation. The unassuming woodcarver she’d met in that tiny shop—he wasn’t just a craftsman. He was a Prescott.

And he was looking at her as if seeing her for the first time.
###Chapter 450

Evelyn stretched her hand toward Julian, her voice firm. "Where's my wood?"

Julian pressed his lips together, clearly exasperated by her persistence. "I don’t have it anymore. It’s all gone," he said flatly.

The flicker in his eyes betrayed him. Evelyn wasn’t fooled. "I don’t care! A promise is a promise. If you used it up, then start over and carve me a new one. Even children should keep their word!"

Her stubbornness left Julian no room to argue. Frustrated, he shot a pleading glance at Alexander. "Aren’t you going to say something?"

Alexander merely lifted a shoulder, his expression indifferent.

Realizing he was cornered, Julian exhaled sharply. "Why are you so fixated on that piece of wood? I already made your birthday gift. What more do you want?"

Evelyn could have explained, but his dismissive tone made her bristle. "That’s my concern. You’re the one who made the promise."

Watching Julian’s face flush with irritation, Alexander finally intervened. "If it’s inconvenient, we can retrieve it from your place. If it’s about compensation, name your price." He paused, then added carefully, "And if there’s some other issue you can’t discuss openly, maybe we can help."

Evelyn stayed silent but gave a small nod of agreement.

Julian rubbed his temple. "It’s not a problem. I just don’t carry it around." He met Evelyn’s gaze reluctantly. "If you really want it, wait until next week. I’ll bring it to you myself."

Relief flickered across Evelyn’s face. "You swear?"

"Yes!" Julian snapped, offended by her doubt. "Do you think I’d lie?"

"Fine. I’ll wait." Evelyn lowered her hand, satisfied—but then a thought struck her. "Did you change your number? What if you vanish again and ignore my calls?"

Before Julian could respond, Alexander cut in smoothly. "Don’t worry. Even if he disappears, the Prescott family won’t. We’ll find him." His tone turned pointed. "Besides, I’m sure young Mr. Prescott wouldn’t break his word twice, would he?"

Julian’s jaw tightened. His fists clenched at his sides before he forced out through gritted teeth, "I’ll keep my promise this time." With that, he spun on his heel and strode away, his posture rigid with resolve.

"If you keep staring, I might get jealous," Alexander teased, draping his coat over Evelyn’s shoulders to shield her from the cold.

Evelyn watched Julian’s retreating figure before turning to Alexander. "I never expected this."

"Expected what?"

"That he’s a Prescott." She shook her head. "I knew Mr. Prescott had a son—his heir, raised under strict expectations. I just never imagined it would be Julian."

It made sense, given how long she’d been away from the Hawthorne family. But what puzzled her was that Alexander, who moved in the same elite circles, had never mentioned him before.

"Funny how small the world is," Alexander mused, tilting his head toward the sky. "It’s snowing again. Should we head back?"

Evelyn glanced around as delicate flakes began dusting the ground. With a nod, she fell into step beside him, their footprints marking the fresh snow behind them.
###Chapter 451

The night at the Hawthorne family manor had been peaceful. Yet, Alexander found himself stirring awake at the first light of dawn, disturbed by the commotion downstairs. He wasn’t usually an early riser, but in unfamiliar surroundings, he slept lightly.

The slightest noise could rouse him.

Pushing back the covers, he crossed the room to the window. The rain had finally ceased, and the front yard was clear of snow. Below, members of the Hawthorne family were already engaged in their morning training routine.

They jogged in the biting cold as if the chill didn’t faze them. The sight alone made Alexander feel a phantom warmth radiating from their disciplined movements.

A soft knock interrupted his thoughts.

He opened the door to find Evelyn standing there, rubbing her eyes with a yawn. "You're awake already?"

"Just got up," he replied. "Give me a minute to freshen up, then we'll head down."

Evelyn nodded, though her drowsy expression betrayed her longing to crawl back into bed. But this wasn’t home, and sleep wouldn’t come easily here anyway.

Once ready, they descended the grand staircase. The manor buzzed with activity—housekeepers hurried about, preparing an elaborate breakfast. The Hawthornes' rigorous morning regimen demanded substantial fuel, and the staff worked efficiently to ensure everything was perfect by the time the family returned.

"You're early," Donovan remarked as he strode into the dining room, clad in a thin wool sweater after finishing his training.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "I used to wake up at this hour all the time." She glanced around. "Where’s Grandfather?"

Her grandfather, Reginald Hawthorne, had always been the first to rise. His discipline was unmatched, and no one dared to be late under his watch.

She asked because she intended to say goodbye before they left. Had she been away too long? Being back felt strange, almost unsettling.

With the snow gone, they needed to depart soon.

"Still asleep, perhaps," Donovan checked his watch. He read the question in her eyes before she voiced it. "Grandfather isn’t the same anymore. He struggles with sleep these days. His body can’t keep up with his old routine."

"Insomnia?" Evelyn’s brow furrowed. She had noticed the fatigue in Reginald’s eyes yesterday—the dullness where there had once been fire. But she hadn’t realized it was this severe.

Is age finally catching up to him?

"Let’s eat first," Donovan suggested, accepting a napkin from a housekeeper to wipe his hands. "You’re leaving today, aren’t you?"

Evelyn nodded. "The snow’s stopped, and we have matters to attend to. We thought—"

"Go whenever you’re ready. I’ll let Grandfather know when he wakes."

"No," Evelyn insisted. "I’ll wait to say goodbye myself."

Leaving without a word would weigh on her. Despite everything, this house still held warmth beneath its strict exterior. And now, seeing her grandfather’s declining health, she couldn’t just walk away.

"Suit yourself." Donovan finished cleaning his hands and took his seat at the table.

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Alexander before they joined him.

Breakfast passed in silence, broken only by the occasional clink of silverware against porcelain. Alexander remained quiet—Evelyn had warned him about the Hawthorne rule: no talking at the table.

At home, discipline reigned supreme. Outside these walls, the rules relaxed. But here, tradition held firm.
###Chapter 452

Today, Alexander Kensington experienced it firsthand.

After absentmindedly picking at her food, Evelyn Carter set down her fork. "I'm going to see Grandfather."

"Alright," Donovan Pierce replied quietly, his gaze lowering.

To an outsider like Alexander, the Hawthorne family's dynamics were perplexing.

On the surface, they appeared distant. Even after years apart, their reunion lacked any visible warmth. It was as though Evelyn's presence—or absence—made no difference.

Yet beneath that cool exterior lay meticulous care.

Though the room had no heater, thick quilts and hot water bottles had been discreetly placed beneath the duvet—no explanation offered.

Similarly, when breakfast consisted only of porridge and eggs, the staff had prepared an extra sandwich and glasses of milk. The portions were small, clearly arranged specifically for Evelyn and Alexander.

Meanwhile, Harrison had planned to stay at a nearby hotel after dropping them off, only to later inform Alexander that the Hawthornes had prepared a guest room for him.

The Hawthornes were quietly considerate, their kindness unspoken, their warmth hidden behind stoic expressions.

It was the opposite of the Kensingtons. The Kensingtons performed affection openly, their interactions dripping with exaggerated love—yet behind closed doors, their actions told a different story.

Given the choice, Alexander preferred the Hawthornes' brand of quiet care. Easier to navigate.

His gaze lingered on Donovan until the man looked up. Their eyes met. After a beat, Alexander smiled.

Upstairs, Evelyn hesitated before knocking. Instead, she turned the handle and pushed the door open.

For years, Reginald Hawthorne had slept with his door unlocked. Unsure if he was awake, she peeked in cautiously.

"Evelyn, is that you?"

She froze, then nodded, voice rough. "Grandfather, you're awake."

She stepped inside as Reginald shifted, propping himself up against the headboard.

Evelyn quickly grabbed a pillow to support his back before standing beside the bed—just as she had as a child. It had become habit.

This time, however, Reginald gestured to the chair. "Sit. Let me look at you properly." His voice lacked its former strength. No matter how fiercely he denied aging, time left its marks.

Evelyn sat, studying his face. Age spots dotted his skin, his eyes no longer sharp. Deep wrinkles framed tired eyes. "Grandfather," she murmured, "have you been sleeping poorly?"
###Chapter 453

Reginald Hawthorne let out a weary sigh. "What nonsense are you talking about? Who told you I can't sleep? Don't listen to Donovan Pierce's ridiculous stories!"

Evelyn Carter saw right through his denial. After decades of being the unshakable pillar of the Hawthorne family, he would never admit that time was wearing him down. That his body wasn't as strong as it used to be.

But she understood his pride. Instead of challenging him, she played along. "I know you choose to stay awake, but didn't you always drill into us how crucial rest is for martial artists? You said our bodies need recovery time." She tilted her head. "Yet here you are, breaking your own rules."

To her astonishment, Reginald chuckled—a rare sound from the stern patriarch. After a beat, his expression softened. "You still remember my lessons?"

"Every word." How could she forget? Those teachings were etched into her bones. She could recite them in her sleep.

"Then you must remember the punishments too," Reginald said quietly.

Evelyn's fingers twitched. Those memories were branded into her—the very reason she'd once fled this gilded cage.

Back then, all she could think was how suffocating life was under the Hawthorne roof. She never imagined the outside world could be crueler. The discipline she'd resented had been armor she didn't realize she'd needed.

When she didn't answer, Reginald patted her hand—an awkward gesture from a man more accustomed to giving orders than comfort. "I was too harsh with you," he admitted gruffly. "But I don't regret it. I'm just... glad you're home."

The words cost him. Evelyn hadn't expected an apology, yet hearing it dissolved the last remnants of her resentment.

Looking back, every Hawthorne was raised this way. No special treatment for being female—but no extra burdens either. The family's survival demanded this rigor. Without it, how could they withstand the vipers constantly circling their power?

Now she understood—Dominic Reeves had been the wedge between her and her family. She'd stayed away out of pride, determined to prove herself before returning in triumph. She'd dreamed of making Reginald accept Dominic.

How wrong she'd been.

Sitting here now, the past felt like fog clearing. That simple pat on her hand was more healing than any grand gesture.

"Grandfather." The word slipped out before she could stop it. Then, shocking them both, Evelyn leaned into his embrace. "I'm sorry."

Reginald stiffened. In decades of fatherhood and grandfatherhood, no one had dared such intimacy. His children and disciples treated him with fearful respect, scattering like startled birds at his approach.

Yet instead of pushing her away, he hesitated—then carefully rested a hand on her back. The motion was stiff, unpracticed. Like relearning a forgotten language.

"Foolish girl," he muttered, but his voice lacked its usual bite. For the first time in years, the mighty Reginald Hawthorne remembered what it felt like to simply be family.
###Chapter 454

"Grandfather, I'm sorry for being so reckless," Evelyn murmured. She felt ashamed for causing such turmoil within the Hawthorne family over a man.

"Foolish child, everyone has their rebellious phase." Reginald sighed, his voice softening. "Just remember, this will always be your home." He turned his head, coughing lightly into his hand.

The sound made Evelyn jolt upright, her eyes wide with concern. "Are you alright? Should I call the doctor?"

"Don't fuss," he chided, waving her off. "It's nothing a glass of water and some rest won't fix." He reached for the glass on his bedside table, taking a slow sip before setting it down. "See? Perfectly fine."

His gaze lingered on her, thoughtful. "You're leaving soon, aren't you? I suppose I shouldn't worry. You've always been capable." He hesitated before adding, "That Alexander Kensington... he seems decent. But don't rush into anything. Take your time."

When she didn't respond immediately, his expression darkened. "Evelyn... don't tell me you've already—"

She bit her lip, debating whether to confess. But lying to him felt worse. "Grandfather... Alexander and I are already married. We have the certificate."

"What?!" Reginald bolted upright, his face paling. "You—how could you—?"

"It wasn't planned!" she blurted. "We haven't announced it publicly yet. We weren't trying to hide it from you."

"Not announced?" he repeated, his frown deepening.

A heavy silence settled between them. If this had been made public, the Hawthornes would have known immediately.

"Does Donovan know?" Reginald finally asked.

"I... don't think so." If he had, Reginald would have been the first to hear.

"Good." He exhaled sharply, nodding. "You've grown up. Making your own decisions now."

But Evelyn knew that tone—he was furious.

"Grandfather, it was a complicated situation. I never meant to keep it from you."

Back then, she had married Alexander in a haze of impulsiveness. One moment, she needed his help; the next, she had accidentally pulled out a marriage registration form instead of the documents she intended.

Yet, she didn’t regret it.

Reginald closed his eyes, leaning back against the pillows. "What's done is done. Should I demand you divorce him?" He sighed, reopening his eyes. "No. But since it's official, don't hide it any longer. Announce it properly. I won’t let anyone in this family disrespect you."

Evelyn’s chest warmed. He wasn’t happy, but he wouldn’t stand in her way.

"Thank you," she whispered.

He gave a tired wave. "Just promise me one thing."

"Anything."

"Make sure he deserves you."

She smiled. "He does."
###Chapter 455

Returning from the Hawthorne family estate, Alexander noticed Evelyn was more preoccupied than usual.

She spent every waking hour in the lab, often bringing her work home with her.

After days of watching her rush through meals and disappear into her makeshift workspace, Alexander finally confronted her. "What's keeping you so busy, Evelyn?"

At her request, he had cleared out a room in their home for her projects. Now, he wondered if that had been a mistake.

Home should be a place to rest. Why does she insist on working here too?

"I'm developing something new!" Evelyn answered brightly, unfazed by his concern. She thrived under pressure—this was nothing new to her.

"Is this about the Olivella soap? If it's too much, I can assign someone to assist you. We could even revisit the partnership terms. There's no need to exhaust yourself."

The dark shadows beneath her eyes troubled him.

He had checked—Phoenix Labs had no major projects underway. The team handled smaller tasks, leaving Evelyn to focus solely on the Olivella line. So why was she pushing herself so hard?

"The Olivella soap?" She blinked, then shook her head. "No, that's not what I'm working on."

"Then what is it?" Alexander frowned. "Did Gregory assign you another project without informing me?"

He made a mental note to have words with the general manager.

"No, nothing like that." Realizing she had been distant lately, Evelyn set aside her notes. "I'm creating an essential oil blend for my grandfather."

"Your grandfather?"

His first thought was why an elderly statesman like Reginald Hawthorne would need perfume. But when she specified essential oil, it clicked. "For his insomnia?"

He recalled hearing about Reginald's sleeplessness during their visit. Many older adults struggled with it, but he hadn't expected Evelyn to take it so personally.

"Yes," she confirmed. "I want to formulate something tailored just for him—something to ease his mind and help him sleep."

A thoughtful gesture, but...

"Those already exist on the market," Alexander pointed out. "Lavender, sandalwood—plenty of options. Why go through the trouble of making your own?"

If commercial blends were available, why reinvent the wheel?

Evelyn understood his skepticism. "There are plenty of products, yes. Some even work well. But according to Donovan, my grandfather refuses to see a doctor. When the family tried using store-bought oils, he noticed and demanded they stop. They had little effect anyway."

She met his gaze. "But if I make it for him, he won't refuse."

Alexander nodded slowly. "Because it's from you."

Exactly.
###Chapter 456

The elderly could be so stubborn. The older they got, the more they resisted medical treatment. Especially someone like Reginald Hawthorne—a man who had practiced kickboxing his entire life and prided himself on his robust health. The mere thought of seeing a doctor made him scoff.

But if his granddaughter made something for him? That was different.

"That’s what I’m hoping for, but I’m not sure Grandfather will actually use it. Still, I have to try." Evelyn paused, then added, "Essential oils are like perfumes—every perfumer has their own signature style."

"Take thevender and sandalwood, for example. The ingredients, the ratios, the blending process—they all vary. The final product is unique to the creator. That’s why I want to make this for him myself. It’s not the same as buying it off a shelf."

She had been away from the Hawthorne family for years, and guilt still lingered in her heart. Now, seeing her grandfather struggle with insomnia, she wanted to do something—anything—to ease his suffering.

Alexander Kensington understood her determination. He couldn’t stop her, but he could set boundaries. "Fine. But you have to promise me one thing—you won’t overwork yourself."

He checked his watch. "10:30 p.m. That’s your cutoff. Every night, no exceptions. If you can’t stick to that, I’ll have your little lab cleared out before you can blink."

Evelyn opened her mouth to protest—10:30 was absurdly early—but the threat in his tone made her reconsider. "Fine," she huffed.

"Good girl." He pinched her nose affectionately.

"Tyrant," she muttered under her breath.

"What was that?" He leaned in, pretending not to hear.

Evelyn laughed, pushing him away. "Nothing! I said okay. Now let me get back to work. You can just… sit there and look pretty, alright?" She patted his head like he was a child and darted off before he could respond.

Alexander watched her go, shaking his head with a smile. The thought crossed his mind—what if they had a child together? The idea sent a warm thrill through him.

"What did you just say? Say it again!" The voice, usually smooth and charming, turned sharp enough to shatter glass.

Adrienne Prescott winced, covering her ears. "Good grief, lower your voice!"

"How can I? This is insane! Who told you this? Alexander Kensington—engaged? To whom? Certainly not me, and I would know!" Cassandra Winslow let out a laugh, but it was brittle, uncertain.

Adrienne’s expression was deadly serious.

Cassandra’s palms grew damp. She clenched her fists, nails biting into her skin. "Adrienne… repeat what you just said. Slowly."
###Chapter 457

"Cassandra, I don't want to tell you if you're going to react like this," Adrienne said cautiously. Adrienne had barely uttered a word, and Cassandra already exploded. If she had heard the whole story, it would have been far worse.

Adrienne stood up abruptly. "Actually, I just remembered I have something urgent at home. I should go."

"Don't you dare leave!" Cassandra grabbed her wrist. How could she let her escape so easily?

"You didn’t explain properly. Are you trying to drive me insane? Tell me—where did you hear this? And who is Alexander engaged to?"

The question burned on Cassandra’s tongue. Deep down, she refused to believe it. She had been by Alexander Kensington’s side for years. There weren’t even female pets around him, much less women. How could a man who never dated suddenly be engaged? If this had come from anyone else, she would’ve laughed it off as a ridiculous joke. But Adrienne wouldn’t lie to her.

Adrienne Prescott belonged to one of Garnet Springs’ elite families. She was Cassandra’s closest friend and knew exactly how obsessed Cassandra was with Alexander. She wouldn’t joke about something like this.

"Cass, it might not even be true. I only heard it through gossip. Don’t take it too seriously." Adrienne bit her lip, hesitating.

"Forget I said anything. Treat it as baseless rumors. Don’t overreact."

"Adrienne!" Cassandra yanked her friend’s arm, stomping her foot. "You’re killing me! I know the difference between truth and lies. Just tell me what you heard, and I won’t hold you responsible!"

Cassandra’s temper was infamous in the entertainment industry. If she weren’t so famous—and if her brother, Sebastian Winslow, didn’t constantly clean up her messes—she would’ve been canceled long ago. Even now, her assistant hovered nervously outside the dressing room after being screamed at moments earlier.

"It was just hearsay!"

Adrienne sighed. "Did you know Reginald Hawthorne celebrated his birthday recently?"

Cassandra nodded automatically, then shook her head. She had no idea.

The Winslows had risen quickly in recent years, but they were still newcomers among the elite. They didn’t mingle with the old-money families like the Hawthornes.

"He’s from the Hawthorne family in Elmsworth. You know, the reclusive political dynasty?" Adrienne explained patiently, but Cassandra cut her off.

"I don’t care about the Hawthornes! I care about Alexander! Get to the point!"

Adrienne’s lips thinned. "I am getting there. Relax. Even if this is true, it’s just an engagement, not a wedding. Why are you freaking out?"

"How can I not freak out? I’ve spent years guarding him, scaring off every woman who looked his way. And now you’re telling me he’s engaged? To who?" Cassandra’s voice rose to a shriek.
###Chapter 458

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the room as Cassandra Winslow clenched her fists.

Alexander Kensington had rejected her countless times, but at least there had been no other women in his life. That was the only reason she tolerated his indifference—because deep down, she believed he loved her without realizing it.

The truth was obvious, yet unspoken.

She had waited patiently, convinced that one day he would wake up and see what was right in front of him. But now? An engagement? The mere thought sent a sharp pang of dread through her chest.

"That's why I was so shocked when I heard," Adrienne Prescott said, nodding in agreement. "You never mentioned he was seeing anyone seriously, let alone engaged!"

Cassandra's nails dug into her palms. "Just tell me everything. Now."

Adrienne sighed. "It was Mr. Hawthorne's birthday. My uncle attended with his son. When he returned, he mentioned something about Alexander being engaged. I overheard it by accident."

Cassandra blinked. "That's it?"

Adrienne shrugged. "That's all I know."

Cassandra exhaled sharply, frustration bubbling inside her. "You're telling me you have no idea who he's engaged to?"

"My uncle didn't say. He just mentioned that since Mr. Kensington was already engaged, the wedding preparations would start soon. That's all."

Adrienne had been eavesdropping when Alistair Prescott had casually dropped the news to his wife. It wasn't unusual—social events and gift exchanges were always the women's domain, and he had likely mentioned it so Adrienne would be aware.

Of course, Adrienne knew how Cassandra felt about Alexander. She had been in love with him for years.

Cassandra's mind raced. If this was true, she needed to know who her competition was. How could she strategize if she didn't even know the enemy?

"Don't panic," Adrienne said, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "Why don't you just ask Alexander directly?"

"No." Cassandra's voice was firm.

If the rumor was false, she could laugh it off as a joke. But if it was true? She'd be humiliated.

She wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

Not yet.

Not until she had a plan.
###Chapter 459

It wasn't an option to approach Alexander directly, but there were always alternative strategies to consider.

Sebastian Winslow had been swamped lately. He had his feet propped up on his desk, phone in hand, shamelessly flirting with his latest crush when Cassandra Winslow burst into his office. The sudden intrusion nearly made him drop his phone, his expression flickering between shock and forced composure before he managed to school his features.

"Wow, what a surprise!" Sebastian drawled, tilting his head with exaggerated amusement. "You never visit me. Did you finally remember you have a brother?"

His gaze flicked to the bag in her hand, and he smirked. "You brought food? Don’t tell me you came all this way just to feed me."

Cassandra laughed, breezing past his sarcasm as she set the cake box and coffee cup on his desk. "You guessed it. I bought these just for you. Happy?"

"Seriously?" Sebastian immediately swung his legs down and leaned forward, eyes lighting up. "No way—red velvet cake and a caramel macchiato? You actually remembered my favorites."

He cradled the cake box like it was treasure, grinning but making no move to open it. "If this is your way of buttering me up, you might as well just ask."

Cassandra pulled a chair opposite him and sat, resting her chin on her hands. "Who says I want anything? Can’t a sister spoil her brother for once?"

Sebastian snorted, shaking his head. "Nice try. You only bribe me when you need something."

The rich scent of cream cheese frosting and caramel wafted from the bag, making his stomach growl. Cassandra wrinkled her nose—she’d never liked the overpowering sweetness of caramel—but she kept her smile in place.

"Fine," she sighed dramatically. "But you’re overthinking it. Just eat the cake."

Sebastian narrowed his eyes. "Nope. Not falling for it. Spill."

Cassandra resisted the urge to smack him. Instead, she batted her lashes. "Aw, come on. Can’t I just be nice?"

Sebastian hesitated, his guard slipping slightly. "You swear?"

"Forget it." She reached for the bag. "If you don’t want it, I’ll give it to someone who’ll appreciate it."

"Hey!" He yanked the bag back, clutching it protectively. "You said it was mine. No take-backs."

He took a sip of the macchiato, then dug into the cake with a spoon, humming in delight. "Oh my god, this is heaven." Leaning back, he closed his eyes in bliss.

"Good, right?" Cassandra leaned in, propping her elbows on the desk. Her smile was all innocence.

Sebastian cracked one eye open, suspicious. "Too good. What’s the catch?"

Cassandra just grinned wider.
###Chapter 460

"This is divine! Did you get it from Prescott Patisserie? Their pastries are out of this world! No one comes close!" Sebastian's eyes sparkled with genuine delight. "I mean it! Would I lie about dessert? Here, try a bite!"

He scooped a generous portion onto his spoon and extended it toward Cassandra.

She recoiled with visible distaste. Sebastian sighed dramatically. "How could anyone refuse this masterpiece?"

As he devoured another mouthful, Cassandra watched calmly until half the cake disappeared. "Sebastian," she began casually, "have you seen Alexander lately?"

"Nope!" He spoke through a mouthful of red velvet, occasionally pausing to sip his macchiato. "No joint projects recently. He's swamped, I'm buried - you know how he is. Getting him out for drinks is like pulling teeth. You probably see him more than I do anyway." He paused mid-bite. "Wait... why do you ask?"

Under his suddenly suspicious gaze, Cassandra smiled sweetly. "Just a small favor I need your help with."

The innocent expression didn't fool him. Sebastian nearly choked on his cake - that harmless smile was always her deadliest weapon. He slammed the spoon down. "I knew it! There's always an agenda with you!"

"Don't be dramatic!" Cassandra tilted her head, golden curls bouncing. "It's nothing major. We haven't all caught up in ages! Just think of it as... facilitating a friendly reunion."

She clasped her hands excitedly. "And didn't you say there are no collaborations happening? Perfect timing to brainstorm new opportunities! Two birds, one stone - genius, right?"

Sebastian's appetite vanished. He tossed his napkin onto the half-eaten dessert. "Out with it. What's the real plan? You want me to take you to see him?"

Cassandra nodded eagerly.

"That's bribery!" He snorted, stirring his macchiato aggressively. "Since when do you need my help anyway? You've practically got a GPS tracker on the man. Did he finally get that restraining order?"

Safe in the knowledge this wasn't some world-ending crisis, Sebastian couldn't resist teasing.

She shot him a withering glare. "That's mean! I'm asking because it's... delicate."

"What's there to be delicate about?" He nearly spat out his drink laughing. "You already know all his most embarrassing childhood secrets - the bedwetting incident, that time he—" The words died in his throat under Cassandra's murderous stare. Clearing his throat, he muttered, "Fine. What exactly do you need?"

Cassandra's next words came out in a rush. "I need to know if his engagement is real."

The macchiato sprayed across Sebastian's shirt as he choked violently. "What?!" He jumped up, dabbing frantically at the stains. "Have you lost your mind? Where did you hear that insane rumor? Alexander? Engaged? You're joking, right?"
###Chapter 461

"That's exactly why I need you to ask him!" Cassandra circled the mahogany table, gripping Sebastian's arm with both hands. She gave it an insistent shake. "It's such a simple favor. Just casually bring it up when you see him. Can't you do this tiny thing for me?"

Honestly, the request itself wasn't outrageous. But where had she even heard such ridiculous gossip?

Sebastian's nose wrinkled in distaste as he studied his sister. "Since when do you believe every absurd rumor? Weren't you the one who swore Alexander was completely devoted to you? Have you actually seen him with another woman? Knowing you, you've probably scared off every female within a ten-mile radius of him." He paused, tapping his chin thoughtfully. "Honestly, if you told me he was secretly into men, I'd probably believe that faster. Wait—do you think his mysterious fiancé is actually some guy?"

He delivered this outrageous theory with complete seriousness, as if it were the most logical conclusion.

Cassandra's small fist connected with his shoulder with surprising force. "You idiot! You're the one who's clearly obsessed with men! Just ask him already! Why are you making this so difficult?"

"Ow! Fine, I'll ask!" Sebastian yelped, rubbing his sore arm. "They say blood is thicker than water, but clearly romance trumps sibling bonds. If I ever came out, I'd be the most fabulous member of this family!"

Seeing her fist rear back for another strike, he hastily raised his hands in surrender. "Alright, alright! My dearest Cassandra, I'll do it! Mercy, please!"

Satisfied, she lowered her hand but narrowed her eyes warningly. "You promised. Don't forget."

As she turned to leave, a thought struck her. She spun back around. "Oh, and when you set up the meeting, text me the time and place immediately. I'm coming too!"

Sebastian sighed. "Friendly advice? You should stay home."

"Why?" Her lower lip jutted out in an instant pout.

It had been weeks since she'd last seen Alexander. After their dramatic confrontation that day, their only contact had been two brief phone calls—both initiated by her. She'd been waiting for him to come crawling back first, but as days stretched into weeks, her patience had worn thin.

Fine. She'd admit it—she missed him terribly. The heart wants what it wants, and hers had chosen Alexander Kensington. But this engagement rumor needed to be squashed immediately. She needed to hear him deny it to her face.

Sebastian adopted his rare serious expression. "Think about it. How awkward would it be if you asked him directly? True or not, do you really think he'd give you an honest answer with you staring him down?"

"Why wouldn't he?"

"Then why don't you just call and ask him yourself?"

That single sentence rendered her speechless. Cassandra worried her bottom lip between her teeth, conflicting emotions playing across her face. "Just... just listen to me. Don't go. Some conversations are better between men." Nobody understood Cassandra's fiery temperament better than her brother, but he also knew Alexander's reserved nature.

If Alexander truly was hiding something, Cassandra's confrontational approach would only make him retreat further.

"Fine, I won't go," she finally conceded, though every fiber of her being rebelled against the decision. The truth mattered more than her pride. "But you have to swear you'll get me real answers."

"I promise!" Sebastian nodded vigorously, eager to end the conversation before she changed her mind.

Though unsatisfied, Cassandra knew this was her best option. The burning need for confirmation made her wish she could eavesdrop on their entire conversation. "And I mean every detail! If it's true, I want names, dates, everything!"

"Yes, yes!" He made shooing motions toward the door.

Only after the door closed behind her did Sebastian finally exhale. Leaning against the wall, he replayed the bizarre conversation. The more he thought about it, the stranger the situation became.

Setting aside their families' close ties—or Cassandra's obvious feelings—if Alexander were truly engaged, their entire social circle would be buzzing about it. There'd been zero signs of any romantic involvement, and suddenly an engagement? Who could possibly have captured Alexander Kensington's heart?

Now this was a mystery worth solving. Sebastian grinned, already planning his approach. This promised to be entertaining.
###Chapter 462

At first, Sebastian Winslow assumed arranging a meeting with Alexander Kensington would be simple.

He never anticipated being turned down flat.

Rejected? Him?

"I understand you're swamped, but surely you can carve out thirty minutes? Any slot from noon till evening works for me—I'll adjust my schedule!" Sebastian offered generously.

Alexander didn't even glance up from his planner. "Not possible."

"That can't be right. Tomorrow at noon?" Sebastian refused to believe the CEO's calendar was completely full.

"Prior engagement with Seraphina—booked three weeks ago."

"Tomorrow night then?"

"Dinner with Mr. Wellington at The Grand Pavilion."

"The day after?"

"Regional branch audits."

"Two days later?" Sebastian pressed.

Alexander snapped his planner shut. "Give it up. My next fortnight is wall-to-wall commitments. There's literally no opening for you."

A heavy silence followed. Then, plaintively: "Not even a lunch break? I could bring takeout to your office—we'll talk while you eat!"

"No. I'm eating right now, and you're cutting into that time. Speak now or never."

This wasn't phone conversation material. Face-to-face was essential—Alexander would never reveal anything substantive over a call.

"Fine. I'm coming to Celestia Tower now. I'll camp in your lobby until you finish work. You do eat dinner, don't you?" Sebastian grabbed his blazer mid-sentence.

"Family dinner at home. I'm leaving promptly at six." Alexander checked his Patek Philippe. "Time's up—board meeting in ninety seconds. Goodbye."

"Wait, you can't just—" The dial tone cut him off.

Was the man truly that busy? The Winslow conglomerate might pale next to Celestia Group's empire, but Sebastian still managed meal breaks.

This had to be deliberate avoidance. Alexander clearly suspected his motives.

The suspicion only fueled Sebastian's determination.

"Clear my afternoon," he barked at his assistant while striding toward the elevators. "All of it. Emergencies only."

"But sir, your 3PM with Ms. Sterling—"

"Reschedule!" The elevator doors swallowed him whole.

Nothing mattered more than uncovering Alexander's secrets. Not today.
###Chapter 463

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across Alexander Kensington's office as he buried himself in paperwork. Year-end reports from DR Holdings' subsidiaries, financial statements, and personnel evaluations piled high on his desk.

He wasn't making excuses—the workload was genuinely overwhelming.

Normally, Alexander would take his time with these tasks, even if it meant working through New Year's Eve. But now, everything had changed.

Now, he had Evelyn.

Every signed document brought him closer to going home to her.

The clock struck seven when Alexander finally emerged from his last meeting. His polished Oxfords clicked against the marble floor as he strode toward his office, signing documents Harrison handed him along the way.

Just as he reached for the doorknob, a figure blocked his path.

"Mr. Kensington! Surely you have time for me now?"

Alexander's jaw tightened at the sight of Sebastian Winslow. His icy glare clearly conveyed: Personal space violation.

His secretary cleared her throat. "Mr. Winslow insisted he had an appointment, sir. He's been waiting three hours."

Sebastian checked his Rolex with theatrical precision. "Three hours, forty-nine minutes, and twelve seconds, darling." He blew an exaggerated kiss toward the flustered secretary.

Alexander's frown deepened.

"Stop harassing my staff." He brushed past Sebastian into the office.

The Winslow heir trailed behind, undeterred. "Harassment? I'm providing essential workplace hydration! Women are like roses—they need regular admiration to thrive." He gestured toward Alexander's stone-faced expression. "Your glacial demeanor will make this entire office wilt. Tragic, really."

Between sentences, Sebastian released waves of his signature cologne—Eternal Bloom—and winked at passing female employees.

Though not as classically handsome as Alexander, Sebastian possessed an approachable charm. His almond-shaped eyes sparkled with mischief, and his tailored Brioni suit screamed old money.

Alexander yanked the blinds shut.

Signing the final document, he dismissed Harrison with a nod and reached for his overcoat.

Sebastian perked up. "Leaving? Perfect! Let's grab dinner—my treat."

"Going home." Alexander stabbed the elevator button.

Sebastian slipped in just before the doors closed. "Home? How domestic. What's the rush? Not like you're seven years old with a curfew." The elevator descended. "I know this fantastic new place at The Canopy—"

"No."

The doors opened to the underground garage. Alexander marched toward his Summit Trailhawk, Sebastian dogging his steps.

Harrison raised an eyebrow at their unexpected passenger. "Sir?"

"I said I'm going home." Alexander glared at Sebastian through the rearview mirror.

Sebastian buckled up cheerfully. "And I'm coming with! Consider it a house call."

"No dinner prepared for guests."

Sebastian's smile faltered. "I—I'll survive. Since you're 'too busy,' we'll talk during the ride." He leaned forward conspiratorially. "It's about that Veridian City merger..."

Alexander's grip tightened on the steering wheel as Harrison pulled out of the garage. The battle of wills had only begun.
###Chapter 464

Sebastian was relentless, and Alexander could practically see the gears turning in his head. He didn’t bother addressing it.

Instead, he turned to Harrison. "Drive."

The moment the engine roared to life, Sebastian caught on. He barely managed to shut the door before the car pulled away.

Opportunities like this didn’t come often. Without hesitation, Sebastian abandoned his own car in the underground parking lot.

This was his chance. He needed to choose his words carefully—too direct, and Alexander would shut him down before he even got an answer.

But before he could even form a coherent thought, Alexander spoke first.

"Did Cassandra send you?"

Sebastian’s jaw nearly hit the floor. How the hell—?

"You’re not subtle," Alexander said dryly, not even glancing his way. "It’s written all over your face."

Sebastian swallowed hard. Okay, so he can’t actually read minds. But how did he—?

"I know why you’re here," Alexander continued, his tone sharper now. "So let’s skip the pointless questions."

Sebastian stiffened. This isn’t how this was supposed to go. He’s terrifying. I haven’t even said anything yet!

"W-Well…" Sebastian stammered, blinking rapidly as if that would somehow reset the conversation. "Is it true?"

If Alexander already knew what he was going to ask, then—

"Yes," Alexander said flatly. Then, after a beat, "And no."

Sebastian’s brain short-circuited. What kind of answer is that?

"I’m not engaged," Alexander clarified. "I’m married."

The words hit Sebastian like a freight train.

Holy sh—

His mind raced. Who the hell would Alexander Kensington marry? Unless—no. No way. He can’t be serious.

Sebastian couldn’t help himself. "Who is she?"

Alexander turned his head slowly, fixing him with an unreadable stare. The silence stretched, thick and suffocating.

Sebastian’s throat went dry.

"You… can’t tell me?" he ventured weakly, gulping.
###Chapter 465

"You wouldn't know her," Alexander said.

Sebastian nearly swore out loud. What the hell? That's not an answer!

But if she was someone Sebastian didn’t recognize, she probably wasn’t from their elite circle. He might not know every eligible bachelor, but he certainly knew every eligible woman among the upper echelons.

Sebastian wasn’t boasting—he could list them all: who was stunning, who had a temper, who possessed extraordinary talent.

Alexander claimed Sebastian didn’t know her. Did that mean she wasn’t part of their world?

What was her background, then? A commoner? Impossible. The Kensingtons were one of the most powerful families in the city. They would never allow their heir to marry beneath his station.

"Even if I don’t know her, she must have a name, right?" Sebastian scoffed. "And tell me, will your family really accept some nobody? Don’t tell me you’ve fallen for a Cinderella story. Wake up, Alex. Fairy tales are for little girls. You can’t seriously believe in that nonsense."

Alexander shot him a cold glare, silencing him momentarily. But Sebastian couldn’t resist pressing further. "Forget my sister for a second. Think about your family—your legacy. Do you really think they’ll let some ordinary girl become a Kensington?"

"She’s not ordinary."

To Alexander, Evelyn was anything but ordinary. She was extraordinary. Ordinary? The word didn’t even belong in the same sentence as her.

Before Sebastian could argue, Alexander cut in, "Besides, I don’t need a political marriage to secure the business. And as for my family—I’m the one marrying her. Their approval isn’t required."

Sebastian wanted to scream. Someone record this! The great Alexander Kensington, reduced to a lovesick fool!

But he couldn’t. Not with his sister’s reputation and Alexander’s influence at stake. He never imagined the ruthless CEO could be this naive.

"That’s not the point," Sebastian insisted. "Our world doesn’t work like that. There are expectations—pressures. Sooner or later, reality will catch up to you. Even if you love her, when the backlash comes—"

"What does any of that have to do with you?" Alexander’s icy tone shut him down.

Sebastian clamped his mouth shut, feeling like an intrusive gossip. He turned to stare out the window, frustration simmering.

His mind raced, trying to figure out who this mystery woman could be. He glanced back at Alexander, but the man’s expression was unreadable—focused, almost eager.

Is he… looking forward to something?

Then it hit him. Alexander had been rushing home every night, refusing dinners and drinks. He’d even said he hadn’t prepared for Sebastian to join him.

"Wait—are you already living with her?"

Alexander didn’t confirm, but the slight shift in his expression was all the answer Sebastian needed.

"Holy hell. I never pegged you for the type, Alex!"

Alexander’s sharp glare could have cut glass. Sebastian recoiled, raising his hands. "Slip of the tongue! I just never thought the legendary bachelor would shack up with someone. Now I have to meet her. Harrison, step on it! I need to see this woman for myself."
###Chapter 466

Sebastian Winslow had completely forgotten about his sister's infatuation with Alexander Kensington. His sole focus now was catching a glimpse of Alexander's mysterious fiancée.

Dominic Reeves could only shake his head at Sebastian's antics. Alexander didn't even spare him a glance.

This moment had been inevitable ever since Alexander publicly acknowledged Evelyn Carter's identity at the Hawthorne family banquet.

Still, there was a sense of relief in finally having their relationship out in the open. It was only a matter of time before the world knew.

As the car rolled up to the gates of Crestview Heights, Alexander ordered Harrison, "Pull over here."

Sebastian frowned. "Why are we stopping?"

Then, Alexander's cold voice cut through the air. "Get out."

Sebastian blinked. "Huh?" He glanced around, confused.

Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto him. "You. Out."

Sebastian scoffed. "Excuse me?" Being kicked out like this was beyond humiliating. His car was still parked at Celestia Group’s headquarters—how was he supposed to get back?

And after coming this far? No way was he leaving without seeing the woman who had captured Alexander’s heart.

Only a fool would comply.

Sebastian planted himself firmly in his seat, legs splayed defiantly. "Not happening."

"Out. Now." Alexander's tone darkened, his eyes narrowing dangerously.

Sebastian gripped the door handle and the seat, refusing to budge. "Nope. I’m seeing your fiancée today. You can’t make me leave. Absolutely not."

"Harrison." Alexander’s patience had run out.

Harrison had anticipated this. Without hesitation, he unbuckled his seatbelt and moved toward Sebastian.

Sebastian tensed. "W-What are you doing?" His grip on the door loosened slightly.

With a quick warning, Harrison yanked the door open. Sebastian nearly tumbled out.

"This—this is assault! I’ll sue you!" Sebastian jabbed a finger at Harrison before turning pleading eyes to Alexander. "We’ve been friends for years! Practically brothers! You’ll have to introduce us eventually—why not now? Kicking me out like this is just—"

Before he could finish, Harrison hauled him out of the car.

Sebastian wanted to vanish on the spot. Never in his life had he been manhandled like this. Even if no one else was around, the security guards had witnessed everything.

Humiliating.

Harrison set him down and shut the door. Sebastian lunged forward, but Harrison blocked him effortlessly.

"Mr. Winslow," Harrison said calmly, "please don’t make this difficult."

Sebastian knew better than to push it. Harrison might look like a stoic statue, but he was trained in combat. Sebastian stood no chance.

And honestly? Harrison wouldn’t even need to break a sweat.
###Chapter 467

Sebastian Winslow could only stand frozen as the sleek black car disappeared through the gilded gates of Crestview Heights. The security here was notoriously impenetrable—state-of-the-art surveillance, biometric scanners, and guards who took their jobs far too seriously.

Unless you were a resident or escorted by one, you weren’t getting in.

And the guards? They didn’t recognize Sebastian. No amount of charm, persuasion, or thinly veiled threats made a difference. But Sebastian wasn’t the type to back down. Not when Alexander Kensington was acting so suspiciously.

What kind of woman could make Alex act like this?

The mystery gnawed at him. If he didn’t find out tonight, he’d never sleep.

After a quick scan of the perimeter, Sebastian zeroed in on the wrought-iron fence. It wasn’t that high. He smirked, slipping into the shadows of a nearby oak.

Easy.

He waited, counted to thirty, then doubled back. One last glance around—no guards in sight.

He lunged for the railing.

The second his fingers made contact, blinding floodlights seared his vision. A deafening alarm blared through the night.

"INTRUDER ALERT! INTRUDER ALERT!"

Sebastian recoiled, hissing as his retinas burned. The shrill siren drilled into his skull.

Damn it.

He dropped back to the pavement, shielding his eyes. Just as suddenly, the lights dimmed, the alarm cut off, and silence reclaimed the night.

Sebastian exhaled sharply.

Okay. So climbing’s out.

He glared up at the fence, arms crossed.

"Alex, you absolute traitor," he muttered. "Since when do you lock your friends out? Some fancy security system won’t stop me. Just you wait."

Pulling out his phone, he dialed the first name on his list.

Ten minutes later, he strolled through the front gates like he owned the place. The guards eyed him warily—no doubt recognizing him from the security feed—but a resident’s clearance was a resident’s clearance.

Sebastian knew exactly where Alexander lived. He’d been there before. But tonight? No way Alex would let him in the front door.

So he took the scenic route.

By the time he reached the sprawling Kensington estate, his lungs burned.

"Who the hell needs this much land?" he wheezed, bracing his hands on his knees.

But he wasn’t giving up. Not when he was this close.

Instead of the front door, he circled to the back. The garden was lush, overgrown in just the right places—perfect cover.

He backed up, took a running leap—

ZAP.

A jolt of electricity shot through him. His muscles locked. He hit the ground hard, limbs twitching uncontrollably.

Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me.

"Mr. Winslow?"

A familiar face loomed above him. Harrison, Alexander’s ever-loyal butler, looked equal parts horrified and amused.

Sebastian tried to speak. His jaw wouldn’t cooperate.

All he could do was blink.

This was a terrible idea.
###Chapter 468

The crisp night air was shattered by a sudden yelp as Sebastian Winslow hit the ground with a thud. His limbs splayed out like a starfish, fingers twitching involuntarily.

Harrison Kensington blinked in disbelief. "How the hell did you get here? Did you—" His gaze flicked to the garden wall, and realization dawned.

Crestview Heights wasn’t just any gated community. Beyond the standard security, Alexander Kensington had installed his own defenses. The ivy-covered walls? Electrified. Not enough to kill, but more than enough to leave an intruder paralyzed for a good ten minutes.

And Sebastian, the idiot, had tried to climb it.

Alexander’s voice crackled through Harrison’s earpiece, dry as dust. "Bring him inside."

Harrison sighed. "Yes, sir."

Sebastian groaned, his limbs still uncooperative. Harrison hauled him up like a sack of potatoes, ignoring the pathetic whimper that escaped him.

The warmth of the foyer was a stark contrast to the biting cold outside. Harrison moved toward the plush sofa, but Alexander’s voice cut in again.

"Not there. He’ll ruin the leather."

Without hesitation, Harrison dropped Sebastian onto the marble floor.

Sebastian wheezed, glaring up at Alexander with all the venom he could muster. His fingers twitched, the lingering numbness making speech difficult. "Y-You—heartless b*stard!"

Alexander arched a brow. "Harrison, toss him back outside."

Sebastian’s eyes widened. "N-No! I take it back! J-Just—ignore me!" His words slurred, the aftereffects of the shock still rattling his system.

Alexander waved Harrison off, then crouched down, studying Sebastian with detached amusement. "It’s past midnight. Shouldn’t you be drunk in a bar somewhere? Or did you really think scaling my wall was a good idea?"

Sebastian scowled. "Julian Whitmore let me in through the gate! Had to call in a favor because of you!"

Alexander smirked. "And yet, here you are—on my floor, looking like a electrocuted raccoon."

Sebastian groaned. This was not how tonight was supposed to go.
###Chapter 469

The icy silence from Alexander Kensington didn’t deter Sebastian Winslow. Besides, the warmth of Alexander’s penthouse was too inviting to resist.

Sebastian’s body had finally stopped trembling from the electric shock, and he managed to push himself off the floor, collapsing onto the plush sofa with a satisfied sigh.

Alexander shot him a glare, but Sebastian merely grinned, settling deeper into the cushions. “Relax, will you? You’ve already thrown me out of your car and zapped me. I’m not complaining.”

He leaned forward, mischief glinting in his eyes. “All I want is to meet your fiancée. Why the secrecy? Is she so hideous you’re ashamed to—”

The sudden frost in Alexander’s expression made him swallow the rest of his words.

Sebastian raised his hands in surrender. “Fine, fine. I’m just trying to help. The cat’s out of the bag anyway—no point hiding her now. If you’re serious about marrying her, wouldn’t it be better if I met her first? Before my sister does?”

He watched Alexander closely, hoping logic would crack that stubborn resolve.

“You know how Cassandra is,” Sebastian pressed. “She’s been glued to your side for years, scaring off every woman who dared come near you. If she finds out you’re engaged—and not just in some business arrangement—she’ll lose it.”

The thought made him shudder. Cassandra wasn’t just stubborn—she was volatile. If she felt betrayed, there was no telling what she’d do.

That was why Sebastian needed to see this mystery woman for himself. If she wasn’t right for Alexander, he’d do everything to break them apart. But if she was… well, someone had to warn her about the storm coming her way.

“I’ve never led Cassandra on,” Alexander said coldly. “Everyone knows that.”

Sebastian nodded vigorously. “Of course! Even my parents get it. But you know how she is—logic doesn’t apply to her. If it did, she’d have given up years ago.”

His gaze flickered toward the hallway. “Aren’t you worried about what might happen to the woman you’re so desperate to protect?”

Alexander’s expression darkened. The memory of Laurentia flashed in his mind—the fear, the helplessness. Even though Evelyn had escaped unharmed, the mere thought of what could have happened made his blood run cold.

He would never let that happen again.

His voice was steel. “Keep Cassandra in line. If she so much as looks at Evelyn the wrong way, I won’t care whose sister she is. There will be consequences.”

The threat hung in the air, sharp and unyielding.

Sebastian froze. He’d seen Alexander angry before, but this was different. This wasn’t just irritation—it was lethal.

For the first time, Sebastian understood. This wasn’t some political marriage or fleeting infatuation. Alexander was in love.

And that terrified him.

Who was this Evelyn Carter, who had thawed Alexander’s frozen heart?

Sebastian had seen countless women try—beauties, heiresses, geniuses—all failing miserably.

What made her different?
###Chapter 470

Sebastian had been waiting for what felt like hours, yet Alexander’s fiancée remained conspicuously absent. He had gone through so much trouble just to get inside Alexander’s home—so where was she? Weren’t they supposed to be living together?

His eyes darted around the lavish penthouse, searching for any trace of a woman’s presence—a stray hairpin, a forgotten scarf, anything. But the space was immaculate, almost sterile in its perfection.

Just then, Alexander rose from his seat and casually rolled up his sleeves. "Make yourself at home," he said, already moving toward the kitchen.

Sebastian blinked. "Wait—where are you going? And how exactly am I supposed to make myself at home? Can I… look around?" He hesitated, testing the boundaries. If Alexander let him wander, he might finally catch a glimpse of the mysterious woman—or at least a photo of them together.

Alexander didn’t even glance back. "Feel free. Unless you’re afraid of triggering the security system again."

Sebastian stiffened, the memory of the electric shock still fresh. He rubbed his arm unconsciously. Who the hell installs an electric fence inside their own home?

Deciding self-preservation was more important than curiosity, he trailed after Alexander—only to freeze in the kitchen doorway.

Alexander was tying an apron around his waist.

Sebastian’s jaw dropped. "Y-You—" His voice cracked. This was more shocking than the damn fence. If he weren’t terrified of Alexander’s retaliation—or worse, his family’s wrath—he would’ve whipped out his phone and immortalized this moment for the world to see.

Alexander Kensington, CEO of Celestia Group, heir to one of the country’s most powerful families… wearing an apron and about to cook.

The internet would explode.

Alas, he valued his life too much.

Alexander smirked, as if reading his thoughts. "Since you’re just standing there, make yourself useful. Grab the tomatoes from the second compartment of the fridge."

Snapping out of his daze, Sebastian obeyed—only to gape at the contents of the refrigerator. It was stocked like a gourmet chef’s pantry: fresh produce, premium cuts of meat, exotic spices, even rare supplements.

This wasn’t the fridge of a man who ordered takeout every night.

Handing over the tomatoes, Sebastian couldn’t resist. "Did your private chef quit? Or did you finally scare him off?"

Alexander’s knife flashed as he began dicing. "I prefer cooking for myself."

Sebastian stared. Since when?

The mystery of Alexander’s fiancée was now rivaled by an even bigger one: Since when does Alexander Kensington cook?
###Chapter 471

Alexander Kensington held a kitchen knife, his brow furrowed in thought before he finally murmured, "She only enjoys my cooking."

Sebastian Winslow stayed silent, forced to witness this rare display of affection from the usually stoic man.

He took another bite of the cucumber he'd snatched from the fridge, leaning casually against the counter as he watched Alexander move around the kitchen with practiced ease. The precision of his cuts, the efficiency of his movements—it was clear this wasn’t his first time.

Sebastian exhaled sharply, shaking his head in disbelief. Alexander Kensington, cooking? The idea was almost laughable. What kind of sorcery is this? He’d never lift a finger for anyone else.

"My curiosity about her is skyrocketing," Sebastian mused, trying to pry more out of him without crossing a line. "What kind of woman could possibly make you this devoted?"

Alexander didn’t even glance up as he tossed the ingredients into the sizzling pan. "People like you wouldn’t understand," he said flatly, flipping the spatula with effortless grace.

Sebastian scoffed. People like me? As if he hadn’t had his fair share of relationships. He rolled his eyes and turned his attention elsewhere—until—

"Holy hell!"

The cucumber slipped from his grip as he stumbled back, nearly crashing into Alexander. The sudden movement made Alexander jerk, nearly dropping the pan before he turned and smacked Sebastian’s forehead with the spatula. "Have you lost your mind?"

"There’s a ghost in your house!" Sebastian hissed, pointing a trembling finger toward the kitchen entrance.

Alexander followed his gaze—and froze.

Standing in the doorway was a figure drenched in mud, her long hair plastered to her face, water dripping onto the floor. She looked like something straight out of a horror film.

For a split second, even Alexander was stunned. Then recognition flickered in his eyes.

Evelyn.

He quickly turned off the stove and moved toward her, his voice softening. "What happened?"

"Who is he?" Evelyn demanded, her sharp gaze locking onto Sebastian, her finger accusatory.

Sebastian paled. Oh god, the ghost is pointing at me. Is this how I die?

"A nobody," Alexander answered dismissively, his attention solely on Evelyn. "Are you hurt?"

"I’m fine," she muttered, pushing her wet hair back. "I was collecting samples in the valley and slipped. Then it started raining." She grimaced, shifting uncomfortably. "I need to shower."

Alexander nodded, brushing a thumb over her muddy cheek. "Go. Don’t catch a cold."

Evelyn gave Sebastian one last suspicious glance before disappearing upstairs.

Sebastian exhaled shakily, pressing a hand to his chest. "Was that—?"

"You met her earlier," Alexander said dryly, returning to the stove. "And you screamed like a child. You scared her."

Sebastian gaped. Scared her? That woman had looked ready to murder him.

Alexander Kensington was full of surprises—but this one took the cake.
###Chapter 472

Sebastian Winslow's eyes widened comically. I'm the one who should be terrified here!

Dominic Reeves finished cooking in record time. The aroma of garlic butter shrimp, filet mignon, sautéed asparagus, and creamy wild mushroom soup filled the air. A decadent chocolate mousse waited in the fridge, making Sebastian's stomach growl with envy.

He had shamelessly lingered this long—no way was he leaving without tasting the feast. Grabbing plates, he set the table with exaggerated helpfulness, already reaching for a fork when Dominic smacked his hand away. "I told you, this isn't yours."

"There's enough here to feed an army! You two can't possibly finish it all," Sebastian argued, undeterred. "Wasting food is a sin. Consider me your personal garbage disposal." He lunged for the steak.

"Not happening." Dominic blocked him effortlessly, swatting him aside like an annoying insect.

Sebastian's greatest talent? Sheer audacity. They wrestled over the platter until he triumphantly speared a slice of beef—

"Dominic, my car's acting up again." A melodic voice floated down the staircase. "Could you have Harrison take it to the shop tomorrow?"

"Take mine," Dominic replied without hesitation.

Evelyn Carter descended with lazy grace, damp hair curling at her shoulders. "No thanks. Your car screams arrogant billionaire. I'll call a cab."

Dominic intercepted her with a towel, draping it over her head. "Let Harrison drive you. Cabs are unreliable." His fingers gently scrunched her hair. "You never dry it properly."

"Too much effort." She flicked the strands aside—then froze, noticing Sebastian mid-bite, gaping at her. Her nose wrinkled. "Why is he still here?"

Sebastian's soul left his body.

One moment, he was dazzled by this ethereal vision; the next, her blunt dismissal shattered the illusion. He, the charming socialite who charmed everyone effortlessly, had been reduced to an unwelcome pest. Worse? Dominic actually nodded. "You're right. I'll kick him out."

Listen to this betrayal! Sebastian internally wailed. Since when does Dominic take orders?

Salvation came when Evelyn sighed. "Let him stay. He's your... acquaintance."

Bless her angelic heart.

Dominic's lip curled. "He's not. And he'll inhale half the food. You'll go hungry."

Sebastian choked. A glutton?! The table groaned under enough dishes to cater a wedding. "I eat like a bird!" he lied, pressing a hand to his heart. "Besides, gazing upon such radiance is nourishment enough. Who needs steak when beauty like this exists?" He shot Evelyn a smoldering look, eyelashes fluttering.
###Chapter 473

Sebastian Winslow thought himself utterly charming, yet Evelyn Carter's expression remained unreadable.

She turned to Alexander Kensington with a thoughtful glance. "I think... you should ask him to leave."

"What?" This was Sebastian's first major rejection. He blinked in disbelief. "No! Wait, gorgeous, I swear I don't eat much. Actually, I won't eat at all! You can't be this cruel, Alex. Think of our friendship—"

"Will you leave on your own, or should Harrison escort you out?" Alexander arched a brow.

"Absolutely not!" The memory of being carried out twice by Harrison made his ears burn. If it happened again, he'd never live it down. Desperate, he blurted, "Darling future sister-in-law! I came bearing a wedding gift. Isn't it rude to kick out a guest like this?"

"Wedding gift?" Evelyn eyed Alexander skeptically.

Alexander cleared his throat and placed a shrimp on her plate. "Indeed. Now that we're officially together, we should plan the wedding soon. Don't you agree, sweetheart?"

Sebastian shuddered at the endearment.

Evelyn understood instantly. News of their relationship must have spread after their return from the Hawthorne estate. She'd braced herself for this moment—going public no longer unsettled her.

"Where's this gift, then?" She extended a hand toward Sebastian.

He faltered. "Well, I rushed over, so..."

"Yet you claimed you came specifically to deliver it?" Evelyn took an elegant sip of soup, amused. This was her first time meeting one of Alexander's inner circle besides Harrison. The novelty intrigued her.

"Right! But I only heard the news en route. I needed confirmation before bringing anything!" He hastily added, "But don't worry—I'll make it grand. You'll adore it!"

He thumped his chest for emphasis, determined to stay. Her earlier kitchen appearance had stunned him—damp hair clinging to her shoulders, that avocado-green dress hugging her curves. Now, freshly showered, her laughter carried a hint of floral perfume. Playful yet decisive, she was unlike any woman he'd met. Alexander had unearthed a gem.

"Promise we'll love it?" She tilted her head.

"Guaranteed." Women adored jewelry and designer bags. A hefty budget would suffice.

"And if we don't?"

Sebastian glanced at Alexander, who remained silent, granting her full control.
###Chapter 474

"If this doesn't meet your expectations, I'll gift you the commercial complex in Montclair Heights!" Sebastian Winslow ground out between clenched teeth. Evelyn Carter considered his offer. Though she didn't understand the value of that property nor had any use for it, she decided to play along with his wager. "Deal," she agreed with a nod.

Sebastian visibly relaxed at her acceptance. Adjusting his position, he ventured cautiously, "Then... might I stay for dinner?"

"Absolutely! We always welcome guests warmly," Evelyn assured him with a perfectly gracious smile that didn't reach her eyes.

The hypocrisy nearly choked Sebastian. Hadn't this same woman threatened to throw him out moments ago? That sweet smile hid the soul of a demoness!

Having secured his dinner invitation, Sebastian regained his usual cheerful demeanor. Between bites, he attempted conversation. "We've been talking so long, yet I don't know how to properly address you, my lovely hostess."

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Alexander Kensington before answering, "Mrs. Kensington will suffice."

With their wedding approaching, the title was appropriate - and conveniently avoided giving Sebastian her actual name. 'This woman is as cunning as a fox,' he thought grimly.

Undeterred, Sebastian pressed on. "No, I meant your given name. I'm Sebastian Winslow - delighted to make your acquaintance. And you are...?"

His eager expression would have melted most women. Evelyn merely arched an eyebrow. "Mr. Winslow, don't you find it rather improper to ask a married woman's name in front of her husband?"

With that diplomatic deflection, she elegantly ended the conversation.

Sebastian nearly choked on his wine. 'Since when is asking a name considered scandalous?' He opened his mouth to protest but caught Alexander's warning glare. Swallowing his words, he changed tactics. "How did you two meet then?"

This was his true curiosity - how had this mysterious woman breached Cassandra's years-long siege of Alexander's heart? Fate worked in mysterious ways indeed.

Evelyn's gaze turned thoughtful. 'Was it during that competition mishap? Or when I sought his help years prior?' Before she could answer, Alexander interjected, "We go way back," then fixed Sebastian with an exasperated look. "Finished interrogating us? Leave if you are."

"Not at all!" Sebastian protested, hastily stuffing his mouth with food as proof. His mind raced - Cassandra would skin him alive if he returned empty-handed. He needed one more attempt.

Just as he drew breath to speak, Harrison entered urgently, his expression grave. "Mr. Kensington."
###Chapter 475

Alexander Kensington noticed the gravity in Harrison's expression and the hesitation in his voice. Something was clearly wrong.

He glanced at Evelyn Carter and Sebastian Winslow before rising from the table. Moving a few steps away, he lowered his voice. "What is it?"

Harrison whispered urgently, his words making Alexander's expression darken. Without meaning to, Alexander's gaze flickered toward Evelyn.

That single look was enough to make Evelyn's stomach drop. She didn’t need him to say a word—she already knew something terrible had happened.

"Understood." Alexander gave a curt nod before returning to the dining table, leaving Harrison standing stiffly in place.

Evelyn looked up at him, her fork hovering midair. Across from her, Sebastian remained blissfully unaware, too engrossed in devouring the meal Alexander had prepared. The man had the palate of a food critic, yet none of the social awareness.

Alexander’s eyes lingered on Sebastian for a brief moment before settling on Evelyn. His voice was steady, but the weight behind it was unmistakable.

"There was a fire at Willowbrook Apartments earlier."

Evelyn blinked. "Okay." She waited for him to continue, but then realization struck.

Willowbrook Apartments? That name—

"Isn’t that… where Bella lives?" Her voice wavered as the memory surfaced. She had dropped Isabella Thornton off there twice before. The complex was just a short distance from their office.

Alexander confirmed it with a nod.

Evelyn shot to her feet, her chair scraping against the floor. "Then Bella—"

"The entire building was engulfed. Most residents were taken to Mercy General. We’re still gathering details."

Harrison had received the news first and immediately relayed it to him.

"I need to go there!" Evelyn gasped, already turning toward the door, but Alexander caught her wrist.

"The firefighters and paramedics are handling it. They’re professionals. Rushing there won’t help—you’ll only get in the way. Stay calm. Harrison’s tracking updates. The moment we hear about Bella, we’ll know."

His reasoning was sound, but logic did little to ease the panic clawing at Evelyn’s chest.

In all her years at DR Holdings, Isabella had been her only true friend. The woman had defended her against Dominic Reeves’ cruelty, stayed late working on projects with her, and treated her like family.

How could she not panic?

Yet Alexander’s words grounded her. She glanced down at her loungewear—hardly appropriate for a crisis scene. Swallowing hard, she forced a nod.

"Fine. I’ll change quickly. If there’s any news—any—we go immediately." Her voice trembled despite her effort to steady it.

"Don’t worry. I’m right here." Alexander squeezed her hand, his grip firm.

Evelyn hurried upstairs, her pulse erratic. Behind her, Alexander exhaled quietly before turning back to the table—where Sebastian sat frozen, spoon halfway to his mouth.

The man finally set it down. "Uh… you were talking about that rundown complex at Willowbrook? The one that caught fire?"

"Yes."

"That place is a hazard. The wiring’s ancient, and the city’s been meaning to tear it down for years. Not surprised it went up in flames, but…" He trailed off, studying Alexander’s face. "Your wife looked terrified. She doesn’t have family there, does she?"

Sebastian knew the area well. Only two kinds of people lived there—longtime residents scraping by or out-of-town tenants with nowhere better to go.

If Evelyn had ties to a place like that… well, it explained a few things.

Alexander’s silence was answer enough.
###Chapter 476

If her family lives there, they must not be well-off.

"No." Alexander shook his head. "It's her coworker."

"Coworker?" Sebastian widened his eyes in disbelief. That was the last thing he expected to hear. "But she was so... distressed."

Sebastian had seen how frantic Evelyn had been earlier—her panic had seemed like something only a family emergency could provoke. Yet it was just a coworker? Since when did workplace relationships run so deep?

"They're close friends," Alexander explained, sensing Sebastian's confusion.

Sebastian gave an impressed nod. "She's a damn good friend, then."

Alexander shot him an exasperated look before his tone turned serious again. "You really can’t stay any longer. Harrison can’t drive you back, so you’ll have to take one of the cars. Go pick one from the garage."

Out of everything they'd discussed tonight, this was the best news Sebastian had heard. "Perfect! I’m on it." He grinned, already moving toward the door. But as he passed Alexander, he paused, mischief flickering in his eyes. "One last question."

Alexander arched a brow. "What now?"

Sebastian glanced up the stairs first, ensuring Evelyn wasn’t within earshot, then leaned in. "What’s your wife’s last name?"

Before Alexander could react, Sebastian raised his hands defensively. "Look, you don’t want me calling her ‘gorgeous’ or ‘goddess’ every time I see her, right? Not that I’d mind, but then you can’t accuse me of flirting."

Alexander exhaled sharply, resisting the urge to shove him out the door.

Evelyn’s surname wasn’t exactly a secret. Their marriage announcement would be plastered across every tabloid soon enough.

"Carter," he said flatly.

"Got it!" Sebastian flashed a grin and a thumbs-up before sauntering off to the garage. Moments later, the engine of a sleek black sedan roared to life, and he sped off into the night. Rubbing his stomach contentedly, he decided tonight had been a win. He’d met Evelyn, learned her last name, and—most shockingly—survived a meal cooked by Alexander Kensington himself. Life, for once, felt generous.

Still, as he drove, his mind circled back to that surname. Carter. It didn’t ring any bells among the elite circles he knew. Could she really be from an ordinary background?

Upstairs, Evelyn had changed into comfortable clothes and descended to find the living room quieter. Sebastian’s absence didn’t surprise her—staying would’ve been stranger.

"How is she?" she asked immediately, her fingers twisting the hem of her sweater.

"The rescue team’s wrapping up. All the injured were taken to Mercy General. Identities are still being confirmed—it’s chaotic. But we can go now if you want."

Relief and urgency surged through her. "Let’s go."
###Chapter 477

The fire had erupted in the dead of night, consuming the entire apartment building in flames. Most residents had been asleep when disaster struck, leaving countless injured in its wake. Mercy General Hospital was overwhelmed, its halls echoing with the cries of the wounded as doctors and nurses worked tirelessly through the chaos.

Evelyn moved through the crowded lobby with Alexander Kensington at her side, while Harrison cleared a path ahead. It didn’t take long for them to find Sophia Grant.

Compared to the other victims, Sophia’s injuries were minor—a few burns on her arm and cheek, scrapes on her knees and ankles from her desperate escape. But her mother… her mother hadn’t been so lucky.

Sophia stood outside the operating room, tears streaming down her face as she waited for news.

"Bella!" Evelyn called out, hurrying toward her.

Sophia turned, her eyes lighting up with desperate hope. "Evelyn! Evelyn, please—my mom, she’s—"

"It’s going to be okay," Evelyn reassured her, though the uncertainty of the situation weighed heavily on her heart. She examined Sophia quickly, relieved to see her mostly unharmed. "Thank goodness you’re safe. Your mother will pull through."

Sophia shook her head, her voice breaking. "She—she woke me up. The fire was everywhere. A beam fell, and she—she pushed me out of the way. It’s my fault. If I had woken up faster—"

Evelyn and Alexander exchanged a glance. Sophia was in shock, her words fragmented, her body trembling.

The operation dragged on, and though Alexander could have insisted Evelyn go home to rest, he didn’t. Instead, he sent Harrison for food and drinks, though none of them had the stomach for it. The hospital was a nightmare—people screaming, others silently mourning, some already lost.

Evelyn’s chest ached at the suffering around her.

Then, the operating room doors swung open.

A doctor stepped out, removing his mask. Sophia lunged forward before he could speak. "Doctor! My mom—she’s okay, right? The surgery was successful?"

The doctor hesitated, then sighed. "I’m sorry. We did everything we could, but—"

"No!" Sophia staggered back, shaking her head violently. "No, that’s not possible! She has to be okay!"

"Her injuries were too severe. She lost too much blood."

A nurse wheeled out the hospital bed, a white sheet draped over the still figure beneath. Sophia stood frozen, her breath coming in ragged gasps.

Evelyn felt the blood drain from her face. Her hands trembled.

Sophia took a step forward, then another, her fingers twitching toward the sheet. But she couldn’t bring herself to lift it. Harrison moved silently beside her and pulled it back.

The sight of her mother’s pale, lifeless face shattered Sophia completely.

"Mom? MOM!" Her scream tore through the hallway, raw and broken.

Evelyn’s head throbbed violently. Something about Sophia’s anguish triggered a flood of fragmented memories—images, voices, pain. Her vision blurred, her knees nearly buckling under the weight of it.

Her skull felt like it was splitting open.

And then—darkness.
###Chapter 478

"Evelyn, Evelyn..." Alexander's voice cut through the haze. His sharp eyes had been tracking her every movement, and strong arms caught her just as her knees buckled.

The world tilted dangerously as darkness threatened to swallow Evelyn whole.

Across the room, Sophia's wails filled the sterile hospital air, her grief too all-consuming to notice Evelyn's collapse.

"Harrison," Alexander commanded with controlled urgency, "attend to Ms. Grant."

With a silent nod, Harrison moved to Sophia's side, his steady hands bracing her shaking shoulders.

Alexander swept Evelyn into his arms, his long strides eating up the corridor. "We need a doctor! She's unconscious!"

"You murdered your parents!"

"It's all your fault!"

"Why do you get to live when they're dead? You're cursed!"

"Daddy! Mommy! Please don't go! No—"

The voices swirled around Evelyn like toxic smoke. Familiar yet foreign. The visions came in fractured pieces - distorted faces, shattering glass, flames licking at bloodied features. The scenes pulsed at the edges of her consciousness, always just beyond comprehension.

"Daddy! Mommy! Stay with me—"

"Ah!" Evelyn jolted upright, her scream tearing through the white room. The clinical brightness of the hospital ceiling burned her retinas, washing away the crimson nightmare. Her chest heaved as cold sweat trickled down her temples.

"You're awake!" Alexander's voice snapped her back to reality. His face hovered inches away, stormy eyes dark with concern. "Nightmares?"

The familiar planes of his face anchored her. Evelyn managed a weak nod, her throat raw as desert sand. "Water..."

Alexander pressed a glass to her lips before she finished speaking. She drank greedily, the cool liquid soothing her parched throat.

"More?" he asked when she came up for air. Evelyn shook her head, collapsing back onto the pillows. Fragments of the dream still danced behind her eyelids - terrifying yet strangely nostalgic, like half-remembered childhood trauma.

"The doctor said you collapsed from shock," Alexander murmured, his fingers gently carding through her damp hair. "Any pain? Dizziness?"

"Just... tired." Evelyn swallowed hard before remembering. "Sophia—is she—?"

"Harrison's with her. The nurses moved her mother to the mortuary. Funeral arrangements will begin soon." Alexander's steady voice provided unexpected comfort. At least Sophia wouldn't face this horror alone.

Evelyn exhaled shakily. "I came to support her, and ended up being the patient. How pathetic—"

"Stop." Alexander tucked the crisp hospital blankets around her with surprising tenderness. "Sophia understands. Right now, focus on resting. The doctors want to monitor you overnight. If all's well, we leave tomorrow."

His hand lingered on her shoulder, an uncharacteristic gesture that spoke volumes. For the first time since waking, Evelyn felt the tension leave her body. The nightmares could wait. Right now, Alexander's silent vigil was all the security she needed.
###Chapter 479

Evelyn didn't argue with him. Resting here was the sensible choice—the night had grown too late for travel.

Yet sleep refused to come.

Every time her eyelids fluttered shut, the nightmares clawed their way back. The screams. The blood. The suffocating dread. Her fingers tightened around Alexander's wrist. "Stay. Talk to me."

His thumb brushed her knuckles. "About what?"

"Anything." She exhaled, sinking deeper into the pillows. "Tell me something real. Something about you."

A chuckle rumbled in his chest. "There's nothing remarkable about me."

Evelyn arched a brow. Alexander Kensington—the man who'd turned corporate empires into chessboards—claiming his life was ordinary? "Try again."

"Fine." He stretched his legs, the mattress dipping under his weight. "What do you want to know?"

"Your family." She propped herself up on one elbow. "We're getting married. Shouldn't I meet them?"

A shadow flickered across his face. "You will. But they're irrelevant."

"Irrelevant?" The word tasted bitter. "They're your blood."

"Blood means nothing when it's poisoned." His voice stayed light, but his eyes turned glacial. "Imagine growing up with relatives who sent assassins for your birthday. Who framed you for crimes before you could spell your own name."

Her breath hitched.

The Kensington dynasty's brutality was legendary, but this—this was personal. A childhood woven with betrayal. A boy learning to dodge knives instead of catch baseballs.

"You survived," she whispered.

"I adapted." His fingers traced her jawline. "But you? You'll never need to. Not while I'm breathing."

Evelyn pressed his palm to her cheek. His touch was warm. Alive. A shield against the dark.

Alexander watched her eyelids grow heavy, her breathing steady. Only when she'd drifted off did his smile fade.

Because in her dreams, she still called for ghosts.

And ghosts, he knew, were the hardest enemies to kill.
###Chapter 480

The memory struck him like lightning. Her parents had perished in a plane crash when she was just a child. She shouldn’t remember much—she’d been too young, and she hadn’t even been on that flight.

Was it grief haunting her now?

When she returned to the Hawthorne family, she hadn’t shown any overwhelming longing for her parents. So why had she collapsed today? Had the sight of Sophia’s injured mother triggered something buried deep inside her?

She was more fragile than he’d realized.

"S—Something happened!" The man gasped, ducking into a cluttered, dimly lit room. Dust coated every surface, and the only light came from thin slivers of moonlight cutting through the darkness. His fingers trembled as he dialed the number.

"Why are you panicking? I thought you said you could handle this!" The voice on the other end was distorted, mechanical—unnatural. But the irritation was unmistakable.

"I didn’t expect the fire to get so out of control! That building was packed with people!" His breath came in ragged bursts, his entire body shaking.

He’d assumed the place would be nearly empty at this hour. Most of the windows had been dark. But when the flames erupted, so did the screams. The bodies carried out afterward—he could still hear the wailing.

"You idiot!" The voice snarled. "I told you to start a small fire—just enough to scare them! Not burn the whole damn place down! Do you have a death wish?"

"I—I was just following orders! You’re the one who told me to do it!" His voice cracked. He wasn’t the mastermind. He wasn’t the one who should pay.

A cold laugh echoed through the receiver. "Oh? Do you have proof of that?"

"You think the police will believe you? We’ve never even met in person. Everything between us is just calls and messages—easy to fake."

The man’s blood ran cold.

He’d thought this would be like the other small jobs—petty theft, minor vandalism. But this? This was something else entirely.

"I—"

"Stop panicking," the voice cut in, eerily calm now. "Tell me—did anyone see you?"

He swallowed hard, licking his dry lips. "No. I don’t think so."

"Don’t think. Be sure. That place was an old dump—no security cameras. As long as no one spotted you, they’ll blame it on faulty wiring. Old buildings like that? It happens all the time."

The words soothed him slightly. Maybe it would be fine.

"Exactly! It was just bad wiring! Nothing to do with me!"

"Good," the voice purred. "But just in case, you should leave town for a while. I’ve transferred enough money to last you. And don’t try to contact me again—this number’s done."

"Wait—!"

The line went dead before he could protest.
###Chapter 481

Evelyn Carter had taken leave to recover from her injuries and to arrange her mother’s funeral.

The fire had sent shockwaves through Veridian City. The buildings, though old and crumbling, had still housed residents. Seven lives were lost, nine were critically injured, and twenty-three suffered minor injuries. The tragedy had drawn the attention of local authorities, who not only extended condolences but launched a strict investigation into the cause of the blaze.

The narrow alleys lacked surveillance cameras, and with the fire breaking out at night while most were asleep, no witnesses could pinpoint its origin. By the time anyone noticed, the flames had already engulfed the area.

Initial speculation pointed to faulty wiring, sparking public outrage. Many blamed the government for neglecting maintenance and renovations in these aging structures.

The incident triggered a chain reaction. Authorities conducted sweeping inspections across relevant departments and initiated repairs in other old neighborhoods. News of the fire dominated headlines for days.

Evelyn couldn’t bear to watch the reports. Having witnessed the disaster firsthand, each mention twisted her stomach. She turned off the television with a heavy sigh. Sophia Grant was on leave, and Evelyn hadn’t stepped into the lab in three days. Her mind was blank, devoid of inspiration. She knew she shouldn’t let emotions derail her work—especially with the Olivella Soap project needing progress—but she couldn’t help it.

"The company will send someone to pay respects at Sophia’s mother’s funeral," Alexander Kensington said.

Working from home, he had barely left Evelyn’s side since the incident. Though the doctors had assured him she only needed rest, his concern manifested in quiet vigilance. Modern technology made remote work seamless, but some meetings had to be postponed.

"Okay," Evelyn nodded. "Is Harrison still with her?" She hadn’t seen him in days.

Alexander confirmed he’d sent him to support Sophia. It was the right call. Sophia had lived with her mother, and now, alone, grief could consume her. Harrison, though reserved, was the perfect companion—capable, unobtrusive, and unlikely to push her when she needed silence.

"Sophia’s apartment burned down," Alexander added. "I had Harrison take her to one of my smaller properties."

"Thank you." Gratitude warmed Evelyn’s voice. He had done so much for her already.

"You’re being ridiculous," he murmured, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "What do you want to eat today?"

She shook her head. Appetite had deserted her.

"No appetite? Then something sour to wake it up? Or sweet, to boost your mood?" He paused, considering. "Hunter’s stew?"

Evelyn couldn’t help but smile at the determination in his eyes. Before she could respond, he cut in, "Don’t say no."

"I wasn’t going to. It sounds perfect." How could she refuse when he was trying so hard?

Satisfied, Alexander brushed a kiss against her cheek. "Wait for me."

He headed to the kitchen, but his phone rang before he could start. Recognizing his assistant’s number, he answered. "Yes?"
###Chapter 482

The phone buzzed on Alexander Kensington's desk, interrupting his concentration. His assistant, Sebastian Wright, stood nervously by the door, clutching a tablet.

"Sir, there's something you should see."

Alexander glanced up, his piercing blue eyes narrowing. "What is it?"

Sebastian hesitated before stepping forward. "Reporters captured photos of you at Mercy General Hospital. They're... circulating."

Alexander leaned back in his chair, unfazed. "So? I was there. It's public property."

Sebastian swallowed hard. "That's not the issue, sir. The photos show you with a woman. And the way you two were standing—it looks... intimate."

A beat of silence.

Alexander's expression darkened. He reached for the tablet, swiping through the images. There he was, standing close to Evelyn Carter in the hospital corridor, his hand resting lightly on her arm. The angle made it seem far more personal than it had been.

Sebastian cleared his throat. "Several media outlets reached out for comment before publishing. They wanted your approval."

Alexander scoffed, tossing the tablet onto the desk. "As if they need my permission. They're just covering their backs."

Across town, Cassandra Winslow stormed into her brother Sebastian Winslow's office, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

"You've been avoiding me," she accused, slamming her palms onto his desk.

Sebastian jumped, nearly spilling his coffee. "What? No, I haven't."

Cassandra crossed her arms. "Don't lie. I know you met with Alexander. What aren't you telling me?"

Sebastian wiped his hands on a napkin, avoiding her gaze. "It's nothing. Just business."

"Business?" Cassandra scoffed. She grabbed his tie, yanking him forward. "Try again."

Sebastian choked, his face turning red. "Cass—let go—"

Employees in the open office space froze, watching the scene unfold.

Cassandra ignored them, dragging him toward his private office. "We're talking. Now."

Sebastian stumbled after her, gasping for air. "You're insane!"

She shoved him inside and slammed the door. "Start talking."

Sebastian loosened his tie, glaring. "Fine! You want the truth? Alexander's involved with Evelyn Carter. And it's complicated."

Cassandra's eyes flashed. "How complicated?"

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "The kind that could ruin everything."

A tense silence settled between them.

Cassandra clenched her fists. "Then we fix it."

Sebastian shook his head. "You don't understand. This isn't something we can just—"

She cut him off. "Watch me."

Without another word, she turned and stormed out, leaving Sebastian staring after her, dread pooling in his gut.
###Chapter 483

The fire had drawn a crowd, but not everyone was focused on the flames.

Sebastian Winslow was drowning in regret. Why had he been so stubborn about that durian-flavored cake and milk tea? Even if he coughed it all up now, it was too late.

At work or at home, Cassandra Winslow hounded him relentlessly, demanding answers.

At first, he had hoped to avoid her for a day or two, unwilling to tell her the truth. He feared his sister wouldn’t be able to handle the pressure. But when she followed him into the men’s restroom, he knew there was no escape.

“T-This is the men’s room. You’re in the wrong place,” Sebastian said with a forced smile, pointing at the sign.

Cassandra scoffed. “Wrong place? If you, my dear brother, belong here, then so do I.”

“What kind of logic is that? I’m your brother.” He turned toward the sink, his expression stern, as if preparing to lecture her.

“Oh, so you do remember you’re my brother. What kind of brother makes a promise and then avoids me like the plague?” Cassandra’s voice was sharp with frustration.

She knew Sebastian had met with Alexander Kensington, so she had been chasing him down relentlessly—his office, his home, even the bar. But every time she arrived, he was already gone. It was obvious he was dodging her.

And the more he avoided her, the angrier she became.

“I’m not avoiding you,” Sebastian lied, shaking water from his hands with exaggerated motions.

Cassandra narrowed her eyes. When he tried to slip past her, she seized his tie and yanked him back.

“Running away again?”

“N-No!” he sputtered. “I was just getting a tissue to wipe the water off you!”

“How considerate,” she deadpanned. “But I can handle it myself.”

She turned on her heel, marching toward his office—without letting go of his tie.

Sebastian had no choice but to stumble after her. He couldn’t exactly wrestle free, not with his sister dragging him like a misbehaving dog. His face flushed red as employees stared.

“Cassandra, let go. We can talk properly. I can’t breathe.”

The whispers around them only fueled his irritation. Finally, he snapped, “Cassandra Winslow!”

She stopped abruptly, spinning to face him, her eyes blazing.

Sebastian gasped for air, wrenching his tie loose and loosening the knot. He glared at her. “You want answers? Fine. I’ll tell you. Follow me.”

Without waiting, he stormed into his office.

At the door, he turned back, jaw tight. “Get in.”

Cassandra hesitated for only a second before lifting her chin defiantly. “Oh, I’m coming in. What’s there to be afraid of?”
###Chapter 484

She trailed behind him as Sebastian slammed the office door with a deafening crash. Two seconds later, he yanked it open again, glaring at the stunned employees outside.

"Don't you have work to do?" His voice was a thunderous growl. "If you're this free, consider staying late tonight!"

The employees froze.

Not a single pair of eyes dared to lift. Heads bowed, they scrambled to look busy—or at least pretended to.

Bang!

The door shut again, the sound making everyone flinch. The tension was palpable. When the boss was in a mood like this, stepping out of line was suicide.

And Sebastian was definitely in a mood.

His dignity had been shredded, dragged around like some unruly pet. Worse? It was his sister doing the dragging. He couldn’t yell at her. Couldn’t discipline her. The frustration was eating him alive.

At this point, secrecy was pointless.

With a sharp inhale, he lit a cigarette and exhaled smoke in a slow, deliberate stream. "Fine. Yes, I met with Alexander."

A pause.

"Or rather, I tried to. His fiancée was the one who showed up."

He chose the term carefully. Fiancée. Official. Respectable.

Cassandra’s hands clenched into fists, nails biting into her palms. She forced herself to stay still, but her voice was pure venom.

"That witch?" The words were gritted out between her teeth.

Sebastian didn’t doubt that if Evelyn Carter were standing in front of them right now, his sister would tear her apart with her bare hands.

"Don’t call her that," he said automatically. "They’re in love."

Evelyn was poised, elegant—nothing like the scheming seductress Cassandra was painting her to be.

But Cassandra’s mind was already made up.

Witch. Homewrecker. Manipulator.

"In love?" She let out a sharp, disbelieving laugh. "She stole him from me when I wasn’t looking!" Her voice rose, frantic. "Tell me everything. Her name. What she looks like. Where she’s from. What she does. When did she sink her claws into him?"

Sebastian took another long drag, exhaling smoke rings before speaking quietly.

"Cassandra. Enough."

Her eyes widened, as if he’d just slapped her.

"Excuse me?"

"I mean it." His tone was firm. "Listen to yourself. Do you even hear what you’re saying? Your man? Since when was Alexander ever yours? He’s always seen you as a sister. You know that. You just refuse to accept it."

He rarely spoke this bluntly with her.

But now that he’d started, he couldn’t stop.

"It doesn’t matter who she is. If he wanted you, he would’ve made a move years ago. He wouldn’t have waited for someone else to come along."

The truth was harsh.

And Cassandra hated it.

She’d been rejected before. Over and over. But she’d never given up, convinced that eventually, he’d see her the way she saw him. That she was the only one who truly belonged by his side.

No one else measured up.

So she refused to hear a word of it.

Her hands flew to her ears, fingers pressing hard as if she could block out his voice. "Sebastian, have you lost your mind? I’m your sister! Your blood! If you won’t help me, who will?" Her voice turned suspicious. "What did she offer you? Did she enchant you too?"

A bitter laugh escaped her.

"You still claim she’s not a witch? Then how else could she have you wrapped around her finger? You’d choose a stranger over your own flesh and blood?"

The more she spoke, the more convinced she became.

That woman was a master manipulator. A predator.

And Cassandra would drag her down from whatever pedestal she’d climbed onto.
###Chapter 485

Sebastian's brow furrowed as he snapped, "Cassandra, have you lost your mind? I'm your brother. Your blood brother."

His words only fueled her rage.

"You're not my brother," Cassandra hissed, her voice trembling with fury. "If you were, you wouldn't be saying any of this. If you were, you'd tell me who that witch is!"

Her mind raced, conjuring images of every eligible woman in Veridia’s elite circles. The Winslows were respectable, though nowhere near the Kensingtons' stature. Still, she was beautiful, had graced magazine covers, and had known Alexander for years.

Why her?

"Stop guessing," Sebastian cut in sharply. "You don’t know her. I don’t even know her."

He exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples. "She’s probably not from any major family. Just some ordinary woman. And Alexander is obsessed with her. If you cross her, I won’t be able to save you from his wrath."

His warning was deadly serious.

Alexander Kensington had a reputation—cold, ruthless, untouchable. But Sebastian knew better. Beneath that icy exterior was a man who rarely lost his temper.

Unless pushed too far.

And Cassandra was sprinting toward that line.

"I don’t care if I know her or not," she spat. "Just tell me her name. Do you have a photo?"

Sebastian scoffed. "Do you really think Alexander would let me take one?"

She clenched her fists. "Then what does she do?"

"How would I know?" He stubbed out his cigarette, frustration simmering. "Listen, you’re a catch. There are plenty of men who’d kill to marry you. Why keep chasing a wall that won’t budge?"

Her glare was glacial. "There’s only one man in this world I want. Alexander Kensington."

Without another word, she stormed out, slamming the door behind her.

Sebastian sighed, watching her go.

Stubborn as hell.

Outside, Cassandra’s chest heaved with barely contained fury.

She had suspected.

But hearing it confirmed?

Alexander was engaged.

To someone else.

Her nails dug into her palms.

This isn’t over.
###Chapter 486

The years of longing had led to this moment—he was marrying someone else. Cassandra Winslow couldn't bear it. The world around her seemed to shatter.

Tears blurred her vision as she drove aimlessly through the streets of Veridian City. Before she knew it, she found herself outside the gates of the Prescott estate. She hadn’t driven all the way to Garnet Springs—the Prescotts owned multiple properties in the city.

"Adrienne..."

Cassandra sat in her car, clutching her phone, her voice trembling. The moment Adrienne Prescott heard the muffled sobs on the other end, her breath hitched. "Cass? What’s wrong? Talk to me."

"Are you... home?" Cassandra sniffled, realizing belatedly that she hadn’t even checked before showing up.

"Yes, of course. Where are you?"

"I’m—I’m at your gate." Her words were thick with tears.

Adrienne didn’t hesitate. The line went dead, and moments later, the heavy iron gates creaked open. Adrienne rushed out, her dark hair whipping in the wind as she scanned the driveway. Spotting Cassandra’s car, she hurried over.

The sight of her friend’s tear-streaked face made her chest tighten. "Cassandra..."

A broken sob escaped Cassandra as she stumbled out of the car and into Adrienne’s arms. "What do I do? Tell me what to do."

"Come inside first," Adrienne murmured, guiding her toward the warmth of the mansion.

The grand foyer was bathed in soft golden light, the faint scent of lavender and vanilla lingering in the air. It was a stark contrast to the storm raging inside Cassandra.

Adrienne motioned for the staff to bring tea and pastries before dismissing them with a wave. She settled beside Cassandra on the plush velvet sofa, taking her cold hands in hers. "Now, tell me everything."

Cassandra lifted her gaze, her lashes damp. The moment Adrienne saw the raw pain in her eyes, she knew.

"Let me guess," Adrienne said softly, brushing a tear from Cassandra’s cheek. "The only person who could wreck you like this... is Alexander Kensington."

The name alone made Cassandra flinch. Fresh tears spilled over, her silence more telling than any words.

Adrienne exhaled sharply, handing her a tissue. "Oh, darling. Who did this to you? Who made my fierce Cass crumble?"

But Cassandra couldn’t answer. The weight of her heartbreak was too heavy to put into words.
###Chapter 487

Adrienne didn’t coddle Cassandra or try to force her to stop crying. She let Cassandra sob until her tears ran dry before finally speaking.

“Ready to talk now?”

Cassandra wiped her nose with the tissue Adrienne handed her, her eyes still damp. “You know he’s about to get engaged, right? And I don’t even know who the woman is.”

Adrienne exhaled sharply. “That’s what this is about? Seriously?” She rolled her eyes. “I thought it was something major. He’s just getting engaged, not married. And even if he were married, divorce rates are sky-high these days. Why are you acting like this?”

No one had ever spoken to Cassandra like this—not her parents, who tiptoed around the subject, nor her brother Sebastian, who bluntly told her to move on. But Adrienne? Adrienne made it sound trivial. For a moment, Cassandra just stared at her, stunned.

“Is… is that really how it works?”

“Why wouldn’t it be?” Adrienne bent down, picking up two cups of fruit tea. She handed one to Cassandra and cradled the other in her hands, warming her fingers. “Cass, I’m not trying to be harsh, but look in the mirror. You’re a catch. Do you have any idea how many people are obsessed with you? Your fans, your movies—hell, half the city would kill to be with you.”

She took a sip of her tea before continuing. “You’re fearless. You love hard, you fight hard. That’s what I’ve always admired about you. But this?” She shook her head, sighing. “This isn’t you.”

Cassandra’s cheeks flushed. “I have been pursuing him,” she insisted, frustration creeping into her voice. “For years. You know that. But he’s always been indifferent. What else am I supposed to do?”

She had put in so much effort—more than most would. She’d clung to the hope that her persistence would eventually break through to him. And yet, here they were.

Adrienne arched a brow. “You call that pursuing?” She let out a disbelieving laugh. “Cass, be honest with yourself. What you’ve been doing isn’t pursuing—it’s waiting.”

Cassandra stiffened. Her grip on the cup tightened before she slammed it onto the coffee table with a sharp clink.

She shot to her feet—or tried to. Her legs, numb from sitting cross-legged for so long, buckled beneath her. She stumbled forward, crashing into Adrienne. Tea splashed everywhere, soaking both of them.

“Adrienne!” Cassandra snapped, though the effect was ruined by her unsteady stance. “I came to you because I thought you’d understand. But if you’re just going to mock me—”

Adrienne glanced down at her ruined blouse, unimpressed. “Get mad if you want. Truth hurts, doesn’t it? Fine. If you don’t want to hear it, I’ll stop.”

She turned toward the stairs, fully prepared to walk away.

Panic flared in Cassandra’s chest. She needed Adrienne—needed someone who wouldn’t sugarcoat things. Someone who’d actually help her figure this out.

“Wait!” She lunged forward, grabbing Adrienne’s wrist. “Don’t go. I didn’t mean it like that. I’m not angry—so why are you storming off?”

Adrienne paused, then turned back to face her. “So. Are you still mad?”
###Chapter 488

Cassandra Winslow pressed her lips together. "I'll stop being mad if you stop saying that."

Adrienne Prescott couldn't help but laugh as she reached out to pinch Cassandra's cheek. "You silly girl! Even if you were a puppy, you'd still be the most adorable one I've ever seen!"

"Stop it!" Cassandra stomped her foot like a petulant child.

"Fine, fine. No more teasing." Adrienne glanced down at the hand gripping her wrist. "Now, can you let go?"

"No. What if you try to escape?"

Adrienne arched a brow. "This is my house. Where exactly would I go? I just want to change out of these clothes. You got them dirty, and now you won’t even let me put on something clean."

Cassandra flushed and immediately released her.

Yet, Adrienne didn’t move. "Want to come with me? Your dress is ruined too. You can borrow something of mine."

Cassandra looked down at the stain on her blouse and sighed. Without protest, she followed Adrienne upstairs.

After changing, Adrienne handed Cassandra a fresh outfit. Once dressed, Adrienne gathered Cassandra’s hair and turned her toward the mirror. "See? Gorgeous."

Cassandra studied her reflection—her sparkling eyes, the faint flush on her cheeks. Even with puffy eyes from crying, she still looked delicate, almost ethereal. So why didn’t Alexander Kensington want her?

The thought made her eyes well up again.

Adrienne caught her chin, forcing Cassandra to meet her gaze in the mirror. "You’re stunning. So why the self-doubt?"

"I am pretty," Cassandra whispered. "Then why doesn’t he love me? What does he even like?"

"That’s your mistake." Adrienne’s grip tightened slightly.

Cassandra winced but didn’t pull away.

"You’re too focused on him," Adrienne said firmly. "You’ve placed yourself so low, he doesn’t even see you anymore."

Cassandra blinked, confusion flickering in her glassy eyes.

"Men love the chase," Adrienne continued. "But you? You’re practically delivering yourself to his doorstep, ready to cater to his every whim. What are you—his maid? His nanny?"

Each word stung. Cassandra’s frown deepened.

"I just wanted him to notice me."

"If you want him to notice you, stop groveling." Adrienne squeezed her hand. "Cassandra, chase your own happiness first."
###Chapter 489
At first, Cassandra was utterly baffled by Adrienne's words.

"What do you suggest I do?" Cassandra demanded. A flicker of defiance ignited within her, spreading like wildfire through her veins.

The confusion that had clouded her mind moments ago was dissipating.

"Cassandra, darling, you're radiant. The entire room holds its breath when you enter. You need to make him see you," Adrienne murmured, leaning so close her lips nearly brushed Cassandra's ear. Then, just as suddenly, she pulled back with a sharp inhale. "But—"

"But what?" Cassandra's pulse stuttered at the ominous pause.

"It's too late for that now!" Adrienne's voice turned icy. "You've poured everything into him, and he's grown indifferent. No matter what you do, you can't rewrite the narrative he's built about you in his mind. And let's not forget—you're not his only option anymore. Time isn't on your side. This strategy won't work."

With that, Adrienne released her and glided to the vanity, meticulously smoothing cream over her flawless hands. Adrienne's skincare ritual was legendary—her complexion luminous, her skin like satin.

Though Cassandra possessed striking beauty, Adrienne's ethereal glow outshone her in ways that stung.

Watching Adrienne's serene focus as she massaged the cream into her skin, Cassandra's patience frayed. "What am I supposed to do, then? You said marriage was reversible—that an engagement meant nothing! How is it suddenly too late?"

Adrienne turned, exhaling dramatically. "There is another way. But I doubt you'd have the spine for it."

"Spine? Who says I don't?" Cassandra's voice trembled with barely restrained fury. Nothing would stand between her and Alexander—not now, not ever.

"Oh?" Adrienne arched a brow, amusement dancing in her eyes. "Then why are you hesitating? Do you even grasp who Alexander is? The Kensington heir doesn't just marry—it's a political spectacle. Family approval isn't optional; it's mandatory."

For dynasties like theirs, matrimony was a calculated alliance, a power play. If Cassandra could sway the elders, victory would be hers.

Cassandra had listened intently—until Adrienne's words registered as hopelessly naive. She shook her head, lips curling in disdain. "Adrienne, you don't understand him. Or the Kensingtons."

"Enlighten me," Adrienne challenged.

"Your plan might work for lesser families, but not for Alex." Cassandra's gaze drifted, lost in memory. "Alex is the Kensington dynasty. He clawed his way to the top—no one pulls his strings, not even the so-called elders. Their opinions? Meaningless. That's what makes him untouchable."

As she spoke, reverence colored every word. Adrienne watched, bewildered.

She'd met Alexander twice—his beauty icy, his presence impenetrable. Even her polished greetings had earned nothing but indifference.

The Prescotts were no strangers to power plays. Adrienne had grown up navigating the venomous undercurrents of elite society. She knew survival demanded ruthlessness.

Her uncle Alistair had ruled their family with an iron fist. Her father, Gregory, held wealth and titles, yet bowed to Alistair's authority. And Adrienne? No matter how brilliant, she'd always be second to Julian.
###Chapter 490

Every decision required careful consideration of its consequences. Even Alistair Prescott, as the family patriarch, couldn't act recklessly. He had to weigh the opinions of his relatives before making any major moves. Adrienne Prescott had always assumed this was how all powerful families operated—until she discovered the astonishing exception.

The Kensington family functioned differently.

From what she'd heard, when Alexander Kensington set his mind to something, no one dared oppose him. No objections, no interference—just absolute freedom to pursue his desires. The realization made Adrienne's breath catch.

Wasn't this exactly what she'd secretly longed for her entire life?

"Adrienne? Adrienne!" Cassandra Winslow's voice finally pierced through her thoughts. Blinking, Adrienne focused on her friend's impatient expression. "You spaced out again. What's going through that head of yours?"

"Nothing important," Adrienne lied smoothly, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "So you're saying there's no way to be with him unless he initiates it?"

"Obviously!" Cassandra groaned, twisting the hem of her blouse between manicured fingers. "Do you think I'd be this frustrated otherwise?"

Adrienne bit her lip. Even she couldn't devise a solution to this dilemma. Choosing her words carefully, she tried another approach. "Tell me, what tangible proof do you have of his affection?"

Cassandra brightened immediately. "Oh, he's given me so many gifts! Designer handbags, couture dresses, jewelry worth a fortune—"

"That's not what I meant!" Adrienne cut her off with an exasperated wave. "I'm talking about physical intimacy. How many times have you kissed? Has he ever held you close? Have you two..." She lowered her voice conspiratorially, "...gone all the way?"

Cassandra's porcelain skin flushed scarlet. She swatted Adrienne's arm twice in rapid succession. "Adrienne Prescott! Since when do you talk like some tavern wench?"

This reaction shocked Adrienne more than the revelation itself. The prim and proper Cassandra Winslow—reduced to a blushing schoolgirl at the mere suggestion?

"I'm being practical!" Adrienne rubbed her stinging arm. "Don't tell me you've never even held hands!"

Cassandra's deepening blush confirmed everything.

Adrienne's eyebrows shot up. "But you've known each other since childhood! How is this possible?" A man resisting Cassandra's beauty and relentless pursuit? Unheard of.

"We—we held hands once!" Cassandra confessed in a rush, her gaze dropping to her lap. "Years ago, crossing Magnolia Avenue. I grabbed his hand from behind..."

Adrienne leaned forward, captivated.

"He didn't let go until we reached the other side." Cassandra's voice softened with remembered wonder. "For days afterward, I floated on air."

The wistfulness in her friend's tone made Adrienne's chest tighten. One fleeting moment of contact—that was all Cassandra had to treasure after years of devotion.

The realization settled like lead in Adrienne's stomach. Alexander Kensington wasn't just powerful.

He was dangerous.
###Chapter 491

Adrienne Prescott glared at Cassandra Winslow’s indifferent expression with barely concealed fury. "You never cease to amaze me. All these years, and you’ve been chasing after solitude?" The bitterness in her voice was palpable.

It was a cruel irony—one woman bold enough to pursue, the other daring enough to reject.

There were only two paths in love—either be merciless or walk away. To linger in uncertainty was a defeat, and Cassandra’s stubborn persistence only proved how much she had already lost.

"Let’s not dwell on that now," Adrienne said, waving a dismissive hand. "Tell me—do I still stand a chance?"

Cassandra tilted her head, studying her. "That depends. What do you truly want? His body or his heart?"

"Don’t be ridiculous!" Cassandra snapped, her brows knitting together. "I want all of him!"

Adrienne smirked. "The problem is, you don’t have either. So, if you had to choose—just one—what would it be?" She held up a finger, silencing Cassandra’s protest. "Be honest. Would you rather have him by your side forever, even if his heart belongs to another? Or would you prefer his love, knowing you can never truly be together?"

The question struck Cassandra like a physical blow. She had spent years chasing Alexander Kensington, convinced that if she just tried hard enough, he would eventually be hers—body and soul.

But Adrienne was right. Reality was far harsher.

After a long pause, Cassandra lifted her chin, resolve hardening in her eyes. "I want him physically. What good is love if I can’t have him beside me? That’s just torment. If I’m with him every day, he’ll learn to love me in time."

Adrienne nodded, a knowing smile playing on her lips. "I thought you’d say that."

"Then tell me—how do I make it happen?" Cassandra demanded.

Before Adrienne could answer, raised voices erupted from downstairs, loud enough to echo through the entire house.

The two women exchanged glances. Adrienne rose swiftly and moved toward the door. Cassandra hesitated only a second before following.

They reached the top of the staircase just in time to witness the scene unfolding in the grand living room below.

Two figures Cassandra recognized immediately—Adrienne’s parents. She had met them briefly before, always composed, always dignified.

But not today.

Joseph Prescott, usually so controlled, was gesturing wildly, his face flushed with anger. His wife, Genevieve Sinclair, stood rigid, her voice trembling with barely restrained fury.

"No," Genevieve said, her tone icy. "I will never agree to this."

Even in her rage, she was every inch the aristocrat—but the cracks in her composure were impossible to ignore.
###Chapter 493

"Now look what you've done!" Genevieve glared at Gregory with fiery intensity before swiftly ascending the stairs.

Cassandra followed Adrienne back to the room. She studied Adrienne's silent, shell-shocked expression and desperately wanted to comfort her, but words failed her. Instead, Cassandra lingered behind Adrienne, hoping her mere presence might offer some solace.

To her surprise, Adrienne turned and offered a strained smile—one that didn't reach her eyes. "Sorry you had to witness that," she murmured.

"Don't apologize!" Cassandra stepped forward and pulled Adrienne into a tight embrace, struck by the realization that her friend's situation was far more heartbreaking than her own. While Cassandra struggled with unrequited feelings, Adrienne was trapped between warring parents.

Gregory Prescott had a mistress and an illegitimate son. Worse, he was unapologetically patriarchal, determined to hand the family empire to his bastard son rather than share it with his own daughter—simply because she was a woman.

Gregory opened his mouth to continue the argument, but Genevieve had already disappeared upstairs. She knocked lightly on Adrienne's door, greeting them politely before stepping inside. The sight of Cassandra gave her pause—clearly, she hadn't expected company—but she recovered quickly with a gracious nod.

"Oh, hello, Cassandra."

"Good evening, Ms. Sinclair," Cassandra replied respectfully.

Genevieve acknowledged her before turning to Adrienne. She studied her daughter for a long moment before speaking. "Sweetheart, why don’t you go out with Cassandra?"

That hadn’t been her original intention upon entering, but seeing Cassandra had shifted her approach.

"It's freezing outside," Adrienne muttered, staring at the floor.

"True, winter’s settling in. Your father and I have been swamped with company matters, so we haven’t had time to take you shopping." Genevieve sighed, then pulled a sleek black card from her pocket and pressed it into Adrienne’s hand. "Since Cassandra’s here, why not pick out some new sweaters? And do let me know if there’s anything noteworthy in the boutiques—I haven’t had the chance to browse lately."

She spoke with practiced ease, as if their earlier argument had never happened.

Cassandra marveled at Genevieve’s composure. No wonder she manages the Prescott family’s affairs so effortlessly.

"I’ll grab some things for Dad too. He never updates his wardrobe."

Cassandra blinked in surprise. She’d expected tears, anger—anything but this eerie calm. Adrienne wasn’t just composed; she was thinking of her father.

Genevieve’s smile softened. "That’s a lovely idea. Get two extra scarves while you’re at it. And if the card runs low, just bill your father."

Adrienne smirked. "In that case, I might need to splurge."

"Go ahead." Genevieve gave her daughter’s shoulder an affectionate pat.

After gathering their coats, Cassandra trailed Adrienne downstairs. Gregory sat in the parlor, a cigarette dangling from his fingers. Adrienne bounded over and looped her arms around his neck.

"Dad, I’m buying you new clothes and scarves today. You’re reimbursing me if your card declines!"

Gregory chuckled, exhaling a plume of smoke. "Of course, darling. I’ll cover every cent."
###Chapter 494
"Then I'll be leaving. Goodbye, father!" Adrienne kissed her father's cheek and pulled Cassandra out of the house.

Cassandra was stunned. Her stomach twisted as she witnessed the bizarre scene. What's wrong with Adrienne? Was that entire performance scripted? It feels like we're trapped in some twisted soap opera!

Did they just forget their explosive argument the moment the curtain fell? How can Adrienne act so casually affectionate with that man after everything he said?

The two women settled into the car, the silence stretching between them like taffy. Cassandra gripped the steering wheel, her mind racing through unanswered questions. Nothing about this situation made sense.

Adrienne rummaged through her designer purse and produced a bag of candied fruit. With manicured nails, she tore it open and offered a piece to Cassandra, who shook her head without meeting her eyes. Shrugging, Adrienne popped the treat into her own mouth instead.

"Still puzzling over why I'd buy clothes for that man?" Adrienne's voice was disturbingly calm, as if discussing the weather. "Should I have thrown a tantrum? Screamed until my voice gave out? Maybe ripped my hair and clothes like some tragic heroine?"

Cassandra kept her eyes on the road.

"I learned young that tears solve nothing." Adrienne chewed methodically, her gaze fixed on the passing scenery. "Do you think hysterics would make him value me? See my worth?" She gave a bitter laugh. "It would only confirm his belief that I'm just some petty girl jealous of her half-brother."

Her jaw worked harder with each word, the dried fruit becoming her emotional punching bag. Cassandra glanced sideways, noticing the tension in Adrienne's delicate features.

"Adrienne..."

"Don't waste your pity." She waved a dismissive hand. "Every family has its skeletons. Mine just likes to dance in the daylight." The snack bag crinkled violently in her grip. "Remember when I asked if you wanted Alexander's body or his heart? My mother has the former. That other woman owns the latter."

The sudden shift caught Cassandra off guard, but the brutal truth in Adrienne's words resonated. She focused on navigating traffic while absorbing every syllable.

Adrienne rested her elbow against the window frame, watching the world blur past. "Men are predictable creatures," she murmured, more to herself than her companion. "The harder you cling, the faster they slip away. That woman didn't even need charm—just well-timed pheromones and my father's weakness."

A dark chuckle escaped her lips. "My mother got lucky. If that mistress came from better stock, I'd be the bastard instead." She turned sharply, her eyes glinting with something dangerous. "Silver linings, right?"

The engine hummed as the luxury car carried them away from the gilded cage of Prescott Manor, leaving unspoken truths hanging heavier than the designer bags at their feet.
###Chapter 495

Serena's words had slipped out casually, but they lingered in Cassandra's mind.

Like seeds scattered by the wind, they settled deep, taking root, sprouting, and soon, wild vines of thought twisted through her consciousness. The more she dwelled on it, the more sense it made.

Serena had lived through it—seen it unfold with her own eyes. Her clarity was undeniable, her emotions raw and unfiltered. And now, Cassandra felt the same unsettling truth settle into her bones.

This belongs to N?velDra/ma.Org.

"What now?" Cassandra asked, gripping the steering wheel.

"Now?" Serena grinned, flipping her hair over one shoulder. "We shop, obviously. I promised my father."

"Right." Cassandra exhaled, turning the car toward the gleaming expanse of the mall.

After days of suffocating gloom, Evelyn finally clawed her way out of the fog.

That nightmare had dredged up old wounds—ghosts from her childhood she’d rather forget. But she couldn’t afford to drown in the past.

She still had the Olivella soap to perfect, the aromatherapy blend for her grandfather. Promises were promises, and she intended to keep them.

Isabella was still away, leaving Evelyn to shoulder the lab’s workload alone. Without her assistant, every task felt twice as heavy. The staff tried, but they couldn’t read her mind like Isabella could.

Miscommunications piled up, forcing Evelyn to re-explain, redo, and refine.

Just when she thought she couldn’t juggle more, Serena announced her arrival.

A "business trip," she called it, but she’d phoned twice already, insisting on dinner.

Evelyn nearly refused—time was a luxury she didn’t have. But Serena had been there for her in Laurentia. She owed her this.

She called Alexander, letting him know she wouldn’t be home for dinner, then headed to the restaurant.

When she saw Serena, she barely recognized her.

A pristine white down jacket hugged her frame, paired with an oversized fur coat that screamed luxury. The moment she shrugged it off, the dress beneath left no room for imagination—snug, shimmering, and cut to highlight every curve.

Evelyn gaped.

So did half the restaurant.

Two striking women at one table? Heads turned. Whispers followed.

"Since when do you look like that?" Evelyn propped her chin on her hand, studying her friend with wide eyes. "You’re stunning."

Serena had always been statuesque—tall, with a frame that balanced strength and softness. But now? She was lethal.

Serena waved a hand, laughing. "Occupational hazard."

"Right, your job." Evelyn tapped her lips. "Modeling, wasn’t it?"

"Wasn’t it?" Serena gasped, mock-offended. "Evelyn Carter, did you forget?"

"Sorry, sorry!" Evelyn flagged down the waiter. "Let me make it up to you. Order whatever you want—my treat."

Serena stopped her. "No need. I can’t eat much before a show anyway."

"A show?" Evelyn blinked. "Is that why you’re here?"

Serena leaned in, eyes gleaming. "Exactly. And I need your help."
###Chapter 496

Evelyn was baffled. "Ask me about what? Would you like me to attend your performance?"

She said it half-jokingly, unsure how else to assist Serena. But the way Serena stared at her was odd—intense, almost pleading. "If you're free, of course! But that's not why I'm here. It's something else entirely."

"What is it?"

"I need your help creating a perfume," Serena leaned in, her eyes gleaming with excitement. "It's right up your alley!"

Evelyn blinked in disbelief. "You're joking, right? Your father is a legend in this field. Why come to me?"

"I knew you'd say that," Serena huffed, frustration flickering across her face. "But it's not that simple. Yes, my father is a master perfumer, but he doesn’t get what I want."

Evelyn nearly laughed. Her own father didn’t understand her?

"Don’t look at me like that! I’m serious!" Serena pouted, her usually poised demeanor slipping into something more childish. Despite her striking beauty, she had an endearing, almost naive charm.

Evelyn bit back a smile. "No, no, I’m not laughing. Explain it to me. Why doesn’t he understand?"

"Everything he makes for me is sweet, innocent—like I’m still a little girl. But I’m not! I could just buy from luxury brands, but we are the luxury brand. Wearing something mass-produced? That’s as embarrassing as showing up to a gala in the same dress as someone else!"

She clasped her hands together, resting her chin on them, her gaze locking onto Evelyn’s with desperate hope. "Please. I need something me—bold, sophisticated, unforgettable."

Evelyn arched a brow. "So, you’re saying your standards are… high?"

She was teasing, but the request wasn’t unheard of. Celebrities, socialites, even heiresses often commissioned bespoke scents from elite perfumers.

For them, money was irrelevant. The real currency was distinction—a way to stand out without saying a word. Once, it was designer labels and rare jewels. Now? Perfume had become the ultimate status symbol.

A signature scent wasn’t just fragrance—it was identity.

And yet, those clients always sought established names. Not someone like Evelyn, still carving her place in the industry.

"Of course my standards are high!" Serena scoffed. "Why else would I come to you? I think you get me. I want to be fierce. Unapologetic."

She blinked, suddenly earnest. "I’m not a child anymore."
###Chapter 497

Serena's antics made Evelyn chuckle. She understood perfectly—no matter how mature Serena pretended to be, in Harrison Whitaker's eyes, she would always remain his little girl. A master perfumer like Harrison would never craft a sultry, intoxicating fragrance for his own daughter. That would be practically encouraging her to seduce men.

Though legally an adult, Serena still had that rebellious streak, desperate to prove she wasn't a child anymore. She hated being treated like some innocent, sugar-coated darling.

"I get it. It's not impossible, but..." Evelyn paused, choosing her words carefully. "Right now just isn't a good time for me."

"What?" Serena's face fell. "What do you mean? I need it for the fashion show!"

Shaking her head, Evelyn shut her down firmly. "I'm swamped. Two urgent projects on my plate. Can't take on anything else at the moment. If you can wait, I'll try after wrapping these up. But if it's too late, you should find someone else." She was being brutally honest—her schedule was a nightmare.

"No! I don't want anyone else!" Serena insisted stubbornly. "It has to be you. You're the only one who truly gets me!" After a thoughtful pause, she added, "Fine, it's too soon now, but I still want you to create something exclusive for me. And don't worry—I'll pay top dollar! Just... help me after you finish your other work."

"Alright," Evelyn conceded. With Serena's persistence, there was no other answer.

As they talked, their food arrived. Evelyn's recent lack of appetite meant she'd ordered lightly, but Serena barely touched anything except her salad. This was odd—back in Laurentia, Serena had devoured cakes and steaks without hesitation. What changed?

"You used to inhale desserts and red meat. Since when did you turn into a health nut?" Evelyn asked, amused.

Serena sipped her lemon water before answering. "That was during my off-season. A little indulgence never hurt. But when I'm working? Strict diet only." She groaned dramatically. "Do you know how many hours I have to sweat in the gym to burn off one slice of cake? Absolute torture."

To Evelyn, depriving oneself of delicious food was the real crime. But Serena had no choice—her career demanded discipline. She had to maintain peak physical condition for the runway, to captivate every eye in the audience.

Evelyn studied her. The once-shy, carefree girl had truly grown up. Time had swept them both forward, each carving their own path.

"Speaking of which," Serena said, pushing away her half-finished salad, "remember Penelope?"

"Of course," Evelyn replied without hesitation.

"She finally gave up," Serena murmured, a strange mix of relief and melancholy in her voice. Despite everything, they had once been friends.

"Gave up what?" Evelyn frowned.

"On using Oliver to win Donovan back." Serena sighed. "I never thought she'd let go. For years, she clung to the idea of reuniting with him. And now? Just like that, she walks away."

"Maybe she finally saw reason," Evelyn offered lightly.

After years of obsession, exhaustion must have set in.

Serena scoffed, shaking her head. "No way. I've known Penelope forever. If she were capable of 'seeing reason,' she wouldn't have been so delusional to begin with." Her lips twisted bitterly. "I used to feel sorry for her—thought she genuinely missed Oliver. That's why I tried helping them reconnect. But after what she did to you? It's clear she never cared about him. He was just a pawn."

Evelyn leaned in. "Then why do you think she quit now?"
###Chapter 498

"I'm not certain how much Donovan offered her or what exactly was said, but eventually, Penelope gave up." Serena's voice took on a peculiar tone as she added, "Though afterward, she muttered something I couldn’t quite grasp."

"What was it?" Evelyn pressed, curiosity flickering in her eyes.

Serena frowned, trying to recall. "Something about... considering the consequences before becoming a stepmother. And that Donovan might not be the man I believed him to be. That’s the gist of it, anyway." She shook her head. "I couldn’t remember the exact words."

Evelyn blinked. "C–Consequences?"

"Oh, not for me!" Serena clarified quickly. "She meant you!"

"Me?!" Evelyn’s voice pitched higher in disbelief.

"Exactly! That’s why it was so bizarre. You’ve only met her once. Why would she fixate on you like that? As if you’re scheming to become Oliver’s stepmother." Serena scoffed. "Why on earth would she assume you’d even want to be with Donovan?"

"I have no idea!"

If Serena hadn’t brought it up, Evelyn would’ve nearly forgotten Donovan Blackwood even existed. Their paths had barely crossed, and she certainly had no interest in him.

Besides, after leaving Laurentia, Evelyn had assumed she’d only keep in touch with a handful of people—Serena, Harrison, and a few others she’d grown close to. The rest were irrelevant.

"That’s just weird," Serena muttered.

Evelyn nodded in agreement. "Completely. But then again, she’s clearly not thinking rationally. No sane person would use their own child to blackmail a man who doesn’t love them."

"You’re right about that." Serena sighed, shaking her head. The whole situation was strange, but at least she’d shared it with Evelyn. Besides, she knew Evelyn had a boyfriend. The idea of her and Donovan together was absurd.

"Speaking of which," Serena said, shifting the subject, "how are things with your man?"

The moment Alexander Kensington was mentioned, Evelyn’s thoughts drifted to his recent behavior—gentle, attentive, making sure she was always comfortable. Their relationship was no longer a secret, and the world knew they were together.

"We’re good," she replied, a soft smile playing on her lips. "Actually... we’re getting married soon."

"What?!" Serena’s eyes widened with excitement. "Does that mean I get to be your bridesmaid?"

Evelyn laughed. Serena was already planning ahead!

But the mention of bridesmaids made Evelyn’s heart flutter. When she’d first signed the marriage certificate, she hadn’t thought much about the wedding itself. Now, the anticipation bubbled inside her, brighter than ever.
###Chapter 499

After saying farewell to Serena, Evelyn headed to the renowned patisserie in Veridian City to purchase a box of buttery shortbread and two steaming cups of coffee. She carefully poured the coffee into insulated flasks to preserve their warmth until she reached home.

Dominic sat with one leg crossed over the other, engrossed in a book. His fingers deftly turned the pages while his other hand cradled an empty porcelain cup. The soft glow of the lamp highlighted the sharp angles of his face, where a few rebellious strands of hair framed his rimless glasses, lending him an air of refined intellect.

Though Dominic didn’t suffer from severe myopia, his slight astigmatism made reading without glasses a strain. It was a rare sight—him wearing them—and every time Evelyn caught a glimpse, her pulse quickened as if she were falling for him all over again.

The moment he heard the door, his gaze lifted, meeting hers. The warmth in his amber eyes melted the chill she’d carried in from outside. Her breath hitched.

This man is dangerous.

"You're back," he murmured, removing his glasses. The sharpness returned to his gaze, stripping away the scholarly softness. Evelyn quickly averted her eyes, slipping into her house slippers before approaching him. She plucked the empty cup from his hand. "You could’ve refilled this yourself, you know. Do I have to remind you to take care of yourself?"

She unscrewed the flask and pressed the fragrant coffee into his palm. "Here. I remembered your favorite blend."

A slow smirk curved his lips as he set aside his documents. He lifted the flask to his nose, inhaling the rich aroma before taking a sip. "How did you know I’d like this?"

"Please," she scoffed, though her cheeks burned. "I’m your wife. Did you think I wouldn’t notice?"

Over time, she’d learned his preferences—the way he liked his coffee strong but not bitter, the way he always reached for shortbread when working late. She’d been so focused on proving herself, on bridging the gap between them, that she’d forgotten to simply love him.

"Oh?" His arm snaked around her waist, pulling her into his lap with effortless grace. Not a single drop of coffee spilled.

"Exactly!" She squirmed, pressing her palms against his chest. "I’m freezing, and you’re like a furnace. You’ll catch a cold."

The winter air had seeped into her bones, but Dominic radiated warmth like a living hearth. His embrace chased away the lingering chill, his body heat seeping into hers.

"Perfect," he murmured, tightening his hold. "Now we balance each other out."

Evelyn exhaled, relaxing into him. "I ran into Serena today. She asked me to create a signature perfume for her."

Dominic nodded, his fingers tracing idle circles on her back. "That’s excellent. Just don’t overwork yourself."

"I told her I couldn’t start right away. If she really wants it, she’ll have to wait." She hesitated. "I never expected someone like her to commission me. I always thought custom fragrances were for industry legends."

His chuckle rumbled against her. "She asked you because you’re talented. Don’t sell yourself short."

Evelyn laughed. "It’s because we’re friends, and she’s being kind! Talent needs proof."

With a playful shove, she stood and retrieved the shortbread from its paper bag. "I got these for you. Since you somehow forgot to eat."

His eyes gleamed as he accepted the offering. "Remind me again why I married you?"

She smirked. "Because no one else puts up with you."

Dominic’s grin was slow, predatory. "Wrong. It’s because no one else gets me like you do."
###Chapter 500

Alexander Kensington set down his coffee cup with a soft clink, his piercing gaze locking onto Evelyn Carter. "You're unusually attentive today. What's on your mind?"

Evelyn blinked rapidly, her fingers tightening around her own mug. "Nonsense! I've just been... difficult lately." She traced the rim of her cup absently. "You've been bringing work home because of my moods. I thought you deserved something special."

A slow, knowing smile spread across Alexander's face. "Is that so?"

His eyes traveled deliberately down her frame - from her flushed cheeks to the delicate curve of her neck, over the smooth skin of her arms, finally resting on her loosely curled fingers. With deliberate slowness, he extended one finger to trace circles in her palm.

Evelyn snatched her hand back with a gasp. "Alexander!"

"Darling," he murmured, leaning closer, "there are far more... intimate ways to show your appreciation that don't involve spending money."

Evelyn's breath hitched as she studied his expression. Though she could have easily evaded his touch, something held her still - perhaps the warmth in his eyes, or the way his scent enveloped her.

When he pulled her closer, she didn't resist. Even as he loomed over her, she maintained eye contact, her voice barely above a whisper. "Tell me what you want."

In an instant, Alexander closed the distance between them, his lips claiming hers with possessive intensity. One hand tangled in her hair while the other pressed against the small of her back, eliminating any space between them.

'My everything,' Alexander thought fiercely.

It had been too long - between work demands and Evelyn's recent melancholy, they'd neglected this fundamental connection. "Alex..." Evelyn breathed when they finally parted.

"Hmm?" He nuzzled her neck, unwilling to break contact.

Evelyn swallowed hard. "Let's get married."

Alexander stilled, pulling back to search her face.

"I mean," she rushed to clarify, "let's skip the engagement and go straight to the wedding. I want everyone to know we belong together." When he remained silent, uncertainty flickered across her features. "Unless... you don't want to?"

With a growl, Alexander captured her earlobe between his teeth before whispering hotly against her skin, "Silly woman, how could you ever doubt that?"
