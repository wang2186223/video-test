###Chapter 1 

Los Angeles, Midsummer

At five in the morning, the sky was just beginning to lighten. Jenna Roland slipped out of bed with practiced quiet.

She tied her apron with ease and moved deftly in the cramped kitchen. The clinking of the spatula against the pan was barely audible—she didn’t want to wake her uncle’s family next door.

By six-thirty, steaming soy milk and freshly made pancakes were neatly arranged on the dining table.

Wiping sweat from her brow, Jenna pulled the household register from the drawer and tucked it carefully into her bag.

"Jenna, leaving so early?" Fiona Roland yawned as she emerged from the bedroom.

"Yes, I have some business to take care of." Jenna kept her head down and hurried toward the door.

Her e-bike cut through the morning light. With every block closer to the city hall, her heartbeat quickened.

"Jenna!"

The familiar voice made her brake sharply. She looked up to see Grandma Blanche waving at her from the steps of the building.

Beside the elderly woman stood a tall man in a crisp white shirt that gleamed blindingly under the sun.

Jenna took a deep breath, parked her bike, and approached them.

"This is my grandson, Ethan Roscente." Grandma Blanche beamed. "Vice President of HM Group."

The man turned. His sharp gaze swept over Jenna like a blade.

Her fingers tightened around the hem of her shirt. He was even taller than she’d imagined, his long legs outlined by tailored black trousers. An aura of unapproachable intensity radiated from him.

"Hello, Mr. Roscente." Jenna extended her hand, still flecked with flour from breakfast.

Ethan gave a slight nod, barely glancing at her.

"Go on inside and get your marriage license. I’ll wait in the car." Grandma Blanche patted Jenna’s shoulder with an encouraging smile.

As they entered the hall, Ethan suddenly stopped.

"Miss Roland." His voice was glacial. "Are you certain about this marriage?"

Jenna looked up. Sunlight slanted across his sharply defined features, casting half his face in shadow.

"I’m certain." Her voice was soft but unwavering.

Ten minutes later, Jenna clutched the freshly printed marriage certificate, feeling like she was in a dream.

"Take this." Ethan held out a black card. "Twenty thousand monthly. Ask if you need more."

Jenna stepped back. "No, Mr. Roscente, I couldn’t—"

"Don’t make me repeat myself." He shoved the card into her hand and walked away.

As the black Maybach pulled off, Jenna remained frozen on the sidewalk.

"That girl has a good heart. Must you always be so cold?" Grandma Blanche chided in the car.

Ethan loosened his tie with a scoff. "What kind of woman marries for money?"

"Nonsense!" The elderly woman smacked the seat in frustration. "She’s doing this to reclaim her parents’ orchard! That poor child’s brother is still hospitalized!"

Ethan glanced out the window. Jenna was pushing her e-bike into the distance, her slight frame almost translucent in the harsh sunlight.

"Time will tell," he said flatly.

"Stubborn boy!" Grandma Blanche glared. "In all my years, I’ve never misjudged a person!"

Ethan closed his eyes and said nothing more.

In the rearview mirror, the girl with the ponytail grew smaller until she disappeared into the morning traffic.
###Chapter 2

Jenna Roland rode her e-bike down the country lane, tires crunching over gravel. The orchard's iron gate stood ajar. She rode straight in and found Victor Roland working beneath an apple tree.

"Uncle." Jenna cut to the chase. "We need to talk."

Victor wiped sweat from his brow, hands still busy. "What's so urgent?"

Jenna pulled a red booklet from her bag and slapped it onto a crate of apples. "I'm married. According to the will, the orchard belongs to me now."

Victor's hand froze midair. He picked up the marriage certificate with suspicion. On the first page, a man with sharp features stared back—impeccable suit, eyes cold as ice.

"Jenna!" Victor snapped the booklet shut. "You'd play with marriage for a damn orchard?"

"Ethan Roscente is an HM Group executive. Seven-figure salary." Jenna clenched her fists. "We've been dating three months."

"Bullshit!" Victor hurled the certificate back. "A man like that would want you?"

Ice flashed in Jenna's eyes. "This orchard was my parents'. Hand it over, or we settle this in court."

Victor's face twisted. He grabbed an apple and threw it. "Ungrateful brat! After all I've done for you and Milo!"

The apple whizzed past Jenna's ear, exploding against the tree trunk.

"Court it is." She snatched the certificate and turned.

Victor's roar followed her. "Your dead parents must be rolling in their graves!"

The curses echoed through the orchard. Workers kept their heads down, silent.

Jenna revved her e-bike and sped away. Wind stung her eyes, but tears came anyway.

Her phone buzzed. Wiping her face, she saw Milo's call. She declined, pulling over to steady her breath.

At her fruit stand, she rolled up the shutter and flipped the "Open" sign. A quick social media post:
[Urgent: Need reliable lawyer. Paying well.]

Two customers came and went. Jenna weighed fruit mechanically, Victor's snarling face haunting her.

"Jenna!" Milo's cheerful voice chirped through the phone. "Can we have cola chicken wings for lunch?"

Her lips curved despite herself. "Sure. I'll make them at noon."

Hanging up, she stared at their sibling photo on her screen—the only reason she kept going.

Closing time. Ninety dollars in the till. Jenna locked up and headed to the market. The mingled scents of cola and chicken wings brought back memories of New Year's dinners when their parents were alive.
###Chapter 3

Jenna Roland tied on her apron and began preparing dinner.

Just as she placed the final dish on the table, Fiona Roland barged in, the stench of cigarettes from the mahjong parlor clinging to her.

Jason Roland and Heidi Roland arrived right on schedule, dressed in suits but unable to hide their crass nature.

"What's that amazing smell?" Jason sniffed the air, his eyes lighting up. "Cola Chicken Wings?"

Heidi shot Jenna a sidelong glance. "Well, isn't this a surprise? Last time I asked you to make this, you said you were too busy."

Before Jenna could respond, her phone vibrated.

It was Daisy Langley calling.

"Daisy?"

"About your lawyer search on social media—I have a friend who's a partner at a law firm."

Jenna hurried into the bedroom and shut the door.

In the living room, Fiona hissed under her breath, "Those wings are definitely for those two freeloaders. Go eat them now!"

"Mom always looks out for us." Jason grinned, dragging Heidi toward the kitchen.

By the time Jenna ended the call, Victor Roland and Milo Roland had just arrived home.

"Sis, I smell Cola Chicken Wings!" Milo's pale face flushed with excitement.

Jenna ruffled his hair. "Go wash up. I'll bring the food out."

The kitchen door was mysteriously closed.

When Jenna pushed it open, her blood ran cold—

Jason and Heidi were devouring the last of the wings, leaving only grease stains on the plate.

"What are you doing? Those were for Milo!" Jenna's voice trembled.

Jason wiped his greasy mouth. "What's the big deal? You've lived here for years rent-free. Can't even spare a few wings?"

Heidi sneered. "Know your place. You and your brother are just charity cases."

Jenna grabbed the plate and smashed it on the floor.

Porcelain shards flew everywhere.

Next came the frying pan, the rice cooker—every dish became a casualty of her rage.

"Are you insane?" Jason yelped.

"Not even leaving a bite for a sick person? Are you even human?" Jenna's eyes burned red.

"I told them to eat it! Got a problem? Take it up with me!" Fiona's shrill voice exploded from behind.

Jenna turned to see Victor's dark expression and Milo's frightened eyes.

Years of pent-up resentment burst forth.

Before the shouting even died down, Victor and Jason lunged at her.

Jenna dashed into the kitchen. The glint of a chef's knife flashed.

"Come on!" She pointed the blade at them. "Try laying a hand on me today!"

Fiona screamed. "How dare you! Ungrateful wretch!"

Victor retreated, cursing. "Go ahead, stab me! I'll call the cops!"

The blade sliced through air as Victor scrambled away.

"Sis!" Milo threw his arms around her. "Don't do something you'll regret!"

The knife clattered to the floor.

Jenna panted heavily. "Pack your things. We're leaving."

Fiona mocked, "Without us, you two won't even afford a bridge to sleep under!"

"Get out!" Jason spat venomously. "You're nothing but bad luck!"

When Milo emerged with their meager belongings, Jenna was already at the door.

As the front door slammed shut, Victor collapsed on the couch, mopping his brow. "That bitch has lost her mind!"

Outside, Jenna gripped her brother's ice-cold hand and stepped into the gathering dusk.
###Chapter 4

Jenna Roland stood on the street holding Milo's luggage, the sunlight stinging her eyes.

For the first time, she truly understood what it meant to be cornered.

Cutting off her uncle's family felt like removing leeches—painful but freeing.

Yet the two thousand dollars left in her pocket couldn't even rent a room in Los Angeles.

Milo stood beside her, nails digging into his palms.

He was the burden dragging his sister down.

If not for his congenital heart disease, Jenna could've had a better life long ago.

"Jenna," his voice tightened, "I'll stay at the dorm. You should go back to Uncle's place."

Her head snapped up. "Are you insane? After what just happened?"

Milo gave a bitter smile. "But we have nowhere else to go."

He knew better than anyone how toxic their uncle's household was.

Yet they had no alternatives.

Jenna ruffled his hair. "Don't worry. I'll borrow money for rent, sell the fruit stand, and find another job."

"Once we save enough, we'll reclaim the orchard."

At the mention of the orchard, Milo's eyes darkened.

That car accident had been too convenient.

The signature on the will wasn't their father's.

But no one believed him.

"Jenna," he blurted, "I'll quit school. I'll work instead."

Her face paled. "Shut up!"

"You're finishing school. You're going to college!"

Her voice trembled. "We're all Mom and Dad have left. You can't give up."

Milo lowered his head as she pressed twenty dollars into his hand.

"Meet me after school." Jenna watched the bus disappear down the street.

Back at the fruit stand, she packed up efficiently and posted a "For Sale" sign.

Her phone rang.

"Daisy?"

"Have you decided about the lawsuit?" Daisy Langley's voice came through.

"Too expensive," Jenna sighed. "Maybe when I save enough."

"Seven grand is too much? You've run this stand for two years!"

Jenna gave a hollow laugh. "Rent. Medicine. Groceries. Everything costs money."

She recounted the incident at her uncle's house.

"Good riddance!" Daisy slammed what sounded like a table. "Animals like that deserve worse!"

After a pause, Jenna ventured, "Can you lend me four thousand? For rent."

Silence.

"Actually... I'm a bit strapped right now..." Daisy hedged.

The call ended. Jenna dialed every friend she had.

Only a thousand dollars materialized.

Three grand total—not even enough for Milo's medication.

Her phone buzzed again.

"Grandma Blanche?" Jenna forced a smile.
###Chapter 5

"Sweetheart, you've already signed the marriage certificate. Why are you still calling me Grandma Blanche? It's time to just call me Grandma." The kind voice of Grandma Blanche came through the phone.

Jenna's fingers tightened slightly around her phone.

After a moment of hesitation, she softly said, "Grandma."

"That's more like it!" Grandma Blanche laughed heartily. "I have something to discuss with you."

"Go ahead."

"You and Ethan just got married, but your relationship is still new. I was thinking you two should live together first to build your bond. What do you think?"

"Live together?" Jenna's eyes widened.

She hadn't expected to face the issue of cohabitation just hours after signing the marriage certificate.

"You don't want to?" Grandma Blanche's tone suddenly turned dejected.

Jenna bit her lower lip. "We only met yesterday. This is too fast..."

She had never even been in a relationship before. The idea of sharing a roof with a stranger was hard to accept.

"Back in my day, your grandfather and I married first and fell in love later," Grandma Blanche coaxed. "Ethan may seem cold, but he's a good man at heart."

Jenna ran a frustrated hand through her hair. "Times have changed..."

She hadn't married Ethan for love.

The orchard still wasn't hers, and now she was trapped in this arrangement.

"Ethan works long hours and often skips meals," Grandma Blanche shifted tactics. "With you there to take care of him, I'd feel much better."

"But—"

"You're twenty-four now, and Ethan is such a catch. Why not give it a try?" Grandma Blanche pressed.

Jenna lowered her gaze. "I don't have the energy to think about this right now."

She had just been kicked out of her uncle's house and had nowhere to stay.

"Did something happen again?" Grandma Blanche's voice sharpened with concern. "Tell me, and I'll make it right!"

The genuine care in her tone made Jenna's eyes well up instantly.

Through tears, she recounted the day's events.

"Those despicable people!" Grandma Blanche fumed. "Give me their address. I'll teach them a lesson!"

"No, Grandma." Jenna wiped her tears. "I don't want any trouble."

A brief silence followed.

"So you and your brother have nowhere to go now?"

"Yeah." Jenna took a deep breath. "I plan to sell the fruit shop and find a job to support Milo."

"Silly girl!" Grandma Blanche sighed. "Let Ethan handle the household expenses while you focus on work and Milo's education. That way, you can save a lot."

Before Jenna could respond, the call ended.

She stared blankly at the darkened screen.

Grandma Blanche was right. Rent, living expenses, Milo's medical bills, legal fees—each was a massive financial burden.

If living together could solve their money problems...

But was Ethan really trustworthy?

She agonized over it all afternoon.

When Milo came home from school that evening, she shared her concerns.

"Sis, at least he's willing to cover the household expenses," Milo reasoned. "And I'll be here to protect you. Though you really should've told me before getting married."

"So you're okay with me moving in with him?"

"With him around, Uncle Victor won't dare bully you." His words struck a chord.

No one had ever stood up for her when her uncle's family mistreated her.

"Alright, I'll tell Grandma." Jenna finally made up her mind.

Grandma Blanche was overjoyed when she received the call, even eating two extra bowls of rice at dinner.

She shot a triumphant look at Ethan on the couch. "Jenna agreed to move in. You'd better treat her well."

Without looking up, Ethan replied coldly, "This was your decision. It has nothing to do with me."
###Chapter 6

Grandma Blanche's call came without warning.

Ethan Roscente had just finished his meeting when his phone buzzed.

"Move in with Jenna Roland tonight." Her tone brooked no argument.

Ethan's brow furrowed. "Grandma, this is too sudden."

"Sudden?" She scoffed. "You're already married. What's the problem?"

He massaged his temples. "We've only known each other for a day."

A teacup slammed down on the other end of the line.

"Your grandfather says if you don't go tonight, he'll freeze all your accounts tomorrow."

Ethan's lips curled into a cold smile. "That old trick again?"

"It works." Her voice dripped with satisfaction. "The car will pick you up at seven."

After hanging up, Ethan stared blankly at his phone.

The conference room windows reflected his tense jawline.

Dinner at the Roscente mansion was bathed in golden light.

Grandpa Harrison sat at the head of the table, his gaze piercing.

"The terms are simple." He tapped the table. "Live together for one year, and the company is yours."

Ethan set down his fork. "You said that last time."

Grace Roscente spoke softly, "Ethan, Jenna is really a lovely girl."

Benjamin Roscente nodded in agreement. "Your grandmother has an impeccable eye."

A flicker of mockery passed through Ethan's eyes.

"I want Yvonne Sherwood's whereabouts." His sudden demand silenced the room.

Grandpa Harrison's face darkened. "Out of the question!"

"Then we have nothing to discuss." Ethan pushed back his chair.

"Stop right there!" The old man slammed his palm on the table.

He turned to the bookshelf and threw a file onto the table.

"See for yourself!"

Ethan opened the folder, his pupils contracting sharply.

The surveillance photos showed Yvonne copying data to a USB drive.

The timestamp matched that rainy night four years ago.

"She only approached you to steal corporate secrets." Grandpa Harrison's voice was icy.

Ethan's knuckles turned white.

He closed the file, his voice hoarse. "I want a divorce after one year."

"Deal." The old man's triumphant smile appeared.

Grandma Blanche quickly added, "But you must genuinely try during this year!"

Ethan grabbed his coat and left without another word.

His silhouette looked especially lonely in the night.

The chauffeur had been waiting.

"To Miss Roland's apartment." Ethan leaned back, eyes closed.

The passing streetlights cast shifting shadows across his unreadable expression.

The woman who once haunted his dreams was fading from memory.
###Chapter 7

Jenna had just seen off two customers when her phone rang abruptly.

Grandma Blanche's name flashed on the screen.

She pulled out a chair and answered the call.

"Grandma."

"Jenna dear, when would be a good time for you to move in?"

She pressed her lips together. The old woman was in quite a hurry.

"Tomorrow."

"Perfect." Grandma Blanche's voice softened. "Ethan may seem cold, but he's a good man at heart. If he dares mistreat you, I'll be the first to teach him a lesson."

Jenna smirked silently.

Empty promises.

If trouble arose, who would side with an outsider?

"Grandma, can my brother live with us?"

"Of course!" The response came without hesitation. "You two only have each other. I'd never separate you."

Warmth bloomed in Jenna's chest.

This genuine kindness was why she'd agreed to the marriage.

"But Mr. Roscente—"

"He wouldn't dare object." Grandma Blanche huffed. "Anything else you need to prepare?"

"Nothing."

After hanging up, Jenna turned to Milo organizing the shelves.

"We're moving tomorrow. Get ready."

The teenager didn't look up. "You're the one who needs preparing, sis."

She arched an eyebrow.

"Remember—work hard and keep quiet there." She tapped his shoulder. "Less talking, more doing."

Milo nodded. "Got it."

Dusk settled as they closed the shop.

They grabbed dinner at a nearby diner.

...

A budget motel became their temporary lodging.

After paying for their room, Jenna made sure Milo was settled.

Fresh from a shower, she lay in bed scrolling job listings.

The failing fruit shop couldn't cover Milo's medical bills and tuition.

She needed stable income—fast.

Her phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number:

"Add WeChat."

Brevity worthy of Ethan himself.

Chuckling, she sent a friend request. No immediate acceptance.

Probably working late.

Job hunting proved frustrating.

Bachelor's degrees and three years' experience were standard requirements.

Her community college diploma and fruit shop management meant slim pickings.

Waitressing wages wouldn't cover expenses.

She posted a job-seeking status. Within minutes, Stella called.

"Looking for work?"

"Yeah." Jenna summarized her situation.

"Come to our club." Stella's voice turned eager. "Great pay."

"Too risky."

"It's 2023—what's there to fear?" Stella laughed. "I made twenty grand last month."

"Twenty thousand?" Jenna bolted upright. "But when I asked to borrow—"

"Went to my boyfriend's dad's hospital bills." A sigh. "Our boss has powerful connections. No one causes trouble here."

Jenna chewed her lip.

High rewards came with higher risks.

She needed money. But valued her life more.
###Chapter 8

"Send me your paycheck screenshot." Jenna Roland demanded, skepticism lacing her voice.

"Wait."
Stella Laurent hung up abruptly. A screenshot popped up on her phone moments later.

The number $20,000 glared back at her.
Jenna stared at her screen, fingers trembling slightly.

That was three months' worth of fruit stand profits.
With that kind of money, her and Milo's lives could change overnight.

"What if someone harasses me?" Jenna gnawed at her fingernail.
"Our boss owns Los Angeles!" Stella's tone turned cocky. "No one would dare touch you."

Five years of friendship eased Jenna's nerves slightly.
Still, she waited until dawn to reply: "Introduce me."

Morning light filtered through the curtains as Milo packed his schoolbag.
Jenna shoved a twenty into his hand. "Get lunch yourself."

An unknown number flashed on her phone.
"Selling your fruit stand?" A no-nonsense female voice asked.

The woman arrived in stilettos, eyes darting like a hawk.
"Five grand. Take it or leave it." Her manicured nail tapped the counter glass.

Jenna eyed the nearly spoiled strawberries and nodded through gritted teeth.
Regret hit the moment the contract was signed—she'd agreed too hastily last night.

A Maybach glided soundlessly beside her.
Grandma Blanche rolled down the window. "Your new place is ready."

Beverly Hills' glass towers reflected blinding sunlight.
Jenna gripped her e-bike handles—the battery indicator blinked its final bar.

The gray-toned living room felt as cold as a morgue.
"Master bedroom's for you lovebirds." Grandma Blanche grinned ear to ear.

Heat rushed to Jenna's ears.
Her gaze snagged on the men's leather shoes by the entrance—size 38, radiating the same keep-out aura as Ethan Roscente.

The price tag still clung to the Italian leather sofa.
Jenna inhaled sharply—that could buy ten of her e-bikes.

"All Zwilling knives in the kitchen." Grandma Blanche opened a drawer. "Ethan said you cook."

Jenna stared at the gleaming cookware.
Every molecule of air here whispered: You don't belong.
###Chapter 9 

Grandma Blanche led Jenna Roland into the kitchen. Brand-new cookware was neatly arranged, with even the seasonings fully stocked.

"Jenna, just let me know if you need anything," Grandma Blanche said affectionately, patting her hand.

"Thank you, Grandma," Jenna replied obediently.

The elderly woman nodded in satisfaction. "Get familiar with the place. I'll head back now."

Jenna escorted her to the elevator and watched the doors close before returning to the apartment.

Standing in the bright living room, Jenna couldn't help but smile. Finally free from her uncle's shadow, she and Milo could start anew.

Her mind raced with plans—find a job, hire a lawyer to reclaim the orchard, save for Milo's treatment.

After organizing Milo's clothes, Jenna settled on the sofa and checked her phone. Ethan Roscente still hadn't accepted her friend request.

Frowning, she sent another request, deciding this would be her final attempt.

While charging her e-bike outside, Jenna asked a neighbor for directions to the grocery store. The upscale Beverly Hills community had everything—schools, supermarkets, subway access.

Returning with groceries, she noticed Ethan had finally accepted her request. His profile picture was pure black, his username just a single period.

"Mr. Roscente, this is Jenna. Will you be home for lunch?" she typed carefully.

Fifteen minutes later, her phone vibrated. "Yes."

Even punctuation seemed excessive for him.

"What time should I expect you?" she pressed.

"Twelve." Still brutally concise.

Jenna tied on an apron and prepared lunch. Six flavorful dishes were laid out just as Milo burst in excitedly.

"Sis, what's the occasion?" His eyes sparkled at the feast.

"Your brother-in-law is coming for lunch," she explained.

The doorbell rang precisely at noon.

Jenna's breath caught when she opened the door. Ethan stood there in a black suit, his sharp features expressionless, radiating an icy aura.

"Mr. Roscente, please come in." She stepped aside.

Milo hovered nervously by the bathroom. "Hello, Mr. Roscente. I'm Milo."

Ethan gave him a frosty glance. "Hello." His voice could freeze water.

In the kitchen, Milo whispered, "Sis, he seems terrifying. What if—"

"Don't overthink it," Jenna cut him off. "Grandma Blanche said he's just reserved."

When they carried out the dishes, Ethan was already seated at the table. He took a bite of the stir-fried pork with garlic stems without changing expression.

"How does it taste?" Jenna ventured timidly.

"Hmm." Another monosyllabic reply.

Jenna sighed inwardly. Her cooking clearly needed improvement.
###Chapter 10

Ethan set down his chopsticks and dabbed his lips with a napkin.

His cool gaze shifted to the nervous young man beside him.

"Milo?"

Milo nearly choked on his rice. He scrambled to put down his bowl.

"Yes, Mr. Roscente. I'm Milo."

He sat up straight, hands properly placed on his knees.

Ethan's eyes swept over the siblings. "Since you're staying here, come to me if you need anything. As your brother-in-law, it's my duty to look after you."

Jenna's grip tightened around her chopsticks.

She hadn't expected Ethan to say that.

Ethan stood, adjusting his cuffs. "The living allowance will be deposited on time. Make sure your brother gets nutritious meals—he's still growing."

"Understood." Jenna quickly rose to her feet.

Ethan walked away without looking back.

Jenna followed him to the door. "Will you be home for dinner, Mr. Roscente?"

"Business dinner."

His detached reply floated through the closing elevator doors.

Jenna exhaled deeply and returned to the table.

"Ethan seemed to like your cooking." Milo picked up a spare rib.

Jenna stared at the empty rice bowl, lost in thought.

He'd eaten two full servings.

That small realization settled something inside her.

At least in this marriage, she still had some worth.

After cleaning up, Milo bounded out of his room excitedly.

"Jenna! This room is huge!"

He gestured animatedly, eyes sparkling.

Jenna smiled and handed him a key. "Come back on your own this afternoon. I have a job interview tonight."

"What kind of job?"

"Convenience store night shift." The lie came easily.

Milo frowned. "Be careful."

After seeing her brother off, Jenna rode her bike to an underground mall.

She needed decent clothes.

At 5 PM, Jenna stood outside Studio 54.

The chandelier's glare made her squint.

"Here for the interview?" A handsome man in uniform approached.

Jenna nodded. "Stella Laurent referred me."

He smiled. "I'm Brian. Follow me."

Inside VIP Room 888, two rows of men and women stood at attention.

A man lounged on the sofa, his shirt collar slightly open. Long fingers tapped the armrest.

"Boss, she's here." Brian bowed respectfully.

Tristan's gaze swept over Jenna.

"Twenty-four? Married?"

Jenna met his eyes. "Yes."

"Does your husband know?" Tristan's lips curved.

Jenna pressed her lips together. "He doesn't."
###Chapter 11

Tristan Ashcroft leaned against the leather sofa, his slender fingers lightly tapping the armrest.

His gaze settled on Jenna Roland as the corner of his lips curved upward. "What did you do before this?"

"Worked as a salesgirl at a fruit shop," Jenna answered honestly.

"Oh?" Tristan raised an eyebrow. "So you're good with words?"

Jenna pressed her lips together in a small smile. "I manage."

He stood up, looking down at her. "Escort girls have to drink with clients. Can you handle that?"

"No problem," Jenna nodded.

"Good." A satisfied smirk tugged at his lips. "You start today."

Jenna hesitated for a moment. "What about the pay?"

"Base salary of two thousand, plus commission based on performance," Tristan said casually. "Four days off per month. Shifts run from six p.m. to two a.m."

Jenna did the math in her head. Stella made twenty thousand—clearly, the real money was in commissions.

"Understood." She took a deep breath. This was her first job, and she had to make it count.

Tristan gave her a tour of the club. The place was massive—a dance floor on the first level, private rooms on the second and third, and hotel suites on the fourth and fifth.

After the tour, he led her to the dressing room.

"Wear this for now," he tossed her a uniform. "Left behind by the last girl."

Just as Jenna finished changing, her phone buzzed.

A message from Stella: Where are you?

Dressing room.

Moments later, Stella pushed the door open, dressed in a JK uniform.

She burst out laughing at the sight of Jenna.

"What's so funny?" Jenna frowned.

"It suits you perfectly!" Stella playfully smacked her backside. "Innocent schoolgirl—men go crazy for this look!"

Jenna dodged her. "Stop touching me!"

"Just getting you used to it," Stella teased with a wicked grin. "Plenty more hands will want to grab you later."

Jenna paled.

"Relax, I'm kidding!" Stella laughed. "Come on, we've got a meeting."

At the front desk, all eight beverage promoters had gathered.

After introducing Jenna, Supervisor Patrick Klein reminded everyone to look out for her.

The meeting had barely ended when the first clients arrived.

Patrick assigned Stella to mentor Jenna.

On the way, Stella explained sales techniques in detail, and Jenna listened attentively.

Outside Room 201, Stella lightly knocked.

"Good evening, gentlemen!" She pushed the door open with a bright smile.

Four middle-aged men sat inside. Stella greeted them smoothly. "Mr. Chen, the usual or trying something new today?"

But Mr. Chen's eyes were glued to Jenna.

"New girl?"

"Yes," Stella introduced. "This is Jenna Roland. Jenna, meet Mr. Chen, Mr. Li, Mr. Wu, and Mr. Xu."

Jenna gave a slight bow, her voice sweet and clear. "Pleasure to meet you all. I hope to learn from you."

She knew exactly how to charm clients. Her sugary tone and innocent outfit instantly drew their attention.

Mr. Chen's smile widened. "How old are you, sweetheart?"

"Twenty-four." Jenna's eyes curved into crescents.

"Prime of youth," Mr. Chen remarked before turning to Stella. "Six bottles of '91 Lafite tonight. Split the commission between you two."

Stella's eyes lit up. "Right away, sir!"

In the hallway, Stella hugged Jenna and planted two excited kisses on her cheeks.

"Do you know how much Lafite costs?" she whispered. "Twelve thousand per bottle! Six bottles is seventy-two grand!"

Jenna's eyes widened. "That much?"

"Six thousand in commission—three grand each!" Stella beamed.

Jenna's heart raced. Money came too easily here.

"But you only made twenty last month?" she suddenly recalled.

Stella pouted. "Bad luck. No one ordered the expensive stuff."
###Chapter 12

Jenna Roland nodded in sudden understanding.

She leaned closer to Stella Laurent and whispered, "Which is the most expensive liquor here?"

Stella rattled off a list with practiced ease. "The 1991 Lafite Rothschild is the priciest, followed by Ace of Spades, Royal Salute, Martell XO..."

Jenna's eyes lit up.

So pushing high-end alcohol was the key to making money.

Stella led her to the back to retrieve the bottles.

Every bottle had to be registered under the promoter's name in the system for commission tracking.

While waiting, Stella swiftly prepared fruit platters and glasses.

Four servers carried the drinks and snacks into the VIP room in single file.

Stella expertly uncorked and aerated the wine.

Mr. Chen's gaze lingered on Jenna. "First day?"

She flashed a professional smile. "Yes. I hope you'll take care of me, Mr. Chen."

"With a beauty like you here, we'll definitely visit more often," he said, eyes crinkling with amusement.

Mr. Wu chimed in. "Mr. Roscente is lucky to have someone like you."

Mr. Li didn't hold back his praise. "You and Stella are the most stunning girls in this club."

Jenna silently thanked the stars that no coworkers overheard.

She knelt gracefully to pour drinks.

"This toast is for all of you. May your businesses thrive." Jenna downed her glass in one go.

The men followed suit enthusiastically.

Just when she thought they could leave, Stella pulled her back to keep entertaining.

Half an hour later, they finally escaped.

In the hallway, Jenna rubbed her flushed cheeks. "This feels more like being an escort."

Stella shrugged helplessly. "Now you know money doesn't come easy."

"But it is fast cash," Jenna admitted.

"Remember—happy customers mean big tips." Stella pinched her cheek. "Don't forget me when you strike it rich."

Manager Patrick appeared abruptly. "Stella, Room 304 needs help."

After Stella left, he turned to Jenna. "You take Room 888. New faces are always refreshing."

Jenna took a deep breath and walked alone toward the private suite.

The moment she opened the door, her blood ran cold.

The man in the black shirt lounging on the sofa was none other than Ethan Roscente—her husband of two days.

Jenna froze in the doorway, paralyzed.

"Come in," Gavin Valentine urged.

Steeling herself, she entered while stealing a glance at Ethan.

His expression was thunderous, eyes dark with brewing fury.

Jenna's heart pounded wildly.

Tristan Ashcroft studied her. "New here?"

"First day," she replied tightly.

Gavin asked with interest, "What do you recommend?"

Jenna forced herself to focus. "The 1991 Lafite is twelve thousand, Ace of Spades eight thousand eight hundred..."

After flawlessly listing prices, she added, "For distinguished gentlemen like yourselves, only Lafite and Ace of Spades are worthy. Buy eight bottles and get the ninth half-price. You can store unfinished bottles here."

The flattery drew pleased smiles from the group.

Gavin turned to Ethan. "What'll you have?"

"Whatever," Ethan said coldly, returning to his phone without another glance.
###Chapter 13

Gavin Valentine tapped the polished table with his slender fingers, turning to Jenna Roland. "Four bottles of '91 Lafite, and four bottles of Ace of Spades. Pair them with whatever appetizers you recommend."

"Right away." Jenna suppressed her excitement, dipping her head slightly before stepping out.

The moment the door closed behind her, a grin broke across her face.

Four bottles of Lafite at $12,000. Four bottles of Ace of Spades at $8,750. With the snacks and fruit platter, this single order totaled nearly $22,500.

On her first day, she was already one step closer to her sister's surgery fund.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Ethan Roscente:
Need money?

Two simple words sent a chill down her spine. She could almost see his icy glare through the screen.

"Yes. Desperately." She typed quickly and shoved the phone back into her pocket.

The order was too large to carry alone. Manager Patrick Klein noticed and immediately summoned four servers to assist.

"Is that the new girl, Jenna?" Tristan Ashcroft stood at the end of the hallway, eyes narrowed.

Patrick nodded. "VIP Room 888 ordered four Ace of Spades and four Royal Salutes."

Tristan smirked. "$22,500 on her first day. Interesting." His gaze flicked toward the private room. "We should stock some million-dollar bottles."

"Boss, that's—"

"For Mr. Roscente." Tristan cut him off.

When Jenna returned to the room, she was pouring drinks for the guests. Tristan strode in with a polished smile, his eyes darting between Ethan and Jenna.

"Mr. Roscente, it's been too long." He extended a warm greeting.

Ethan didn’t even glance up, his focus locked on Jenna.

Tristan smoothly turned to her. "Make sure Mr. Roscente enjoys his drinks."

"Of course." Jenna lifted a glass and approached Ethan. "A toast, sir."

Ethan took it and drained it in one go, his stare freezing her in place.

Tristan's back grew damp with sweat. "Is... everything to your satisfaction?"

"Why is she here?" Ethan's voice was lethal.

The room fell silent.

Tristan wiped his brow and recounted Jenna’s hiring process in detail.

Ethan listened, fingertips tracing the rim of his glass. "She doesn’t know who I am." He lifted his gaze, sharp as a blade. "If she faces even a hint of disrespect—"

"Understood!" Tristan rushed to assure him. "I’ll treat her like my own sister!"

Only then did Ethan raise his glass in acknowledgment.

Tristan exhaled in relief, mind racing. Who is this girl? The Prince of Los Angeles is personally shielding her.
###Chapter 14

The night was deep. Jenna Roland rubbed her sore lower back and glanced at her phone—1:15 AM.

She quickly calculated tonight's commission. The number made her heart race: $8,300.

For a first night on the job, this was unbelievable. A small smile tugged at her lips.

"Hi, I'm Chloe Blanchet." A woman in a black uniform sat beside her and extended a hand.

Jenna shook it. "Jenna Roland."

Chloe's eyes held admiration. "Breaking records on your first night. Impressive."

"Just lucky with good clients," Jenna said modestly.

"Don't sell yourself short," Chloe shook her head. "You earned this."

Stella Laurent bounded over and threw an arm around Jenna's neck. "They say you made over eight grand tonight?"

Jenna nodded.

"Oh my god!" Stella's eyes sparkled. "Sophia Merouin's best night was only five grand, and she's been here forever!"

Chloe agreed. "That record stood for over a year. You shattered it on day one."

Stella pinched Jenna's cheek playfully. "The universe is handing you gold! Keep this up and you'll buy a house in no time."

Jenna laughed. "You'll get there too."

Patrick Klein approached. "Everyone except Stella's table can clock out now."

"Got it," Chloe said, standing to leave.

Jenna rose as well. "Patrick, I'm heading out."

"Coming back tomorrow?" he asked.

"Absolutely." No way would she walk away from this income.

"Add me on Signal," Patrick pulled out his phone. "And send me your size. I'll have your uniform ready."

After scanning his code, Jenna waved at Stella and headed to the locker room.

Outside Studio 54, Jenna waited by the curb for a cab. Suddenly, a black Maybach pulled up in front of her.

The window lowered, revealing Ethan Roscente's sharply defined profile.

"Get in," his tone brooked no argument.

Jenna obediently slid into the backseat.

"Finished work, Miss Roland?" Gavin Valentine turned from the driver's seat.

She recognized him from the VIP room earlier. "Just clocked out."

Gavin studied her curiously. "Why choose this line of work?"

"Need money," Jenna answered bluntly.

He glanced at Ethan's stony silence before pressing, "There are other ways—"

"Limited education," Jenna cut in. "Regular jobs don't pay enough."

Ethan lit a cigarette. "Where to?"

"Home," Jenna kept her gaze down.

"Take her to Beverly Hills," Ethan instructed Gavin, then exited the car without another word.

As they drove, Gavin probed, "You and Ethan seem... familiar?"

"Friends," Jenna replied too quickly.

Gavin clearly doubted this but didn't push further.

The car soon reached its destination.

"Thanks, Gavin." As Jenna stepped out, Gavin immediately dialed Ethan.

"About the Hudson Yards project—"

"You talked?" Ethan's voice turned icy.

"Of course not!" Gavin backpedaled. "But what's really going on with—"

"None of your business," Ethan interrupted. "Pick me up."

Gavin sighed and turned the car around.
###Chapter 15

Jenna pushed open the door to find Milo curled up asleep on the couch. He hadn't even taken off his jacket—clearly waiting for her to come home.

She tiptoed into the bathroom.

Lying in bed, Jenna stared blankly at the bedroom door. She'd expected Ethan to return, but the clock ticked on with no sound of the door opening.

Her lips twisted into a self-deprecating smile as she gazed at the ceiling.

Spending her wedding night alone—what a mockery of marriage.

Then again, perhaps it was for the best. At least she wouldn't have to worry about Ethan touching her.

She turned off the bedside lamp and quickly fell asleep.

"Jenna, wake up."

Milo's voice pulled her from sleep.

"I made noodles. Eat them while they're hot."

Only then did Jenna remember she'd barely eaten last night, too busy drinking. Waking up thirsty multiple times had left her stomach completely empty.

After washing up, she sat at the dining table.

A steaming bowl of plain noodle soup waited for her.

"What time did you get back last night?" Milo asked between slurps.

"Past two," Jenna said, picking up a bite of noodles. "You were sleeping soundly, so I didn't wake you."

Milo struggled with insomnia—once awakened, he could never fall back asleep.

"The couch is fine."

"Don't wait up for me tonight. Just go to your room."

"Okay."

After finishing the noodles, Jenna returned to bed and slept until noon.

She dialed Ethan's number.

"Mr. Roscente, will you be home for lunch? Understood. I'll start preparing now."

Hanging up, she tied on an apron. Thankfully, she'd stocked up on groceries yesterday—there was no time to shop now.

Just as she plated the last dish, the doorbell rang.

Ethan and Milo stood together at the entrance.

"How did you two arrive together?" Jenna eyed them curiously.

"Ran into each other at the gate," Milo explained.

Jenna nodded. "Wash up first. Lunch is ready."

Ethan only gave a terse "Hmm."

The dining table was eerily silent. Jenna kept her head down, terrified Ethan might bring up her job at the club.

But he never mentioned it throughout the meal.

She exhaled in relief.

When she returned from washing dishes, only Ethan remained in the living room.

Her fingers twisted nervously.

"Mr. Roscente, should I prepare dinner?"

His gaze scraped over her like a blade.

Jenna shivered under his scrutiny.

"Was...was the food not to your liking?"

Those dark eyes held glacial contempt. Ethan remained convinced Jenna had manipulated Grandma Blanche into forcing this marriage upon him.
###Chapter 16

Ethan Roscente stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, cigarette ash crumbling from his fingertips.

His gaze darkened as he stared at the untouched supplementary card in his mobile banking app.

This woman would rather expose herself in that wretched place than spend a single cent of his money.

"Pathetic act," he sneered, grinding the cigarette butt into the crystal ashtray.

Jenna Roland entered the study with a fruit platter, only to meet Ethan's glacial stare. Her hands trembled, nearly dropping the tray.

"Mr. Roscente..."

Ethan suddenly rose, his towering frame looming over her. His long fingers gripped her chin with bruising force.

"Jenna," his voice was dangerously low. "Don't think I don't see through your little game."

Her pupils contracted in confusion.

"Grandmother might fall for your act, but I won't." He released her, wiping his fingers with distaste. "Stay out of my sight tonight."

The door slammed shut. Jenna stood frozen, her fingertips turning icy.

She took a deep breath, forcing composure. Since she couldn't decipher his motives, survival came first.

At the supermarket, Jenna carefully selected ingredients—chicken wings, beef, ribs—all to nourish Milo.

"Here, miss." A little boy offered her candy at checkout.

She smiled, ruffling his hair while bitterness welled up inside. Even strangers showed kindness, yet Ethan regarded her with nothing but hostility.

Night fell. Studio 54 blazed with neon lights.

"Booth 304 ordered red wine." The manager handed Jenna the tray. "Careful—those clients are trouble."

Adjusting her uniform skirt, she pushed open the door.

Hazy smoke filled the private room where four middle-aged men pawed at their escorts. Mr. Li's eyes lit up at her entrance.

"New girl?" His gaze raked over her. "Come drink with us."

Jenna retreated half a step, maintaining professionalism. "Sir, I'm a beverage promoter."

Mr. Chen scoffed. "Playing hard to get?" He slapped a thick wad of cash on the table. "Enough to buy your whole night?"

The escorts giggled suggestively. Jenna's knuckles whitened around the tray.

Then the door burst open.

Ethan stood at the threshold, his gaze sharp as a blade.
###Chapter 17

Jenna Roland walked into the private room in her stilettos, a practiced sweet smile on her face. "Good evening, gentlemen. What would you like to drink tonight?"

Mr. Li crossed his legs lazily. "Start us off with a dozen Budweisers."

Jenna blinked, her lips curving into the perfect polite arc. "You gentlemen clearly have refined tastes. Budweiser seems too ordinary for men of your stature."

Her honeyed words made the middle-aged men beam with pleasure.

Mr. Chen stroked his chin. "The Budweiser last time was rather bland. What do you recommend, sweetheart?"

"Of course, sir." Jenna smoothly listed a selection of premium liquors, her voice crisp and melodious.

Mr. Chen waved a hand. "Three bottles of Rémy Martin XO, then."

Jenna gave a slight bow. "Right away, gentlemen."

As she turned, her smile deepened. Three bottles of XO meant a guaranteed commission tonight.

Back at the bar, she efficiently placed the order and retrieved the bottles. When she returned to the private room, her smile had grown even warmer.

"A toast to your prosperity and boundless success." She raised her glass, eyes glinting playfully.

The men were utterly charmed, downing their drinks eagerly.

"What's your name, girl?" Mr. Chen asked, squinting at her.

"Jenna Roland." She kept her gaze lowered as she poured, her lashes casting delicate shadows under the lights.

"Why work at a place like this?" Mr. Ray interjected.

Jenna sighed softly. "Not all of us have your talents, gentlemen. I make do with what I have."

"Such a silver tongue," Mr. Ray laughed heartily. "Ever thought about changing jobs?"

She shook her head, red lips curving. "Let me focus on keeping your glasses full for now."

After several rounds, she excused herself gracefully. The moment she stepped out, a familiar voice called from behind.

"Jenna?"

Her entire body stiffened. She quickened her pace without looking back.

"Why are you running?" The voice pursued her relentlessly. "It's Sean!"

Her heartbeat spiked. The sharp click of her heels against the marble floor grew frantic.
###Chapter 18

Jenna's fingers dug into the serving tray, her nails nearly piercing her palms.

She never expected to run into Sean Roland here.

First Ethan Roscente yesterday, now her cousin today. Trouble truly never came alone.

"Jenna!" Supervisor Patrick's voice echoed from down the hallway. "Room 404 needs service. Get over there."

She was about to seize the escape when an iron grip clamped around her wrist.

Her entire body froze. Even her breath hitched.

She kept her head stubbornly lowered, refusing to meet his gaze.

"Turn around." Sean's voice could have flash-frozen hell.

Patrick eyed them suspiciously. "You two know each other?"

"She's my sister." Sean's tone brooked no argument.

Patrick's brows knitted together. "Jenna, this is your brother?"

Her spine straightened like a steel rod.

Five years apart, yet Sean would recognize that stubborn posture anywhere.

She inhaled deeply, forcing her shoulders to relax.

"Patrick, could someone else take Room 404?" Her voice trembled. "I need to talk with my brother."

Patrick waved them toward Room 301.

"Thanks." Jenna murmured, holding the door open for Sean.

The moment it clicked shut, an eerie calm settled over her.

"Sean."

The name escaped softer than a whisper.

Of all the Rolands, he'd never once kicked her when she was down.

Every time Aunt Fiona bullied her, he'd been the one to intervene.

Which made him the last person she wanted witnessing her current state.

"You work here?" Sean's piercing gaze raked over her uniform.

A beverage promoter at Studio 54. He knew exactly what that entailed.

The proud Roland heiress reduced to this.

Jenna's lips twisted. "What else would I be doing?"

"Mom and Dad said you chose to move out?"

"Something like that." Her tone turned glacial.

Sean's frown deepened. "This place isn't safe. Come home."

Home?

The image of those cola chicken wings flashed before her eyes.

Made specially for Milo, devoured by Jason and Heidi before he could take a bite.

They'd not only stolen his food but called him a sickly burden.

That house stopped being theirs long ago.

"Sean," she said quietly, each word deliberate as a guillotine blade. "Milo and I would rather sleep on the streets."
###Chapter 19

Jenna's lips twisted into a bitter smile as she met Sean's gaze. "Tell me honestly, Sean. Did that place ever feel like home to Milo and me?"

Her words struck like a blade, piercing straight through his heart.

His Adam's apple bobbed, but no sound came out.

"This isn't the right environment for you," Sean said through clenched teeth. "Listen to me. Quit this job."

"I like it just fine." Jenna's voice remained steady. "At least I don't have to beg Uncle Victor for Milo's medical bills anymore. No more enduring their condescending looks. No more serving them like a maid."

Five years of living under their roof. Five years of swallowing every insult.

She would've left long ago if not for Milo.

Now that she'd finally escaped, she'd never go back.

"I'll give you a thousand dollars every month," Sean blurted, desperation creeping into his voice. "Just walk away from this place."

He couldn't bear to see his little sister sinking into this life.

"This isn't your concern." Jenna's tone left no room for argument. "But thank you."

"Jenna—"

"If you truly care about me," she interrupted, "don't tell Uncle Victor where I work."

She knew exactly how that family would react.

Sean exhaled sharply, defeat weighing down his shoulders.

"Call me if you need anything."

"I will. Now excuse me—I have work to do."

As Jenna walked away, Sean clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white.

Useless. He was a useless brother.

"Damn it!"

His fist collided with the wall before he stormed off, fury radiating from every step.

......

The shrill ringtone jolted Jenna awake the next morning.

Grandma Blanche's name flashed across the screen.

She answered immediately. "Grandma?"

"Come have lunch with me today, dear."

"Mr. Roscente and Milo should be back by noon. I already bought groceries..." Jenna hedged politely.

"Perfect! I'll be right over." Grandma Blanche cheerfully cut her off.

Jenna took a deep breath as she ended the call.

After a quick shower, she dressed and applied light makeup.

The reflection staring back looked refreshed.

Hesitating, she dialed Ethan's number.

Ring... Ring...

The call went straight to voicemail.

Jenna stared at her phone, chest tightening.

Was he still upset over yesterday's misunderstanding?

If she'd really been after his money, she would've signed that prenup ages ago.

She sighed. When you live under someone else's roof, you learn to swallow your pride.
###Chapter 20

Jenna Roland glared at her phone screen as she dialed Ethan Roscente's number for the third time.

The line rang twice before being abruptly disconnected again.

She threw her phone onto the couch in frustration.

Fine. The man was determined to give her the cold shoulder.

The sound of running water came from the kitchen.

Jenna tied on her apron and began preparing dinner.

......

At the fifteenth-floor conference room of HM Group headquarters, Ethan sat at the head of the table, his fingers tapping impatiently on the polished surface.

The sudden ringing of a phone silenced the entire room.

Executives exchanged uneasy glances. Who would dare disturb a meeting presided over by the CEO?

Even more shocking—the phone rang a second time.

Ethan's expression darkened dangerously.

He powered off the device and slammed it onto the table.

"Continue."

That single icy word made the presenting executive flinch.

Everyone present pitied the fool who'd interrupted the meeting.

......

Just as Jenna picked up a kitchen knife, the doorbell chimed.

She wiped her hands and hurried to the entrance.

"Grandma Blanche?"

The elderly woman stood outside laden with shopping bags.

"Help me with these, dear."

Jenna quickly took the heavy bag of fruits.

"You shouldn't have brought so much."

Grandma Blanche smiled warmly as she entered. "All fresh and good for your health."

Jenna poured her a glass of water.

"This is too generous."

"Nonsense, my pension covers it." The older woman pulled Jenna down beside her. "Has Ethan been home these past days?"

Jenna's ears turned pink as she shook her head slightly.

Grandma Blanche's expression darkened instantly.

"That ungrateful brat!"

She reached for her phone, but Jenna stopped her.

"Grandma, we barely know each other. These things take time."

The older woman slapped her knee in frustration.

"He doesn't know how lucky he is!"

Jenna lowered her gaze.

Truthfully, she preferred Ethan's absence.

But Grandma Blanche had other plans.

The matriarch had already calculated—how could they build affection without living together?

And how would she ever hold a great-grandchild?
###Chapter 21

Grandma Blanche held Jenna Roland's hand, her gaze tender enough to melt hearts.

"You're always so thoughtful, unlike that rascal Ethan who does nothing but vex me." She patted Jenna's hand lightly. "If he weren't a Roscente, I'd have kicked him out long ago."

Jenna smiled, her eyes crinkling. "Don't upset yourself, Grandma. It's not worth ruining your health."

"Alright, alright, I'll listen to you." Grandma Blanche's eyes narrowed into happy crescents. "What's for lunch today?"

"I've prepared four dishes and a soup." Jenna adjusted her apron as she stood. "Since it's your first time tasting my cooking, I'd love your feedback."

Grandma Blanche suddenly remembered something. "Is Ethan coming home for lunch?"

Jenna shook her head, a flicker of disappointment in her eyes.

She'd called Ethan twice already. No answer.

"You go ahead. I'll check with him." Grandma Blanche waved her off.

Jenna turned toward the kitchen.

The warmth vanished from Grandma Blanche's face the moment Jenna left. She pulled out her phone and dialed Ethan's number.

The first call went straight to voicemail.

"How dare he!" Her eyes flashed with anger.

The second call finally connected.

"Ethan! You hung up on me?" Her voice sharpened.

"Board meeting. Talk later." His tone was ice.

"You—"

The line went dead before she could finish.

Grandma Blanche stomped her foot in frustration.

Thirty minutes later, Ethan called back.

Grandma Blanche leaned against the sofa, her voice arctic. "Why aren't you staying at Beverly Hills? What happened to your promise?"

"She tattled?" Displeasure dripped from his words.

"I'm here right now!" A cold laugh. "Do you think I'm blind?"

Silence stretched on the other end.

"Busy these two days. I'll come tomorrow night." His voice remained flat.

He almost mentioned Jenna working at the club, their rare encounters. But he swallowed the words.

"Do I look like a child to you?" Her voice spiked.

"You've always been easy to placate." Calm. Unmoved.

"Ethan!" She slammed the table and stood. "If I don't see you tomorrow night, I'm moving into HM Group headquarters!"

——

Top-floor office at HM Group.

Ethan reclined in his leather chair, long fingers massaging his temples.

"Understood." Resignation tinged his reply.

In this family, Grandma Blanche ruled supreme. If he disobeyed, Grandpa Harrison would undoubtedly threaten with company shares again.

Irritated, he loosened his tie. His gaze fell on the photo frame on his desk—Grandma Blanche smiling benevolently at the camera.
###Chapter 22

"You must come home for lunch, or I'll tell your grandfather."

Grandma Blanche's voice brooked no argument through the phone.

Ethan Roscente didn't get a chance to respond before the call disconnected.

He set down his phone and pulled a cigarette from the drawer.

The crisp click of his lighter echoed sharply in the silent office.

Pale blue smoke curled from his lips.

Ethan narrowed his eyes.

Just what kind of spell had Jenna Roland cast on the old woman?

His grandmother might be softhearted in her old age, but he wasn't so easily fooled.

As long as he was around, Jenna wouldn't get her way.

Stubbing out the cigarette, Ethan checked his wristwatch before grabbing his suit jacket and striding out.

......

Aromatic scents wafted from the kitchen.

Jenna was setting the last dish on the table when the doorbell rang.

Wiping her hands, she hurried to the entrance.

Her breath caught when she opened the door.

Ethan stood there in his black suit, his handsome face expressionless.

Those deep-set eyes were glacial.

Jenna swallowed hard. "Mr. Roscente, you're back."

She stepped aside, closing the door quietly after he entered.

The man's expression looked even darker than last time.

Had Grandma Blanche said something?

Or had he misunderstood again?

Her stomach twisted with unease.

"Jenna's finished cooking. Go wash up first." Grandma Blanche's voice carried from the dining room.

Without a word, Ethan headed for the bathroom.

Grandma Blanche approached Jenna with a gentle tone. "Is Milo eating with us?"

"He said he's having lunch at a friend's." Jenna shook her head.

"Then let's start without him." The older woman nodded.

Jenna turned to serve the rice.

Ethan emerged from washing his hands, his gaze sweeping over the table.

The homely dishes appeared simple, yet inexplicably whetted his appetite.

Jenna returned with two bowls of rice, placing them before Grandma Blanche and Ethan.

She went back for her own portion and took the seat beside Grandma Blanche.

"Jenna's quite the cook." Grandma Blanche accepted her chopsticks with a smile. "Just looking at this makes my mouth water."

Jenna gave a modest smile. "I can handle home cooking, but I'd embarrass myself with Western cuisine. Please try it, Grandma."

Grandma Blanche picked up a slice of garlic stir-fried pork.

The moment the meat touched her tongue, her eyes brightened.

"How is this so tender?"

She remembered the tough, stringy pork from their last restaurant meal.

"It's marinated beforehand, and the heat is controlled just right." Jenna explained.

"With my bad teeth, I prefer it soft like this." Grandma Blanche nodded approvingly, shooting a glance at the silent Ethan. "I'll be coming over for meals often from now on."

"You're always welcome, Grandma." Jenna replied warmly.
###Chapter 23

Ethan remained silent throughout the dinner, focused solely on the food before him.

Jenna's cooking unexpectedly suited his refined palate.

This picky young master had gone through over fifty chefs during his four years at Beverly Hills.

In the end, they'd only managed to satisfy his taste buds by hiring a Michelin three-star chef at exorbitant costs.

Yet Jenna's home-cooked meal had conquered his notoriously difficult appetite.

Grandma Blanche watched her grandson eating with rare enthusiasm, her face breaking into a pleased smile.

"What are you smiling at?" Ethan asked without looking up.

"Does Jenna's cooking meet your standards?" Grandma Blanche inquired cheerfully.

"It's passable." Ethan responded casually.

To Grandma Blanche, this lukewarm response was high praise indeed.

She enthusiastically served Jenna more food. "You've worked hard, dear. Eat more."

"Thank you, Grandma." Jenna replied sweetly.

Noticing Ethan's single-minded focus on his own plate, Grandma Blanche kicked him under the table.

"Serve your wife some food!"

Jenna quickly waved her hands. "Please don't trouble Mr. Roscente."

Ethan glanced up at his grandmother. "She has hands."

Grandma Blanche glared in frustration.

Her grandson wasn't just prideful—he was hopelessly obtuse when it came to women.

Without her intervention, he'd likely remain a bachelor forever.

"Enough nonsense! Serve your wife!" Grandma Blanche commanded.

Jenna declined again. "Really, it's unnecessary."

Grandma Blanche turned to Jenna. "From now on, don't hesitate to order him around. Don't spoil him!"

"Alright." Jenna agreed with a nod.

Ethan never did serve Jenna any food.

After finishing his meal, he wiped his mouth. "Business at the company. I'm leaving."

"You must come home tomorrow night!" Grandma Blanche called after him.

Ethan departed without looking back.

Once the door closed, Grandma Blanche gave Jenna an apologetic look. "Forgive his manners."

Jenna smiled. "Everyone has different personalities. Marriage requires mutual understanding."

Grandma Blanche nodded approvingly. "It warms my heart to hear you say that."

"Grandma, shall we continue our meal?" Jenna served the elderly woman more dishes.

After dinner, when Grandma Blanche moved to clear the table, Jenna stopped her.

"Please rest. I'll clean up."

"But you already cooked."

"Family shouldn't stand on ceremony." Jenna insisted.

Having tidied the kitchen, Jenna returned to the living room. "Will you join me for lunch tomorrow, Grandma?"

She planned to go grocery shopping in advance.
###Chapter 24

"I'm going hiking with Aunt Lin tomorrow, so I won't be joining you for dinner." Grandma Blanche smiled warmly. "But Ethan promised to move in tomorrow evening. If he doesn't show up, you must tell me. I'll break his legs!"

Jenna Roland's lips curved slightly. "Don't worry, Grandma. I'll make sure he does."

"Good girl." Grandma Blanche patted her hand. "I'll head back now."

Jenna stood to see her out, only returning inside after the elevator doors closed.

......

At half past five in the evening, Jenna rode a shared bike to Studio 54.

She had just changed into her uniform when Tristan Ashcroft's assistant came to summon her. The boss wanted to see her.

Pushing open the door to VIP Room 888, Jenna's heartbeat quickened. She clenched the hem of her shirt, her voice tense. "Boss, did I do something wrong?"

Tristan didn't answer. He merely pointed to the leather sofa across from him, a knowing smile playing on his lips.

"Sit."

Jenna perched cautiously on the edge, her fingers twisting together unconsciously. "If there's anything I need to improve, please tell me. I'll correct it immediately."

"Who said you did anything wrong?" Tristan suddenly laughed.

Jenna blinked. "Then why did you call me here...?"

Tristan lit a cigar, exhaling a slow smoke ring. "You and Mr. Roscente... you're close?"

The question made Jenna frown slightly. "Why do you ask?"

Tristan lounged against the sofa, crossing his long legs. The tip of his cigar glowed faintly red.

"Answer me first. How well do you know each other?"

"We... met through his grandmother. We're not that close." Understanding dawned on Jenna.

"I see." Disappointment laced Tristan's tone.

Jenna ventured carefully, "Is there something you need, Boss?"

He'd hoped to use Jenna to get closer to Ethan Roscente and secure the Hudson Yards project. Clearly, that plan wouldn't work.

"Never mind. You can go."

Jenna exhaled inwardly. Though curious, she knew better than to pry.

"Understood, Boss."

Just as she reached the door, Tristan called out again.

"Jenna."

She turned to find him wearing an uncharacteristically serious expression.

"If you ever have trouble at the club, come straight to me." He tapped his cigar. "Anyone who messes with you answers to me."

After all, Ethan Roscente had personally warned him to take care of her. He wouldn't dare neglect that.

"Thank you, Boss."

Jenna closed the door softly behind her, releasing a long breath. The hallway lights stretched her shadow long and thin—just like her tangled emotions.
###Chapter 25

Jenna Roland stepped out of the private room, a cloud of suspicion forming in her mind.

What exactly had Ethan Roscente said to Tristan Ashcroft that night?

How could a mere HM Group supervisor make a club owner obey his every word?

She shook her head, deciding not to dwell on it.

Making money was what really mattered.

In the main hall, Stella Laurent hurried over and slung an arm around her shoulders.

"Made a killing last night, didn't you?"

"Less than the first night, but enough."

Stella winked. "Told you this gig pays well. Just report any handsy clients to the boss."

Jenna nodded.

The click of high heels approached.

Sophia Merouin stopped before them, towering in her stilettos as she looked Jenna up and down.

"New girl's got skills. Broke records on your first day."

"Got lucky."

Sophia smirked. "Better tone it down before you attract the wrong attention."

With that, she strutted away.

Jenna frowned at Stella.

"What's her problem?"

"Jealousy." Stella lowered her voice. "She's sleeping with the boss. Steer clear."

Understanding dawned on Jenna.

No wonder Sophia acted so entitled.

"You smashed her sales record. Of course she hates you." Stella rolled her eyes. "Took her two years to hit five grand. You made eight in one night."

Jenna shrugged indifferently.

She was here for the money, not to make friends.

Let the jealous ones seethe.
###Chapter 26

The conference room lights were harsh.

Jenna Roland rubbed her eyes as Patrick Klein pushed the door open.

"Stella, Jenna, come with me." Patrick's tone brooked no argument.

Sophia Merouin stood in the corner, arms crossed, chin lifted. Her posture screamed: I own this place.

Jenna's gaze flickered over her.

"What are you staring at?" Sophia's eyes turned glacial.

Jenna looked away calmly. "I was looking at Chloe."

Chloe Blanchet pointed at herself, confused. "Me?"

"We'll talk later." Jenna's voice was flat.

Patrick cleared his throat. "The boss just acquired two new wines. A 1974 Romanée-Conti priced at $26,000. And a Moët & Chandon for $5,300."

Stella Laurent's hand shot up. "What's the commission?"

"Standard rate. Ten percent." Patrick scanned the room. "Sell one Romanée-Conti, earn $2,600."

Chloe gasped. "$2,600 in one night?"

"Exactly." Patrick nodded. "If you've got what it takes."

Stella elbowed Jenna. "You can do this. Dinner's on you!"

Jenna scoffed. "Who can afford wine that expensive?"

She thought of her empty wallet last night. Not every evening brought clients like Ethan Roscente.

"How do you know unless you try?" Stella's eyes glittered. "$2,600!"

Patrick clapped. "Meeting adjourned."

Chloe bounced over. "What did you want?"

"What perfume are you wearing?" Jenna asked offhandedly.

"Chanel No. 5. Over $800." Chloe preened.

Jenna's pupils contracted. That was half a month's medication money.

"You earn enough now." Chloe winked.

Jenna shook her head. Her brother's surgery fees, legal costs—all bottomless pits. A $10 drugstore scent would do.

Exiting the conference room, Jenna clenched her fists. As long as the money was clean, let people think what they wanted.
###Chapter 27

Jenna Roland was chatting with Stella Laurent in the lounge when Patrick Klein suddenly pushed the door open.

"Chloe, VIP Room 3 has guests. Go attend to them."

After Chloe Blanchet left, Stella turned to Jenna with curiosity.

"How does our club assign hostesses?"

Stella set down her water glass. "Normally it's by shift order. But if a guest requests someone specifically, that hostess goes directly."

Jenna nodded thoughtfully.

Thirty minutes later, Patrick hurried over again.

"Jenna, Room 888 requested you. Get over there now."

Jenna froze.

She'd only worked here two days. She could count her previous guests on one hand.

Who would ask for her specifically?

Adjusting her uniform, Jenna walked toward Room 888 with growing puzzlement.

She knocked three times before entering.

Her steps faltered when she saw the occupants.

Gavin Valentine and Ethan Roscente sat on the sofa.

They'd just been here two days ago. Why were they back?

Even more surprising—Gavin had specifically requested her.

"Miss Roland, we meet again." Gavin smiled in greeting.

Jenna gave a slight bow. "Mr. Valentine, Mr. Roscente, good evening."

Four unfamiliar men accompanied them this time—none present during their last visit.

Ethan remained silent as usual.

Gavin swirled his glass. "Any recommendations tonight?"

Jenna pressed her lips together. "We have two new arrivals. A Romanée-Conti at $26,000 per bottle, and Moët & Chandon at $5,300. The rest are the same as last time."

Gavin arched an eyebrow. "Twenty-six thousand? Don't tell me you stocked that just for us."

Jenna hesitated.

What did he mean by that?

Gavin waved a hand. "Just joking. We'll take the usual."

Jenna exhaled in relief.

For a moment she'd thought they'd actually order that astronomical wine.

"Of course. Please wait a moment."

She exited, gently closing the door behind her.

The moment she left, Gavin scooted closer to Ethan. "Quit pretending. If you wanted to drink, you could've just said so."

Ethan lit a cigarette, his tone flat. "Business meeting."

"With who?" Gavin took the proffered pack.

"You'll see."

Smoke curled around Ethan's sharp profile as he exhaled. Only then did Gavin realize this was genuinely a work engagement.

He'd assumed it was about Jenna.

The door opened again.

A sharply dressed man entered, his smile directed solely at Ethan. "Mr. Roscente, apologies for the wait."

Ethan gave a slight nod. "Mr. Deross. Have a seat."
###Chapter 28

Gavin Valentine froze for a moment before rising to offer his seat.

Sebastian Deross settled into the chair with effortless grace, his long fingers tapping lightly against the tabletop.

"And you are?" Gavin couldn't help asking.

"Sebastian Deross." The man's lips curved slightly, his voice a deep, pleasant timbre. "Of the Deross family in Rivercrest."

Ethan Roscente nearly dropped his wineglass. "The third son of Rivercrest's Deross family?"

Gavin's eyes widened as he studied the strikingly handsome man before him with disbelief.

In business circles, the Deross family rivaled the Roscentes in reputation, though slightly less powerful.

"The one and only." Sebastian's smile held a hint of something unreadable.

"I heard you were studying abroad?" Gavin pressed.

"Finished my education." Sebastian replied casually.

The private room door swung open as Jenna Roland entered with a tray of drinks.

She immediately sensed the tense atmosphere but maintained professional silence.

Sebastian's gaze lingered on Jenna. "New here?"

"You're a regular, Mr. Deross?" Gavin asked, surprised.

"An old classmate owns this place." Sebastian shrugged. "But this young lady is new to me."

Jenna kept her head down as she opened bottles, feeling the weight of an intense stare.

"Jenna Roland." She answered briefly.

"Why choose this line of work?" Sebastian asked with genuine interest.

Jenna instinctively glanced at Ethan, noting his thunderous expression.

"Money." She stated plainly.

Sebastian chuckled. "Honest."

Gavin quickly intervened. "You may leave now."

Jenna set down the glasses, stealing one last glance at Ethan before exiting.

The man hadn't spoken a word, his entire demeanor radiating icy detachment.

"Care for a drink, Mr. Roscente?" Sebastian raised his glass.

Ethan clinked glasses silently and drained his in one go.

"Feel like singing, Mr. Deross?" Gavin attempted to lighten the mood.

"Not tonight." Sebastian declined. "I'd rather discuss potential collaboration with Mr. Roscente."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees.
###Chapter 29

Jenna had just stepped out of the private room when Stella yanked her into a corner of the hallway.

"Well? Did you sell that $26,000 bottle of wine?" Stella whispered, her eyes gleaming.

Last night, Jenna had served the VIPs in Room 888. That single table alone had earned her over $5,000 in commission.

Jenna shook her head. "They didn't want it. Just ordered their usual."

"Oh my god!" Stella gasped. "Still, those drinks alone must've made you half a month's salary!"

Jenna gave a small smile. "That wine's too expensive. Most people wouldn't order it."

"Tell me about it," Stella huffed. "I've been pitching it all night, but no takers."

Suddenly, Patrick appeared at the end of the hallway, striding toward them.

"Finished up, Jenna?"

"Yeah. They didn't ask me to toast with them. Just let me leave."

Patrick rubbed his hands together, barely containing his eagerness. "Did you sell any of the new labels?"

Those clients in Room 888 were clearly loaded. Especially the leader—his wristwatch looked straight out of a luxury magazine, worth seven figures.

Jenna lowered her lashes. "I'm sorry, Patrick. I couldn't close the sale."

Patrick's smile froze, then quickly morphed into a strained one.

"No worries. You're new. It takes time."

He patted her shoulder. "Head to Room 402. Tony's crew just arrived, and we're short-staffed."

"Got it." Jenna nodded at Stella. "I'll go ahead."

Stella opened her mouth, then closed it, her brow furrowed.

Once Jenna was out of earshot, Stella grabbed Patrick's arm.

"Patrick, you know what Tony's like! Jenna's only been here a few days!"

Tony had a notorious reputation. Every visit ended in some kind of trouble. No one at the club wanted to deal with him.

Patrick's expression hardened. "If she works here, she handles all types of clients. That's the rule."

"But she's got a temper. What if—"

Tony always brought a dozen lackeys. If Jenna resisted, things could turn ugly.

"Work is work." Patrick waved her off impatiently. "If there's trouble, the boss will handle it. Now get back to work."

Biting her lip, Stella discreetly sent Tristan a text.

...

Jenna stood outside Room 402, took a deep breath, and knocked.

The door swung open, releasing a thick cloud of cigarette smoke. In the dim light, a dozen young men lounged, puffing away.
###Chapter 30

The private room was hazy with smoke. Under the colorful strobe lights, a group of oddly dressed men lounged carelessly. One sported garish blonde hair, another had menacing tattoos snaking up his arms, while a third exhaled thick smoke through his teeth.

At the center of the leather couch sat a bald man with imposing presence. His black muscle tee clung to his frame, revealing the faint outline of a dragon tattoo on his left arm. A gold earring glinted sharply from his earlobe. Most striking was the voluptuous woman draped across his lap, his fingers tracing slow circles along her waist.

Jenna Roland stood at the doorway, her palms damp with sweat. She forced a professional smile. "Good evening, sir. I'm Jenna. It's a pleasure to serve you."

Tony Lombardi studied her through narrowed eyes. The woman was tall, her black pencil skirt revealing a glimpse of pale calf. He licked his molars, grinning. "New here? You're quite the looker."

"Yes, sir. This is my third day." Her voice remained soft, but her nails dug into her palms.

Tony patted the empty space beside him. "Come sit."

Jenna's breath hitched. The spot placed her dangerously close to the bald man, but refusal wasn't an option. She perched on the edge, maintaining distance, yet his overpowering cologne invaded her senses.

"What's good tonight?" Tony suddenly asked.

Relieved by the distraction, Jenna smoothly listed their premium selections. Her crisp enunciation and flawless terminology earned approving nods.

"Two bottles of the twenty-six thousand dollar one," he decided, then leaned in until his alcohol-laced breath warmed her ear. "But you'll drink with me."

From the corner of her eye, Jenna saw Fiona Valrose shooting daggers at her. She smiled coolly. "Won't your lady friend mind?"

Tony gripped Fiona's chin, his expression turning glacial. "Would she dare?"

Fiona instantly forced a simper. "Don't tease me, Tony."

A chill ran down Jenna's spine. This man's moods shifted like quicksilver—clearly not someone to cross. She stood, her skirt trembling slightly. "I'll retrieve your order."

Outside, Jenna pressed against the hallway wall, gasping. The mirrored surface reflected her ashen face. For one terrifying moment, she'd glimpsed genuine malice in Tony's eyes.

Back inside, Tony shoved Fiona aside and smirked at his lackeys. "This one's got spirit. Everyone stay sharp."
###Chapter 31

Jenna Roland stepped out of the private room, her stilettos clicking sharply against the marble floor.

She had just reached the stairwell when Stella Laurent grabbed her arm.

"Jenna!" Stella whispered urgently, her eyes filled with concern.

Jenna paused and turned to face her.

"Did Tony give you any trouble?" Stella squeezed her hand anxiously. "That guy's notorious for being difficult."

Jenna shook her head lightly. "It was fine. He just looks intimidating."

Stella exhaled in relief, then tensed again. "Remember, don't provoke him. If he gets handsy, just endure it."

Jenna patted the back of her hand. "I know how to handle myself."

"Oh," Jenna leaned closer to Stella's ear. "Tony ordered two bottles of Romanée-Conti. Fifty-two thousand."

Stella's eyes widened, nearly gasping aloud.

"Two bottles? Fifty-two grand?" She sucked in a sharp breath. "My God! Your commission tonight must be insane!"

Jenna smiled faintly. "I should go get the wine now."

She turned toward the cellar, her dress swirling gracefully behind her.

Inside the wine vault, Chloe Blanchet was retrieving a bottle. When she saw Jenna reaching for two premium reds, she nearly dropped her tray.

"Who's spending that kind of money?" Chloe asked, stunned.

Jenna replied casually, "Tony Lombardi."

Chloe's expression froze.

"Tony?" Her voice cracked. "That terrifying Tony?"

Jenna nodded and motioned for the server to follow.

Patrick Klein approached, frowning at the dazed Chloe. "What are you standing around for? The guests are waiting!"

Chloe snapped out of it and hurried away.

In Private Room 402, the crystal chandelier cast a soft glow.

Jenna uncorked the bottle with practiced elegance, the amber liquid cascading into the wineglass.

She lifted the glass and approached Tony Lombardi.

"Sir," her voice clear and bright, "this toast is for you. May your future shine bright with success and happiness."

Tony's smile abruptly stiffened.

He studied Jenna for several seconds, his gaze unreadable.

In his line of work—where survival meant walking on knife edges—no one had ever wished him such things.

He raised the glass and drained it in one go.
###Chapter 32

Tony Lombardi released his arm from Fiona Valrose's waist, gesturing for her to step aside.

He beckoned Jenna Roland over, patting the seat beside him.

Jenna's heart clenched. Her fingertips trembled slightly. She knew Tony's reputation too well—sitting there could mean trouble.

"Little sister," Tony took a sip of whiskey, his gaze unexpectedly softening. "In all my years in this business, no one's ever spoken to me as sincerely as you did. You're the first."

Jenna froze. She'd only uttered a few polite platitudes, yet they'd somehow shifted his entire demeanor.

"How could that be?" she asked cautiously. "Someone like you must have plenty of people trying to win your favor."

Tony gave a self-deprecating laugh. "My men are waiting for me to die. The bosses only want to use me. Even my wife's heart belongs to someone else." His expression turned serious. "I was wrong earlier. From now on, you're my real sister. Deal?"

Jenna was speechless.

Fiona nudged her. "What are you standing there for? Call him 'brother' already."

"Brother..." Jenna murmured softly, already calculating the benefits this title might bring.

Tony threw his head back with booming laughter, making the crystal chandelier sway. "Good! Tony Lombardi finally has a sister!"

He stood abruptly, scanning the room. "Listen up! From now on, she's me. Anyone who lays a finger on her—" He drew a finger across his throat.

A chill ran down Jenna's spine.

The roomful of underlings bowed their heads in unison.

Resuming his seat, Tony personally poured Jenna a drink. "Anything you need, just ask your brother."

"Thank you, brother." She accepted the glass and downed it in one go.

They exchanged contact information. After several more rounds, Jenna finally managed to excuse herself.

Stepping out of the private room, she exhaled deeply. She'd entered trembling with fear—now she'd gained a "brother."

In the hallway, she encountered Patrick Klein, who eyed her nervously. "He didn't give you trouble?"

"Actually, it went well." Jenna blinked. "He just adopted me as his sister."

Patrick's eyes widened. "What?"

"Oh," Jenna added casually, "he also ordered two bottles of Romanée-Conti."

Patrick's walkie-talkie clattered to the floor. Twenty-six thousand dollar wines, just like that? What kind of magic had this girl worked on Tony?
###Chapter 33

Patrick Klein stared at the bill on his computer screen, fingers tapping lightly on the desk.

"How unusual. Tony Lombardi actually acknowledged you as his little sister."

He looked up at Jenna Roland, surprise flickering in his eyes.

Jenna stood before his desk, hands clasped in front of her.

"I didn’t expect it either."

Patrick suddenly laughed, the wrinkles on his face smoothing out.

"Well, this works out perfectly. From now on, you’ll handle him whenever he comes. Saves the others from hiding."

Jenna pressed her lips together.

"He’s not that scary, really."

Patrick stood and patted her shoulder.

"Congratulations. Your commission this time is over fifty grand."

Jenna gave a slight bow.

"Thank you, Mr. Klein."

"Go take a break."

Jenna turned and left the office, taking the elevator down to the staff lounge.

She had just settled onto the couch when the door swung open.

Tristan Ashcroft strode in, a sheen of sweat on his forehead.

"Did Tony Lombardi do anything to you?"

His voice was tight with tension.

Jenna stood, a flicker of confusion in her eyes.

"How did you know I was the one handling him?"

Tristan pulled out his phone and waved it.

"Stella Laurent texted me."

He dropped heavily onto the couch and fished a cigarette from his pocket.

The flame from his lighter danced at his fingertips.

"What was Patrick thinking, sending you of all people?"

Smoke curled around his furrowed brows.

Jenna spoke softly.

"Everyone else was busy. I’d just finished with another client."

Tristan took a deep drag, his gaze sharp.

"Did he touch you?"

Jenna shook her head.

"No. He called me his little sister and ordered two bottles of Romanée-Conti."

Tristan’s fingers twitched, ash scattering on his pants.

"What?"

His head snapped up, disbelief flooding his expression.

Jenna nodded earnestly.

"It’s true."

Tristan stubbed out the cigarette, his voice low.

"Why would he..."

His fingers drummed absently on his knee.

"I don’t know why he ordered such expensive wine," Jenna murmured. "As for the sister thing, I just said some kind words."

Tristan studied her for a long moment.

"As long as you’re unharmed."

He stood, straightening his suit jacket.

"Next time, give me a heads-up."

Jenna nodded.

"Understood, sir."

At the door, Tristan turned back with a final warning.

"Remember—avoid him if you can."

When the door closed, Jenna exhaled deeply and sank back into the couch.
###Chapter 34

After Tristan Ashcroft left, Jenna Roland collapsed onto the couch, her body finally relaxing.

The $6,000 commission made her heart race.

The money had come too fast. At this rate, she'd soon have enough for Milo's surgery.

Too bad she couldn't tell her brother she worked at a club.

News traveled fast.

Within an hour, word of Jenna selling $26,000 worth of wine spread through Studio 54.

Her commission broke the club's record.

Envious glances mixed with jealousy.

A newcomer earning so much in just three days? Who wouldn't be bitter?

At closing time, coworkers clamored for her to treat them.

Jenna hesitated.

She'd risked everything for that money.

But to keep the peace, she reluctantly agreed to take them to a street food stall.

At 2 a.m., thirty people descended on the food street.

They picked a popular spot and took up four tables.

Four crates of beer and a feast of dishes were ordered.

Stella Laurent sidled up. "With this crowd, you're bleeding cash tonight."

Jenna kept her expression blank. "It's fine."

She couldn't back out now.

Or they'd call her stingy, making future work harder.

Sophia Merouin sat beside Tristan, eyeing Jenna meaningfully. "Never thought you'd charm Tony."

Chloe Blanchet cut in. "And he called her 'little sister.' How bizarre."

Patrick Klein feigned concern. "I was worried you couldn't handle it."

Jenna forced a smile. "Thanks for your concern."

"That's how this industry works. Gain more experience," Patrick said.

When the food arrived, toasts began.

Jenna held her liquor well, accepting every drink.

Tristan intervened. "Let her eat something."

With the boss speaking up, no one dared push further.

As Jenna picked up her chopsticks, her phone lit up.

Tony Lombardi's message appeared: Off work? We're having late-night snacks. Join us?
###Chapter 35

Jenna Roland's phone screen lit up. She quickly unlocked it to reply.

"Tony, don't trouble yourself. We're having dinner out with colleagues."

He responded instantly. "Where?"

"At a street food stall on Fifth Avenue."

The moment she sent the message, her phone vibrated.

Tony Lombardi had transferred $20,000.

Jenna stared at the number on the screen, her fingers trembling slightly.

"Tony, what’s this for?"

A new message popped up immediately. "Be generous when treating colleagues. Use this for dinner. If you ever need money, just ask. I’ve got plenty to spare!"

Warmth spread through her chest.

Just yesterday, she’d considered him dangerous.

Who would’ve thought this man she’d met by chance—who’d spent a fortune on drinks and genuinely treated her like a sister—would now send her such an enormous sum without hesitation?

Apart from Sean and Milo, no one had ever shown her this kind of care.

"Tony, money doesn’t grow on trees. Really, you don’t have to."

She quickly tapped "Refund."

Another notification chimed, accompanied by an angry emoji.

"You’re not treating me like family, huh? Older brothers are supposed to spoil their sisters! If you don’t take it, I’ll be pissed!"

Jenna sighed in resignation.

This man was determined to shower her with money.

"Then… thank you, Tony."

"No need for thanks! Enjoy your meal. We’ll talk later."

Putting her phone away, she rejoined her colleagues, clinking glasses and laughing.

The late-night feast lasted until 4 a.m.

When the bill came—over $2,000—Jenna swiped her card without flinching.

It was the most extravagant meal she’d ever paid for.

But since she’d offered to treat everyone, she wouldn’t complain.

Tristan Ashcroft lit a cigarette. "Where do you live? I’ll drive you."

Out of the corner of her eye, Jenna caught Sophia Merouin’s dark expression.

"No need." She refused firmly.

Tristan didn’t press further, driving off with Sophia.

Nathaniel Vance approached her. "Let me take you. It’s hard to get a cab this late."

Jenna nodded. "Thanks."

She slid into the passenger seat.
###Chapter 36

Neon lights flickered outside the club as night deepened.

Stella Laurent stood by the roadside in her high heels, waving at several taxis that ignored her. She turned toward a black sedan that had just started its engine. "Nathaniel, can I hitch a ride? You're heading my way, right?"

Nathaniel Vance rolled down the window and confirmed the address. Stella slid into the backseat, settling beside Jenna Roland.

As the car merged onto the main road, Nathaniel glanced at Jenna through the rearview mirror. "The boss offered to drive you home. Why didn't you take him up on it?"

Jenna kept her eyes on the blur of city lights outside. "Sophia looked ready to skin me alive."

"Damn right!" Stella crossed her legs. "That woman's possessive as hell. If you'd gotten in his car, she'd have made your life miserable tomorrow."

Jenna scoffed. "No point stirring up trouble."

Nathaniel turned the steering wheel. "You know about their... arrangement?"

"Heard rumors." Jenna tapped her fingers against the window frame.

Nathaniel lowered his voice. "Plenty of girls at the club have crushes on the boss, but none dare act on it. Last month, a new girl didn't get the memo. Sophia cornered her in the alley the next day—"

"Seven stitches in her skull." Stella mimed smashing a bottle.

Jenna arched an eyebrow. "That vicious?"

"Girl vanished after that." Stella shrugged. "So yeah, steer clear of those two."

Jenna narrowed her eyes. She wasn't one to back down from conflict, but she hadn't come to the club to get entangled in drama. Money was her only objective.

The car pulled up at Beverly Hills.

Jenna thanked them and stepped out, watching the taillights disappear. She eased the front door open, careful not to wake Milo if he was waiting up.

The living room lay in darkness. She fumbled for the wall switch. The sofa stood empty.

When she pushed her bedroom door open, her breath caught—

Ethan Roscente lay asleep in her bed.

A black suitcase leaned against the nightstand, its zipper half-open to reveal men's dress shirts. Jenna froze, her nails digging into her palms.

Was he actually moving in?

Moonlight at 5:30 AM filtered through the sheer curtains as she mechanically towel-dried her hair, catching her pale reflection in the bathroom mirror.

Clutching a thin blanket, she moved toward the living room couch like a sleepwalker.
###Chapter 37

At 6:30 in the morning, Milo Roland rubbed his sleepy eyes as he entered the living room.

Seeing Jenna Roland curled up asleep on the sofa, he walked past her toward the bathroom without a second thought.

The sound of running water filled the air as Milo finished washing up. He changed into his school uniform and headed to the kitchen.

Ethan Roscente appeared in the living room, adjusting his cufflinks. His gaze briefly swept over Jenna on the sofa before he strode toward the bathroom.

By the time a steaming bowl of plain noodle soup was placed on the table, Ethan had just finished drying his hair.

"Mr. Roscente, I made noodles," Milo said, handing him chopsticks with slightly nervous hands.

Ethan accepted them, his eyes dropping to the bowl in front of him.

Slender white noodles swam in amber broth, topped with vibrant green scallions and a fried egg with crisp golden edges.

The savory aroma lingered in the air.

He took a bite. The noodles had the perfect chew, and the broth was rich with umami.

Milo kept his head down, quietly slurping his noodles.

"Aren't you going to wake her?" Ethan's voice was icy.

Milo glanced at his sleeping sister. "She got home late from her night shift. Let her rest."

"Where does she work?" Ethan paused mid-bite.

"A 24-hour convenience store," Milo answered without hesitation.

A flicker of mockery crossed Ethan's eyes.

This woman didn't even blink when lying.

"High school sophomore?" Ethan abruptly changed the subject.

Milo's hand jerked, nearly dropping his noodles. "Y-yes."

Ethan set down his chopsticks and stood to leave.

Only after the front door closed did Milo finally exhale in relief.

His sister had said Ethan was a company executive, but his presence was more intimidating than their school principal.

As Milo cleared the table, he couldn't help stealing another glance at Jenna on the sofa.

How was his sister going to survive living with this man?

......

A shrill ringtone yanked Jenna from her dreams.

"Hello?" she mumbled, fumbling for her phone.

"Hey sis, I'm eating at a friend's place. Don't wait for me at lunch," Milo's voice came through the receiver.
###Chapter 38

"Got it."

Jenna hung up the phone and rubbed her sleepy eyes. She picked up her phone again and dialed Ethan's number.

The call connected almost immediately.

"Mr. Roscente, will you be back for lunch? Alright."

Next, she called Grandma Blanche, who was busy playing mahjong at the senior center and wouldn't be home for lunch.

After washing up, Jenna changed into loungewear and headed to the kitchen. If Ethan weren't coming back, she would've just made instant noodles. But now she had to prepare three dishes and a soup.

Ethan returned at half past noon.

"Lunch is ready. Please wash your hands first."

He responded with a cold hum, his gaze icy.

Every time she met those emotionless eyes, Jenna felt a chill run down her spine.

She served the rice and handed him the chopsticks only after he sat down. The dining table was eerily quiet, the clinking of utensils the only sound.

"You didn't tell your brother you work at a club?" Ethan suddenly spoke.

Jenna's head snapped up, her pulse quickening. "You told him?"

"No."

She exhaled in relief. If Milo found out she worked at such a place, he'd raise hell.

"I don't have that kind of free time." His tone dripped with disdain.

Jenna lowered her head and silently finished her rice.

"Mr. Roscente," she mustered the courage to speak, "can we sleep separately for now? I'm not ready."

"You want to sleep on the floor?" He blew out a smoke ring, looking down at her.

Jenna froze. So he'd already planned to make her sleep on the floor.

"Yes. I'll take the floor." Her reply was firm.

After a pause, she added cautiously, "I have work at night, so I might not be able to make dinner..."

Ethan stubbed out his cigarette. "Do whatever you want."

He walked away, his back cold and distant.
###Chapter 39

At 6:40 p.m., Jenna Roland hurried into Studio 54, her heels clicking against the pavement. The glass doors reflected her slightly weary figure.

The lounge was already packed. Stella Laurent shot her a pointed look, signaling she was late.

"Sorry, I took a nap this afternoon," Jenna murmured, shoving her bag into a locker.

Patrick Klein clapped his hands, calling everyone for the daily briefing. After the meeting, Jenna was scheduled as the last performer.

Sophia Merouin lounged beside her, crossing her legs. Her red nail polish gleamed garishly under the lights.

"Word is, you're quite popular with the clients lately," Sophia said, her voice dripping with envy.

Jenna kept her eyes on her phone. "Just trying to make a living."

Sophia's phone rang. When she hung up, her gaze turned sharp.

"Jenna," she hissed, leaning closer. "The boss keeps mentioning you."

Jenna finally looked up, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "And?"

"Stay away from him." Sophia gritted her teeth. "Don't think I don't know what you're up to."

Jenna scoffed and returned to her phone. She'd heard these empty warnings too many times.

Patrick pushed the door open. "Jenna, a client in Room 204 requested you."

"Who is it?"

"Said he's your brother," Patrick added. "Same guy as last time."

Jenna frowned. What was Sean Roland doing here again? And with friends?

The door to Room 204 was slightly ajar. Jenna took a deep breath and stepped inside.

The room was hazy with smoke. Sean sat in the center, flanked by two unfamiliar men puffing on cigarettes.

"You're here." Sean waved her over. "These are my colleagues, Cheng Feng and Zheng Haocheng."

Zheng Haocheng immediately stood and extended his hand. "I've heard so much about you."

Jenna gave a reluctant handshake, recoiling at the clammy sweat on his palm.

"Your sister's even prettier than in the photos," Cheng Feng whistled. "Sean, you've been hiding her well."

Sean smacked the back of his head. "Keep your thoughts clean."

"What would you like to drink?" Jenna cut in, ending their banter.

"Three cases of Budweiser," Sean said. "Don't go overboard."

Jenna nodded and slipped out. The hallway lights flickered as she rubbed her temples.

When she returned with the drinks, Sean was gone. Cheng Feng held her brother's phone, grinning oddly.

"Where's Sean?" Jenna set the tray down.

Cheng Feng waved the phone. "Taking a call." His eyes raked over her. "Hey, can I get your number?"

Jenna took a step back, her spine pressing against the cold wall.
###Chapter 40

Sean Roland slumped onto the couch with careless ease. As he took the phone, he asked casually, "Who is it?"

Kevin Heilbronn grinned. "Your brother. Asked where you were. I said we're drinking at Studio 54. Also mentioned Jenna works here."

Sean's expression darkened instantly.

Kevin's smile froze. "What? Was I not supposed to say that?"

Sean's eyes turned icy. "They're sworn enemies. What do you think will happen now?"

"Shit!" Kevin leapt to his feet. "Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

A vein throbbed at Sean's temple.

How was he supposed to know it was Jason calling?

Byron Valdemar looked worried. "What do we do now?"

Sean massaged his forehead. "What can we do?"

Kevin hesitated. "Should I... make up an excuse?"

"Is he coming?"

"Yeah."

Sean scoffed. "Too late."

The private room door swung open.

Jenna walked in carrying a tray of drinks, followed by a server.

The moment the drinks were set down, Sean pulled her aside.

When she heard what happened, her hands trembled.

A beer bottle crashed to the floor, shards scattering everywhere.

If Jason found out she worked at a place like this, he'd make sure the entire Roland family knew.

Sean's voice was low. "Don't work tonight."

Jenna smirked. "Avoiding tonight won't solve tomorrow."

Sean pulled out his phone. "I'll tell him not to come."

The call connected.

"Jason, Kevin was joking. Don't take it seriously."

"Bro, I'm bringing Heidi over. We'll be there soon."

The line went dead.

Jenna had already grabbed a broom to sweep up the glass.

"Don't worry," she said, lips curving. "If he causes trouble, I'll have security throw him out."
###Chapter 41

Jenna Roland had only discovered last night that Tristan Ashcroft secretly maintained a team of bodyguards.

These bodyguards specialized in maintaining order at Studio 54, preventing any disturbances.

If Jason Roland dared to cause trouble, Tristan would deal with him before Jenna even had to speak.

Sean Roland nodded, gesturing for Jenna to sit and join the drinks.

She shook her head. "A guest has arrived. I need to attend to them."

"Go ahead." Sean didn’t press further.

Jenna hurried toward VIP Room 888.

She knocked lightly before entering.

Five impeccably dressed men sat inside, each exuding an air of sophistication.

Standing in the center, Jenna gave a slight bow. "Good evening. I'm Jenna Roland. It's my pleasure to serve you."

Oliver Macmillan, clad in a gray suit, looked her over. "Where's your boss?"

"He's occupied at the moment. Shall I notify him for you?"

Oliver crossed his legs. "Tell Ashcroft an old friend is here."

"Of course. One moment, please." Jenna excused herself.

Downstairs, she found Supervisor Patrick Klein and inquired about Tristan’s whereabouts.

"Who's asking?" Patrick questioned.

"The guest in Room 888. He claims to be the boss's friend."

"Just call him directly," Patrick suggested.

Jenna dialed Tristan’s number and briefly explained the situation.

"I'll be right there," came Tristan’s reply.

She returned to wait outside Room 888.

Soon, Tristan arrived in haste.

They entered the room together.

Oliver smirked. "Busy man. Hard to get an audience with you."

Tristan took a seat beside him. "Apologies. I was entertaining some associates."

Julian Richter interjected, "Macmillan insisted on seeing you. We couldn’t stop him."

"Had I known you were coming, I wouldn’t have wasted time with Wang Hai," Tristan said regretfully.

Oliver waved it off. "What’s good here?"

Tristan glanced at Jenna. "Show us what you've got."

She stepped forward and began fluently presenting the club’s beverage menu.
###Chapter 42

Oliver Macmillan tapped his fingers lightly on the table, scanning the wine list. "Four bottles of Royal Salute."

"Right away, sir." Jenna Roland gave a slight bow, the hem of her dress swaying gracefully as she turned.

Oliver slung an arm around Tristan Ashcroft's shoulder, a playful glint in his eyes. "Your hiring standards have improved."

Tristan swirled the amber liquid in his glass. "Meaning?"

Brian Durrant whistled. "He's saying you finally hired someone decent. Unlike those last few disasters who couldn't even sell water in a desert."

"Then why not order Romanée-Conti?" Tristan raised an eyebrow.

Oliver sighed. "The old man's been auditing my accounts. Allowance cut in half." He leaned in, lowering his voice. "Heard Tony Lombardi dropped fifty grand here last night?"

Julian Richter snapped his lighter shut. "That gangster?"

Tristan smirked. "Jenna sweet-talked him into calling her 'little sister' and made him open two bottles of Romanée-Conti." He tapped his temple. "That girl's got skills."

Oliver let out an appreciative whistle. "With that face and that body in that uniform..."

"Don't even think about it." Tristan's tone turned serious. "She's under Ethan Roscente's protection."

The room went dead silent.

Brian nearly dropped his glass. "Ethan Roscente? The 'Grim Reaper' of HM Group?"

Oliver swallowed hard. "The same guy who bankrupted a rival during the financial summit?"

Tristan tilted his phone, displaying a stark black-and-white message from this morning: Jenna is mine.

Julian suddenly chuckled. "Interesting. Since when does the second son of the Roscente family go for this type?"

Outside, neon lights flickered as Jenna carried a tray of drinks down the hallway. The crystal chandelier cast shimmering reflections on her collarbone, like a gilded bird in an ornate cage.
###Chapter 43

Oliver narrowed his eyes, fingers tapping rhythmically on the table. "Tristan, you're not joking with us, are you? Someone of Ethan Roscente's status getting involved with Jenna Roland?"

Julian and Zane exchanged skeptical glances.

Tristan exhaled a smoke ring, his smile cryptic through the haze. "Why would I lie? Brian, don't you know Gavin? Just call and verify."

Brian remained motionless, absently tracing the rim of his wine glass.

"If Jenna truly knows Ethan," Brian said suddenly, "haven't you considered leveraging that connection?"

Tristan sighed. "The Hudson Yards tender is coming up. My father's company is bidding, but the competition is brutal. I wanted Jenna to put in a good word..."

"Hudson Yards?" Brian's eyebrow arched. "That's prime real estate. Dozens of firms are fighting for it."

"Exactly." Tristan stubbed out his cigarette. "Without insider connections, it's impossible."

The private room door swung open.

Jenna entered carrying a tray of drinks, followed by two servers.

She expertly uncorked bottles and poured with practiced efficiency.

"So you know Ethan Roscente?" Brian's abrupt question made her hands falter.

Jenna's gaze flickered to Tristan before quickly lowering. "We're acquainted. Nothing more."

Her detached tone when mentioning Ethan drew knowing looks from the men.

"Leave after serving." Tristan dismissed her with a wave.

Jenna nodded and exited—only to freeze in the hallway.

Jason and Heidi stood nearby, sneering at her.

"I knew big brother was lying!" Heidi crowed. "This little bitch really works at a place like this!"

Jason eyed Jenna's uniform with contempt. "Dressed like this? How are you any different from those escort girls? If your parents knew—"

"I'm just a server!" Jenna's grip whitened around the tray.

"A server?" Jason laughed mockingly. "In that outfit?"

Stella emerged from the adjacent room, her face darkening at the insult.

She glanced down at her identical uniform, fury flashing in her eyes.
###Chapter 44

Stella Laurent clicked across the floor in her stilettos and positioned herself protectively in front of Jenna Roland.

Her red-lacquered nails pointed inches from Jason Roland's face. "Who the hell do you think you are? This is my turf."

Jason's face darkened, veins bulging at his temples. "You bitch looking for trouble?"

Stella smirked, crimson lips curling in contempt. "Go ahead. Take your best shot."

Jenna's eyes glistened with unshed tears, voice trembling. "Jason, get out!"

"Like hell I will!" Jason kicked over a decorative vase near the hallway.

Ethan Roscente emerged from the restroom just as the commotion started. He immediately doubled back to fetch Sean Roland.

When Sean arrived, Jason was screaming obscenities at Jenna.

Sean stepped between them, voice dangerously calm. "Enough. You're embarrassing yourself."

Jason gaped. "You're defending this slut? After what she did to our family?"

"Shut your mouth." Sean's voice cracked like a whip. "One more word and I'll handle you myself."

The club's pounding bass nearly drowned out the altercation until a neighboring VIP suite door swung open.

Tristan Ashcroft stepped out, phone in hand, scanning the scene with icy precision.

Stella seized the opportunity. "Boss, these two are causing problems."

Jason spat on the floor. "Big man with his little threats."

Tristan's expression hardened. He tapped his phone once.

Within sixty seconds, four hulking bodyguards blocked the corridor.

Heidi Roland cowered behind Jason.

"Throw them out." Tristan's voice could freeze lava. "Next time, break their legs."

Jason glared at Jenna. "This isn't over."

The bodyguards hauled them away like ragdolls.

Sean approached Tristan. "Mr. Ashcroft, my apologies—"

"Try that again," Tristan interrupted, "and you'll join them."

Sean pressed his lips together and gave a curt nod.
###Chapter 45

Tristan Ashcroft's gaze turned icy as he stared at Jenna Roland. His slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the desk, producing a dull thud.

"Why didn't you inform me immediately when trouble arose?"

If not for Stella Laurent's message, he wouldn't have known someone dared to cause a scene in his territory.

Jenna bit her lower lip, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her blouse.

"Boss, I thought I could handle it myself. I didn't expect them to be so persistent... I'm sorry for the inconvenience."

Tristan stood, looking down at her with an unreadable expression.

"Inconvenience? My primary concern is the safety of our guests—and yours."

A cold sweat formed on his back. This was Ethan Roscente's wife. If anything happened to her here, the consequences would be disastrous.

Jenna bowed deeply. "I sincerely apologize."

"Go." Tristan waved dismissively. "Take your brother back to the private room. Don't disturb the other guests."

Nodding, Jenna quickly pulled Sean Roland away.

The moment the door closed behind them, Jenna's face paled. She leaned against the door, her chest heaving.

"Big brother... he knows. He'll spread rumors everywhere."

Her voice trembled as her fingers clenched the fabric of her clothes.

Sean frowned. "Maybe you should quit? Once gossip like this starts circulating—"

"No!" Jenna's head snapped up. "Milo's surgery still needs over a million. There are follow-up treatments too. If I quit now..."

Her voice cracked, eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Sean raked a hand through his hair in frustration. The money in his account wasn't even enough to cover a fraction.

"Quit first. We'll figure out the money somehow."

Jenna shook her head, tears threatening to spill.

"We can't wait... The doctor said Milo's condition can't be delayed any longer."

Didn't she know this job would invite malicious gossip? But for her brother's sake, she had no other choice.

Sean exhaled heavily. 1.3 million—an astronomical sum for people like them.

"Maybe we could—"

Before he could finish, a sharp knock sounded at the door.
###Chapter 46

"You should go stop Jason first." Jenna paused, then shook her head. "Never mind. Let him be. I'll keep working here until Milo finds out."

She cared about nothing except her younger brother Milo.

As long as Milo remained unaware, everything was manageable.

Sean frowned. "You really don't care about their gossip?"

Jenna gave a bitter smile. "Big brother, when Milo and I were desperate, which one of them lifted a finger? Their opinions mean nothing to me now."

"If that's how you feel..." Sean picked up his coat. "I'll go check on things. I'll explain if needed."

"Don't bother." Her eyes turned icy. "Let them talk."

"You're my sister. I protect my family." Sean turned to Tristan and the others. "Continue without me. We'll meet another time."

Without waiting for a response, he strode out of the private room.

Tristan looked guilty. "Jenna, I'm sorry. I didn't know you—"

"What's done is done." She cut him off. "No point hiding it now. Enjoy yourselves. I have work to do."

Sophia nodded silently, watching Jenna leave before raising her glass again.

......

In the Roland family living room, Jason was dramatically recounting Jenna's "escort work" at the club.

Sean entered with a dark expression. "She sells drinks. That's not the same as being an escort."

Jason sneered and turned to Victor. "Dad, look! Big brother's still defending that bitch!"

"Shut your mouth!" Sean's eyes flashed dangerously. "After all these years of her slaving for you, this is how you repay her?"

Victor slammed the table. "You insolent brat! Who's your real brother? Taking an outsider's side—have you no shame?"

"Outsider?" Sean laughed coldly. "Dad, whose orchard is it? Whose pockets have been lined with its profits? Jenna cooks, cleans, pays rent and living expenses here. Where's your conscience?"

Victor's face turned purple with rage. Fiona looked ashen.

"Her father was your own brother!" Sean's words struck like daggers. "She shares our blood and name. Call her an outsider again—see if you can face our ancestors in the afterlife."

"You ungrateful wretch!" Victor hurled a teacup at him. "Keep defending that slut, and you can get out too!"
###Chapter 47

Sean clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white.

He never imagined his own family could be so despicable.

Fiona shrieked, "Sean, we're your blood relatives! How dare you take their side over ours?"

Jason sneered, "Having a brother like you is downright embarrassing."

Sean's chest heaved with barely contained rage.

His icy gaze swept over them as he growled, "What you did to Jenna will come back to haunt you."

Without another word, he turned on his heel and left.

Victor chased him to the doorway, bellowing, "Ungrateful wretch! Don't you dare come back!"

The elevator doors closed just as Sean's eyes finally reddened.

Back in the living room, Victor slammed the door violently.

"That traitor! Defending that little slut!"

Heidi chimed in with false concern, "If word gets out about Jenna working as an escort at Studio 54, we'll be the laughingstock of Los Angeles."

Fiona's eyes gleamed with greed. "Those places must pay well, right?"

Jason scoffed. "High-end clubs like that? Thousands per night, easy."

"Disgusting!" Victor spat. "I wouldn't touch that dirty money!"

Fiona lowered her voice. "That sickly Milo won't last much longer. Maybe we could..."

Heidi caught on immediately. "If we control Milo, Jenna will have to pay up."

Jason suddenly pounded the table. "I've got it!"

He whipped out his phone. "We'll demand $40,000 hush money, or we'll expose her escort gig!"

The moment he hit send, a red exclamation mark appeared.

"Damn it!" Jason exploded. "That bitch blocked me!"

Heidi's face darkened. "What just happened?"
###Chapter 48

Fiona Roland gnashed her teeth while scrolling through her phone. "She must have deleted me the day she moved out."

Jason Roland's face darkened. "Mom, Heidi, check if she's blocked you too."

They frantically pulled out their phones.

The results were shocking—not only were Fiona and Heidi deleted, but Victor Roland's WeChat had also been blocked by Jenna!

"That ungrateful wretch!" Victor slammed the table. "After all these years raising her, she treats us like this? Even a dog would show more loyalty!"

Heidi looked grim. "Since WeChat's gone, we'll have to call."

Jason immediately dialed Jenna's number.

A cold automated voice responded: "The number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."

Four attempts yielded the same result.

"Bitch!" Jason snarled, hanging up. "She blocked my number!"

Fiona and Heidi tried calling too—same automated message.

Clearly, Jenna had blacklisted the entire family.

"That little snake has nerve!" Fiona stomped her foot in fury.

Heidi suddenly remembered something. "Wait, I have a new number."

She quickly dialed Jenna using the fresh line.

This time, it connected.

"Hello, this is Jenna Roland," came the familiar voice.

Heidi shoved the phone at Jason.

"It's me," Jason said icily.

Jenna, working at Studio 54, instantly tensed at his voice.

"What do you want?" Her tone was frigid.

"We know you're working as an escort at that club," Jason threatened. "Transfer $4,000 immediately unless you want Milo to find out. Or should I expose your dirty little secret to everyone?"

Jenna took a sharp breath. "It's too loud here. I'll call you back."

She hung up and hurried to find Stella Laurent.

"Let me borrow your phone," she said urgently.

Stella frowned but handed it over. "What's wrong?"

"Open WeChat, quick." Jenna pressed.

Though confused, Stella unlocked her device.
###Chapter 49

Jenna Roland scrolled through Stella Laurent's WeChat moments before dialing Jason Roland's number.

He answered instantly.

"It was too noisy earlier. If you're feeling generous, repeat what you said."

"I said everyone knows you work as an escort at Studio 54! Transfer me $4,000 right now, or I'll make sure Milo finds out and the whole world points fingers at you!"

Jason's voice dripped with malice.

Jenna tightened her grip on the phone, suppressing her fury.

"So you're threatening to spread lies about me working at a club unless I pay you?"

She enunciated every word.

"Lies? You are an escort! Stop pretending to be innocent!"

"I'm a licensed beverage promoter. What you're doing is extortion and defamation. Know the law?"

"Bullshit! Who's extorting you?"

"Your entire demand just now constitutes both crimes. I recorded it. Want to hear?"

Jason choked on his water.

"You bitch, say that again!"

"Listen carefully."

The playback of his exact words echoed through the line.

He hurled his phone across the room.

"Mom! That bitch recorded me! She's accusing me of extortion!"

Fiona Roland frantically searched the legal penalties on her phone.

The results drained the color from her face.

Extortion over $3,000 carried a 3-10 year sentence plus fines.

Heidi Roland shrieked, "That sly little witch set us up!"

Jason paced like a caged animal. "What do we do now?"

Victor Roland's expression darkened. "Leak her escort rumors anyway."

"But she called it defamation..."

Heidi scoffed. "What's the worst that could happen?"

Fiona checked defamation laws.

Malicious false accusations meant detention and fines.

"We get no money and no revenge!"

She smashed her phone against the wall.

......

Studio 54 lounge.
###Chapter 50

Stella Laurent's eyes widened as she listened to Jenna Roland's plan. "This is brilliant! You've got them completely trapped!"

Jenna backed up the voice recording and handed the phone back to Stella. "Don't celebrate yet. Those people would do anything for money."

She knew her relatives too well—they'd sell their dignity for a quick buck.

The most important thing now was keeping Milo in the dark.

Patrick Klein pushed the door open. "Jenna, the guest in VIP 309 requested you specifically."

"Regular?" Jenna asked casually.

"New face." Patrick wiped his brow. "Everyone else is busy, so you're our only option."

"Got it." Jenna adjusted her collar and headed straight for the private room.

Patrick turned to Stella. "Heard someone came looking for trouble with Jenna?"

Stella nodded. "Her cousin and his wife. Security kicked them out."

Patrick hummed thoughtfully before walking away.

——

At 3:30 AM, Jenna dragged her exhausted body home.

The living room was empty—Milo must already be asleep in his room.

She pushed open her bedroom door to find Ethan Roscente sprawled across her bed again.

Great. Another night on the floor.

After washing up, Jenna pulled spare bedding from the closet and collapsed onto the makeshift bed.

——

The next morning, Ethan opened his eyes to see Jenna curled up on the floor.

At least she knew her place.

He freshened up, changed clothes, and headed for the door.

Milo intercepted him in the living room with a bowl of plain noodle soup. "Mr. Roscente, I made breakfast—"

"No." Ethan brushed past without a backward glance.

The slam of the front door made Milo's stomach twist.

Had Jenna upset him again? Yesterday he'd eaten the noodles she cooked—why the sudden cold shoulder?

Whatever. More for him.

Milo polished off two bowls until his stomach protested.

After cleaning the kitchen, he started a pot of soup for Jenna.

As he grabbed his backpack for school, his phone buzzed with an unknown number.

The text froze him in place:

"Your sister works as an escort at Studio 54. See for yourself."

His trembling fingers dialed the number—disconnected.

Legs wobbling, he stared at the master bedroom door.

But Jenna said she worked night shifts at the convenience store...
###Chapter 51

Milo Roland had always believed his sister worked night shifts at a convenience store.

Until today.

He stood before the gilded entrance of "Studio 54," watching Jenna walk through the revolving doors in a revealing uniform. Neon lights flickered behind her, illuminating her exhausted face forced into a practiced smile.

His heart twisted violently.

Clutching his chest, he staggered back. The congenital heart disease made it hard to breathe, his vision darkening at the edges.

She was doing this for him.

For his expensive medications. For his monthly checkups. She had sacrificed her dignity, stepping into this world of decadence.

"It's all my fault..."

The teenage boy collapsed onto a nearby bench, tears blurring his sight. His uncle's venomous words echoed in his mind: "You're nothing but a burden!"

His phone buzzed.

A message from Jenna: "Milo, coming home for dinner?"

With trembling fingers, he replied: "No, sis. Eating at a friend's place."

After sending it, he wiped his tears and headed toward the distant bus stop.

Jenna Roland woke to sunlight streaming through the windows.

The rice cooker in the kitchen glowed with its "keep warm" light, the aroma of steamed rice filling the air. She massaged her aching lower back—last night's escort shift had ended at 3 AM, leaving her body feeling shattered.

Her phone screen lit up.

"Mr. Roscente, will you be home for lunch?" She hesitated before sending the text.

No immediate reply.

Jenna began preparing lunch. The crisp sound of chopping greens filled the kitchen, but her mind drifted back to last night's greasy client.

Ding—

Ethan's delayed response arrived: "Yes."

A single word, just like their marriage.

At exactly noon, the front door unlocked. Jenna was stir-frying the final dish when she glanced over her shoulder.

Ethan stood in the foyer, impeccably dressed in his tailored suit, his sharp features unreadable.

"Almost done," she said softly.

They ate in silence across from each other. Jenna pushed the rice bowl toward him. Ethan accepted it with refined movements, beginning his meal without a word.

The unnatural calm lasted ten minutes.

"Does the house need anything else?" Ethan suddenly asked.

Her chopsticks stilled. "Everything's taken care of."

"Your clothes?" His dark eyes lifted, fathomless.

Her grip tightened on the chopsticks, nails digging into her palms.

This marriage was transactional. He needed a wife to appease his family. She needed money for Milo's treatment. Nothing more.

"I have enough," Jenna murmured, avoiding his gaze.

Ethan's attention lingered on her frayed collar for a fleeting second before he resumed eating.

Silence reclaimed the dining room.

Only the occasional clink of chopsticks against porcelain reminded them of this hollow union.
###Chapter 52

Jenna declined Ethan's offer.

"Mr. Roscente, I have enough clothes. Please don't waste your money."

Ethan's gaze swept over the sparse contents of her closet. The faded fabrics looked worse than rags in his eyes.

On the shoe rack, a pair of worn cloth shoes had frayed edges. The only pair of leather shoes had peeling patches of lacquer.

He couldn't comprehend how anyone could live so frugally in this day and age.

"Though this is a marriage of convenience, I won't neglect my obligations."

Jenna lowered her lashes, fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her shirt.

"Mr. Roscente, I truly want nothing from this marriage. I didn't deceive Grandma Blanche."

A flicker of mockery passed through Ethan's eyes. If she hadn't schemed somehow, why would the old woman force him to marry a complete stranger?

"Hmph."

That cold scoff made Jenna's heart clench. She suddenly realized explanations would only deepen the misunderstanding.

Silently, she gathered the dishes and retreated to the kitchen.

When she emerged, the living room stood empty.

After a two-hour nap, Jenna left with a shopping bag.

She chose the cheaper farmers' market. Every penny saved meant another reference book for Milo.

Her phone rang abruptly.

"Grandma?"

"Dear, your grandfather and I are coming for lunch tomorrow."

Jenna's lips curved unconsciously. "Of course. What does Grandpa like?"

"The old man loves cola chicken wings and braised pork knuckles. Just make sure they're tender—his teeth aren't what they used to be."

Hanging up, Jenna felt surprised. She hadn't expected Grandpa Harrison's tastes to match Milo's so closely.

At the fresh produce stall, she meticulously selected the plumpest chicken wings.

After a hurried dinner, Jenna rushed to Studio 54.

The moment she entered, her phone rang again.

Caller ID: Lily Evans.

"Hello, Lily?"
###Chapter 53

"Jenna, why isn't Milo in class today?" Lily Evans' voice carried clear confusion through the phone.

Jenna Roland halted mid-step, her brows knitting together. "That's impossible. He never skips school."

"The homeroom teacher asked me to check with you. He's definitely absent." Lily's tone left no room for doubt.

Jenna ended the call abruptly and dialed her brother's number.

"The number you have dialed is currently switched off—" The robotic female voice made her pulse spike.

Her fingers turned icy as she called several of Milo's classmates in rapid succession.

"Haven't seen Milo."
"He didn't come to school today."
"Nobody's seen him since morning."

Each response landed like a hammer blow. Standing outside Studio 54, Jenna's grip on the phone trembled slightly.

When she dialed the last number, she barely dared to breathe.

"Hello?" The call connected instantly.

"Ryan, this is Milo's sister. Have you seen him today?"

"Oh, Jenna!" Ryan Watson's voice sounded weak. "Sorry, I'm running a fever. Milo's been taking care of me..."

Jenna exhaled sharply, the tension draining from her shoulders.

"Put him on."

A familiar voice came through moments later: "Sis."

"Do you have any idea how worried I was?" Jenna's voice shook. "Everyone said you'd vanished. I thought—"

"Ryan's family wasn't home, and his charger broke," Milo explained. "I'm sorry for scaring you."

"Next time, you call me first!" Jenna scolded sternly. "Come home early."

Only after hanging up did she notice her damp blouse clinging to her back.

"Trouble?" Stella Laurent approached, taking in Jenna's pale complexion.

Jenna gave a brief explanation.

"Honestly," Stella shook her head, "Milo's the most responsible kid I know. Stop imagining worst-case scenarios."

"But he never turns off his phone..." Jenna muttered defensively.

"Enough. Go change." Stella tugged her toward the staff area. "We've got that tedious staff meeting tonight."

In the locker room, Jenna mechanically changed into her uniform. By seven, when the meeting ended and guests began arriving, her heartbeat had finally steadied.
###Chapter 54

The night deepened as the clock struck eight.

Jenna Roland had just bid farewell to her last customer. She descended the stairs in her high heels to fetch more wine.

When she spotted the figure by the bar, her entire body froze as if struck by lightning.

Her phone slipped from her fingers, clattering loudly against the marble floor.

Stella Laurent rushed over at the noise. Following Jenna's gaze, she gasped. "Holy shit!"

"Milo?" Her eyes widened. "What are you doing here?"

The teenager's fists clenched, veins bulging. Shock and anguish swirled in his eyes.

That morning, he'd left with nothing but guilt weighing on him—the belief that he'd burdened his sister.

A classmate's call had interrupted his suicidal thoughts.

He'd spent the entire day at his friend's house, desperately convincing himself that text message was fake.

Yet an unshakable unease had driven him to the club for answers.

The sight before him shattered all his illusions.

Milo turned and bolted into the night.

"Milo!" Jenna abandoned her phone, hiking up her dress as she chased after him.

Patrick Klein approached with a frown. "What's going on?"

"That's her brother." Stella stomped her foot in frustration. "All our secrecy for nothing!"

"Her brother?" Patrick's expression darkened.

Stella was already pulling out her phone. "We need to call the boss."

Jenna caught her brother's sleeve at the alley entrance.

"Let me explain." Her voice trembled.

Milo shook her off, his eyes bloodshot. "A convenience store? You lied to me!"

"What text?" Jenna froze.

"Doesn't matter!" His voice cracked. "I'd rather die than have you sell yourself for money!"

Their parents' dying words echoed in his ears.

Jenna raised three fingers in desperation. "I only sell drinks! May lightning strike me if I'm lying!"

"Sis..." Tears splashed onto the pavement.

As he tried to leave again, a figure blocked his path.

Tristan Ashcroft had appeared silently at the alley's mouth.

"Boss." Jenna hung her head in shame.

"It's fine." Tristan studied the boy. "You're Jenna's brother?"

At Milo's stiff nod, he extended a hand. "Tristan Ashcroft. Owner of Studio 54."

Milo hesitated before shaking it.

"Let's talk inside." Tristan stepped aside. "This isn't the place."

Jenna watched her brother's expression nervously.

After a long silence, Milo finally took a step forward.
###Chapter 55

Tristan Ashcroft led the Roland siblings to VIP room 308 on the third floor. The space instantly brightened as the lights flickered on.

He strode to the sofa and sat down, gesturing to the empty seats beside him. "Make yourselves comfortable."

Milo and Jenna exchanged glances before cautiously taking their seats.

Milo clenched his fists, his Adam's apple bobbing several times before he spoke. "My sister..." His voice trailed off, face twisting with discomfort.

Tristan crossed his legs, leaning back lazily against the cushions. His clear gaze locked onto Milo's. "Studio 54 employs professional escorts, but your sister is a beverage promoter." He pointed to Jenna's uniform. "This is her work attire. Decent people see it for what it is—just clothing."

When Milo's frown remained, Tristan added, "If anyone harasses her, they'll answer to me. That goes for all my employees. Every dollar she earns here is clean."

"Are you just covering for her?" Milo's voice tightened with suspicion. He couldn't shake the thought that Tristan's defense stemmed from Jenna's profitability.

Tristan chuckled suddenly. He patted Milo's shoulder. "Your sister is excellent at sales. She just moved two bottles worth over half a million. Any boss would value such an employee, wouldn't you agree?"

Milo pressed his lips together silently.

"Mind if I smoke?" Tristan produced a cigarette case. At Milo's tacit consent, he lit up and exhaled slowly, eyes narrowing through the haze. "Every employer appreciates profitable staff. But your sister's sharp—she never takes unnecessary risks. You'd know that better than anyone."

Milo's shoulders relaxed slightly as he recalled Jenna brandishing a kitchen knife during their uncle's confrontation.

"So she's really not... one of those girls?" Doubt still lingered in Milo's eyes.

Tristan tapped ash into a tray before proposing, "How about this? Work as a temp server tonight and observe her job firsthand."

Jenna's eyes widened abruptly, her handbag nearly slipping from her grasp.
###Chapter 56 

Jenna's fingertips trembled slightly.

She wasn't afraid of gossip, but the thought of those lecherous stares and vulgar remarks made her chest tighten.

What worried her more was Milo's reaction. Though those men wouldn't dare touch her, their eyes felt like slimy snake tongues crawling over her skin.

If her brother witnessed this, even if he believed she was just selling drinks, he'd never let her stay in a place like this.

"Is Stella also a beverage promoter?" Milo suddenly asked, his gaze landing on Stella's identical uniform.

Jenna nodded. "Yes, we're in the same team."

Tristan blew a smoke ring, smirking. "Our escort girls wear much less than your sister. Want to take a look?"

"Boss!" Jenna glared at him. "My brother's still a student."

"The school uniform gives it away." Tristan flicked his cigarette ash, his eyes darting between the siblings.

Milo tightened his grip on his backpack strap. "Sis, this place is too shady."

"I understand your concern." Jenna softened her tone. "But the boss is always here, and there are bouncers keeping order. No one would dare misbehave."

"You're really planning to keep working here?" Milo's voice strained.

Jenna's eyes lit up. "The commission is high. Last time with those two bottles of fifty-thousand-dollar wine, I made over five grand." She counted on her fingers. "At this rate, I'll save up enough soon."

"Five thousand?" Milo gasped. That amount equaled half a year's salary for most people.

Tristan interjected, "A hundred grand is nothing. If she puts in effort, she could earn that in two months." He added meaningfully, "Not everyone can get Mr. Roscente and Tony to foot the bill."

Milo's expression darkened. "But what about your reputation? The relatives' gossip alone could drown you."

He thought of their uncle's family's sneering faces, his throat tightening with bitterness. They already looked down on them. If they found out Jenna worked here, who knew what vile things they'd say?
###Chapter 57

"Milo, do you remember how Uncle Victor treated us after Mom and Dad passed away?" Jenna Roland grasped her younger brother's hand, her voice barely above a whisper.

Milo lowered his head, fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of his shirt.

"The other relatives are even worse." Jenna gave a bitter smile. "Not kicking us while we're down is the best we can hope for."

She took a deep breath and met his eyes. "We can only rely on ourselves now. Money is everything—especially for your surgery."

Milo's lashes trembled.

"I don't have the education for a high-paying job." Jenna's tone remained steady. "But you... your future is still ahead of you."

His head jerked up, eyes red-rimmed. "Jenna—"

"I'm your sister." She cut him off, firm. "Your health is all that matters to me."

She wiped the tear from his cheek. "Remember—staying alive is the only thing that counts."

Milo suddenly threw himself into her arms, voice breaking. "I'm sorry... I've been so selfish..."

Jenna gently patted his back.

Then he abruptly pulled away and dropped to his knees before Tristan Ashcroft.

"What are you doing?" Tristan scrambled to his feet.

"Mr. Ashcroft." Milo's voice shook. "Please... protect my sister."

Tristan yanked him upright. "A man's pride is worth more than gold!"

"My parents are gone..." Milo whispered, barely audible.

Tristan studied the siblings with conflicted eyes.

"Where are you living now?" he asked.

Jenna answered first. "A rental."

Tristan frowned. "But you're married."

"Complications..." She evaded.

Milo shot her a puzzled glance.

"Call me anytime." Tristan's promise carried weight. "I'll keep an eye on her."

Milo bowed deeply.

After Tristan left, Jenna held out her hand. "Let me see that text."

"My phone died." Milo hesitated. "Why didn't you tell him we're staying at Ethan's?"

"Private matters." Her tone was flat.

He nodded. "Promise me you'll quit the club in two months."

"Deal." No hesitation.

"Does Ethan know you work at Studio 54?"

"He does." A humorless smile twisted her lips. "He even brought clients there."
###Chapter 58

"What?" Milo Roland's eyes widened in disbelief as he stared at his sister. "Mr. Roscente knows you work here? And he didn't object?"

Jenna lowered her lashes, her fingers absently tracing the hem of her uniform.

Her marriage to Ethan was nothing but a transaction.

To put it bluntly, they had a contractual arrangement that served their respective needs. He didn't truly care about her—why would he bother with such details?

But Ethan's opinion didn't matter. As long as Milo was okay with it, that was enough.

"He knows I'm just a server, not an escort," Jenna explained softly. "No job is beneath dignity as long as it's honest work."

"I can't believe he's actually been here," Milo mused.

"Exactly. If I were doing that kind of work, he would've divorced me long ago," Jenna quipped lightly.

Milo nodded. "Sis, I don't have classes tomorrow. I'll wait here tonight so we can go home together."

He wanted to see her workplace and make sure no one was mistreating her.

"Alright."

As long as he didn't witness her working, she didn't mind.

"I should get back. If they catch me slacking off again, I'll get scolded." Jenna stood up.

Milo followed her downstairs and was directed to the staff lounge to wait.

Sophia Merouin walked past carrying a tray of drinks. Spotting the teenager in school uniform, she stopped Patrick Klein.

"Who's that?"

"Jenna's younger brother."

Sophia arched a brow. "Her real brother?"

"Of course." Patrick hurried away.

With a dismissive sniff, Sophia dropped the subject. She'd never liked Jenna anyway.

Milo charged his phone for thirty minutes until it reached 40%.

After another half hour, the battery was full.

As he returned the charger, a tall figure strode through the club's entrance.

Milo froze.

Though his sister had mentioned it, seeing it firsthand still shocked him.

Ethan Roscente stood there in an immaculate suit, followed by Gavin Valentine and two other men.

He stopped before Milo, frowning slightly. "What are you doing here?"

Gavin eyed the teenager curiously. "And this is...?"
###Chapter 59

Milo Roland never expected to run into Ethan Roscente here.

He quickly composed himself and spoke respectfully, "Mr. Roscente, I'm here to see my sister."

Ethan frowned slightly, a flicker of confusion in his eyes.

He had assumed Jenna kept her job at this club a secret from her family. Working at such a place wasn't exactly something to boast about.

Yet here was Milo.

Had she already come clean to them?

Gavin Valentine, noticing Ethan's silence, interjected curiously, "You two know each other?"

Milo's gaze shifted between them. "My sister introduced us, but we're not close."

"I see." Gavin nodded thoughtfully.

Ethan's cold stare fixed on Milo. "This isn't the place for you. Go home."

"I'm waiting for my sister to finish her shift." Milo stood his ground. "Don't mind me, Mr. Roscente."

Without another word, Ethan turned and led Gavin's group upstairs.

Milo watched them leave before heading toward the staff lounge.

Jenna had just finished delivering drinks and was about to look for Milo when Patrick Klein and Stella Laurent stopped her.

"Done for the night?" Patrick asked.

Jenna nodded. "Just finished."

"VIP 999 requested you specifically." Patrick gestured upstairs. "Don't keep them waiting."

"Who is it?" Jenna frowned.

Stella smirked. "Big client. Better hurry."

Without further questions, Jenna made her way to VIP 999.

The moment she pushed the door open, she froze.

Ethan and Gavin sat on the sofa.

Weren't they just here a few days ago?

This young master really had a thing for nightclubs.

Grandma Blanche always said her grandson was just reserved but had good character. What kind of respectable person frequented places like this?

Even if he only came to drink, it still didn't reflect well on him.

Gavin waved her over. "Why is your brother here?"

Jenna's pulse jumped. "You saw Milo?"

"He said he's waiting to walk you home." Gavin gave her a meaningful look. "He knows you work here?"

Jenna met his gaze steadily. "I earn my living honestly. Is there a problem?"

The blunt response left Gavin momentarily speechless.
###Chapter 60

"Fine." Gavin didn't press further.

The private room was dimly lit. Miles leaned closer to Ethan and whispered, "I heard this place has escort girls?"

It was his first time at Studio 54, and he wasn't familiar with the rules.

Jenna was about to respond when Ethan's icy gaze cut through the air. "What? Can't drink without company?"

Miles stiffened, forcing an awkward chuckle. "Just making sure we're properly entertained."

Gavin scoffed. "We never involve outsiders when drinking."

"Forget it then." Miles turned to Jenna. "What premium wines do you have?"

Jenna smoothly listed several labels with their prices, detailing each wine's tasting notes.

Gavin raised an eyebrow. "You've done your homework."

She smiled faintly. "Some guests ask. I have to be prepared."

"Two bottles of Romanée-Conti." Miles waved his hand. "And bring some snacks and fruits."

Tonight was about currying favor with Ethan. He needed to keep the man satisfied.

Jenna gave a slight bow. "Right away, sir."

As she exited, her mind reeled.

Two bottles of Romanée-Conti? Miles was splurging.

Ethan was just a regular manager who usually ordered mid-range wines. Who knew he had such influential connections?

Passing the lounge, she spotted Milo glued to his phone game.

"Sis!" His eyes lit up. "Did you see Mr. Roscente?"

"Hosting him now." She ruffled his hair. "Hungry?"

"Nah, gaming."

"Call if you need me."

At the bar, Tristan intercepted her.

"You're handling VIP 999?"

"Yes. Mr. Roscente's party." She nodded. "They ordered two Romanée-Conti."

Tristan frowned. "Miles' doing?"

"Mm-hmm."

"Got it." His expression turned thoughtful. "Deliver promptly."

Miles was the fourth son of the Valentines, a startup founder desperate for resources. Clearly here to suck up to Ethan.

He watched Jenna's retreating figure, hesitating before looking away.

Soon, she returned with the wine and appetizers.
###Chapter 61

Jenna's slender fingers twisted open the cork of the red wine. Amber liquid cascaded into the decanter, releasing tiny bubbles. She arranged the nuts on a platter with the grace of a high-end restaurant server.

Gavin swirled his glass, ice cubes clinking against the crystal. "Miles, what's your startup capital?"

Miles threw back his drink, Adam's apple bobbing. "Five million. All my personal savings." His lips twisted wryly. "Grandpa's condition—turn it into five hundred million within three years to inherit the family business."

Dylan chimed in, "We've got the company structure set. Just need stable clients now."

"You launched without securing clients first?" Gavin's eyebrow arched, his gaze flickering between Ethan and Jenna.

Miles shrugged. "Isn't trial and error how business works?"

Gavin lowered his voice. "Ethan's the project director at HM Group. Win him over, and your order book will overflow."

Both Miles and Dylan choked on their drinks. They exchanged glances—everyone knew Ethan was HM Group's heir apparent.

Jenna poured the aerated wine into crystal goblets, light refracting through the glass. Her silver bracelet shimmered as she served each guest. "Enjoy." She took a sip before exiting, her skirt swirling elegantly.

The moment the door closed, Miles leaned in. "Gavin, Ethan is clearly—"

Gavin pressed a finger to his lips. "Remember, to Ms. Roland, he's just a regular project director." His meaningful glance at Ethan said everything. "Address him as Mr. Roscente."

Understanding dawned on Miles—the heir was roleplaying. He smoothly pivoted. "Mr. Roscente, I heard HM has a new project..."

Ethan's fingers drummed the table, but his gaze lingered where Jenna had disappeared. Under the chandelier's glow, his lips curved in an enigmatic half-smile.
###Chapter 62

The private room was dimly lit, with crystal chandeliers casting hazy reflections.

Ethan Roscente's slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the table, his gaze deep as a still pond.

Miles Valentine nervously rubbed his palms together, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"Mr. Roscente, about my new company..."

Ethan raised a hand to silence him, taking a measured sip from his wineglass.

"International trade?"

Miles nodded eagerly. "Yes, mainly clothing and footwear imports."

Ethan traced the rim of his glass, producing a clear, ringing sound.

"Logistics secured?"

Miles stiffened. "Maritime shipping is settled, but land and air transport..."

Dylan Lawrence offered a cigar, which Ethan declined with a subtle wave.

"Price too low?"

Miles forced an awkward smile. "They claim the margins are too thin."

Ethan's attention suddenly shifted to the doorway, his eyes narrowing.

Gavin Valentine was peering inside hesitantly.

"Where's Tristan?"

Gavin scratched his head. "In the next room discussing business."

Ethan's expression turned glacial.

"Get him here."

Miles interjected cautiously, "Mr. Roscente, about our potential partnership..."

Ethan leaned forward abruptly, his black dress shirt accentuating his muscular frame.

"Know why no one wants to work with you?"

Miles held his breath.

"Please enlighten me."

Ethan tapped the table like a ticking countdown.

"No credibility. No connections. No collateral."

Each word drained more color from Miles' face.

Dylan suddenly spoke up. "Sir, Miss Roland just called—"

Ethan's gaze sharpened like a blade.

Miles caught the reaction instantly.

"Miss Roland is...?"

A single icy glance from Ethan silenced him.

Gavin returned with Tristan Ashcroft in tow.

Tristan entered impeccably dressed, all polished smiles.

"Mr. Roscente, long time no see."

Ethan gestured for him to sit, then addressed Miles without turning.

"Bring your proposal to my office tomorrow."

Miles' eyes widened in disbelief.

"Thank you, sir!"

But Ethan had already turned to Tristan, his voice dropping.

"That Southeast Asia shipment..."

Taking the hint, Miles rose to leave.

At the door, he caught Ethan's cold parting words:

"Tell Jenna I won't be home tonight."

Miles paused mid-step, curiosity flickering in his eyes.

Just who was this mysterious Miss Roland to Ethan Roscente?
###Chapter 63

Gavin Valentine pushed open the door of VIP Room 999. Tristan Ashcroft had been waiting inside for quite some time.

"Mr. Roscente." Tristan stood up respectfully, raising his glass in two consecutive toasts. "You asked to see me?"

Ethan Roscente slid a cigarette from his case and offered it to him.

"Thank you, Mr. Roscente." Tristan accepted it hastily, pulling out his lighter to light Ethan's cigarette first before his own.

Amid the swirling smoke, Ethan's piercing gaze fixed on Tristan. "Why is Jenna Roland's brother here?"

Tristan's heart skipped a beat.

He'd anticipated this question, but not the bluntness.

Jenna's importance to Ethan was greater than he'd imagined.

"Here's what happened..." Tristan recounted Milo Roland's visit to the club in detail.

Gavin suddenly cut in, "Who told the kid his sister works here?"

Tristan shook his head. "He didn't say."

Then he remembered the incident with Jenna's cousin two nights prior.

Could it have been him?

Ethan immediately noticed Tristan's shift in expression. "Speak."

Tristan stiffened.

This man was terrifying—reading his thoughts before he even voiced them.

"Jenna's cousin caused a scene here the other night..." Tristan relayed the events.

"Damn it!" Gavin slammed the table. "What kind of monster slanders his own cousin?"

Miles Valentine smirked coldly. "If I ever run into that bastard..."

Tristan stole a glance at Ethan.

The man continued smoking in silence, but his eyes had turned glacial.

Tristan stubbed out his cigarette. "Milo was adamant about stopping his sister from working here. It took everything I had to calm him down. Those siblings have it rough—orphaned, with no reliable relatives, the kid still in school, and from what I hear, battling a serious illness..."

Ethan's fingers paused mid-drag.

So Jenna had approached Grandma Blanche for money?

A shadow flickered in his eyes.

If she dared exploit the old woman...

Studio 54 was packed that Friday night.

Jenna Roland didn't finish serving the last guests until 3 AM.

Her high alcohol tolerance was the only thing keeping her upright.

In the staff lounge, Milo lay curled asleep on the couch.

Jenna changed clothes quietly before gently shaking him awake.

"Sis..." Rubbing his eyes, Milo sat up hoarsely. "Done for the night?"

"Yeah. Let's go home."

She grabbed his phone, checked out with the manager, and the siblings vanished into the darkness.
###Chapter 64

The night deepened as Jenna Roland led her brother Milo out of the club's entrance.

A black Maybach idled by the curb. The tinted window rolled down, revealing Gavin Valentine's chiseled profile.

"Mr. Valentine?" Jenna halted mid-step.

Gavin adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "Mr. Roscente instructed me to drive you."

Her fingers tightened around her purse strap. "That's unnecessary. We were planning to grab dinner first."

"Get in." His tone brooked no argument. "I'll take you wherever you want."

After a brief hesitation, Jenna opened the door. Milo gaped at the luxurious interior, discreetly tugging his sister's sleeve.

Twenty minutes later, the car stopped outside a bustling street food stall.

"You can head back now, Mr. Valentine." Jenna forced politeness. "We'll call a cab—"

"Mr. Roscente's orders." Gavin cut her off. "I'll wait."

Inside the stall, raucous laughter and sizzling woks filled the air. Jenna's eyes sparkled as she placed their order.

"Guess how much we made tonight?" She leaned in conspiratorially.

Milo nibbled his chopsticks. "Five grand?"

"Higher."

"Eight?"

Jenna shook her head, holding up two fingers. "Fourteen thousand!"

"What?!" Milo nearly knocked over his soda.

Nearby diners turned to stare. He clapped a hand over his mouth.

"Landed some big clients today." Jenna whispered. "Mr. Roscente's table alone ordered two bottles of Louis XIII."

Milo's cheeks flushed with excitement. "Sis, you're a business prodigy!"

Suddenly, he grabbed her wrist. "What if... we used this money to start something small?"

Jenna's smile froze.
###Chapter 65

Working odd jobs wasn't a sustainable solution. With her limited education, climbing the social ladder through wages seemed impossible.

Gavin's words pierced Jenna's heart like a thorn. She knew this truth all too well. But right now, Milo's condition took priority.

"Let's focus on the surgery first," Jenna cut him off decisively. "We'll figure out the rest later."

Milo lowered his head, fingers nervously twisting his shirt hem. He hated being a burden yet couldn't help worrying about his sister.

"Sis, the club might be..." He bit his lip. "But the money's good. After my surgery, you could save up to open a small shop?"

Jenna remained silent, simply placing a piece of meat in his bowl. Her mind was already made up—once Milo recovered, she'd reclaim their family orchard.

When the waiter arrived with steaming fried noodles, Jenna suddenly remembered something. She hurried toward the parking lot.

The car window rolled down, revealing Gavin's sharply defined features in the dim light.

"Mr. Valentine, care to join us?"

"Pass." His refusal was curt.

Back at their table, Milo stared blankly at his phone. As Jenna sat down, she heard him murmur, "Why is Mr. Roscente being so kind to us?"

That was a question Jenna wanted answered too.

During the drive back, Gavin casually mentioned the incident with their cousin. Jenna's pulse quickened—she hadn't expected Tristan to share that detail.

"Next time just have someone beat him up," Gavin said as casually as discussing the weather. "Tristan knows how to handle the fallout."

Jenna gave a bitter smile. "Strike one and ten will retaliate. We can't afford to provoke that family."

Through the rearview mirror, she saw Gavin's eyebrow arch. "What's there to fear? Anything solvable with money isn't a real problem."

The remark drew a sudden laugh from Jenna, quickly stifled. Watching neon lights streak past the window, she asked softly, "Why are you helping us?"

"Ethan's friends are my friends." His answer came effortlessly.

Jenna pressed her lips together. She didn't believe a word of it.
###Chapter 66

Jenna Roland frowned slightly. When had she ever admitted to being Ethan Roscente's friend?

They were legally married with official certificates.

Though it was a marriage of convenience, the embossed seal on their marriage license was undeniably real.

She pressed her lips together but ultimately didn't correct Gavin Valentine.

Milo Roland gave Gavin a thoughtful glance. Apparently Ethan hadn't even told his closest friend about the marriage.

Gavin's car soon pulled into Beverly Hills.

"Thank you," Jenna murmured, taking her brother's hand as they exited the vehicle.

Walking through the neighborhood, Milo suddenly remarked, "That Gavin seems like a decent guy."

"Mmm." Jenna nodded.

When they reached home, light spilling from under the bedroom door made Jenna pause. Ethan had returned early.

She tiptoed to grab her pajamas before heading to the bathroom.

The next morning, Ethan left without disturbing the sleeping siblings.

At 9:30 AM, the alarm buzzed.

Jenna rubbed her eyes and sat up. She needed to be alert today—they were hosting the elderly couple.

Soon, the aroma of rice filled the kitchen. By 10:30, all prepared ingredients were neatly arranged on the cutting board.

The braised pork knuckle simmered in the clay pot as Jenna wiped her hands and dialed her phone.

"Grandma Blanche, have you and Grandpa Harrison left yet?"

A hearty laugh came through the receiver. "Already on our way, dear. Start cooking first."

After hanging up, Jenna immediately turned on the stove.

Using both burners doubled her efficiency. Just as two dishes were plated, the doorbell rang.

Milo raced to answer it.

Jenna hurried to the foyer and saw three figures standing there.

Beside Grandma Blanche stood a white-haired gentleman with keen eyes—undoubtedly Grandpa Harrison Roscente.

The last person made Jenna blink in surprise. Ethan had returned unusually early today.

"This is Grandpa Harrison," Grandma Blanche introduced warmly.

"Hello, Grandpa." Jenna gave a slight bow.

"Nice to meet you, Grandpa Harrison." Milo offered a proper bow.

The old man's eyes crinkled with delight. "Good, good children, both of you."

Jenna ushered the guests inside before turning to her brother. "Milo, please serve tea to our grandparents."

As rich aromas wafted from the kitchen, Jenna tied on her apron and hurried back to the stove.
###Chapter 67

Grandma Blanche took a sip of tea, her gaze drifting to the armchair in the corner.

Ethan Roscente had been sitting there since he arrived, silently scrolling through his phone with an icy aura that warned others to keep their distance.

She sighed and turned to Milo Roland beside Grandpa Harrison, her eyes softening. "What grade are you in now, dear?"

"Eleventh grade," Milo answered politely.

Grandpa Harrison's eyes lit up. "That means you'll be applying to colleges next year! Have you decided where to go?"

Milo's fingers twisted together unconsciously. He had already resolved to find a job after graduation to help ease his sister's burdens.

Grandma Blanche saw right through him. "Education is your golden ticket. Without a degree, life will be much harder."

"But..." Milo's voice dropped. "College is expensive..."

"Silly boy." She patted his hand. "Your sister's greatest wish is for you to succeed. Would you really disappoint her?"

Grandpa Harrison nodded. "She's right. A good education will help you protect those you care about."

Milo's eyes grew warm. These elders treated him like their own grandson, filling his heart with gratitude.

In stark contrast, Ethan remained as cold as a statue, his expression unreadable since his arrival.

The kitchen door suddenly swung open, revealing Jenna Roland. "Grandma, Grandpa, Mr. Roscente—dinner's ready."

"Coming!" Grandma Blanche immediately rose to help.

But Grandpa Harrison frowned. "Why does she call you 'Mr. Roscente'?"

Ethan didn't even glance up. "Let her call me what she wants."

The blunt reply left the old man speechless. Before he could react, Ethan had already stood and headed to the restroom.

The dining table was set with five dishes and a soup, all vibrant and appetizing. The braised pork knuckle glistened, its rich aroma filling the air.

Grandpa Harrison's eyes widened. "Did you cook all this, Jenna?"

"Please try it." She smiled, handing him chopsticks.

He eagerly picked up a piece of pork. "This is even better than our chef's—"

Before he could finish, Grandma Blanche stomped on his foot under the table.
###Chapter 68

Jenna and Milo's gazes simultaneously landed on Grandpa Harrison.

Jenna blinked. "Excuse me?"

Grandpa Harrison cleared his throat awkwardly. "It's more fragrant than Ethan's mother's cooking."

Grandma Blanche smiled and explained, "Ethan's mother's maiden name is Chu."

The room fell silent.

Ethan frowned, shooting the elderly couple an exasperated look.

Since when did his mother change her surname?

These two were getting increasingly ridiculous in their attempts to please Jenna.

Noticing Ethan's stare, Grandma Blanche glared back. "What are you looking at?"

Ethan silently averted his gaze.

Better not provoke her.

Jenna broke the awkward silence. "Grandpa, Grandma, why don't you taste it first?"

Grandma Blanche's expression instantly softened when she turned to Jenna—a stark contrast to how she'd just looked at Ethan.

The blatant favoritism made Ethan question his place in the family.

He might as well be adopted. Jenna was clearly the biological grandchild here.

"Of course." Grandma Blanche picked up her chopsticks, serving Jenna and Milo each a braised pork knuckle before adding cola chicken wings to their bowls.

Milo had been eyeing the chicken wings hungrily but restrained himself out of respect for the elders.

Now that the wings were in his bowl, he took an eager bite.

His sister's cola chicken wings were always perfection.

A sudden thought struck him—if he were really gone someday, he'd never taste this again.

To keep enjoying his sister's cooking, he had to survive. No matter what.

Grandpa Harrison shared Ethan's picky palate.

Even professional chefs rarely met his exacting standards at home.

Yet Jenna's cooking exceeded all expectations.

He shocked everyone by eating three bowls of rice at lunch—so much that he ended up patting his full stomach with satisfied burps.

"Jenna, who taught you to cook like this?" Grandpa Harrison asked warmly.

Jenna shook her head. "Self-taught. I started cooking at twelve, with occasional tips from my mom."

Grandpa Harrison's eyes shone with admiration. "You could open a restaurant with these skills. I'd be your most loyal customer."

Jenna smiled. "For you, Grandpa, it's always free."

Grandpa Harrison laughed heartily. "Now this is what I call a thoughtful granddaughter. Unlike some ungrateful people I know."
###Chapter 69

Grandpa Harrison set down his chopsticks with a meaningful glance at Ethan.

The unspoken tension thickened the air.

Ethan rose expressionlessly, adjusting his cuffs with slender fingers. "An urgent matter at the office."

Grandma Blanche slammed her chopsticks down, porcelain clinking sharply.

"This is your home, not a hotel!" She glared at him. "Jenna worked all morning, and you're just leaving?"

Jenna frantically waved her hands. "Grandma, I'll clean up—"

She stole a glance at Ethan's stormy expression, a cold sweat breaking down her spine. Offending him meant she and Milo would be homeless.

Grandpa Harrison sipped his tea leisurely. "Ethan, do the dishes."

The sudden clatter of plates echoed from the kitchen.

Jenna's eyes widened. Ethan was actually clearing the table!

Grandma Blanche winked triumphantly at Milo. "Let's give the newlyweds some privacy."

Flustered, Jenna hurried in to find Ethan stacking dishes by the sink.

"I'll wash them," she whispered.

He shook water droplets from his hands, his crisp pine scent enveloping her.

"Suit yourself."

As he turned, his shirt hem brushed her knuckles, sending shivers down her spine.

Watching his retreating figure, her heartbeat stuttered.

Water gushed from the faucet, suds foaming around her slender fingers.

Outside, Grandma Blanche's voice carried deliberately loud: "That's how you train a man!"
###Chapter 70

Jenna Roland pressed her lips together as she scrubbed the dishes.

The faucet ran loudly. When she finished cleaning the kitchen and returned to the living room, Ethan Roscente was already gone.

Grandma Blanche smiled and waved her over. "Ethan had to meet a client unexpectedly. Come rest for a while, dear."

"Okay." Jenna obediently sat beside the elderly woman.

Grandma Blanche took her hand. "Ethan may seem cold and distant, but he's warm-hearted underneath. Isn't that what you young people call 'cold on the outside, warm on the inside'?"

Jenna wanted to say Ethan avoided her like the plague, and there were still unresolved misunderstandings between them. But seeing the kindness in the old woman's eyes, she swallowed her words.

"I understand, Grandma," she replied softly.

Grandpa Harrison chimed in, "Don't spoil him. Make him pull his weight at home. A marriage takes two people working together."

Jenna nodded eagerly. "You're absolutely right, Grandpa."

The elderly couple exchanged knowing glances. They could tell she agreed readily now but would shoulder everything alone once they left. Too soft-hearted for her own good.

An hour later, after seeing them off, Jenna closed the door and exhaled deeply.

Milo Roland peeked out from his room. "Sis, go take a nap. I'll handle the grocery shopping."

Having stayed up late and woken early to cook, Jenna was exhausted. She didn't argue, transferring money to her brother before retreating to her room.

She slept like the dead, waking at four in the afternoon.

The living room was empty. After washing up and doing her makeup, she found Milo on the sofa.

"Where were you?" she asked, tying up her hair.

"Just got back from shopping." He stood and headed to the kitchen. "Hungry? Want me to make you some noodles?"

"Sure."

Following him into the kitchen, Jenna suddenly remembered something. "Wait, show me that text message."

Milo handed over his phone. When she opened the message from the unknown number, her face turned ashen.

"It's definitely Jason Roland!" she spat through gritted teeth. "That bastard!"

"Him?" Milo frowned, confusion flashing in his eyes.

Jenna's hands trembled with rage. "He called demanding forty grand from me. I never thought he'd send you something like this!"

Her chest heaved. When his extortion failed, Jason had exposed her club job to Milo—utterly despicable!

"I didn't expect it either." Milo's fists clenched audibly, his eyes filled with disgust. "That piece of trash."
###Chapter 71 

Jenna's knuckles turned white as she clenched her phone. Her uncle's family had crossed every line of decency, even daring to send threatening texts. This was clearly a warning—they intended to spread exaggerated rumors about her job at the club.

She recalled Milo's naive suggestion to apologize and move back in with them. The thought sent a chill down her spine now. If she'd actually returned, who knew what else they would've done to her.

"I recorded them that night," Jenna said coldly. "If they spread lies, I'll take the recording to the police."

Milo frowned as he stirred the noodles in the pot. "But they didn't succeed. Would the police even care?"

"At least it'll teach them a lesson." Her eyes sharpened. "I won't let them get away with this."

The water boiled, noodles swirling in the pot.

Jenna suddenly pulled five crisp hundred-dollar bills from her wallet and pressed them into Milo's hand.

"Sis?" He stared at the money. "This is too much."

"Buy yourself new clothes." She eyed his faded school uniform. "You're a sophomore now. You can't keep wearing old things."

He tried to refuse. "My uniform is enough—"

"Take it." She forced the money into his palm. "Before, I couldn't provide for you. Now that I can, I want you to have better."

Without waiting for another protest, she turned and left the kitchen.

The moment she sat on the couch, her phone rang. It was Stella, her coworker.

"Cover my shift," Stella said breathlessly. "My boyfriend got into a fight and got arrested. I have to bail him out."

Jenna sighed after hanging up. She'd met Stella's boyfriend before—a freeloader who lived off Stella's income. Last time his father was hospitalized, Stella even paid the medical bills.

"Sis, noodles are ready." Milo carried two bowls into the living room.

In Jenna's bowl, two golden fried eggs rested atop the steaming noodles.
###Chapter 72

Milo's bowl contained just a single fried egg.

"Why didn't you make two?" Jenna asked from the dining table.

Milo stirred his noodles without looking up. "Haven't had much appetite lately."

Jenna frowned. There were still two cartons of eggs in the fridge.

She didn't press further and began eating her noodles.

Halfway through the meal, Milo suddenly raised his head. "Sis, are you really going to stay married to Ethan?"

That man always wore an icy expression, his gaze perpetually distant.

Jenna set down her chopsticks, a faint smile touching her lips. "Yes."

They'd only registered their marriage to claim her parents' orchard.

She never expected her uncle's family would be shameless enough to refuse returning it.

Later, Grandma Blanche arranged for her to live with Ethan.

Homeless, she had no choice but to move in with her brother.

Since they were living under his roof, she wouldn't be ungrateful.

If Ethan wanted a divorce, she'd sign the papers anytime.

But as long as they remained married, she'd fulfill her duties as his wife.

"But his personality..." Milo trailed off.

Jenna chuckled. "He doesn't abuse me or cheat. He even provides for us."

"That's already better than men who drink and gamble."

"Isn't stability what marriage is about?"

Milo clenched his fists. "Sis, I swear I'll give you a better life someday."

"Then you'd better get into a top university first." She ruffled his hair.

"With companies like HM Group, a six-figure salary isn't just a dream."

Milo had always ranked at the top of his class.

If he kept it up, his future would be limitless.

"I will." The teenager's eyes burned with determination.

Jenna smiled warmly.

After breakfast, she grabbed her bag and left for work.

......

Her e-bike stopped at a crosswalk.

As the light turned red, a black Rolls-Royce pulled up beside her.

Jenna couldn't help stealing a glance.

That car cost more than she'd earn in a lifetime.

Better stop dreaming. Being reborn as a trust fund baby would be more realistic.

Inside the car, Ethan reviewed documents.

His peripheral vision caught the familiar figure outside.

The tinted windows hid him from view.

When the light turned green, the e-bike zipped away.

Ethan's gaze followed her retreating figure.

Only when she disappeared around the corner did he lower his eyes again.
###Chapter 73

Jenna Roland had just stepped into Studio 54 when the receptionist called out to her.

"Patrick Klein wants you in the conference room immediately."

She frowned and strode toward the meeting room in her high heels.

The weekly morning meetings were always the same. Patrick stood by the projector, repeating the same tired performance targets and reminders.

Jenna sat in the corner, her fingers tapping lightly on the table.

When the meeting ended, she intercepted Patrick before he could leave.

"Stella Laurent is taking the night off. Her boyfriend had an emergency."

Patrick flipped through his files without looking up. "Noted."

Jenna turned and headed to the locker room, changing into the club's standard uniform.

She pushed open the lounge door and walked straight to the sofa in the farthest corner.

She had barely sat down when Sophia Merouin walked in.

Sophia's gaze lingered on Jenna for a few seconds before she took a seat beside her.

The glow of her phone screen illuminated Sophia's face as she suddenly spoke. "Heard you made 140K last night?"

Jenna kept scrolling on her phone without glancing up. "Yeah."

Sophia's nails dug into the sofa, leaving a faint mark.

"Impressive," she said, her voice dripping with envy.

Jenna finally looked up, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "Thanks for the compliment."

Sophia's expression darkened instantly.

"Stop acting all high and mighty. All you did was drink with a few old men."

Jenna snapped her phone shut and stood.

"I'm here to work, not argue with you."

As she turned to leave, Sophia's curse followed her. "Bitch!"

Jenna whirled around, her gaze sharp. "Say that again?"

Sophia crossed her legs and smirked. "Did I say anything? Must be your imagination."
###Chapter 74

Jenna Roland walked toward Sophia Merouin in her stilettos, her gaze sharp as a blade. "Having hearing problems? Seems you're the one who needs a medical checkup."

A realization struck her.

Compromise only emboldened bullies.

Just like those years at her uncle's house—her silence had invited nothing but harsher abuse and exploitation.

Sophia's face twisted in fury.

She shot up from her seat, eyes blazing. "Say that again, I dare you."

Jenna smirked coldly. "If your ears don't work, that's not my problem."

Sophia had always thrown her weight around at Studio 54, relying on seniority and her connection to Tristan Ashcroft.

No one had ever challenged her to her face.

Her hand flew up, aiming to slap Jenna.

Jenna caught her wrist in a vice-like grip, making Sophia wince in pain.

When Sophia raised her other hand, Jenna seized that too.

Years of farm labor at her uncle's had honed her strength—now it served her well.

"You bitch! Let go!" Sophia shrieked.

Jenna's laugh was icy. "So you can come at me again? Not happening."

She shoved Sophia onto the couch.

"Jenna Roland! You'll regret this!" Sophia trembled with rage.

Jenna looked down at her. "Heard you have a crush on the boss? Push me, and I'll seduce him myself."

Sophia's pupils constricted. "You wouldn't dare!"

Jenna's eyes turned dangerous. "Tony Lombardi's my brother now. Touch me and see what happens."

Sophia paled instantly.

Tony's reputation at the club was untouchable.

Jenna suddenly beamed, sweet as honey. "Did I scare you? My bad."

As she turned to leave, she noticed a crowd of coworkers gathered at the doorway, watching the drama unfold.
###Chapter 75

Jenna Roland pushed the door open, and Chloe Blanchet immediately stepped aside.

Colleagues scattered to both sides, their eyes wide with shock.

That was Sophia Merouin—notoriously difficult to deal with, not to mention her special relationship with Tristan Ashcroft. How dare Jenna confront her directly?

Everyone had assumed Jenna was a pushover. No one expected such steel beneath her calm exterior.

Sophia burned with rage at the audience. She stormed to the doorway and snapped, "What are you staring at? Get lost!"

Chloe and the others didn't dare linger, quickly dispersing.

"Jenna, you're amazing!" Chloe whispered, giving her a thumbs-up. "Standing up to Sophia? I'm impressed."

Jenna crossed her arms, her gaze icy. "She started it."

She'd been sitting quietly when Sophia decided to pick a fight.

Did they really think she'd take it lying down?

"I know it was self-defense, but she'll hold a grudge," Chloe warned in a hushed tone. "She'll come after you."

Jenna settled into Booth One, her red lips curving slightly. "If I wasn't afraid to do it, I'm not afraid of the consequences."

"What if she brings backup?"

"She won't get the chance."

Chloe sank into the couch, frowning. "You shouldn't have made an enemy of her here at the club."

"Should I have just swallowed the insult?" Jenna crossed her legs. "That would only encourage her."

A realization dawned on Chloe.

Nice people get trampled.

"Just be careful," Chloe advised. "If anything happens, go straight to the boss."

Jenna rubbed the bridge of her nose. "Didn't you say she has a special relationship with him?"

"Better than staying silent."

Patrick Klein approached. "Chloe, Booth 302."

"Got it." Chloe stood and left.

......

In the break room, Sophia stewed in her anger.

She shot to her feet, determined to complain to Tristan.

But after searching the entire club, there was no sign of him.
###Chapter 76

Jenna Roland learned from Patrick Klein that Tristan Ashcroft was making a call in VIP Room 888.

She hurried to the room and pushed open the door, confirming Tristan stood by the window.

He had just ended the call and was about to leave when Jenna entered. He sank back into the leather sofa.

Crossing his long legs casually, he smirked. "Looking for me, sweetheart?"

That endearment only surfaced when they were alone.

Hearing it, Jenna relaxed slightly.

She bit her lip and sat beside him, looping her arm through his. "Boss, someone bullied me..."

Tristan arched a brow.

In his experience, Jenna was hardly the type to tolerate mistreatment.

"Who dared?"

"Sophia Merouin." Jenna's eyes reddened. "I merely mentioned commissions, and she accused me of jealousy. Called me deaf..."

Tristan's eyes narrowed.

He knew both women too well.

Sophia was indeed domineering, but Jenna was no pushover either.

"Did she really start it?" He lit a cigarette, his gaze sharp through the smoke.

Jenna stiffened.

"You don't believe me?"

"I trust my own judgment." He exhaled a smoke ring. "This arrangement benefits us both, Jenna. Don't expect me to fight your battles."

Her face paled instantly.

She'd thought their relationship meant something more.

Tristan stubbed out his cigarette, his expression icy. "Remember this—no one touches Sophia."

Ethan Roscente had given explicit orders.

Under his protection, Sophia was untouchable.

Jenna trembled violently.

"You... you like her?"

Her nails dug into her palms as she stared at Tristan, unblinking.
###Chapter 77

Jenna Roland was the brightest jewel at Studio 54.

Her tall, curvaceous figure and captivating peach-blossom eyes drew every gaze. Even her voice carried a seductive lilt. The most difficult clients melted under her charm.

Tristan Ashcroft's eyes followed her unconsciously.

Sophia Merouin clenched her glass until her knuckles turned white. After three years by his side, she'd never seen him look at anyone like that.

"Tristan." She forced a smile, leaning close to his ear. "My place tonight?"

He pushed her away, his gaze icy. "I said not to cross the line."

Her smile froze.

"Stay out of Jenna's business." His quiet voice cut like a blade. "Or you know what happens."

Sophia trembled. She'd never seen this side of him.

"What am I to you?" Her voice broke. "Three years, and this is how you treat me?"

Tristan scoffed. "This was never about feelings." He stood, looking down at her. "Know your place."

She bit her lip until she tasted blood.

Watching him walk away, her tears finally fell.

"Jenna..." She wiped her face, eyes turning venomous. "If you play dirty, don't blame me for what comes next."

Jenna pushed open the VIP room door and collided with a solid chest.

Tristan leaned against the wall, a cigarette between his fingers, his sharp features blurred by smoke.

"Boss?" Her pulse jumped.

He stubbed out the cigarette and tilted his chin. "Done for the night?"

"Just grabbing more drinks."

"Go ahead." His dark gaze held hers. "I'll wait."

Jenna hurried downstairs. Something felt off—had Sophia said something?

Distracted, she delivered the drinks and endured a few forced toasts before escaping.

When she returned, Tristan hadn't moved.
###Chapter 78

Jenna Roland stood at the office door, nervously twisting the hem of her blouse. "Boss, you wanted to see me?"

Tristan Ashcroft continued organizing files without looking up. "Follow me."

Her heart clenched as she hesitantly trailed behind him.

At the end of the hallway was an unused private room. Tristan pushed the door open, with Jenna close behind.

Sophia Merouin witnessed the scene.

Her serving tray clattered to the floor. Legs suddenly heavy as lead, she stood frozen.

The private room door slowly closed, cutting off her view.

Sophia bit her lower lip until it hurt. Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

They were meeting alone.

After just fighting with her, he went straight to Jenna.

So Tristan had already changed his heart.

Tears welled up. She spun around and stormed into the restroom, slamming the door.

Inside the private room.

Jenna stood by the coffee table, fingers nervously tracing the rim of a teacup. "Boss, is this about Sophia?"

Tristan lounged on the leather sofa, long fingers tapping the armrest. "Has she been giving you trouble?"

Jenna stared at the intricate carpet pattern.

Here comes the interrogation.

"Did she... tell you I bullied her?"

"Hmm." Tristan's voice remained neutral. "Said you deliberately made things difficult for her."

Jenna's head snapped up. "Are you firing me?"

Tristan suddenly laughed.

The deep chuckle echoed in the enclosed space.

Jenna blinked in confusion.

"First," he raised his index finger, "Sophia and I have no personal relationship."

"Second," his middle finger joined the first, "I never take sides without evidence."

Jenna's tense shoulders relaxed.

"I thought..."

"That I'd protect her?" Tristan stood, adjusting his suit cuff. "You're my top sales performer."

Pausing at the door, he added, "Next time she bothers you, come straight to me."

Jenna nodded obediently.

After Tristan left, she couldn't suppress a smile.

Sophia's days of privilege were over.

From now on, she wouldn't take any more abuse.
###Chapter 79

At six in the morning, Milo Roland tiptoed out of bed.

The aroma of spicy oil noodles filled the kitchen. He'd woken up early to prepare two bowls.

When Ethan Roscente emerged from his room, Milo's eyes lit up. "Mr. Roscente, I made spicy oil noodles. Would you like some?"

The man gave him a cold glance without breaking stride. "No."

Milo clenched the edge of his apron.

Last time, Ethan had finished every bite of the plain noodle soup...

At the dining table, the boy slurped his noodles quietly, growing more dejected with each bite.

He'd used extra chili this time and even fried scallion oil specially.

After devouring both portions himself, Milo was clearing the dishes when he heard movement from the master bedroom.

He gently closed the door, slung his backpack over his shoulder, and left.

Three familiar figures at the school gates froze the blood in his veins.

Fiona Roland's mink coat gleamed greasily in the morning light. Jason Roland argued with security, cigarette dangling from his lips. Heidi Roland's shrill voice pierced through the crowd: "My brother-in-law attends this school!"

Milo spun around and ran.

"Stop!"

"Don't you dare run, Milo!"

As footsteps closed in, he ducked into a breakfast stall at the alley entrance, knocking over two bamboo steamers of buns.

When the steaming trays hit the ground, Heidi's scream followed: "My new dress!"

After zigzagging through three alleys, Milo bent over, hands on knees, gasping for air.

The withered weeds by the school wall rustled as he crouched to part them.

The dog hole Ryan Watson had jokingly called the "Hogwarts passage" now glimmered with hope.
###Chapter 80

Milo Roland squeezed through the broken gap in the school's back wall, arriving at Class 3 of Grade 11 completely out of breath. The bell had already rung long ago.

He stood at the classroom door and called out, "Reporting in." The homeroom teacher glanced at him and waved him inside without comment.

Ryan Watson was dozing at his desk but jerked awake at the noise. He spotted beads of sweat still clinging to Milo's forehead.

"You're actually late?" Ryan whispered, disbelief written all over his face.

Milo shoved his backpack under the desk and pulled out his textbook. "Got cornered by two rabid dogs at the school gate."

"Dogs?" Ryan's eyes widened. "Since when are there dogs near campus?"

"No idea where they came from." Milo flipped open his book, fingers trembling slightly.

Ryan picked up on the unease. "Why were they chasing you?"

"Maybe..." Milo hesitated. "They wanted something I had."

The morning's close call flashed through his mind. Jason Roland had been lying in wait at the school entrance with Heidi and Victor, like starving wolves. If he hadn't been quick enough to slip through the wall, they'd have caught him for sure.

That family was like a bad penny. After failing to extort his sister, they'd now set their sights on him.

When the dismissal bell rang, Milo grabbed Ryan before he could bolt for the cafeteria. "We're eating out today."

They'd barely stepped off school grounds when three figures darted from an alleyway, blocking their path.

"Milo!" Jason advanced with a nasty grin. "Nowhere to run this time!"

Ryan instantly moved in front. "Who the hell are you?"

Heidi shrieked, "None of your damn business! Get lost!"

"Who you calling a hag, you old witch?" Ryan pulled out his phone. "Want me to call the cops right now?"

Milo spoke coldly. "Perfect timing. My sister has voice recordings of you as evidence."

Jason's expression faltered. He quickly pasted on a smile. "Milo, we just came to take you home. Family shouldn't hold grudges overnight."

Ryan finally understood—these were the parasitic relatives Milo always complained about.

"Cut the fake concern." Ryan snorted. "Get lost or I'm dialing 911!"

The three exchanged uneasy glances before retreating across the street. But their greedy eyes remained fixed on the boys.
###Chapter 81

Heidi and Fiona turned to stare at Jason in unison.

Confusion was written across their faces.

They had agreed to threaten Milo into forcing Jenna to pay up—or else they'd expose her job at the club.

Why the sudden change of plan?

Jason shot them a meaningful look.

Neither woman understood, but they held their tongues.

Milo's lips curled into a mocking smirk. "We have our own place now. We don't need your charity. Save your breath."

Fiona blinked rapidly. "Where could you possibly stay? Don't lie to me. We'll treat you better from now on."

The Roland relatives had always despised these siblings.

Where could they go?

Especially with Milo's congenital heart disease requiring expensive surgery. Would Jenna really splurge on rent?

The three adults exchanged puzzled glances.

Jason forced a smile. "Milo, we were wrong before. But family is family. Come home with us?"

Jenna earned good money at the club.

If they moved back in, free meals and housing were guaranteed.

Plus they could dump all household chores on Jenna.

A foolproof scheme.

Milo rolled his eyes. "In your dreams. Ryan, let's go."

Jason moved to block them.

Ryan pulled out his phone. "One more step and I'm calling the cops."

The school gates were crowded with witnesses.

Jason had no choice but to back off, plastering on a smile. "Our door is always open."

"Piss off!"

Milo shot him a disgusted glare before striding away with Ryan.

A vicious glint flashed in Jason's eyes as he returned to the car.

Heidi scowled. "We agreed to play hardball! That brat only responds to threats!"

Fiona fumed. "This was foolproof! We could've squeezed money out of Jenna!"

The wasted trip infuriated her.

Jason's face darkened. "What if they called the police? What if the kid recorded us too?"

A few thousand bucks wasn't worth jail time.
###Chapter 82

"Look at you, pathetic coward!" Heidi Roland planted her hands on her hips, her face twisted in disdain. "Too scared to even show your face at school?"

The word "coward" made Jason Roland flush crimson with humiliation.

Fiona Roland jabbed his forehead hard. "How did I give birth to such a useless waste of space?"

"..."

Was it wrong to value his own life?

Did they want him arrested for extortion before they'd be satisfied?

"If you're so capable, go extort Milo yourselves!" Jason retorted, his neck stiff with defiance. "Don't drag me into this!"

Fiona spat on the ground. "Watch me handle that little brat personally. You think I can't squeeze money out of him?"

...

At 5:30 p.m., Milo Roland and Ryan Watson crouched near a street food stall outside campus.

Steam rose from the simmering broth as Milo bit into a fish ball and checked his watch.

Evening study hall started at seven. He still had time.

"Let's hit the field." Milo patted Ryan's shoulder and pulled out his phone to call Jenna Roland.

His sister should be just waking up now.

"Hey, eaten yet?"

The clatter of a spatula came through the receiver. "Making noodles. What's up?"

Milo lowered his voice. "Aunt Fiona ambushed me twice at school today."

Jenna froze mid-eyebrow stroke.

Her pencil snapped in half.

"What did they say?"

"Tried to make me move back in." Milo kicked a pebble. "Didn't mention money, but something feels off."

Jenna's laugh was ice-cold. "Call the cops next time." She yanked open a drawer and pulled out a voice recorder. "I've got evidence."

"Got it!"

"Lock your door tonight."

After hanging up, Jenna stared at her razor-sharp reflection and slammed the makeup case shut.

Her e-bike screeched to a halt outside an electronics store.

"Got any discreet voice recorders?"

The clerk flinched at her intensity before presenting the latest model. "This one lasts 48 hours—"

Jenna scanned the payment QR code without hesitation.

For scum like them, only ironclad proof would do.

The e-bike roared toward the bar district through the gathering darkness.
###Chapter 83

Jenna Roland strode into Studio 54 in her stilettos, the click of her heels echoing through the lobby.

Stella Laurent pulled her aside the moment the staff meeting ended, her voice hushed with urgency.

"Did you really have a falling out with Sophia last night?" Stella whispered.

Jenna arched a brow and settled onto the leather sofa. "News travels fast."

"Chloe told me first thing this morning." Stella sat beside her, wringing her hands. "Sophia's ruthless. Why provoke her?"

Jenna leaned back, a cold smile playing on her red lips. "With people like her, you fight fire with fire. The more you yield, the bolder they become."

Stella's fingers twisted nervously. "Remember when she smashed that bottle over someone's head? What if she sends people after you—"

"Relax." Jenna patted her shoulder. "I know what I'm doing."

Stella exhaled sharply. "I should've made you take taekwondo classes..."

Jenna burst into laughter, her almond eyes crinkling like crescent moons, radiant as blooming jasmine.

"Enough about me." She deftly changed the subject. "Did you sort things out with your boyfriend?"

Stella bristled instantly. "Cost me over ten grand! That good-for-nothing!"

Jenna whistled. "That much?"

"Compensation, dinners, greasing palms..." Stella gritted her teeth. "I warned him—next time, we're through."

Jenna shook her head inwardly. Stella could do so much better. Why cling to such deadweight?

The club doors swung open.

Jenna's gaze sharpened as she rose to her feet. Stella followed suit.

"Mr. Roscente. Mr. Valentine." Jenna gave a slight nod.

Gavin Valentine approached with an easy smile. "Just drinks tonight. No business talk."

Patrick Klein scurried over, ushering them toward the VIP lounge with obsequious smiles. His eyes darted nervously toward Ethan Roscente—the younger Roscente heir's aura alone was enough to make anyone's blood run cold.

Jenna stayed put.

Out of the corner of her eye, she caught Sophia Merouin watching her from across the room, eyes glinting with malice.

Tonight wouldn't end peacefully.
###Chapter 84

Stella leaned close to Jenna's ear, whispering with a playful grin, "How many times is this now? Mr. Valentine and his friends always request you. Your commission tonight must be huge again. Aren't you going to treat me after making so much?"

Jenna settled back onto the couch, her fingers lightly tapping the armrest. "What do you want?"

"Anything's fine." Stella batted her lashes. "But something fancy would be even better."

"This weekend." Jenna's lips curved slightly. "I'll take you to that new French place."

Stella's eyes widened. "Seriously? The Michelin-starred one?"

Jenna nodded. "Consider it thanks for getting me this job. My brother just finished his exams, so I'll bring him too."

"Deal!" Stella clapped excitedly. "I'm holding you to that."

Patrick hurried over. "Jenna, VIP Room 888 is asking for you."

Jenna stood, deliberately raising her voice. "But Sophia's clients arrived first. They haven't been assigned yet."

Patrick frowned, glancing at Sophia nearby. "Mr. Valentine specifically requested you. Order doesn't matter here. Go now."

"Understood."

As Jenna turned toward the elevator, Sophia's shrill voice cut through the lounge. "Patrick, why does Jenna always get these clients? Are you playing favorites?"

The entire break room fell silent, all eyes turning toward them.

Patrick's face darkened. "Sophia! This is the client's explicit request. Take it up with Mr. Valentine if you have complaints!"

Sophia gaped, then muttered resentfully, "You could at least recommend the rest of us. Jenna's already making enough."

Patrick nearly laughed at the absurdity. "Clients choose who serves them. That's the rule."

He walked away, leaving Sophia fuming.

Stella rolled her eyes, whispering, "Some people just can't stand others succeeding."

......

Jenna entered VIP Room 888 with a tray of drinks, expertly uncorking a bottle.

The attendant quickly exited after delivering desserts.

Tonight, only Gavin and Ethan occupied the unusually quiet room.

Just as Jenna began pouring, Gavin's phone rang abruptly.
###Chapter 85

Gavin Valentine hung up the phone and turned to Jenna Roland. "Prepare two more glasses. My friends are arriving soon."

Jenna blinked in surprise. She had assumed it would be just the two of them tonight.

"Of course," she murmured, refilling two glasses.

Gavin swirled his drink. "Since you're free, why not join us for a few rounds?"

Jenna instinctively glanced at Ethan Roscente. The man remained silent, his aloof demeanor making her hesitate.

Gavin followed her gaze. "Ethan, you don't mind if she drinks with us, do you?"

"Your call." Ethan didn't look up from his phone, his icy presence creating an invisible barrier.

Jenna poured herself a drink and raised her glass to Gavin with a polite smile. "Mr. Valentine, thank you for your continued patronage. This one's for you."

Gavin lifted his glass cheerfully. "The service here is excellent. Though your presence certainly makes it better."

Her pulse quickened.

Gavin clinked his glass against Ethan's. "Come on, let's toast."

Ethan drank in silence, his cold indifference as natural as breathing.

Jenna felt relieved. Their marriage was merely transactional. His detachment meant nothing to her.

She toasted Gavin again before turning to Ethan. He took a perfunctory sip, refusing to meet her eyes.

Finishing her drink awkwardly, Jenna stood. "Please enjoy your evening. I'll take my leave—"

The private room door swung open.

Three men entered. Gavin rose to greet them. "Benjamin Durant, Jack Cardenas, and my brother Calvin Valentine." He gestured to Jenna. "This is Jenna Roland, our beverage specialist. Show her some courtesy."

After exchanging pleasantries, the group settled in. Jenna wanted to excuse herself but couldn't refuse hospitality duties.

She refilled her glass. "A toast to everyone. May you have a wonderful time."

Benjamin and the others raised their glasses. Jenna set hers down. "I won't intrude further—"

Jack's gaze lingered on her. "Leaving so soon, Miss Roland? Have we offended you?"

She paused. It would be impolite to leave right after their arrival.

Turning back with a practiced smile, she said, "Then allow me to stay for two more rounds."
###Chapter 86

Gavin Valentine swirled his wine glass, glancing at Jack Cardenas and the other two. "Do you know Jenna's drinking capacity? If she stays, the three of you combined wouldn't stand a chance."

Benjamin Durant's eyes widened. "Seriously?"

Gavin smirked. "Have you forgotten where she works? She wouldn't last a day without skills."

Jenna Roland picked up her glass and raised it toward Benjamin. "Mr. Durant, this one's for you."

"Cheers!" Benjamin downed it in one go.

She refilled her glass and turned to Calvin Valentine. "Mr. Valentine, my respects."

Calvin gave a slight nod before emptying his glass.

Finally, she faced Jack. "Mr. Cardenas, this is for you."

Jack narrowed his eyes. "Miss Roland, I don't like drinking while standing. Why don't you sit beside me?"

Jenna had noticed Jack's lecherous gaze the moment he entered. His shameless appraisal made her skin crawl.

Suppressing her disgust, professionalism forced her to take a seat beside him.

No one noticed Ethan Roscente's expression darkening like storm clouds. He sat motionless, radiating icy hostility.

"May I drink now?" Jenna asked, lifting her glass.

Jack grinned in satisfaction and drained his drink.

As Jenna moved to stand, her wrist was suddenly seized. She frowned at the greasy hand gripping her. "What's the meaning of this, Mr. Cardenas?"

"What's the hurry?" Jack's tone turned suggestive. "Shouldn't the entertainment wait for the guest's permission before leaving?"

Gavin's face twisted in anger. "What nonsense! She's not some escort!" His eyes darted to Ethan, whose expression had turned thunderous.

Jack scoffed. "Isn't she just a liquor promoter? Why the act?" He leaned closer to Jenna. "Name your price for tonight."

Jenna wrenched her hand free, her voice glacial. "Mr. Cardenas, control yourself."

Her peripheral vision caught Ethan—still silent, still detached, as if this scene meant nothing to him.

The promises exchanged during their marriage license signing echoed in her ears. Yet now, he simply watched.
###Chapter 87

A bitter ache welled up in Jenna's chest.

The truth was crystal clear now—in Ethan's eyes, she was no different from those escort girls.

Just as Jenna was about to speak, Gavin stood up abruptly.

His eyes burned with fury as he glared at Jack. "Jack, I don't care how you play around outside, but tonight is my gathering. If you harass Jenna again, get the hell out right now."

Jack turned to Gavin with a mocking smirk. "Gavin, why so protective? Got a thing for her? Fine, if you like her, I'll back off."

Jack's family ran a small business, nothing compared to the Valentines or the Durants.

With his petty wealth, he acted like a big shot, always making passes at pretty women.

Gavin usually ignored his antics.

But tonight, this fool had crossed the line by targeting someone under Ethan's protection.

What infuriated Gavin even more was Jack's audacity to suggest Jenna provide escort services?

Was he asking for death?

What surprised Gavin most was Ethan's silence throughout the ordeal.

Jenna was his friend. Shouldn't he have stepped in when she was being harassed?

Since Ethan wouldn't act, Gavin had to intervene.

He feared Ethan might hold him accountable later.

"Jenna, you should leave," Gavin said firmly.

"Okay." Jenna nodded, casting one last glance at Ethan before walking away.

This time, Jack didn't stop her.

After Jenna left, Calvin spoke up. "Bro, it's not like he wasn't going to pay her. Why make a big deal out of it?"

Brian chimed in, "You're not actually falling for her, are you?"

Gavin's face darkened with rage.

"Enough!" he snapped. "Jenna is off-limits. Show her respect from now on. If any of you dare lay a finger on her, don't blame me for what happens next."

Jack clicked his tongue. "Just admit you like her. Say the word, and I'll back off."

Gavin's voice turned icy. "I stopped you because your behavior disgusts me, not because of any feelings."

Jack scoffed. "What's the problem? If she's an escort, paying for her services is fair game. It's all consensual. We're here to have fun. Is she really worth ruining our friendship over?"

"That kind of woman"?

So Jack truly believed Jenna was an escort.

Ethan, who had remained silent, lit a cigarette and pulled out his phone.

"I don't see why Cardenas Enterprises needs to stay in business," he said calmly into the phone. "You have one hour. I want news of their bankruptcy."

Jack's face drained of color as he stared at Ethan in disbelief.
###Chapter 88

The moment the call ended, Ethan Roscente's eyes turned ice-cold.

He slowly lifted his gaze, his piercing stare cutting through Jack Cardenas like a blade.

Jack's back broke out in a cold sweat, his shirt instantly drenched.

"Mr. Roscente, how have I offended you?" Jack's voice trembled. "I sincerely apologize."

He racked his brain but couldn't fathom what he'd done to provoke the wrath of this business titan.

If his parents found out he'd single-handedly destroyed the family company, he'd never set foot in the Cardenas estate again.

Gavin Valentine understood perfectly.

Only one woman could make Ethan react like this—Jenna Roland.

He'd expected Ethan to suppress his anger, not obliterate the Cardenas empire outright.

This proved exactly how much Jenna meant to him.

Ethan exhaled a slow stream of smoke, dark currents swirling in his eyes.

"Get out." His voice was glacial. "Don't let me see you again."

Jack staggered as if struck by lightning, collapsing to his knees.

"Mr. Roscente! Please show mercy!" His voice cracked with desperation. "I'll do anything!"

Ethan's expression grew even more sinister.

"You're not worthy."

Gavin snorted and settled back into his chair.

"Reap what you sow." He crossed his legs. "Leave before he really loses his temper."

Jack's face turned ashen.

Benjamin Durant and Calvin Valentine exchanged uneasy glances, not daring to breathe too loudly.

They hurried after the shell-shocked Jack, grabbing his arms outside the club.

"What the hell did you do to piss him off?" Benjamin hissed.

Jack shook his head blankly.

If he knew the reason, he wouldn't be in this nightmare.
###Chapter 89

Neon lights cast fragmented shadows across the rain-slicked streets as night enveloped the city. Jack Cardenas stood trembling by the curb, a cigarette dangling between unsteady fingers. It took several attempts before his lighter finally sparked to life.

He inhaled deeply, his voice quivering. "I've only met him a handful of times. He never even looked at me properly. How could I have offended him?"

Benjamin Durant frowned. "Then why is he targeting your family's company?"

Calvin Valentine stroked his chin. "Ethan Roscente never acts without reason. There's more to this."

Benjamin replayed the scene in the private room—Ethan's icy silence shattering only when Jack's hands had wandered too close to Jenna Roland.

"I've got it!" Benjamin slapped his knee. "It's that beverage promoter!"

Jack and Calvin gaped at him.

"Are you insane?" Jack's cigarette ash scattered like falling snow. "What connection could a club girl possibly have with Ethan Roscente?"

Calvin shook his head. "A man of his status, defending some random server?"

Benjamin's eyes narrowed. "She's strikingly beautiful. Maybe she's his type. You practically molested his woman right in front of him—of course he'd retaliate."

"Then why didn't he react at the time?" Calvin pressed.

"Since when does Ethan settle scores immediately?" Benjamin's laugh held no warmth. "He always collects debts in his own time."

Jack's cigarette slipped from numb fingers. His face turned ashen. "We're finished... completely finished..."

Benjamin sighed. "Should've kept your hands to yourself. Brace yourself—your company won't survive this."

A thought struck Calvin. "If Ethan really favors her, why is she still working there?"

"Who knows?" Benjamin shrugged. "Just be glad it wasn't you who touched her."

......

Tension hung thick in VIP Room 888.

Gavin Valentine counted his blessings that the disaster wasn't of his making. Ethan drained his whiskey in one swallow and crushed out his cigarette. "Screen your guests better next time."

"Understood." Gavin bobbed his head.

Ethan strode into the hallway just as Jenna rounded the corner, arms laden with liquor bottles.

"Leaving so soon, Mr. Roscente?" She stepped aside, a flicker of confusion in her eyes.

Ethan paused. His stormy gaze raked over her delicate features before he wordlessly brushed past her.

Gavin forced a chuckle. "Last-minute business. Store the bottles for next time."

"Of course." Jenna dipped her head. "We look forward to your return."

As their figures disappeared down the corridor, Jenna worried her lower lip between her teeth. Something about Ethan tonight felt... different.
###Chapter 90

Ethan Roscente stepped out of Studio 54 into the deep night. He dismissed his driver and walked straight toward Gavin Valentine's car.

Gavin leaned against the car door, cigarette in hand. Spotting Ethan, he quickly stubbed it out.

"Get in." Ethan opened the rear door.

Gavin scrambled into the driver's seat. After buckling up, he glanced back. "Where to?"

Rubbing his temples, Ethan replied in a low voice, "Beverly Hills."

Gavin's grip on the steering wheel faltered. Beverly Hills? Wasn't that Jenna Roland's neighborhood?

He stole a glance at Ethan through the rearview mirror. The man's sharp profile flickered under passing streetlights, eyes closed in apparent exhaustion.

As the car merged onto the main road, Gavin finally broke the silence. "You own property in Beverly Hills?"

"Hmm." Ethan didn't even open his eyes.

Gavin's mind raced. Why would Ethan choose some suburban condo over his penthouse in the city center? Unless...

Was this about Jenna?

A grin tugged at Gavin's lips. If his hunch was right, things were about to get interesting.

Thirty minutes later, they pulled up at the gated community.

Gavin jumped out first, grinning. "Mind if I come up for a drink?"

Ethan stopped walking. His gaze turned icy. "Business?"

"Just tea..." Gavin rubbed his hands together.

"Convenience store's to your right." Ethan strode through the gates without looking back.

Left standing alone, Gavin watched Ethan's retreating figure disappear around a corner before trudging back to his car.

"Cheapskate," he muttered, starting the engine.

When Ethan entered the apartment, Milo Roland was curled on the couch scrolling through his phone.

Spotting Ethan, Milo immediately stood. "Mr. Roscente."

The faint scent of alcohol hung in the air. Wisely, Milo asked no questions.

Ethan headed toward the bedroom but suddenly turned at the doorway. "Did you know your sister works at a nightclub?"

Milo froze. His phone nearly slipped from his fingers.
###Chapter 91

Milo Roland had just reached the sofa when Ethan Roscente's voice cut through the silence behind him.

His body stiffened mid-sit, frozen in place.

"Mr. Roscente, I tried to talk her out of it." Milo straightened, his voice tense. "But with our current situation... she has no choice but to keep working there."

No one wished for Jenna to leave that place more than he did.

Yet his illness was a bottomless pit, devouring piles of medical bills every single day.

Jenna was his only family. She refused to give up on him, no matter what.

"Money trouble?" Ethan's tone was glacial.

Milo's fingers twisted together unconsciously. "Congenital heart disease. The doctors say I need surgery."

Ethan stepped closer, his brow shadowed with frost.

"How much?"

"Over a million." Milo gave a bitter smile. "Our uncle took over the orchard our parents left us. We've been... living on borrowed grace."

He suddenly realized he'd said too much and quickly lowered his head. "Sorry. I shouldn't have—"

So that was how difficult her life had been.

Ethan's eyes darkened as he turned and walked into the bedroom.

He picked up his phone and dialed a number.

......

At 3:30 AM, Jenna dragged her exhausted body home.

When she opened the wardrobe, she froze.

The once-empty closet was now packed with clothes.

Jackets and dresses of every style hung neatly, with several pairs of brand-new shoes lined up below.

Her gaze instinctively shifted to the man sleeping on the bed.

Did he... buy all this?

But theirs was supposed to be a marriage of convenience. Why would he do this?

Her fingers brushed against the sleeve of a cashmere coat. The fabric was impossibly soft.

As the sound of running water filled the bathroom, Ethan opened his eyes.

He was a light sleeper, roused by the slightest noise.

Which was how he always knew the exact moment she returned each night.

When Jenna stepped out after her shower, she was stunned again by the array of skincare products on the vanity.

Each bottle bore elegant English labels, their packaging as refined as works of art.

She picked up a jar of cream and inhaled the delicate scent of roses.

The fragrance... inexplicably reminded her of Ethan's crisp, pine-like cologne.
###Chapter 92

The gift list from Ethan's banquet was longer than Jenna had imagined.

Luxury cosmetics lined the vanity in perfect rows.

High-end skincare products gleamed under the lights.

Jenna stared at Ethan sleeping soundly on the bed, her brow furrowed.

She couldn't comprehend why this man was being so attentive.

The wall clock ticked past 2 AM.

Yawning, Jenna decided to question him another day.

She twisted open her trusty jar of Dabao cream.

Then she remembered the voice recorder she'd prepared for Milo.

Tiptoeing to the living room, she found it placed conspicuously on the coffee table.

A neatly written sticky note sat beside it.

Back in the bedroom, sleep claimed her quickly.

But Ethan's eyes snapped open in the dark.

His gaze fell on Jenna curled up on the floor.

The expensive skincare set sat untouched on the vanity.

That cheap moisturizer stung his eyes.

A girl in her twenties should be enjoying life.

Yet Jenna had turned herself into a money-making machine.

She'd sacrifice anything for her brother's illness.

Ethan's expression darkened with conflicting emotions.

He'd met countless gold-digging women.

Jenna's devotion to family moved him.

But her sudden closeness to the Roscentes raised suspicions.

Grandma Blanche's favoritism made no sense.

A new label formed in Ethan's mind.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

He wouldn't be fooled by such a woman.

...

A shrill ringtone shattered the silence.

Jenna fumbled for her phone.

Milo's name flashed on the screen—during school hours.

"Jenna, it's bad."

Panic laced his voice.

Aunt Fiona had stormed into his classroom demanding money.

The voice recorder captured everything.

Police were already at the school.

They needed Jenna to testify immediately.

Adrenaline cleared the sleep from her mind.

She hadn't expected the recorder to be useful so soon.

Fiona's audacity knew no bounds—extorting a student in broad daylight.

"I'm on my way."

Jenna rushed through her morning routine.

No time for lipstick.

Her motorcycle roared to life downstairs.

Morning wind whipped against her cheeks.

Twenty minutes later.

She stood panting at the school gates.
###Chapter 93

Jenna Roland arrived at the school to find the campus buzzing with rumors.

She dialed Milo Roland's number. Her brother answered in a hushed voice, "Sis, I'm in Mr. Zhang's office."

Hanging up, Jenna hurried toward the academic building. A crowd of curious students had gathered outside the office, including Milo's classmate Ryan Watson.

Pushing open the door, Jenna immediately spotted Milo standing in the corner. The room held several teachers and four uniformed police officers. To her surprise, Jason Roland and Victor Roland were also present.

"Officer, I have evidence." Jenna pulled out her phone. "This is a recording of Jason threatening me a few days ago."

Jason's voice rang clear from the recording: "If you don't pay up, I'll expose your secrets."

Victor paled. "That recording must be fake! My son would never do such a thing!"

Fiona Roland suddenly dropped to her knees, wailing dramatically. "Officer, please see the truth! We raised these ungrateful siblings for years—"

"Enough!" Jenna cut her off sharply. "You've harassed my brother at school repeatedly. Now you're twisting the facts!"

Officer Liam Hill frowned at Milo. "They claim you owe them money?"

Milo clenched his fists. "I borrowed five hundred for textbooks at semester start. Now they demand twenty thousand. This is extortion!"

Fiona shrieked hysterically. "After all the food and shelter we provided, now you think you can just walk away?"

Tension crackled in the office. Jenna watched the mother-son duo's performance with icy detachment.

She should have known—some people never change.
###Chapter 94

Jenna Roland's fingers trembled with rage.

All these years, they'd accused her of not paying rent or living expenses?

Absurd!

She'd slaved away at Fiona Roland's house, even scrubbing the filthiest toilets. And now they dared to twist the truth in front of the police!

"The transaction records are all in my phone," Jenna sneered. "Shall I pull them up right now?"

She'd prepared for this.

Every transfer had been meticulously labeled "rent" or "living expenses," and she'd kept every chat log intact.

Fiona's face paled.

She hadn't expected Jenna to have proof.

"This constitutes extortion," Officer Liam Hill said sternly. "Let's continue this at the station."

Victor Roland opened his mouth to protest, but a sharp look from the officer silenced him.

The police car couldn't fit everyone.

Jenna followed behind on her e-bike with Milo Roland riding pillion.

On the way, she texted Ethan Roscente: "Can't make lunch today. Something came up."

He replied with a single word: "Fine."

That icy response.

Jenna stared at her phone.

Could this same man really have sent all those extravagant gifts?

At the station, Officer Hill gestured them toward the interrogation room.

Milo kept swallowing nervously.

"Officer, we're the victims here!" His voice shook.

The officer's stern expression softened slightly.

"Relax. This is just routine questioning."

Jenna sat upright in her chair.

She was ready to see what tricks Fiona would try to pull this time.
###Chapter 95

Officer Liam Hill frowned. Uncle? Did he really look that old?

He turned to Milo Roland, his tone laced with exasperation. "Do I look that old to you?"

Milo froze, fingers twisting together unconsciously. "No."

Liam spun his pen between his fingers. "Just call me Officer Hill."

At twenty-five, being called "uncle" stung more than he cared to admit.

Jenna Roland pulled out a chair, her gaze sweeping over the sterile walls. "Officer Hill, are we being interrogated?"

The interrogation room's chill crept down her spine.

Milo's breathing grew noticeably uneven.

Liam closed the file folder, his voice softening. "Just routine questions. Relax."

The siblings exhaled in unison.

Jenna pressed her lips together. "What do you want to know?"

He flipped open his notepad. "Describe your relationship with them."

Her fingertips tapped the table. "Fiona Roland is my aunt. Victor Roland is my uncle. Jason Roland is my cousin. Heidi Roland is his wife."

Her voice dropped. "Our parents died young. No relatives would take us in—except my uncle's family."

"We lived there five years. Paid every cent owed, did all the housework, even managed our parents' orchard for them."

She lifted her chin, eyes blazing. "They call me ungrateful, but they're the real villains. Officer Hill, you must punish this extortion attempt."

After jotting key details, Liam asked, "Did you transfer money during the recorded incident?"

"No." Jenna shook her head. "I recognized it as blackmail."

His pen stilled. "Without an actual transaction, it's only attempted extortion. The penalty would be lighter."

Disappointment flickered across her face. "What would happen?"

"A fine or short detention." He met her gaze. "Are you willing to settle?"

"Absolutely not!" Jenna's voice cut like steel.

Liam turned to Milo. "And you?"

Milo shook his head. "No settlement."

Liam sighed. "They're still family. Burning bridges helps no one."

Jenna's laugh was ice. "We appreciate the concern, but we won't yield."

Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.
###Chapter 96

Jenna Roland let out a cold laugh. She wished that entire family would rot behind bars.

Reconciliation? In their dreams.

Officer Liam Hill closed his notebook when he saw their resolute expressions. "You're free to go. We'll notify you of the final outcome."

Milo Roland scratched his head. "But you don't have our contact information."

"Leave your number." Officer Hill handed him a notepad.

Milo turned to his sister. "I can't answer calls during class. Use yours."

Jenna swiftly wrote down her number with clear annotations.

By the time they stepped out of the police station, the sun was high overhead. Jenna took her brother to a nearby restaurant.

After ordering, Milo frowned. "Sis, what if they come after us when they're released?"

Jenna kept her eyes on her phone as she replied to Stella Laurent's message. "Keep the voice recorder on you. If they dare show up, we'll send them right back to jail."

"But they know about the recorder now. What if they search me—"

Jenna paused mid-text. "Want me to buy you a more discreet one?"

"Too expensive!" Milo waved his hands. "I'll ask Ryan Watson to record for me."

"You think he'd take that risk?"

"We've got each other's backs." Milo thumped his chest confidently.

Jenna thought of the boy whose parents were always absent and silently noted the debt.

Three dishes and a soup arrived quickly. After lunch, Jenna personally escorted Milo to the school gates.

Back home, she took a nap and restocked groceries before heading to work on her e-bike.

Halfway there, her phone rang. She pulled over—Officer Hill's name flashed on the screen.

"Good afternoon." Jenna answered.

A steady voice came through. "The verdict's in. Fifteen days detention and a two-thousand-dollar fine. This outcome—"

Jenna's grip on the handlebars turned her knuckles white.
###Chapter 97

"Officer Hill, if I give them the money, will that prove their extortion?" Jenna Roland gripped her phone, knuckles turning white.

The voice on the other end confirmed, "Exactly. It'll complete the evidence chain. The sentencing will be harsher."

"Understood. Thank you."

Hanging up, Jenna mounted her e-bike and sped toward Studio 54.

From a distance, she spotted Victor Roland and Heidi Roland standing like sentinels at the club's entrance. The security guards ignored them since they weren't causing trouble.

Heidi's sharp eyes caught sight of Jenna first. "Jenna!" she shrieked.

Victor whirled around, his face darkening instantly. He stormed toward her, spittle flying. "You ungrateful wretch! The Roland family housed you for five years, and this is how you repay us?"

Jenna's chest heaved.

The audacity of their twisted logic nearly made her laugh.

"Victor, your wife and son committed extortion, and you're blaming me?" Jenna's voice dripped ice. "The law treats everyone equally. They dug their own grave."

Heidi cut in, "We're family! How can you be so heartless?"

"Family?" Jenna's gaze turned razor-sharp. "When Milo and I lived with you, we paid rent and expenses every month. What did you ever do besides skimp on our meals?"

The couple fell silent.

Jenna crossed her arms. "Keep demanding money. I'll keep paying. It'll just send your whole family to prison faster."

Victor suddenly lurched forward, his rancid breath hitting her face. "Want the orchard? Over my dead body!"

Jenna froze—then burst into laughter. When it ceased, her eyes had frosted over completely.
###Chapter 98

"My most urgent need right now is money for Milo's treatment." Jenna's voice was icy. "Otherwise I'd have hired a lawyer already. Considering you've managed the orchard these years, I'll give you a few more months. But what's rightfully mine—I will take it all back!"

"Dream on! That orchard is mine now. No lawyer can change that!" Victor Roland's neck stiffened with defiance.

Jenna's gaze turned glacial, though a cold smile played on her lips. "We'll see about that."

The ruthless glint in her eyes sent an involuntary shiver down Victor's spine. He'd never seen this side of Jenna before—it unsettled him.

Heidi quickly interjected, "Jenna, let's forget the past. Just tell the police it was all a misunderstanding so Jason and Fiona can come home."

"Sure." Jenna agreed breezily.

Heidi's eyes lit up. "Really?"

"Of course not." Jenna smirked. "Want me to drop the charges? Simple—return my orchard. I'll go to the station right now."

"Over my dead body!" Victor exploded. "That orchard stays with me!"

"Then enjoy their two-week stay in detention." Jenna turned to leave. "Though I imagine the family gossip will be quite entertaining once they're out."

Victor stormed off in a rage.

Heidi hurried after him. "Dad, we came to negotiate! How can she agree if you act like this?"

"Didn't you hear her demands?" Victor hissed through clenched teeth. "That orchard brings in hundreds of thousands a year. Hand it over and we starve!"

"But Mom and Jason—"

"Two weeks won't kill them!" Victor waved impatiently. "Let the relatives talk all they want."

Heidi bit her lip. She knew what the orchard meant to the family—Victor would never relinquish it.

"What about... asking Sean to intervene?" she suggested suddenly. "He gets along with Jenna."

Victor paused mid-step, eyes lighting up. He immediately pulled out his phone and dialed Sean's number.
###Chapter 99

Jenna Roland had just settled into the lounge when her phone rang abruptly.

She pulled it out. The screen displayed "Sean Roland."

Her finger hovered over the answer button as she frowned slightly. At this hour, it was almost certainly about that matter.

"Hey, big bro."

"Busy?" Sean's voice came through the receiver.

"Just finished work." She tucked the phone between her ear and shoulder, leisurely twisting open a bottle of water.

Two seconds of silence.

"Uncle just called me. Said Jason and Mom got detained for extortion. Is it true?"

Jenna took a sip of water, letting out a soft chuckle.

"This is the third time they've harassed Milo this month." Her fingers tapped lightly against the bottle. "If you're calling to plead their case, save your breath."

To her surprise, Sean actually laughed.

"Wasn't planning to." His tone was light. "A few days of reflection might do them good."

The water bottle tilted in Jenna's grip.

"That's your mother and brother." She narrowed her eyes. "You're serious?"

"Adults should face consequences for their actions." His voice remained calm. "I've seen how they've treated you all these years."

Jenna suddenly burst into laughter.

"Big bro, you really are nothing like them."

"Wouldn't deserve to be your brother otherwise." He half-joked.

"Come by the club sometime. Drinks on me." She twirled a strand of hair around her finger. "And... thanks. For everything."

"Deadline crunch right now. Rain check." The rustle of papers came through the line. "Gotta go."

The call ended with a beep.

Sean set his phone down and stepped into the shower. Hot water streamed over him as steam fogged the mirror.

Ten minutes later, he settled onto the couch with instant noodles. The evening news played on the TV.

His phone vibrated again.

Caller ID: Victor Roland.

"Yeah." Sean answered, slouching against a throw pillow.

"What did Jenna say?" Victor's voice barked through the phone.

"She refused." A slurp of noodles. "Expected."

"Bullshit!" Victor roared. "With your relationship, how could she say no?"

"Uncle." Sean set down his fork. "You know what you did to them."

A heavy thud sounded on the other end.

"That little bitch! Should've let her die with her worthless parents—"

"Victor!" Sean shot to his feet. "That's your brother's child!"

Noodle broth splattered across the coffee table, spreading in an oily stain.
###Chapter 100

Sean Roland had just ended the call when his phone began vibrating violently again.

The word "Father" on the screen burned his eyes.

He let out a cold laugh and powered off the device.

On the TV, a variety show reached its climax, the guests roaring with laughter.

Sean leaned back on the sofa, exhaling a long, heavy breath.

...

At 3 a.m., the neon lights of Studio 54 gradually dimmed.

Jenna Roland rubbed her sore neck and hailed a taxi.

"Beverly Hills," she murmured, closing her tired eyes.

As the car entered the neighborhood, the driver suddenly lowered his voice. "Miss, that black car has been tailing us the whole way."

Jenna's eyes snapped open.

In the rearview mirror, a black Volkswagen Passat lurked in the shadows beyond the streetlight's reach.

"Keep driving," she said, her fingers tightening around her bag strap until her knuckles turned white.

The taxi accelerated, leaving the neighborhood behind.

Three lane changes. Two red lights. The car clung to them like a shadow.

"Take me to the police station," Jenna whispered, her voice trembling.

The cityscape blurred past the window as she stared fixedly at the rearview mirror.

Same model. Same license plate. Maintaining a steady twenty-meter distance.

Only insiders had access to the club's schedule.

Jason was still in detention. Her uncle's family lived on the outskirts of the city.

Her phone lit up with Sophia Merouin's latest social media update—a photo from a midnight bar.

The location tag read: Nightfall CLUB, just two blocks from Studio 54.

Jenna bit her lower lip and dialed Ethan Roscente's number.

"Someone's following me," she said softly. "Don't tell Milo."
###Chapter 101

Sophia Merouin held a grudge against Jenna Roland after that night at Studio 54.

As Jenna got into the car after work, she spotted the black Volkswagen Passat tailing her in the rearview mirror.

Her lips curled into a cold smile as her fingers tapped lightly on her knee.

Sophia didn't waste any time seeking revenge.

"Take me to the police station," Jenna suddenly told the driver.

The car changed direction, and the Volkswagen immediately turned the opposite way at the intersection.

Only then did Jenna relax her tense shoulders.

"Change of plans. Beverly Hills, please."

It was 4 AM by the time she got home.

Dawn was breaking as she finally crawled into bed after her shower.

She slept like the dead until the shrill alarm jolted her awake.

Her phone screen lit up with an incoming call from Grandma Blanche.

"Jenna dear, don't bother cooking lunch. Grandma's treating you to a restaurant today."

Rubbing her eyes, Jenna protested, "Eating out is too expensive. Let's just—"

"Ethan's coming too," Blanche interrupted. "He already agreed."

Jenna's words died in her throat.

"And another thing," Blanche said meaningfully, "you're legally married now. Stop calling him 'Mr. Roscente' all the time."

Heat rushed to Jenna's ears.

Calling him by his first name? Just imagining it made her fingertips tingle.

"Let's take it slow..." she mumbled.

Blanche chuckled on the other end. "Fine, start with his name first. There'll be plenty of opportunities for more intimate terms later."

Jenna nearly dropped her phone.
###Chapter 102

"Be at The French Laundry by eleven sharp. I've already reserved a table."

"Got it, Grandma Blanche."

"Don't forget to bring Milo. Studying is exhausting—he needs proper nutrition."

Jenna Roland held her phone, her lips curling into an involuntary smile. Grandma Blanche's concern warmed her heart.

She ended the call and stared absently out the window.

Who would've thought she'd end up married to a man like Ethan Roscente? Or that she'd find such warmth in Grandma Blanche's family?

Losing her parents young, enduring her uncle's cruelty—she'd known nothing but cold shoulders growing up.

Meeting Ethan and Grandma Blanche's family was the first time she'd truly experienced what home felt like.

Shaking off her thoughts, Jenna headed to the bathroom to freshen up.

She applied light makeup and slipped into a pastel dress. The girl in the mirror glowed with vitality, her eyes bright.

Grabbing her purse, she hailed a cab straight to The French Laundry.

She texted Milo to meet her there after class. Her younger brother was still in lectures and didn't reply.

Thirty minutes later, the taxi pulled up outside the restaurant.

Jenna scanned the QR code to pay, then dialed Grandma Blanche's number after stepping out.

"Grandma, I'm here. Where are you?"

"On our way. Just give my name and wait in the private room."

"Okay."

She hung up but decided to wait outside. Sitting alone in a private room sounded unbearably dull.

Ten minutes later, a sleek black luxury sedan glided into view.

Jenna glanced at it. That eight-figure vehicle definitely wasn't Grandma Blanche's ride.

Little did she know, Grandma Blanche and Grandpa Harrison Roscente were inside.

"That girl! I told her to wait inside," Grandma Blanche fretted, slapping her knee. "Now the jig's up."

Grandpa Harrison acted fast. "Zhang, pull over at the next intersection."

The car silently turned into an alley.

"We need to change the emblem," Grandpa Harrison muttered as they walked. "This hiding routine is getting old."

Grandma Blanche brightened. "Brilliant idea. We'll have our son handle it."

They strolled casually toward the restaurant like any elderly couple out for a walk.

"Grandma! Grandpa!" Jenna hurried over. "Why are you coming from that direction?"

Grandpa Harrison waved dismissively. "Don't ask. That driver insisted he couldn't stop here—made us walk halfway across town."
###Chapter 103

Jenna frowned. "Was it a licensed cab?"

Grandma Blanche and Grandpa Harrison exchanged glances.

Licensed cab?

What did she mean?

Grandpa Harrison gave a vague response.

Jenna nodded knowingly. "They must have rigged the meter. The longer the detour, the more they earn. These drivers are ruthless. If I ever catch one, I'll report them immediately."

Grandma Blanche forced a laugh. "At our age, we don't pay much attention to these things."

"You should be more assertive when taking cabs," Jenna said seriously. "That way, drivers won't dare take advantage of you."

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became. The driver must have targeted them because they were elderly.

Preying on seniors was downright despicable.

Grandpa Harrison nodded repeatedly. "You're absolutely right, Jenna. We'll be more careful next time."

Grandma Blanche changed the subject. "Did you message your brother?"

"I texted him," Jenna checked her phone. "He should be here soon."

Beverly Hills was far, but Milo's school was nearby. He could arrive within half an hour.

"Let's go inside and wait." Grandma Blanche tugged Jenna toward the entrance.

Grandpa Harrison watched their linked hands with a pang of jealousy.

Usually, Grandma Blanche would loop her arm through his.

Now, she'd abandoned him without a second thought.

He sighed inwardly.

For his grandson's future happiness, he'd endure it.

A server led them to a private dining room.

Grandma Blanche handed the menu to Jenna. "Order whatever you like, dear."

"You choose, Grandma," Jenna declined politely. "I'm not picky."

Knowing she was being considerate, Grandma Blanche didn't insist.

When Grandma Blanche proceeded to order over a dozen dishes, Jenna quickly intervened. "Grandma, that's too much. We can't finish all this."

More importantly, the prices here were outrageous.

A simple tomato omelet cost over a hundred dollars. Steamed pork ribs were priced at three hundred. It was practically daylight robbery.

Grandma Blanche smiled warmly. "My pension just came in. Treating you is no trouble at all. Don't worry about it."

Jenna sighed inwardly.

Letting seniors spend their pension money on meals didn't sit right with her.

Fine. She'd pay the bill later.

After pouring tea, the server excused himself.

Jenna suddenly remembered something. "Shouldn't we wait for Ethan before ordering?"
###Chapter 104

Ethan Roscente had always been particular about food. Jenna Roland worried silently that Grandma Blanche's choices might not suit his refined palate.

"Let him eat or not," Grandma Blanche waved dismissively. "We're ordering first."

Jenna pressed her lips together and didn't insist.

The private dining room door swung open. Milo Roland entered, followed closely by Ethan.

Grandma Blanche arched an eyebrow. "How did you two end up together?"

Milo glanced at the silent Ethan before explaining, "We ran into Mr. Roscente downstairs and came up together."

"Take your seats," Grandma Blanche gestured.

Milo sat beside Jenna and nodded respectfully at Grandpa Harrison Roscente. "Good evening, Grandpa Harrison."

The elderly man smiled warmly. "How are your studies progressing, Milo?"

Ethan's gaze swept across the table as he took his seat. "Has the food been ordered?"

Grandma Blanche shot him a glare. "What? Were you waiting for His Highness to personally select the menu?"

Ethan fell silent, rendered speechless.

Turning to Milo, Grandma Blanche's tone softened. "Have you decided which university to attend?"

"University of Southern California," Milo's eyes sparkled with enthusiasm. "Their employment statistics are excellent."

"Ambitious!" Grandma Blanche declared. "We'll cover half your tuition when you're accepted."

Milo waved his hands hastily. "That's unnecessary. I plan to work part-time."

Jenna interjected, "Grandma, I'll handle Milo's tuition. You should save your money for retirement."

Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Ethan's slight frown. Her chest tightened. She couldn't let him misunderstand her intentions regarding the Roscente family's wealth again.

Grandpa Harrison chuckled. "We sponsor many underprivileged students. One more won't make a difference."

"You do charity work?" Milo looked surprised.

"Indeed," Grandpa Harrison nodded. "Every child deserves educational opportunities."

Waiters began serving dishes as Grandma Blanche enthusiastically urged the siblings to eat.

Watching his silent son, Grandpa Harrison couldn't help scolding, "Ethan, did you come here to dine or to practice being mute?"

This dinner was meant to bring the young couple closer, yet his wooden son hadn't uttered a single meaningful word. Grandpa Harrison shook his head in frustration. At this rate, his future daughter-in-law might slip through their fingers.
###Chapter 105

Ethan Roscente had seen through Grandpa Harrison and Grandma Blanche's intentions from the start. He had no desire to attend, but when Grandma Blanche resorted to her usual theatrics of tears and tantrums, he reluctantly gave in.

At the dinner table, Grandpa Harrison's words nearly made him choke. Yet Ethan remained silent, pretending not to hear.

Grandma Blanche frowned at his indifference. "Ethan, Jenna is your wife. How can you treat her so coldly?"

Jenna Roland kept her head down, avoiding Ethan's stormy expression as she picked at her food.

Ethan sighed and turned to Grandma Blanche. "You all seemed to be enjoying yourselves. I didn't want to interrupt. Please, carry on as if I'm not here."

Grandma Blanche paused. It was true—since Milo Roland had arrived, they'd been engrossed in conversation, leaving no room for Ethan to speak.

"At least put some food on Jenna's plate," Grandma Blanche insisted.

For the sake of peace, Ethan reluctantly placed a spare rib in Jenna's bowl.

"Thank you, Mr. Roscente." Jenna was visibly flustered by the gesture.

Grandma Blanche nodded in approval. "From now on, no matter where you are, you must take care of Jenna. Understood?"

"Hmm." Ethan's response was icy.

The meal continued under Grandma Blanche's enthusiastic hosting. Both Jenna and Milo received dishes from her.

After dinner, Jenna excused herself to the restroom.

She made her way to the first-floor reception.

"Check for Private Room 208, please."

The cashier smiled politely. "That will be $3,200, ma'am."

"$3,200?" Jenna's eyes widened. The amount far exceeded her expectations.

The cashier maintained her professional demeanor. "Would you like to review the itemized bill?"

Jenna recalled Grandma Blanche's lavish ordering but hadn't anticipated such a staggering total. Considering the elderly couple's financial situation, she gritted her teeth and pulled out her phone. "I'll pay by scan."

A payment confirmation arrived shortly. Jenna silently thanked her stable income—without it, this expense would have been humiliating.

Unbeknownst to her, Ethan observed everything from the second-floor railing. The restaurant's circular layout gave him a clear view of the first floor.

As Jenna returned upstairs, Ethan turned toward the restroom.
###Chapter 106

Jenna Roland stepped into the restaurant restroom to touch up her makeup.

As she pushed open the door, she nearly collided with Ethan Roscente exiting.

Their eyes locked.

Her fingers tightened unconsciously around her purse strap.

His gaze lingered on her face for a brief second.

"Just arrived?" His voice was icy.

Jenna blinked in surprise.

"Why would you ask that, Mr. Roscente?"

He didn't answer.

Ethan brushed past her, leaving a trail of crisp pine scent in his wake.

She remained rooted to the spot until his footsteps faded down the hallway.

Returning to private room 208, she found the meal already concluded.

Grandma Blanche smiled kindly. "Milo should head back to campus now, dear."

Milo Roland stood to take his leave.

At the checkout counter, Grandma Blanche announced, "Room 208, please."

The cashier beamed. "Already taken care of."

The elderly woman's eyes darted between Jenna and Ethan.

Jenna spoke first. "Mr. Roscente handled it."

Ethan's gaze sharpened instantly.

But he remained silent.

Outside the restaurant, Grandma Blanche squeezed Jenna's hand. "Let Ethan drive you home."

"No need, Grandma." Jenna declined gently. "I have grocery shopping to do."

A black Maybach glided to the curb.

Inside the car, Grandma Blanche fixed Ethan with a stare. "You really paid?"

Ethan leaned back with closed eyes. "Mmm."

"I thought the girl did it." The old woman sighed. "Times are hard for her now."

Grandpa Harrison interjected, "Be nicer to Jenna! Feelings can grow."

Ethan's eyelids lifted.

"She will never matter to me."

The elderly man slapped the seat in frustration.

But seeing his grandson's stony profile, he said nothing more.
###Chapter 107

The midday sun filtered through sheer curtains a week later, casting golden patterns across the dining table. Jenna Roland had just placed the final dish when the sound of a turning lock echoed through the apartment.

Ethan Roscente stepped inside, his suit jacket draped over one arm.

"Wash up for lunch," Jenna said without looking up as she arranged the cutlery.

Ethan's gaze lingered on the empty chair opposite him. "Milo isn't here?"

"He went to a classmate's house this morning." Jenna served rice before taking her seat.

Only the clinking of chopsticks against porcelain broke the silence.

Halfway through the meal, Jenna finally spoke. "Mr. Roscente, about those clothes in the wardrobe—"

Her voice trailed off as she stared at her rice bowl. The question had weighed on her all week, but between Ethan's late nights and her own exhaustion, the moment never seemed right.

"Hmm." Ethan didn't glance up from his meal. "Do what you want with them."

Her chopsticks tightened in her grip. "You really didn't need to buy so many—"

"That Dabao moisturizer of yours?" Ethan interrupted abruptly.

Jenna's ears burned. "What's wrong with Dabao? It's affordable and effective!"

Ethan offered no response, letting silence reclaim the dining room.

"Thank you for the clothes," she muttered.

Still no acknowledgment. Jenna shot him a covert glare. Couldn't the man even say "you're welcome"?

The shrill ring of her phone shattered the quiet.

"Milo?" Jenna answered.

"Ms. Roland?" An unfamiliar male voice responded. "This is Inspector Cole Macmillan from LAPD."

Her spine straightened instantly. "Yes, this is she. Is something—"

"Your brother has been detained for assault. Come to the station immediately."

"That's impossible!" Jenna shot to her feet, her chair screeching across the floor. "Milo would never—"

The line went dead.

She collapsed back into her chair, fingers trembling. Milo wouldn't even step on ants as a child. Assault someone? Unthinkable.

Ethan set down his chopsticks, brow furrowing. "What happened?"
###Chapter 108

Jenna's hand trembled as she gripped her phone, her knuckles turning white. She looked up at Ethan, disbelief flooding her eyes.

"Officer Cole said Milo got into a fight at school. The injuries are serious." Her voice shook. "That can't be true. Milo would never hurt anyone."

She had raised her brother herself. No one knew his gentle nature better than she did.

But if the officer's report was accurate, this incident could ruin Milo's academic future.

"Mr. Roscente." Jenna stepped closer, fingers twisting anxiously. "I need your help."

Ethan set down his fork. His piercing gaze remained icy. "Speak."

"If Milo really did this..." She bit her lip. "Could you intervene? I don't want him expelled."

Since their parents' deaths, relatives had turned their backs. In Los Angeles, she had no one to rely on.

Her only hope now was Ethan. As an HM Group executive, he had the connections to handle this.

"How?" Ethan arched a brow, expression indifferent.

"Just keep him from being detained or kicked out." Desperation edged her voice. "I'll repay you."

Ethan dabbed his mouth with a napkin and stood.

"Unnecessary." His tone was flat. "He's technically my brother-in-law."

Jenna's eyes brightened. "Thank you, Mr. Roscente."

"Move."

He strode toward the door. Jenna scrambled after him, grabbing her purse.

Since marrying Jenna, Ethan's lifestyle had plummeted. His Rolls-Royce replaced by an Audi Q7. Even his chauffeur had been revoked by Grandpa Harrison's orders.

The mighty HM Group CEO now drove himself—all thanks to Jenna.

To maintain his "commoner husband" persona for the old man, he'd made these humiliating concessions.

The Audi sped toward the police station.

Jenna studied the unfamiliar interior from the passenger seat.

"You changed cars?" she ventured timidly.

"Hmm." Ethan kept his eyes on the road.

"The previous one seemed nicer—"

"Ms. Roland." His interruption was sharp. "You talk too much."

Jenna immediately fell silent, lowering her head.

Noticing her dejected expression, Ethan surprised himself by explaining: "It was a loaner from a friend."

Jenna blinked, unprepared for this rare moment of clarification.

"I see," she murmured.
###Chapter 109

Ethan Roscente's car came to a smooth stop outside the police station.

Jenna Roland strode briskly into the lobby with Ethan following closely behind. After explaining the situation to the officer on duty, they were led toward the mediation room.

Before reaching the door, a shrill female voice pierced through the walls.

"You ill-bred brats!"

Pushing the door open, they saw a middle-aged woman with permed curls slamming her palm on the table. She fell silent upon seeing the newcomers.

"Inspector Cole, this is Milo Roland's sister," the escorting officer introduced.

Inside the room sat Inspector Cole Macmillan in uniform, accompanied by two women—one in her forties, the other with graying hair.

"This is Mrs. Xu, the mother of the injured student, and his grandmother Mrs. Zhou," Inspector Cole explained briefly.

From the corner, Milo's head snapped up. "Jenna!"

Jenna rushed to his side in three quick strides. The teenager's face was a patchwork of bruises, his lip split and bleeding.

Her heart clenched painfully.

"What happened?" Jenna's voice trembled.

Xu Chan shoved herself between them. "So you're his sister?"

Grandma Zhou jabbed a finger near Jenna's face. "Look what your brother did! You're not leaving until we get justice!"

Jenna ignored them both, gripping Milo's shoulders. "Tell me everything."

The boy's lips quivered. "Sheng Fei... he said things about you in class..."

"What things?"

"That you... work as an escort at Studio 54..." Milo's voice dropped to a whisper. "And that he'd... come find you there..."

Jenna's chest heaved.

"He kept saying horrible things. I... I lost control..." Milo's fists cracked audibly.

Xu Chan screeched, "How dare you justify violence? My son's leg is broken! No wonder—fatherless street rats!"

Jenna whirled around, her gaze glacial.
###Chapter 110

Jenna Roland's gaze turned razor-sharp, piercing straight through Xenia's heart.

Xenia stumbled half a step back under that glare.
Then she straightened, thinking of her wailing son in the hospital bed. "I said you were raised without a mother's guidance! Your brother broke my son's leg. You owe me an explanation today!"

Jenna smirked. "Ethan has both parents, yet he still bites like a rabid dog. Auntie, do you know liars get their tongues ripped out in hell?"

Xenia paled. "How dare you!"

"I said your son needs discipline for his filthy mouth." Jenna narrowed her eyes. "If you don't teach him, next time I'll knock out every tooth in his head."

Zoe lunged forward, claws out. "You little bitch!"

Jenna sidestepped with disdain. "Old hag, touching you would dirty my hands. When you die, the devil will settle your debts."

Zoe trembled with rage, her bony fingers shaking.

Ethan Roscente observed with crossed arms, amusement flickering in his eyes.

Xenia shrieked, "Everyone knows you work as an escort! How dare you act so high and mighty with that dirty money?"

Jenna calmly pulled out her phone. "The police station has surveillance footage. Inspector Cole, what's the penalty for defamation?"

Inspector Cole cleared his throat. "We'd need concrete evidence."

Jenna turned to her brother. "Milo, did your classmates hear Ethan spreading rumors?"

Milo nodded. "Ryan recorded it."

Xenia's face turned ashen.

Jenna waved her phone. "With Inspector Cole as witness, this woman just committed public defamation. I can provide employment records anytime. Now—who's apologizing?"

The surveillance camera's red light blinked silently.
###Chapter 111

"Of course I have evidence." Jenna Roland's lips curved into a faint smile, but her eyes remained icy. "The owner of Studio 54, my clients, and colleagues can all testify for me."

Zhou Xian'e paled at her confident tone.

If this actually went to court, her family would never know peace again.

"Stop with this nonsense!" Zhou Xian'e snapped, desperation creeping into her voice. "We still haven't settled the matter of your brother assaulting my grandson!"

Jenna's gaze sharpened. "Then let's discuss how Sheng Fei attacked my brother first."

"Lies!" Zhou Xian'e pointed at Milo Roland. "Look at him—there's not a scratch! Clearly, your brother was the aggressor!"

"Are you blind?" Jenna scoffed. "My brother has bruises around his eye and blood on his lip. A medical exam might even reveal internal injuries."

She turned to the officer, her tone measured. "Sheng Fei slandered me as an escort girl. My brother only defended my honor. But Sheng Fei fought back—these injuries are proof."

"After the medical examination, I'll be filing defamation charges against both Mrs. Xu and Sheng Fei." Her eyes swept over the room. "Everyone here is a witness."

Inspector Cole Macmillan suppressed his surprise. In all his years on the force, he'd rarely encountered such a composed and articulate civilian.

Ethan Roscente's eyes flickered with unexpected interest. This sharp-tongued woman was proving far more intriguing than he'd anticipated.

"Under Penal Code Article 246," Inspector Cole stated gravely, "severe cases of defamation can result in up to three years' imprisonment."

Xu Chan and Zhou Xian'e turned ashen.

They never imagined their idle gossip could land them in legal trouble.

"No rush." Jenna smiled coolly. "I'll take my brother for his medical exam first. Inspector Cole, please assign an officer to accompany us—lest anyone accuse us of fleeing."

Officer Liam Hill arrived promptly. He recognized Jenna immediately—he'd handled Fiona Roland's extortion case previously.

Ethan's phone suddenly rang.

"Don't let us keep you," Jenna said politely. "I'll reach out if needed."

Her use of "Mr. Roscente" made both officers glance sharply at Ethan.

Without a backward glance, Ethan strode out of the mediation room.
###Chapter 112

"Who was that man just now?" Inspector Cole Macmillan frowned deeply.

Jenna Roland looked up at him. "A friend of mine. Do you know him, Inspector?"

"What's his name? That surname is quite rare." His tone carried a hint of probing.

"Ethan Roscente."

The air instantly froze.

Inspector Cole's pupils constricted sharply.

Officer Liam Hill also showed a stunned expression.

Ethan Roscente?

The second son of the prestigious Roscente family in Los Angeles?

The rumored wealthiest man in the world?

How could someone like that appear at a police station?

And have any connection with an escort girl?

It must be a case of identical names.

Jenna noticed their odd reaction. "Do you two know him?"

"Not personally." Inspector Cole waved his hand. "Might have heard the name during investigations. Officer Hill will take your brother for the medical examination."

Jenna bowed slightly to Liam. "Thank you for your trouble."

The group exited the police station.

Zhou Xian'e and Xu Chan followed behind, their palms sweating.

If the examination revealed serious injuries...

Plus Jenna pressing charges...

The consequences would be disastrous!

The police car headed toward the hospital.

Midway, Liam suddenly spoke. "Miss Roland, does your brother have congenital heart disease?"

Zhou and Xu trembled violently.

Heart disease?

If he'd had an episode during the altercation...

Sheng Fei would be finished!

What if the hospital found other conditions too...

The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law exchanged glances.

Cold sweat drenched their backs.

Jenna sat in the rear seat. "Yes. We couldn't afford the surgery, so it's been untreated."

She suddenly turned to look at the two women.

They immediately stiffened.

Zhou's voice shook. "W-why are you staring at us?"
###Chapter 113

Jenna Roland crossed her arms, fingertips tapping lightly against her sleeves.

"My brother has a weak heart," she murmured, her voice feather-light. "When the test results come out, I hope you're prepared to face the consequences."

The car fell into abrupt silence.

Zhou Xian'e and Xu Chan both stiffened in their seats.

Xu Chan dug her nails into her palms. "His medical condition has nothing to do with us!"

"Oh, but it does." Jenna lifted her gaze. "Your son's punch could have triggered a severe deterioration." She paused. "Medical bills, emotional damages, long-term treatment—surely you're not planning to skip out on paying?"

"You—!" Xu Chan's voice rose sharply. "My son is still hospitalized!"

Jenna nodded. "I'll cover every cent of his expenses." Her eyes flicked to the neon lights streaking past the window. "But my brother's bills? You'd better be ready to pay up too."

From the driver's seat, Liu Shen tightened his grip on the steering wheel. "How much for the surgery?"

"One point two million." The number left Jenna's lips just as the rearview mirror caught the redness rimming her eyes. "After our parents passed, it's just been the two of us."

Milo Roland suddenly broke into violent coughing from the passenger seat.

Liu Shen hesitated before offering tissues. He'd seen plenty of girls hustling drinks at clubs, but never one whose white blouse was worn thin from too many washes.

"Working at a place like that..." He couldn't help himself.

"Pays well." Jenna cut him off. "Once his surgery's done, I'm quitting."

A muffled sob came from the backseat. Milo buried his face in his school uniform sleeve, the fabric darkening with tears. He remembered the sound of his sister's footsteps returning at 3 AM, the scars on her hands from broken bottles.

Zhou Xian'e tugged at Xu Chan's sleeve. Both mothers stared at the girl's scuffed heels and said nothing more.

The wail of an ambulance grew closer. As Jenna pushed the car door open, Liu Shen murmured, "Let me see the medical records."

The night wind lifted her thin shirt, revealing the pain-relief patch on her waist.
###Chapter 114

The car had barely stopped when Jenna told Liam and the others to wait at the hospital entrance.

She tugged at Milo's sleeve, signaling for him to stay.

Milo kept his head down, his bangs shadowing his eyes.

He didn't want his sister to see the redness in them.

Jenna tilted her head closer, determined to get a good look at his bloodshot eyes.

"Oh? Since when does our little tough guy cry golden tears?"

Milo turned his face away, his voice muffled. "I'm not crying."

The hoarseness in his tone betrayed him.

Jenna chuckled softly, standing on tiptoe to ruffle his hair.

"Remember to say your chest hurts during the examination."

Milo jerked his head up, confusion written across his face. "Why?"

"You hit Ethan pretty hard." Jenna lowered her voice. "If you don't make it seem serious, that shrew of a mother won't let this go."

Milo frowned. "But aren't you suing them for defamation?"

"That'll only scare them temporarily." Jenna's lips curled into a cold smile. "If they find out you're fine while Ethan's badly hurt, you'll get expelled for sure. We'd have to pay compensation too."

Milo clenched his fists. "I'm sorry, sis. I shouldn't have fought back."

"Silly boy." Jenna poked his forehead. "You fight back when someone bullies you—that's my brother. So what if we have to pay? I'll just take on more clients."

Milo's eyes reddened again.

Jenna pulled him into a tight hug, gently patting his back. "Don't be afraid. I've got you."

Milo buried his face in her shoulder and gave a muffled "Mm."

By the time they entered the hospital, Liam had been waiting at the entrance for a while.

Registration, payment, examinations—throughout the entire process, Milo kept frowning.

During the MRI, he suddenly clutched his chest. "Doctor, it hurts here."

The doctor immediately grew concerned and urged them to visit the thoracic surgery department for further checks.

Jenna remained calm. This was exactly the reaction she'd anticipated.

But Xu Chan, standing nearby, panicked.

Her eyes locked onto Milo's pale face, her fingers trembling uncontrollably.

If Milo really had heart problems—on top of the defamation charges—her family would be ruined!
###Chapter 115

Jenna Roland arrived at Los Angeles General Hospital with her brother Milo at dawn. This time, she specifically booked an appointment with Dr. Zhou, the chief cardiothoracic specialist. The previous routine check-up results had left her uneasy.

The waiting area was packed. The sharp scent of disinfectant hung in the air. Milo slumped in his chair, his face paler than usual.

"Number 36 to Exam Room 3," the automated voice announced.

Jenna helped her brother up. Ethan and Daisy followed them inside. Dr. Zhou was reviewing medical records on his computer.

"What seems to be the problem?" The doctor adjusted his glasses.

Jenna detailed Milo's medical history and handed over a thick stack of test results. Dr. Zhou studied each report, his frown deepening.

"Rib fracture on the left side. The heart condition is more concerning." He set down the documents. "Was he previously diagnosed with congenital heart disease?"

"Yes, the tests confirmed it was congenital." Jenna clenched her fists. "We've been managing it with medication due to financial constraints. Doctor, how serious is it now?"

Dr. Zhou removed his glasses and rubbed his temples. "Medication only slows progression. Surgery is strongly recommended. The optimal treatment window was during infancy. Delaying further increases the risks."

Jenna's throat tightened. "I understand, but the cost—"

"Prolonging this could lead to organ failure. Surgical risks would double by then." His tone turned grave. "Young patients recover faster. The sooner, the better."

"Is a heart transplant necessary?" Her voice trembled.

The doctor nodded. "The structural deformity is severe. Conventional surgery won't correct it. With post-op anti-rejection therapy, total expenses would be around eight to nine hundred thousand."

The figure made Jenna's vision blur. Despite years of saving, she was still far short.

"Doctor, he complained of severe chest pain today..." Her voice cracked with urgency.

"Could be from the fracture, or the medication losing efficacy." Dr. Zhou suggested, "Hospitalization for observation would be prudent."

Daisy suddenly interjected, "Is he dying or something?"

"Shut your mouth!" Jenna whirled around, eyes blazing. "My brother will live to a hundred. You'll die first!"

Daisy recoiled, face purpling with suppressed rage.

Ignoring the outburst, Dr. Zhou continued, "The fractured rib is dangerously close to the thoracic cavity. I advise—"

Milo suddenly convulsed with violent coughs. Bright red blood splattered across the pristine medical forms.
###Chapter 116

"Without prompt treatment, this could lead to chronic pain and recurrent infections." Director Zhou adjusted his glasses. "Given the patient's history of congenital heart disease, any cardiac infection would have devastating consequences."

Jenna Roland clenched the hem of her shirt. She had only asked her brother Milo to fake chest pains—never expecting actual rib fractures to show up on the scans.

Now the pretense wasn't even necessary.

"Admit him, then." Jenna took a steadying breath.

Director Zhou swiftly prepared the hospitalization forms. At the payment counter, Jenna stared at the staggering number on the bill, her fingers trembling slightly.

After settling Milo into his IV drip, Jenna summoned Mrs. Xu and Liu Shen to the hallway.

"Auntie, here are the examination and hospitalization fees." Jenna handed over a stack of invoices. "Will you be paying cash or transferring the funds?"

Mrs. Xu's hand froze mid-air.

Thirty-eight thousand!

"How could it be this expensive?" Her voice cracked.

Jenna's expression remained impassive. "Where's your son's medical report?"

Though Sheng Fei had been injured by Milo, her brother's condition was far more severe. This accounting needed to be settled properly.

Mrs. Xu hastily shoved the papers back at Jenna. "I need to make a call."

On the other end, Sheng Qingming sounded unconcerned. "Fei just had a nosebleed and some bruises. He'll be discharged after the checkup."

"What?" Mrs. Xu slammed her fist against the wall. "Milo has fractured ribs and a heart condition! This is a disaster!"

"How could—"

"That little bastard Sheng Fei!" Mrs. Xu hissed through gritted teeth. "How much were your tests?"

"A little over three thousand."

Mrs. Xu's vision darkened. Three thousand versus thirty-eight thousand—this was a losing bargain. And now they faced Jenna's defamation lawsuit on top of it.

Leaning against the wall, she felt her blood pressure skyrocket.
###Chapter 117

Jenna Roland slammed the phone down with force. When she turned to face Ethan Roscente, a flicker of panic crossed her face.

"Ethan, about that—"

His gaze turned icy. "Trying to back out?"

Jenna glanced at Liam Hill standing nearby and quickly waved her hands. "No, no! My son's medical bills came to over three thousand."

"Fine." Ethan's expression remained impassive. "Deduct three thousand. Transfer thirty-five thousand to me."

Jenna gritted her teeth as she completed the transfer. The moment her phone chimed with the notification, Ethan spoke again. "Forty thousand upfront for treatment. Any excess will be refunded, any shortage covered."

Her face instantly paled.

She had planned to extort a hundred thousand from Milo Roland, only to find his injuries were far worse. Now not only was she getting nothing, she had to pay out of pocket.

"Plus compensation for emotional distress," Ethan added.

"On what grounds?" Jenna clenched her fists.

"Your son nearly killed my brother." Ethan's voice was glacial. "He has congenital heart disease. He could drop dead any second. Are you paying for that trauma or not?"

If Jenna hadn't been so aggressive at the police station, if her son hadn't been bullying Milo at school, Ethan wouldn't have been this ruthless.

With people like her, mercy was just enabling.

Seeing Jenna's defiance, Ethan smirked. "Your son's an adult now. Assault plus defamation—that's enough for jail time. A criminal record would ruin his life."

Since the orchard dispute, Ethan had studied legal statutes inside out. Every word struck like a blade, leaving Jenna scrambling.

"What do you want?" Jenna forced the words through gritted teeth.

Ethan held her gaze. "Pay what's owed. Apologize where due. Your son assaulted my brother. You spread vicious rumors. Today, you will answer for this."

Jenna made a call with a face like thunder. Half an hour later, Oliver Macmillan appeared at the hospital room door with his son Zachary.

"What's going on?" Oliver looked at Liam.

Jenna yanked Zachary forward. "Why did you spread those lies at school? Saying Milo's sister was some kind of escort?"

Zachary sneered at Ethan. "Isn't she? Was I wrong?"

Jenna slapped him across the face.

"Apologize! Now!"

Zachary jutted his chin. "She is an escort. Why should I apologize?"
###Chapter 118

Jenna Roland took a deep breath, her eyes icy cold. She glared at the woman. "Compensation for emotional distress and medical bills—not a penny less. And expect court summons soon."

She turned to Liam Hill with a nod and strode into the hospital room, slamming the door shut behind her.

Inside, Milo Roland lay on the bed with an IV drip. Jenna sat beside him, gently holding his hand. "Don't worry. I'm here."

Milo's eyes reddened, his voice choked. "I'm sorry, sis. I caused trouble again."

"Don't be silly." She patted his hand. "Rest. I'll watch over you."

His rib fracture wasn't severe. The doctors opted for conservative treatment—a small mercy given his congenital heart disease.

Soon, Milo drifted into sleep.

The door creaked open as Liam entered, keeping his voice low. "They want to talk again."

Jenna scoffed. "My terms are clear. Pay up and apologize, or we go to court."

"They said Sheng Fei is young. A criminal record would ruin his future—"

"Eighteen is adulthood." She cut him off. "He owns his actions."

Liam sighed and left.

Jenna stayed by the bed, unwavering. With no one else to care for her brother, she dialed Tristan Ashcroft.

"Boss, my brother's hospitalized. I need a week off."

Silence stretched on the line. "A whole week?"

"Problem?" Her tone turned frosty.

"N-No. Take care of him." Tristan reluctantly agreed.

She hung up.

Minutes later, Liam returned.
###Chapter 119

Officer Liam Hill straightened his police uniform collar and knocked lightly on the hospital room door.

Jenna Roland looked up and immediately rose to greet him.

"They've agreed to cover all expenses, including compensation for emotional distress and medical bills," Liam said in a hushed tone. "They're also willing to apologize in person."

Jenna glanced at the sleeping Milo before whispering, "Have them wait outside. He just fell asleep."

Liam nodded, his gaze lingering on the bandaged boy in the bed. "Then consider this matter settled. Don't hesitate to contact me if you need anything."

"Thank you for your help." Jenna gave a slight bow.

After seeing Liam out, Jenna leaned against the window, absently tracing patterns on her phone screen.

A rustling sound came from the bed.

"Awake?" Jenna pocketed her phone and approached.

Milo rubbed his eyes, the bruise on his temple glaring under the sunlight.

"The Fei family is waiting outside to apologize," Jenna said, handing him a glass of water. "Are you willing to accept it?"

"No!" Milo sat up abruptly, water sloshing from the cup.

The insults hurled at his sister were carved into his memory like knives. How could he possibly forgive so easily?

"But—"

"Jenna!" Milo cut her off. "Did he consider the consequences when he hit me in front of the whole school?"

Jenna sighed and took his trembling hand.

"What do you want to do then?"

Milo stared at the white sheets and enunciated each word: "I want him to apologize publicly in front of the entire school."

Outside the room, Fei Sheng was kicking the wall impatiently.

"Behave yourself!" Xu Chan pinched his arm sharply.

The door opened.

Jenna relayed Milo's demand with an impassive expression.

"This..." Xu Chan's face paled.

Fei Sheng started to protest but froze under his father's glare.

"We agree," Sheng Qingming said firmly. "We'll go to the school tomorrow."

Jenna nodded. "As for the compensation—"

"Is fifty thousand enough?" Xu Chan fumbled for her wallet.

"Sixty," Jenna met her eyes. "Including follow-up treatment."

Xu Chan's hands shook, nearly dropping her purse.

"O-okay."

As Jenna closed the door, Xu Chan finally lost her temper and smacked her son's back.

"You good-for-nothing!"

Fei Sheng retorted, "Who asked his sister to work at that kind of place!"

"Shut up!" Sheng Qingming snapped. "Haven't you embarrassed us enough?"

The argument in the hallway seeped through the door cracks. Milo clenched his fists.

"Jenna... Am I being too stubborn?"

She ruffled his hair. "You're just protecting me."

Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting a warm patch of light on the hospital bed.
###Chapter 120

Sheng Qingming smacked Sheng Fei's head so hard the boy staggered.

"You dare complain?" Sheng Qingming hissed through clenched teeth. "Do you have any idea how much your little stunt cost our family?"

Sheng Fei pouted. "I wasn't lying. She really does work as an escort at that club."

Thankfully Jenna wasn't present, or the situation would've escalated further.

Seeing the tension, Xu Chang grabbed Sheng Fei's collar and dragged him away.

......

The next afternoon, Milo Roland had just finished lunch when his phone rang.

"Ryan?" Milo answered, leaning against his hospital bed's headboard.

"Breaking news!" Ryan Watson sounded thrilled. "Sheng Fei apologized to you over the school PA system during recess. I recorded it—want to hear?"

Milo scoffed. "Not interested."

"Suit yourself. By the way, did he really fracture your ribs?"

"What do you think?" Milo snapped. "You think I'm faking this hospital stay?"

"Damn! That bastard went that far? I thought you'd beaten him up worse." Ryan whistled. "Honestly, you shouldn't have let him off so easy."

"You think I wanted to?" Milo lowered his voice. "If it weren't for protecting my sister's reputation, I'd never have agreed to settle."

"Speaking of which, how did Sheng Fei know about Jenna working at the club?"

"Beats me!" Milo's brow furrowed.

Apart from himself, not even Ryan knew about this. How could Sheng Fei...

"I'll look into it. Focus on recovering." Ryan hung up.

Milo set down his phone and glanced at Jenna peeling apples by his bedside. "Sis, won't Mr. Roscente be upset you're not cooking for him?"

"I took leave," Jenna said without looking up. "He said it's fine."

"Good." Milo exhaled in relief.

......

Five days later, Milo was finally discharged.

Jenna headed straight to the market after their early morning return home.

Spotting fresh marrow bones at the butcher's stall, she immediately bought two to make nourishing soup for her brother.

Back home, Jenna started simmering the bone broth, then called Ethan Roscente.

"Mr. Roscente, will you be home for lunch?" she asked softly. After a pause, she nodded. "Understood."

As she hung up, Milo sidled over. "He's coming?"

"Yes." Jenna nodded. "Grandma Blanche too."

"Grandma Blanche?" Milo blinked. "Since when?"

"She called while I was shopping," Jenna explained. "She wants to see you."

Grandma Blanche had known about Milo's hospitalization but was away on a trip. She'd returned yesterday and, learning of Milo's discharge, decided to visit in person.
###Chapter 121

Jenna noticed Milo's wrinkled shirt and frowned slightly.

"Go change your clothes," she said softly.

Milo glanced down at himself and nodded before heading to his room.

In the kitchen, Jenna tied on her apron and checked the wall clock. The hands pointed to ten o'clock—she needed to hurry with lunch preparations.

The stove flame flickered to life as the spatula clinked against the wok.

Milo returned in fresh clothes and silently began washing vegetables.

Time slipped away in the busy kitchen, and soon it was noon.

The doorbell rang precisely at twelve.

"Milo, get the door," Jenna called without looking up from the stove.

Milo set down the dishcloth and strode to the foyer.

Ethan stood at the threshold in a crisp suit, with Grandma Blanche's warm smile glowing behind him.

"Please come in," Milo stepped aside.

Grandma Blanche inhaled deeply as she entered. "Something smells wonderful!"

Ethan's gaze swept the living room before he headed straight for the restroom.

Five steaming dishes already adorned the dining table.

"Jenna, your cooking is simply divine!" Grandma Blanche's eyes crinkled with delight.

Jenna emerged with the final dish, her hair slightly damp with perspiration.

"Lunch is ready," she murmured.

Grandma Blanche eagerly took her seat while Milo poured water for everyone.

"Ethan is truly blessed to have married you," Grandma Blanche praised between bites of braised pork.

Jenna's ears turned pink as she handed Ethan a bowl of rice.

"Thank you." His deep voice resonated.

Her fingers twitched, nearly dropping the bowl. It was the first time Ethan had thanked her.

"Try this," she quickly changed the subject, serving Milo a chicken wing.

Milo's eyes lit up. "You know me best."

Watching their sibling interaction, Grandma Blanche beamed even brighter. The dining room brimmed with cozy warmth—even Ethan's usual stern expression seemed to soften slightly.
###Chapter 122

Grandma Blanche picked up a morsel of food and glanced at Milo with concern. "Milo, how's your recovery going?"

Milo set down his chopsticks and answered politely, "Thank you for asking, Grandma Blanche. I'm feeling much better."

"If anything happens at school, you must tell me." Grandma Blanche patted the back of his hand. "I'll stand up for you."

Milo smiled faintly and nodded.

Grandma Blanche turned to Jenna. "Jenna, how was the matter resolved in the end?"

"The other party compensated for medical expenses and emotional damages." Jenna ladled soup into a bowl. "That student, Sheng Fei, publicly apologized to Milo."

Grandma Blanche hummed thoughtfully, hesitating as if she wanted to say more.

After dinner, Ethan unexpectedly stayed behind to help clear the table.

Jenna looked at him in surprise.

Grandma Blanche cheerfully led Milo to the living room to watch TV.

In the kitchen, Jenna turned on the faucet to wash dishes.

Ethan's tall figure stood beside her, his black suit amplifying his commanding presence.

"Did you need something, Mr. Roscente?" Jenna kept her head down as she spoke.

The water rushed loudly in the sink.

"Quit this job as soon as possible." Ethan's voice was cold.

Jenna's hands paused briefly. Her voice grew quieter. "Milo's surgery will cost nearly a hundred thousand..."

She needed the money.

Ethan had expected Jenna to ask for a loan, but she never did.

"Why not borrow from friends?" he asked instead.

Jenna gave a bitter smile. "That much money isn't a small sum. No one would lend me that kind of amount."

She didn’t want to be burdened with crushing debt.

"Grandma Blanche..." Ethan tested.

"Grandma Blanche lives on her pension. How could I ask her for money?" Jenna shook her head.

Only then did Ethan realize Jenna had no idea of their true identities.

Her closeness to Grandma Blanche wasn’t calculated.

Water droplets slid down the rim of a bowl. Ethan watched Jenna’s busy figure with a complicated expression.
###Chapter 123

Ethan cleared his throat, his fingers tapping lightly on the table.

"I know a renowned surgical specialist. Perhaps he could perform your brother's operation."

Jenna continued washing dishes, water cascading over the plates.

"The main issue isn't finding a doctor. It's the surgery fees."

Ethan's gaze flickered. "I can lend you the money."

"Don't joke." Jenna shook water droplets from her hands. "You just bought a new car and this house. Where would you get spare cash?"

She turned to place a bowl in the cabinet, her tone firm.

"Even if you had it, I wouldn't dare borrow."

Ethan frowned. "Why not?"

"Tens of thousands isn't small change." Jenna dried her hands. "I don't want that kind of pressure."

Ethan's voice lowered. "So you'll keep working at the club?"

"Yes." Jenna nodded. "The money's good there. A few more months should cover it."

Ethan fell silent. After a long look at her, he turned and left.

When Jenna finished cleaning the kitchen, only Grandma Blanche and Milo remained in the living room.

"Mr. Roscente went to the office," Grandma Blanche said cheerfully.

Jenna sent her brother to rest and chatted with the elderly woman.

At 3 PM, Jenna woke from her nap.

She rushed out to run errands, then returned to clean the apartment.

By the time she finished makeup and changed clothes, her shift was about to start.

"I'm leaving," she called out.

At Studio 54's entrance, Stella grabbed her arm.

"Sophia got fired!" Stella whispered. "Heard she had a huge fight with the boss."

Jenna paused. "When?"

"Two days ago." Stella leaned closer. "I bet it's about that last incident."

In the dressing room, Jenna changed while speaking. "Someone followed me the other night."

Stella froze, forgetting to change.

"What happened? Did you see their face?"

"Too dark. Just noticed a black cap." Jenna buttoned her top. "I think Sophia sent them."

Stella gasped, her fingers trembling slightly.
###Chapter 124

"Any other findings?" Stella pressed.

Jenna bit her lip, her fingers absently tracing the edge of her phone. "The stalker followed me all the way to the Beverly Hills gate. I wouldn't have noticed if the taxi driver hadn't pointed it out."

Stella gasped, her brows knitting together. "Who would dare?"

"Either the Rolands or Sophia's hired hand." Jenna smirked coldly. "Only those two have a grudge against me."

"You should report this!" Stella stomped her foot anxiously. "What if something happens?"

Jenna shook her head. "No evidence. If the police come and he denies it, we'll only alert him."

Stella chewed her nail thoughtfully before her eyes lit up. "Buy pepper spray! Carry it with you. If he shows up again, spray him!"

"Already ordered." Jenna waved her phone. "It'll arrive tomorrow."

"That's our Jenna!" Stella gave a thumbs-up.

Under the locker room lights, they quickly changed into work uniforms. Friday nights were always packed, and the manager had emphasized pushing premium drinks.

After the briefing, Stella pulled Jenna into a corner. "How's your brother doing?"

"He'll return to school on Monday." Jenna adjusted her collar when a knock interrupted them.

Patrick peeked in, his forehead glistening with sweat. "Jenna, Tony specifically asked for you."

"Where is he?" Jenna paused.

"VIP Room 308." Patrick lowered his voice. "The boss is in a good mood today. Be careful."

Pushing open the door, Jenna saw Tony Lombardi laughing with Fiona Valrose in his arms. Spotting her, he immediately released Fiona and patted the empty seat beside him.

"Long time no see, Tony." Jenna smiled as she sat down. "You look great."

"How can I not be happy? My wife's pregnant." Tony swirled his glass proudly.

Jenna turned to Fiona in surprise. "Congratulations!"

Fiona stiffened. "It's not me..."

The air in the room froze. Jenna blinked, then quickly recovered. "Oh! You mean Mrs. Lombardi is expecting? Congratulations, Tony!"
###Chapter 125

"Big sister-in-law?" Tony Lombardi blinked before chuckling. "Just call her sister-in-law, no need for the 'big'." He scratched his head. "I told her about you. Knowing you're busy, she asked me to invite you for lunch tomorrow."

He'd deliberately come to Studio 54 tonight—Saturday was perfect. First, to deliver the invitation. Second, to remind Jenna not to slip up in front of his wife.

Jenna Roland hesitated. "Tony, my brother just got discharged from the hospital. I need to take care of him. I really can't make it."

"You have a brother?" His brows furrowed.

"Yeah. Milo Roland. He's a high school sophomore."

"What happened?"

"He got into a fight defending me at school. Fractured ribs. Seven days in the hospital." She sighed. "I can't leave him alone."

Tony's temper flared at the mention of Milo's injuries. "Which bastard dared lay hands on my brother? Give me a name. I'll break his damn arm!"

Jenna hadn't expected this reaction. Or that Tony would claim Milo as his own.

"Tony, he's still in school. The other kid already apologized and paid compensation. Let it go."

"Damn it!" He gritted his teeth. "If it happens again, you call me immediately. I'll end him."

Jenna's eyes crinkled into crescents as she smiled. "Thank you. No one else stands up for us like you do."

He waved a hand, expression solemn. "Always wanted a little sister, but my parents failed me. Now that I've got you, you're family. Of course I'll protect you."

Suddenly, Jenna hugged him. He stiffened before returning the embrace, patting her shoulder with rough affection.

"Bring your brother tomorrow," he said when they parted. "My wife's a great cook. Let him try her food."

With the offer extended like this, refusal was impossible. "Alright."

Tony poured her a glass of water. "No more drinking when you're with me."

"Huh?" She froze.

"How much do you down entertaining clients? It's bad for you. Cut back when you can."

"Thanks, Tony." She raised the water glass like a toast, smiling brilliantly.

Her phone buzzed—a text from Stella Laurent. Tony glimpsed the screen and nudged her. "Go on. Don't worry about me."

"I'll come back after handling this."

"Go." His proud gaze followed her exit. Such a beautiful, capable little sister—his buddies would be green with envy.

Outside VIP Room 888, Jenna took a deep breath and pushed the door open.
###Chapter 126

The dim amber lighting cast long shadows across the private booth where two men sat facing each other.

The man in black drummed his slender fingers against the lacquered table. His chiseled profile looked particularly severe under the mood lighting, radiating an icy aura that seemed to freeze the very air around him.

This was Ethan Roscente—Jenna Roland's husband in name only.

Beside him, Gavin Valentine twirled his wineglass with bored indifference.

Jenna recalled Grandma Blanche's words: "He's just reserved by nature, but has a good heart."

Which decent man frequents nightclubs every day? she thought wryly.

"Good evening, Mr. Roscente, Mr. Valentine." Jenna gave a slight bow, her professional smile flawless.

Gavin arched an eyebrow. "Surprised to see us, Manager Roland?"

"Your patronage honors our establishment." Her smile didn't waver. "What would you like to drink tonight?"

Ethan lifted his gaze, eyes like shards of glacial ice. "Your most expensive vintage."

Jenna's pulse hitched. "The 1974 Romanée-Conti at $260,000 per bottle."

"Two." His tone was as casual as ordering tap water.

Her pupils contracted. This far exceeded their usual spending.

"Problem?" His voice dropped dangerously.

"Right away, sir." Smoothing her expression, she turned—but not before stealing another glance at Ethan.

He'd just bought a new car last week. Where was this sudden extravagance coming from?

"You're paying." Ethan's abrupt statement made Gavin fumble his glass.

"Excuse me?"

Ethan's eyes narrowed lethally.

Gavin gritted his teeth. "...Fine. My treat."

Catching the exchange from the corner of her eye, Jenna barely suppressed a gasp. Now that's what you call friendship goals.
###Chapter 127

The night deepened as Tristan Ashcroft saw off the last group of guests. He loosened his tie and stepped into the elevator.

Patrick Klein hurried over, lowering his voice. "Boss, Mr. Roscente and Mr. Valentine are in VIP Room 888. Guess what they ordered?"

Tristan didn't pause his stride. "The new vintage?"

"Exactly! The most expensive one!" Patrick couldn't hide his excitement. "Jenna Roland is truly our lucky charm!"

Tristan halted mid-step, a flicker of surprise crossing his eyes. He knew better than anyone—that particular wine wasn't even on the recommended list.

"Jenna served them?"

"Yes, it was her again." Patrick nodded eagerly.

After a brief silence, Tristan instructed, "Have the kitchen prepare two signature appetizers for them."

Inside VIP Room 888, Jenna had just finished pouring the wine.

Her phone vibrated. Glancing at the message, she excused herself discreetly.

When she returned, she carried two exquisite small plates.

Gavin Valentine straightened warily. "We didn't order this."

"Compliments of the house." Jenna set the plates down, her gaze briefly skimming over Ethan Roscente.

Once the door closed, Gavin immediately took a bite. "Since when did Tristan become so generous? He was never this hospitable before."

Ethan swirled his glass, the amber liquid catching the light. "Half a million spent, and we get two appetizers in return. Quite the bargain, don't you think?"

"Half a million?!" Gavin nearly leaped from his seat. "Ethan, are you trying to get me killed? My father will skin me alive!"

Ethan lit a cigarette leisurely, exhaling a slow stream of smoke. "The Hudson Yards project..."

Gavin instantly stilled, eyes gleaming.

"Come here once a week. Spend no less than half a million each time." Ethan blew a perfect smoke ring. "And the project is yours."

Gavin's mouth hung open, speechless.

Outside the window, neon lights flickered, casting a ghostly pallor over his face.
###Chapter 128

Ethan Roscente snapped out of his thoughts, his gaze settling on Gavin Valentine's face as his brows furrowed slightly.

"Reason?"

"Don't ask." Ethan's expression remained indifferent, his eyes devoid of any emotion.

Gavin's frown deepened.

Something was off. If Ethan really wanted to drink, he could've just asked Gavin to send a few bottles over. Why bother coming to a place like this?

With Ethan's status, there wasn't a single fine wine he hadn't tasted.

Gavin's eyes involuntarily drifted toward the bar.

Earlier, Ethan had ordered two bottles of Romanée-Conti in one go—the commission on that level of wine was substantial. Was this about Jenna Roland?

Gavin's pupils constricted, shock flashing across his face.

Could Ethan actually have feelings for Jenna?

His expression shifted unpredictably.

Ethan ignored him, picking up his glass and draining it in one go.

"Is this about Jenna?" Gavin leaned in, unable to hold back. "You into her? She is gorgeous. Need a wingman?"

Ethan had no intention of explaining, but to avoid misunderstandings, he spoke anyway. "Her brother's sick and needs surgery money. She refused to borrow it."

"Holy shit!" Gavin shot to his feet, eyes wide. "You actually like her?"

In his eyes, someone as cold as Ethan wouldn't go out of his way to help unless he had feelings for the person.

Ethan shot him an icy glare. "When did I say that?"

"Then why?" Gavin sat back down. "Everyone knows Ethan Roscente doesn't lift a finger unless there's something in it for him. You'd help someone for no reason?"

Ethan crushed the cigarette between his fingers and slammed his glass onto the table.

Gavin felt the chill and scooted away. "Just joking. Don't take it seriously."

"Made up your mind?" Ethan's gaze was razor-sharp.

Gavin forced a laugh. "For old times' sake, how about $260,000? That's exactly the price of one bottle."

Ethan's expression didn't waver. "Non-negotiable."
###Chapter 129

Gavin's lips twitched as he pressed his palms together in a pleading gesture toward Ethan, his face plastered with an ingratiating smile.

"Mr. Roscente, with your family's wealth, this petty cash must be nothing to you. But I'm broke—unemployed, living off my dad's measly $300,000 monthly allowance." He batted his eyelashes. "Cut me some slack. How about $260,000?"

His whining tone stretched like a spoiled puppy's.

Ethan didn't even glance up, taking a slow sip of his whiskey.

Gavin pouted.

The billion-dollar project would guarantee the Valentines massive profits.

$500,000 weekly expenses would total $7 million over three months.

"Ethan," he suddenly leaned in, "if you want to help Jenna, why not just give her the money? $7 million could set her and her brother up for life."

"Would you take it?" Ethan flicked cigarette ash.

"Damn right I would!"

"She's not you." A smoke ring drifted between them. "She'd refuse."

Gavin clawed at his hair. "But this way Tristan pockets everything! It's infuriating!"

Amid the haze, Ethan stubbed out his cigarette.

"I don't need your help anymore."

"Found another way?" Gavin's eyes lit up.

"Mhm."

"About the Hudson Yards project..." Gavin rubbed his hands.

Ethan swirled his glass. "HM Group's opening public bids. Tell your father to follow procedure."

Gavin's grin froze.

"However—" Ethan's tone shifted, "I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself."

"Name it!"

"Bring men to Studio 54 every night." Ethan's gaze turned glacial. "Guard Jenna. Keep the trash away."

Gavin gaped. "You actually like her?"

Ethan's stare could frost hell. "One more word, and Hudson Yards disappears."

Like her?

Ridiculous.

This was simply...atonement.
###Chapter 130

Gavin Valentine arched an eyebrow. "Fine, have it your way. I'll agree to your last condition."

He smirked inwardly. Ethan Roscente was such a hypocrite—clearly smitten with Jenna Roland yet refusing to admit it.

...

Studio 54 buzzed with its usual Friday night energy.

Jenna worked nonstop until 3 AM before finally catching her breath.

She hadn't even noticed when Ethan and Gavin left.

In the locker room, Jenna changed out of her uniform and bid Stella Laurent a quick goodbye before hurrying out.

The night air carried a chill as she scanned the street.

The familiar black Volkswagen Passat was nowhere in sight.

But she knew better. Her stalker was likely lurking in the shadows.

A taxi pulled up.

Jenna instructed the driver to take a detour.

Sure enough, the black sedan appeared in the rearview mirror, tailing them like a phantom.

The dim interior revealed only the silhouette of a driver in a black baseball cap.

Jenna clenched her fists.

Who was following her?

Someone sent by Sophia Merouin?

"Pull over here, please," she suddenly said.

The moment the taxi stopped, the trailing car halted too.

Jenna tried enlisting the driver's help, but fear held him back.

Considering the stalker might be armed, she settled for memorizing the license plate and directed the cab to the police station.

The black sedan maintained its distance the entire way, only peeling off when they reached the precinct.

"Where to now, miss?" the driver asked.

Jenna stared at the retreating taillights. "Wait a moment longer."

Once certain the coast was clear, she gave her Beverly Hills address.

"Look, I'd help if I could," the driver sighed. "But I've got a family to think about. You should file a report—a young woman like you can't be too careful."

Jenna nodded understandingly and stayed silent.

...

A shrill ringtone yanked Jenna from sleep.

Blinking groggily, she fumbled for her phone. Tony Lombardi's name flashed onscreen.

"Tony?" Her voice was thick with sleep.

"Still in bed?" His tone held exasperation.

"Mmm... What's up?"

"We agreed you'd bring Milo for lunch today. Just making sure you didn't forget."

Jenna bolted upright.

"Oh God! It completely slipped my mind!" She raked fingers through tangled hair. "Text me the address—we'll leave right away."

The location pinged through moments after they hung up.
###Chapter 131

Jenna emerged from her bedroom dressed and found Milo curled up on the couch watching TV.

"Sis, you stayed up so late last night. Why are you up so early?" Milo looked up in surprise.

She sat beside him and recounted everything about recognizing a gang leader as her sworn brother at the club.

"He invited us to lunch at his place today," she added.

Milo's brows knitted together. "Is he genuinely treating you as a sister or does he have ulterior motives?"

That club was a shady place, and he couldn't help feeling uneasy.

"He's from the underworld." Jenna chuckled. "At first I thought he was bad news too, but he's actually been really kind to me. That night he not only gave me money for late-night snacks but also ordered the most expensive liquor in the club."

"What?" Milo nearly jumped up. "Underworld? Are you insane?"

"Don't judge by appearances." Jenna glared. "He's been genuinely good to me."

"You just said he seemed shady!" Milo scoffed. "Talk about double standards."

She rolled her eyes. "I trust him. Are you coming or not?"

"I'm still worried he might have bad intentions."

"Oh, by the way, his wife is pregnant and currently on bed rest."

"...Fine." Milo reluctantly nodded.

Jenna's lips twitched. "Unbelievable. I'm going to wash up."

After finishing her makeup, they took a cab straight to the Malibu Beach House.

During the ride, Jenna first called Ethan. "Mr. Roscente, my brother and I are going out for lunch today. Please arrange your own meal."

"Mmm." The icy response came through before the line went dead.

She rubbed her arms. Ethan had always been like this—she should be used to it by now.

Next, she dialed Officer Hill. "Officer Hill, could you help me check a license plate number?"

"Why do you need that?" His tone turned stern.

Jenna tightened her grip on her phone. She knew the request was presumptuous, but for safety's sake, she had to verify this gang leader's identity.
###Chapter 132

Jenna quickly pressed send, forwarding the license plate number to Officer Hill.

"Officer Hill said he'll look into it." She pocketed her phone, brows slightly furrowed.

Milo grabbed her wrist. "Jenna, what's going on?"

"A car's been following me since last week." She pulled her hand free. "Twice now. I only lost them by driving to the police station."

Milo's face paled. "Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

"What could you have done?" Jenna glanced at her younger brother's slender frame.

"I could've picked you up!" His voice rose an octave.

Jenna shook her head. "You have classes."

"That doesn't mean you should take risks alone!" Milo clenched his fists. "What good will a license plate number do?"

"At least we'll know who's behind this." Her eyes turned icy. "I bet Sophia's involved."

"Sophia?" Milo looked confused.

Jenna gave him a quick rundown of their feud.

"That witch!" Milo kicked the tire in frustration. "Why can't she fight fair?"

"If she had the guts for a direct confrontation, things would be simpler." Jenna smirked.

An hour later, their taxi stopped at a Malibu beach house.

Milo gaped at the ornate wrought-iron gates. "Damn, sis. Your brother-in-law must be loaded."

Jenna pressed the doorbell. "Behave yourself inside."

A kindly housekeeper answered. "Miss Roland?" Nanny Florence ushered them in. "The master has been expecting you."

The living room was spacious enough for badminton. Crystal chandeliers dazzled overhead.

Milo sank into the buttery leather couch, whispering, "This place costs a fortune..."

"Study hard and you might afford it someday." Jenna flicked his forehead.

Rubbing his head, Milo grinned. "Books won't cut it. I need to go into business!"

"You'll need startup capital first." Jenna glanced around when footsteps echoed from the staircase.
###Chapter 133

Milo shrugged, a hint of resignation flashing in his eyes.

"Hard work can't compete with being born lucky. These days, luck matters more than education when it comes to getting rich."

He thought of Ethan Roscente's example. Without that stroke of luck, even with all his talent, Ethan would never have become the head of HM Group.

Jenna chuckled and patted her brother's shoulder.

"You're right. But luck alone isn't enough to keep you standing. You need both luck and skill."

Milo dodged her hand, a smirk playing on his lips.

"Don't worry, sis. I won't let you down."

"Good." Jenna blinked. "Our future mansion depends on you."

Just then, Nanny Florence ushered in Tony Lombardi and his wife Wendy.

The siblings quickly stood to greet them.

Tony beamed, none of his usual sharpness present.

"Wendy, this is Jenna Roland, the sister I just adopted. And this is her brother Milo."

Wendy studied Jenna with gentle eyes.

"Hello, I'm Wendy Lombardi, Tony's wife. You can call me sis."

Jenna was surprised. She'd expected disdain given her background.

Instead, Wendy seemed genuinely warm, even eager to bridge the gap.

"Hello, sis." Jenna gave a slight bow.

Wendy's gaze shifted to Milo, admiration flickering in her eyes.

"You two are so good-looking. Your parents must be stunning."

"They're alright." Jenna said modestly.

Wendy waved a hand. "Let's not stand on ceremony."

She turned to Nanny Florence. "Go prepare lunch."

The nanny nodded and withdrew.

Wendy smiled apologetically. "I wanted to cook myself, but I'm not feeling well today. I'll make it up to you next time."

"Don't trouble yourself, sis. Health comes first." Jenna said considerately.

Suddenly, she suggested, "How about I cook instead?"

Wendy raised an eyebrow. "You can cook?"

Milo interjected proudly, "My sister's an amazing cook."

"Then we're in for a treat today." Wendy rose with a smile. "Let me show you the kitchen."

Jenna quickly protested, "You should rest. I can find my way."

"It's just a few steps." Wendy insisted, leading the way.

The two women disappeared into the kitchen.

Watching them go, Tony's heart suddenly leaped into his throat.

......

In the kitchen, Wendy instructed Nanny Florence, "Let Jenna take charge. You assist her."

The nanny bowed respectfully.

Wendy added, "Tell her what dishes to make."

With everything arranged, Jenna picked up a chef's knife and began expertly handling the ingredients.
###Chapter 134

Jenna Roland assumed Wendy Lombardi would leave after questioning her. But the woman remained rooted behind her.

Wendy had claimed pregnancy nausea made her sensitive to cooking smells. Yet she lingered in the kitchen now.

Jenna's grip tightened around the chef's knife.

The blade struck the cutting board in rhythmic thuds.

"Jenna, does your brother frequent Studio 54 often?" Wendy's voice came from behind.

The knife stilled.

Here it comes.

She resumed dicing bell peppers without turning. "I've only worked there two weeks. Saw him twice - first when he claimed me as his sister, then last night's dinner invite."

Wendy chuckled. "Don't overthink it. I just worry about him. Hot-tempered men need watching."

Jenna's lips twitched.

Pathetic excuse.

Tony Lombardi was famously henpecked at home.

"Brother does have a short fuse. You should keep him in check." Jenna turned with an angelic smile.

"Naturally." Wendy stepped closer. "Does he bring company to the club?"

Jenna set down the knife and faced her directly.

"Never seen him with anyone."

Their gazes locked in silent combat.

Wendy narrowed her eyes, searching for cracks in Jenna's composure.

The younger woman's expression remained guileless.

"Since you call me sister-in-law, we're family." Wendy suddenly beamed. "If he steps out of line, you'll tell me."

"Of course." Jenna nodded sweetly.

Her back was damp with cold sweat.

Thank God Tony had warned her beforehand.

Wendy gave her a lingering look before exiting.

The kitchen door clicked shut. Jenna exhaled sharply.

She picked up the knife again. The bell peppers lay in mangled ruins.
###Chapter 135

Wendy Lombardi lounged lazily on the leather sofa, her slender legs crossed. Her diamond-studded pink manicure glittered under the lights.

Tony Lombardi hurried over with an exquisite bone china bowl filled with freshly made tremella soup. "Sweetheart, drink it while it's hot." He offered it carefully, his face plastered with an ingratiating smile.

Milo Roland stood nearby, his eyes wide. This usually imposing tough guy now resembled a fawning puppy.

"The kitchen's full of fumes. You shouldn't go there while pregnant." Tony's rough hands gently massaged Wendy's calves.

Wendy's red lips curved slightly. "I was just chatting with Jenna in the kitchen."

Tony's hands froze. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead.

"Tony Lombardi." Wendy's gaze turned icy. "You know my rules. If I find another woman around you..." Her fingertip traced his Adam's apple. "I'll make her disappear without a trace."

Milo sucked in a sharp breath. This woman was as beautiful as a rose—with equally deadly thorns.

"I swear on my life!" Tony raised three fingers. "You're the only one I'll ever love!" He discreetly wiped his sweat, silently grateful Jenna had kept her mouth shut.

Wendy shoved the empty bowl back into Tony's hands. "Get Milo a bowl too."

"No need, sis—" Milo waved his hands hastily.

"Summer heat causes inflammation." Wendy's eyes gleamed. "Tremella nourishes the lungs."

Tony fled to the kitchen like a pardoned convict. He patted his chest in relief—thank God he'd warned Jenna beforehand, or he'd be skinned alive today.

Aromatic scents wafted from the dining room. Jenna removed her apron and called out, "Tony, Wendy, dinner's ready."

"So soon?" Wendy arched a brow.

"Nanny Florence helped me." Jenna smiled, pulling out a chair.

Wendy rose gracefully, her skirt swishing in a perfect arc. "Then I must taste it properly." Her stilettos clicked sharply against the floor as she strode toward the dining room.
###Chapter 136

Tony Lombardi and Milo Roland followed closely behind as they headed to the dining room.

Wendy Lombardi and Tony froze when they saw the lavish spread on the table.

Wendy's eyes widened in disbelief. "Jenna, did you make all this by yourself?"

Jenna Roland smiled softly. "Yes, sis. Go ahead and try it. Let me know what you think."

Tony and Wendy exchanged glances, stunned by Jenna's culinary skills.

Every dish was beautifully presented, with mouthwatering aromas that rivaled a professional chef's work.

Wendy eagerly took her seat, accepting the chopsticks Tony handed her. She picked up a piece of braised fish.

The moment the fish touched her tongue, her eyes lit up. "Oh my God, this is incredible!"

Jenna blushed. "If you like it, I can come cook for you more often."

"That's a promise!" Wendy beamed. "If you don't show up, I'll have your brother pester you every day."

Jenna nodded. "Deal."

The table was laden with delicacies—steamed sea bass, sweet and sour ribs, and Milo's favorite cola chicken wings.

The meal was a joyous occasion. Even Wendy, who usually only ate one bowl of rice, went for seconds.

Tony devoured three full bowls, leaving Nanny Florence speechless.

The housekeeper marveled silently. In all her years of service, she'd never seen the family enjoy a meal this much.

After dinner, Wendy went upstairs and returned with two thick red envelopes.

She handed one to Jenna and the other to Milo. "This is a little something from your brother and me for your first visit."

Jenna immediately protested. "Sis, we can't accept this."

Tony frowned. "What, do you not consider us family?"

Milo shook his head. "Bro, sis, we appreciate the gesture, but we really can't take this."

Tony's expression darkened. "If you refuse again, I'll be offended."

The envelopes were visibly stuffed with cash.

Jenna and Milo exchanged glances, torn between gratitude and discomfort.
###Chapter 137

Jenna Roland clutched the thick red envelope, its weight heavy against her fingertips.

It was the first time since their parents' death that someone had given them a gift like this.

Tony Lombardi and Wendy Lombardi's gesture made Jenna's eyes grow slightly moist.

"Tony, we really can't accept this." Jenna pushed the envelope back. "You've already helped us so much."

She thought of the $20,000 transfer and last night's bottle of Romanée-Conti.

Tony frowned. "It's tradition for first-time guests."

Wendy laughed and tucked the envelope into Jenna's hand. "Consider it a welcome gift. No arguments."

Milo Roland discreetly squeezed the envelope, its thickness making his pulse quicken.

"Thank you, Tony. Thank you, Wendy." The boy lowered his head shyly.

Tony suddenly pulled a gold-embossed business card from the coffee table drawer.

"Take this." He handed it to Milo. "If anyone gives you trouble, call this number."

Milo accepted the card, his fingers trembling slightly.

He understood the power this card represented.

"Jenna, you should rest." Tony turned to her. "You have work tonight."

Jenna hesitated, glancing at Wendy. "Wendy... you don't mind that I work at the club?"

Wendy burst out laughing. "I was wilder than you at your age."

She linked arms with Jenna affectionately. "There's no shame in earning an honest living."

Jenna finally relaxed into a smile.

Watching her brother carefully tuck away the business card, she felt a long-lost sense of security.

For the first time in years, they weren't alone in this world anymore.
###Chapter 138

Jenna's instincts told her there was more to the story.

The corner of Jenna's lips curled into a faint smile. "Alright, then. Wendy, Tony, it's getting late. We should head out."

"Be careful on your way home," Wendy said, turning to Tony. "See them out, will you?"

"Of course." Tony stood and escorted Jenna and Milo to the door.

Standing on the villa's front steps, Tony asked, "How did you get here? Did you drive?"

"We took a cab," Jenna replied, pulling her coat tighter.

Tony immediately called his driver.

Within ten minutes, Charlie arrived with the car.

Tony watched until the siblings were safely inside before returning indoors.

The moment Jenna stepped into her apartment, her phone rang.

"Did you make it home?" Tony's voice came through the receiver.

"Just got in." Jenna collapsed onto the couch, exhaustion washing over her. She stifled a yawn.

"Tired?" Tony caught the sound instantly.

"A little." She rubbed her eyes. "You didn't call just to check if I got home, did you?"

A low chuckle sounded on the other end. "You know me too well. I wanted to ask—what did Wendy talk to you about in the kitchen?"

Jenna's gaze sharpened. Just as she'd suspected.

"She asked if there were other women in your life." Jenna didn't mince words.

"What did you say?" Tony's tone grew tense.

"I said no." Her voice turned icy. "Tony, Wendy treats you so well, and she's pregnant. You shouldn't be messing around. Do you have any idea how devastated she'd be if she found out?"

Silence stretched between them.

"I understand," Tony finally said. "I promise I won't betray her trust again."

"Remember your words." Jenna emphasized each syllable. "Don't agree with me now only to go running back to Fiona Valrose."

"Don't worry. Get some rest. Goodnight."

She hung up and went straight to bed.

When she woke, it was already 4 PM.

Since starting at Studio 54, her sleep schedule had shifted dramatically. Back at her uncle's place, six hours had been enough. Now she needed at least eight, or she'd feel groggy all day.

Yawning, Jenna stepped out of her room to find Milo counting red envelopes on the couch.

"How much?" she asked with a smile.

His eyes sparkled. "Twelve grand! They're really generous."

Remembering how Tony splurged at the club, Jenna scoffed. "He's got money to burn, that's for sure."
###Chapter 139

A bitter smile tugged at Ethan Roscente's lips.

He should have known.

In her heart, he would never measure up to Miles Valentine. Now, he couldn't even compare to a mere maid.

What was he still hoping for?

Time and again, the truth stared him in the face—he meant nothing to her.

Why humiliate himself further?

"Ethan—" Jenna Roland moved to follow him.

Liam Hill grabbed her arm. "Princess! The Duke's injuries need tending!"

"He smells of Chloe's medicine!" Jenna's eyes burned. "Chloe's missing!"

Liam remained level-headed. "The Duke wouldn't harm Chloe."

"How can you be so sure?"

"Princess," Liam sighed, "you're being reckless tonight."

Jenna sheathed her sword.

She had lost control.

Now, clarity returned—Ethan would never hurt Chloe.

But that faint medicinal scent didn't lie.

They'd crossed paths.

"I'm finding her." Jenna turned toward the exit.

Liam stepped forward.

"Pack our things," she ordered without looking back. "Be ready to leave."

If Chloe had truly gone to assassinate Sophia or Vanessa...

Attempting to kill a royal heir meant execution in Nanjin Palace.

She had to prepare for the worst.

Ethan's chambers.

Nathan Watson set down the medical kit. "Your Grace—"

"Send Zachary to locate that maid."

"Chloe's really vanished?"

"She wounded Vanessa's attendant and disappeared." Ethan clenched his fists. "Prepare to depart. If she's in danger, we break her out and leave immediately."

Nathan paled. "Your Grace would storm the dungeons?"

For a maid? Abandoning everything in Nanjin?

Even forsaking the Duchess?
###Chapter 140

Jenna Roland gripped her phone, her knuckles turning white.

Officer Liam Hill's words made her heart race.

Sophia Merouin was actually involved with that kind of person?

She took a deep breath and quickly scrolled through Stella Laurent's social media.

The group photo surfaced almost immediately.

In the picture, Sophia was beaming, showing no signs of association with underworld thugs.

"Officer Hill, the one on the right is Sophia Merouin."

After sending the message, Jenna mechanically ate her noodles.

Each bite tasted like cardboard.

While washing dishes, her phone remained silent.

Police work was indeed demanding.

Before leaving, Milo Roland gave her a concerned look.

"Jenna, you don't look well."

"Just tired, probably."

The wind outside Studio 54 was chilly.

Liam's call came abruptly.

"It's her." His voice was firm. "Byron Valdemar runs an auto shop now but still has ties to the underworld."

A cold sweat broke out on Jenna's back.

That stalker...

"You didn't see his face?"

"It was too dark."

"Try to get a photo. If it's Byron, call the police immediately."

The moment the call ended, Tristan Ashcroft appeared in her line of sight.

"Why are you standing outside?"

"Just got off the phone." Jenna hesitated. "Tristan, do you know Sophia Merouin well?"

His expression froze.

"Why the sudden question?"

Jenna explained everything.

Tristan's face darkened with each word.

"You were stalked?" His voice sharpened. "Are you hurt?"

"I lost him at the police station."

His shoulders relaxed slightly, but his gaze remained razor-sharp.

This was someone Ethan Roscente had personally entrusted to him.

Nothing could happen to her.
###Chapter 141

Tristan Ashcroft crossed his arms, his sharp gaze fixed on Jenna Roland. "Did you get a good look at who was following you?"

Jenna shook her head. "It was too dark. I couldn't see their face."

"I'll look into it," Tristan said grimly. "Be careful. If it happens again, call me immediately."

"But they were in a car. Will your people get there in time?"

"Just stall them," Tristan explained. "Call me with your location. My team will handle the rest."

Jenna nodded.

Tristan pulled out his phone and dialed Sophia Merouin without hesitation.

The call connected quickly.

"Sophia, did you send someone to follow Jenna?" Tristan's voice was ice-cold.

Jenna's heart skipped a beat.

She hadn't expected Tristan to confront Sophia directly. They'd already had a falling out—Sophia had quit long ago.

"Jenna told you?" Sophia's voice dripped with venomous hatred.

"Answer the question," Tristan demanded, his tone even colder.

Sophia scoffed. "Go ahead and call the police. What can you do without proof?"

"So it was you."

Suddenly, Sophia shifted tactics. "You care about her that much? Do you like her?"

Tristan ended the call abruptly.

"It's Sophia," he said, turning back to Jenna.

The police had traced the license plate to Byron Valdemar—Sophia's boyfriend.

After a moment of silence, Jenna decided to come clean.

"Boss, there's something you need to know."

"Speak."

"When Sophia was with you, she was already dating Byron Valdemar. He owns an auto repair shop." Jenna met Tristan's eyes steadily. "The car that followed me belongs to him."

"What?!"

Tristan froze as if struck by lightning.

Jenna repeated herself.

Tristan's temples throbbed with rage. He remembered all the money he'd given Sophia—now he realized it had all gone straight into Byron's pockets!

That damn woman!

She'd been using his money to fund her affair?

Furious, Tristan dialed Sophia's number again.
###Chapter 142

The phone rang abruptly.

Sophia had just picked up a piece of salmon with her chopsticks when she saw the caller ID. The utensils clattered onto the table.

"Tristan Ashcroft?" She hesitated before answering.

"Sophia, you bitch!" Tristan's furious roar exploded through the receiver. "Is Byron your boyfriend? How fucking dare you lie to me?"

Her fingers turned ice-cold.

Instinctively, she glanced at Byron sitting across from her. He was calmly cutting his steak.

"I..." Her throat tightened.

Byron noticed her discomfort. "Who is it?" he asked.

The private dining room was eerily silent. Tristan clearly heard the male voice.

Sophia fumbled to end the call.

"It's over..." Her face paled. "Tristan knows about us."

Byron leisurely lit a cigarette.

Through the haze of smoke, he narrowed his eyes. "So what? What are you afraid of?"

She clenched the napkin in her fist.

The thought of Tristan's connections sent chills down her spine.

"You don't understand him..." Her voice trembled. "If he finds out we've been deceiving him all this time..."

Byron scoffed and flicked the ash from his cigarette.

"What can he do to you now?" He exhaled a smoke ring. "Remember, you're not working at his club anymore."

......

Outside Studio 54.

Jenna Roland took one look at Tristan's livid expression and her stomach dropped.

"Boss..." she ventured cautiously.

The veins on Tristan's hand bulged as he gripped his phone.

"That man was Byron Valdemar," he spat through gritted teeth. "I heard his voice."

Jenna stayed silent.

She watched as Tristan dialed another number.

"Zachary, find Sophia's address," Tristan's voice was glacial. "And dig up everything on that Byron Valdemar. I want every detail."

After hanging up, he turned to Jenna.

"Stay alert," he warned. "If you notice anyone following you, contact me immediately."

Jenna nodded vigorously. "Understood, boss."

A cold night breeze swept past, making her shiver involuntarily.
###Chapter 143

Jenna Roland pushed open the doors of Studio 54, her stilettos clicking sharply against the marble floor.

She had just finished a staff meeting and immediately dragged Stella Laurent into a secluded corner.

"I've got some piping hot tea to spill," Jenna whispered, her eyes gleaming with excitement.

Stella arched an eyebrow. "What's so juicy?"

"That bitch Sophia Merouin has been secretly dating some young hunk named Byron Valdemar behind Ethan's back!" Jenna hissed through gritted teeth.

"Holy shit!" Stella gasped, her manicured nails nearly digging into her palms.

Who would've thought the seemingly innocent Sophia was playing such dangerous games?

"Ethan's already investigating them," Jenna gloated, waving her phone. "Once he gets solid proof, those two are done for."

Stella nodded vigorously. "With Ethan's temper, he'll skin them alive."

"Shh—" Jenna suddenly glanced around warily. "This stays between us. If word gets out and embarrasses Ethan..."

"Got it." Stella mimed zipping her lips. "But speaking of which, all those limited-edition bags he gave her..."

Their gossip session was interrupted when the glass doors swung open. Gavin Valentine entered with two unfamiliar men, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders and narrow waist.

"Mr. Valentine." Jenna instantly switched to her professional smile. "Not joining Mr. Roscente today?"

Gavin smirked. "Miss him already?"

Jenna's smile froze.

"Just kidding." Gavin smoothly changed the subject, gesturing to his companions. "This is Xavier Lefèvre and Ronan Abendroth."

Both men gave curt nods. The one in the black shirt had well-defined muscles, while the gray T-shirt guy radiated an icy aura.

"Booth 309." Gavin flashed a black card between his fingers.

As Jenna led them upstairs, she couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. When she returned downstairs after delivering their drinks, she nearly collided with Tristan Ashcroft.

"Is Mr. Roscente here?" Tristan stopped her abruptly.
###Chapter 144

Jenna Roland shook her head lightly. "Only Mr. Valentine and his friend are here."

"Which private room?"

"309."

Tristan Ashcroft nodded and instructed Jenna to fetch the wine before heading straight to Room 309.

He pushed the door open to find Gavin Valentine lounging on the sofa, legs crossed. Spotting Tristan, Gavin grinned. "Boss Ashcroft, long time no see!"

Tristan took a seat beside him. "No need for formalities."

"Shouldn't I call you 'boss' in your own club?" Gavin swirled his wine glass.

Tristan chuckled. "Suit yourself."

Gavin's smile suddenly faded as he turned serious. "Mr. Roscente has instructed that all our expenses here go on his tab."

"I know. His assistant called this morning."

Gavin narrowed his eyes. "Miss Roland is Mr. Roscente's most cherished person. If anything happens to her here..."

"Most cherished?" Tristan frowned. "Are they together?"

Gavin smirked meaningfully. "That's unclear. But Mr. Roscente has been particularly attentive to her lately. You understand."

Tristan's gaze shifted to the two unfamiliar faces in the room. "And these gentlemen?"

"My bodyguards," Gavin said casually. "Here specifically to protect Miss Roland."

Tristan's heart skipped a beat. Sending bodyguards? Ethan Roscente must truly value Jenna.

Just then, Jenna entered with the wine.

The conversation in the room halted abruptly.

Gavin smoothly changed the subject. "Business has been good lately, Boss Ashcroft?"

"Not bad." But Tristan's eyes remained fixed on Jenna.

There was something undeniably special about her—not just her beauty, but her poised demeanor. No wonder even someone like Ethan Roscente treated her differently.

Jenna expertly poured the wine and raised her glass. "Mr. Valentine, Mr. Lefèvre, Mr. Abendroth, a toast to your enjoyment."

She downed the drink in one go, exchanged a few pleasantries, then turned to leave.
###Chapter 145

Saturday night pulsed with restless energy. The club throbbed with laughter and clinking glasses.

Jenna Roland navigated between private rooms in stiletto heels. Champagne flutes cast fractured light across her path.

By 3 AM, the last patrons finally departed.

She massaged her aching ankles, fingertips still carrying the rich aroma of red wine.

The dressing room mirror reflected her exhaustion. Smudged eyeliner framed her weary eyes.

"Stella, I'm heading out," she called toward the lounge.

Night air greeted her with the first chill of early autumn.

The taxi glided past neon-lit streets. In the rearview mirror, a black Volkswagen Passat maintained steady pursuit.

Her phone screen illuminated. Liam Hill's contact topped her recent calls list.

Her finger hovered momentarily before selecting Tristan Ashcroft's name instead.

"Boss, that car's back."

The clink of crystal echoed through the receiver. Tristan's voice carried a whiskey warmth. "Text me the plate number."

The driver studied her through the mirror. "Miss, should I call the police?"

"No." She tightened her grip on the phone. "Take Sunset Boulevard instead."

Park Avenue's flickering streetlights revealed the black sedan maintaining precise distance.

A sudden vibration. An unknown number flashed on her screen.

"Miss Roland, we're in position."

Two blinding headlights appeared in the rearview, boxing in the Volkswagen.
###Chapter 146

"Six men, all armed." The voice on the phone was low and grim.

"Understood." Jenna Roland's reply was clipped.

She turned to the driver. "Pull over at the park up ahead."

The driver's grip on the wheel tightened. "Pay the fare first. I'm leaving the moment you step out."

"Fine."

Jenna understood his caution. These days, no one wanted trouble.

The taxi screeched to a halt at the park entrance.

The moment Jenna's feet touched the pavement, the cab sped away, its taillights painting red streaks in the darkness.

Within a minute, a black Volkswagen Passat rolled to a stop before her.

Jenna's hand slid into her bag, fingers closing around the pepper spray.

The door opened. A tall man in a baseball cap emerged. Beneath the brim, his eyes glinted with malice.

Two more men climbed out from the backseat—one with a buzz cut, the other with bleached hair and grotesque tattoos snaking down his arms.

Then came a woman.

Jenna's pupils contracted.

Sophia Merouin.

So she was behind the stalking.

"Long time no see, Jenna." Sophia sauntered forward in stilettos, crimson lips curling into a sneer.

Just then, two SUVs roared onto the scene.

Six hulking men swiftly surrounded Sophia's group.

Her face paled. "You set me up?"

Jenna brandished the pepper spray with a cold smile. "Did you really think I'd come alone?"

Realization dawned on Sophia. Her expression turned ashen.

The bleached-haired thug foolishly spat, "Back off if you know what's good for you!"

Without hesitation, Ryan Casstevensa drew his gun and fired at the man's thigh.

BANG!

The gunshot shattered the night.

The thug crumpled, howling as he clutched his leg.

The buzz-cut man barely twitched before another bullet tore through his kneecap.

Sophia stumbled back in terror, her heels twisting as she fell hard onto the pavement.

Ryan's 6'3" frame loomed like an iron tower, wisps of smoke curling from his gun barrel.
###Chapter 147

Jenna Roland's pupils constricted sharply.

Six pitch-black handguns were trained on her in unison, their metallic surfaces glinting coldly under the streetlights.

Tristan Ashcroft's men actually carried firearms—a serious felony in this country.

Ryan Casstevensa's gaze was razor-sharp as it pinned Sophia Merouin. "Was trailing Miss Roland your idea?"

Sophia's face turned ashen, her lips trembling. "N-no... It wasn't me..."

"She ordered it!" Jenna stated with absolute conviction.

Sophia shuddered violently, nearly collapsing to the ground.

She let out a hysterical scream. "Jenna! What good would my death do you?"

"Plenty." Jenna's laugh was icy. "At least no one would stalk me anymore. But—" Her tone shifted abruptly, "Murder's illegal. I won't let you die."

Though she loathed Sophia, she wouldn't go so far as to take a life.

Ryan exchanged a glance with Xavier Lefèvre. "Tie them up."

Xavier swiftly holstered his gun and retrieved ropes from the trunk.

Within moments, Sophia and her two accomplices were bound tightly.

"This is kidnapping!" Sophia thrashed wildly. "I'll call the police!"

Jenna scoffed. "Now you care about the law? Did you consider consequences when having me followed?"

Venomous hatred flashed in Sophia's eyes.

This bitch had cost her everything—her wealthy patron, her status, everything!

"Take them away," Ryan commanded.

Jenna stopped him. "Where are you taking them?"

"The boss wants to see them." Ryan lowered his voice. "Tristan Ashcroft."

Understanding dawned on Jenna.

Sophia had been two-timing Tristan and Byron Valdemar, even using her patron's money to fund her side piece.

What man would tolerate such humiliation?

"I'll drive you back." Ryan opened the car door.

Jenna gave the name of a Beverly Hills neighborhood, keeping her voice deliberately soft.

The black sedan glided soundlessly into the night.
###Chapter 148

Dawn's first light filtered through the curtains as Tristan Ashcroft awoke.

Cold water droplets traced the sharp angles of his face in the bathroom mirror.

His white robe hung loosely, revealing a sculpted chest beneath.

In the living room, he dialed Ryan Casstevensa's number.

"Did you find them?"

"Boss, Sophia and the others are already at the ranch."

Tristan ended the call, his black dress shirt accentuating his broad shoulders and narrow waist.

Butler Raymond approached with a coffee tray. "Young master, breakfast is—"

"Not needed."

The black Bugatti sliced through the morning light like a blade.

Deseret Ranch sprawled across the outskirts, purchased by Tristan for a staggering sum three years prior.

Tall walls shielded the property from prying eyes, creating an oasis of silence.

Gravel crunched beneath tires, startling sparrows pecking at the ground.

By the wooden cabin, Ryan trimmed roses with a cigarette dangling from his lips.

"Boss."

The interior fell silent as men snapped to attention.

Tristan's gaze swept across them. "Lead the way."

Behind the chicken coop, a hidden cellar door exhaled damp mildew into the morning air.

In the dim glow, Sophia Merouin shivered in a bound chair.

"Boss!" Her voice cracked. "I can explain—"

Tristan seized her chin. "Using my money to fund your lover?"

Kevin Heilbronn struggled against his restraints until Xavier Lefèvre's boot sent him sprawling.

"How long did you think you could hide Byron's involvement?"

Sophia's nails bit into her palms, her face bloodless.

Releasing her, Tristan methodically wiped his fingers with a handkerchief.

"I despise betrayal." His eyes glinted like frost in moonlight as he turned. "Especially from greedy little vipers."

The cellar door slammed shut, swallowing Sophia's sobs.
###Chapter 149

Sophia Merouin was tied to a chair, her face swollen and bruised. Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth. She looked up at Tristan Ashcroft with bloodshot eyes filled with terror.

"Boss, I've been loyal to you all these years!" Her voice trembled as tears streamed down her cheeks. "I swear, if I'm lying, may I die a horrible death!"

Tristan stood before her, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit. His gaze was icy cold. Slowly, he removed his Patek Philippe watch and handed it to Ryan Casstevensa.

"We've checked everything." His voice was soft, yet it made Sophia shiver. "Jenna Roland talked."

Ryan wordlessly untied the ropes binding Sophia. The moment she was free, she collapsed to her knees and clung to Tristan's leg.

"Boss!" she wailed. "After all these years of serving you, don't I deserve some mercy?"

Tristan looked down at her, a cold smirk curling his lips. He kicked her away without hesitation.

"Do it." His order was brief.

Leon Massies and Ronan Abendroth stepped forward. Sophia screamed and tried to scramble away, but Leon yanked her back by the hair. Fists rained down on her until her face was unrecognizable.

Kevin Heilbronn stood in the corner, his face pale. He watched as Sophia coughed up blood, his legs shaking uncontrollably.

"Mr. Ashcroft!" he suddenly shouted. "Sophia and Byron Valdemar have been together for eight years! She used your money to buy him a car and open a shop! They were the ones who ordered Jenna to be followed!"

Sophia's head snapped up, blood obscuring her stunned expression. She glared at Kevin with pure hatred.

"You—" she spat through gritted teeth. "Byron treated you like a brother!"

Kevin flinched, his voice trembling. "I... I'm just telling the truth..."

Tristan's eyes darkened. He walked slowly toward Sophia and stepped on her fingers with his leather shoe.

Sophia let out a piercing scream.

"Cut off her thumb." Tristan's voice was eerily calm. "Then break her legs."

Sophia shook her head frantically, dragging herself backward. "No! Boss, I was wrong! I'll do anything!"

Tristan turned and walked toward the exit without looking back. "Do it."

Ryan pulled a gleaming dagger from his suit pocket and advanced on Sophia. Her screams echoed through the empty warehouse, like a dying animal caught in a trap.
###Chapter 150

Tristan Ashcroft's gaze was like a poisoned ice blade, piercing straight into Kevin Heilbronn's soul. "After successfully tailing Jenna Roland, what were your plans for her?"

Kevin's legs trembled. Cold sweat beaded on his forehead. His eyes darted to Sophia Merouin, curled up in the corner, before his Adam's apple bobbed. "They... they wanted me to assault Ms. Roland first, then let Byron Valdemar's men take turns... take turns defiling her. They wanted to turn her into—"

"Into what?" Tristan's voice sharpened.

"A... a whore..." Kevin's whisper was barely audible.

Sophia's head snapped up, her eyes blazing with venomous fury. "Kevin! Say one more word, and I'll have Byron wipe out your entire family!"

"Ah—!"

A bloodcurdling scream tore through the basement. A flash of steel, and Sophia's thumb hit the floor with a sickening thud.

Blood sprayed across the concrete, stark and horrifying.

Ronan Abendroth swung a metal chair with chilling precision, smashing it into Sophia's left leg.

The crack of shattering bone echoed in the confined space.

Sophia's screams cut off abruptly as she collapsed like a broken doll.

"Boss, she's out," Ronan reported tonelessly.

Tristan didn't even glance at Sophia as he stalked toward Kevin. "Throw her out."

Two men in black dragged Sophia away like a sack of garbage.

"Tell Byron this." Tristan gripped Kevin's jaw, forcing eye contact. "Every cent Sophia ever spent on him will be in my hands within three days. Otherwise—" His fingers dug in. "I'll teach him the meaning of living hell."

Kevin trembled violently, nodding like a puppet. "Message received! Message received!"

Tristan paused at the door. "If anyone touches Jenna again..." He turned, baring his teeth in a predator's grin. "Sophia's fate will seem merciful."

Only when the basement door clanged shut did Kevin crumple to the floor. His shirt clung to his back, drenched in sweat.

Staring at the darkening bloodstain, he suddenly laughed. "Byron... you've signed your own death warrant."

Of all people to cross, he had to provoke the devil himself.

......

Jenna was plating sweet-and-sour ribs when her phone buzzed in her apron pocket.

"Boss?" She wiped her hands hastily.

"Kevin Heilbronn was tailing you," came Tristan's voice, still edged with violence. "Sophia and Byron's orders. But—" A deliberate pause. "They won't get another chance."

Jenna's grip tightened on the phone.

"If Sophia dares try anything..." Tristan's chuckle sent chills down her spine. "I'll make her regret being born."
###Chapter 151

Jenna's hand trembled slightly as she clutched her phone.

The moment the kitchen door closed, she lowered her voice. "Boss, what did you do to Sophia?"

"Nothing much." Tristan Ashcroft's tone was eerily light. "Just chopped off one of her fingers and broke her leg."

Jenna's vision darkened. She nearly lost her balance.

Sophia had lost a finger? And her leg was broken?

She sucked in a sharp breath. Tristan was even more ruthless than she'd imagined.

But then again, Sophia deserved it. How dare she use Tristan's money to support her young lover? She was practically begging for death.

"Is she... still alive?" Jenna's voice tightened.

"Dead?" Tristan let out a cold laugh. "Trash like her doesn't get to die that easily."

A chill ran down Jenna's spine. His voice was like ice.

Now she truly understood the terrifying consequences of crossing someone like him.

After hanging up, Jenna leaned against the wall to steady herself.

She needed to save up enough money and leave this place as soon as possible. Otherwise, she might be the next one to suffer.

Taking a deep breath, Jenna carried the dishes out of the kitchen.

"Milo, Mr. Roscente, dinner's ready." She forced herself to sound calm.

Ethan glanced at the simple home-cooked meal, his brow lifting slightly.

Though the dishes were ordinary, they inexplicably whetted his appetite.

Milo silently handed him a bowl of rice.

The dining table was so quiet that only the clinking of utensils could be heard.

Midway through the meal, Ethan suddenly spoke. "I know a surgeon."

Both siblings looked up.

"Liam Melford," Ethan said casually. "When you've saved enough, he can perform the surgery."

Jenna's hand jerked, nearly dropping her chopsticks.

Liam Melford? The medical prodigy?

She'd researched him before. His waiting list stretched six months long, and the surgery fees were astronomical.

"You... know Dr. Melford?" Her voice shook.

Ethan gave a nonchalant nod. "A colleague of mine is close with him."

Jenna's heart raced. This might be Milo's only chance at survival.
###Chapter 152

Jenna Roland stared at her phone screen, fingers trembling slightly. The profile displayed Dr. Liam Melford, head of neurosurgery at Mayo Clinic—one of the nation's top brain specialists with a staggering 98% surgical success rate.

She bit her lower lip, gaze lingering on that astonishing number. If only they could get Dr. Melford to operate on Milo...

"Lost in thought?"

Ethan Roscente's voice startled her from behind, nearly making her drop the phone. She fumbled to lock the screen and turned to meet his penetrating gaze.

"N-nothing." Her fingers twisted the hem of her shirt.

Ethan glanced at her whitened knuckles before shifting his attention to the medical records on the coffee table. "Melford is indeed the best choice."

Jenna's head snapped up, hope flashing in her eyes before dimming just as quickly. "But Mayo's fees—"

"He lives next door to me," Ethan interrupted, rolling up his sleeves. "I can ask him to come to Los Angeles."

"Really?" Her voice quivered as her nails dug into her palms. "The...cost?"

"About fifty grand." His cufflinks clicked open. "Excluding equipment."

The number made her eyes burn. She turned away to wipe them hastily, forcing a smile when she faced him again. "Could you please arrange it? I'll save up as fast as I can."

Ethan gave a noncommittal hum and walked toward the dining area. Jenna hurried after him, darting ahead to clear the dishes.

"I've got this!"

Ignoring her, Ethan picked up a plate. His hands were lean and strong, tendons visible beneath pale skin. When their fingers brushed accidentally, she recoiled like she'd been burned.

"S-sorry."

Water rushed from the faucet. Jenna stole glances at the man beside her. His rolled-up sleeves revealed corded forearms with veins tracing beneath the surface. His Adam's apple moved with each swallow, casting sharp shadows under the light.

"What would you like for dinner tomorrow?" She grasped for conversation.

"Whatever." He shook droplets from his hands, water sliding down his prominent wrist bones.

As she handed him a towel, her fingertips grazed his cool skin. She spun away too quickly to notice the dark flicker in his eyes.

Milo's laughter floated from the living room where Grandma Blanche was showing him photo albums, deliberately raising her voice. "Jenna dear, that kitchen's crowded enough!"
###Chapter 153

Jenna's gaze involuntarily dropped to Ethan's throat. The pronounced curve of his Adam's apple bobbed with each swallow, like an invisible hook tugging at her pulse.

She stole a glance at his rolled-up sleeves. Veins traced faint blue paths beneath his pale skin, hinting at restrained strength.

"Done staring?"

His icy voice doused her like a bucket of cold water.

Her hands jerked, nearly dropping the bowl. "N-nothing." She ducked her head, fingers slipping on the porcelain rim.

"How did you meet Grandma Blanche?" Ethan's sudden question startled her.

Her fingers stilled. So Blanche hadn't told him?

"I owned a fruit stand." She moistened her dry lips. "She became a regular. Eventually I started delivering to her."

Ethan's brow furrowed. That explained the sudden influx of fruit baskets at home.

"Why the career change?" His tone remained flat, eyes fixed elsewhere.

"Wasn't profitable." A bitter smile touched her lips. "Milo's medical bills... the club pays better."

Two sharp taps of his fingers on the countertop. "That place doesn't suit you."

Her eyes brightened. "Are you worried about me, Mr. Roscente?"

"You carry my name now." His voice could frost glass. "Your disgrace reflects on me."

Her smile froze. Of course.

"I'll leave once I've saved enough for his surgery." She resumed scrubbing dishes, letting running water mask her thickened voice.

"Hmm."

Ten minutes later, the kitchen stood empty. Drying her hands, she realized Ethan had vanished.

"Jenna!" Milo sidled up with a conspiratorial grin. "You two were in there forever—"

"Nothing happened." She snatched the remote, jabbing buttons randomly. "He's embarrassed by my job."

Milo frowned. "It does look bad. If clients recognize you—"

"I know." She tossed the remote back. "I'm napping. You handle dinner."

"What should I buy?"

"Whatever." She trudged toward the bedroom without turning, exhaustion weighing each step.
###Chapter 154

Jenna stretched her stiff limbs and dragged her exhausted body into the bedroom.

...

At noon the next day, Ethan pushed open the dining room door.

Mid-meal, he set down his fork abruptly. "A friend from the Red Cross is coming tomorrow to assess our situation."

Jenna's chopsticks froze mid-air.

"If approved, they may cover your brother's surgery expenses."

Her chopsticks clattered onto the plate. Wide-eyed, she whispered, "Really?"

Ethan dabbed his lips with a napkin. "Just provide accurate details about your family circumstances and his medical condition."

Her fingers trembled with emotion.

First securing Dr. Liam's expertise yesterday, now potential funding for the surgery.

She sprang up and placed the largest chicken leg on Ethan's plate with shaking hands. "Mr. Roscente, thank you so much!"

Her deep bow couldn't hide her glistening eyes and flushed nose.

Ethan frowned at the offering. "I don't eat chicken legs."

"My apologies!" She reached to retrieve it.

"Wait." His hand covered the plate. "Perhaps one bite."

Perched on her chair, Jenna watched intently as he took a tentative taste.

"It's marinated with my special sauce—"

The tender meat melted on his tongue, infused with rich spices.

He took another bite.

Jenna's face lit up.

This marked the first time Ethan had ever taken a second bite of something he supposedly disliked.

Mental note: Braised chicken legs—Ethan's unexpected favorite.
###Chapter 155

After dinner, Ethan Roscente helped Jenna Roland clear the table as usual.

His slender fingers picked up the dishes, stacking them with practiced ease.

"How about installing a dishwasher?" Ethan suddenly suggested.

He frowned at the pile of greasy plates in the sink, reminded of the mountain of paperwork at his office.

Jenna squeezed dish soap onto a sponge and shook her head. "It's just a few dishes. No need to waste money."

She remembered the price tag on the dishwasher she'd seen at the mall—equivalent to half a year's salary for her.

"Money isn't an issue," Ethan said flatly.

Jenna turned to him, her tone serious. "You just bought a house and a new car. You must be tight on cash. If you hate washing dishes, I'll handle it from now on."

Drying her hands, she flashed him a warm smile.

Ethan paused mid-motion.

This penthouse duplex had been reserved for him during the property development—it cost him nothing. As for the "new" car, it was merely the ninth vehicle in his garage.

The irony almost made him laugh.

"Mr. Roscente," Jenna said abruptly, her expression turning solemn. "You can stop transferring money to that account. If the Red Cross covers Milo's surgery, I can return the funds to you."

The plate nearly slipped from Ethan's grasp.

He remembered suspecting her of ulterior motives, yet here she was offering to help him.

"How much is in there?" His voice came out rough.

"About $25,000." Jenna counted on her fingers. "Do you need it?"

Ethan studied her clear, guileless eyes. "What if I borrowed all of it?"

"Of course," she agreed instantly. "But we should confirm Milo's medical expenses first. What do you need the money for?"

"An investment."

Jenna's eyes lit up. "Having ambition is wonderful! Once we hear from the Red Cross, the money's yours."

Ethan's expression darkened abruptly. "Aren't you afraid I'm scamming you?"

He stepped closer, his imposing frame casting a shadow over her.
###Chapter 156

Jenna Roland lifted her face, gazing earnestly at Ethan Roscente. "We're already married. If you lie to me, you'll be implicated too. Grandma Blanche said you're a decent man, just a bit cold. I don't think you'd deceive me."

Ethan's brows furrowed slightly. "What if I really did?"

Jenna pressed her lips together, thinking for a moment. "I know Officer Liam Hill. If you trick me, I'll call the police."

Ethan froze momentarily before chuckling lowly.

He rubbed his temples.

Her naivety was almost laughable.

If he were truly a con artist, what good would calling the police do?

Yet her sincerity inexplicably moved him.

Ethan picked up a towel to dry his hands, then turned to face Jenna. "Keep the money for yourself. Since you've run a fruit shop before, start a small business. For your brother's sake, you need to build a better life."

"Okay." Jenna nodded. "The dishes are done. You should head to work. I'll clean up the kitchen."

"Mm."

Without another word, Ethan walked away.

Exiting the residential area, he strode directly toward a black Audi parked by the curb.

Once inside, he dialed Justin Kemnis.

"Come to my place tomorrow at noon," Ethan said, his voice deep. "Only ask about her family background and her brother's condition. Don't pry into anything else."

"Jenna actually married you?" Justin's shock was palpable through the phone.

He still hadn't recovered from the news since hearing it yesterday.

"Yes." Ethan lit a cigarette and took a slow drag. "Not a word about my identity."

"You're hiding who you are to marry her?" Justin sounded incredulous. "With your status, you could easily wed some socialite. How could you—"

How could he choose Jenna?

Blame his grandparents for that.

If not for their threats and coercion, he'd never have married this ordinary woman.

Ethan had no interest in elaborating. "Just do as I say."

"Marrying Jenna... does that mean you've moved on from Yvonne Sherwood?"

Ethan's gaze turned icy. "You're talking too much."

Justin forced a dry laugh. "Understood. I won't mess this up."

After hanging up, Ethan texted his address to Justin.

Stubbing out the half-smoked cigarette, he started the engine and drove toward HM Group.
###Chapter 157

The twilight painted the sky with fiery hues as the sun dipped below the horizon.

Jenna Roland weaved through traffic on her e-bike, the wind tousling her hair. Gazing at the golden-orange afterglow, she hummed a cheerful tune.

Ethan Roscente's stern face surfaced in her mind. Who would've thought this seemingly cold man could be so kindhearted?

First, he arranged for Dr. Liam Melford to perform Milo's surgery. Then he secured aid from a charity foundation. She'd remember this debt of gratitude.

If Ethan was willing to make this marriage work, she'd cherish it with all her heart.

The neon lights of Studio 54 glowed brightly against the night sky.

"Hey, what's got you so happy?" Stella Laurent slung an arm around Jenna's shoulders, eyes sparkling.

"Better than finding treasure." Jenna winked mysteriously.

"Spill!" Stella pressed eagerly.

"Milo's surgery funds are settled." Jenna lowered her voice. "A charity foundation helped apply for Red Cross assistance."

Stella's eyes widened. "So he can get the operation soon?"

"Mm. And..." Jenna couldn't contain her excitement. "Ethan's colleague knows Dr. Melford."

"Liam Melford?" Stella looked blank.

"The cardiac surgery specialist at Mayo Clinic." Jenna gestured. "Online forums call him the 'Heart Whisperer.'"

Stella immediately pulled out her phone to search. Moments later, she gasped. "An expert of that caliber must have a year-long waiting list!"

"Let's wait for Red Cross approval first." Jenna waved a hand. "It's too early to celebrate."

"What about post-op care?" Stella frowned. "He'll need at least two weeks hospitalized."

"I'll take care of him." Jenna answered without hesitation.

"What about work? Anti-rejection meds aren't cheap."

Jenna bit her lip. "I'll stay for a week, then hire a nurse."

As they spoke, the club doors swung open. Gavin Valentine strode in, his tailored suit accentuating his long legs, gaze sharp as a blade.
###Chapter 158

Jenna Roland had just finished tidying the bar counter when she looked up to see three familiar figures push through the door.

Liam Ashcroft and Oliver Macmillan trailed behind Gavin Valentine as usual.

She froze for a split second before plastering on her professional smile. "Good evening, Mr. Valentine, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Macmillan."

Gavin arched an eyebrow. "Not happy to see us?"

"Of course not." She dipped her head slightly. "I just didn't expect to meet you again so soon."

Gavin chuckled. "Consider us bored rich kids with too much time. Tonight we want company—pick someone easy on the eyes."

"Understood." Jenna nodded. "Right this way."

She led them to the VIP lounge on the third floor.

After taking their drink orders, Jenna personally retrieved a bottle of premium red wine from the cellar.

When she returned, Gavin was idly spinning his empty glass on the table.

"Madam Chen will bring the girls shortly," Jenna explained.

Gavin motioned for her to sit. "Have a drink with us first."

Three rounds later, Jenna couldn't resist asking, "What brings you here for escorts tonight, Mr. Valentine?"

"Everyone needs entertainment." He swirled his wine, a glint of mischief in his eyes.

The door opened at that moment.

Madam Chen entered with four girls of contrasting styles.

"Mr. Valentine, these are our finest ladies," she simpered.

Gavin's gaze swept over them before pointing at the demurely dressed one. "Not her."

The other three immediately took seats beside the men.

As the girl in the sequined miniskirt settled next to Gavin, his arm slid around her waist with practiced ease.

Jenna rose discreetly. "I'll leave you to enjoy your evening."

Gavin waved her off without looking up, already engrossed in conversation with the girl in his arms.
###Chapter 159

Jenna Roland stepped into the grand hall, her high heels clicking against the marble floor. The crystal chandelier cast shimmering reflections across her figure.

A man at the bar tracked her every move with his gaze.

When she passed through the hall for the third time, his eyes still lingered on her.

The incident with Sophia Merouin had made her hyperaware of anything unusual.

Suddenly, the man pulled out a black object from his bag and tapped on it.

Jenna froze mid-step.

She started toward him, but he set down his glass and hurried away.

As the glass door swung shut, Jenna stopped.

"Brian," she turned to the bartender. "How long was that guy sitting here?"

Brian polished a glass. "The one in the black T-shirt? He's been here since Gavin Valentine went into the VIP room."

"What did he ask about?"

"He wanted to know how long you've worked here, whether Ethan Roscente visits..." Brian lowered his voice. "And if you were an escort girl."

Jenna's nails dug into her palms.

Not Sophia's people.

But why was he asking about Ethan?

As she turned, her eyes caught the surveillance camera. A thought struck her.

A black Mercedes idled in the alley behind the club.

Derek Linister made a call. "Ms. Galatea, I've sent you the photos."

"Did you get the information?" The woman's voice carried urgency.

"Ethan Roscente rarely comes, but Gavin Valentine is a regular. The woman just sells drinks."

Vanessa Galatea ended the call, her fingers gliding over the screen.

On the wicker table of her balcony, a black velvet box lay untouched.
###Chapter 160

Wendy set down her coffee cup and looked across at Vanessa. "Who was that?"

Vanessa placed her phone on the table. "Derek Linister."

"The private investigator?" Wendy arched an eyebrow. "Did he find anything?"

"Jenna is working as a beverage promoter at Studio 54." Vanessa tapped her screen lightly. "Ethan rarely goes there."

She quickly transferred twenty thousand to Derek and opened the newly received photo.

The girl in the picture wore a JK uniform with a bright smile. Vanessa sneered. "How could trash like her be worthy of marrying Ethan?"

"Let me see." Wendy took the phone, studied it carefully, and frowned. "She's quite pretty. That outfit would appeal to most men."

"Wendy!" Vanessa's voice sharpened abruptly.

Wendy chuckled awkwardly as she handed the phone back. "Just joking. She's nowhere near your league."

Internally, she noted Jenna's gentle aura and unique charm. But voicing that thought in front of Vanessa would be unwise.

Vanessa lifted her chin. "She's not even fit to polish my shoes. Grandma Blanche must be senile!"

Wendy stirred her coffee. "The old lady probably values her innocence. What's done is done. You should move on."

"Never!" Fire flashed in Vanessa's eyes. "Ethan belongs to me!"

Wendy shook her head helplessly. She'd advised Vanessa to pursue him openly before, but she'd been too proud. Now that he was married, she'd become obsessed.

"I have a nail appointment with Tanya." Wendy picked up her purse. "I should go."

Vanessa extended her slender hand. "I'll join you."
###Chapter 161

The midday sun streamed through the kitchen window as Jenna Roland bustled by the stove, an apron tied around her waist.

The doorbell rang abruptly.

She wiped her hands and hurried to the foyer to answer it.

Ethan Roscente stood at the door, dressed in an impeccably tailored black suit with a perfectly knotted tie. His sharp features looked even more striking in the sunlight. A casually dressed young man stood behind him.

"Mr. Roscente." Jenna smiled in greeting, then glanced at his companion. "And this is?"

"Justin Kemnis, from the charity foundation," Ethan introduced tersely.

Justin stepped forward with a sunny grin. "Miss Roland, it's an honor to finally meet you."

His tanned skin made his teeth appear brilliantly white, and his cropped hair gave him a clean-cut, energetic look.

Jenna nodded politely. "Mr. Kemnis, I'm Jenna Roland. Please come in."

She stepped aside to let them enter, then closed the door behind them.

In the living room, Jenna brought two glasses of lemon water. "Lunch will be ready soon. Please make yourselves comfortable."

Justin's gaze followed her. "You're even more beautiful than the rumors say."

Jenna's ears turned pink. She glanced at Ethan's impassive face. "Excuse me while I finish in the kitchen."

The moment the kitchen door shut, Justin eagerly leaned toward Ethan. "Damn, you lucky bastard! Where'd you find such a gorgeous wife?"

Ethan didn't even look up from his documents.

"Hey!" Justin nudged him with an elbow. "Does she have any single friends? Hook me up."

Ethan finally lifted his eyes, giving him a frosty glare. "Don't you have work to do?"

"I'm just happy for you!" Justin threw up his hands dramatically. "If I had a wife who could cook like that, I'd come home for every meal."

Ethan closed his file. "Then go help in the kitchen."

"You're impossible—" Justin began to complain when the kitchen door opened.

Jenna emerged carrying the final dish. "Lunch is served."

The table was set with six aromatic, beautifully presented dishes. Justin's eyes widened. "You made all this?"

"Just some home cooking," Jenna said modestly.

Justin stared at the braised pork ribs, practically drooling. "This is restaurant-quality!"

He took a bite and his face lit up. "Incredible!"

Ethan picked up his chopsticks with deliberate grace, the faintest hint of a smile tugging at his lips.
###Chapter 162

Jenna pulled out a chair and sat down, her gaze calm as she looked at Justin. "Mr. Kemnis, please eat."

"Thanks." Justin took the chopsticks without hesitation and picked up a piece of braised pork, popping it into his mouth.

After a few chews, his eyes lit up. "This is incredible, Ms. Roland! If you opened a restaurant, it'd be packed every day."

Jenna smiled faintly. "Just call me Jenna."

"Alright, Jenna." Justin set down his chopsticks. "Seriously, have you ever considered opening a place?"

She lowered her lashes. "I don't have the startup capital."

Her gaze flickered toward Ethan, who continued eating without expression.

Justin noticed and said breezily, "I could invest."

"Thank you, but no." She shook her head. "Too risky."

He didn't push. "The offer stands if you change your mind."

Internally, he studied the couple. Newlyweds, yet they acted like strangers.

After dinner, Jenna moved to clear the dishes when Ethan abruptly stood.

Justin's eyes widened as the CEO of HM Group efficiently stacked plates with practiced ease.

"Holy—" Justin blurted.

Ethan shot him an icy glare before carrying the dishes to the kitchen.

Jenna brought over freshly brewed tea. "Mr. Roscente, Mr. Kemnis, tea is served."

Justin finally couldn't hold back. "You always address each other so formally?"

"Is there a problem?" Jenna blinked in confusion.

Ethan's gaze turned glacial.

A chill ran down Justin's spine. He quickly changed the subject. "So... about your brother."
###Chapter 163

Jenna Roland lifted her gaze, her clear eyes meeting Justin Kemnis's. "What would you like to know, Mr. Kemnis?"

Justin lounged lazily on the leather sofa, his long legs crossed. His slender fingers rested casually on his knee. "Tell me about your family."

"My parents passed away when I was young." Jenna's voice was soft. "My brother and I were taken in by our uncle. After five years, we moved out on our own."

Justin frowned slightly. "Why your uncle's family?"

Jenna's fingers unconsciously twisted the hem of her shirt. "The other relatives... didn't want us." She paused. "Aren't you taking notes, Mr. Kemnis?"

"I'll brief my supervisor verbally." Justin's gaze darkened. "How is your brother now?"

"He has congenital heart disease." Jenna's voice tightened. "He was supposed to have surgery as a child, but it kept getting delayed. He's a high school sophomore now, with excellent grades." She pressed her lips together. "We only have each other."

Ethan Roscente handed Justin a cigarette and lit one for himself. Through the haze of smoke, his eyes flickered briefly toward Jenna.

"What happens if he doesn't get the surgery?" Justin exhaled a slow stream of smoke.

Jenna clenched her fists. "He'll die." Her voice trembled. "I work at the club to save up for his operation."

"How much do you need?"

"About eight hundred thousand at the local hospital." Jenna calculated quietly. "With follow-up treatments, close to nine hundred thousand total."

Justin tapped his cigarette ash. "I understand the situation. You'll have an answer within two days."

Jenna's tense shoulders finally relaxed. A faint smile touched her lips. "Thank you, Mr. Kemnis."

"Let's go." Justin stubbed out his cigarette.

Ethan rose to follow, pausing to give Jenna one last lingering look before leaving.

Inside the elevator, Justin slung an arm around Ethan's shoulders. "Your wife's had it rough."

Ethan coldly shrugged him off. "I know."

"Treat her well." Justin raised an eyebrow.

"None of your business." Ethan's tone was icy.

Justin persisted. "I played my part well, didn't I?"

Ethan frowned and swatted away Justin's hand as it returned to his shoulder. "Don't touch me."

"Stingy!" Justin pouted. "After all the help I gave you, I can't even put an arm around you?"

Ethan shoved his hands in his pockets and shot Justin a disdainful glare. "Your hands are filthy."
###Chapter 164

Justin Kemnis nearly choked on Ethan Roscente's words.

He glanced down at his own slender, well-groomed fingers, brows furrowing in irritation.

Did this germaphobe forget who just helped him deal with that difficult client?

Taking a deep breath to suppress his anger, Justin massaged his temples. "Ninety thousand. Transfer it now. I'll donate it to her under the charity fund's name."

Ethan didn't even look up, fingers tapping lightly on his phone screen.

A notification chimed on Justin's device.

"One hundred thousand?" Justin's voice rose as he stared at the amount. "Did your math teacher quit?"

Ethan gave him a cool glance. "The extra ten is seed money. Combined with her savings, it's enough to start a small business."

"Holy shit!" Justin's eyes widened. "Last time you acted like you couldn't care less about her. Turns out you're playing guardian angel behind the scenes? My bad, man."

Ethan's gaze turned icy just as the elevator doors opened.

He strode out, his broad shoulders radiating a clear "keep away" message.

Justin hurried after him, dress shoes clicking rapidly against the marble floor.

"So how'd you two meet anyway?" He nudged closer with gossipy enthusiasm. "Did you even hold hands at the courthouse?"

Ethan stopped abruptly.

Justin nearly collided with his back.

"One more word," Ethan turned, eyes glacial, "and you can find another investor for your new energy project."

Instant regret washed over Justin's face. He clasped his hands together. "Bro, I was wrong!"

His solar project was hanging by a financial thread, and Ethan was his only lifeline.

Without another word, Ethan walked off, the sharp lines of his tailored suit pants cutting through the air.

Justin trailed behind like a chastened puppy, voice softening. "About that investment..."

"After the Roland kid's surgery." Ethan yanked the car door open, his tone colder than the winter wind outside.

Justin wisely shut his mouth.

Inside the black Maybach, Ethan scrolled through his contacts, finger hovering over "Liam Melford."
###Chapter 165

Night fell as city lights flickered to life.

Jenna Roland was pouring drinks for Gavin Valentine's group in the VIP lounge when her phone buzzed in her pocket.

She discreetly retreated to a corner and glimpsed Justin Kemnis's name on the screen.

"Excuse me, I need to take this," she murmured to Gavin before slipping out of the room.

The hallway lighting was dim as she answered. "Mr. Kemnis, my apologies. I was with clients."

Justin's warm voice came through. "No worries. I called to inform you—the donation request has been approved."

Her fingers tightened around the phone. "Really?"

"Of course." His chuckle was light. "The board admires your resilience. One million dollars—nine hundred thousand for your brother's surgery, the remaining hundred thousand as your startup fund."

Tears welled up instantly.

She bit her lip hard to stifle a sob.

"Jenna?" Justin's tone turned concerned.

"I'm here..." Her voice cracked. "Thank you... truly..."

Milo Roland's condition couldn't wait. This money was a godsend.

A brief silence followed.

"I know your uncle's family mistreated you," Justin said suddenly. "But believe me, good people still exist."

She froze. "How do you know about my family?"

"Ethan told me." His reply was matter-of-fact.

Understanding dawned.

"Send me your bank details. The transfer will be processed tomorrow."

"Yes!" She wiped her tears. "Mr. Kemnis, you must come for dinner someday. I'll cook to express my gratitude."

"Consider it done." His agreement was cheerful.

Ending the call, Jenna leaned against the wall and exhaled deeply.

Milo's medical fees were finally secured.

......

The alarm blared at dawn.

Jenna drowsily silenced it, then gasped at the bank notification flashing on her screen.

She bolted upright, rubbing her eyes.

"One million... it's really here!"

Immediately, she dialed Ethan Roscente—determined to thank him in person.

The line rang endlessly before disconnecting.

Three attempts yielded the same result.

She checked the time: 10:00 AM.

"In a meeting?" she muttered.
###Chapter 166

Jenna stared blankly at her phone screen, her fingertips repeatedly swiping through the call log.

She worried Ethan might be in a meeting and didn't dare disturb him again. Turning away, she headed into the bathroom.

The warm water cascaded over her body, but the number "one million" kept flashing through her mind.

An amount she could hardly save after months working at the club, now effortlessly obtained with just one word from Ethan.

This sudden fortune filled her with both joy and unease.

After hastily drying her hair, Jenna skipped her skincare routine and grabbed her wallet to rush to the grocery market.

She wanted to prepare all of Ethan's favorite dishes before he came home.

Steam rose from the rice cooker in the kitchen as Jenna bent over sorting vegetables. Suddenly, her phone vibrated in her pocket.

The name "Ethan Roscente" on the screen made her breath hitch.

"Mr. Roscente, I didn't mean to call so many times..." she blurted out nervously, "I just wanted to thank you for the donation and ask what you'd like for lunch."

Ethan had just finished reprimanding his team in the conference room.

The project team's mistakes had darkened his mood, and the incessant phone notifications only aggravated his irritation.

Yet when Jenna's cautious voice came through, the knot in his chest unexpectedly loosened.

Like someone gently smoothing his furrowed brow.

Lighting a cigarette, his voice remained cool through the smoke: "No need to cater to my preferences."

Ever since he started coming home for meals, this woman had been subtly probing his tastes.

Even his mother hadn't been this attentive.

"But you're the pillar of this household," Jenna's voice softened. "You work so hard, I should at least..."

Ethan stubbed out his cigarette.

He recognized her fawning tone and remembered the guilt he owed her.

"As you wish," he finally conceded.

After hanging up, Ethan returned to his documents.

At 11:30, he grabbed his suit jacket to leave.

"Mr. Roscente!" Lucas hurried after him. "Your lunch meeting with Mr. Bo..."

Ethan paused mid-step.

He'd completely forgotten.

"Reschedule it for this afternoon."

Lucas broke into a sweat. "But Mr. Bo has already confirmed the timing. Changing it now might..."

One sharp glance from Ethan silenced him immediately.

Watching his CEO stride away, Lucas wiped his damp forehead.
###Chapter 167

Jenna Roland tied her apron and spent the entire morning bustling in the kitchen.

The flames danced merrily on the stove. The spatula clinked against the wok with crisp sounds.

She had specially prepared Ethan Roscente's favorite dishes—braised pork ribs, steamed sea bass, and garlic broccoli.

The dining table was set with four dishes and a soup, each perfectly presented.

Wiping sweat from her forehead, Jenna admired her handiwork with satisfaction.

Her phone suddenly rang, Ethan's name flashing on the screen.

"Mr. Roscente, I made your favorite dishes. When will you be home?"

His cold voice came through the line. "I have a client meeting. Won't be back for lunch."

Jenna's smile froze.

"But—"

The call ended abruptly, leaving only the dial tone.

She stared at her phone blankly before slowly setting it down.

The steaming dishes sat untouched, their aromas wafting through the empty dining room.

Jenna picked up her chopsticks and took a bite of the ribs.

Though prepared exactly to Ethan's taste, they now seemed flavorless.

She dialed her brother Milo Roland.

"Hey sis, I already ate at Ryan Watson's place," Milo answered cheerfully.

Jenna murmured a quiet "Okay" before hanging up.

Her finger scrolled through her contacts before landing on Stella Laurent's name.

"Hello, Jenna?" Stella's voice chirped through the phone.

"I made too much food. Would you and Jake like to come over?"

Stella gasped excitedly. "Perfect timing! We're at the supermarket nearby. We'll be right there!"

Twenty minutes later, the doorbell rang.

Stella walked in arm-in-arm with Jake Varley, both smiling brightly.

"Wow! Everything smells amazing!" Stella's eyes sparkled as she took in the spread.

Jake immediately grabbed chopsticks and sampled a bite. "Jenna, you could open a restaurant with skills like this!"

She gave a faint smile. "Just some simple dishes. Help yourselves."

Stella happily nibbled on a piece of fish, closing her eyes in delight.

Jake suddenly turned to Stella. "See how well Jenna cooks? You can't even make decent fried rice."

Stella's smile vanished, her chopsticks hovering mid-air.

Jenna frowned. "Jake, that's not fair."

He shrugged. "A woman should know how to cook. My grandma always said—"

Stella lowered her head, silently pushing rice around her bowl.

Jenna set down her chopsticks and locked eyes with Jake. "That's an outdated mindset."

As Jake opened his mouth to argue, Stella gently tugged his sleeve.

The cheerful atmosphere turned tense.

Seeing Stella's dejected expression, Jenna felt irritation rise in her chest.

She stood abruptly. "I'll get more soup from the kitchen."
###Chapter 168

Jenna's fingers clenched under the table, her nails nearly digging into her palms.

Jake Varley shoved a piece of braised pork into his mouth, mumbling with his mouth full, "What kind of woman can't even cook? My mom always says a woman who can't cook is just a useless decoration in the house."

Stella's face instantly paled.

"Oh?" Jenna let out a cold laugh. "Did your mom also teach you what to call a man who can't earn money?"

Jake paused mid-bite, then retorted with conviction, "We're in modern times now. Gender equality, ever heard of it? Why should men be the only ones making money?"

Jenna nearly snapped her chopsticks in half.

"So you're saying you won't do housework or earn a living?" She narrowed her eyes. "Planning to sustain yourself through photosynthesis?"

Jake shrugged indifferently. "Stella's got it covered. She makes plenty."

Stella's head jerked up, her eyes red-rimmed.

"I see." Jenna suddenly laughed. "You're just looking for a free maid and ATM in one."

Jake frowned. "That's a disgusting way to put it. Marriage is about mutual support. She handles the finances, I handle being eye candy. Sounds fair to me."

Jenna almost choked on her food.

"Jake Varley," she enunciated each word, "your face must be made of reinforced concrete."

Stella finally snapped. "Enough!"

She stood on trembling legs, tears welling in her eyes. "Jake, I must've been blind to ever like someone like you!"

Jake looked genuinely baffled. "What's your problem? What did I say wrong?"

Jenna dabbed her lips with a napkin, calm as ever. "Stella, it's not too late to cut your losses. A man like this isn't even worth keeping around as holiday decor."

Only then did Jake realize what was happening. He slammed his hands on the table and shot to his feet. "Jenna! You're sabotaging us!"

Jenna rose, looking down at him with icy disdain. "If I were you, I'd leave now. Unless—" She waved her phone. "You'd like your brilliant philosophy shared online for public judgment."

Jake's face cycled through several shades before settling on fury. He shot Stella a venomous glare. "You'll regret this!"

The door slammed shut with enough force to rattle the walls.

Stella finally broke down into sobs.

Jenna pulled her into a gentle embrace. "Don't waste tears on trash like that."

"I spent so much money on him..." Stella hiccuped.

"Consider it tuition." Jenna's smile was razor-sharp. "At least now you can spot garbage from a mile away."

Her gaze fell on the half-eaten meal, and sudden nausea twisted her stomach.

Men like Jake didn't deserve even the food she cooked.
###Chapter 169

Stella Laurent studied Jenna Roland's face for a moment before nodding softly.

"I understand."

Jenna stirred her coffee, watching the milk foam swirl. She changed the subject. "If I quit the club, what do you think I should do? Maybe open a small shop?"

Stella's chopsticks froze mid-air.

"The Red Cross approved the donation?" Her voice rose sharply.

A bright smile curved Jenna's lips as she pulled a bank card from her purse, twirling it between her fingers.

"One million. Already deposited."

Jake Varley, who'd been shoveling rice into his mouth, jerked his head up, grains sticking to his lips.

"What?!" Stella's chopsticks clattered onto the table. "One million?"

She'd never even held a hundred thousand in cash before.

Jenna waved the card. "Ninety thousand for the surgery. The remaining ten is startup capital."

Stella frowned. "Why so much?"

"Maybe because my brother and I are tragic enough." Jenna shrugged.

As Stella reached for more food, Jake suddenly leaned in, his face plastered with an ingratiating grin.

"Jenna, your brother's perfectly fine now, right? No rush for surgery. How about lending me twenty grand? Stella can pay you back slowly."

The air turned to ice.

Both women swiveled to stare at him like he'd grown a second head.

Jenna let out a cold laugh, tapping the table with one manicured nail.

"Jake Varley, your shamelessness never fails to amaze me."

Unfazed, he smirked. "Stella makes good money at the club. She'll pay you back fast!"

Stella shot to her feet, grabbing his collar.

She dragged him to the door and shoved him out with enough force to rattle the frame.

"We're done." Each word dripped with venom. "Never show your face here again."

The door slammed shut.

Jake stood dumbfounded in the hallway before pounding on the wood.

"Stella! Open this damn door!"

Inside, Stella returned to the table and resumed eating, her expression unreadable.
###Chapter 170

Jenna Roland had been furious at Jake Varley's disgusting remarks earlier. But seeing Stella Laurent decisively kick him out and break up with him instantly lifted her mood.

She'd been hoping Stella would dump this scumbag for ages, but Stella had stubbornly refused to see the truth.

Who knew she'd finally cut him off so cleanly today?

What a pleasant surprise.

Jake kept pounding on the door outside, screaming Stella's name hoarsely.

Stella ignored him completely, calmly picking up food with her chopsticks.

Jenna peeked at her and couldn't help laughing. "He's wailing like a wounded animal. Really not going to acknowledge him?"

Stella set down her chopsticks. "This is the third breakup. The first two times, he got on his knees begging me to take him back, promising to change. Three years together—I always caved and forgave him. But not this time."

"Just like that? Three years of history?"

Stella gave a bitter smile. "You heard him. He treated me like a free maid. I worked my ass off at the club to support him, and he still fooled around behind my back. Forgiving him again would just make me pathetic."

"Honestly, besides his looks, he's not even fit to lick Tristan's pinky."

Tristan was Stella's ex before Jake.

That gentle, considerate man never let Stella lift a finger at home, always cooking her delicious meals.

Compared to Jake, he was in a completely different league.

Too bad Tristan went abroad for further studies. Otherwise, Jake would never have stood a chance.

Stella shook her head. "Looking back now, I must've been possessed to stay with Jake for three whole years."

Jenna's eyes curved with amusement. "Better late than never."

"Yeah." Stella stood up. "Let me help you clean up."

They worked in comfortable silence, washing dishes and wiping counters together.

By the time they returned to the living room, the pounding and shouting outside had stopped.

Jenna grabbed two ice-cold colas from the fridge and tossed one to Stella.

Stella took a long swig. "Figured out what you want to do next?"

Jenna flopped onto the couch with a sigh. "No degree means no corporate jobs. Starting a business is too risky. No experience running a restaurant either. Honestly clueless."

"Didn't your parents leave you that orchard?" Stella's eyes lit up. "Hire a lawyer to sue your uncle and get it back!"

The words struck Jenna like lightning.

Of course! Now that she had money, she could hire a lawyer after her brother's surgery!

She excitedly slapped Stella's shoulder. "If you're sick of the club by then, come work with me!"

Stella grinned and clinked their soda cans together. "Deal."

She'd long grown tired of the club scene—endless drinking sessions and fending off handsy clients.

Jake had forbidden her from quitting before. Now that they were done, she could finally make her own choices.
###Chapter 171

Jenna Roland dragged her exhausted body home at 3 AM.

She barely slept four hours, waking with the first light of dawn. The thought of discussing Milo's hospitalization had kept her restless.

The sound of a closing door echoed from the living room.

Rubbing her eyes, she noticed Ethan Roscente's absence from the bedroom. She threw on a robe and found her brother hunched over a bowl of noodles.

"Sis?" Milo looked up, startled. "You're awake already?"

"We need to talk about your surgery." She stifled a yawn as she sat down.

Milo paused mid-bite. "Did the Red Cross transfer come through?"

"Yes. One million." She nodded. "I want you admitted this week."

"But finals are coming up." He hesitated. "Can we wait till summer break?"

"Fine." She considered. "First day of vacation, then."

"Want some noodles?" He started toward the kitchen.

"No thanks." She smiled. "By the way, where's Mr. Roscente? Didn't he eat?"

Milo smirked. "Not since he tasted my cooking last time."

"Must not be his preference." She patted his shoulder. "Enjoy your meal. I'm going back to sleep."

"Sis." He stopped her. "Now that we have the money, quit the club job. Hire a lawyer to reclaim our orchard. We'll make it thrive again."

"I know." She waved dismissively before retreating to her room.

Sleep claimed her the moment her head hit the pillow.

Sunlight flooded the room when she awoke.

10:30 AM. Her fingers hovered over her phone before texting Ethan.

His reply came instantly: Be back for lunch.

She sprang from bed to prepare the meal. Yesterday's untouched feast was replaced with all his favorite dishes.

At noon sharp, the doorbell rang.

Ethan stood framed in the doorway, his tailored black shirt accentuating his broad shoulders. The sharp angles of his face remained impassive.

"Mr. Roscente." She stepped aside with a quiet greeting.

He gave a curt nod and headed straight for the bathroom.

She hurried to plate the food. When she returned, he was already seated at the table.

His brow furrowed at the elaborate spread.

"Special occasion?" His cool gaze lifted to meet hers.
###Chapter 172

Jenna Roland slid the carefully prepared lunchbox toward Ethan Roscente. A faint smile touched her lips as she sat across from him.

"The Red Cross just transferred the donation to my account." Her voice was soft. "Thanks to your help. I made this meal specially for you—every dish tailored to your taste."

Ethan picked up his chopsticks in silence and took a bite of the braised carp.

"Thank you, Mr. Roscente." Jenna pressed her lips together.

He glanced up briefly. "No need."

She nodded and began eating.

Midway through the meal, she couldn't resist asking, "Have you finalized arrangements with Dr. Liam Melford?"

Ethan set down his chopsticks, his gaze cool as ever. "He'll come whenever Milo is admitted."

Jenna's eyes brightened. "Dr. Melford actually agreed to operate on Milo?"

"Pro bono." Ethan added curtly before resuming his meal.

Jenna froze.

Pro bono?

The internationally renowned specialist was willing to perform the surgery for free?

"Why would he waive the fee?" she asked, puzzled.

"He sympathizes with your situation." Ethan didn't look at her.

In truth, while Liam had waived the surgical fees, he'd taken a keen interest in one of Ethan's antique paintings. As a seasoned collector, Liam had already appraised its value—at least three million.

Combined with the million Ethan had transferred to Jenna through the Red Cross, he'd spent over four million to make amends.

But as his nominal wife, spending this amount on her wasn't unreasonable.

"Dr. Melford has a healer's heart," Jenna murmured. "But Milo wants to wait until summer vacation for the surgery. Would it be possible for the doctor to come then?"

"Fine." Ethan's reply was clipped.

Jenna exhaled in relief. "Thank you."

Just after the meal, Ethan's phone rang.

It was Lucas Roscente.

After hanging up, Jenna recognized the gravity in his expression.

"Go ahead," she offered. "I'll handle the dishes."

Ethan nodded. As he stood, he paused. "I'll wash them tomorrow."

Jenna smiled. "We'll see."

After cleaning up, she napped until four in the afternoon. Upon waking, she dialed Daisy Langley.

"Can you resend that lawyer's contact info?"

"Didn't I send it already?"

"I didn't save it. My messages got cleared."

Daisy promptly forwarded the number after hanging up.

Jenna made the call. A warm male voice answered, "Hugo Valence speaking. How may I help you?"

"Mr. Valence, this is Jenna Roland." She straightened. "I consulted you before about legal action. The funds are secured now—I'd like to schedule a meeting."
###Chapter 173

Hugo Valence's deep voice came through the phone. "Three o'clock tomorrow afternoon. Blue Bottle Coffee."

Jenna Roland tightened her grip on the phone. "Understood, Mr. Valence."

After hanging up, she ate a quick bowl of plain noodle soup before heading to work.

As she arrived at Studio 54's entrance, a black sedan pulled up smoothly.

Tristan Ashcroft stepped out, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit.

"Boss!" Jenna called out.

Tristan turned, the corner of his mouth lifting. "Perfect timing."

Jenna parked her e-bike, fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her blouse.

"Something wrong?" Tristan raised an eyebrow.

Jenna glanced around. "Can we talk inside?"

Tristan nodded and led the way into the club.

Inside VIP Room 888, Jenna closed the door and took a deep breath.

"Boss, the Red Cross donated a million for my brother's surgery. I was thinking—"

Tristan's brow furrowed. "You're resigning?"

Jenna nodded. "I'll take him for the procedure this summer."

Tristan pulled out a cigarette case and lit one.

Through the haze, his gaze turned sharp.

"Confident about the orchard dispute?"

Jenna pressed her lips together. "If we win it back, I plan to run it myself."

Tristan exhaled a smoke ring. "You'd earn more staying here."

Jenna froze.

She hadn't expected Tristan to object.

Her recent performances had indeed boosted the club's revenue significantly.

"My family doesn't approve of this job..."

Tristan stubbed out his cigarette and met her eyes directly.

"You're valuable. I don't want to let you go."

Jenna's chest tightened.
###Chapter 174

"Jenna, I promise no one can touch you." Tristan Ashcroft's gaze was sharp as a blade, his voice low and resolute.

He had never been this serious before.

Jenna clenched the hem of her shirt, her fingertips turning pale. "Boss, I have to resign."

If it weren't for Ethan Roscente's influence, he would never let her go.

But Ethan's woman was someone he couldn't afford to cross.

Tristan took a deep breath, shifting his gaze away from her. He stared at the closed VIP room door and took five quick drags from his cigarette.

"Do as you wish," he finally said.

Jenna bowed deeply. "Thank you for everything."

Tristan smirked. "If the orchard doesn't work out, you can always come back."

"Okay." She forced a weak smile before turning to leave.

The moment the door shut, Tristan crushed his cigarette and dialed Gavin Valentine.

"Gavin, Jenna's resigning," he stated bluntly.

Gavin, just waking up, bolted upright. "What? She was doing great!"

"The Red Cross donated a million for her brother's surgery," Tristan muttered. "She's going back to run the orchard and fight for her inheritance."

Gavin took a sip of water. "Isn't that good? That place wasn't right for her."

"But she was my top earner," Tristan gritted out.

Gavin lit a cigarette. "Calling me won't change anything."

"Forget it." Tristan hung up abruptly.

Shaking his head, Gavin dialed Ethan instead.

"Ethan, did you know Jenna's resigning?"

"No." The voice on the other end was icy.

"Should I still keep an eye on the club?" Gavin scratched his short hair.

Ethan's tone dropped even colder. "She hasn't left yet."

"Fine." Gavin scowled and ended the call.
###Chapter 175

Jenna Roland had just reached the stairwell when she nearly collided with Gavin Valentine and Oliver Macmillan.

Her brows knitted slightly.

They'd been visiting far too often lately.

Gavin strode forward with a faint smile. "Busy?"

"Mhm. Getting drinks." Jenna turned to Stella Laurent. "Please escort Mr. Valentine to the private room."

Stella responded briskly. "This way, Mr. Valentine."

Gavin followed her into VIP Room 304.

After settling them in, Stella exited.

In the hallway, Jenna approached with two servers carrying trays of alcohol.

"I'll deliver these," Stella intercepted. "You should join Mr. Valentine."

Jenna shook her head. "Can't. This order is for Tony Lombardi's wife. I need to handle it personally."

Stella hesitated, then relented.

Inside the private room, Wendy Lombardi was belting out a duet with her girlfriends.

Spotting Jenna, Wendy immediately dropped the microphone and waved. "Jenna! Over here!"

Jenna set down the bottles and took a seat beside her. "What do you need, Wendy?"

"I lost at finger-guessing," Wendy pouted. "Win this round for me."

Chloe Blanchet protested. "No fair, Wendy."

Lily Evans chimed in. "Yeah, you can't bring in reinforcements just because you're unlucky."

Wendy planted her hands on her hips. "Pregnant women get special privileges!"

Chloe sighed in defeat. "Fine, have it your way."

Jenna checked her watch. "I need to attend to other guests first. I'll come back later."

Wendy cheerfully agreed.

The moment Jenna left, the room erupted with chatter.

Chloe muted the music. "Since when do you have a sister, Wendy?"

Lily leaned in. "And one who works at a place like this?"

Wendy sipped her juice leisurely. "Tony's sworn sister. Completely respectable, and an amazing cook."

The girls exchanged skeptical glances.

"You're joking, right?" Vanessa Galatea asked doubtfully.

Wendy smirked. "She cooked for us last time. Absolutely divine."

Lily's interest piqued. "Now I want to try her dishes too."
###Chapter 176

Wendy Lombardi's lips curved slightly. "We'll talk another time."

Lily Evans abruptly changed the subject. "With so many escort girls here, your husband must have called for their services when he comes drinking?"

Wendy took a sip of juice, her gaze settling on Lily's face. "Jenna said he never has."

Lily burst into laughter, the sound dripping with mockery.

"Sweetie, you believe everything she says? Maybe she's been bribed by your husband. You're so gullible."

Chloe Blanchet immediately chimed in. "Exactly. You can't just trust whatever people tell you."

Wendy crossed her arms, her eyes fixed on the TV screen ahead. Her red lips parted. "I trust her."

Seeing her stubbornness, Lily and the others exchanged glances.

If she wanted to believe Jenna Roland, what more could they say?

They could only hope she wouldn't be betrayed by the person she trusted most.

Twenty minutes later, Jenna pushed the door open.

Wendy's eyes lit up. "Finished with work?"

Jenna smiled and nodded, taking a seat beside her. "Yes. Here to help you win a few rounds."

"Great." Wendy shot a challenging look at Lily and the others. "I've brought backup. You're going down."

Chloe smirked. "That confident?"

Jenna asked gently, "What are we playing? Finger guessing or dice?"

"Finger guessing!" Chloe declared firmly. "You against the three of us. If we lose, we buy drinks. If you lose, you answer our questions honestly."

Jenna instantly understood the real purpose of this game.

Lily and Fiona Valrose nodded eagerly.

Wendy suddenly spoke up. "If Jenna wins, each of you buys a bottle of Romanée-Conti."

Jenna stared at Wendy in shock.

Lily snapped her fingers. "Deal!"

A mere $26,000 bottle of wine was nothing to her.

Wendy winked at Jenna. "Do your best."

Jenna smiled knowingly and turned to Lily. "Lily, you first?"

"Bring it on!" Lily thrust out her hand aggressively. "Brothers unite!"

Jenna responded swiftly. "Three stars shine!"

Fiona and Chloe watched the duel with bated breath.

Three rounds later, Lily was defeated.

"My apologies, Lily." Jenna grinned, her eyes crinkling.

Lily pushed Chloe forward reluctantly. "Your turn."

Chloe flexed her wrists, eyeing Jenna challengingly. "I won't go easy on you."

Jenna met her gaze, her smile unwavering. "Likewise."

Their locked eyes crackled with tension.
###Chapter 177

Yuanmei, Li Xinyue, and Chen Yuanyuan fell to Jenna Roland one after another. Now only Yuanmei remained.

The best-of-three rule still applied.

The outcome was predictable. Yuanmei, too, became another victim of Jenna's prowess.

The three women exchanged helpless glances before turning to Wendy Lombardi with pouts, complaining about Jenna's unbeatable skills.

Wendy threw an arm around Jenna's shoulders and smirked triumphantly. "Now you see how good she is? Pay up—go buy the wine."

Never in their wildest dreams had they imagined all three would lose to Jenna!

Though bitter, a bet was a bet. They pooled their money and purchased a $26,000 bottle of Romanée-Conti.

A classic case of adding insult to injury.

Wendy patted Jenna. "You can go now, Jenna."

"Alright." Jenna stood, her gaze lingering on Wendy. "Call me if you need anything, sis."

As she stepped out of the private room, she nearly collided with Chloe Blanchet emerging from next door.

Jenna shut the door behind her, puzzled. "Weren't you on leave today?"

Chloe had been absent during the meeting, with Supervisor Patrick Klein citing her leave.

Chloe grinned and sidled up to her. "My dad came to town. I was supposed to pick him up, but my cousin had the day off, so he went instead."

Jenna nodded. "I see."

Chloe slung an arm around her shoulders. "Heard you're resigning?"

Jenna massaged her temples. "Stella Laurent really can't keep her mouth shut!"

"So it's true?" Chloe's eyes widened.

"Yeah." Jenna explained her reasons in detail.

Chloe gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Your brother's surgery comes first. He shouldn't be alone during recovery. You're making the right choice."

"No other option." Jenna sighed. "After I'm gone, work hard and get rich. Aim to be millionaires soon."

Chloe burst out laughing. "From your lips to God's ears."

......

The next evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Jenna pulled up to Blue Bottle Coffee on her e-bike.

After parking, she dialed Hugo Valence's number.

He answered immediately, saying he'd already arrived and she should come straight in.

Hanging up, Jenna entered the café. Turning left toward the main seating area, she spotted a man in a white dress shirt, charcoal-gray tie, and black vest waving at her.

For a split second, Jenna froze—until he called out, "Ms. Roland?"

Approaching his table, she offered an apologetic smile. "Attorney Valence, my apologies. I didn't recognize you at first."
###Chapter 178

Hugo Valence sat on the leather couch in the coffee shop, his silver-rimmed glasses perched on his high nose bridge. His deep-set eyes behind the lenses were like bottomless pools.

His pale complexion and sharp features exuded aristocratic elegance. The slight curve of his thin lips completed the image of a noble-born gentleman.

Jenna Roland froze. She had expected a greasy middle-aged lawyer, not this strikingly handsome man.

This man could probably win court cases with his looks alone.

Hugo stood, extending his long, well-defined fingers. "Miss Roland, I've heard much about you."

Jenna snapped out of her daze and shook his hand politely. "Mr. Valence."

His touch was ice-cold, like holding a piece of jade.

"Please, have a seat." He gestured.

A server approached. Jenna ordered a latte, her smile perfectly measured.

Hugo requested black coffee before turning his gaze back to her. "Tell me about the orchard."

Jenna tensed.

"It was my parents' legacy, registered under my father's name. After their car accident five years ago, the will stated my uncle would manage it until I married, then return it to me."

Hugo raised an eyebrow. "You're married?"

"I rushed into a marriage of convenience to reclaim the orchard." Jenna's smile turned bitter. "But my uncle refused to honor the agreement."

"What's the orchard's annual income?"

"About eighty thousand." Her fists clenched. "My brother needs heart surgery. I begged them for a loan on my knees. They gave nothing."

Her voice remained steady, but pain flickered in her eyes.

Hugo's pen scratched across his notepad.

"What responsibilities did you have at your uncle's house?"

"I did all the housework, worked in the orchard, paid rent and living expenses after getting a job." Her voice grew hoarse. "We never took advantage."

Hugo suddenly closed his notebook. "A car accident and a will—don't you find that contradictory?"

Jenna's pupils constricted.

"How could they have prepared a will for an unexpected crash? Unless..." His gaze turned knowing.

Jenna's fingers trembled. "I did find the will in my parents' bedroom. But..."
###Chapter 179

"Go ahead." Hugo Valence's expression was stern, his gaze piercing.

Jenna Roland bit her lower lip hesitantly before speaking. "My brother mentioned the handwriting in the suicide note didn't resemble Dad's. But he was young then, and I didn't pay much attention."

Hugo suddenly straightened, his knuckles tapping rhythmically against the desk.

"Did your father write often?"

"He handled all the orchard receipts." Jenna nodded. "He also practiced calligraphy regularly at home."

Hugo's eyes sharpened. "Are those receipts and calligraphy samples still available?"

"Uncle Victor burned them." Jenna frowned. "He said it would spare us painful memories. Why do you ask, Mr. Valence?"

Leaning back into the sofa, Hugo met her gaze directly. "Current evidence suggests your parents were likely murdered. But today's focus isn't on that—it's the orchard."

Jenna's pupils contracted violently, her fingers trembling uncontrollably.

"Murder?"

Hugo adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, a cold glint flashing behind the lenses. "Almost certainly."

Her face drained of color, lips quivering.

The police had ruled it an accident back then.

"Suicide notes aren't left in accidental deaths." Hugo's words struck like a scalpel.

Jenna's mind went blank.

Who would want her parents dead?

"Miss Roland." Hugo interrupted her spiraling thoughts. "Do you have proof the orchard belonged to your parents?"

"Not on hand..." Her voice shook. "But the business registration should be under Dad's name."

Hugo's expression darkened. "If your uncle hasn't changed the registration, our chances are good. But if it's already transferred..."

"Is there no recourse?" Jenna pressed urgently.

"Unless he voluntarily returns it." Hugo shook his head. "Given what you've described, that's highly unlikely."

Her fists clenched. "Can't the law force him to return it?"

"If he claims it was a legal transfer or verbal agreement..." Hugo's tone grew grave. "Our odds plummet."

"So we need either the suicide note or his sudden conscience?"

"Precisely."

A server arrived with coffee, steam curling between them.

Hugo sipped his black coffee, gaze unwavering. "The legal system demands evidence. Without proof, the court won't intervene."

The world spun around Jenna. She'd assumed hiring a lawyer would reclaim the orchard—never imagining the legal path would prove this treacherous.
###Chapter 180

The coffee in Jenna Roland's cup had long gone cold, untouched. She ran her fingers through her hair in frustration, leaving faint red marks on her scalp.

"Doesn't the Commerce Bureau have my father's records?" Her voice was strained.

Hugo Valence adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "First, verify if the orchard transfer was legally processed. If the procedure was proper, the orchard is no longer yours."

Jenna clenched her fists. "If there were irregularities, could I reclaim it through litigation?"

"Theoretically, yes." Hugo nodded. "Prove unlawful seizure of property, and the court will rule in your favor."

"I'll check tomorrow." She bit her lower lip. "Hugo... is there still hope of uncovering the truth about my parents' case?"

His expression darkened. "After all these years, the evidence chain is likely broken. Unless new leads emerge..." He paused. "If the killer was meticulous, chances are slim."

Jenna lowered her voice abruptly. "Could it be my uncle?"

Hugo's gaze sharpened behind his lenses. "Do you have proof?"

"He burned all their belongings." Her fingers trembled. "Even their suicide note vanished. Why destroy everything unless he's guilty?"

Hugo considered this. "Search his home. If you find the note or evidence, the case could turn."

A cold glint flashed in Jenna's eyes. "Understood."

Hugo set down his cup and pulled out his wallet. Two hundred-dollar bills remained beneath the saucer. "Contact me with any leads." He stood, his suit pants sharply creased.

"Let me get the coffee," Jenna insisted, rising quickly.

The corner of Hugo's mouth lifted. "My principle is never letting a lady pay." He grabbed his briefcase, leaving a trace of crisp pine scent in his wake.

Jenna watched his tall figure disappear through the glass door.

When she sat again, the coffee was ice-cold. She downed it in one gulp, bitterness exploding on her tongue. Her hands shook violently around the cup—her parents had been murdered.

The porcelain clattered against the tray.

Whoever the killer was, she vowed to make them pay in blood.

Stepping outside, the harsh sunlight made her squint. Then her blood ran cold—Ethan Roscente was stepping out of a black sedan.

Their eyes locked. Jenna's mind went blank.

Ethan froze. At least it wasn't the custom Rolls-Royce today, he thought grimly. That would've been impossible to explain.
###Chapter 181

Jenna Roland snapped back to reality and strode toward Ethan Roscente, a faint smile playing on her lips.

"Mr. Roscente, what a coincidence."

Ethan's gaze flickered past her to the Blue Bottle Coffee sign behind her, his brow furrowing slightly.

"Shouldn't you be at the club at this hour?"

She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear.

"My uncle seized the orchard my parents left me. I just finished meeting with my lawyer."

"Hugo Valence?"

A subtle shift crossed Ethan's eyes.

Jenna's eyes widened in surprise.

"You know Attorney Valence?"

His expression smoothed back into neutrality.

"We've crossed paths once."

He paused.

"Strong case?"

She studied the impeccably dressed man before her—his tailored suit, the perfectly knotted tie.

"It depends on proving ownership of the orchard."

Suddenly realizing something, she hesitated.

"Are you here for..."

Ethan glanced at his Patek Philippe.

"Business dinner."

Jenna took a polite step back.

"I won't keep you then."

He gave a curt nod.

Turning, she walked toward her parked e-bike and swung her leg over the seat with practiced ease.

As she started the engine, the rearview mirror still reflected his tall, unmoving figure.

......

Wind roared past her ears.

Yet Jenna's thoughts drifted back to that car accident three years ago.

The police had ruled it an accident.

But her instincts screamed otherwise.

Her parents had been kind souls who never made enemies.

Who could have—

Her phone's ringtone shattered the memory.

"Hey sis, can I sleep over at Ryan's tonight?"

She braked to a stop.

"Don't forget to buy the cake."

"I've got allowance!"

Checking the time, she quickened her pace toward Studio 54.

Neon lights already pulsed against the twilight.
###Chapter 182

As soon as the conference room door closed, Jenna pulled Stella into the lounge.

"I'm exhausted. That meeting felt like a battlefield." Jenna collapsed onto the sofa.

Before Stella could respond, Patrick pushed the door open.

"Stella, your boyfriend is waiting for you downstairs."

Stella's face paled. "What boyfriend?"

Jenna quickly added, "She broke up with Jake Varley ages ago."

Patrick shrugged. "He introduced himself as your boyfriend. I'm just the messenger." He turned and left without another word.

Jenna noticed Stella's clenched fists. "Don't worry. This is our turf. If he causes trouble, the boss will have security throw him out in seconds."

Stella took a deep breath. "Come with me."

In the lobby, Jake stood under the crystal chandelier holding ninety-nine red roses. His eyes lit up when he saw Stella.

With a dramatic thud, he dropped to one knee.

"Stella, I was wrong." He lifted the roses. "I apologize for what I said at Jenna's place."

Whispers erupted among the staff.

"How romantic!"
"Forgive him already!"

Stella smirked. "Jake Varley, do you really think I'm still that naive girl you could manipulate?"

Jenna finally exhaled in relief.

Undeterred, Jake continued his plea. "I swear I'll change. I can't live without you."

"Your promises are worthless." Stella turned to leave.

Jake sprang up, his gaze darkening as it locked onto Jenna. "This is all your fault, you bitch!"

He hurled the roses at her. The thorny stems left a dozen bloody scratches across her collarbone.

Jenna retaliated with a sharp slap across his face, followed by a swift kick to his abdomen.
###Chapter 183

Chloe Blanchet's wine glass shattered on the floor.

Jenna Roland's outburst caught everyone off guard.

Stella Laurent shoved Jake Varley away violently. He stumbled and knocked over a coffee table.

"Jake!" Stella's voice trembled. "Have you lost your mind?"

Chloe immediately pulled out her phone and dialed their boss.

Jake scrambled to his feet, his eyes dark with malice as he glared at Jenna. "You bitch. This isn't over."

Jenna let out a cold laugh and yanked her collar down to reveal bruises. "Think you can just walk away?"

Stella swiftly locked the club's main entrance.

Jake's face paled. "What the hell are you doing?"

The air turned icy when Tristan Ashcroft stormed in with four bodyguards.

"I heard someone wants to trash my place?" Tristan's voice was laced with venom.

Jake's knees buckled. "Mr. Ashcroft, this is all a misunderstanding—"

"Go ahead." Tristan kicked over a nearby vase. "Trash it. I dare you."

Jake suddenly lunged at Stella. "Beg for me! Please!"

Stella recoiled in disgust. "In your dreams."

"Mr. Ashcroft!" Jake lowered his voice. "Stella's... very good at pleasing men. I'll give her to you—"

Stella's face drained of color.

Jenna grabbed a wine bottle and raised it. "You disgusting pig!"

"Beat him!" Tristan snarled. "Until he can't move."
###Chapter 184

The burly men responded in unison, striding toward Jake Varley.

Jake shrank back in terror, but one of them yanked him up by the collar.

Fists rained down on him like a storm, the dull thuds echoing through the warehouse.

Jenna Roland watched coldly, her nails digging into her palms.

Two minutes later, Jake lay crumpled on the ground, his face swollen beyond recognition. He tried to push himself up but gasped in pain.

"Stop." Stella Laurent suddenly spoke up.

Tristan Ashcroft arched an eyebrow at her.

"He's not worth catching a murder charge over," Stella said through gritted teeth.

Jenna flexed her injured shoulder. "Make him pay."

"Thirty thousand," she added.

Jake nodded frantically like a drowning man clutching at straws. "I'll pay... I'll pay..."

One of the enforcers fished out his phone from his pocket and shoved it into his hand.

"Password is six zeros," Jake coughed up blood. "Payment code is 312765."

Stella suddenly snatched the phone. "How much is in your account?"

Jake's eyes darted nervously.

"Talk!" Tristan stomped on his hand.

"One hundred thousand!" Jake screamed.

Stella's hands trembled. She remembered when her father was hospitalized, Jake had claimed he didn't have a penny to spare.

"Where did this money come from?" Her voice shook.

"You... you gave it to me..." Jake cowered. "I saved it all..."

Stella's vision darkened. She had scrimped and saved every month to send him money, only for him to hoard it all.

Her fingers flew across the screen as she transferred the entire sum.

"Get out." She hurled the phone at Jake's face. "If I ever see you again, I'll report you for fraud."

Jake opened his mouth to protest, but two enforcers dragged him out by his arms.

The warehouse door slammed shut.

Only then did Stella finally break down in tears.
###Chapter 185

Tristan Ashcroft signaled his men to carry Jake Varley out of Studio 54 once the situation was under control.

He followed them outside.

Under the dim streetlights, Tristan hailed a cab and shoved five hundred-dollar bills into the driver's hand.

"Take him to the hospital," Tristan said coldly.

The driver pocketed the cash without hesitation.

Watching the taxi disappear down the road, Tristan turned to his four enforcers.

"You'll be stationed here from now on," he said in a low voice. "Deal with troublemakers immediately."

"Yes, boss," they chorused.

Back inside, Tristan strode straight to Jenna Roland.

Tiny cuts marred the skin below her neck, glinting painfully under the lights.

"Those need medical attention," Tristan frowned.

Jenna shook her head. "Just minor scratches. Some disinfectant will do."

Worry flickered in Tristan's eyes.

This happened on his turf. If Ethan Roscente found out...

He turned to Stella Laurent. "Get the iodine from my office."

Stella returned swiftly with antiseptic swabs.

"Let me help," she said, gently dabbing at Jenna's wounds.

Tristan scanned the room, locking eyes with every employee present.

"Remember," his voice rang with authority, "handle any disturbances with force. I'll take responsibility."

Nods rippled through the crowd.

Most staff had worked here since the club opened eight years ago. They knew Tristan's character well.

After issuing instructions, Tristan took the elevator to his sixth-floor office.

The door clicked shut as he sank heavily into his leather chair.

His phone lit up with Ethan's name.

Tristan's finger hovered over the call button.

Tell Ethan? The man would blame him for poor management.

Keep quiet? The consequences would be worse when Ethan inevitably discovered the truth.

He raked a hand through his hair and lit a cigarette.

Amid the swirling smoke, Tristan dialed Patrick Klein.

"Send Jenna to my office."

Patrick responded promptly: "She's currently entertaining Gavin Valentine's group."

Inside VIP Room 308, Gavin's gaze burned into the wounds on Jenna's chest.

"Who did this?" His voice could freeze hell.

Jenna opened her mouth to explain when new guests interrupted.

Only after entering the private room did she recount the incident in full.

When she described Jake striking her with roses, Gavin shot to his feet.

His fist smashed down onto the glass coffee table.
###Chapter 186

"Say that again. Those injuries were inflicted by someone?" Gavin Valentine shot up from his seat, his voice sharp with disbelief.

Jenna Roland took an involuntary step back, startled by his sudden intensity.

She'd never seen Gavin lose his composure like this.

Those usually playful eyes now burned with raw fury—as if she were someone he cherished deeply.

"Mr. Valentine..." Jenna frowned in confusion. "Your reaction seems... excessive."

They were barely acquaintances.

Gavin caught himself, sinking heavily back into the sofa.

He drew a slow breath, forcing calm into his voice. "The usual drink, please."

"Of course. One moment." Jenna gave a slight nod and turned to leave the private room.

The instant the door closed, Gavin yanked out his phone and dialed Tristan Ashcroft.

"Tristan!" he snarled. "Are you trying to get me killed?"

On the other end, Tristan winced at the roar in his office. "What the hell happened?"

"Jenna was assaulted at your damn club!" Gavin's voice turned glacial. "How am I supposed to explain this to Ethan?"

Tristan's stomach dropped.

He'd expected Ethan Roscente's anger—but not Gavin's visceral reaction.

"Which room are you in?" he demanded.

Upon hearing "308," Tristan rushed over immediately.

When he pushed open the door, Jenna was pouring Gavin's drink.

"Leave us," Tristan ordered.

Jenna paused, glancing at Gavin for confirmation.

Receiving none, she set down the decanter and slipped out silently.

The moment the door clicked shut, Gavin exploded.

"Did you see the gashes on her neck?" He jabbed a finger toward the exit. "A dozen of them! If Ethan finds out, we're finished!"

Tristan's jaw tightened. "I wasn't there when it happened. Chloe called about Stella's ex causing trouble. By the time I arrived, Jake Varley had already attacked her."

Gavin massaged his temples. "Damage control. Now."

"Let Jenna explain it herself," Tristan said after a beat. "We'll craft a plausible story—one that doesn't implicate us."

"You think she'll cooperate?"

"Worth a try."

Gavin lit a cigarette, inhaling deeply. "You handle it. Call me if she refuses."

Tristan gave a terse nod and left, heading straight to his office.

Minutes later, a knock sounded.

"Boss?" Jenna stood at his desk. "Patrick said you wanted to see me?"
###Chapter 187

Tristan Ashcroft's slender fingers tapped rhythmically on the solid wood desk.

His gaze remained fixed on Jenna Roland, lips pressed into a thin line as if holding back words.

Jenna shifted uncomfortably under his scrutiny. "Boss, just say what's on your mind."

Tristan took a deep breath. "You and Ethan Roscente... are friends?"

Jenna's pupils constricted briefly before she regained composure. "Why do you ask?"

Rubbing his temples, Tristan sighed. "Ethan specifically asked me to look after you. But now you've been hurt by Jake Varley..."

He hesitated. "Ethan isn't my main concern. It's Gavin Valentine. You know who he is."

Jenna frowned.

Ethan had actually told Tristan to protect her? That made no sense.

"When did this happen?" she pressed.

"Right after you started working here." Tristan's eyes darted away. "The problem now is keeping this from Ethan."

Suspicion clouded Jenna's thoughts.

Back then, she and Ethan had been on terrible terms. Why would he...

"But Mr. Valentine has already seen my injuries," she pointed out.

Tristan quickly responded, "I'll make sure he keeps quiet."

Jenna nodded. "Understood."

Lighting a cigarette, Tristan asked, "How will you explain these injuries?"

"A biking accident," Jenna said casually.

Tristan's eyes brightened. "Perfect excuse."

His tense shoulders finally relaxed. "You may go."

Jenna turned and left the office.

The moment the door closed, Tristan immediately dialed Gavin's number.

"She claims it was an accidental fall," he whispered urgently.

Satisfied laughter echoed through the receiver.

"Remember—don't let her get hurt again," Gavin warned.

"Yes, of course," Tristan agreed hastily.

Hanging up, he exhaled in relief.
###Chapter 188

The morning thunder startled Jenna Roland awake.

She blinked groggily as lightning flashed outside her window.

Grabbing her phone, she saw it was only nine.

Rolling over to sleep again, raindrops began hammering against the glass.

The storm intensified, sounding like it might shatter the panes.

With a sigh, Jenna got up and walked to the window.

Raindrops the size of peas formed silver streaks, turning the streets into shallow rivers.

Her afternoon trip to the business bureau would have to wait.

While preparing lunch after washing up, her phone rang.

The caller ID showed Attorney Hugo Valence.

"Attorney Valence."

"I'm at the business bureau. Your father's name? I'll check for you."

Jenna paused, surprised by his initiative.

"Victor Roland."

Hanging up, she tied on an apron and started cooking.

By eleven sharp, three dishes and soup were ready on the table.

The midday news played on TV.

Jenna glanced outside where the downpour showed no signs of stopping.

She debated calling Ethan Roscente.

Her phone vibrated—Grandma Blanche was calling.

"Good afternoon, Grandma."

"Have you eaten, Jenna?"

"Just finished cooking. Waiting for Mr. Roscente." Her voice softened. "Would you like to join us?"

"We've already eaten." The elderly woman's tone shifted. "How are things with Ethan?"

Jenna's ears warmed. "Quite well."

"Just 'quite well'?" The probing question carried weight.

"Mr. Roscente has helped me tremendously." She pressed her lips briefly. "When my brother's surgery funds fell short, his friend donated a million."

"Oh? Which friend?"

"Justin Kemnis. He works at the Red Cross."

Silence stretched for several seconds.

Grandma Blanche frowned deeply at her husband.

Justin Kemnis?

She distinctly remembered that young man being in import-export.
###Chapter 189

Grandma Blanche's hand trembled slightly as she held the phone, a shrewd glint flashing in her eyes.

Suddenly, she understood Ethan Roscente and Justin Kemnis's scheme.

"So Ethan was helping Jenna Roland all along!" The wrinkles around Grandma Blanche's eyes smoothed as she smiled.

"Justin really did make that Red Cross donation. Now Milo can have his surgery—what wonderful news!"

Jenna's cheerful voice came through the receiver. "We owe it all to them. The surgery would've been delayed for months otherwise."

"Milo's condition can't wait. The risks increase with every delay."

Grandma Blanche nodded vigorously. "When is the operation scheduled?"

"During his summer break—in two weeks."

"Focus on taking care of him then. Work can wait."

Jenna responded obediently. "Did you need something, Grandma?"

"I just wanted to check how things are going with Ethan." Grandma Blanche's tone turned affectionate. "I'm relieved to hear you're getting along well."

After hanging up, Grandma Blanche turned to Grandpa Harrison with a knowing smile. "The newlyweds are doing fine. We worried for nothing."

Grace Roscente took a delicate sip of tea. "Arranged marriages need time to adjust. Let them take it slow."

"I think Ethan's fallen for Jenna." Grandma Blanche dropped the bombshell.

Benjamin Roscente frowned. "What makes you say that, Mother?"

"He secretly arranged Milo's surgery funds!" Her eyes twinkled mischievously. "Had Justin pose as a Red Cross donor with a million-dollar contribution."

The living room erupted in murmurs.

Harrison's eyes lit up. "The boy finally developed some sense?"

"Would he go through such trouble if he didn't care?" Grace sniffed.

Grandpa Harrison clapped his hands. "This settles it—Yvonne Sherwood won't stand a chance now!"

At the mention of that name, Grandma Blanche's expression darkened. "But she was his first love for four years..."

"Then we'll see how much he truly loves Jenna," Benjamin said meaningfully.

Grace narrowed her eyes. "The marriage is legal. Yvonne can't interfere now."

"It's up to Jenna to prove herself." Grandma Blanche sighed.

Just then, a floral fragrance wafted through the air.

Sophie Roscente strode into the living room in stiletto heels. Her white sundress accentuated her porcelain skin as her red lips curved into a radiant smile.
###Chapter 190

Sophie Roscente had barely stepped through the front door when Benjamin Roscente's smile vanished.

His face darkened. "Sophie," he said coldly, "where were you partying last night?"

Sophie walked straight to Grandma Blanche and sat beside her, looping her arm through the elderly woman's.

She tilted her head at her father. "Dad, I'm your daughter. Must you use the word 'partying'?"

Benjamin slammed his hand on the table. "What else would you call it? You're in your twenties with no job, wasting time with those lowlifes at bars!"

Grace Roscente cut in sharply, "Where did you sleep last night?"

Grandma Blanche shot her son and daughter-in-law a disapproving look. "What's wrong with young people going to bars? It's not like she's committing crimes!"

Sophie's eyes lit up as she pulled a thermal container from her bag.

"Grandma, look what I brought you!"

She opened the box like presenting a treasure. The rich aroma of steamed dumplings filled the air.

"The last four dumplings from that alleyway shop. I waited in line for half an hour."

Grandma Blanche's eyes crinkled with delight as she accepted them. "My granddaughter is the most thoughtful."

Benjamin massaged his temples. "Mom, you're spoiling her rotten."

The old lady lifted her chin. "She's my only precious granddaughter. Who else should I spoil?"

Grace frowned. "Who would want to marry a girl who stays out all night?"

She remembered the constant complaints from Sophie's college advisor—how her daughter would sneak out past curfew to hit the clubs, always returning with heavy makeup and revealing outfits.

No amount of discipline changed Sophie's ways.

All because Grandma Blanche always took her side.

Sophie hugged the old woman's arm. "Grandmaaa~"

Grandma patted her hand. "Young people need to have fun. As long as she's not breaking laws."

Sophie immediately vowed, "I just drink with friends and always stay at Fiona's place. Nothing inappropriate."

The grandmother nodded approvingly. "See? My granddaughter knows her limits."

Sophie planted a kiss on Grandma's cheek. "Love you most!"

Grandma Blanche chuckled. "Go rest now."

Sophie bounded upstairs.

The moment she collapsed onto her bed, her phone rang.

Fiona Cortez's voice came through. "You're home? So... how was that hottie from last night?"
###Chapter 191

Sophie Roscente lounged lazily on her bed, twirling a strand of hair around her finger. "Last night's adventure?" She drawled, mischief glinting in her eyes.

Fiona Cortez gasped dramatically on the other end of the line. "Oh my god! Don't tell me you actually—"

"Stop right there." Sophie flipped onto her back. "What happens at Studio 54 stays at Studio 54. If Mom finds out, I'll be grounded for life."

"Since when have I ever ratted you out?" Fiona protested before changing the subject. "Speaking of which, how's your brother's whirlwind marriage going?"

Sophie snorted. "What do you think? It's a marriage of convenience."

She still couldn't fathom why her parents had disapproved of Ethan's relationship with Yvonne Sherwood, who came from a prominent family. Yet now they were treating Jenna Roland—a nobody with no connections—like royalty.

"You're so dense!" Fiona's voice rose an octave. "If your parents adore Jenna that much, get on her good side. She could be your golden ticket next time you're in trouble."

Sophie bolted upright, eyes sparkling with realization.

"Genius!" She laughed, slapping her thigh.

Fiona rolled her eyes audibly. "Honestly, is there room in that head for anything besides hot guys?"

"Time to butter up my new sister-in-law." Sophie's mind raced. Grandma Blanche was getting old—she needed someone influential to back her up when things got messy.

"I'm calling Ethan right now."

"Idiot!" Fiona cut in. "Do it in person if you want to make an impression."

Sophie bounced off the bed. "You're the best!"

She dashed downstairs and draped herself over Grandma Blanche's shoulder. "Grandma, can I have Jenna's address? I want to meet her."

Grace Roscente set her teacdown with a clatter. "What are you scheming now?"

"Mom!" Sophie rolled her eyes. "I'm not going to eat her alive. Can't family visit family?"

Grandma Blanche fretted. "Maybe start with a photo first?"

"Grandma!" Sophie's face fell. "You used to spoil me rotten. Now you won't even grant me this tiny favor?"

The old woman fell silent, flustered.

Grandpa Harrison rubbed his temples. "Let her go."

"Dad!" Benjamin Roscente stood abruptly. "You know how tactless she can be."

The realization hit Sophie like a ton of bricks—her entire family was guarding against her loose lips.
###Chapter 192

Sophie Roscente took a deep breath and raised three fingers. "Grandma Blanche, Grandpa Harrison, Mom Grace, Dad Benjamin—I swear I'll keep my mouth shut. If I spill the beans, you can freeze my credit cards and ground me for a month!"

She knew exactly what was at stake. The entire family had conspired to conceal Ethan's true identity when he married Jenna. One careless word from her could unravel everything.

Though usually mischievous, Sophie understood the gravity of this situation.

Grandma Blanche's expression turned stern. "Remember your promise. If your brother's marriage falls apart because of you, I'll deal with you first!"

Despite doting on her granddaughter, the old woman never compromised on principles.

"Got it~" Sophie chirped sweetly.

After receiving the Beverly Hills address, Grandma Blanche repeatedly warned her not to overstay.

Sophie agreed eagerly and skipped out the door.

Grace Roscente frowned. "Mom, are you sure about letting her go?"

"Relax." Grandma Blanche smiled knowingly. "Ethan will return home for lunch. That girl fears her brother more than anything. With him supervising, nothing will go wrong."

...

The red sports car pulled up in Beverly Hills.

Following the address, Sophie found the house and rang the doorbell.

Her smile froze when the door opened.

"Brother... Why are you here?"

Ethan Roscente blocked the doorway with a cold expression. "What are you doing here?"

Sophie twisted her fingers together. "I... I just wanted to meet my sister-in-law." She added hastily, "I promise to behave!"

Jenna Roland's voice carried from the dining room. "Mr. Roscente, who's at the door?"

Sophie's eyes lit up. Standing on tiptoes, she called out, "Sister-in-law, it's me!"

Ethan's face darkened instantly.

He'd planned to say it was a salesperson, but his sister had reacted too quickly.

Jenna appeared at the doorway, looking puzzled. "And you are...?"
###Chapter 193

Ethan stepped aside, his face darkening like a thundercloud.

His lips pressed into a tight line as he turned and walked inside without a word.

"Let's talk inside." Sophie beamed, stepping into the foyer where the aroma of food immediately greeted her.

She completely forgot to introduce herself, heading straight for the dining room. The sight of the table laden with Ethan's favorite dishes made her eyes light up.

"Jenna, did you make all this?" She turned to Jenna with delighted surprise.

In the Roscente household, their mother rarely cooked, leaving meals to the staff. Sophie had always admired women who could cook—a skill she could never master.

Jenna fidgeted slightly. "Yes, I did."

Sophie leaned over the table, inhaling deeply with an expression of pure bliss. "It smells amazing! You're so talented!"

"Would you like to join us? We were just about to eat," Jenna offered.

"Yes, absolutely!" Sophie agreed eagerly.

Jenna blinked. "Then... have a seat. I'll get the rice."

"I'll help!" Sophie chimed in, following her with honeyed words.

Ethan watched his sister's retreating figure, his brow furrowed.

In the past, he would've welcomed any distraction. But now, an inexplicable unease settled over him, fearing Sophie might say something wrong.

They returned to the dining room with bowls of rice.

Sophie immediately took her seat, greeting them before picking up her chopsticks.

Jenna handed Ethan his bowl. "Ethan, dinner's ready."

"Hmm." He took it without looking up.

Sophie gazed at her brother enviously. Getting to eat such delicious meals every day was pure happiness.

Midway through the meal, Jenna turned to Sophie. "By the way, I didn't catch your name?"

Sophie blinked. "I'm Sophie, Ethan's younger sister."

"So he has a sister." Jenna smiled lightly.

"We also have an older brother who's abroad," Sophie added.

Jenna's curiosity piqued. "Studying overseas? Your family must be well-off."

Sophie opened her mouth to reply when a sharp kick under the table silenced her. Meeting Ethan's warning glare, she quickly caught on.

"Actually... we're just average," she scrambled to improvise. "Our brother got sent abroad for training because of his outstanding work performance."

She shot Ethan a triumphant wink, as if seeking praise.

Jenna nodded. "Then your brother must be exceptional."
###Chapter 194

Sophie Roscente's lips curled into a mischievous smile. "But big brother still can't compare to Ethan. Ethan is..."

Before she could finish, Ethan's leather shoe connected sharply with her shin.

The kick was forceful enough to make Sophie nearly jump out of her seat.

She pouted in protest, certain she hadn't said anything wrong.

This tyrant didn't even spare his own sister from his brutality.

Jenna Roland immediately noticed the disturbance. "What happened?"

Rubbing her sore leg, Sophie quickly amended her statement. "I meant academically. Big brother never ranked first in school, but Ethan was the top of the top."

"Really?" Jenna's eyes brightened as she gazed at Ethan with newfound admiration. "No wonder Mr. Roscente became HM Group's director at such a young age. You're truly exceptional."

Ethan's stern expression softened slightly.

He cleared his throat. "Let's eat."

"Of course." Jenna nodded obediently before turning to Sophie. "You should eat more too."

"Thanks, sis!" Sophie cheerfully picked up a piece of braised pork. "Your cooking beats Michelin chefs. Did you train professionally?"

Jenna shook her head. "My mother was an excellent cook. I learned everything from her."

"It's in your blood!" Sophie praised between bites. "The sweet and sour ribs are perfectly seasoned."

Thanks to Sophie's unexpected visit, the four dishes and soup prepared for dinner were completely devoured.

Sophie wiped her mouth contentedly. "Sis, I really imposed on you today."

"Don't mention it." Jenna smiled warmly. "Next time just let me know in advance, and I'll prepare more of my specialties."

"Perfect!" Sophie immediately pulled out her phone. "Let's exchange contacts first."

As soon as they swapped numbers, Ethan abruptly stood up.

"Sophie, help clean up." He glanced at his watch. "I'm returning to the office."

Shortly after Ethan left, Sophie's phone vibrated.

The screen displayed a stark warning from Ethan: Watch your mouth.

Sophie rolled her eyes and tossed her phone aside, continuing to help Jenna clear the table.

After washing the dishes, Jenna thoughtfully brought over two cups of floral tea.

"Try this. It aids digestion." She placed a cup gently before Sophie.

"Thanks, sis!" Sophie accepted it with both hands. After taking a sip, her eyes lit up. "This is amazing!"
###Chapter 195

Ethan slid into the driver's seat but didn't start the engine. He pulled out his phone and dialed Grandma Blanche.

"Grandma, why did you give Sophie the address to Beverly Hills?" His voice was low and icy.

His long fingers tapped impatiently against the steering wheel, his brows furrowed. Sophie had never been good at keeping secrets. What if she accidentally let something slip to Jenna?

"She promised not to say anything," Grandma Blanche replied breezily.

"No matter what she promised, she shouldn't have gone to see Jenna." Ethan's tone darkened with displeasure.

"She said Jenna is her sister-in-law and they'd meet eventually." Grandma Blanche spoke unhurriedly. "Your grandfather and I both think it's time Jenna got to know the family, now that she's married into it."

Ethan took a deep breath and rubbed his temples. "Fine."

What was done couldn't be undone.

"Ethan, are you afraid Jenna will find out who you really are?" Grandma Blanche suddenly asked, a sly glint in her eyes.

"I have work to do. Goodbye." He abruptly ended the call.

Grandma Blanche huffed as she set down the phone. "That boy, still pretending with me!"

Grandpa Harrison chuckled. "Well?"

"The moment I asked if he liked Jenna, he hung up." She smirked triumphantly. "Definitely guilty."

"That girl is quite lovable," Grandpa Harrison nodded. "It's only natural Ethan would fall for her."

"I just hope they get together soon." Grandma Blanche beamed. "Then I can finally hold my great-grandchild."

......

Beverly Hills.

Jenna had just seen Sophie off and was about to rest when her phone rang. It was Hugo.

"Mr. Valence?" She answered.

"Miss Roland, we have results from the orchard investigation." His voice was grave. "It's already been transferred to your uncle's name. Legally, it'll be difficult to reclaim."

Jenna bolted upright in bed, her face instantly draining of color. "What?"

"The transfer was completed on May 4th, 2018," Hugo added.

The date made her hands tremble so violently she nearly dropped the phone.

"Miss Roland?" Hugo noticed her distress.

"My parents... died on April 29th, 2018," Jenna whispered, her voice shaking, eyes reddening.

"Which means..." Hugo paused.

"It was transferred less than a week after their deaths." Her fists clenched, nails digging into her palms. "Mr. Valence... do you think my uncle had something to do with their deaths?"
###Chapter 196

"Only he can tell you the truth."

"Attorney Valence, how should I investigate my parents' death?"

"Search your uncle's house, especially his study drawers. Any items related to your parents could be clues."

Jenna knew the odds were slim. If Uncle Victor was truly involved, the evidence was likely long gone.

"I understand."

"Focus on the condition of your parents' vehicle at the time of the accident, surveillance footage from the scene, and whether they had conflicts with anyone before their deaths."

"I'll do my best."

"Call me anytime."

After hanging up, Jenna tossed and turned. Memories of her parents and uncle haunted her.

Years ago, her parents' orchard thrived. Victor had demanded a stake but was refused. Out of family loyalty, her father still paid her cousins' tuition and taught Victor orchard management.

Then came the loan request—right when her father invested in a new orchard. The argument still echoed in her mind, Victor's enraged shouts accusing her father of heartlessness.

If their "accident" was really Victor's doing...

Jenna clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. She would uncover the truth and make the killer pay.

Tristan Ashcroft readily approved her leave request, clearly still guilty over the club incident.

Next, she called Victor Roland.

"Jenna? You dare call me?" His voice dripped with fury.

She inhaled deeply, suppressing the hatred rising in her throat.

"Uncle, I've realized something. After losing my parents, you're our only family. Milo and I are still young—we'll need your guidance. I was foolish before. Please forgive me."

A dull thud sounded—likely a shovel hitting dirt. Victor sneered, "You think an apology erases putting your aunt and cousins in detention?"
###Chapter 197

Victor Roland's knuckles turned white as he gripped his phone. How dare Jenna call to beg for forgiveness?

He wanted to strangle that insolent girl with his bare hands.

"I acted rashly. I shouldn't have caused such a scene." Jenna clenched her jaw so hard it ached, her nails digging into her palms.

The silence on the other end was deafening.

Jenna thought the call had dropped until she noticed the timer still counting.

"Out of respect for your parents," Victor finally spoke, his voice icy, "come apologize to your aunt and cousin in person. Then we'll consider this matter closed."

"Fine. I'll be there this afternoon."

Victor hung up without another word.

Determined to uncover the truth about her parents' accident, Jenna grabbed her things and sped toward her uncle's house on her e-bike.

At this hour, Heidi would be playing mahjong, Jason helping at the clothing store, and Victor tending his orchard.

Halfway there, her phone rang again.

"Buy groceries. You're cooking dinner." Victor's tone brooked no argument.

Jenna's culinary skills were legendary in the family. Even Victor had grown accustomed to her cooking during her absence.

"..."

Her face darkened like storm clouds.

That greedy bastard wouldn't miss any chance to exploit her.

"Understood." She ended the call before her rage could spill over.

After mentally cursing Victor a hundred times, Jenna turned toward the market.

Groceries in hand, she headed straight to the Roland residence.

Thankfully she'd kept her key after their last argument, saving a trip to the orchard.

The house stood empty as expected.

Jenna stored the groceries in the kitchen, then slipped into Victor's bedroom.

She rifled through nightstands and wardrobes with methodical precision.

Just as she was about to give up, a locked wooden chest caught her eye.

Buried under clothes, its brass padlock gleamed ominously.

Whatever hid inside must be damning.

Jenna remembered the keyring Victor always wore on his belt.

The front door lock clicked.

She shoved the chest back in place and grabbed an armful of dirty laundry just as—

"Jenna?" Jason stood frozen in the living room, his face twisting with fury. "You bitch! Who let you in here?"
###Chapter 198

Jason Roland was seething with rage. That bitch had gotten him and his mother detained for fifteen whole days! Those fifteen days had been pure hell—humiliated, bullied, wishing for death.

His hate-filled eyes burned into Jenna Roland.

"You deserved it," Jenna said coldly. "Extortion is a crime. Consider it a lesson."

Jason raised his fist, ready to strike.

"Go ahead," Jenna didn’t flinch. "I’d love to send you back for another two weeks."

Jason’s hand froze mid-air. The trauma of detention forced him to lower it.

"You’ll pay for this!" He pointed at her, teeth clenched.

Jenna ignored him, gathering a pile of dirty laundry before heading to the bathroom.

Jason cursed under his breath as he dialed Victor Roland. "Dad, why is she here?"

After listening to the explanation, his face twisted in disbelief. "She’ll apologize? Yeah, right!"

Hanging up, he smirked and gathered another heap of filthy clothes.

"Wash these!" He hurled them at Jenna’s feet.

"Why should I?"

"Then get the hell out of this house." Jason stormed off, slamming the door behind him.

Jenna stared at the toilet, a sinister smile creeping onto her lips.

"You asked for it." Without hesitation, she stuffed the clothes into the bowl.

In the living room, Jason lounged on the couch, cracking sunflower seeds and littering the floor with shells.

"Clean this up," he ordered without looking up.

Jenna gripped the broom, mentally cursing his entire bloodline.

The phone on the coffee table lit up—an incoming call from 10086.
###Chapter 199

Jenna Roland noticed the sudden glow of Jason Roland's phone screen. Her eyes narrowed as she read the caller ID. His expression darkened instantly.

He switched off the TV abruptly and strode toward the bedroom, gripping his phone.

Jenna arched a brow.

Since when did customer service calls require privacy?

She crept to the bedroom door, pressing her ear against it.

"Just got home. Remember that bitch I told you about? She's back."

"Who knows what she's scheming."

"Enough about her. Baby, did you miss me?"

"Good. See you soon."

Jenna slipped back to the living room and grabbed a broom, pretending to sweep.

A cold smirk curled her lips.

She'd come for evidence. This was an unexpected bonus.

Jason flung the door open and scoffed at the sight of Jenna cleaning. He marched past her without a word.

Jenna watched him change his shoes.

Off to meet his secret lover.

If Heidi Roland knew...

She dropped the broom and followed.

The elevator doors slid shut just as she arrived. Jenna jabbed the button for the next one.

In the lobby, Jason disappeared through the revolving doors. Jenna adjusted her cap and trailed behind.

At the curb, he ducked into a private car. She flagged down a taxi.

Twenty minutes later, a hotel sign loomed ahead.

Jenna waited until Jason entered the elevator before approaching the front desk.

"Which room did that gentleman take? I need the one next to his."

The receptionist eyed her skeptically. "And you are...?"

"His sister." Jenna feigned concern. "He's meeting some online fling. I'm worried he's being catfished."

After checking her ID, the clerk handed over a keycard.

Room 504.

The moment Jenna stepped inside, stiletto clicks echoed from next door.

Through the peephole, a woman in a skin-tight black dress swayed into 503.

Jenna snapped a photo.

Her lip curled in disdain.

Did Heidi know what trash her husband really was?

Pressing her ear to 503's door, Jenna heard nothing.

The soundproofing was annoyingly effective.
###Chapter 200

Jenna Roland clenched the voice recorder in her pocket, her fingertips trembling slightly.

She had hoped to capture some crucial conversations for future use. But given the current situation, her plan was falling apart.

She exhaled quietly and turned to leave.

......

When she returned to Victor Roland's house, the place was in complete disarray.

Jenna scanned the mess, a cold smirk curling her lips. If she wanted them to lower their guard, she might as well go all in.

Rolling up her sleeves, she began cleaning up the chaos.

By 4:30 PM, the aroma of cooking filled the kitchen.

At exactly 5:00, Heidi and Fiona Roland barged in. Their faces darkened the moment they saw Jenna.

"How dare you show your face here?" Fiona shrieked, her nails digging into her palms.

Jenna didn’t even glance up as she slammed the kitchen door shut.

Amid the roar of the exhaust fan, a glint of ice flashed in her eyes.

By 5:30, four dishes and a soup were laid out on the dining table.

Victor and Jason Roland had already taken their seats in the living room. Jenna went to fetch them one by one, as if serving royalty.

"You must be out of your mind!" Fiona threw her bag onto the table, rattling the dishes.

Victor picked up a piece of braised pork, then frowned. "Why aren’t you eating?"

"Not hungry." Jenna stood in the kitchen doorway, shadows masking half her face.

Heidi suddenly flung her chopsticks down. "Did you poison the food?"

The air turned frigid.

Jenna strode forward, grabbed a pair of chopsticks, and tasted every dish. She locked eyes with Heidi. "Satisfied?"

The sound of running water echoed from the bathroom.

Fiona shoveled rice into her mouth, teeth gritted. "She got us thrown in jail, and you—"

"Her cooking’s good," Victor smacked his lips. "And she cleaned the house."

Jason grinned. "Free help—why not use it?"

The three exchanged greedy glances.

"Not a cent less for rent and expenses!" Heidi suddenly raised her voice.

The conversation died as the doorknob turned.

Jenna emerged, hanging the last shirt to dry. She wiped her damp fingers on her apron. "Uncle Victor, I’m leaving."

Victor’s chopsticks froze mid-air. "You’re not staying?"
###Chapter 201

Jenna Roland's expression remained indifferent. "I'm not coming back."

The answer sent shockwaves through the room.

They had assumed her sudden goodwill meant she wanted to bring her burden of a brother home.

No one expected such a blunt refusal.

Victor Roland frowned deeply. "Then what's all this for?"

Jenna knew she needed a plausible excuse.

"I need to borrow money."

Before she could finish, mocking laughter erupted around her.

She was long accustomed to such cruel remarks.

Victor's voice turned grave. "We're expanding the orchard. No funds to spare."

"Not even thirty thousand?"

"No."

Jenna's gaze dropped to the keyring at his waist.

Among those many keys, one must unlock that mysterious wooden box.

She lifted her chin. "Then I'll do housework. A hundred a day."

Fiona Roland sneered. "Club earnings not enough?"

"Milo needs surgery."

Jenna met Victor's eyes squarely. "Call it charity."

The orchard had once belonged to Jenna's parents. After a tense pause, Victor gave a stiff nod.

"Fine."

Jenna turned to leave.

"Report to the orchard tomorrow for weeding," Victor added abruptly.

Her steps faltered slightly. The calculation was transparent.

The moment the door closed, Fiona exploded. "A hundred a day for housework? Have you lost your mind?"

Victor shot her a cold look. "If you didn't gamble daily, I wouldn't have agreed."

Jason Roland smirked. "Mom, we can just refuse payment at month's end."

Heidi Roland clapped excitedly. "Brilliant, darling!"

"Free labor—what a bargain." Jason preened.

Victor silently resumed eating, tacitly approving the scheme.

Fiona beamed. "Finally showing some sense!"
###Chapter 202

Jason Roland pouted and muttered unhappily, "Mom, is that really fair to say about me?"

...

When Jenna Roland returned to Beverly Hills, the night was already deep.

Only Milo Roland was in the living room.

Seeing Jenna back so early, Milo immediately ended his call, surprised. "Sis, you're not working today?"

Jenna sat on the couch, rubbing her sore neck. "I took the day off to visit Uncle Victor's place."

"What?"

Milo's eyes widened as he plopped down beside her. "Why would you go there? Did they give you any trouble?"

She couldn't tell him about their parents' murder yet—not before his surgery. He wouldn't be able to handle it.

Jenna kept her tone casual. "Attorney Hugo said Uncle Victor already transferred the orchard. To get it back, we need to find Mom and Dad's will."

"But didn't he burn it?" Milo frowned.

Jenna pressed her lips together. "Something that important? He wouldn't have actually destroyed it. What he burned that day must've been a fake."

"Oh." Milo's face lit with understanding. "So you went looking for the real one?"

"Yeah." Jenna picked up the remote. "I'll need to sneak into his house these next few days for a chance to search."

Milo burst out laughing. "You sound like a secret agent."

Jenna chuckled too. "Keep this between us."

Milo nodded emphatically. "Don't worry. My lips are sealed."

"Good." Jenna turned on the TV, then suddenly remembered. "Ethan's not back yet?"

"He usually comes home around eleven." Milo studied her. "Sis, have you eaten?"

"I grabbed something on the way." Jenna nodded.

"Then enjoy your show. I'm heading back to my game." Milo stood up.

Jenna hummed in acknowledgment.

Not long after Milo left, the doorbell rang.

Jenna checked the time with a frown—only 7:30 PM. Ethan never returned this early. Very few people knew she lived here. Who could it be?

"Who is it?" She approached the door.

"Me."

Ethan Roscente's cool voice came through.

Jenna froze, then quickly opened the door.

Seeing him standing there, she blinked in surprise. "Mr. Roscente, how—"

Ethan strode past her into the living room and took a seat on the couch. "The dinner meeting ended early."

"Oh." Jenna followed and sat down. "I thought you'd be back much later."

She hesitated. "Mr. Roscente... are you hungry?"

"...No." Ethan glanced at her before looking back at his phone.

Heat rushed to Jenna's ears—of course he wouldn't be hungry right after a business dinner. What a stupid question.

She bit her lip, gathering courage. "Mr. Roscente—"

Before she could continue, Ethan's brows drew together slightly. He met her gaze. "No need for formalities. Just call me Ethan."
###Chapter 203

Jenna's pupils constricted slightly. Her fingers unconsciously tightened around the hem of her blouse.

Ethan pulled a cigarette case from his suit pocket. The metallic click of his lighter echoed sharply in the quiet room. Wisps of pale smoke curled around his sharp features, making his hooded eyes appear even more unfathomable.

"Problem?" His deep voice rumbled as he exhaled a smoke ring.

Jenna shook her head hastily. "N-no."

Milo pushed open the door and froze at the sight of the man in the living room. "Mr. Roscente? No meetings today?"

"Finished early." Ethan tapped ash into the tray, his gaze fixed on the television screen.

Milo retreated into his room with practiced discretion. The click of the closing door sounded unnaturally loud in the silence.

The ashtray refracted light from the ceiling lamp. Ethan suddenly spoke. "New?"

"Pardon?" Jenna blinked.

"This." He rapped his knuckles against the glass vessel. "Your doing?"

The tips of Jenna's ears burned. "Last time I saw you flicking ashes into the flowerpot..."

Ethan stubbed out his cigarette without comment and stood. Silk fabric clung to his lean waistline as he disappeared into the master bedroom.

Only then did Jenna notice her damp palms. Three months of cohabitation, yet every private moment still felt like treading on thin ice.

Her phone vibrated. Tristan Ashcroft's name flashed on the screen.

"Can you report tomorrow?" Static distorted his voice.

Jenna bit her lip. "Mr. Ashcroft, I may need leave..."

"What?" Tristan's tone turned razor-sharp. "Your brother's surgery still needs $200k. Quitting now?"

"I found anomalies in my parents' crash footage." Her nails dug into her palms. "The autopsy shows cut brake lines."

Glass clinked on Tristan's end. He lowered his voice. "You're certain?"

"The medical examiner was my professor." Jenna glanced toward the master bedroom. "Keep this...from Mr. Roscente for now."
###Chapter 204

"Second, the acquired poison must fully merge and transform into innate poison."

"Finally, the most crucial step!" The Frostblade Immortal sighed heavily, his gaze solemn. "She must endure another heavenly thunder tribulation, like the one you faced yesterday. By all accounts, that was the weakest form of heavenly thunder."

"But..."

His eyes fell upon Ji Lin, flickering with pity. "Asking a newly ascended Divine Transformation cultivator like Ji Lin to withstand thunder capable of obliterating a Star Aperture Realm deity is sheer fantasy!"

"It would be like an egg striking a rock!"

"This is why, since the fall of the Innate Poison God three hundred millennia ago, no true innate poison physique has emerged. Even acquired poison physiques are rarer than fingers on one hand, and all perished before reaching maturity."

"Ji Lin's current condition..."

"She has at most a year left. There is another option—to place her in eternal slumber. But what difference is there between that and death?"

"Disciple, think carefully. She must face the heavenly thunder alone. If you interfere, its power will double. The power of the Cycle Graveyard is finite—it may block one strike, but not necessarily a second."

"Moreover, yesterday's thunder was only the first of the contract."

"The true heavenly tribulation consists of three strikes, each more terrifying than the last..."

Ye Chen fell into deep contemplation.

Heavenly thunder!

He had experienced it twice. The first was during the alchemy tribulation in Danxu Town when refining an Emperor Realm pill—its power equivalent only to a mid-stage Emperor Realm strike. Kunlun Void was a lower martial world with limited heavenly law, capping at the combined Dao Realm's might.

But the Spirit Martial Continent was different!

This was an upper martial world where heavenly thunder rivaled the full-force strike of a Void Transcendence Saint. Unless he possessed saintly cultivation, resistance was impossible.

As for the second time...

It was the heavenly punishment for violating a heavenly contract. Three thunder strikes—the first equivalent to a third-layer Star Aperture Realm strike, the second to a sixth-layer, and the third nearing the ninth-layer!

Three heavenly thunder strikes!

Throughout history, those who survived could be counted on one hand!

At his current strength, without the Cycle Graveyard's aid, death was certain!

"No!"

"Ji Lin is Siqing's sister. She helped me so much in the past—I won't let her become a living corpse!"

"What's heavenly thunder? I've shattered two tribulations already—a third means nothing!" Ye Chen's gaze hardened as he looked at the Frostblade Immortal and the six divine buddhas and sovereigns. "Masters, since the Innate Poison God succeeded, there must be a method."

"Could there be..."

"A powerful array to weaken the thunder?"

"An array?" The Frostblade Immortal frowned. "Arrays could work, but..."

The Eternal Blood Demon Array?

The Heaven-Surveying Earth-Inquiring Array?

The Universe-Sealing Demon Array?

...

None would suffice!

Their power was insufficient to withstand heavenly thunder.

Unless a peerless expert presided over them—at least a Star Aperture Realm deity. But such experts were more likely to kick you when you're down than lend aid. The cost of their assistance would rival a divine artifact!

Divine artifacts!

A single divine artifact's value exceeded ten spacetime weapons!

Ye Chen couldn't afford it. Neither could they.

"An array!"

"Grave Keeper, I've just recalled something!" The Nine Dances Sovereign suddenly spoke. "In Kunlun Void's resource-scarce past, arrays often drew power from mountain and earth veins. Such arrays could transcend realms to resist powerful enemies."

"Like the Universe Dragon Array!"

"Deployed by Chaos Unity Realm cultivators, it could briefly withstand a ninth-layer Combined Dao Sovereign's attack!"

The Universe Dragon Array!

Ye Chen's eyes lit up.

Back then, leading Kunlun Void and Spirit City's factions, he gathered ninety Divine Transformation cultivators to form this array, barely holding off a late-stage Divine King Realm Blood Spirit clansman. Only the intervention of a Soul Clan Combined Dao elder shattered it.

"Feasible!"

"The Spirit Martial Continent's mountains and earth veins contain dragon pulses."

"Dragon pulses nurture earth qi, forming earth dragons. If we can connect the dragon pulse's earth qi with an array, supplemented by spacetime weapons and Combined Dao artifacts, we might withstand the thunder!"

Ye Chen's mind raced.

Such heaven-and-earth-powered arrays were exceedingly rare. Fortunately, Kunlun Void's ancient Star Aperture experts left behind such legacies.

His plan: eight spacetime weapons occupying the eight trigrams, fifty Combined Dao artifacts forming the Five Elements Grand Array. After dual weakening, the thunder's power might drop to the Chaos Unity Realm level.

Then...

He could use the Cycle Graveyard to mask his aura, entering the array to endure the thunder for Ji Lin. Once he helped her fully merge the Thousand Demon Ginseng, she would awaken with an innate poison physique!

"This method..."

"Isn't impossible, but the risks are extreme!"

"The slightest misstep could mean your demise, Grave Keeper!" The Frostblade Immortal spoke after a long silence. He wanted to dissuade him but found no grounds.

"Demise?"

"The heavenly law can't claim me!"

"Nor can the grand dao—nothing in this world can take my life!"

Ye Chen stared at the unconscious Ji Lin, his voice resolute. "I will never let my people become living corpses. Never. This array will be deployed!"

The Frostblade Immortal looked up, studying Ye Chen with unfamiliar eyes.

This disciple...

Was too stubborn, stubborn to the point of obsession!

In Ye Chen's eyes, nothing was impossible, no obstacle insurmountable.

And in truth, he had repeatedly forged miracles.
###Chapter 205

The Wanlong territory originally belonged to Quentin Croix. Wilson Parvis was just a lowly underling back then.

Who could've imagined that after Quentin's death, Wilson would rise to power and become Wanlong's new overlord overnight?

Rumors said Wilson commanded tens of thousands of elite soldiers. His influence was so formidable that even the infamous Vincent Agrigent dared not cross him lightly.

Tristan Ashcroft was stunned. He never expected Tony Lombardi to be Wilson's son-in-law!

"Exactly. He's my father-in-law." Tony swirled his wine glass. "Without him, I wouldn't be where I am today."

Tristan raised his glass for a toast.

After downing his drink, he said meaningfully, "Then you'd better tread carefully. If your wife gets upset..."

Tony gave a bitter laugh. "Tell me about it. Her pregnancy hormones are raging these days. I can't even breathe too loudly around her."

"Good luck with that." Tristan checked his watch and stood. "I've got business to attend to. Excuse me."

"Go ahead." Tony waved him off, watching him leave.

......

Jenna Roland stepped into the bedroom, drying her damp hair. Ethan Roscente leaned against the headboard, reading.

She sat at the vanity and picked up her old jar of Dabao moisturizer.

Ethan's gaze lifted from his book, landing on the cheap skincare product in her hands. His brows furrowed.

"Why aren't you using the skincare set I bought you?"

Jenna applied the cream while facing the mirror. "I'll switch after finishing this one."

"And the clothes in the wardrobe—you've never worn them." His voice turned icy.

He'd personally selected those haute couture dresses, even removing the tags himself. Yet they remained untouched.

After moisturizing, Jenna walked to the bed. "Those outfits are too expensive. I do housework all day—it'd be wasteful to wear them."

Ethan's expression froze.

He couldn't believe his ears.

"Clothes are meant to be worn." His tone was glacial. "If you won't wear them, I'll have them tossed tomorrow."

Hearing his anger, Jenna quickly relented. "I'll wear them tomorrow. Don't be mad."

Ethan snorted and turned away.

Jenna silently arranged her floor bedding. After scrolling through her phone, drowsiness soon overtook her.

She set the phone aside and fell into deep sleep.
###Chapter 206

Jenna Roland soon fell into a deep slumber, her breathing steady and even.

Ethan Roscente turned slightly, quickly sending two messages before his gaze inadvertently drifted to the figure on the floor bedding.

Jenna shifted unconsciously, turning her back to him.

The movement caused the thin summer blanket to slip halfway down, revealing the smooth curve of her back and the delicate dip of her waist.

The slender contour glowed softly under the moonlight.

Ethan's throat tightened as his eyes remained fixed on that pale expanse of skin.

Jenna frowned suddenly, scratching her neck before rolling onto her back again.

Her exquisite face now faced him directly, the moonlight tracing her flawless profile.

His gaze traveled downward, where a dozen red scars marred the porcelain skin of her neck.

Ethan's brow furrowed.

He remembered her skin being flawless the last time he saw her.

Further down, the tantalizing curves made his mouth go dry, his breathing growing ragged.

He squeezed his eyes shut, taking several deep breaths.

This was madness. How could he be having these thoughts about Jenna?

Too long without release, apparently.

Irritated, he switched off the bedside lamp.

Moonlight filtered through the curtains, illuminating her silhouette even more vividly.

The narrow waist, the flat stomach, and the suggestive curves hidden beneath the blanket.

Unwanted fantasies flooded his mind.

His pulse quickened, heat spreading through his body.

A sudden phone ringtone snapped him out of his trance.

Damn it. How long had he been staring at her?

Ethan muted the call instantly.

Gavin Valentine's name flashed on the screen.

Pinching the bridge of his nose, he stepped onto the balcony, closing the glass door before answering.

"Speak."

His voice came out rough and strained.

"I'm at Studio 54. Tristan Ashcroft says Jenna didn't show tonight." Gavin's voice crackled through the line. "And she's only working two-hour shifts from now on. Should I keep monitoring her?"

Ethan's gaze drifted back through the glass door.

Somehow, Jenna had kicked off the blanket completely, now lying fully exposed toward him.

Moonlight bathed every alluring curve in silver.

He forced himself to look away.

"Ethan? You there?" Gavin's voice pulled him back.

"What?" His reply was hoarse.
###Chapter 207

"Bright red blood?" Huang Rong frowned slightly, studying Yang Guo's swollen black palm with suspicion. She retrieved a Nine-Flower Jade Dew Pill from her embroidered pouch and handed it to him. "Chew and swallow it."

Yang Guo took the pill and bit down. A refreshing sweetness instantly filled his mouth. The cooling medicinal energy flowed down his throat to his dantian, spreading comfort throughout his body. He marveled inwardly—the legendary Peach Blossom Island's remedy truly lived up to its reputation.

"Thank you, Aunt Guo." Yang Guo's eyes sparkled with an innocent smile. "My mother always said you were the most beautiful and brilliant woman in the world. Seeing you today, I know she wasn't exaggerating."

Huang Rong froze. Since when had Mu Nianci spoken of her like that? Then she realized—this sly boy must have inherited his father's silver tongue. A faint smile touched her lips. "Your mother flatters me too much."

Guo Jing suddenly tensed, scanning their surroundings. "That demoness must be nearby." He threw back his head and let out a thunderous roar that shook the air. Willow branches trembled, and birds scattered in alarm.

Though Yang Guo knew the plot, the sheer force of the roar still sent a jolt through his heart. Guo Jing's internal energy was far more profound than he'd imagined. The sound waves layered upon each other like the thunder of ten thousand horses charging.

Not to be outdone by her husband, Huang Rong gathered her qi and released a clear, melodious roar. Her cry intertwined with Guo Jing's mighty bellow, soaring into the heavens like a phoenix's song meeting a dragon's roar.

After years of rigorous training on Peach Blossom Island, the couple's internal energy had reached perfection. Though Huang Rong's strength couldn't match Guo Jing's, her technique was far more agile and versatile. Their combined roars carried for miles.

Yang Guo suppressed a laugh. In the original story, these roars had scared away both Huang Yaoshi and Ouyang Feng. Even Li Mochou had retreated in despair. Today's performance was likely wasted effort.

He stole a glance at Huang Rong and noted the lingering suspicion in her brow. This sharp-witted aunt wasn't easily fooled. His earlier flattery probably hadn't dispelled her wariness.

A faint rustle came from distant treetops, as if someone had fled. Yang Guo narrowed his eyes—Li Mochou had indeed been frightened off by the roars. His fingers brushed against the Five Venoms Secret Manual hidden in his robe as he plotted his next move.

Guo Jing ceased roaring, his thick brows furrowed. "Strange. No one answered the challenge."

Huang Rong gently touched his arm. "Perhaps the demoness knew she was outmatched."

Suddenly, Yang Guo clutched his arm with a pained expression. Huang Rong's sharp gaze bore into him, as if seeing through his act. The boy's heart sank—this brilliant aunt was far too perceptive to deceive.
###Chapter 208

"Furong, mind your words from now on." Guo Jing's tone had softened, but the sternness in his brow remained.

Guo Furong secretly exhaled in relief and quickly replied, "I'll remember, Father."

Footsteps approached from nearby as Ke Zhen'e led Guo Furong through the grove.

The moment Guo Furong spotted Huang Rong, she rushed into her mother's arms, cooing like a spoiled child.

As she prattled on with trivial chatter, Guo Jing's frown deepened.

Afraid of her father's reprimand, Guo Furong's eyes darted around before suddenly pointing at Yang Guo. "Hey, you! Go pick some flowers to make me a wreath!" She glimpsed his soiled sleeves and shabby clothes, curling her lip in disdain. "Never mind. You're filthy. You'd just stink up the flowers."

Guo Jing's expression darkened instantly.

But Yang Guo merely lowered his head, forcing a weak smile. "You're right. I am dirty. The flowers would get dirty too. If I soiled your new dress, you'd be cross with me again."

As he spoke, he took two steps back, his fingers unconsciously plucking at his frayed hem. His eyes reddened slightly, the very picture of a pitiful, mistreated boy.

In the original tale, Yang Guo would have been deeply wounded by Guo Furong's words—sensitive and insecure. But this Yang Guo was no longer that helpless youth who took abuse meekly.

Dealing with a spoiled, simple-minded young mistress like Guo Furong required neither defiance nor submission.

Yang Guo studied the girl before him. She wore a delicate green silk dress, pearls gleaming at her throat, her skin so fair it seemed one could pinch water from it. Her almond-shaped eyes sparkled with mischief beneath arched willow-leaf brows.

'Pretty enough,' he mused inwardly, amused. 'Just not very bright.' Such naive girls were always the most entertaining to tease, reminding him of simpler days.

"At least you know your place," Guo Furong scoffed, tilting her chin up proudly, completely missing the sarcasm lacing his words.

Huang Rong sighed inwardly. Her daughter had inherited none of her wit—a beautiful fool through and through.

She shot Yang Guo a knowing glance, recognizing how his carefully chosen words would ignite Guo Jing's temper.

Sure enough, Guo Jing misinterpreted Yang Guo's feigned meekness as habitual cowardice. His fury erupted instantly.
###Chapter 209

Morning light filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the dining table. Ethan Roscente set down his coffee cup, his gaze lingering on Jenna Roland across from him.

She wore the white dress he'd carefully selected, her dark hair casually tied into a bun. The morning light illuminated her bare face, giving her an ethereal glow.

"It suits you," Ethan murmured, his voice deep.

Jenna glanced at the hem of her dress, a faint smile touching her lips. "Thank you."

She hadn't wanted to wear it, but the displeasure in Ethan's eyes last night had changed her mind.

"Urgent matter at the office." Ethan rose. "You handle the dishes. I'll take care of lunch."

"I'm cooking at Uncle Victor's place these afternoons," Jenna explained.

Ethan grabbed his phone and left without another word.

After Milo Roland rushed out with his backpack, Jenna began clearing the table. As she dried the last plate, she realized she'd never seen Ethan's dirty laundry.

"Maybe he sends it to the dry cleaners," she muttered. "What a waste. I should tell him I can do it."

Just as she finished hanging the laundry, Victor Roland's call came through.

"Why aren't you at the orchard yet?" His voice was sharp.

"On my way." Jenna snatched her keys and dashed out.

At the orchard, Victor was bent over, pulling weeds. He straightened when he spotted his tardy niece, his expression darkening.

"Slacking off again?" he demanded.

Jenna lowered her head. "I stayed up late."

"If not for your father, who'd pay you for this?" Victor scoffed.

Jenna's gaze flickered to the jingling keys at his waist before she silently moved to the field's edge and knelt.

They worked in silence amid the overgrown orchard. After ten minutes, Victor suddenly spoke.

"Heard you got married. Living with him now?"

"Divorced already." Jenna kept her eyes on the weeds. "Milo and I rent our own place."
###Chapter 210

Jenna Roland had just announced her divorce when Victor Roland let out a piercing sneer.

"I knew this would happen!" He shot her a sideways glance. "What wealthy man would ever want a woman like you?"

Jenna clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

She forced herself not to react.

Victor's disdainful gaze cut through her like a blade.

Just then, his phone rang.

"What?" he answered impatiently.

Fiona Roland's excited voice came through. "Victor, remember Daisy Dimucci?"

"That fat woman?" Victor frowned. "What about her?"

Fiona lowered her voice. "She knows a wealthy businessman looking for pretty girls to spend the night with. If it's their first time, he pays eighty thousand!"

Victor's head snapped toward Jenna.

She was bent over weeding the vegetable garden, her slender waist catching the sunlight.

"Eighty thousand?" He swallowed hard. "You're sure?"

"Absolutely!" Fiona urged. "Jenna's so beautiful—he might pay even more!"

Victor's greedy eyes locked onto Jenna's back.

"She'd never agree," he muttered.

"That's why we need a plan!" Fiona insisted. "Be nice to her these next few days. Don't let her suspect anything."

Hanging up, Victor immediately plastered on a smile.

"Jenna," he cooed, approaching her. "Your aunt won big at mahjong. She's treating us to lunch."

Jenna didn't look up. "Milo's going to a friend's house."

"Then we'll bring him something delicious," Victor said eagerly.

Jenna eyed him suspiciously.

Her usually cruel uncle's sudden warmth set off alarm bells in her mind.

At eleven, Fiona called again.

"Reservation's ready. Let's go." Victor hung up, rubbing his hands together.

Jenna followed in silence.

In the parking lot, Victor opened the car door for her. "Ride with me."

After a pause, Jenna slid inside.

The black sedan pulled away, heading toward an unknown destination.
###Chapter 211

Jenna Roland entered the private room arm-in-arm with her father Victor Roland. Fiona Roland and her family were already seated around the round table.

"Jenna's here!" Fiona beamed with exaggerated warmth.

Jason and Heidi immediately stood up, pulling out a chair for her with excessive courtesy.

Jenna's brows furrowed slightly. Alarm bells rang in her mind.

These people usually greeted her with either cold sarcasm or outright indifference. Their sudden hospitality reeked of ulterior motives.

Heidi poured her a cup of black tea with exaggerated care.

Jenna tapped the rim of the cup lightly before meeting Fiona's flushed face. "Had good luck at the tables, Aunt Fiona?"

"Just a small win." Fiona's grin stretched ear to ear. "Only about ten grand."

Jenna smirked inwardly.

For this compulsive gambler, winning five figures was indeed cause for celebration.

The door swung open as Sean Roland strode in with his long legs.

"Sean?" Jenna stood up in surprise.

He took the seat beside her without ceremony. "Dad mentioned Aunt Fiona was treating. I happened to be free."

Victor glanced around. "Have we ordered yet?"

"Already taken care of." Fiona suddenly changed the subject. "Jenna, I heard you got married recently?"

Jenna nodded calmly. "Already divorced."

She braced for the expected snide remarks, but was met with unusual silence.

Fiona forced a chuckle. "Young people have plenty of opportunities."

Heidi leaned forward eagerly. "Did you two... live together?"

"No." Jenna eyed her suspiciously.

Fiona and Heidi exchanged a look of barely concealed delight.

This answer clearly pleased them immensely.

Waiters began serving the meal. Jenna's lips curled at the meager spread.

For a restaurant famed for seafood, only a single sea bass graced the table.

Sean suddenly stopped a departing waiter. "Do you have lobster?"

"Yes, sir." The waiter bowed slightly. "We have both Australian lobster and Caribbean spiny lobster available."
###Chapter 212

Fiona Roland's heart lurched violently, her fingernails digging into her palms without conscious thought.

She forced composure as she waved at the waiter. "That will be all for now."

The waiter bowed and retreated, leaving the private dining room in eerie silence.

Jenna Roland tapped her chopsticks twice against her bowl before speaking abruptly. "Uncle Victor, you still have my parents' suicide note, don't you?"

Victor Roland froze mid-bite, his chopsticks suspended in air. Deep furrows appeared between his brows. "Why bring this up now?"

"Just occurred to me." Jenna poked at her rice. "Five years ago you claimed to have burned it. But something never added up."

Victor's expression darkened as he set down his chopsticks and wiped his mouth. "Why dredge up ancient history?"

"Suicide notes..." Jenna lifted her gaze to meet his directly, "are written by people expecting to die. My parents died in a car crash. When would they have had time to write one?"

Fiona's soup spoon clattered into her bowl.

Victor's temple vein bulged. "What exactly are you implying?"

"Take it literally." Jenna's smile turned icy. "My brother verified the handwriting. It wasn't our father's. And we all know who benefited."

Victor slammed the table. "Preposterous! That note was in your father's bedroom! I never had access to your house keys!"

"What about the orchard then?" Jenna pressed relentlessly. "Why was it secretly transferred to your name?"

Sean Roland gaped at his father. "Dad...is this true?"

"You know nothing!" Victor snapped before forcing a conciliatory smile at Jenna. "You'll marry eventually. We couldn't let the orchard go to outsiders..."

Jenna clenched her fists until her nails drew blood. The surveillance footage of her parents still lay in her bag. Tonight's performance had only just begun.
###Chapter 213

Jenna Roland clenched her fists, nails digging deep into her palms.

She would marry someday, but not now.

That orchard was her parents' legacy. She and her brother Milo were the rightful heirs. Why should they hand it over to Victor Roland, an outsider?

"Milo can't manage the orchard because of his health?" Jenna scoffed. "If not for your interference, the orchard would've been mine years ago!"

Victor lounged with his legs crossed, smug. "Your parents died young. Without my hard work, the orchard would've gone to waste. You should be thanking me."

His words ignited Jenna's fury.

"The will clearly states the orchard returns to me upon marriage," she shot up from her seat. "How dare you go back on your word?"

"Naive!" Victor slammed the table. "After all my effort, you think I'd walk away empty-handed? The orchard is under my name now. Forget about reclaiming it!"

Fiona Roland kicked Victor under the table, shooting him a venomous glare.

"What's wrong with you?" Victor yelped in pain.

Fiona gritted her teeth. They were supposed to coax Jenna, but this idiot had ruined everything. The $80,000 reward was slipping through their fingers.

"Where's the will?" Jenna demanded.

"Burned it," Victor sneered. "You saw it yourself."

Jenna's heart sank.

She had wanted to verify the handwriting. But if the will was forged, Victor would've destroyed the evidence.

That mysterious wooden box was her only hope now.

In the past, she would've stormed out. But for the truth, she had to endure.

"Dad," Sean Roland spoke up, "the orchard never belonged to you. Return it to Jenna and Milo."

Victor was about to explode when Fiona kicked him again.

"Enough! We're here to eat, not argue!" Fiona snapped.

Heidi Roland quickly mediated. "We're family. Let's not fight."

Jenna silently finished her meal, then looked up. "You're right. The orchard should be yours."

"What?" Victor gaped.

"You've managed it for years. You understand it better than I do." Jenna forced a smile, swallowing her disgust. "I won't take it back."

Victor froze.

He knew better than anyone how far Jenna would go to reclaim the orchard—even marrying a stranger.
###Chapter 214

Jenna's gaze lingered on the keychain at Victor's waist.

"Still going to weed the orchard this afternoon?" she asked abruptly.

Victor froze.

They'd just been arguing heatedly moments ago. Now she was asking about gardening?

What game was this girl playing?

Fiona smoothed things over with a smile. "The sun's too intense now. Let's wait till it cools down."

"Then I'll take my leave." Jenna stood and walked out without another word.

Sean hurried after her.

Once they were out of earshot, Fiona's pleasant expression twisted into fury.

"Victor!" she hissed through clenched teeth. "You almost ruined everything!"

Victor snorted. "I can't stand her smug face."

"Eighty thousand dollars!" Fiona lowered her voice. "We might even squeeze out more. But if you scare her off, we get nothing!"

She glared at her husband. "You will control yourself until that money's in our hands!"

The mention of money finally subdued Victor.

......

Outside the restaurant, Sean caught up with Jenna.

"I never thought he'd secretly transfer the orchard's ownership," he said bitterly.

Jenna gave a humorless laugh. "There's plenty you don't know."

"You think the will was forged?" Sean frowned.

"The sole beneficiary being him? Highly suspicious," Jenna said flatly.

Sean shook his head. "Knowing my father, he'd seize the orchard with or without a will. I doubt he even wrote it."

"Then who did?" Jenna stopped abruptly.

"If we find the will, I can verify if it's his handwriting," Sean offered.

Jenna bit her lip. "Even if we find it, Milo said the signatures don't match."

"You're planning to use it in court?" Sean looked startled.

"A genuine will would force him to return the orchard," Jenna sighed. "Too bad it's fake."

Sean gave a pained smile. "If only your father were still—"

"If he were alive, your father wouldn't have gotten his hands on that orchard," Jenna cut in coldly.

The will was just a pretext anyway.

What she truly sought was the truth behind her parents' deaths.

That wooden box held too many secrets.

She had to get those keys.
###Chapter 215

Jenna Roland leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. Her piercing gaze locked onto Sean Roland. "Big brother, have you ever seen Dad's carved wooden box?"

Sean paused while organizing documents. He looked up, confused. "What box?"

Since graduating college, he'd moved out of the Roland family home.

The old house was too small. If he returned, Jenna and Milo would have to share a room. Over the years, he'd preferred renting near the company rather than going back.

A flicker of disappointment crossed Jenna's eyes before she forced a casual smile. "Never mind. I just saw it while cleaning the closet. Thought it looked unique."

She'd lived in the Roland house for five years and never once spotted that box.

Victor Roland must have hidden it deliberately. Only after she moved out did that old fox dare to leave it in plain sight.

"Should I ask for you?" Sean closed the file folder.

"No!" Jenna waved her hands hastily. "If Uncle Victor finds out I'm asking, he'll accuse me of meddling again."

Sean considered this and dropped the subject. He grabbed his car keys. "Where to? I'll drive you."

"The orchard." Jenna slung her backpack over her shoulder.

Sean nodded and led her to the parking lot. He opened the car door for her like a gentleman, waiting until she buckled up before starting the engine.

"It's scorching today. Didn't we agree you'd skip the orchard?" Sean glanced at the blinding sunlight outside.

Jenna stared at the scenery whipping past the window. "Just checking on things. Not working."

"How much longer at the club?" Sean asked abruptly.

Jenna turned to him, lips curving slightly. "Two more weeks. I'll quit once I've saved enough."

"Better leave sooner." Sean kept his eyes on the road. "That place isn't for you."

Jenna gave a soft "Mm."

She'd only taken the club job to pay for Milo's surgery. Now that her brother's treatment was secured, she couldn't wait to get out.

The car stopped at the mountain's base. Sean turned to her. "Call me if you need anything."

"Got it." Jenna waved as the car drove off.

Once the taillights vanished around the bend, she faced the lush orchard. Under the blazing sun, her eyes burned hotter than the daylight.

"Dad... Mom..." she whispered. "I will uncover the truth."

The orchard stood empty at noon. Jenna found a shady spot beneath a dense fruit tree and waited silently.

At 3 PM, Victor's figure finally appeared on the mountain path.

Jenna stood immediately, pretending to prune branches. By 4 PM, she wiped her sweat and approached Victor. "Uncle, I lost my keys. Can I borrow yours?"

Victor frowned. "How?"

"Probably dropped them on my way down." Jenna feigned innocence. "I searched everywhere."

Victor's face darkened, but remembering Fiona's warnings, he suppressed his anger. Slowly, he unhooked the keyring from his belt—

Jenna's heartbeat spiked. A thin layer of sweat coated her back.
###Chapter 216

Victor Roland's slender fingers flicked through the keychain. He detached a single brass key and handed it to her.

Jenna Roland stared at the solitary key, surprise flickering in her eyes.

She had expected the entire set.

"Thanks." Her expression remained neutral as she accepted the cold metal.

"I'll go grocery shopping first."

Victor gave a curt nod, his attention already returning to the documents in his hands.

Descending the hill, Jenna tightened her grip around the key.

Getting the full set wouldn't be that easy.

She could wait a day or two. But weeks? No patience for that.

The mountain breeze lifted her hair. Suddenly, her eyes brightened.

A brilliant idea flashed through her mind.

The market buzzed with noise.

Jenna returned to the Roland residence with a heavy basket of groceries, her steps light.

Pushing open the door, she found only Jason Roland in the living room.

The teenager was curled on the couch gaming, not even glancing up.

"Dinner's ready." Jenna set down the basket. "I'm leaving now."

Jason grunted, his fingers smashing the game controller buttons.

Outside, Jenna stopped at a street vendor for a bowl of beef noodles.

The neon lights of Studio 54 glowed vividly in the night.

"Jenna!" Chloe Blanchet rushed over, grabbing her arm. "Something terrible happened!"

Jenna frowned. "What?"

"Jake Varley attacked Stella Laurent with his gang!" Chloe whispered urgently. "The video's gone viral. You haven't seen it?"

Jenna's pupils constricted.

"When?"

"This afternoon!" Chloe pulled out her phone. "Here, watch."

The footage showed Jake and several thug-like men vandalizing Stella's shop.

Jenna's heart plummeted.

"I'm calling Stella."

The first call went unanswered.

The second rang endlessly before a stranger picked up.

"Hello?" A tired female voice.

"This is Jenna Roland, Stella's friend. Is she there?"

"I'm her sister, Sylvia." Exhaustion laced the reply. "She just fell asleep."

Medical equipment beeped in the background.

"How badly is she hurt?"

"That bastard!" Sylvia's voice suddenly sharpened. "When I get my hands on him—"

A nurse's warning cut her off.

Jenna quickly got the hospital address and hung up.

Chloe leaned in. "Well?"

"At the hospital." Jenna's face paled. "It was definitely Jake."
###Chapter 217

Jenna Roland and Chloe Blanchet were fully aware that Jake Varley had brought people to beat Stella Laurent. The day Jake came looking for trouble with Stella, he ended up being taught a lesson by Tristan Ashcroft's men. To make matters worse, the secret stash of money he'd been saving was stolen by Stella right under his nose.

Jake couldn't swallow this humiliation.

"If I'd known he'd retaliate, I would've told them to beat him harder that day," Jenna said through gritted teeth.

Chloe sighed. "When are you planning to visit Stella?"

"Not today. I have work." Jenna glanced at her watch. "Tomorrow, maybe. It's too late after my shift."

"Alright, call me tomorrow." Chloe nodded.

Jenna turned to change in the locker room. Chloe followed and suddenly lowered her voice. "Speaking of revenge... Sophia Merouin hasn't caused you any trouble since she quit, has she?"

Jenna paused mid-motion.

"She had someone follow me," Jenna said, buttoning her blouse. "The boss found out. That night, Sophia and her lackey were taken away by his men."

Chloe gasped.

"She actually—" Chloe paled. "Thank God the boss stepped in."

Jenna smirked coldly. "She thought there was something between me and the boss. That's why she went crazy."

"So... you and the boss—" Chloe wiggled her eyebrows suggestively.

"Don't even go there!" Jenna shoved her clothes into the locker with force. "We're just employer and employee."

Chloe pouted. "You're gorgeous. It's normal if he's attracted to you."

Jenna shot her a stern look. "Don't spread rumors. That kind of talk helps no one."

They stepped out of the locker room, and Jenna was immediately called away by a client.

The club was unusually busy tonight. With her sweet looks and sharp social skills, Jenna had built a loyal clientele. She barely had time to catch her breath before midnight arrived.

Tristan had promised to let her leave by eleven, but it was already past twelve when Jenna finally got a break.

"The boss wants to see you," a server informed her.

Smoothing her dress, Jenna knocked on Tristan's office door.

"Have a seat." Tristan gestured to the chair across from him.

Jenna closed the door behind her, anxiety creeping in. "Boss, what did you need?"
###Chapter 218

Tristan Ashcroft held a cigarette between his slender fingers, the smoke curling around him as he lounged lazily in his leather chair. His deep gaze settled on Jenna Roland as his thin lips parted. "Some things are better discussed in person. Jenna, you know how much I value you."

He exhaled a slow ring of smoke. "Stay. Name your terms."

Jenna hadn’t expected this again. She rubbed her eyes, her voice steady. "Boss, my brother’s surgery is coming up. I only came here to save up for his medical bills."

"I have enough now. I need to leave."

She paused. "I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, but my mind’s made up."

Tristan took a sharp drag, his brow furrowing. "What will you do after leaving?"

"Maybe open a small diner." Jenna pressed her lips together. "If I don’t have enough capital, I’ll start with a food stall."

"A food stall?" Tristan straightened abruptly. "You’d rather do that than come back?"

Jenna gave a bitter smile. "Not everyone can accept what I do here."

Another cigarette butt joined the ashtray. Tristan stepped closer, his voice low. "One last offer. You can transfer departments—no more alcohol sales."

"I’m sorry." Jenna bowed deeply. "I really can’t stay."

His Adam’s apple bobbed before he finally spoke. "Don’t tell Ethan I approached you."

"Understood."

As Jenna walked away, Tristan slammed his fist onto the desk. Papers scattered as his expression darkened.

The next morning.

Jenna stood at Victor Roland’s doorstep with a grocery basket. Finding the house empty, she dialed a number.

Thirty minutes later, a locksmith named Mason Mackillop arrived in a black T-shirt.

"Can you open this?" Jenna handed him a wooden box.

After inspecting it, Mason shook his head. "Only by force."

"Forget it, then." Jenna frowned. Forcing it would make too much noise—Victor would notice.

After seeing Mason out, she returned the box to its place. Scanning the room, she began searching for other clues.
###Chapter 219

Jenna Roland searched every corner of the bedroom, even crawling under the bed, but only found that suspicious wooden box.

She rubbed her throbbing temples and picked up Victor Roland's dirty clothes from the floor, heading to the bathroom.

The moment the clothes hit the ground, a metallic clink rang out.

Jenna's heart skipped a beat. She frantically pushed aside the fabric. A set of keys lay glinting coldly under the light.

Her breath caught. Her fingers trembled slightly.

This was fate.

She snatched the keys and rushed back to the bedroom. On the fifth try, the lock clicked open.

Inside the box were neatly stacked receipts and bankbooks.

Kneeling on the floor, she flipped through them with ice-cold fingertips. When she unfolded the last document, her blood turned to ice.

Her parents' suicide note.

She stuffed the note into her pocket and noticed a bankbook bearing her father's name.

A fixed deposit of $250,000, inaccessible until August.

Jenna clenched her jaw until it ached, her nails digging into her palms.

So this was why. That bastard Victor wouldn't even spare the dead.

Forcing herself to stay calm, she restored everything. The keys went back on the belt loop. The clothes returned to their pile.

Her heartbeat pounded in her ears.

The front door suddenly creaked open. Jenna slipped into the kitchen, pressing her back against the cold tiles.

Jason Roland's footsteps grew louder.

"Dad, I found the keys," his voice carried through the door. "They were on the pants you wore yesterday."

A spatula slipped from Jenna's grip and clattered loudly against the floor.
###Chapter 220

Jason ignored Jenna's icy glare and walked straight to the couch, sitting down. He pulled out his phone and quickly dialed a number saved under "10086."

The aroma of food wafted from the kitchen. As Jenna plated the last dish, the wall clock struck half past eleven.

The front door swung open. Victor and Fiona walked in one after the other. Jenna silently set the table before calling everyone to eat.

"Aren't you eating?" Fiona glanced at the empty seat.

Jenna shook her head. "I ate before coming."

Victor set down his farming tools. "Come with me to weed the orchard this afternoon."

"Fine." Jenna agreed without hesitation.

Victor frowned at the all-vegetable spread. "Not even a piece of meat?"

Jenna stood beside him. "Meat prices went up. I didn't have enough money."

Jason slammed his chopsticks down. "What about the money you earn at the club? Can't even spare a few bucks for meat?"

"Why should my money feed you?" Jenna smirked coldly.

Heidi rolled her eyes. "So stingy. How much could meat possibly cost?"

"The orchard makes hundreds of thousands a year. If you won't even buy meat for yourselves, why covet my paycheck?" Jenna crossed her arms. "I'm not your cash cow."

Fiona tried to mediate. "She's right. It's not her responsibility."

Victor shoveled rice into his mouth without a word. Jenna's gaze lingered on Heidi before curling into a smirk. "Sis-in-law, you might want to keep an eye out. Wouldn't want your husband to run off with someone else without you knowing."

She hadn't found all the evidence yet, but with her father's will and bankbook secured, Jenna had no qualms about exposing everything.

Jason's face paled. "What nonsense are you spouting?"

"Take it literally. Or do you need it spelled out?" Jenna arched a brow.

Heidi whirled toward her husband. "What have you been doing behind my back?"

Victor slammed his bowl down. Every time Jenna visited, chaos followed.

"She's lying!" Beads of sweat formed on Jason's forehead.

Jenna shrugged. "Just saw a strange number in his phone—something like 10086. Why don't you call it yourself, sis-in-law?"

Jason's pupils constricted. How did she know about that number?

Heidi snatched his phone and dialed the number from his contacts. When Jason tried to stop her, she slapped him across the face.

"Shut up!" she snapped.

The line connected. A sugary female voice cooed, "Jason, missing me already? It's only been an hour since you left..."

Heidi froze as if struck by lightning. The phone clattered to the floor.

Jason dropped to his knees, clutching her legs and begging for forgiveness.
###Chapter 221

In Jenna Roland's eyes, Jason Roland was nothing but a spineless coward.

He acted all high and mighty in front of her, yet cowered like a beaten dog the moment Heidi Roland showed up.

Watching the scene unfold, Jenna curled her lips into a cold smirk.

"Auntie, I'll take my leave now."

She turned to go.

After two steps, she suddenly glanced back at Victor Roland and the others with a sweet smile.

"Almost forgot to mention—the water I used to wash your vegetables came straight from the toilet."

"And I added some... special seasoning to your dishes."

"Hope this little surprise doesn't ruin your appetite."

"Enjoy your meal. Bye~"

The Roland family froze in shock.

By the time they processed her words, Jenna had already slammed the door behind her.

Heidi didn't even bother scolding Jason—she bolted to the bathroom and vomited violently.

Victor flew into a rage, overturning the entire dining table.

Fiona Roland trembled with fury, pointing at the door and screaming.

"Victor! This is all your fault!"

"Why did you ever let that bitch come back?!"

The thought of eating those "enhanced" meals for the past two days made her stomach churn.

Victor's face darkened. "How was I supposed to know she'd pull this?!"

"If I ever see her again, I'll kill her myself!"

Heidi emerged from the bathroom, glowering at Jason.

"Get inside! Now!"

Jason had planned to slip away.

He wanted to wait until Heidi cooled down before explaining.

But before he could move, she caught him.

Cursing Jenna a thousand times in his head, he reluctantly entered the bedroom.

The door slammed shut behind them with a deafening bang.

Two sharp slaps landed across his face.

Bright red handprints bloomed on his cheeks.

He hunched his shoulders, not daring to make a sound.

Heidi jabbed a finger at his nose. "Feeling brave, aren't you?"

"Daring to keep a mistress behind my back?"

"You're not leaving this room alive unless you explain everything!"

Her entire body shook with rage.

All these years, she thought he was different from other men.

Turns out it was all an act!

If Jenna hadn't exposed him, she'd still be in the dark.

Jason dropped to his knees with a thud.

"Sweetheart, let me explain—"

"I did it all for our family!"

"You're the only one in my heart!"

Heidi let out a bitter laugh.
###Chapter 222

Heidi kicked over the coffee table, sending glass shards scattering across the floor. Her trembling finger pointed at Jason's face. "Jason Roland, you dare say cheating on me was for my own good?"

Jason knelt on the floor, sweat beading on his forehead. "Honey, let me explain—"

"Explain my ass!" Heidi grabbed a vase and smashed it at his feet. "Four years! I've drunk enough herbal medicine to drown you!"

Jason grabbed her wrist. "Three failed IVF attempts! What was I supposed to do? Grandpa keeps demanding an heir!"

She wrenched free, chest heaving. The memories flooded back—quack remedies that made her vomit, the agony of egg retrieval that left her unconscious.

"So you went whoring in bars?" Her voice cracked.

Jason groveled. "Just a $5,000 transaction! That woman isn't fit to lick your boots!"

Heidi yanked his collar. "You only met her during ovulation? How convenient!"

His face paled. "I'm sorry—"

"Buy me a Hermès tomorrow." She shoved him away. "Lie to me again—" The fruit knife plunged into the sofa.

Jason gulped. "Done! Anything you want!"

She studied his shifty eyes and smirked. "Where does she live?"

"Eastside Apartments..." He stammered. "Honey, what are you—"

Heidi grabbed her jacket. "To meet the mother of my future 'son.'"
###Chapter 223

Heidi's nails dug deep into her palms.

Jason's words were like a blunt knife, sawing through her heart over and over. The images haunted her—his entangled silhouette with that woman.

She lowered her gaze to her flat stomach.

Why could others conceive so easily, while she remained barren? Had she committed some unforgivable sin in a past life?

Tears slid down her cheeks silently.

She wasn't weeping over her husband's betrayal. She was mourning her own inadequacy.

She understood the looks Fiona and Victor exchanged. If she failed to conceive soon, they'd force her to divorce Jason.

But she couldn't bear to let go.

Taking a shuddering breath, Heidi wiped her tears. "What will you tell your parents about the baby?"

Jason answered without hesitation. "We'll say you're pregnant, and I'm sending you to your parents' place for prenatal care. After the other woman delivers, we'll bring you back."

Her heart plummeted.

He'd already prepared the lie.

"Must you... sleep with her?"

"What choice do we have?"

She bit her lip. Apart from artificial insemination, there truly was no other way.

"Don't tell me about your... encounters." Her voice trembled. "I can't bear it."

Jason nodded.

......

Jenna hung up the phone and sped to Blue Bottle Coffee on her e-bike.

Sean was already waiting by the window.

"Big brother." She slid into the seat across from him. "Have you been waiting long?"

"Just got here."

After the server delivered their coffees, Sean cut to the chase. "What's this about?"

Jenna pulled the suicide note from her bag and pushed it toward him. "Is this your father's handwriting?"

Sean studied it carefully before shaking his head. "No."

His father had minimal education. Such elegant cursive was beyond him.

"Then who wrote it?" Jenna's gaze sharpened.

"No relative could write like this." Sean's eyes turned flinty. "An outsider must have penned it."

Jenna frowned. "Could your father have hired someone?"
###Chapter 224

Sean Roland tapped his slender fingers against the table. "That's certainly possible."

Jenna Roland leaned back on the couch, her eyes dim. "Even if we're sure he forged it, he'll deny everything in court. We have no solid proof."

"Jenna," Sean said gently, "Managing an orchard is too much for you. Why not find an easier job? It would give you more time to care for Milo."

She gave a bitter smile. "I can't even get the orchard back now. There's nothing left to manage."

A waiter approached, placing a latte in front of Jenna. "Your coffee, ma'am."

"Thank you." She took a sip, then turned to Sean with a thoughtful gaze. "Why would Uncle Victor hide the will for so long?"

She remembered him claiming years ago that it had been destroyed. Its sudden reappearance was suspicious.

Sean shook his head. "Father's motives are hard to guess. But if he kept it all these years, it must be important. Keep it safe."

"Mm." She carefully folded the document and tucked it into her bag.

Glancing at her watch, Jenna stood. "I need to visit Stella. Her ex-boyfriend beat her up—she's in the hospital."

Sean's brow furrowed. "What happened?"

After hearing the details, his expression darkened. "That scum. At least she got away in time."

Jenna grabbed her purse. "I’ll head out now. We’ll talk later."

"Be careful." He watched her leave before finishing his coffee at a leisurely pace.

In the hospital room, Sylvia Savigny sat by the bed, peeling an apple. The conversation stopped when Jenna entered.

"Feeling any better?" Jenna set a fruit basket on the nightstand, then froze at the sight of Stella.

A bandage covered Stella's forehead. Her left cheek was bruised, her right lip crusted with dried blood. Puffy eyes barely stayed open. Worst of all, her left leg hung in a cast, suspended by a metal frame.

"It's just minor injuries," Stella rasped, forcing a weak smile.

Sylvia slammed the fruit knife down. "A fractured leg and internal bleeding—'minor'?"

Dressed in an elegant navy velvet gown, her curls cascading over her shoulders, Sylvia's polished appearance only magnified Stella's haggard state.

Jenna sucked in a sharp breath. "That bastard! I should’ve let security break his legs that night!"

"My mistake for trusting him." Stella's voice was hoarse. "Don’t waste your energy on me."

Sylvia crossed her arms, fury burning in her striking eyes. "I already gave Jake Varley’s file to Mr. Lucien. He promised to make that trash pay."
###Chapter 225

Jenna frowned slightly, turning to Stella. "Who's this 'Brother Lu'?"

Stella glanced at Sylvia, who remained silent, then lowered her voice. "You must keep this confidential."

"I promise." Jenna raised three fingers solemnly.

Stella leaned closer, whispering, "Lucien Valois. The second son of Mayor Valois of Los Angeles. My sister is... involved with him."

Jenna's pupils contracted sharply. She'd seen the mayor on the news but never imagined Sylvia would be entangled with his son.

"How did they meet?" Jenna pressed.

She only knew Sylvia had worked at a nightclub, not the specifics.

Sylvia crossed her legs, twirling a lock of hair around her finger. "He frequented the club. Others couldn't handle him. I could." Her red lips curved. "Over time, this happened."

"You two..." Jenna trailed off.

Sylvia smirked. "Exactly what you're thinking."

Jenna inhaled sharply. So Sylvia was Lucien's mistress!

No wonder Jake Varley had bitten off more than he could chew.

Suddenly, Sylvia's smile vanished. Her gaze turned icy. "Jenna, I'm only telling you because of Stella. Not a word leaves this room."

"Why?" Jenna asked, confused.

Stella bit her lip. "Lucien... is married."

Jenna nearly dropped her glass.

Lucien Valois had a wife?!

The implications hit her instantly. If this got out, Sylvia would face public scorn. The mayor's daughter-in-law wouldn't let it slide.

A woman who could marry into the Valois family undoubtedly had formidable connections.

"Elder sister, this is too dangerous!" Jenna exclaimed. "If something goes wrong—"

Sylvia waved dismissively. "He gives me everything I want."

Jenna fell silent. Risking everything for material gain was beyond her comprehension.

Stella spoke up. "Sis, Jake transferred that money back. Help me get it."

"What?" Jenna stared at Stella in shock. "He took the money again?"

That despicable Jake Varley!

Sylvia's laugh was cold. "Don't worry. I'll make him repay every cent with interest."

"Thank you." Stella's voice was barely audible.

Sylvia's expression hardened. "Next time, open your eyes before choosing a man. Avoid trash like Jake."

Stella's face paled. Her nails dug into her palms. "I understand."
###Chapter 226

Sylvia Savigny had known Jake Varley was trouble from the moment she first laid eyes on him.

She'd pleaded with Stella Laurent countless times, even threatening to cut ties.

But Stella seemed bewitched, refusing to break up with him no matter what.

Now she finally saw Jake's true colors.

What a costly lesson.

Sylvia turned to Jenna Roland. "I heard you work at Studio 54?"

Jenna nodded. "Yes, but I'm quitting soon. My brother needs surgery, and my family objects."

Sylvia studied her. "That place doesn't suit you. With your qualities, you could find something better."

A faint smile touched Jenna's lips. "Thank you. I think so too."

Her phone rang abruptly.

The caller ID showed "Sophie Roscente"—Ethan Roscente's younger sister.

This was Sophie's first contact since their last meeting.

"Jenna!" Sophie's excited voice chirped through the receiver. "My friend heard you're an amazing cook and wants to try your food!"

Jenna chuckled. "When?"

"Tonight, maybe?" Sophie sounded hopeful.

Jenna hesitated.

She'd promised Tristan Ashcroft she'd work the evening shift at the club.

"If you're busy, it's okay..." Sophie's voice deflated.

"It's fine. Tonight works." Jenna relented. "But I have to leave by eight."

"Perfect!" Sophie cheered. "I'll bring her over right away!"

After hanging up, Jenna gave Stella an apologetic look. "Friends are coming over. I should go."

Stella waved her off. "Go ahead. We'll catch up later."

"Bye, Sylvia." Jenna bid farewell to the older woman.

Sylvia smiled. "Take care."

......

Groceries in hand, Jenna returned home and dialed Ethan's number.

"Speak." His cold voice cut through the line.

Jenna kept her tone soft. "Sophie's bringing a friend over for dinner. Will you...join us?"

"Hn."

The call ended abruptly.

Jenna drew a deep breath and headed to the kitchen.

By 5:30 PM, the dining table was set with an elaborate spread.

As she reached for her phone to text Sophie, the doorbell rang.
###Chapter 227

Jenna opened the door to find Sophie standing there in a pale yellow sundress.

Behind her was a girl dripping in jewelry—a pink peter pan collar blouse paired with a beige pencil skirt, her diamond bracelet glittering under the light.

Jenna stepped aside to let them in before heading to the kitchen to pour two glasses of lemon water.

"Jenna, this is my best friend Vanessa Galatea." Sophie tugged Vanessa forward. "Vanessa, meet my sister-in-law I always talk about."

Jenna set the glasses on the coffee table and nodded. "Nice to meet you, Vanessa."

"Hope I'm not intruding." Vanessa's red lips curved slightly, a trace of disdain flickering in her eyes.

Her gaze swept over Jenna's cheap loungewear and the faint scent of cooking oil clinging to her hair. Disgusting.

Sophie glanced around. "Is Ethan not back yet?"

"He'll be here soon." Jenna checked the wall clock.

Sophie immediately dialed her phone. "Ethan, we're already here... Got it."

Hanging up, she winked at Jenna. "He just pulled into the garage."

"Make yourselves comfortable. I'll get dinner ready." Jenna turned toward the kitchen.

Soon, four dishes and a soup were arranged on the dining table. As she finished setting the utensils, the doorbell rang.

"I'll get it!" Sophie bounded to the door.

Ethan stood outside holding—of all things—a bouquet of sunflowers.

Sophie gaped. "You bought flowers? For Jenna?"

"Who said roses are the only option?" He brushed past her coldly.

The rich aroma of home-cooked food hit him the moment he stepped inside. His Adam's apple bobbed involuntarily.

Jenna approached, hand outstretched. "Let me take those."

Ethan handed her the flowers and headed straight for the washroom.

When he returned, the sunflowers stood in a glass vase at the center of the table.

"They suit the dining room," Jenna remarked with a smile.

Ethan's brow furrowed. Why was she calling him "Mr. Roscente" again?

At the table, Vanessa rose gracefully. "Long time no see."

Ethan barely glanced at her, offering only a curt "Hmm."

His attention fixed on the spread—simple home-style dishes that made his mouth water.

"Is your brother not joining us?" he asked abruptly.
###Chapter 228

Jenna Roland gave a slight nod. "Yes, his classmate's family invited him to stay for dinner."

"Let's eat." Ethan Roscente averted his gaze and picked up a portion of sautéed garlic stems with pork.

Vanessa Galatea stared at the spread of dishes.

Just ordinary home-cooked meals—nothing as extraordinary as Sophie Roscente had boasted.

Her peripheral vision caught Ethan.

The man ate with focused precision, every movement exuding effortless elegance.

Vanessa smirked and stabbed her chopsticks into the steamed fish.

The first bite brought an unmistakable sneer to her brows.

But as the tender flesh slid down her throat, her expression shifted imperceptibly.

Sophie noticed the change. "Vanessa, my sister-in-law's cooking isn't bad, right?"

"Edible at best." Vanessa turned her face away, though the tips of her ears betrayed a faint flush.

"Don't touch it if you don't like it." Ethan's voice cut through like shards of ice.

The air froze instantly.

Jenna quickly stood. "Would anyone like juice? There's freshly squeezed in the fridge."

"Doesn't she have hands?" Ethan's glacial stare swept over Vanessa.

Jenna still retrieved a glass tumbler, where orange liquid caught the light in dancing flecks of gold.

"Here you go, Miss Galatea."

Ethan's brow furrowed, but he remained silent.

Sophie's eyes gleamed as she snatched the juice bottle. "I'll pour my own, sis!"

Her gaze darted to Ethan's tense jawline, and fireworks exploded in her chest.

Her brother was being possessive!

Only the clinking of cutlery filled the dining room.

Vanessa's knuckles whitened around her chopsticks.

Sophie gulped down half her juice. "So where are you working now, sis?"
###Chapter 229

Jenna Roland did have a job, but it was one she couldn't bring herself to mention.

She stole a glance at Ethan Roscente. Seeing his calm expression, she exhaled in relief.

"I'm currently unemployed," she murmured to Sophie Roscente, forcing a faint smile.

Vanessa Galatea sneered inwardly. How dare this escort girl pretend to be virtuous? If not for Ethan's presence, she would've exposed the hypocrite already.

"Not working is fine. Focusing on family is more important," Sophie said kindly.

Jenna lowered her head, fingers twisting the hem of her shirt unconsciously.

After dinner, Sophie offered to help clean up. Jenna quickly declined. When Ethan rolled up his sleeves to assist, her heart skipped a beat. She pulled Vanessa into the living room.

Vanessa's eyes widened. The CEO of HM Group doing dishes? The sight shattered her worldview.

"Vanessa, any plans later?" Sophie asked.

A calculated glint flashed in Vanessa's eyes. "I heard about a new high-end club. Want to check it out? My treat."

She smirked internally. Let's see Jenna keep up her act there.

"Sure, I'll return the favor next time," Sophie agreed cheerfully.

They bid Ethan goodbye and left.

In the kitchen, Jenna stole hesitant glances at Ethan. The sound of running water filled the silence. Gathering courage, she spoke, "Ethan... are you free today?"

It was the first time she'd called him by name.

His hands stilled almost imperceptibly. He lowered his gaze to hide the flicker in his eyes, voice cool as ever. "Nothing urgent."

"I have work tonight," Jenna's voice grew smaller. "Off at eleven. Should I... bring you supper?"

"Hmm." His monosyllabic reply didn't stop his eyes from following her movements.

After cleaning, Jenna went to fetch her bag. When she emerged, Ethan was on a phone call. Seeing her, he immediately lowered his voice.
###Chapter 230

Jenna Roland adjusted her bag and waved at Ethan Roscente. "I'm heading to work."

Ethan leaned against the doorframe, his dark gaze lingering on her in silence.

The streets were already bustling at 7:30 AM. Jenna mounted her e-bike, the wind whipping past her ears. The neon lights of Studio 54 glimmered in the distance. She checked the time and twisted the throttle to full speed.

"Jenna!" Chloe Blanchet grabbed her arm the moment she stepped inside. "Tony's been waiting for you for half an hour. He refused anyone else."

Jenna paused mid-step. "Didn't he just come last week?"

"Who knows?" Chloe lowered her voice. "He brought a gorgeous woman this time. She kept calling him 'hubby.'"

The dressing room lights were harsh. Jenna quickly changed into her work uniform, swiping on a bold shade of lipstick. The girl-next-door in the mirror transformed into a nightclub rose in an instant.

Manager Patrick Klein knocked urgently. "Tony's in VIP Room 888."

Pushing open the door, Jenna squinted through the haze of cigarette smoke. Five people lounged inside. She immediately recognized Tony Lombardi and Wendy Lombardi curled against him, while two unfamiliar girls poured drinks with practiced smiles.

"Sis, Tony." Jenna settled beside Wendy, her fingers brushing the slight swell of Wendy's abdomen. "Sorry I'm late. Had guests at home."

Wendy frowned. "You're usually here by six."

"Shift change." Jenna peeled an orange for her with a smile. "I'm quitting in two weeks."

The orange segments trembled in Wendy's palm. "Why?"

"My brother's surgery." Jenna smoothed her skirt as she stood. "Same drinks as usual?"

Tony flicked ash from his cigarette. "Get your sis a coconut water."

The hallway carpet muffled her footsteps. Only after the door closed did Wendy speak. "Lao Wu, arrange something for her after she quits." She cradled her belly. "She can't come back to this place."

Tony exhaled a smoke ring. "Her choice."

From the shadows, Felix Rubinstein cracked his knuckles. "Don't worry, sis." His voice was steel. "I'll break the arms of anyone who touches her."

Wendy laughed, playfully punching his arm. Her crystal nails gleamed cold under the lights.
###Chapter 231

Jenna Roland carried a tray into the private room, holding a bottle of red wine and orange juice.

She expertly uncorked the wine and poured a glass each for Tony Lombardi and Wendy Lombardi.

"Wendy, this juice is complimentary from the house." Jenna filled a glass and handed it to Wendy.

Their fingers brushed lightly as Wendy took the glass.

"Since when did this place become so generous?" Tony swirled his wineglass with a smirk. "Last time I was here, they even charged for napkins."

Wendy burst into laughter. "Mr. Ashcroft is that stingy?"

"Absolutely." Tony shook his head. "Even ice cubes cost extra."

Jenna sat beside Wendy, her eyes crinkling with amusement. "The owner didn't know you back then, Tony. Now you're regulars, and I work here. Of course they'd show some appreciation."

Wendy gazed at Jenna's smiling face, her expression softening.

"Jenna, any plans after quitting this job?" Wendy asked gently.

Jenna nibbled her lower lip. "Everyone suggests opening a restaurant, but I'm still deciding between a proper diner or selling accessories at night markets."

Since Milo's surgery, her burdens had lightened.

Now she'd be content just earning enough for daily expenses.

Wendy's eyes sparkled. "A restaurant would be perfect! Tony and I could invest if you're interested."

She counted on her fingers. "Just give us 20% if you make a million."

Jenna's cooking had left an indelible impression.

A restaurant meant she could enjoy those flavors regularly.

"That...would be taking advantage of you." Jenna's eyes widened.

Wendy chuckled. "With your skills, it's a guaranteed success. Open more branches, and we'll all prosper."

Jenna laughed. "You're right. But I need more time to think."

"Of course." Wendy squeezed Jenna's hand. "Jenna, the more I know you, the more I adore you—like my own sister. If you prefer, Tony could arrange a position at his company?"

Jenna returned the gesture. "Wendy, I feel the same connection. But I want to try standing on my own feet. Who knows? Maybe I'll be a boss someday too."

Admiration flashed in Wendy's eyes. "We'll support you all the way."

Jenna raised her glass. "Tony, Wendy, thank you. This one's for you!"

"Cheers!" Tony drained his glass in one go.
###Chapter 232

Jenna Roland had just set down her wine glass when her phone screen lit up.

A crisp notification tone sounded.

A message from Chloe Blanchet popped up: "Four guests just arrived in VIP Room 306. We're short-staffed. Can you help if you're free?"

Jenna quickly replied: "On my way."

She turned to Wendy Lombardi. "Sis, some guests just arrived. I need to go assist."

Wendy nodded gently. "Go ahead. Work comes first."

After nodding to Tony Lombardi and Felix Rubinstein, Jenna hurried out of the private room.

Standing outside Room 306, she habitually knocked three times.

The moment she pushed open the door, Jenna's pupils constricted sharply.

Sophie Roscente and Vanessa Galatea sat at the center of the room.

Jenna's fingers froze instantly, her body instinctively recoiling.

"Sis?" Sophie's shocked voice exploded through the room.

All eyes snapped toward the doorway.

Vanessa's lips curled almost imperceptibly. "Isn't this Sophie's sister-in-law?"

Tracy Atlante's eyes widened. "Oh my God, she really is your sister-in-law?"

Wendy Ordelia silently lowered her head.

Jenna's ears burned crimson, her palm slick against the door handle.

She never imagined encountering Sophie in this situation.

Sophie's expression darkened instantly as she stormed toward Jenna.

"You said you weren't working!" Sophie's voice trembled. "Why did you lie to me?"

Vanessa and Tracy flanked Sophie on either side.

Jenna took a deep breath and quietly closed the door.

"I'm sorry." Jenna met Sophie's gaze directly. "I was afraid you'd look down on me if you knew."

Tears welled in Sophie's eyes. "I wouldn't care if you were sweeping streets. But this place..."
###Chapter 233

Ethan Roscente was the second son of the prestigious Roscente family in Los Angeles, wielding immense power and controlling sixty percent of the nation's economic lifelines.

As the CEO of HM Group and president of the International Chamber of Commerce, the idea of his wife working at a nightclub was utterly absurd.

If this scandal got out, Ethan would become the laughingstock of the entire business world. The Roscente family's century-old reputation would be ruined overnight.

Sophie Roscente was right—even if Jenna Roland picked up trash or shined shoes, people would at most call her lowborn. But working as an escort at a nightclub? That was rubbing the Roscente name in the dirt.

"Sophie, I know you're embarrassed," Jenna said calmly. "But I've done nothing wrong. I only sell drinks for a living. Everyone at the club can vouch for me. Ask your brother if you don't believe me."

Vanessa Galatea sneered. "Do you even understand Ethan's status? Do you think he'd allow his wife to work in a place like this?"

"I know his status better than anyone," Jenna met Vanessa's gaze. "But my conscience is clear."

Tracy Atlante frowned. "How can the Roscentes maintain their standing in the business world if word gets out that Mrs. Roscente works here?"

"I earn my keep with honest work. I'm not ashamed." Jenna's voice was firm.

Sophie's temples throbbed with anger. She never imagined the sister-in-law their whole family doted on would stoop to this.

If Grandma Blanche and their parents found out, they'd be furious enough to fall ill. Divorce would be inevitable.

Knock, knock, knock—

The tense atmosphere shattered as someone rapped on the door.

It opened, and Patrick Klein peered inside.

"Patrick?" Jenna frowned.

He glanced at the group before addressing her. "Mr. Valentine is here. He requested you specifically."

"Alone?"

"Mr. Roscente is with him."

Jenna's eyes darkened. Two hours ago, Ethan had claimed he had no plans for the evening. Now he was at the club.

"Which room?"

"888."

Jenna turned to Sophie. "Your brother's here. Ask him yourself."

"Take me to him," Sophie said coldly.

They arrived at the door of VIP Room 888. Jenna pushed it open without hesitation.

Ethan and Gavin Valentine both looked up. The moment Gavin saw Sophie, he shot to his feet.

"Sophie? What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 234

Sophie Roscente's pupils constricted the moment she spotted Gavin Valentine.

She strode past him without acknowledgment, her stilettos clicking sharply as she marched toward Ethan Roscente.

"Brother!" Her voice trembled. "Have you lost your mind? Letting your wife work in a place like this? If Grandma Blanche finds out—"

Ethan set down his wineglass with deliberate calm.

The temperature in the private room seemed to plummet when his glacial gaze lifted.

"What kind of place?" he countered.

Sophie's chest heaved with indignation.

She jabbed a finger toward Jenna Roland, her tone shrill. "She's basically an escort girl! How can you even ask that?"

Ethan's eyes turned razor-sharp.

"She sells beverages," he enunciated, each word dripping with warning. "Don't project your filthy assumptions onto others."

The words detonated like a bomb in the tense silence.

Jenna's fingers unconsciously twisted the hem of her blouse.

She hadn't expected Ethan to defend her so fiercely.

Sophie's face darkened. "Beverages? Spare me the euphemisms! What's the difference between her and those escorts? If our family's reputation—"

"Enough!"

Ethan slammed his palm on the table, making everyone jump.

The room froze.

Sophie stumbled back half a step, lips quivering.

"Brother..." Her voice wavered. "I'm thinking of the Roscente family. If she quits now, I'll pretend this never happened."

His piercing stare swept over Vanessa Galatea and Tracy Atlante, making them shrink back.

Looming over his sister, Ethan radiated terrifying dominance.

"I said she sells beverages," he icily repeated. "Spread one more rumor, and you'll regret it."

Tears welled in Sophie's eyes.

She couldn't believe her own brother would treat her this way.

"Fine. Just fine." Whirling around, she spat through clenched teeth, "Let's go!"

Jenna hurried after her.

"Sophie," she intercepted the furious woman, "I know this job upsets you, but I have my reasons."

Vanessa sneered nearby. "Reasons? You're a pathological liar. Who'd believe you now?"

Jenna paled instantly.

Sophie whirled to face her. "Then tell me. What's this so-called reason?"

Her fists clenched.

If Jenna could provide a legitimate explanation, she might reconsider.

But if this was another deception...

She'd never allow such a woman to remain connected to the Roscentes!
###Chapter 235

Jenna Roland took a deep breath, locking eyes with Sophie Roscente. "My brother Milo has congenital heart disease. He needs immediate surgery that costs nearly a million."

Her knuckles turned white as she clenched her fists. "Our parents died young. With no education, I left our uncle's house with nothing but Milo. A friend said working at the club paid well, so I came."

Vanessa Galatea scoffed. "Congenital heart disease? Who'd believe such a sob story?"

Tracy Atlante sneered. "Pathetic attempt to gain sympathy."

Wendy Ordelia remained silent, observing from the sidelines.

Jenna's sharp gaze swept over them. "I'm speaking to Sophie. Whether she believes me is her choice. As for you two—your opinions mean nothing."

She'd even dared to raise a knife against Victor Roland. These pampered socialites didn't intimidate her.

Vanessa's face flushed crimson. "How dare you speak to me like that?"

Jenna stood her ground. "Are you royalty? Drop the act. The only reason I'm holding back is out of respect for Sophie."

Sophie finally spoke. "So you took this job to fund your brother's surgery?"

Vanessa gasped. "Sophie! You can't possibly believe—"

Sophie silenced her with a glance. "This is between us."

Jenna nodded firmly. "He's my everything. Bartending, scavenging—I'd do anything to save him."

After a pause, Sophie said, "I'll trust you on one condition. You must quit immediately."

She couldn't allow the future Mrs. Roscente to have such a stain on her reputation.

Jenna met her gaze steadily. "Already done. The Red Cross covered the medical bills."

Sophie's breath hitched. This stubborn girl would rather accept charity than ask Ethan for help?

She had no idea how far her brother would go for her.
###Chapter 236

Sophie Roscente tapped her fingers on the table, her gaze sharp.

"When are you planning to resign?"

Jenna Roland pressed her lips together.

"The boss wants me to stay another two weeks to hand over my work."

She paused.

"It'll give me time to arrange my brother's surgery during his summer break."

Sophie gave a slight nod.

"Two weeks. Then you're gone."

She lowered her voice.

"I won't tell Grandma Blanche about this."

Jenna exhaled in relief.

"Thank you."

"Get back to work." Sophie waved her off.

Once Jenna left, Sophie turned to her two friends.

"Not a word about what happened today."

Vanessa Galatea scoffed.

"She lied to you before. And you still trust her?"

"She's my sister-in-law." Sophie's eyes turned icy. "Watch your tone."

Wendy Ordelia smoothly intervened.

"More drinks?"

"Of course." Sophie smirked. "We're not leaving until we're wasted."

......

Inside VIP Room 888, Gavin Valentine nearly dropped his glass.

"She's really your wife?" His voice cracked.

Ethan Roscente exhaled a slow stream of smoke, neither confirming nor denying.

"Since when?" Gavin pressed. "Why keep it a secret?"

Ethan flicked ash from his cigarette.

"Grandma Blanche forced it."

"We signed the papers a month ago." His tone was detached, as if discussing someone else's life.

Gavin's eyes widened.

"Why would she insist you marry her?"

Ethan drained his glass with a bitter laugh.
###Chapter 237

"Grandma Blanche has taken a liking to Jenna." Ethan swirled his whiskey glass, ice cubes clinking. "And since I'm not getting any younger, she's using HM Group's shares and executive authority as leverage."

Gavin nearly choked on his drink.

He never expected Ethan's marriage to Jenna was orchestrated by the old matriarch.

No wonder Ethan married so abruptly. His past relationship with Yvonne Sherwood still lingered in people's memories.

"Do you even like Jenna?" Gavin couldn't help asking.

Ethan's lips curled into a sardonic smile. "What do you think?"

Gavin understood.

How could anyone love a woman they were forced to marry?

"You're really staying married forever?"

"Divorce in a year." Ethan downed his drink in one gulp.

"Divorce?" Gavin's eyes widened. "Have you considered Jenna? A divorced woman's reputation—"

"Feeling sorry for her?" Ethan cut him off coldly.

Gavin shook his head. "I just think she doesn't deserve this."

He didn't understand. If Ethan disliked Jenna, why assign bodyguards to protect her?

That wasn't how one treated a mere pawn.

Ethan's gaze darkened, offering no reply.

"Since Grandma Blanche adores her, why don't you—"

"You're unusually chatty tonight." Ethan's sharp glare silenced him.

Gavin raised his glass awkwardly.

Ethan lit a cigarette. Jenna's face materialized in the swirling smoke.

Annoyed, he stubbed it out and poured another drink.

——

At Studio 54, Jenna had just changed clothes to leave when three drunk men blocked her path.

"Hey sweetheart, have a drink with us?" The leader leered at her. "Money's no object."

Jenna remained expressionless. "I'm off duty."

"Playing hard to get?" The man sneered. "Isn't it your job to drink with customers?"
###Chapter 238

"Shift's over." Jenna Roland dropped her professional smile, her eyes turning icy.

She tried to sidestep the three drunken men blocking her path, but they closed ranks.

"Think you're too good for us?" The leader's breath reeked of alcohol as he sneered.

One of them grabbed at her arm. "Who does an escort think she is?"

Jenna clenched and unclenched her fists. Scanning the room, she suddenly flashed a bright smile. "Fine. Give me your table number. I'll change and join you."

The men swaggered off, smugly calling out their booth location.

The moment they disappeared, Jenna snatched her purse and bolted for the staff exit.

Up on the second-floor balcony, Ethan Roscente's cigarette ash trembled faintly over the railing.

"Well, well." Gavin Valentine sidled up beside him. "Someone can't take his eyes off her."

Ethan stubbed out his cigarette and strode toward the exit.

Outside the club, Sophie Roscente clung to Jenna's arm, pouting. "Come with me, please?"

Jenna massaged her temples. "I really—"

"Let's go." Ethan's voice cut in as his black overcoat brushed past her shoulder. "My car."

Gavin's eyebrows shot up—this was the same man who'd canceled on the mayor's dinner invitation last week.

Sophie seized the moment to push Jenna toward the parking lot. "I owe you for last time. Let me make it up to you!"

Jenna found herself buckled into the Porsche's passenger seat. The understated sedan hid a luxury interior.

In the rearview mirror, Ethan's lips curved the faintest fraction.
###Chapter 239

Jenna pushed open the glass door of Fortune Street Food, greeted by the smoky aroma of grilled skewers. She chose a private booth by the window. Once the four of them settled in, she ordered every signature dish on the menu.

When the server brought buckwheat tea, Jenna's gaze lingered on Sophie. "Your friends left already?" Her fingers tapped lightly on the table.

Sophie took a sip of tea. "They went back first." She paused. "Considering your... history."

Jenna suddenly leaned forward, eyes gleaming. "You brought them to Studio 54?"

"It was Vanessa's idea." Sophie shook her head. "She said she'd discovered a new place."

The realization hit Jenna instantly. Vanessa had orchestrated this to sabotage her. Her peripheral vision caught Ethan's stern profile, and she smirked inwardly—so this was about him.

"Something wrong?" Ethan lifted his gaze, his dark eyes unreadable.

Jenna looked away. "Nothing."

Gavin studied the two with a quiet sigh. They were perfect for each other, if only their feelings aligned.

"Don't mention tonight to Grandma Blanche," Ethan said abruptly.

Sophie nodded. "Understood."

Dishes arrived one after another, soon covering the round table. Jenna arched a brow at the mountain of food.

Gavin popped open four beers. "Cheers!"

Jenna downed hers in one go, then pulled on gloves to peel shrimp. The meat was tender and springy—she devoured two in quick succession.

"Want one?" She casually held out a peeled shrimp.

Ethan opened his mouth. "Yes."

Jenna's hand froze mid-air...
###Chapter 240

Jenna Roland never expected her casual question would be taken seriously.

She lowered her head to peel shrimp shells, her fingertips stained with red oil. The plump shrimp meat would surely suit his taste.

Just as she placed the shrimp in her bowl, Sophie Roscente's bowl nudged closer.

"Sis, I want some too." Sophie blinked her large eyes, her smile sweet as honey.

Jenna paused mid-motion and transferred the shrimp to Sophie's bowl instead.

Gavin Valentine stared at the plate of crimson crawfish, swallowing hard. Normally he'd have asked Jenna to peel them for him, but with Ethan Roscente present today, he didn't dare speak up.

As Jenna raised a shrimp to her lips, Ethan's deep voice rumbled beside her: "The shrimp looks good."

Her hand froze midair. Turning, she met Ethan's intense gaze, her cheeks warming slightly.

"Peeling them yourself isn't hard." She quickly popped the shrimp into her mouth.

Ethan's brow furrowed slightly as he silently donned gloves. His elegant fingers fumbled clumsily with the shell, managing only a thumbnail-sized piece of meat.

Sophie stole glances at her brother, incredulous. When had this pampered young master ever peeled his own shrimp?

"Watch, like this..." Jenna couldn't bear it any longer, leaning closer to demonstrate. "Twist off the head first, then split the back shell."

Mimicking her movements, Ethan actually produced a whole shrimp.

Sophie discreetly raised her phone, recording this rare sight.

"I heard crawfish carry parasites," Gavin mumbled around a mouthful of snails.

Jenna glanced at the pile of empty snail shells before him. "Snails aren't any better. But proper cooking kills everything."

Sophie followed suit with gloves, peeling as she asked, "Sis, can you cook crawfish?"

"Just need seasoning and beer."

"Let's do it sometime!" Sophie's eyes lit up.

Gavin immediately raised his hand. "I'll buy ingredients if you cook, Miss Roland."
###Chapter 241

Jenna arched an eyebrow at Gavin. "Sure, as long as you don't mind losing money."

Gavin swirled his beer glass. "How expensive can crawfish be? I'll buy as much as you want."

He took a long swig of the ice-cold beer.

Jenna's eyes crinkled into crescents. "Crawfish tastes better with a crowd. Bring all your friends."

Sophie immediately raised her hand. "I'll invite Wendy and Shirley!"

She deliberately avoided mentioning Vanessa and Tracy, knowing their past conflicts with Jenna.

Jenna nodded cheerfully.

Soon, the massive platter of crawfish was demolished by Ethan and Jenna.

Plenty of dishes remained on the table.

Jenna signaled the waiter. "Could we get these to-go, please?"

Sophie and Gavin both blinked in surprise.

"Jenna, these leftovers..." Sophie trailed off uncertainly.

Jenna efficiently packed the containers. "I'll take them home for Milo's midnight snack."

Sophie was speechless.

In her household, leftovers always went straight into the trash.

Gavin couldn't help asking, "Is that still edible?"

Jenna continued packing without pause. "Just refrigerate it. It won't spoil."

Gavin shot a furtive glance at Ethan.

He never expected the mighty Ethan Roscente to tolerate such frugality.

As their car pulled away from the street food stall, Sophie waved. "I'm riding with Gavin."

Ethan gave a terse nod before opening Jenna's car door.

While fastening her seatbelt, Jenna suddenly frowned. "You've been drinking."

Ethan kept his eyes on the road, offering no reply.

Jenna muttered under her breath, "Drunk driving is illegal..."

Every syllable carried clearly in the enclosed space.

Ethan's grip tightened on the steering wheel.

Of course he knew the dangers, but calling a driver would raise suspicions since everyone had been drinking tonight.

An hour later, the lights of Beverly Hills finally came into view.

Jenna exhaled deeply, the tension leaving her shoulders.

She stepped out with the takeout bag, her fingertips still chilled from the icy beer.
###Chapter 242

Jenna Roland frowned at the six takeout containers on the table. Her slender fingers could barely hold four. The remaining two were impossible.

She turned to Ethan Roscente standing nearby, her eyes pleading. "Ethan, could you help me with these?" Her voice was soft as a feather brushing against skin.

Ethan silently picked up the last two containers and strode toward the elevator. Jenna hurried after him, her heels clicking sharply against the floor.

Back home, she stuffed the containers into their double-door fridge. The hum of the appliance echoed loudly in the silent night.

Ethan sat on the couch, his face suddenly pale. Beads of sweat dotted his forehead. His long fingers gripped the armrest tightly.

"Are you okay?" Jenna knelt before him, studying his expression.

"I'm fine." He turned away, his voice cold.

A gurgling sound came from his stomach. Jenna noticed his clenched jaw, the tense line of his profile.

"Was it the spicy crawfish at dinner?" She reached out to steady him, but he pulled back.

Ethan stood abruptly and headed for the bathroom. At the door, he paused and shot her a warning glare. "Don't follow me."

Jenna froze as the bathroom door slammed shut. Guilt twisted inside her—she remembered forcing him to try the spicy dish earlier.

The wall clock read 2:10 AM. Jenna grabbed her keys and rushed out.

Wind howled past her ears as her e-bike sped through empty streets. Her dress flapped wildly, hair streaming behind her.

The pharmacy's bright lights cut through the darkness. Breathless, she described the symptoms. When the clerk handed her two boxes of medicine, she didn't wait for change.

By the time she returned, sweat had plastered her bangs to her forehead. Hands shaking, she poured water and held out the pills.

"Take these." Her voice came in gasps.

Ethan stared at her flushed cheeks and disheveled hair. His Adam's apple bobbed. "You didn't have to do this."

"You're my husband." Jenna's eyes curved into crescents. "Now swallow them."

As he took the pills, his fingertips brushed her cold hand. He threw back his head, the water smoothing down his throat. Unconsciously, his gaze softened.

"Thanks." The words were barely audible, but they sent a tremor through Jenna's heart.
###Chapter 243

"You're welcome." Jenna Roland flashed a bright smile, unconsciously twirling a strand of hair around her finger. "Rest first. I'm going to shower."

"Alright."

Ethan Roscente's gaze lingered on her with dark intensity until the bathroom door clicked shut. His eyes fell on two medicine boxes resting silently on the coffee table. He reached out, fingertips grazing the packaging with deliberate slowness.

A faint smirk curled his lips as he set them back in place. Rising, he headed toward the bedroom.

By the time Jenna emerged from her shower, the bedroom was already dark. She tiptoed to the vanity, completing her skincare routine by moonlight before quietly arranging her floor bedding.

As she settled in, she exhaled deeply. A sideways glance confirmed Ethan hadn't stirred in bed. Satisfied, she closed her eyes.

In the darkness, Ethan's eyes slid open, his gaze tracing the curve of her curled form. Only after prolonged silence did his eyelids lower again.

...

A shrill ringtone jolted Jenna awake. The name flashing on her screen sent ice through her veins—Victor Roland.

"Jenna, not coming today?" His voice held unnatural calm.

Her fingers clenched the blanket. "What scheme are you plotting now?"

"We agreed on three thousand monthly for home-cooked meals." His tone suggested they were discussing the weather.

A cold laugh escaped her. "Had enough toilet water and spit already?"

A muffled sound crackled through the line before Victor spoke through gritted teeth: "Consider us even. No debts between us."

Jenna shot upright. This uncharacteristic concession made her skin prickle.

"Victor." Her voice could freeze hell. "What exactly are you playing at?"
###Chapter 244

"Jenna, it's your uncle." Victor Roland's voice came through the phone, deliberately hushed. "Your father was my own brother. You and Milo are his children. The way I treated you before... I was wrong as an elder."

Fiona Roland whispered urgently beside him, "Keep going!"

Victor swallowed hard. "I want to formally apologize. About the orchard... Let's discuss it in person."

Jenna's fingers tightened around her phone. "Victor, after scheming so hard to steal that orchard, you suddenly want to return it?"

"Your parents visited me in a dream last night." His tone turned eerie. "They demanded I give it back to you. Or else..."

"Or else what?" Jenna scoffed.

"Or my whole family will face divine retribution." His voice trembled. "So... when can you come to the house?"

A mocking glint flashed in Jenna's eyes. "What's this? Finally feeling afraid?"

"Yes." Victor sounded desperate. "Let's meet as soon as possible."

Jenna narrowed her gaze. Something smelled fishy—Victor's sudden change of heart reeked of deception.

"We'll meet at a café. Somewhere public."

She wasn't foolish enough to walk into their territory again. The last incident remained fresh in her memory—who knew what trap they'd set this time?

"Fine. Name the place." Victor agreed readily.

After hanging up, Victor spat in disgust. "That cunning little bitch won't come here!"

Fiona stomped her foot in frustration. "How can we administer the drug if she doesn't come home?"

"Relax." Victor leaned in with a sinister grin. "I've got a better plan..."

As Fiona listened, her eyes lit up. "Brilliant! Once it's done, that 1.5 million..."

"You can spend it however you like." Victor rubbed his hands greedily.

The buyer had initially offered only 800k but doubled the price after seeing Jenna's photo. Imagining the fortune soon to be theirs, the couple exchanged smug smiles.

"This time, we can't fail!" Fiona hissed.

———

Morning sunlight bathed Beverly Hills in gold.

After freshening up, Jenna headed out with a grocery basket. The bustling market hummed with activity as she carefully selected fresh ingredients.

Back home, she texted Ethan: "Coming back for lunch?"

Receiving confirmation, she tied on an apron and began prepping. The rice cooker's aroma filled the air. Just as she picked up a kitchen knife, her phone rang.
###Chapter 245

Jenna Roland set down the kitchen knife and wiped her hands before answering the phone.

"Grandma Blanche, is everything alright?"

The kind voice of Grandma Blanche came through the receiver. "Jenna, dear, your grandfather and I were thinking of coming over for lunch. Would that be convenient?"

Jenna glanced at the half-chopped vegetables on the cutting board. "I'm actually preparing lunch right now. Please come over—I'll just add a couple more dishes."

"That's wonderful! We'll be on our way."

After hanging up, Jenna hurried to the fridge and pulled out fresh pork ribs and a sea bass.

The kitchen soon filled with the rhythmic sounds of cooking. Jenna multitasked effortlessly—chopping, stir-frying, simmering soup. By 11:30 AM, six aromatic dishes were neatly arranged on the counter.

The doorbell rang right on cue.

Jenna opened the door to find Ethan Roscente's tall frame leading the way, with beaming Grandma Blanche and Grandpa Harrison behind him.

"Please come in." Jenna stepped aside, taking Grandma Blanche's coat to hang up.

"Something smells amazing!" Grandma Blanche inhaled deeply. "We came at the perfect time."

Jenna smiled. "The food just finished cooking. Please have a seat while I bring everything out."

Grandma Blanche gave Ethan a meaningful look. "Go help Jenna."

Silently, Ethan washed his hands and followed Jenna into the kitchen. They worked in seamless coordination, soon transferring all six dishes to the dining table.

Grandma Blanche surveyed the spread and frowned. "Jenna, why are all these our favorite dishes? Where are the ones you like?"

It was always like this—the girl constantly prioritized their preferences over her own.

"I'm not picky." Jenna ladled soup into each bowl. "I enjoy all these dishes."

Grandma Blanche shook her head fondly. "You're too considerate for your own good. It makes us feel guilty."

"You and Grandpa are elderly, and Ethan works hard. It's only natural I cook what you prefer." Jenna handed Ethan his rice bowl. "Thank you."

Their fingers brushed briefly as he accepted it. "Let's eat," he said simply.

The meal unfolded in warm companionship, though Grandma Blanche kept exchanging hesitant glances with Grandpa Harrison.

After dinner, Jenna and Ethan cleared the table together. Watching her grandson efficiently wipe surfaces and wash dishes, Grandma Blanche shared a pleased look with her husband.

"Darling," she whispered, "how should we bring it up? Jenna already has so much on her plate."

Grandpa Harrison pondered. "Let's hear her thoughts first. We can always drop it if necessary."

"I can't possibly say it," Grandma Blanche demurred. "You do it."
###Chapter 246

Grandpa Harrison pulled a cigarette case from his pocket and lit one unhurriedly.

His lips curved slightly when he noticed the brand-new glass ashtray on the coffee table. Jenna must have prepared it specifically for him.

Amidst the swirling smoke, he glanced around. The once-sterile apartment now radiated warmth.

Jenna and Ethan emerged from the kitchen.

"Would you like some tea, Grandma Blanche? I just bought fresh Longjing," Jenna asked softly.

Grandma Blanche waved her hand. "Don't trouble yourself."

"It's no trouble." Jenna turned to prepare the tea.

Ethan sat beside his grandfather, fingers flying across his phone screen.

Soon, Jenna returned with a tea tray, carefully placing it on the table.

"Be careful, it's hot," she reminded.

Grandma Blanche nudged her husband with an elbow.

The old man cleared his throat. "Jenna, we have a favor to ask."

"Go ahead." Jenna straightened attentively.

"Your grandmother's birthday is coming up. We're hosting it at the villa. None of those fancy chefs can compare to your cooking." His eyes sparkled with anticipation. "Would you handle the banquet?"

Jenna hesitated. "I've never cooked for so many people..."

"Just do it your usual way." Grandpa Harrison chuckled. "We'll prepare all ingredients and assign you assistants."

Jenna glanced at Ethan, who remained silent behind his cigarette.

"When exactly?"

"This Saturday noon," Grandma Blanche interjected. "Just two or three tables."

Jenna took a deep breath. "Well... I'll try. But if it's not good enough..."

"It'll be perfect!" Grandpa Harrison thumped his chest.

Ethan stubbed out his cigarette. "You can say no."

"I want to." Jenna smiled at him.

Ethan checked his watch. "Time for the office."

Grandma Blanche stood. "We'll leave together."

After seeing them off, Jenna lingered at the doorway. She closed the door with a soft sigh.
###Chapter 247

Ethan Roscente leaned against his car at the entrance of Beverly Hills, his brow slightly furrowed.

"Jenna knows nothing about our family background. Are you sure those relatives won't slip up?"

Grandma Blanche patted his hand with a gentle smile.

"Don't worry. Your grandfather and I have warned them."

Grandpa Harrison added, "Only close family members are coming this time. No outsiders."

Ethan nodded, some tension easing from his shoulders.

Suddenly, Grandma Blanche grew serious. "Ethan, did you buy Jenna new clothes?"

She had noticed Jenna's faded T-shirt, worn too many times.

"I did." His tone was flat. "But she rarely wears them."

Her closet was filled with designer pieces he'd carefully selected, many still with tags attached.

Grandpa Harrison frowned. "Why?"

"She says they're too expensive for daily chores."

The elderly couple exchanged glances, momentarily speechless.

Grandma Blanche pressed, "How much did you spend?"

"A hundred thousand." He paused. "For the cheapest one."

Understanding dawned on her face. "That girl is used to frugality. Buy her something under a thousand next time."

Ethan checked his watch. "Heading back now?"

"We're visiting the Remetios." She waved him off. "Go to the office."

He turned and slid into his Maybach, the luxury sedan gliding away silently.

Soon after, a Rolls-Royce pulled up smoothly.

Just as they were about to board, a clear voice rang out behind them.

"Grandma? Grandpa? You're still here?"

Jenna Roland braked her shared bicycle by the curb.

The elderly couple startled. Grandma Blanche discreetly signaled the driver, who immediately drove off.

Jenna blinked at the empty street. "Having trouble getting a cab? Let me call you an Uber."
###Chapter 248

"Alright." Grandma Blanche shot Grandpa Harrison a glance, forcing a smile before turning her attention to Jenna Roland.

Jenna asked for their destination and summoned a rideshare on her phone.

She stood waiting until she saw the elderly couple safely inside the vehicle, then rode off on her e-bike with relief.

Inside the white sedan, Grandma Blanche exhaled deeply and patted her chest. "That was close. Good thing she didn't suspect anything."

Grandpa Harrison frowned. "Who knew she'd leave the house so suddenly? We'll need to be more careful next time."

"Exactly." Grandma Blanche lowered her voice. "If our identities were exposed, there'd be no explaining it later."

Grandpa Harrison nodded in agreement.

......

At the hospital room, Jenna pushed the door open to find not just Stella and Sylvia Laurent, but also a sharply dressed man in a suit.

Stella smiled warmly. "Jenna, this is Lucien Valois. Lucien, meet my friend Jenna Roland."

Jenna offered a polite smile. "Mr. Valois."

Lucien remained silent, his dark eyes sweeping over her before settling on her face.

The corner of his mouth lifted as he extended a slender hand. "Miss Roland. I've heard much about you."

After a brief handshake, Jenna withdrew her hand and turned to Stella. "How are you feeling today?"

Stella beamed. "Much better. But shouldn't you be catching up on sleep at this hour?"

Jenna's voice softened. "I was worried about you. Any news from Jake Varley?"

Sylvia interjected with a cold laugh. "The money's been recovered. As for him..." She crossed her legs elegantly. "He's lucky to be alive."

Jenna's brows furrowed. "What's his condition now?"

A glacial glint flashed in Sylvia's eyes. "His hands are useless. So is his lower body. That's the price for touching my sister."

Jenna's heart lurched, startled by Sylvia's brutality.

Yet remembering Jake's crimes, she couldn't deny he deserved it.

"What about the police..." Jenna voiced her concern.

Lucien spoke abruptly. "My people handled it. Sylvia wasn't involved." His gaze lingered on Jenna with undisguised interest. "You and Stella have known each other long?"

Jenna met his stare. "We're old friends."

Sylvia observed coldly, instantly recognizing the spark in Lucien's eyes.

She knew this man too well—Lucien Valois, the notorious playboy who never glanced twice at ordinary women.

Unless, of course, he'd taken a liking to one.
###Chapter 249

Sylvia's eyes sparkled with amusement as she gazed at Jenna.

"Jenna, you must have a boyfriend by now?" Her red lips curved into a smile. "If not, let me remind you—choose carefully."

Stella's face flushed crimson from her hospital bed.

"Sis!" She stomped her foot in frustration. "I already admitted my mistake. Why bring it up again?"

Sylvia scoffed lightly.

"I'm just warning Jenna so she doesn't end up with scum like Jake Varley."

Lucien interjected smoothly, his gaze probing.

"A beautiful woman like Miss Roland must have no shortage of suitors?"

Jenna nodded slightly.

"I am seeing someone."

Stella bolted upright.

"What?!" Her eyes widened. "Since when? Why didn't you tell me? Who is he? Is he good to you?"

Jenna massaged her temples.

"Which question should I answer first?"

Stella grinned sheepishly.

"I just don't want you to get hurt." She leaned closer. "Tell me everything. What's he like?"

"He's decent. Owns a house and car. Treats me well."

"Oh my god!" Stella gasped. "Property and wheels in Los Angeles? Where did you find this unicorn?"

Real estate prices in LA were astronomical—even suburban units cost over two million.

Not to mention owning a vehicle.

Stella did quick mental math. These were rare qualifications indeed.

"A friend introduced us." Jenna kept her tone casual.

Sylvia's peripheral vision caught Lucien's expression darkening instantly, his face stormy.

She smirked inwardly.

Just as she suspected.

Lucien had feelings for Jenna.

Thank goodness Jenna was taken. Otherwise, she'd never escape this playboy's clutches.

Stella pouted.

"Keeping secrets from me? Unforgivable!"

"We just started dating." Jenna explained. "Announcing it prematurely would be awkward if things didn't work out."

Seeing the logic, Stella dropped the subject—briefly.

Her curiosity soon reignited.

"What's his name? What does he do?"

Jenna arched an eyebrow.

"Planning to run a background check?"

"I'm being protective!" Stella declared. "What if he's a con artist?"
###Chapter 250

Jenna Roland paused, then chuckled softly. "Don't worry, I'm an excellent judge of character. He's not the type you think he is."

"If you're so sure, then I won't say more," Stella Laurent replied flatly from her hospital bed.

Jenna stood. "Get some rest. I'll visit again soon."

"Okay." Stella turned to her sister. "Sylvia, could you walk Jenna out?"

"No need," Jenna waved her hand. "I can find my way."

Lucien Valois suddenly rose and gestured firmly toward the door. "Miss Roland, allow me."

After a brief hesitation, Jenna followed him out.

The moment the door closed, Sylvia's expression darkened.

"Remember what I told you about Lucien?" she demanded, staring at Stella.

Stella nodded. "Of course. Why?"

She remembered all too well—her sister had warned her that Lucien was a notorious playboy who kept Sylvia as his mistress.

Sylvia smirked coldly. "He's set his sights on Jenna. Warn her to stay away."

"What?" Stella's eyes widened in shock. "That's impossible!"

"He specializes in seducing beautiful women." Sylvia's gaze turned icy. "Why else would he insist on escorting her out?"

The realization hit Stella like a truck. Her stomach twisted with dread.

Not only was Lucien married, but his wife came from an influential family. If Jenna got entangled with him, the consequences would be disastrous.

"I'll call Jenna right now." Stella bit her lip anxiously. "Sis... why don't you leave him?"

Sylvia inspected her manicure indifferently. "He has money. I have looks. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement."

"But if his wife finds out—"

"We're careful." Sylvia cut her off. "If I don't cash in on my youth now, what will I have when I'm old?"

Stella swallowed her words. She knew her sister's stubbornness—once Sylvia made up her mind, no one could change it.

She could only pray this dangerous game wouldn't end in disaster.
###Chapter 251

Jenna Roland swung her leg over the e-bike and was about to twist the throttle to leave.

Lucien Valois suddenly reached out to stop her. "Miss Roland, may I have your contact information?"

Jenna slammed on the brakes and looked at him in surprise. "Mr. Valois, we barely know each other."

"Stella is my fiancée's sister. And you're her friend." Lucien remained composed. "It would be convenient to have your number."

Jenna forced a polite smile. "I'll contact Stella directly if anything comes up. Excuse me, I'm in a hurry."

She quickly twisted the throttle, and the e-bike zipped away.

In the rearview mirror, Lucien's figure grew smaller. Jenna frowned. What was his deal? Asking for her number out of nowhere.

Lucien stood still, watching the e-bike disappear around the corner. He pulled out his phone and dialed a number.

"Run a background check," he ordered curtly.

......

Jenna carried her grocery bag into Beverly Hills.

Sweat trickled down her cheeks. She stuffed the groceries into the fridge before collapsing onto the couch.

After a quick shower, she opened the fridge. Condensation beaded on the chilled soda can.

She took several gulps, the cold liquid soothing her throat. A satisfied sigh escaped her lips.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

"Hello?" Jenna towel-dried her damp hair.

"Jenna!" Stella's voice was urgent. "Stay away from Lucien Valois!"

The soda can clattered onto the coffee table. "What do you mean?"

"He's interested in you!" Stella hissed. "He just called to ask about you."

Jenna nearly choked on her soda. "Isn't he with your sister?"

"My sister?" Stella scoffed. "She's only after his money and connections. The point is—"

The line went silent for a few seconds.

"Lucien is already married," Stella enunciated each word. "His wife is the only daughter of the Zhou Group."

Jenna's fingers absently traced the condensation on the soda can.

The cold sensation sent a shiver down her spine.

"If you knew he was married..." Jenna's voice tightened. "Why would you..."

"That's why I'm warning you!" Stella's pitch rose in panic. "We can't afford to cross the Zhous!"
###Chapter 252

Sylvia's affairs ultimately belonged to the Savigny family's private matters.

Jenna Roland had no intention of meddling.

"Oh, he also asked for my number. I didn't give it to him."

"Typical playboy!" Stella Laurent's voice dripped with disgust. "Don't even acknowledge him."

"Got it." Jenna finished her cola and tossed the can into the trash. "I'm going to nap for a bit."

"Mm."

After hanging up, Jenna couldn't be bothered to return to her bedroom. She stretched out on the sofa instead.

Scrolling through her phone, drowsiness gradually overtook her.

Her eyelids grew heavy, and soon she drifted into sleep.

When she awoke again, the setting sun cast long shadows through the window.

She boiled a simple bowl of noodles, did her laundry, then got ready for work.

Her phone rang just as she arrived at Studio 54's entrance.

Grandma Blanche.

Jenna parked and answered the call.

"Grandma."

"Are you busy?"

"Just got to the club. What do you need?"

"I'm sending you a menu. Let me know which dishes you can prepare. I'll adjust the rest."

"Alright, go ahead and send it."

The text notification chimed moments after hanging up.

Jenna reviewed the menu carefully before calling back.

"Grandma, I can make all of these."

"Really? Wonderful!" Delight warmed Grandma Blanche's voice. "I was worried we'd have to change the menu. You're amazing!"

Jenna scratched her head sheepishly.

"They're just home-style dishes."

"That's no simple skill!" Grandma Blanche enthused. "Why don't you open a restaurant? Your grandfather and I could invest."

Warmth bloomed in Jenna's chest.

"I'll think about it."

"No rush." Grandma Blanche sounded pleased. "Since you can handle everything, I'll have the villa prepare the ingredients."

"Thank you, Grandma."

"Get back to work now. Talk soon."

Tucking away her phone, Jenna entered the club after parking.

At six p.m., fresh from the staff meeting, Jenna was changing when Patrick Klein appeared.

"Come with me."

She followed him to the lounge.

The door clicked shut behind them. Patrick's expression turned grave.

"The mayor's son is here. Given his status, I'm entrusting him to you." His voice dropped. "No mistakes."
###Chapter 253

Patrick Klein's words struck Jenna Roland like a thunderbolt. Her pupils constricted sharply. Unconsciously, her fingernails dug into her palms.

"His last name is Valois?" Her voice tightened. "Lucien Valois?"

Patrick looked surprised. "You know him?"

Jenna suppressed the storm raging inside her. Her expression remained neutral. "We've met once. Not close."

She never expected Lucien Valois to appear here. Coincidence or calculated move? Stella Laurent's warning call echoed in her mind. If he was really targeting her...

A cold sweat broke out on the back of her neck. This meant he had already investigated her thoroughly—even knew her workplace.

"Can someone else go instead?" she blurted out.

Patrick frowned. "Why?"

"I don't want to." Her tone was final.

The air froze. It was the first time she'd refused an assignment.

"Mr. Valois isn't an ordinary client." Patrick lowered his voice. "Offend him, and our entire club suffers." His gaze turned pleading. "Do this for me."

Jenna clenched her fists. The image of Lucien Valois keeping Sylvia Savigny as his mistress stabbed her heart. She couldn't give him any opportunity.

"Let someone else try first." She stood firm. "Come to me only if it's absolutely necessary."

Patrick studied her for a long moment before turning away.

Jenna immediately called Stella. "Lucien Valois is here. Get your sister over now."

"He actually investigated you?" Stella's voice trembled. "I'll contact her right away."

As Jenna hung up and prepared to leave, Chloe Blanchet pushed the door open.
###Chapter 254

Jenna finally relaxed as the school collaboration was settled.

For once, she went to bed early without tossing and turning.

Moonlight spilled like water outside, dotted with stars that draped the city in silver.

"Ethan!"

A scream shattered the night's silence. Jenna bolted upright, her forehead glistening with sweat.

She looked around dazedly, fingers clutching the blanket edge.

"Just a dream..."

She turned on the bedside lamp, its warm glow dispelling the darkness.

Her hand brushed the empty space beside her, reminding her Ethan was on a classified mission.

"Why would I dream that..."

Jenna got up to pour water, her hands trembling slightly.

In the dream, Ethan leaned against their doorway in a blood-soaked uniform.

She'd rushed to grasp his hand, only to feel sticky wetness.

"Forgive me."

With those words, he'd pulled away and vanished into darkness.

Jenna stared at her palm as if the vivid crimson still stained it.

"That uniform was drenched in blood..."

Clutching her chest, she felt an invisible fist squeeze her heart.

At dawn's first light, Jenna went to her parents' house.

Hoping for comfort, she found them laughing with Aunt Daisy.

"Jenna, try this protein shake," Daisy offered warmly.

She forced a smile. "Thanks, Aunt Daisy."

Her mother noticed her pallor. "Trouble at school?"

"No..." Jenna shook her head. "I had a nightmare."

Her mother patted her hand dismissively. "Dreams mean the opposite."

"But this felt so real..."

"Silly girl, just flip your pillow over before sleeping," her mother chuckled.

Jenna sighed helplessly.

Daisy brought homemade burgers. "I brought these specially for you."

Jenna took a mechanical bite, tasting nothing.

"I need to make a call." She set down the burger and hurried to the living room.

A calm male voice answered. "Who may I say is calling?"

"I'm Ethan's wife. Has he returned from his mission?" Her voice quivered.

A pause. "One moment please."

A deeper voice came on. "Mrs. Roscente, mission details are confidential. We appreciate your understanding."

Jenna gripped the receiver. "The children miss him..."

Instantly regretting the weak excuse—their toddlers were too young to verbalize missing Daddy.

The officer ignored the flimsy pretext. "Please wait patiently. He'll return after completing his assignment."
###Chapter 255

Jenna's lips curved slightly, but skepticism flickered in her eyes. "Really?"

Gavin nodded eagerly, his tousled bangs swaying. "Absolutely. If our presence bothers you, we'll vanish immediately."

Her fingers paused on the wineglass, its facets catching fractured light. "That's not what I meant," she said, softening her tone. "I just find the coincidence... curious. But paying customers are always welcome here."

"Thought we'd been blacklisted." Gavin chuckled, tapping the crystal glass. "Another pour, Miss Roland?"

As amber liquid barely coated the base, sharp knocks erupted at the door.

All heads turned as Patrick entered, bowing apologetically. He murmured excuses to Gavin's group before pressing close to Jenna's ear. "Emergency. Now."

Her brow furrowed. Only one VIP caused this level of panic.

She returned the bottle to its ice bucket with deliberate calm. "Excuse me, Mr. Valentine."

Under the corridor's dim sconces, Patrick's left cheek bore livid finger marks. "Lucien Valois demanded you personally," he whispered. "Stella's unconscious from the slap."

Jenna's pupils contracted.

Lucien had tracked her down. Worse—his brutality extended even to assaulting managers publicly.

"The boss's orders?" Her fists clenched.

"Go immediately!" Patrick stamped his foot. "Mr. Ashcroft already called Ethan Roscente. God knows why he—"

Her breath hitched.

If even Tristan Ashcroft feared retaliation, the Valois family's reach exceeded rumors. Elevator numbers blinked as her nails carved crescents into her palms.

Meanwhile in VIP 308, Gavin's phone illuminated.

Ethan's voice held glacial shards: "Guard Suite 888. If Lucien touches one hair on her—" A lighter snapped open. "—beat him to pulp."
###Chapter 256

Gavin's pupils constricted abruptly. His Adam's apple bobbed twice.

Ethan's slender fingers tapped the tabletop, his voice icy. "Gavin, answer me."

Gavin snapped back to attention, a cold sweat breaking out down his spine. "Understood!"

Though utterly confused, he didn't dare ask questions.

Setting down his wineglass, he shot Liam and Oliver a meaningful look. "Follow me upstairs."

The two exchanged glances but noticed Gavin's grave expression. Silently, they trailed behind.

......

Inside VIP Room 888, crystal chandeliers cast a hypnotic glow.

Jenna stood beside the gilded coffee table, her gaze fixed on the man lounging across the sofa.

Lucien's black dress shirt was buttoned to the top. His Patek Philippe watch gleamed coldly under the lights.

He patted the leather couch beside him. "Have a seat, Miss Roland."

A smirk played on his lips, but his eyes remained fathomless.

Jenna sat gracefully, her fingers subtly tightening around her skirt. "What would you like to drink, Mr. Valois?"

Four hulking bodyguards flanked them, their black shirts straining over intimidating musculature.

Lucien leisurely lit a cigar. "Any recommendations?"

"Romanée-Conti has a rich, velvety finish that would suit you perfectly." Jenna's voice was crisp. "Complimentary with five signature appetizers."

She flawlessly listed over a dozen premium labels, including their exact vintages.

Through the haze of smoke, Lucien suddenly leaned in close. "You choose."

Jenna's breath hitched, her nails digging into her palms. "I'll fetch the bottle then."

"Not so fast." Lucien abruptly seized her wrist, ash tumbling into the crystal ashtray. "You're trembling?"

Meeting his gaze squarely, Jenna replied, "You flatter me, Mr. Valois. The customer is always right."
###Chapter 257

Lucien Valois tapped the table with his slender fingers, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "If you're not afraid, why are you avoiding me? Why insist on having Patrick switch your assignment?"

Jenna Roland lowered her gaze, her fingers unconsciously tracing the hem of her skirt.

After a long pause, she lifted her clear eyes. "Mr. Valois, I'm Stella's friend. Given your... relationship with Sylvia, I don't want to invite gossip."

"Oh?" Lucien arched an eyebrow. "What relationship do Sylvia and I have?"

Jenna pressed her lips together. "You know exactly what I mean."

Lucien suddenly leaned forward, his warm breath brushing her ear. "It's just a mutually beneficial arrangement. Why do you care?"

The tips of Jenna's ears burned.

His words carried an intimate undertone, as if she were jealous!

"Mr. Valois, have you reviewed the wine list?" She subtly put distance between them.

Lucien chuckled. "You choose."

Jenna strode toward the door. The moment her fingers touched the handle, her heart skipped a beat.

Outside, Gavin Valentine and two others were eavesdropping with their ears pressed to the door.

"Mr. Valentine?" Jenna frowned.

Gavin gave an awkward laugh. "Just passing by."

Jenna didn't press further and headed downstairs.

Tristan Ashcroft intercepted her. "Did he give you trouble?"

"No." She shook her head. "It's just... strange."

Tristan's expression darkened. "Patrick said he hit Lily Evans and demanded to see you."

Jenna bit her lip. "I ran into him at the hospital at noon. Stella warned me to be careful..."

"Did you mention being married?"

"I did." Jenna smiled bitterly. "It didn't matter."

Tristan slammed his fist against the wall.

Lucien was notorious for his womanizing, but he never touched married women. Why was he fixated on Jenna?

"What wine did he want?"

"He told me to pick." Jenna hesitated. "Should I choose the most expensive one?"

"Just get rid of him!" Tristan ground his teeth. "I'd pay to see him leave!"

Jenna burst into laughter.

The infamous Lucien Valois being called a jinx was oddly satisfying.

"Romanée-Conti?"

"Go!"

As Jenna turned away, she heard the sound of shattering glass behind her.
###chapter 258

Tristan Ashcroft leaned back in his office chair, his fingers swiping rapidly across his phone screen before dialing Ethan Roscente's number.

The call was answered almost instantly.

"Mr. Roscente, Ms. Roland is perfectly fine."

He swallowed hard. Compared to the bullying Lucien Valois, the self-made Ethan Roscente intimidated him far more.

"How many?" Ethan's voice was ice-cold.

"Five, including Lucien Valois."

"Fire Jenna Roland."

Tristan's grip on the phone stiffened. He had fought tooth and nail to keep her employed in the first place.

"...Understood."

The call ended with a sharp click.

Tristan tilted his head back, staring at the ceiling as he exhaled a long, heavy breath.

Just who the hell was Jenna Roland?

To have Ethan personally intervene, and yet still provoke Lucien's relentless pursuit.

He rubbed his temples. "What a troublemaker."

......

Inside VIP Room 888, Jenna poured Lucien another glass of wine.

"Enjoy your drink, Mr. Valois. I'll excuse myself now."

Lucien's slender fingers traced the rim of his glass. "Leaving so soon?"

"Other guests are waiting."

"How much do you make in a night?" he asked abruptly.

"Depends. Anywhere from a few thousand to over ten thousand."

Lucien smirked. "Twenty grand. Stay with me tonight."

Jenna's lashes fluttered. The offer was absurdly high.

"I only promote beverages, not companionship. If you'd like an escort, I can arrange one for you."

His smile faded. "Are you refusing me, Ms. Roland?"

A thin layer of sweat formed on Jenna's back. She knew the real test had begun.
###Chapter 259

"Mr. Valois, I'm just a beverage promoter." Jenna met his gaze steadily, her voice calm and measured.

Lucien narrowed his eyes, his lips curling into a dangerous smirk. "Are you rejecting me, Miss Roland?"

Several bodyguards in black suits rose simultaneously, surrounding Jenna.

The air turned icy.

Jenna clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms.

"Stand down!" Lucien barked abruptly. "Do you think you can afford to frighten Miss Roland?"

The bodyguards exchanged glances before retreating to their positions.

Jenna frowned. "Are you forcing me into something I don't want, Mr. Valois?"

Lucien took a step forward, his towering frame looming over her. "You're overreacting. I merely invited you for a drink."

"Sorry, I don't accompany clients for drinks." She held her ground.

Surprise flickered in Lucien's eyes.

No one had ever dared to refuse him like this.

Her defiance only fueled his desire to conquer her.

"Interesting." He chuckled darkly. "There's nothing Lucien Valois can't obtain."

The private room door suddenly swung open.

Sylvia Savigny strode in, her stilettos clicking against the floor.

Lucien's expression darkened instantly. "Get out!"

Sylvia smiled brightly. "I heard you were here, Lucien. I came to toast you."

She subtly positioned herself between Jenna and Lucien.

Slap!

A brutal backhand struck Sylvia across the face.

Jenna gasped. "How dare you hit her?"

Sylvia quickly grabbed her arm. "Jenna, don't provoke him."

Lucien's gaze turned predatory. "You're not leaving tonight, Jenna Roland."

He resembled a furious beast, ready to pounce at any moment.
###Chapter 260

Lucien Valois lunged like a rabid dog, his palm striking Sylvia Savigny's face with a sharp crack that echoed through the private room.

"I'm tearing this damn place apart today!" he roared, eyes bloodshot.

Sylvia cradled her stinging cheek, forcing back tears. She released Jenna Roland from her protective grasp and forced a placating smile as she approached Lucien.

"Lucien, please calm down," she pleaded, reaching a trembling hand toward him.

A vicious glint flashed in Lucien's eyes. His foot shot out, slamming into Sylvia's abdomen. She gasped, stumbling backward into the coffee table.

"Whore!" He jabbed a finger at her face. "You should be grateful I even look at you. Who do you think you are?"

Sylvia knew him too well. This unpredictable madman always took his rage out on those around him. She'd spent years obeying his every whim without protest.

But today was different.

Jenna was Stella's guest. She couldn't stand by.

"You can't touch Jenna." Sylvia pushed herself up from the table, shielding Jenna.

Lucien sneered as he advanced. "There's no woman I can't have!" He jerked his chin at his bodyguards. "Drag her out!"

Four men immediately closed in. Though Sylvia had always treated them kindly, none dared disobey their employer now.

"Three. Two—"

The countdown froze.

The door swung open. A middle-aged man in a tailored suit and gold-rimmed glasses entered, flanked by a man and woman.

Lucien paled. "Father?"

Vincent Valois strode forward and delivered a stinging slap.

"Get home. Now." His quiet voice carried undeniable authority.

Lucien clutched his cheek, resentment burning in his eyes. "I'm not leaving!"

"One minute." Vincent checked his watch coldly. "If you're not out, you're no son of mine."

As he turned to leave, Vincent's gaze lingered on Jenna for a fleeting moment. His unreadable expression hinted at some hidden secret.
###Chapter 261

Lucien Valois's fury radiated through the private booth. His knuckles turned white as he clenched his fists, glaring at Sylvia Savigny's retreating figure.

This secret affair had been hidden even from his lawfully wedded wife, let alone his parents overseas.

Who had betrayed him?

Dark currents swirled in Lucien's eyes. He suddenly spun around and seized Jenna Roland's wrist.

"Mr. Valois!" Jenna winced in pain, struggling against his grip.

The man abruptly released her, downing his whiskey in one gulp. "I startled you."

Jenna took two steps back, warily eyeing him. "If there's nothing else, I should return to work."

"Stay." Lucien blocked her exit. "Be with me, and you'll want for nothing."

"I have a husband," Jenna stated coldly.

Lucien smirked, reaching to touch her face. "What can that pauper possibly offer you?"

She slapped his hand away. "His heart. Can you match that, Mr. Valois?"

The words ignited Lucien's rage. His eyes burned crimson as he punched the wall. "Get out!"

Jenna fled the booth without looking back.

The hallway lights stretched her shadow long and thin. Behind her, glass shattered amidst a man's enraged curses.

"Jenna!" Chloe Blanchet grabbed her arm in panic. "Mr. Valois is at reception. Hide!"

The lounge curtains fluttered slightly. Jenna curled up on the sofa until Chloe returned with news of Lucien's departure.

"Tristan wants to see you," Patrick Klein entered hesitantly.

Smoke hung thick in Tristan Ashcroft's office. Stubbing out his cigarette, the club owner said gravely, "You're fired, effective tomorrow."

Jenna gripped her skirt. "Because of Lucien Valois?"

"He just purchased thirty percent of Studio 54." Tristan gave a bitter laugh. "I can't protect you."

Outside, a Rolls-Royce glided away. In the rearview mirror, the man's brooding gaze remained fixed on a particular window atop the nightclub.
###Chapter 262

Jenna Roland frowned deeply. "Boss, are you afraid I'll bring trouble to everyone?"

Tristan Ashcroft took a deep breath. "Lucien Valois isn't someone ordinary people can provoke. If he targets you, none of us can protect you."

Jenna's heart trembled.

She hadn't expected Tristan to fire her for this reason.

Though it hurt, she understood the truth.

Lucien was indeed beyond their ability to oppose.

Her leaving would be best for everyone.

Jenna bit her lip. "I understand. I'm sorry, Boss."

Tristan lit a cigarette. "How did you even get involved with him?"

Lucien had visited the club once two years ago and never returned.

Jenna briefly explained how she'd met him.

Tristan cursed aloud after hearing her story. "That bastard! Preying on a married woman!"

Jenna cleared her throat. "Boss, about my salary..."

Tristan waved his hand. "Send me your account details. I'll transfer it tomorrow."

"Thank you, Boss." Jenna turned to leave.

Tristan rubbed his temples in frustration.

If not for Lucien causing trouble, Jenna could've worked at least two more weeks.

How much money would she have earned him in that time?

Damn that bastard!

If not for his father being Vincent Valois, he'd have made sure Lucien left on a stretcher tonight!

His phone suddenly rang.

Tristan answered. "Mr. Roscente, Lucien was taken away by his father. Jenna's unharmed."

Ethan Roscente's icy voice sent chills down Tristan's spine. "Did he touch her?"

"No. Fortunately, his father arrived in time."

Tristan was once again stunned by Ethan's connections.

To actually summon Vincent Valois himself...

"Hmm." Ethan hung up coldly.

The office door suddenly swung open.

Gavin Valentine and Liam Melford walked in.

Tristan looked up. "Finished drinking?"

Gavin stood before the desk. "Was it you who notified Vincent Valois?"

Tristan gave a bitter smile. "Do I look that capable? I don't even know where he lives."
###Chapter 263

Gavin Valentine frowned deeply, his probing gaze fixed on Tristan Ashcroft. "Who could possibly summon him?"

Tristan shrugged. "Who else but Ethan Roscente?"

Realization dawned on Gavin. Of course. Only someone of Ethan's stature could make Vincent Valois personally come to the club to retrieve his useless son.

Thankfully Vincent arrived in time. Otherwise, Gavin and his friend would've had to barge in to rescue Jenna Roland.

Gavin hopped onto the desk and motioned for a cigarette. He took a long drag before speaking. "Honestly, this place of yours is a den of snakes. Today it was Lucien Valois. What if someone even more powerful comes for Jenna next time? We can't protect her forever."

Tristan exhaled a smoke ring. "Ethan asked me to fire Jenna. I agreed. She won't be coming back starting tomorrow."

Gavin's eyes lit up. "Seriously?"

Tristan gave him a strange look. "Why are you so happy?"

"Damn right I am!" Gavin cursed. "My nightlife's been ruined playing bodyguard for Jenna every damn day. I've been more miserable than a ghost. Now that she's leaving, I'm finally free!"

"..."

While Gavin celebrated, Tristan mourned the loss of his cash cow. No one brought in profits like Jenna did.

He wanted to scream.

Gavin tapped his cigarette. "Why the long face? Can't bear to let Jenna go?"

Tristan sighed heavily. "Do you know how much money Jenna made for this club?"

Gavin shook his head.

Tristan held up nine fingers.

"Nine hundred thousand?" Gavin looked shocked.

Tristan wagged his index finger. "Nine million. And that's just from her alone, not counting other revenue streams. Tell me, how could I not be reluctant?"

"..."

Gavin never imagined Jenna was that profitable.

Nine million was no small sum!

He collected himself. "But she has to leave. Otherwise, Lucien will keep causing trouble."

Tristan sighed again. "Losing my top earner hurts."

Gavin rolled his eyes. "It's not like anyone could touch Jenna here anyway. Ethan would destroy them—and you'd be next."

"What do you mean?" Tristan frowned.

Gavin cleared his throat and crooked a finger.

Tristan leaned in.

In a hushed tone, Gavin revealed, "Jenna and Ethan are married."

"Holy shit!" Tristan jumped up, eyes wide. "You're kidding!"

Gavin scoffed. "Why would I lie? I had the same reaction when I found out. No wonder he made me protect her every night. No wonder he kept showing up here. It all makes sense now!"

"..."

Tristan's mind went blank. Even if the sky fell, he'd never have guessed Jenna's husband was Ethan Roscente—the ruthless king of Wall Street!

Wait. If Ethan was her husband, why let her work here?

Bewildered, Tristan sat back down. "Why would Ethan allow Jenna to work here? He could support her for ten lifetimes. Why let her do this job?"
###Chapter 264

Gavin Valentine stubbed out his cigarette, his gaze fixed on Tristan Ashcroft's face. "Jenna has no idea about Ethan's true identity. You'd better keep your mouth shut."

Tristan's pupils constricted sharply.

Ethan Roscente had married Jenna Roland while hiding his billionaire status?

This was utterly unbelievable!

"What's his angle?" Tristan's voice tightened. "Why would someone like him hide that kind of wealth?"

Gavin shrugged. "Wish I knew."

The revelation exploded in Tristan's mind like a detonation.

Jenna's husband was Ethan Roscente?

Mechanically, he lit another cigarette, his expression unreadable behind the smoke.

Gavin hopped off the table. "Since Jenna's not coming, I should head out."

Tristan gave a wooden nod, watching Gavin leave.

......

At eleven p.m., Jenna dragged her exhausted body back to Beverly Hills.

She pushed open the door to complete darkness.

Flipping on the lights, she went straight to the bedroom.

The bed was neatly made—and empty.

Frowning, Jenna checked her phone.

Midnight. Ethan never stayed out this late.

Her finger hovered over the call button, but she ultimately didn't press it.

What if she woke him...

After a hot shower, Jenna hesitated by the bed.

Since he wasn't here, maybe she didn't have to sleep on the floor tonight?

She slipped under the covers and fell asleep almost instantly.

At two a.m., the door creaked open.

The heavy scent of alcohol permeated the air.

Ethan stood by the bed, moonlight illuminating Jenna's sleeping face.

His brow furrowed slightly.

This was the first time he'd seen her in his bed.
###Chapter 265

Ethan Roscente stood by the bed, his dark gaze fixed on Jenna Roland's sleeping form.

His eyes traced the peaceful curve of her face before lingering on her slightly parted lips.

His Adam's apple bobbed involuntarily.

That soft pink reminded him of cherry blossoms blooming in early spring.

His gaze traveled lower, settling on the loose neckline of her silk nightgown.

The delicate fabric rose and fell with each breath, hinting at the curves beneath.

Ethan clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white.

He forced himself to look away and strode to the opposite side of the bed.

His dress shirt and slacks were discarded carelessly on the floor.

The mattress dipped slightly under his weight.

He maintained a deliberate distance—enough space for another person between them.

Turning his back to Jenna, Ethan yanked the covers over his head.

His heartbeat pounded in his ears.

Thump. Thump. Thump.

It felt like his chest might burst.

The air beneath the blanket grew thin.

The suffocating sensation oddly helped calm him.

When he finally threw off the covers, a faint fragrance drifted into his senses.

The sweet yet crisp scent of gardenia—Jenna's signature perfume.

He turned his head slightly.

Moonlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting delicate shadows on her eyelashes.

Surrounded by her scent, exhaustion finally claimed him.

......

Morning light seeped through the gap in the curtains.

Ethan opened his eyes and instinctively glanced beside him.

The sheets were neatly smoothed, long gone cold.

A self-deprecating smile tugged at his lips.

He'd expected to find her flustered this morning.

Instead, she'd remained perfectly composed.

Of course. Sharing a bed was perfectly normal for married couples.

His fingers brushed over the indentation her head had left on the pillow.

The faintest trace of her fragrance clung to his fingertips.

Before he realized what he was doing, he grabbed the pillow and inhaled deeply.

The sound of the door unlocking made him freeze.

Jenna stood in the doorway, a breakfast tray in her hands.

Their eyes locked.

Ethan's ears burned crimson.

"Get out!" he barked, hurling the pillow aside.

Jenna's hands trembled, nearly spilling the milk on the tray.

"I—I came to call you for breakfast..."

"I know."

The door clicked shut again.

Jenna leaned against the wall, her heart hammering.

That image wouldn't leave her mind.

Had Ethan just... smelled her pillow?
###Chapter 266

Jenna Roland suddenly shivered.

Had she actually married a pervert?

Milo Roland rubbed his eyes as he emerged from the bedroom, finding his sister frozen outside the master bedroom door.

"Sis, what are you doing here?"

Jenna snapped back to reality, instinctively touching her itchy forehead.

"Breakfast is ready. Go wash up first."

Milo nodded, his gaze lingering on the master bedroom door for a second before heading to the bathroom.

Sunflowers stood in a vase on the dining table, their bright yellow petals glaring under the morning light.

Jenna stared at the flowers, reminded of Ethan Roscente's bizarre behavior earlier.

Too yellow.

Her eyes widened suddenly.

They'd shared a bed last night. Had that creep done something to her?

Ethan stepped out of the bedroom in his impeccable suit, brushing past her without a word.

He waited a full two minutes outside the bathroom door.

"Good morning, Mr. Roscente," Milo greeted politely when he came out.

Ethan didn't even glance up before shutting the bathroom door behind him.

"Sis, what's wrong with Mr. Roscente today?" Milo whispered as he sat down.

Jenna bit into her toast.

Of course he's in a bad mood—getting caught red-handed as a pervert.

"No idea," she muttered.

Ethan finished his morning routine and began eating in silence.

Jenna's eyes kept darting to his face.

"Had enough?" Ethan abruptly set down his fork.

Jenna twisted her fingers together, her voice shrinking. "Last night...you didn't...you know..."

Ethan smirked coldly. "You're not my type."

The dining room emptied until only they remained.

"So you really didn't touch me?" Jenna's eyes rounded.

Ethan continued slicing his omelet with elegant precision, not bothering to respond.

Jenna poked at her oatmeal, mumbling, "I thought you weren't coming back, that's why I slept there...You could've woken me..."

"I tried." Ethan didn't look up. "You slept like a log."

"That's a lie!" Jenna slammed her palms on the table. "I'm a light sleeper!"

Ethan wiped his mouth and stood. "Believe what you want."
###Chapter 267

Jenna Roland pursed her lips at Ethan Roscente's words. She had always been a light sleeper, waking at the slightest disturbance.

For him to claim she slept like a log was absolutely impossible.

Recalling Ethan's strange behavior this morning, Jenna became even more convinced something had happened last night.

Too bad she had no proof. Otherwise, she'd give him a proper interrogation!

Breakfast passed in unusual silence. Ethan set down his chopsticks and left without a backward glance.

Jenna froze. Normally he'd at least say "I'm leaving." Today he just walked out?

She bit her chopstick, brows furrowed.

Was he... angry?

Ethan sat in his car, ears burning. He desperately tried to forget this morning's embarrassing incident.

But the harder he tried, the clearer the memory became.

He covered his face in frustration. Jenna must think he's some kind of pervert now.

This was it. How could he ever face her again?

Taking a deep breath, Ethan stared out at their Beverly Hills neighborhood and sighed heavily.

He pulled out a cigarette and lit it.

Getting caught sniffing her pillow at dawn... his image was completely ruined.

No. He had to explain.

Ethan took out his phone and searched for Jenna's WeChat. After minutes of scrolling, he still couldn't find her contact.

His frown deepened. Had his assistant deleted her?

Then he remembered—he'd never added a nickname for her. His assistant routinely purged unlabeled contacts...

Rubbing his temples, Ethan copied Jenna's number to re-add her.

The notification read: "This user is not in your contacts."

She'd deleted him.

He stared at the screen for a long moment before finally exiting the app.

Fine. They'd be divorced in a year anyway. What did it matter?

Ethan started the engine and slammed the accelerator, speeding toward his company.

After cleaning the kitchen, Jenna gave the entire house another thorough scrub.

She stripped Ethan's bedding and tossed it into the washing machine.

Exhausted, she collapsed onto the sofa and stared blankly at the ceiling.
###Chapter 268

Jenna Roland leaned against the couch, her fingers absently tapping the phone screen.

Sunlight streamed through the window, but she paid it no attention.

The numbers in her bank account were enough to support her and Milo comfortably. Yet she knew money wouldn't last forever without a steady income.

"Opening a restaurant?" She shook her head.

Just thinking about dealing with business licenses, taxes, ingredient sourcing, and staff management gave her a headache.

Her phone vibrated suddenly.

A short video caught her eye—a ponytailed girl selling colorful jewelry at a night market stall, the accessories glittering under string lights.

Jenna clicked into the account. It had over 200k followers.

"That profitable?" Her eyebrows shot up.

The wholesale market was in the east district. She'd shopped there before.

The wholesale prices were shockingly low. Reselling could triple the profit.

Jenna sat up straight.

She grabbed a calculator and punched in numbers rapidly.

"E-tricycle—$300. Display racks—$80. Initial inventory—$1,000..."

Compared to the hundreds of thousands needed for a restaurant, this was pocket change.

The washing machine beeped.

She got up to hang the laundry, still running calculations in her head.

"Clothing has higher margins than jewelry," she murmured.

Online vendor guides claimed summer outfits cost under $20 but could sell for $50-60 at night markets.

Milo's summer break had two weeks left.

His post-surgery recovery required another fortnight.

Perfect timing to prepare.

She opened a map app, marking popular night market locations.

A notification popped up.

The jewelry vendor had replied to her DM:

"Newbies should scout locations first. Urban Management patrols start at 7:30pm. Get a foldable table—you can pack up in 3 seconds when they come!"

Jenna burst out laughing.

She could already picture herself weaving through the night market with her e-tricycle.

This hands-on way of earning money gave her an unexpected sense of security.

Far better than staring at a computer screen in some office.

"Decision made." She clenched her fist.

Her notepad was filled with inventory lists and budgets.

Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting dappled shadows across her face.

For the first time, the path ahead seemed crystal clear.
###Chapter 269

Jenna Roland stared at her phone screen and suddenly burst out laughing.

This netizen's startup advice was refreshingly practical.

"Is being strong considered an advantage?" she typed quickly and hit send.

The message showed "read" instantly.

The other person was clearly glued to their phone.

A reply popped up: "Street vending is much simpler than opening a store. You only need twenty to thirty grand in startup capital, and you don't even need a business license."

Before Jenna could respond, two more messages followed.

"Have you decided what to sell?"

"If it's accessories, I can recommend my regular wholesale market. The owner is super nice."

Jenna deleted her draft and typed: "I want to sell clothes. Accessories have too many varieties—I'm afraid I'll mix up the prices."

"What a coincidence! The wholesale market I go to has a women's clothing section right next door."

"How's the pricing?"

"Ten to thirty bucks per piece, with bulk discounts. Mainly targeting girls aged 15 to 25."

"Where is it?"

"The Garment Wholesale Center. They have everything there."

Jenna's eyes lit up as her fingers flew across the screen: "Perfect! Can you take me there tomorrow? Oh, by the way, I'm Jenna."

"I'm Hannah! Just call me Hannah!"

They agreed to meet at the Garment Wholesale Center entrance at nine the next morning.

After exiting the chat app, Jenna flopped onto the couch, giggling uncontrollably.

She'd always thought about working a regular job to support herself and her brother. Becoming her own boss had never crossed her mind.

Just the thought of running her own street stall made her heart race with excitement.

She'd already mapped it out in her head: if the street vending business took off, she'd open a clothing boutique someday.

Taking a deep breath, she felt invigorated.

Youth was her greatest asset. Maybe this could really change her fate.

If she could earn enough, she and her brother might finally have a brighter future.

Lost in her dreams of prosperity, her phone vibrated against her stomach.

The caller ID read "Grandma Blanche."

"Grandma," Jenna answered promptly.

"Jenna, dear, what are you up to?" The elderly woman's kind voice came through.

Jenna sat up straight. "Just finished washing the bedsheets. Did you need something?"

"It's this Saturday—have you checked the menu? Can you come by at six in the morning?"

Back when she worked at the club, she could never wake up that early.

But things were different now.

"No problem. I'll be there at six sharp," Jenna agreed cheerfully.
###Chapter 270

"Jenna, I appreciate your help." Grandma Blanche's kind voice came through the phone.

Jenna's lips curved slightly. "Grandma, you've been so good to me. This is nothing."

"The birthday banquet will be crowded. Some people might say unpleasant things. Don't take them to heart."

"Maybe I should just help in the kitchen?"

"Absolutely not!" Blanche's tone turned firm. "You're my grandson's wife. You'll sit at the main table. Treat the gossip as background noise."

After hanging up, Jenna fell into thought. Now that she and Ethan were officially married, showing up empty-handed to his grandmother's birthday would be inappropriate.

She threw on a jacket and rode her e-bike straight to the downtown mall.

As she entered the lobby, her phone rang. Tristan Ashcroft informed her the transfer was complete and told her to check.

Jenna opened her banking app—her pupils dilated instantly. $1.7 million! During her time at the club, she'd earned $1.7 million!

"Perfect!" The involuntary exclamation drew curious glances from passersby.

She was about to pocket her phone when another call came through. Seeing "Victor Roland" on the screen made her brow furrow.

"What?" Her voice was icy.

"Tomorrow at 5 PM. Mr. Chow. Don't be late." Victor's tone brooked no argument.

Only then did Jenna remember the long-forgotten arrangement. "Got it." She ended the call abruptly.

Turning toward the jewelry section, she stopped before a luxury international brand's display.

A meticulously made-up sales associate sauntered over. But upon noticing Jenna's faded jeans and worn crossbody bag, her lips curled in derision.

"Feel free to browse." The woman crossed her arms, gaze dripping with condescension.

Jenna met her eyes calmly. Her fingertips tapped lightly against the glass countertop.
###Chapter 271

A pitch-black Rolls-Royce Phantom glided to a stop before the main entrance of Mall of America.

A young man who appeared to be an assistant swiftly exited the vehicle and respectfully opened the rear door.

A pair of long legs emerged first. The man wore an impeccably tailored black designer suit, his chiseled profile gilded with cold sunlight. His elegant gesture of adjusting his cufflinks exuded aristocratic refinement, radiating an aura that warned strangers to keep their distance.

Pedestrians stopped in their tracks.

"Look! Isn't that the HM Group CEO from the finance magazine cover?"

"He's even more handsome in person! Those proportions are unreal!"

"That watch on his wrist could buy an apartment!"

Ethan Roscente ignored the commotion, striding purposefully toward the mall entrance. His assistant Gavin Valentine jogged to keep up, unable to resist teasing. "Boss, your entrance rivals A-list celebrities."

The CEO didn't even glance his way.

Just inside the doors, Ethan suddenly halted. Gavin nearly collided with his back. "What's wrong?"

Ethan pulled out his phone. "Cancel the car." He hung up after the brief order.

His gaze locked onto a cosmetics counter ten meters away. A girl with a high ponytail was testing lipstick, her slim waist accentuated by light blue jeans.

"Jenna Roland." Ethan's voice lowered.

Gavin craned his neck. "Where? It's packed in here..."

"Blue jeans." Ethan snapped impatiently.

After squinting for several seconds, Gavin finally spotted the背影. He turned back in disbelief. "You recognized her from this distance?" Deliberately drawing out his words, he added, "Thought you were getting divorced?"

Ethan shot him an icy look. "Get your prescription checked."

With that, he strode toward the counter. Gavin muttered under his breath, "Who's he kidding? He's obviously still obsessed."
###Chapter 272

Jenna Roland stood before the jewelry counter, her gaze locked on an exquisite emerald necklace.

The gem's lush green hue would complement Grandma Blanche's porcelain skin and aristocratic grace perfectly.

"May I see this necklace, please?" Jenna pointed at the emerald behind the glass, her voice soft.

The saleswoman gave her a sidelong glance, lips curling in disdain. "This costs three million. You couldn't afford the repairs if you damaged it."

Jenna's pupils contracted. She hadn't expected such an exorbitant price—her bank balance couldn't cover half.

"Don't touch what you can't buy." The clerk smirked. "Try the flea market. That's more your speed."

Heat flooded Jenna's cheeks. She clenched her fists, fighting the urge to walk away.

The woman pressed on: "Trash like you shouldn't even be in this mall. You're bad luck!"

The words stabbed like knives. Jenna whirled around, eyes blazing. "Your job is to serve customers, not judge them!"

The clerk blinked, then sneered. "I only serve people with money. Beggars like you aren't worth my time."

Other shoppers turned to stare. Jenna's blood boiled, but she couldn't deny the truth—she was broke.

"Remember this moment." Jenna enunciated each word. "Your snobbery will cost you someday."

The saleswoman laughed theatrically. "I'll be waiting for your grand return, Miss Roland!"

Jenna strode away without looking back, nails biting into her palms. This humiliation wouldn't go unanswered.
###Chapter 273

Gavin Valentine stood in the crowd, about to call out to Jenna Roland. Suddenly, Ethan Roscente grabbed his arm and pulled him behind a marble pillar.

"What are you doing?" Gavin frowned.

Ethan's gaze was locked on the counter, his jaw clenched tight.

"Your wife is being humiliated, and you're just watching?" Gavin hissed in disbelief. "Even if you don't love her, she's still your wife in name!"

The moment the words left his mouth, Gavin regretted them.

Ethan's expression darkened dangerously, a storm of fury swirling in his eyes.

"Sorry, I shouldn't have said that." Gavin swallowed hard. "Just calm down—"

Ethan's knuckles turned white. He'd never imagined a stranger's actions could provoke such rage in him.

Five minutes later, a sweating man in a white dress shirt rushed over.

The moment Huang Teng spotted Ethan, his legs nearly gave out.

"M-Mr. Roscente?"

Three sales associates hurried over, bowing nervously.

Gavin raised an eyebrow. He hadn't expected Ethan to summon the mall manager directly.

Ethan's icy stare settled on the haughty salesgirl.

"Yan Yan Jiang." His voice could freeze hell.

The smirk on Yan Yan's face stiffened.

Huang Teng barked, "Did you offend Mr. Roscente?"

"I didn't!" Yan Yan's voice trembled. "I've never even met—"

A crowd began gathering, drawn by the commotion.
###Chapter 274

Gavin's gaze sharpened like a blade. "You didn't offend him? You just publicly humiliated that woman!"

Lily froze as a memory flashed through her mind.

Her eyes widened. "That...that penniless woman I insulted?"

Gavin's lips curled in mockery. "Penniless? You called her white trash and wanted to put up a sign saying 'No beggars or dogs allowed' at the mall entrance. Lily, your mouth is truly vicious."

Her face turned ashen. "How...how could you..."

Gavin cut her off with a cold laugh. "I was there. You were just blind."

She trembled. "What's...her connection to you?"

He looked down at her with disdain. "You're not worthy of knowing. Today, you've messed with the wrong person."

Her legs gave out as she collapsed to her knees before Ethan. "Mr. Roscente! I didn't know she knew you! I was wrong! Please forgive me!"

Ethan glanced down, his icy gaze sweeping over her shaking form.

He turned to Tony. "Destroy this boutique."

Tony stumbled back. "Sir, this is..."

Gavin barked, "Do as he says!"

Sweat beaded on Tony's forehead as he summoned four bodyguards.

The sound of shattering glass filled the air as jewelry scattered across the floor.

Lily and the clerks huddled together, screaming.

The crowd gasped.

This was a multi-million dollar jewelry store!

Ethan's cold eyes swept over the phone-wielding onlookers. "Anyone who uploads footage will face consequences."

Every phone immediately lowered.

He turned back to Tony. "She covers the damages. This brand is permanently banned from my properties."

Lily collapsed. "Mr. Roscente! You can't do this!"

Suddenly, she lunged at him.

A dangerous glint flashed in Ethan's eyes as he kicked her away.

"Get out!"

She crashed to the floor, blood trickling from her lips.

The crowd recoiled with shocked murmurs.

Without another word, Ethan strode away.

He'd come to select a birthday gift for Grandma Blanche, only to witness Jenna being humiliated.

Now his mood was thoroughly ruined.

Gavin smirked and quickly followed.
###Chapter 275

Jenna Roland left Mall of America empty-handed after failing to find a suitable gift. She headed to a renowned jade boutique instead.

After careful selection, she purchased a high-quality emerald bracelet for twenty-eight thousand dollars.

On the drive back to Beverly Hills, Jenna grew increasingly irritated. The condescending saleswoman's smug expression kept replaying in her mind.

She should've slapped that woman right then.

Or reported her to the mall manager.

At the very least, she could've filmed the counter and posted it online.

Jenna bit her lower lip in frustration. Regret was pointless now—today just wasn't her day.

......

At six in the evening, the aroma of dinner filled the air as the front door unlocked.

Ethan Roscente entered, cradling a fresh bouquet of sunflowers.

"More flowers?" Jenna emerged from the kitchen, drying her hands. "Last week's bouquet hasn't even wilted yet."

"These bloomed better." Ethan handed her the flowers and loosened his tie.

Jenna accepted them. "Wash up for dinner. I'll arrange these."

Ethan went straight to the bathroom.

Jenna retrieved the glass vase from the dining table, discarded the old flowers, and meticulously cleaned the container. She filled it with fresh water, trimmed the stems, and arranged the sunflowers.

When she returned to the dining room, Ethan was already seated.

"I'll serve the rice." Jenna set down the vase and headed to the kitchen.

Two bowls of steamed rice later, she took her seat across from Ethan.

Only the clinking of cutlery broke the silence.

After ten quiet minutes, Ethan spoke abruptly. "Did you get Grandma Blanche's birthday gift?"

"I did." Jenna picked at her greens. "She is family, after all."

Ethan set down his chopsticks and disappeared into their bedroom. He returned with a velvet jewelry box.

"Use this." He slid it toward her.

Jenna shook her head. "I already bought something."

"This is non-negotiable." His tone brooked no argument.

Blanche's banquet would be attended by high-profile guests. Letting his wife present an ordinary gift would disgrace the Roscente name.

Only this Burmese emerald bracelet suited such an occasion.

"But I already spent money—" Jenna muttered under her breath.

Ethan's gaze turned icy. "Why didn't you consult me first?"

"It was my own money." Jenna stared at her rice. "Not yours."

Ethan froze.
###Chapter 276

Shunfu's pupils contracted sharply as he frantically signaled the guards to intervene.

But Lady Song moved too swiftly for the imperial guards to react.

Thud.

A dull impact echoed through the hall.

Lady Song's forehead collided violently with the vermilion pillar, blood gushing instantly.

Song Yu's eyes nearly burst from their sockets as she broke free from the Imperial Guards and lunged toward her mother.

"Mother!"

Her voice was hoarse, brimming with venomous hatred.

Yet that hatred was directed solely at Tangta.

Song Yu never reflected on her own faults—she only knew how to shift blame onto others.

"Summon the imperial physician at once!"

Shunfu stamped his foot in agitation.

If the Song matriarch died within the palace walls, it would incite outrage among the military generals.

Emperor Si would also be branded as heartless and ungrateful.

"By His Majesty's decree, Song Yu is to be taken into custody immediately!"

Lin Chong drew his sword and stepped forward.

Song Yu's eyes burned crimson as she prepared to resist.

"General Song, do you intend to stage a rebellion in the imperial palace?"

Lin Chong smirked, his gaze laced with mockery.

The War King truly had a way with women—playing both sides effortlessly.

With just a nod from him, the War King's estate would soon celebrate a double wedding.

But what of Mingta?

Had that brilliant, spirited woman ever received even a shred of the War King's genuine affection?

Lin Chong still remembered Mingta rallying the Imperial Guards to raise funds.

Why was fate so unjust?

"Emperor Si, you are utterly merciless!"

Song Yu threw her head back and laughed wildly.

"My brother was truly blind!"

Her entire body trembled before she finally ceased resisting.

The Imperial Guards pinned her down forcefully.

"Enough!"

Emperor Si abruptly rose to his feet.

His bloodshot eyes swept over the officials gathered outside the hall.

The Crown Prince's faction immediately fell silent.

None doubted that one more word would result in Emperor Si executing someone on the spot.

"I have long known of Song Yu's deception—posing as a man."

Emperor Si closed his eyes briefly.

"If punishment is required, I alone shall bear the responsibility."

His heart pounded like a drum, but he reassured himself—it didn't matter. He would explain everything to Tangta.

He would keep Song Yu far away from her.

"The War King means to say...?"

Shunfu ventured cautiously.

Every eye in the hall fixed on Emperor Si.

Hope flickered in Song Yu's gaze as fresh tears spilled over.

He did care for her after all.

"Yes."

Emperor Si gritted his teeth and spat out the single word.

Song Yu wept with joy.

Lin Chong and Zhenghe exchanged glances, their expressions dripping with scorn.

How long had it been since Mingta's departure?

And already the War King's estate prepared for celebration.

Who still remembered that radiant woman who shone like the morning sun?
###Chapter 277

Morning sunlight spilled across the streets as Jenna Roland weaved through rush hour traffic on her e-bike.

The sign of the Garment Wholesale Center glittered under the sun.

She arrived thirty minutes early, standing at the entrance and checking her watch repeatedly.

"Excuse me, are you Jenna?" A crisp female voice came from behind.

Hannah Kalmien wore a simple T-shirt and jeans, her hair tied in a high ponytail. She looked even more energetic than in their video calls.

After exchanging pleasantries, Hannah led Jenna into the wholesale center with practiced ease.

"The first floor mainly deals with accessories and women's clothing. The second floor has children's wear and swimsuits..."

Hannah gave a tour while Jenna's eyes darted between shops.

Her steps noticeably slowed when they passed stores with "Factory Direct" signs.

"This T-shirt only costs $2 wholesale?" Jenna ran her fingers over the fabric, disbelief in her voice.

Hannah chuckled. "These are the source manufacturers. Prices are naturally low."

By the time they finished exploring the women's section, Jenna's notebook was filled with prices and styles.

"I want to start my stall tomorrow!" Jenna exclaimed excitedly.

Hannah cautioned her, "Don't rush. We need to scout locations and select the right inventory first."

They settled at a diner near the wholesale center.

Jenna ordered house specialties and thanked Hannah sincerely.

"The hardest part about street vending isn't the hard work," Hannah said between bites. "It's persistence."

Jenna nodded thoughtfully.

When they parted, they agreed to visit night market stalls together the following week.

Back at Beverly Hills, Jenna organized her findings into spreadsheets.

At four p.m., she changed into a simple dress and headed to Mr. Chow.

The window-side table offered a clear view. Jenna sipped lemon water as she waited.

Ten minutes later, familiar figures appeared at the entrance.

Victor Roland and Fiona Roland walked in first, followed by Jason Roland and his scowling wife Heidi.

"Over here." Jenna raised her hand.

Heidi shoved a bulging plastic bag onto the table.

"For you," she said stiffly.

Jenna arched an eyebrow. "Poisoned?"

"You—!" Heidi's face turned livid.

Victor placed a restraining hand on his wife's arm. "Your father appeared in my dream. He asked me to look after you."

Jenna scoffed. "At least make up a believable story."

The waiter arrived with menus, temporarily diffusing the tension.
###Chapter 278

"Believe it or not." Victor Roland snorted, his eyes flickering with unease.

Fiona Roland pulled a manila envelope from her crocodile leather purse and slid it toward Jenna. "The orchard transfer agreement. Just sign it."

Jenna eyed them warily, her fingers tracing the edges before opening it. She scrutinized every clause, every punctuation mark.

Black ink on white paper—it was indeed a legitimate contract.

"After scheming to steal that orchard, you're suddenly willing to give it back?" Jenna tossed the document onto the coffee table and crossed her arms. "Or did karma finally catch up?"

Victor sighed. "We've made enough over the years. Your father was right—greed destroys." He rubbed his hands. "The orchard was always yours."

Jenna narrowed her eyes. Since when did this fox change its nature?

"You sign first." She pushed the contract back.

Victor took the pen Jason handed him and scrawled his signature. The ink bled across the paper like an ominous stain.

"Convinced now?" He slid it toward her.

Jenna smirked. "Don't think this erases everything." She stuffed the contract into her bag. "We're done here."

Victor's eyes reddened. "I failed you and your brother—"

"Save it." Jenna cut him off, nails digging into her palms.

Under the chandelier's glow, a vein throbbed at Victor's temple. Fiona stomped on his foot under the table.

Waiters began serving dishes. Jenna picked up a piece of sweet-and-sour ribs—tender, glistening with glaze.

"Any plans for the orchard?" Victor asked casually.

"Rebuilding it. Not your concern." She dabbed her lips and excused herself.

The moment Jenna left, Fiona swiftly pulled a small vial from her Hermès bag. White powder dusted the tiramisu as she swapped the dessert plates.

"Mom, what if—" Jason's voice shook.

Fiona's red lips curved. "Then we take her by force."
###Chapter 279

Fiona Roland had long studied Jenna Roland's habits. She knew Jenna always ordered mango pudding as dessert whenever she dined at Mr. Chow.

This was her carefully planned first move.

If this failed, she had an even more ruthless backup plan.

As a last resort, she would simply drug Jenna. Without audio or video evidence, Jenna couldn't prove anything even if she went to the police.

When Jenna returned from the restroom, her expression had visibly relaxed.

She had secretly called Attorney Hugo Valence under the pretense of using the bathroom to confirm contract details. He assured her the orchard would legally become hers once the documents were signed and notarized.

"Give me the keys." Jenna sat down and extended her hand. "The ones to the orchard's pump house and fertilizer storage."

Victor Roland slowly unclipped the keychain from his belt, picking out two keys before tossing them onto the table.

Fiona smoothly slid an exquisite mango pudding toward Jenna. "Try this. It's their signature dessert."

Jenna glanced at the surveillance camera in the ceiling corner and smirked. "You didn't drug this, did you?"

Fiona's smile froze momentarily before she laughed. "There are cameras everywhere. Drugging you here would be suicidal. I have no intention of going back to prison."

Jenna considered this reasonable and took a few bites with her spoon. She pocketed the keys and stood to leave.

"Need a ride?" Jason Roland asked with feigned concern.

"A fox offering condolences to a chicken." Jenna scoffed. "I have my own transportation."

She strode out without looking back.

By the time Victor finished paying the bill and the three hurried outside, they found Jenna slumped over her e-bike's handlebars.

"What's wrong? Not feeling well?" Fiona pretended to sound worried.

Jenna's vision spun as her limbs turned to lead. She struggled to lift her head but found even this simple movement impossible.

"Your mother had hypoglycemia. Maybe you inherited it?" Victor remarked pointedly.

Jenna's stomach dropped. She hadn't brought any candy, but she'd never experienced symptoms like this before.
###Chapter 280

Jenna Roland felt dizzy, her throat parched as if scorched by fire.

She parted her lips to ask for candy to ease the discomfort.

But the memory of their earlier actions made her swallow the words.

Fiona Roland sidled up with feigned concern. "You can't ride like this. Let Jason take you to the hospital before it gets worse."

Victor Roland grew impatient at her silence. "Jason is still your cousin. Stop dawdling and get in the car!"

Jenna knew this wasn't the time to argue. She gave a reluctant nod.

Jason and Fiona flanked her, shoving her into the black sedan.

The moment her head touched the seat, darkness swallowed her vision. Consciousness slipped away.

Fiona shook her dramatically. "Jenna? Jenna! What's wrong?"

Jenna slumped against her shoulder, limp and unresponsive.

Heidi Roland turned from the passenger seat, whispering, "Did it work?"

A cold smile curled Fiona's lips. "Of course."

Victor barked orders. "Jason, drive straight to the hotel!"

The car sped off.

Fiona rifled through Jenna's bag, shredding the contract. She tossed two keys to Victor.

He weighed them in his palm with a sneer. "No matter how careful this bitch was, she still fell into our hands."

Fiona smirked. "Even the slyest fox can't outsmart skilled hunters."

Heidi bit her lip. "The restaurant had cameras. What if—"

Fiona waved her off. "The camera was behind me. It couldn't catch me drugging my own dessert. Who can prove anything?"

Victor frowned. "What if someone asks why you gave her your dessert?"

Fiona shrugged. "I'll say I didn't like it and passed it to her."

Victor grinned. "Brilliant!"

Fiona rolled her eyes. "If I left it to you fools, we wouldn't have even gotten near her."

Jason chimed in from the driver's seat. "Mom, you're the brains of this family!"

Fiona preened. "Remember—if she dares report this, we deny everything. One slip-up, and we all go down."

Victor thumped his chest. "My lips are sealed."

Heidi admired her manicure. "Over a million dollars and my designer bag? I'm not talking."

Having done prison time before, Jason and Fiona took no chances.

Thirty minutes later, the car stopped at the hotel's back entrance.

Four men stood waiting.

The lead man had a beer belly, greasy skin, and reeked of body odor.

His ill-fitting custom suit and Patek Philippe watch silently declared his wealth.
###Chapter 281

Fiona Roland immediately recognized the well-dressed man before her—Howard Wennington, the real estate tycoon of Los Angeles!

She plastered on an obsequious smile, hunching her back as she scurried forward. "Mr. Wennington, we've brought her, just as promised. She's in the backseat. Would you like to take a look?"

Howard narrowed his eyes and nodded, strolling over to Jason Roland's car. Victor Roland eagerly yanked the door open, revealing Jenna Roland's unconscious form.

Jenna's skin was porcelain-pale, her slender legs barely visible beneath the hem of her dress. The sight of her delicate features and alluring figure made Howard's Adam's apple bob.

He reached out with thick fingers, grazing them along Jenna's thigh. The smooth texture made his breath hitch.

"Not bad. Exactly my taste." Howard withdrew his hand with satisfaction and snapped his fingers.

A black-suited bodyguard immediately handed over a bulging duffel bag.

Fiona snatched it, hastily unzipping it. When she saw the stacks of cash inside, her eyes crinkled into slits.

"Enjoy yourself, Mr. Wennington!" She bowed obsequiously before clutching the bag of money and scrambling into the car.

Victor hovered nervously. "Shouldn't we count it? What if it's short—"

"Are you stupid?" Fiona rolled her eyes. "A man like Mr. Wennington could drop crumbs from his fingers and we'd eat for half a year!"

She shook the bag triumphantly, the weight of it sending thrills through her.

Victor couldn't resist counting anyway. When he reached $1.3 million, he grabbed Fiona and planted a sloppy kiss on her cheek. "You're amazing, honey!"

"Let's go shopping!" Heidi Roland cheered, slapping the car seat excitedly.

Jason hit the gas, and the car sped toward the mall.

Jenna's head throbbed as she forced her eyes open. The unfamiliar ceiling jolted her awake.

The sound of running water from the bathroom turned her blood to ice.

She bolted upright, scanning the room—this wasn't a hospital!

Memories crashed over her. The suspicious drink at the restaurant. Victor's fake concern...

"Bastards!" She clenched the sheets, nails digging into her palms.

Her own family had sold her out.
###Chapter 282

Jenna Roland's eyes flew open as she found herself lying on an unfamiliar bed.

The room was lavishly decorated, yet suffocatingly oppressive.

She flexed her fingers experimentally, feeling the drug's effects gradually wearing off.

Crude voices filtered through the door.

"This chick's a real looker—way hotter than the boss's usual picks."

"Heard she's untouched. The boss hit the jackpot this time."

Jenna's heart plummeted.

Moving silently, she pressed her ear against the door.

Footsteps approached.

She retreated swiftly, scanning the room for escape routes.

The balcony!

Barefoot, she dashed toward the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Icy wind slapped her face as she pushed the glass open.

The seven-story drop made her vision swim.

Her phone!

Jenna sprinted back to grab her purse from the nightstand.

Trembling fingers dialed 911.

The call connected just as she spotted a familiar figure below.

Ethan Roscente was striding into the hotel flanked by his men, his black Maybach idling at the curb.

She immediately ended the emergency call.

"Ethan!" Her shaking fingers redialed his number.

The first attempt went straight to voicemail.

On the second try, his voice cut through like shards of ice: "What?"

"I'm on the seventh floor! I've been kidnapped!" she whispered urgently.

The door burst open.

Heath Roland stood frozen in the doorway, his bathrobe gaping open. Fury twisted his features.

"You bitch!" He lunged.

Jenna gripped the window frame like a lifeline.

"Stay back!" she snarled.

Heath's eyes gleamed with malice. "Should've taken the easy way out."

With a violent yank, he flung the window wide open.

Jenna's back hit the railing.

Her knees buckled at the dizzying height.

"Ethan..." The name became a silent prayer.

Heath advanced with a grotesque smile. "Go on. Jump."

Her phone creaked under white-knuckled pressure.

Suddenly, pounding footsteps echoed in the hallway.

Heath whirled around.

Before he could react, the door exploded inward.

Ethan stormed in with four bodyguards.

"Mr. Roscente?" Heath stumbled backward.

Ethan's gaze locked onto Jenna at the balcony's edge.

"Come here." He extended his hand.

Tears spilled down her cheeks as she staggered into his arms.

Heath turned ashen. "This is just a misunder—"

"Take him." Ethan's command sliced through the excuse.

Bodyguards seized Heath instantly.

Jenna trembled violently, fists clenched in Ethan's shirt.

"It's over." His palm brushed her back.

The words were clinical, yet they wrapped around her like armor.
###Chapter 283

Jenna's nails dug deep into her palms, the pain keeping her alert.

She glared at the man before her, eyes blazing with defiance.

Henry loosened his tie with deliberate slowness, a smug smile playing on his lips. "Stop resisting. You're mine tonight."

A metallic tang flooded her mouth as Jenna bit her tongue. With a sudden burst of strength, she kicked the nearest bodyguard.

The man staggered back, caught off guard.

"Useless!" Henry's face darkened. "Three grown men can't handle one woman?"

The bodyguards tightened their grip, pinning her down. Beads of sweat formed on Jenna's forehead.

"Ethan will make you pay," she rasped, voice raw like a wounded animal.

Henry threw his head back laughing. He leaned in, gripping her chin. "By the time he finds you, it'll be too late."

Sirens wailed in the distance. Everyone froze.

A flicker of hope flashed in Jenna's eyes—then died just as quickly. Henry calmly pulled out his phone.

"Zhang? It's me. Got a small situation..." He gestured for the bodyguards to continue while speaking.

Jenna thrashed violently, twisting the bedsheets into knots. With a sudden jerk, she headbutted Henry's nose.

"Ah!" Blood gushed down his face as he roared, "Hold her down!"

The bodyguards scrambled to restrain her. Panting heavily, strands of hair stuck to her flushed face—but her gaze remained unbroken.

"You think this scares me?" Henry wiped his bloody nose with a sneer. "Not even God could save you tonight."

Jenna went eerily still. A strange smile curved her lips. "Try me."

The door exploded inward before the words fully left her mouth.
###Chapter 284

Jenna's response made Henry Ho finally understand this woman would never submit willingly.

Since soft tactics didn't work, he'd resort to force.

Henry's eyes darkened as he glared at his three bodyguards. "Strip her. After I'm done, you can have your turn."

"You monster! You'll pay for this!" Jenna's eyes burned with fury, her nails digging into her palms.

Henry smirked and signaled his men.

Just as the bodyguards reached for Jenna's collar, the door burst open with a crash.

Ethan Roscente stormed in with a team of security personnel, followed by three sharply dressed men in suits.

"Stop." Ethan's voice was glacial.

"Ethan!" Jenna's voice trembled.

The bodyguards froze but kept their grip on her.

Henry exploded with rage. "Who the hell are you? Get out!"

Ethan narrowed his eyes, radiating danger.

The bodyguards instinctively released Jenna and retreated behind Henry.

Arrogant with his powerful connections, Henry sneered. "Are you deaf? I said get lost!"

The three men behind Ethan exchanged glances, silently lighting a candle for this fool's impending doom.

Jenna quickly moved behind Ethan, her tense nerves finally easing.

"Say that again." Ethan's voice dropped low, his knuckles cracking faintly.

Henry jutted his chin. "I said get out! Can't you understand human speech?"

"Interesting." A cold smile curled Ethan's lips. "You're the first to dare speak to me like that."

Henry scoffed. "Stop pretending to be some big shot. Last warning—leave now, or I'll have you carried out."

Ethan's gaze turned icy. "What if I refuse?"

Henry snapped. "Break his legs!" he roared at his bodyguards.
###Chapter 285

The three bodyguards of Hugo Valence trembled under Ethan Roscente's menacing aura, their legs turning to jelly as they hesitated to advance.

Hugo's face twisted with rage when he saw their cowardice. "Are you deaf? Attack him now!" he bellowed.

The lead bodyguard swallowed hard. "Boss... we—we really can't..."

"Can't?" Hugo's eyes bulged with fury. "I pay you a fortune! Even let you have fun with women on my dime! And now you're chickening out?"

His words turned the guards' faces ashen. Hugo treated them like disposable trash.

If not for their unpaid wages, they would've walked away long ago.

"Final warning!" Hugo snarled, veins popping on his forehead. "If you don't move, you won't see a single cent!"

Exchanging grim looks, the three men clenched their teeth and charged at Ethan.

Ethan didn't flinch. As the first guard lunged, he seized the man's wrist in a lightning-fast motion and executed a flawless shoulder throw, slamming him onto the floor.

Before the other two could react, Ethan leapt into the air—his right leg whipping like a steel cable across one's chest while his left swept the other's throat.

A dull thud echoed as both guards crashed against the wall.

Hugo's jaw dropped, his lips quivering. "You—"

Jenna Roland stared in shock. She never imagined this refined man possessed such lethal skills.

Had she not witnessed it herself, she wouldn't have believed Ethan could take down three trained men single-handedly.

Ethan's eyes turned glacial, his knuckles cracking ominously.

He advanced on Hugo, his voice dripping with frost. "Care to repeat what you just said?"

Hugo staggered backward, screaming hysterically at his downed guards. "Useless trash! Get up or forfeit your pay!"

Groaning in pain, the three men struggled to their feet and attacked again—only to be swiftly knocked down by Ethan's ruthless strikes.

Cornered against the balcony railing, Hugo trembled violently.

"Y-you dare touch me..." he blustered, though fear laced his voice. "I'll have you rotting in prison!"

The three suited men accompanying Ethan shook their heads in pity. Provoking Ethan was a death wish.

Ethan seized Hugo's throat, his grip icy. "Why is she here?"

Hugo's Adam's apple bobbed, his back drenched in cold sweat.
###Chapter 286

He Hongwen trembled violently, his teeth chattering. "I...I paid for her."

"Oh?" Ethan Roscente narrowed his eyes, his voice icy. "From whom?"

Just as He Hongwen opened his mouth, Jenna Roland peeked out from behind Ethan. "Was it Victor and Fiona Roland?"

He Hongwen swallowed hard, sweat beading on his forehead. "No...it was some guy named Qin Zhengjun."

"Qin Zhengjun?" Jenna's pupils constricted sharply. "Who's that?"

"I just bought her." He Hongwen shrank back. "I don't know where he got you from."

Jenna suddenly grabbed his collar. "I asked you who Qin Zhengjun is!"

"Talk." Ethan spat the single word.

Trapped between two murderous glares, He Hongwen recoiled. "I really don't know! I've only heard the name!"

Qin Zhengjun?

Jenna released him, her nails digging deep into her palms. She'd spent over a decade with the Roland family and had never heard that name.

Besides Sophia Merouin recently, she hadn't offended anyone else.

Could it be someone from the club holding a grudge?

Ethan didn't waste words. His fist smashed into He Hongwen's face. A hook followed, then a brutal kick between the legs.

"Ah—!" He Hongwen curled into a fetal position, his face contorted in agony.

Ethan looked down at him coldly. "Be grateful you didn't touch her. Otherwise..." He ground his shoe slightly. "Sterilization would've been the least of your worries."

"Let's go." He turned to Jenna.

She grabbed her bag, casting one last glance at the moaning man on the floor.

The elevator doors slid shut.

Jenna stared at the descending floor numbers. "Thank you."

Ethan frowned at his bruised knuckles. "Disgusting."

Her body stiffened, fingers tightening around her bag strap. Was he calling her dirty?

"Not you." Ethan noticed her whitened knuckles.

Her shoulders relaxed slightly. "Sorry for dragging you into this."

"What happened?" Ethan turned to her, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Why were you brought to a hotel?"
###Chapter 287

Jenna Roland rubbed her temples, trying to recall. "Uncle Victor invited me to discuss the orchard transfer today. After dinner, I was about to ride my e-bike home when I suddenly felt dizzy and weak."

Her voice trembled slightly. "When they saw me unsteady, they insisted on taking me to the hospital. But after getting in the car, I blacked out. The next thing I knew, I woke up in that room..."

Ethan Roscente's gaze turned icy, the air around him chilling. "Your uncle sold you out?"

"I'm not sure," Jenna bit her lip. "But the man at the hotel said he bought me from Brian Durrant. I just don’t understand why I ended up there."

"Find out." Ethan's tone was frigid.

"I will." Jenna clenched her fists. If her own family had betrayed her, she wouldn’t hold back.

The elevator reached the lobby. Three suited executives trailed behind Ethan, exchanging uneasy glances.

"Here for an inspection?" Jenna glanced at the men behind him.

"Yes." Ethan remained expressionless. "There’s an issue with the hotel’s plumbing system. Brought the team to check it."

The executives' eyes widened. They were here for an acquisition meeting! Since when had it turned into a plumbing inspection? And why was their CEO lying so blatantly?

Jenna nodded. "I’ll go retrieve my bike then."

As she walked away, Ethan turned and pressed the elevator button. The executives stayed silent, not daring to ask a single question.

Mayo Clinic, VIP Ward.

Justin Kemnis lay bruised and swollen on the hospital bed, an IV drip attached to his left arm. Beside him stood an imposing middle-aged man—Deputy Mayor Hugo Valence.

"What happened?" Hugo frowned. He’d rushed over after receiving his brother’s frantic call.

Justin’s eyes reddened instantly. "Brother! Someone nearly crippled me! You have to make them pay!"

"Who did this?" Hugo’s voice dropped dangerously. No one in Los Angeles dared lay a finger on his family.
###Chapter 288

He Hongwen lay on the hospital bed, his face as pale as paper.

His lips trembled as he spoke, his voice laced with unprecedented fear. "Brother, I almost got crippled!"

He Hongtian's brow furrowed, a flicker of shock flashing in his eyes. His younger brother had always been arrogant and domineering, relying on the He family's influence to bully others without ever suffering consequences.

"Who did this?" He Hongtian's voice was low.

He Hongwen gritted his teeth. "A bastard named Ethan Roscente! I had my eye on a fresh girl, just paid a million for her, and that guy barged in with his men..."

He Hongtian shot to his feet, the chair screeching against the floor.

"Ethan Roscente?" His voice rose sharply. "Are you sure it was him?"

Startled by his brother's reaction, He Hongwen stammered, "Y-yes! It was him!"

He Hongtian quickly pulled out his phone, flipping to a photo of Ethan and shoving it in front of his brother.

"Is this him?"

He Hongwen glared at the screen, fury burning in his eyes. "That's the bastard!"

He Hongtian's face turned ashen. He paced back and forth, his fingers tapping unconsciously against the hospital bed railing.

"What's his connection to that woman?"

He Hongwen shook his head. "No idea. He was just there to rescue her."

He Hongtian slammed his fist against the wall with a dull thud.

"Of all people, you had to provoke Ethan Roscente?" His voice was thick with suppressed rage. "If he decides to come after you, even the entire He family won't be able to protect you!"

He Hongwen's pupils contracted. He tried to sit up but collapsed back onto the bed with a pained groan.

"W-what kind of background does he have?" Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. "Isn't HM Group still under Grandpa Harrison's control?"

He Hongtian scoffed. "Ethan has been the real power behind it for years! Do you think the Roscente family is still the same as before?"

Silence fell over the hospital room.

He Hongwen finally grasped the gravity of the situation, his voice trembling. "Brother, you have to save me..."

"Save you?" He Hongtian yanked at his tie in frustration. "How many times have I warned you? Now you come begging after kicking an iron plate?"

"I didn't know I'd run into someone like him..." His voice trailed off weakly.

He Hongtian stared at his brother's pallid face, a vein throbbing at his temple. This was his only sibling—the same reckless kid he'd been cleaning up after since childhood.

"I'll try." He finally sighed. "But don't get your hopes up."

A glimmer of hope flashed in He Hongwen's eyes. He nodded eagerly. "Brother, I'm counting on you!"

He Hongtian turned toward the window, gazing at the bustling traffic outside the hospital. His heart felt heavy. This time, the price would be steep.
###Chapter 289

The night was deep when Jenna Roland finally stepped through her front door at eight o'clock.

Warm light spilled from the living room where Milo Roland was curled up on the sofa watching TV.

"Sis, you're back." Milo looked up, his eyes bright.

Jenna forced a smile, careful not to let her little brother notice anything amiss.

"Are you hungry? I can grab you some late-night snacks." Milo set down the remote and started to rise.

"No need." Jenna pressed a hand to his shoulder. "Go ahead without me. I'm exhausted."

Milo nodded obediently and grabbed his jacket on the way out.

The door opened to reveal Ethan Roscente's tall frame silhouetted in the hallway.

"Good evening, Mr. Roscente." Milo greeted him politely.

Ethan gave a slight nod. "Heading out so late?"

"Just grabbing some food." Milo scratched his head and sidestepped past him.

Only after Milo's footsteps faded toward the elevator did Ethan close the door and enter the living room.

He settled beside Jenna without ceremony, lighting a cigarette.

Through the curling smoke, his dark gaze studied her face.

"Are you alright?"

Jenna blinked, then lowered her lashes. "I'm fine."

"That man," Ethan tapped ash into the tray, "I can take care of him for you."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "He never touched me. The police wouldn't do anything."

"Then what do you want?"

"Victor Roland and his family are the real culprits." Jenna clenched her fists. "If they were behind the drugging—"

Ethan stubbed out his cigarette. "I'll find out."

"Thank you." Jenna met his eyes, a gentle smile warming her gaze.

That smile pierced Ethan's heart. The memory of what nearly happened at the hotel flashed through his mind, ice glinting in his eyes.

Whether it was Victor Roland or Jack Cardenas—none of them would walk away unscathed.

The alarm blared at 4:30 the next morning.

Ethan opened his eyes to see Jenna fumbling with her phone to silence it.

"This early?" His voice was rough with sleep.

Jenna rubbed her eyes as she sat up. "It's Grandma Blanche's birthday. I need to get to Villa d'Este early."

She yawned, still wrapped in the blanket, her hair sticking up in disarray.

Ethan watched her sleepy movements and simply hummed in response.

"Sorry for waking you. Go back to sleep." Jenna scrambled up to straighten the bedding.

As water ran in the bathroom, Ethan stared at the ceiling, lost in thought.

When Jenna emerged dressed, Ethan had closed his eyes again. She eased the door shut behind her with utmost care.

The streets were still quiet at 5 AM. Jenna scanned the neighborhood entrance and quickly hailed a cab.

"Villa d'Este, please. As fast as you can."

The driver eyed his early-bird passenger in the rearview mirror and hit the gas.

The car plunged into the morning mist, racing toward the distant estate.
###Chapter 290

Six in the morning. The sky was just beginning to lighten.

Jenna Roland's taxi sped along the winding mountain road. At this hour, the streets were nearly empty, and the driver pushed the car to its limits.

"We're here." The driver hit the brakes.

After paying the fare, Jenna stepped out. A crisp mountain breeze greeted her, making her pull her coat tighter.

A man in a white shirt stood guard at the villa's entrance, eyeing her warily.

"Who are you?" he asked with a frown.

Jenna approached quickly. "Hello, I'm Jenna Roland. Grandma Blanche recommended me as the chef."

The man's expression instantly turned respectful. "Ah, Miss Roland! I'm Tristan Ashcroft, the villa manager. Grandma Blanche specifically mentioned your arrival today."

"Grandma Blanche?" Jenna blinked in surprise.

Tristan hurried to explain. "We respectfully address all guests over sixty as 'Grandma.' Today is Grandma Blanche's birthday celebration."

Understanding dawned on Jenna. In her mind, the title "Grandma" carried an air of old-world aristocracy.

"Let me show you to the kitchen." Tristan gestured for her to follow.

The kitchen was spacious and bright, stocked with professional-grade equipment. Jenna scanned the room—some tools she'd never used before.

Tristan patiently walked her through each appliance before leading her to inspect the ingredients.

Abalone, lobster, leopard coral grouper... Eighteen premium ingredients were neatly arranged. Jenna frowned. "This much food... Will we have enough time?"

"Plenty," Tristan assured her with a smile. "The banquet starts at noon. The kitchen staff will assist you. You only need to oversee the cooking."

Jenna nodded. "Then let's begin preparations right away."

The kitchen soon buzzed with activity. Jenna directed the staff as they prepped the ingredients. Though her family was modest, her mother had often cooked seafood during their orchard days—this was familiar territory.

During a lull, Jenna started preparing braised pork knuckle. She selected prime cuts of pork belly, carefully seared the skin, scraped it clean, and sliced it into even pieces.

As the water boiled, she added cooking wine, scallions, and ginger. Her eyes remained fixed on the simmering meat as she skimmed off impurities. Five minutes later, she drained the pork and evenly brushed each piece with braising soy sauce.

The oil in the wok sizzled as Jenna carefully added the meat. Hot oil splattered, but her focus never wavered. Today was Grandma Blanche's special day—she couldn't afford any distractions.

The kitchen filled with mouthwatering aromas. Beads of sweat formed on Jenna's forehead. She wiped them away lightly and continued cooking.
###Chapter 291

Grandma Blanche and Grandpa Harrison Roscente arrived at Villa d'Este in Ethan's private car. Ethan and his grandfather went to greet the guests while Grandma Blanche headed straight for the kitchen to find Jenna Roland.

Jenna stood by the stove in her crisp white chef's coat, her dark hair pulled into a neat bun. The heavy wok danced in her hands as flames licked its base.

This was Grandma Blanche's first time watching Jenna cook. The elderly woman's eyes widened at the sight of the petite woman effortlessly maneuvering the hefty iron wok.

"Jenna dear, I had no idea you were so skilled!" Grandma Blanche approached, admiration shining in her eyes.

Jenna turned, her forehead damp with sweat. "Grandma, you shouldn't be here. The floor is slippery, and the fumes—"

Her voice carried concern. With so many guests today, she couldn't bear the thought of anything happening to the elderly woman.

Grandma Blanche waved dismissively. "Nonsense. My legs are steady as ever."

The firelight cast a rosy glow on Jenna's flushed cheeks as beads of sweat trailed down her neck. Grandma Blanche pulled out a handkerchief. "Shouldn't you take a break?"

"Four more dishes to go." Jenna smiled, her eyes reflecting the stove's flames. "The banquet starts at noon sharp. No delays allowed."

Grandma Blanche noticed the subtle change in her tone. "Has Ethan arrived?"

"He's greeting guests outside." The older woman patted Jenna's shoulder. "Come find me in the main hall when you're done."

The banquet hall was packed. Distant relatives swarmed Grandma Blanche the moment she appeared, forcing her to exchange pleasantries before retreating to the head table.

"Well?" Grandpa Harrison murmured.

"That poor girl is exhausted." Grandma Blanche sighed. "I never should have put her through this."

Grandpa Harrison shook his head. "Too late for regrets now."

Ethan sat nearby reviewing documents, his fingers tapping absently on his tablet. His assistant's report faded into background noise, but every word from his grandmother rang clear.

"Harrison, you should have seen it!" Grandma Blanche suddenly brightened. "Jenna was toss-frying like a circus performer! That tiny frame handling heavy cookware like it's nothing!"

Grandpa Harrison raised an eyebrow. "Impressive skills."

Ethan closed his file and stood. His black suit cut through the sea of red carpet as he strode toward the kitchen.
###Chapter 292

Grandma Blanche leaned closer to Grandpa Harrison with a conspiratorial whisper. "What do you think Ethan ran off to do?"

Grandpa Harrison sipped his tea leisurely. "Probably just craving a cigarette."

"I doubt that." Grandma Blanche smirked slyly. "I bet he went looking for Jenna!"

Grandpa Harrison set down his cup. "If he's that eager, it's a good sign."

"I'll check." Grandma Blanche headed toward the main hall's entrance.

The courtyard stood empty, save for Ethan smoking alone by the flower bed.

Grandma Blanche pursed her lips in disappointment. "That rascal!"

She turned back inside, missing how Ethan's gaze lingered toward the kitchen.

Ethan stood by the flower bed, the ember of his cigarette flickering. Swans glided gracefully across the pond as a white duck suddenly dove in, resurfacing with a small fish in its beak.

He stubbed out the cigarette, his eyes darting between the main hall and the kitchen.

Finally, he strode toward the kitchen.

At the doorway, Ethan paused. Through the glass door, he saw Jenna in her white chef's coat, intently stir-frying a dish.

When Jenna suddenly turned, Ethan quickly ducked behind the wall.

Once her back was to the door again, he peeked out. Watching her busy figure, the corner of his mouth lifted before he turned to leave.

Just as he reached the courtyard, Grace and Benjamin Roscente approached.

Grace, usually dressed in opulence, looked striking in a simple Chanel-style suit.

"Ethan!" Grace called out. "I heard Jenna is the head chef today?"

Ethan nodded. "Yes."

Benjamin looked astonished. "It's really her? When Mom mentioned it yesterday, I thought she was joking."

"She's skilled." Ethan's tone was neutral, but his eyes flicked to an unfamiliar black Audi parked outside.

Grace followed his gaze. "New car. Your grandmother got one too."

Ethan raised a brow. "You went through a lot of trouble to keep it from her."

"I'll go see Jenna in the kitchen." Grace started toward it.

Ethan blocked her path. "She's busy. Don't disturb her."

Grace smiled knowingly. "Fine. Let's head in then."

The three walked toward the banquet hall together. Ethan glanced back one last time at the kitchen, where Jenna's figure was still faintly visible through the glass door.
###Chapter 293

Jenna Roland plated the final dish just as the wall clock struck half past eleven.

She exhaled deeply, massaging her aching lower back.

Tristan Ashcroft handed her a glass of water. "Miss Roland, take a break."

Her fingers trembled slightly as she accepted the glass. She hadn't stopped working all morning, not even for a sip of water.

"Thanks." She drained the glass in one go.

Removing her chef's hat and mask, she said, "Manager Ashcroft, I'll leave the serving to your team."

Stepping out of the kitchen, Jenna finally noticed her disheveled appearance. Her white T-shirt clung to her skin with sweat, damp bangs stuck to her forehead, and the heavy scent of cooking oil permeated her clothes.

She bit her lip. These distinguished guests deserved better than a sweat-drenched chef at Grandma Blanche's birthday banquet.

Her phone vibrated. Grandma Blanche was calling.

"Grandma, all the dishes are ready," she whispered. "Something urgent came up—I need to leave early. Wishing you boundless happiness and eternal youth."

In the banquet hall, Grandma Blanche shot to her feet. "What? You're leaving?"

The entire table turned at her outburst.

Grandpa Harrison Roscente frowned. "Who's leaving? Jenna?"

"After working all morning?" Grace Roscente huffed.

Ignoring them, Grandma Blanche turned to Ethan Roscente. "Bring her back."

Ethan set down his napkin and strode out.

——

Jenna crouched beside her car in the parking lot, waiting for her ride. Footsteps approached from behind.

She turned to see Ethan silhouetted against the sunlight.

"Why are you here?" She scrambled to her feet.

His gaze swept over her damp clothes. "Grandma sent me to retrieve a deserter."

Jenna tugged at her sweat-stained shirt. "I'd ruin everyone's appetite looking like this."

"True. You're rather unappetizing."

Her eyes widened. "Must you be so blunt?"

"But no one cares about that." His tone shifted. "Don't you want to taste your own lobster?"

Jenna froze. She hadn't eaten seafood since her mother passed away.
###Chapter 294

The taste she hadn't experienced in years made her momentarily dazed.

While working at the stove, she had secretly hoped to savor the dishes she prepared with her own hands.

But now, looking at her disheveled appearance, even she couldn't bear it. How could she face everyone like this?

"I do want to, but I'm not presentable enough."

Ethan pulled a cigarette case from his pocket, his slender fingers retrieving one and lighting it.

Smoke curled in the air as he glanced at Jenna. "You didn't care when people called you an escort. Why care about your image now?"

The acrid scent of tobacco hit her, but she barely noticed.

"This is different!"

"How?" Ethan countered.

Jenna bit her lower lip. "Those rumors couldn't hurt me. But this... it's undignified."

"Street scavengers, construction workers—they're all covered in dust." He flicked the ash. "If your conscience is clear, why worry about what others think?"

Jenna froze.

She never expected the usually taciturn Ethan to say something so profound.

Beneath that cold exterior lay a surprisingly warm heart.

"Thank you."

"Ready to go in now?"

"Yes."

Ethan stubbed out his cigarette and led her toward the banquet hall.

The moment they entered, all eyes turned toward them.

Her sweat-damp bangs clung to her forehead, her dress hem stained with grease, carrying the faint aroma of the kitchen with every step.

Some frowned. Others covered their noses. But out of respect for Grandma Blanche, no one dared speak up.

"Silly girl, why leave after working all morning?" Grandma Blanche greeted her with a smile.

Jenna twisted her fingers nervously. "I didn't want to embarrass you..."

"Nonsense!" Grandma Blanche seized her hand. "Let's see who dares look down on my granddaughter-in-law!"

She gestured toward the head table. "Come, meet your parents-in-law."

Only then did Jenna notice the distinguished-looking couple.

After all this time being married, this was her first meeting with Ethan's parents.

"Father. Mother." She gave a slight bow.

Grace Roscente's eyes crinkled with warmth. "Just as Mother described—a true beauty."

Benjamin Roscente laughed heartily. "No amount of dishevelment could hide your lovely features."

Jenna's ears burned pink.

Grandma Blanche lifted her chin triumphantly. "Did I ever pick anything less than the best?"
###Chapter 295

Jenna Roland took out an exquisite gift box from her bag and presented it to Grandma Blanche with both hands.

"Grandma, I specially picked this gift for you. Happy birthday, and may you enjoy health and longevity."

Grandma Blanche's eyes crinkled into happy crescents as she accepted the box, gently patting Jenna's hand.

"Our Jenna is always the most thoughtful."

With many guests present, Grandma Blanche didn't open the gift immediately but carefully set it aside.

She pulled Jenna to sit beside her at the head table.

Waiters began serving dishes one after another, and the aroma soon filled the grand hall.

When the final course arrived, everyone's eyes widened in astonishment.

Each dish was plated with artistic precision, its vibrant colors and presentation rivaling that of Michelin-starred restaurants.

Who would have guessed Ethan Roscente's seemingly ordinary wife possessed such extraordinary culinary skills?

"Today's banquet was entirely prepared by our Jenna. Please, everyone, don't be shy—dig in!" Grandma Blanche announced proudly.

The guests eagerly sampled the dishes, each bite eliciting murmurs of admiration.

"The braised pork melts in your mouth—absolutely divine!"

"The steamed sea bass is cooked to absolute perfection."

Amidst the chorus of compliments, even Grandma Blanche received her share of praise by association.

Beaming with pride, Grandma Blanche couldn't stop smiling—Jenna's performance today had brought her immense face.

Relatives who had previously harbored reservations about Jenna now regarded her with newfound respect.

Just as the atmosphere reached its peak, Sophie Roscente entered arm-in-arm with Vanessa Galatea.

Jenna's smile froze instantly.

Her gaze locked onto Sophie, bewildered by her decision to bring Vanessa.

If Vanessa publicly revealed Jenna's past at the club, the consequences would be catastrophic.

Sophie and Vanessa approached Grandma Blanche to present their gifts.

"Grandma, wishing you happiness and longevity!"

"Grandma Blanche, may you live as long as the pines and cranes!"

Grandma Blanche accepted their gifts cheerfully and gestured for them to be seated.

Sophie nodded at Jenna. "Sis."

Jenna forced a strained smile in return.

Vanessa shot Jenna a meaningful glance before following Sophie to the adjacent table.

For the remainder of the banquet, Jenna sat on pins and needles, her nerves frayed as she kept constant watch on Vanessa.

Only when the celebration concluded and Vanessa departed with Sophie did Jenna finally exhale in relief.

Guests leaving the event couldn't stop praising Jenna's culinary talents.

When only family remained in the hall, Grandma Blanche took Jenna's hands in hers.

"Jenna, today was perfect because of you. Grandma is truly happy."
###Chapter 296 

"Jenna, you've worked so hard," Benjamin Roscente said gently.

Grace Roscente smiled warmly. "I should thank you too. That was the most delicious meal I've ever had."

Jenna nervously twisted the hem of her shirt. "Grandma Blanche, Mom, Dad—I'm part of the Roscente family now. Taking care of Grandma is my duty. Please don't stand on ceremony."

Benjamin suddenly spoke up. "Jenna, you and Ethan should come home more often."

The living room fell silent. Everyone shot Benjamin disapproving looks.

Realizing his slip, he quickly corrected himself. "I mean, now that you two have your own place, your mother and I should visit you sometime."

Jenna nodded obediently. "Of course, Dad."

Grandma Blanche chuckled, smoothing over the awkwardness. "Jenna's cooking is truly exceptional. We should all go together. I feel restless if I don't have her dishes for even one day."

"I was skeptical before, but now I'm a believer," Grace agreed.

Benjamin gazed at Jenna with fatherly affection. "Having a daughter-in-law like you is a blessing for our family. May you both live happily. It would be even better if you could give us a grandchild soon."

Jenna's cheeks flushed. They'd only been married for a month—why were they already talking about babies?

Grandma Blanche noticed her discomfort and intervened. "Let the young couple decide that for themselves. No pressure."

"It's getting late. We should go," Grace said, rising to leave. "Jenna, Ethan, we'll see ourselves out."

"Drive safely, Mom," Jenna waved with a smile.

After seeing her in-laws off, Grandma Blanche asked Ethan to drive Jenna back to the city.

Ethan walked to the parking lot without a word. Leaning against the car door, he took a drag of his cigarette before stubbing it out when Jenna approached.

As the car merged onto the highway, Ethan broke the silence. "Did you contact your uncle?"

"I was too busy this morning," Jenna admitted.

"Do it now." His tone brooked no argument as he kept his eyes on the road.

Jenna pulled out her phone and dialed Victor Roland. "Did you sell me to that fat creep? Victor, that's illegal!"

"What nonsense! I have no idea what you're talking about!" Victor's voice dripped with indignation, as if deeply wronged.

Jenna gritted her teeth. "Then why did I wake up in a hotel? You drugged me at dinner and delivered me to someone's bed, didn't you? Where's your conscience, Victor? What happened to returning my orchard? Where's the transfer contract? The keys? Did you steal those too?"
###Chapter 297

"Jenna, have you lost your mind?" Victor Roland's furious voice crackled through the phone. "I handed you the contract and keys myself. You lost them, and now you're blaming me?"

Jenna's grip on the phone turned her knuckles white.

"Stop playing dumb!" Her voice trembled. "I know exactly what you did while I was unconscious. Victor, aren't you afraid of karma?"

"You insolent brat!" he roared. "I'm your uncle! How dare you speak to me like this?"

"Uncle?" Jenna let out a bitter laugh. "After what you've done, you don't deserve that title. Heaven sees everything. You'll pay for this."

She slammed the phone down, her chest heaving.

"What did he say?" Ethan Roscente kept his eyes on the road, hands steady on the wheel.

"Denied everything." Jenna clenched her jaw. "I never want to see them again. Or else..."

Her nails dug into her palms.

Ethan glanced at her. "You're just going to let it go?"

"What else can I do?" She rubbed her temples wearily. "That man has powerful connections. I don't want to drag you into this."

She turned to watch the blur of passing scenery, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Thank you for saving me..."

Ethan simply gave a quiet "Hmm" in response.

As they entered the city, he finally spoke. "Where to?"

"Home." Jenna closed her eyes. "I'm exhausted."

The sunlight stung her eyes, intensifying her dizziness.

When the car stopped at Beverly Hills, Jenna's steps were unsteady as she got out. Ethan waited until she disappeared into the complex before driving toward his company.

The black sedan pulled up in front of HM Group's towering headquarters.

The receptionist hurried forward as soon as Ethan entered the lobby. "Mr. Roscente, Deputy Mayor Ho is waiting in your office."

Without breaking stride, he headed straight for the private elevator.

Inside the office, Deputy Mayor Ho Hongtian sat perfectly postured on the sofa. His crisp white shirt and immaculate tie matched the professional smile on his face. A female secretary stood behind him.

At the sound of the door opening, Ho rose to his feet.
###Chapter 298

Ethan Roscente stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his fingers nervously tracing the cuff of his suit. At the sound of approaching footsteps, he whirled around, a sycophantic smile plastered across his face.

"Mr. Roscente, forgive the intrusion." He hurried forward, bowing so low his spine creaked. "The receptionist said you were in a meeting, so I took the liberty—"

Ethan strode past him without acknowledgment, the black trench coat billowing like a storm cloud. He loosened his tie and sank into the leather sofa, long fingers drumming the armrest.

"Three minutes."

Sweat beaded on the man's forehead. He fumbled for a handkerchief. "It's about my worthless younger brother—"

"Name." Ethan's voice was a poisoned arrow.

"Henry Wen." The man's Adam's apple bobbed. "Last week... with Miss Jenna..."

The crystal tumbler shattered in Ethan's grip. Blood and burgundy dripped onto the Persian rug, but he didn't flinch.

"So it was him." A humorless smile touched Ethan's lips, his eyes glacial. "How do you plan to bury the body?"

The man's knees buckled. "Mr. Roscente, I swear! That bastard didn't know Miss Roland was under your protection!" His voice cracked. "Punish him however you see fit—"

Ethan lit a cigar, smoke curling around his razor-sharp jawline. "Compensation?" He exhaled a perfect ring. "What's your brother's life worth?"

"F-five—no, eighty million!" The man corrected hastily. "Henry owns a waterfront villa in Malibu—"

"Quite the philanthropist, Deputy Mayor." Ethan leaned forward suddenly, the cigar's ember grazing the man's nose. "The disciplinary committee would love to hear about this."

The color drained from the man's face. "It's clean money! My mother's inheritance—"

Ethan stubbed out the cigar in a crystal ashtray. "Have that trash crawl on his knees to apologize." He adjusted his cufflinks. "One missing kowtow, one less finger."

"Yes, yes! I'll drag him there myself—"

"Wait." Ethan stood silhouetted against the window, one hand in his pocket. "Who put him up to it?"

The man froze. His mouth opened and closed before he slumped in defeat. "I truly don't know..."

The temperature in the office plummeted. Ethan pressed the intercom. "Escort him out."

When the mahogany door thudded shut, he yanked his tie loose. Fury churned in his darkened gaze. On the security monitor, the man stumbled into the elevator like a broken marionette.
###Chapter 299

Ethan Roscente burst into the hospital room and grabbed Victor Roland by the collar.

"Talk! Who connected you with Jenna Roland?"

Victor froze at the sudden accusation, then turned his face away.

"Brother, you know the code of the streets. I've always valued loyalty."

The veins on Ethan's hand bulged as he resisted the urge to strike.

"You know my methods. If you don't talk, you're dead."

Victor scoffed, wincing as his split lip stretched.

"I'm dead either way. Why should I betray anyone?"

"Besides naming your accomplice," Ethan hissed through clenched teeth, "you'll kneel and apologize to Jenna. Call her 'Madam'!"

"What?!"

Victor jerked upright in bed, his injuries screaming in protest.

"You want me to kneel to that bitch? Have you lost your mind?"

He'd paid good money, only to get beaten within an inch of his life without even touching her.

"Who told you to buy her?" Ethan's retort silenced him.

Victor's face darkened as he remembered the sycophantic smiles of Victor and Fiona Roland.

"It was Victor!" he spat. "Jenna's own uncle!"

Ethan snorted coldly. "Apologize the moment you're discharged. Or I'll disown you."

The door slammed shut.

Victor grabbed his phone, dialing with murderous intent.

......

Jenna startled awake to her ringing phone.

"We've got them." Ethan's deep voice came through. "Victor and Fiona orchestrated it."

Sleep vanished instantly.

"I knew it!"

"The evidence is irrefutable."

She clutched the sheets. "Is this a crime?"

"Ask your lawyer." The line went dead.

Jenna immediately called Hugo Valence.

"Hugo, I need legal advice."

After hearing her account, Hugo paused. "Did Victor succeed?"
###Chapter 300

Jenna Roland shook her head. "No."

"Under these circumstances, legal action would be difficult," Hugo Valence's steady voice came through the phone. "Your uncle and his son are suspected of human trafficking, but we need concrete proof. Eyewitnesses or physical evidence would be ideal."

"Eyewitnesses? Evidence?" Jenna let out a bitter laugh. "Where am I supposed to find that?"

"Eyewitnesses mean people who saw it happen. Physical evidence includes bank transfer records, chat screenshots, anything like that. If it was a cash transaction, it'll be even harder to prove."

Jenna tightened her grip on the phone. If only she'd recorded them.

"So there's nothing I can do?"

"Without evidence, the police won't open a case. And they might even accuse you of false charges."

Jenna understood the risks. False accusations, defamation—she knew these tactics all too well.

"I see. Thank you, Mr. Valence."

She hung up and collapsed onto her bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.

This was clearly a carefully planned scheme. Drugging her, arranging the deal—every step had been calculated. Fiona and Jason Roland had done this before. They'd be extra careful now.

Without proof, she was powerless.

But at least she could stay away from them.

Jenna sighed heavily. She'd planned to settle down once she got the orchard back. Now it seemed she'd have to keep running her street stall.

Three days later, at dawn, Jenna was stopped by two burly men in black as she rode her e-bike out of Beverly Hills.

She frowned and tried to go around them, but they blocked her path again.

"What do you want?" Jenna gripped the handlebars warily.

A black sedan pulled up slowly. The door opened, revealing a figure she despised—Byron Valdemar.

"Get lost!" Jenna snapped.

To her surprise, Byron dropped his usual arrogance. "Miss Roland, I didn't know about your connection to Mr. Roscente. What happened at the hotel was my fault. I apologize!"

"Apologize?" Jenna scoffed. "You think an apology can undo what you did?"

Suddenly, Byron dropped to his knees. "Please, I was wrong! Forgive me!"

The unexpected gesture stunned her.

Passersby turned to stare, whispering among themselves.

Jenna snapped out of it. "Get out of here. Don't let me see you again!"

"Yes, yes!" Byron scrambled up like he'd been granted mercy and hurried away with his bodyguards.

The moment he got into the car, his phone rang. After listening, his face paled. "Port Hudson! Now!" he barked at the driver.
###Chapter 301

A chilling wind swept through Port Hudson. Victor Roland and his family lay bound with coarse ropes on the damp concrete, discarded like cargo.

Four hulking men in black loomed over them, their gun barrels glinting coldly under the moonlight.

"Please spare us!" Jason Roland was the first to break, his face slick with snot and tears. The bully who once tormented Jenna now trembled like a leaf.

Fiona Roland forced composure, though her voice quivered. "Name your price, gentlemen. Just don't shoot!"

The scar-faced leader pressed his gun beneath her chin. "Oh? How much can you offer?"

"Fifty thousand! No—a hundred thousand!" Fiona blurted. "My husband's orchard had a good harvest this year—"

"Bullshit!" Victor roared suddenly. "We don't have that kind of money! This is extortion!"

The scarred man smirked, shifting his aim to Victor's temple. "Some people won't yield until they see their coffin."

"Dad!" Jason shrieked. "Just agree to their terms!"

Fiona kicked her husband desperately. "Victor, you miser! Is money worth more than our lives?"

Beads of sweat formed on Victor's forehead. Years of withholding Jenna's wages and exploiting orchard workers had indeed padded his savings. But handing it over felt like carving out his flesh.

"One point five million for three lives," the leader drawled. "One cent less, and you'll feed the fishes."

Another thug added, "This dock's cleared out tonight. Not even a fly could get through."

Jason completely unraveled, wailing, "Dad! The Roland bloodline ends with me!"

Fiona suddenly hissed, "Victor, survival first. We'll deal with that wretched Jenna later!"

Victor's pupils constricted. Was Jenna behind this?

"Counting to three." The leader cocked his weapon. "One—"

"Fine! Take it!" Victor finally relented, though his heart bled. This money was meant for orchard expansion.

As Fiona exhaled in relief, the scarred man uttered chillingly, "Too late."

The gun's dark muzzle pressed against Victor's forehead.
###Chapter 302

Victor Roland glared at Fiona Roland with burning fury. "I told you to live quietly! Instead, you extorted Jenna and her brother, then sold Jenna off! Now you're facing the consequences!"

Fiona froze, shocked that her husband was pinning all the blame on her.

She sneered. "You were part of selling Jenna too! Didn't you spend that money? The new phone, designer suits, that hundred-thousand-dollar watch—all bought by you! Now you want to wash your hands clean? Victor, you're disgusting!"

Victor stayed silent, determined not to pay a cent of the 1.5 million.

As Fiona began shouting and Jason Roland joined in, a black Audi pulled up silently behind them.

Several men in black suits approached.

When they heard that familiar voice, the family of three turned pale.

It was the real estate tycoon who had bought Jenna!

Why was he here?

Had the deal fallen through? Was he here for revenge?

Terrified, they exchanged panicked glances.

Byron Valdemar stood before them, hands in his pockets, his gaze dark and venomous.

The humiliation of nearly being crippled by Ethan Roscente at the hotel fueled his rage.

"Beat them to death!" he barked, slashing his hand through the air.

Fiona nearly fainted from fear. "Mr. Valdemar, what did we do wrong? We'll return the money, please don't hurt us!"

She and Victor were too old to survive a brutal beating.

Byron gritted his teeth. "Why didn't you tell me Jenna knew Ethan Roscente? You ruined me! Do it!"

Three bodyguards immediately dragged them apart, raining down punches and kicks.

Bound and helpless, they could only take the beating like human punching bags.

Jason, young and sturdy, endured it better. But Fiona and Victor weren't so lucky.

Within ten minutes, both had multiple fractures, faces swollen with bruises, blood trickling from their mouths.

Any longer, and they might not survive.

Listening to their agonized screams, Byron finally felt some satisfaction.

He raised a hand, and the bodyguards immediately stopped, stepping back.
###Chapter 303

Winston Ho glared down at Fiona Roland, his eyes glinting with cold fury.

"Every cent must be returned." He ground his heel into the back of her hand. "Or today will be your last day alive."

Fiona gasped in pain, turning her head with difficulty to look at Victor Roland lying in a pool of blood.

"Husband..." Her voice was barely a whisper. "Give... him... the money..."

A million dollars was a small price to pay for their lives.

She'd remember this. Once she recovered, that bitch Jenna would pay tenfold.

Victor spat out a mouthful of blood, his eyes flashing with malice.

The orchard could never fall into Jenna's hands.

"I... agree..." he forced out through gritted teeth.

Winston smiled in satisfaction and removed his foot, brushing off his suit sleeve.

"Two weeks." He held up one finger. "One cent missing, and you'll be picking out coffins."

Victor nodded weakly from the floor like a beaten dog.

Winston strode out with his men.

Thirty minutes later, Heidi Roland rushed into the warehouse in her stilettos.

"Jason!" She threw herself at her husband. "Who did this?"

Jason gave a bloody grin and recounted what happened.

"You're actually going to pay?" Heidi's voice shot up an octave.

Jason gave a bitter laugh. "What choice do we have?"

Heidi turned pale, fumbling for her phone.

"How did you find us?" Jason suddenly asked.

"Location tracking." She didn't look up. "I installed a tracker on your phone."

Jason: "..."

Sirens wailed as the ambulance arrived.

Paramedics worked frantically over the three bloodied figures before loading them onto stretchers.

......

The next afternoon, sunlight streamed through the hospital windows.

Jenna stepped into the elevator carrying a fruit basket, texting Stella for confirmation.

[Is Lucien there?]

Getting a negative reply, she relaxed.

When she pushed open the hospital room door, Stella was chewing on a dry piece of bread.

"That's all you're eating?" Jenna frowned. "Where's your sister?"

Stella swallowed the crumbs. "She's busy with her startup. Didn't come today."

She reached for the milk carton on the bedside table.

Jenna handed it to her first.

"Thanks." Stella took a gulp, then lowered her voice. "I heard your uncle was in ICU last night?"
###Chapter 304

Jenna Roland sat on the chair beside the hospital bed, her brow slightly furrowed. "What have you been eating these past few days? Didn't your sister cook for you?"

Stella Laurent pouted, absentmindedly twisting the corner of the bedsheet. "She just orders takeout for me."

Jenna's breath hitched.

She never expected Sylvia to care for her sister in the hospital without even preparing a proper meal.

"I'll make you chicken soup tomorrow," Jenna said firmly. "You need proper nutrition."

Stella's eyes lit up before she quickly waved her hands. "That's too much trouble. Takeout is fine—no dishes to wash."

"Don't be polite with me." Jenna stood, placing her bag on the chair. "I'm going to the restroom. Eat your meal first."

As she stepped out of the ward, Jenna walked down the hallway toward the bathroom.

Passing another room, she suddenly froze.

The voices inside were unmistakable.

Heidi Roland's loud, distinctive tone was clearly audible even through the door.

Hesitating for a moment, Jenna quietly approached. The door was slightly ajar, making the conversation even clearer.

It wasn't just Heidi.

Victor Roland and Fiona Roland were there too.

Jenna narrowed her eyes and pushed the door open.

Inside, three hospital beds held Victor, Fiona, and Jason Roland.

"Well, well," Jenna leaned against the doorframe, a mocking smile curling her lips. "Karma finally caught up with you?"

Victor's legs were both in casts, suspended in the air. Fiona looked even worse—her head wrapped in bandages, face bruised purple and blue.

Victor started to lash out but suddenly clutched his chest, his face turning pale.

"Get out!" he hissed through gritted teeth.

Unfazed, Jenna pulled out her phone and started recording. "Such a priceless moment deserves to be preserved."

Fiona, unable to move, could only glare venomously. "You little bitch! Just you wait!"

"Wait for you to be discharged?" Jenna pocketed her phone, her smile sweet. "I'd prefer you stay here forever. Better yet—drop dead so Milo and I can attend your funeral."

She tilted her head, feigning regret. "What a shame. The wicked always live long."
###Chapter 305

Jenna Roland's sharp tongue left Victor Roland and his family trembling with rage, their faces turning ashen.

Confined to their hospital beds, they could only glare at her with venomous eyes.

Jenna stood before them, a mocking smile playing on her lips.

"Scum like you don't deserve to breathe," she said coolly. "Karma will come for you soon."

Fiona Roland slammed her hand against the bedrail. "You bitch! Get out!"

Victor's face flushed crimson, his blood pressure spiking. "Jenna Roland, I hope you rot in hell!"

Jason Roland gnashed his teeth, hatred burning in his eyes.

Jenna gave them one last dismissive glance. "May you all get there first."

She turned and walked away, their hysterical curses echoing behind her.

Outside the ward, Jenna exhaled deeply, her mood light as she returned to Stella Laurent's room.

Stella looked up from her phone and grinned.

"Feel better?" she teased.

Jenna nodded. "Much."

Just then, Sylvia Savigny entered, carrying a fruit basket.

"Oh, Jenna's here too." Sylvia set the basket on the nightstand.

Jenna stood to offer her seat. "Just visiting Stella."

Sylvia sat down, her expression conflicted. "Has Lucien Valois contacted you?"

"No." Jenna shook her head. "I've already resigned."

Stella chimed in, "He'll probably look for you at the club. Good thing he doesn't know where you live."

Jenna felt a surge of relief. The last thing she wanted was Lucien discovering her shared home with Ethan Roscente.

"What about you?" Jenna turned to Sylvia. "Any plans?"

Sylvia gave a bitter laugh. "He dumped me. Exactly what I wanted."

"Why do you say that?" Jenna asked curiously.

"He's dangerous," Sylvia lowered her voice. "And his wife is worse. I've been trying to escape for a while."

Jenna nodded in agreement. "Staying away is the right choice. We can build good lives on our own."

A determined glint flashed in Sylvia's eyes. "I'm opening a small shop. Starting fresh."

Sunlight streamed through the window, bathing the three young women in its glow—as if heralding new beginnings.
###Chapter 306

Sylvia Savigny counted the digits on her bank statement, a faint smile curling her lips.

"This savings should be enough to start a small business. I can support myself."

"Every woman should be independent like this," Jenna Roland agreed with a nod.

The sudden ringtone shattered the quiet.

Sylvia's fingers froze when she saw the caller ID. "It's Lucien Valois." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "It must be about you."

"Answer it," Jenna said calmly.

Taking a deep breath, Sylvia pressed accept. "Lucien, what is it?"

"Is your sister still in the hospital?" His voice carried through the receiver.

"Yes." Sylvia glanced at Stella Laurent lying on the hospital bed and chose honesty. She knew too well how futile lies were against Lucien.

Two seconds of silence. Then the line went dead.

Sylvia turned urgently to Jenna. "He's personally involved now. You need to leave."

Jenna nodded, quickly bidding Stella goodbye before exiting.

Once the door closed, Stella couldn't hold back. "Lucien has money and power. Why obsess over a married woman? He already has a wife. Why didn't he just marry who he wanted?"

"It was a business marriage." Sylvia leaned back in her chair. "He admitted marrying that woman was out of necessity."

Before she could finish, the door swung open.

Lucien stood there in a black shirt, flanked by two bodyguards. He'd arrived impossibly fast—as if he'd been waiting nearby.

Sylvia was relieved Jenna had left in time.

"Lucien." She stood to greet him.

He strode past her directly to the bed. "I heard you've been close with Jenna Roland?" No pleasantries.

Stella met his gaze. "We're good friends."

"Then you know where she lives?" His smile didn't reach his chilling eyes.

"She moved to her husband's place after marriage. I don't know the exact address." Stella's expression didn't flicker.

Lucien's eyes narrowed. The air turned glacial.

"Really don't know?"
###Chapter 307

Stella gave a slight nod, her gaze steady as she met his eyes. "She invited me to her place once, but I was with Jake Varley at the time, so it didn't work out."

Lucien's dark eyes remained fixed on her, his sharp gaze piercing as if trying to see through her facade.

Stella's expression was unreadable, giving away nothing.

"Lucien, you got here so quickly," she murmured.

His tone was indifferent. "I happened to be nearby on business. Thought I'd stop by and ask."

"I'm really sorry. I don't know Jenna's current address, or I would've told you." Stella pressed her lips together, regret flashing across her face.

The corner of Lucien's mouth lifted slightly. "It's fine. Get some rest. I'll take my leave."

"Take care," Stella said politely.

From start to finish, Lucien never once glanced at Sylvia.

They had spent four years together, day in and day out. Had all that time meant nothing to him?

Just because she helped Jenna once, was she now his sworn enemy?

Four years of companionship couldn't compare to someone he'd only met twice.

This man truly had no heart.

Sylvia had initially felt sad about the breakup. After all, four years was a long time—even a pet would've grown on her.

But seeing Lucien's attitude today made everything painfully clear.

She had been the only one who ever cared.

The last remnants of lingering affection vanished in that moment.

"Your face looks pale," Stella said, noticing Sylvia's dimmed expression.

Sylvia casually peeled a banana. "I'm fine. Want some?"

"No, thanks."

Stella sighed, seeing right through her sister's act. "Did you fall for Lucien?"

Sylvia laughed lightly. "Don't be ridiculous. How could I?"

"Lucien has looks, status—everything. You spent four years with him. Who would believe you didn't develop feelings?"

"This time, I'm not lying," Sylvia insisted firmly. "I don't like him."

Stella grew serious. "Anyone but him. It's good that you're apart now. Don't see him again."

Lucien hadn't even spared her a glance. Why would she humiliate herself further?

They were from different worlds to begin with. Maybe this separation was fate.

......

A week later, Milo's summer break finally began.

Jenna let him rest at home for two days while she deep-cleaned the apartment. On the third morning, she took him to the hospital.

She had carefully chosen this facility, renowned for its expertise in treating congenital heart disease.

To ensure accurate test results, Jenna made sure Milo went without breakfast.

Registration, paperwork, waiting—by the time they finished the series of examinations, most of the day had passed.

Heart surgery carried immense risks. Milo's condition had to be flawless before they could proceed.
###Chapter 308

The test results came in at 3:30 PM.

Jenna Roland clutched the thick stack of reports as she hurried toward the specialist's office.

The doctor reviewed all the data carefully before typing up a hospital admission notice. "The surgery schedule is full. The earliest opening is the morning after tomorrow."

Jenna nodded in agreement. After completing the admission paperwork, she escorted Milo Roland to his hospital room.

As soon as her brother was settled, she dialed Ethan Roscente's number.

"All the tests are done. The surgery is scheduled for the day after tomorrow." Her fingers tightened around the phone. "Can you reach Dr. Melford?"

The sound of rustling papers came through the line. "Consider it done. I'll have him there tomorrow."

"Thank you so much."

"My pleasure."

Ethan noted the hospital address before ending the call. Instead of contacting Liam Melford immediately, he pressed the intercom button.

When his assistant Lucas entered, he found his CEO standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, long fingers tapping lightly against the frame.

"Find me the contact information for the president of Johns Hopkins Hospital." Ethan turned, his sharp gaze as cool as ever.

"Right away."

Lucas worked with astonishing efficiency, returning with the details in under ten minutes. "The president is Matthew Macmillan. His number is—"

Ethan dialed directly.

"President Macmillan, a pleasure."

A hesitant elderly voice answered, "May I ask who's calling?"

"Ethan Roscente of HM Group."

Matthew's sharp intake of breath was audible, followed by the screech of his chair. "Mr. Roscente? To what do I owe—"

"A friend is undergoing heart surgery at your facility." Ethan cut straight to the point. "I need a favor."

"The patient's name?"

"Milo Roland, cardiac surgery." Ethan's tone was casual, as if discussing the weather. "I've arranged for Liam Melford to perform the operation. Any objections?"

"Liam Melford?!" Matthew's glasses slid down his nose. "Professor Melford from Mayo Clinic?"

His voice cracked with excitement. The legendary surgeon commanded astronomical consultation fees most hospitals couldn't afford.

"He'll arrive tomorrow." Ethan confirmed tersely.

Matthew's mind raced with calculations of the prestige this surgery would bring. Rubbing his hands together, he eagerly agreed, "No problem at all! Absolutely no problem!"
###Chapter 309

The soft hospital lights fell on Jenna Roland.

She sat on a blue plastic chair, her fingers just brushing an apple in the fruit basket when her phone vibrated in her purse.

Jenna set the apple down and pulled out her phone.

"Dr. Melford will arrive in Los Angeles tomorrow afternoon," Ethan Roscente's voice came through the receiver. "The consultation is scheduled for evening, surgery the day after."

"Really?" Jenna's voice trembled.

"Yes."

"Thank you so much!" She gripped the phone tighter. "Once Milo's discharged, I'll properly thank you."

She mentally planned to cook all her signature dishes.

"We'll see." Ethan's tone remained flat.

"I'll be caring for Milo these days, so I might not cook on time."

"Understood."

After hanging up, Jenna grabbed Milo's hand.

"Dr. Melford himself will operate on you!" Her eyes sparkled. "Happy?"

Milo had already researched Liam Melford's credentials.

Top cardiac surgeon at Mayo Clinic.

A 99% success rate legend.

"Sis, I'll definitely recover." Milo grinned. "I'll get into Harvard, make big money to take care of you."

Jenna patted his hand.

"Just stay healthy." Her voice softened. "That's all I want."

"Mom and Dad will watch over us."

Jenna picked up a fruit knife.

Apple peel spiraled down in ribbons.

"Here."

Milo took a huge bite.

"So sweet!"

"I'll peel another if you like."

Jenna rose with a smile to wash her hands.

The hallway lights glared.

Shaking water droplets from her fingers, she looked up and collided with Lucien Valois.

A fashionable woman clung to his arm.

Her makeup flawless, she whispered intimately against Lucien's shoulder with a tinkling laugh.
###Chapter 310

Jenna's fingertips trembled slightly.

She recognized the tall figure at the end of the hallway instantly.

Lucien Valois.

Memories of that night at the club came flooding back.

She instinctively ducked into the nearest hospital room.

The lock clicked softly behind her.

Jenna leaned against the cold door, her heart pounding like a drum.

Damn it.

This hospital had dozens of departments and thousands of rooms.

Why did she have to run into him?

Had he seen her?

"Young lady."

A kind voice startled her.

Jenna turned to see a silver-haired grandmother sitting on the bed.

The old woman's eyes crinkled into crescents. "Could you open the door? My family's here."

"Of course."

Jenna took a deep breath.

She turned the doorknob.

Her blood ran cold.

Lucien stood right outside.

A stunning woman clung to his arm.

"Who are you?"

The woman frowned slightly.

Jenna's mind raced.

"Sorry, wrong room."

She kept her head down and rushed past them.

Her shoulder brushed against Lucien's suit jacket.

The faint scent of cedarwood filled her nostrils.

"I need to take this call."

Lucien's voice followed her.

Jenna practically dove into the next room.

"Sis? What's wrong?"

Her brother Milo looked up in confusion.

Jenna stared through the door's glass panel.

Lucien appeared in the hallway.

He held a phone to his ear.

But his gaze locked onto the hospital room.

Cold sweat trickled down Jenna's back.

Was this man insane?

His wife was right next door.

Yet he had the audacity to follow her?

After a tense moment,

Lucien finally turned away.

Jenna exhaled shakily.

Her legs gave out.

She collapsed onto the edge of the bed.
###Chapter 311

Jenna Roland requested a room transfer first thing in the morning. She wanted to cut all ties with Lucien Valois.

The general wards were fully occupied. Only two VIP rooms remained available.

With no other choice, Jenna moved to the VIP ward. To avoid Lucien's harassment, she specifically instructed the doctor not to disclose her whereabouts.

The doctor readily agreed. He immediately called a staff meeting, emphasizing the need for confidentiality regarding Milo Roland's transfer.

The night before, Director Matthew Macmillan had personally visited the department. The CEO of HM Group had called, requesting special care for Milo.

With the director's orders, the doctor took extra precautions. He repeatedly reminded the nurses to keep their lips sealed.

A single word from someone powerful could indeed eliminate troubles and secure privileges.

The nurses nodded in agreement before returning to their stations.

......

Shortly after Milo was transferred upstairs, Lucien Valois came looking for Jenna.

He wasn't there to visit his grandmother. His sole purpose was to track Jenna down.

When he arrived at her former room, he found another patient occupying it.

Lucien's face darkened instantly.

He marched to the nurses' station and demanded coldly, "Where's the patient from Bed 59?"

The nurse on duty looked up blankly. "I don't know."

A flash of anger crossed his eyes. "You work here. How can you not know a patient's whereabouts?"

The nurse shrugged helplessly. "Tracking patients isn't part of my job description."

He questioned several other nurses, but all gave the same vague answers. Some speculated she had been discharged, while others guessed she transferred hospitals.

Lucien refused to believe Jenna would leave. Just yesterday, he'd noticed the absence of IV equipment in her room.

Frustrated, he barged into the doctor's office.

Only Simon Macmillan, Milo's attending physician, was present.

Dr. Simon was the one who'd instructed the nurses to stay silent. Facing Lucien's interrogation, he answered calmly, "The patient has been discharged."

Without Jenna's contact information, Lucien couldn't verify the claim immediately.

He narrowed his eyes dangerously. "Do you know who I am?"

Dr. Simon shook his head. "No."

Lucien smirked. "My father is Mayor Vincent Valois. If I find out you're lying, you'll never work in Los Angeles again."

Dr. Simon's heart skipped a beat. He hadn't expected such influential connections.

Then again, plenty of people falsely claimed powerful backgrounds these days. How could he be sure this wasn't a bluff?
###Chapter 312

A glint of amusement flashed in Simon Macmillan's eyes as he tapped twice on the medical chart with his fingertips.

"Hospital policy protects patient privacy." He adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "Contact the patient directly for visitation."

Lucien Valois's knuckles turned white.

In the past, this doctor would've been begging for mercy on the floor by now.

He snorted coldly and slammed the door on his way out.

In the hallway, Lucien stopped a nurse pushing a medication cart.

"Where's the patient in Bed 59?"

Ethan Roscente stood at the corner, his hand tightening abruptly inside his chef's coat pocket.

The name "Lucien Valois" cut through his eardrums like a blade.

That playboy from the Valois family.

Didn't he learn his lesson from the club incident last time?

Ethan pulled out his phone, eyes glacial.

Inside the VIP ward, Jenna Roland was peeling an apple for her brother.

"Dr. Roscente!" Milo Roland scrambled to sit up but was gently pressed back down by Ethan's hand on his shoulder.

"Stay put."

His gaze swept over the takeout containers on the bedside table.

"Appetite's improved?"

Jenna slapped the fruit knife onto the table.

"There's someone looking for you downstairs." Ethan undid his cufflink. "A Mr. Valois."

Jenna's pupils constricted sharply.

"That persistent cockroach."

She grabbed a tissue and scrubbed her hands viciously.

Ethan leaned against the windowsill, sunlight gilding his profile.

"Mr. Valois has decent qualifications." His tone was deliberately casual. "Good family. Good looks."

Jenna let out a cold laugh.

"Picking men from the trash heap now?"

She hurled the apple core into the wastebasket.

"Married with a wife at home while chasing skirts outside." Her chest heaved violently. "I wouldn't take that filth even if you paid me!"

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted almost imperceptibly.

His vibrating phone chimed.

The name "Vincent Valois" flashed brightly across the screen.
###Chapter 313

Jenna's scathing words about Lucien Valois exploded like firecrackers in Ethan's chest, sending sparks of joy through him.

He pressed his lips tightly together, fighting to conceal his amusement.

"So you're not interested in him?" Ethan deliberately probed with feigned indifference.

Jenna rolled her eyes in exasperation. "Mr. Roscente, we're legally married. Is that really appropriate to ask?"

She planted her hands on her hips, bristling like an angry kitten.

A glint of satisfaction flashed in Ethan's eyes. "Good to know you understand boundaries."

"Of course I do!" Jenna declared firmly. "I won't develop feelings for anyone else before our divorce, rest assured!"

Ethan's heart soared, though his expression remained impassive. "He doesn't seem like the type to give up easily."

"I don't care what he does!" Jenna waved dismissively. "Yesterday was pure bad luck—like walking under a ladder and breaking a mirror combined!"

Ethan finally released the breath he'd been holding.

Milo suddenly interjected, "Mr. Roscente, will Dr. Melford really come today?"

"Yes." Ethan turned to the boy. "He'll finalize the surgical plan after tonight's consultation."

"With Dr. Melford operating, everything will go smoothly." Milo's eyes sparkled with hope.

Ethan met Jenna's gaze. "You can come to me directly if anything arises."

"You've already helped tremendously." Jenna shook her head. "I couldn't possibly trouble you further."

Without Ethan's intervention, Liam Melford would never have taken Milo's case—let alone reduced the fees.

Ethan checked his watch. "I should get going."

Jenna escorted him to the elevator, only returning to the hospital room after the doors closed.

At five that afternoon, Jenna carried a food container back to the room.

Just as she finished clearing the meal, the door swung open.

A man in a crisp white shirt entered, gold-rimmed glasses perched on his aristocratic nose, exuding an air of quiet authority.

Dr. Macmillan followed behind. "This is Dr. Liam Melford, your surgeon tomorrow."

Milo sat up eagerly. "Hello, Dr. Melford."

Liam's phoenix eyes narrowed slightly. "Nervous about tomorrow's procedure?"

"Not when I know you're the one operating." Milo gave a shy smile.

Liam turned to Jenna. "And you are?"

"I'm his sister, Jenna Roland." She quickly introduced herself.

Liam studied her with sudden interest.

So this was the woman who'd made Ethan Roscente break his own rules?
###Chapter 314

Liam Melford adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, surprise flickering in his eyes. He hadn't expected Ethan Roscente to call him personally—let alone for the sake of an ordinary girl's younger brother.

If the head of HM Group was making this request, Jenna Roland must be someone special.

"Milo, get some rest tonight." Liam pushed aside his thoughts and addressed the boy in the hospital bed. "See you tomorrow."

"Okay, Dr. Melford." Milo nodded obediently.

As Liam turned to leave, he caught Jenna sitting by the bed, her eyes brimming with joy.

"Dr. Melford is a world-renowned specialist. The surgery will definitely succeed!" Jenna squeezed her brother's hand. "After you're discharged, let's visit Mom and Dad. They must be watching over you."

Milo chuckled. "Seriously? You still believe in that?"

"It's called faith." Jenna waved him off, bending to pull a basin from under the bed. "I'll get you some warm water."

The moment the water touched his feet, Milo sighed in contentment. Watching his sister's focused profile, he suddenly spoke up. "When I make it big, I'll give you the life you deserve."

"Empty promises again?" Jenna didn't even look up.

"This time I mean it!" Milo sat up straighter.

Jenna set her phone aside and met his gaze. "All I want is for you to be safe and healthy."

She didn't care about wealth. This brother, who'd been her only family since childhood, was all that mattered.

"Just wait and see!" Milo grumbled stubbornly.

By the time Jenna finished soaking her feet, Milo had already refilled the basin and placed it before her.

"Your turn."

Jenna dipped her feet in, warmth spreading from her soles to her heart. Watching her brother's busy figure, her eyes grew moist.

The most precious things in life were never riches or glory.
###Chapter 315

At seven in the morning, Jenna Roland arrived at the hospital.

The corridor outside the operating room was empty. Only the sound of nurses pushing carts echoed through the hall. Milo Roland had already been wheeled into the pre-op area, where Dr. Liam Melford was conducting final checks.

Jenna clutched her phone, her knuckles turning white.

"Don't worry."

Stella Laurent's voice came from behind. She carried two cups of hot coffee and handed one to Jenna.

"Dr. Melford is a leading cardiac surgeon. He's performed this procedure over a hundred times."

Jenna accepted the coffee. The warmth seeped through the paper cup into her palms.

"I know. But it's still a heart transplant..."

Her words were cut off as the operating room light turned red. Nurses wheeled Milo past them on a gurney. He flashed his sister a victory sign.

Stella pulled Jenna down onto a bench.

"How long will it take?"

"At least eight hours." Jenna stared at the closed doors. "Dr. Melford said it's the most complex type of cardiac surgery."

Stella patted her hand.

"Guess who I ran into the other day?"

Jenna abruptly changed the subject. Stella raised an eyebrow.

"Lucien Valois."

Stella nearly spilled her coffee.

"At this hospital? Did he see you?"

"I dodged him." Jenna gave a bitter smile. "Only to accidentally walk into his grandmother's room."

"My God!" Stella gasped. "Was his wife there too?"

Jenna nodded.

"Luckily I reacted fast. His wife seemed gentle enough."

Stella's expression turned serious.

"Don't be fooled by appearances. Her father is the second-in-command at Valois Group. Ruthless tactics run in that family."

Jenna's phone vibrated. The screen displayed "Ethan Roscente."

"Speak of the devil."

She walked to the corridor corner and answered.

"Hello?"

Ethan's deep voice came through. "I'm downstairs at the hospital."
###Chapter 316

"Has your brother gone into surgery yet?"

"Yes, they just wheeled him in. The doctor said it'll take seven or eight hours. I'm sorry I can't make lunch for you today."

......

Top-floor executive office at HM Group.

Ethan Roscente pulled a cigarette case from his drawer. His slender fingers extracted a single cigarette. The lighter clicked, flames illuminating his chiseled profile.

"Focus on your brother first." He exhaled a smoke ring.

A soft acknowledgment came through the phone.

"Update me when the surgery's over." He tapped ash into the tray. "I'll come by."

"Okay."

The call ended. Ethan immediately dialed another number. When Vincent Valois's voice came through, his eyes turned glacial.

"Did my last warning mean nothing to you?" His voice could freeze hell.

"Mr. Roscente, I've already reprimanded my son. He swore he wouldn't bother Miss Roland again."

Ethan's laugh held no warmth. "Then explain yesterday's hospital visit."

Vincent's voice faltered. "Th-that's impossible! He gave me his word! There must be some mistake—"

"Do I look blind to you?" Ethan's eyes narrowed.

"No! I'll call him immediately! This won't happen again!"

"Remember—this is your final courtesy call." Ethan crushed his cigarette. "If I see Lucien near Jenna again, you'll deal with the consequences."

......

Villa No.108, Clearwater Bay.

Vincent slammed down the phone. Face livid, he stormed upstairs. At his son's bedroom door, he forced himself to knock.

Lucien Valois opened the door, rubbing sleep from his eyes. "Father?"

"With me. Now." Vincent turned on his heel.

The study door banged shut. Lucien stood before the desk, irritation creasing his brow. "What's so urgent at this hour?"

Vincent's palm struck the wood. "Lucien Valois! Have you no respect for this family? For Yvonne?"

"What are you babbling about?"

"The hospital yesterday!" Vincent roared. "You promised to stay away from Jenna Roland! You're a married man! Must you disgrace us all?"

Lucien's pupils contracted. "How did you know I went to the hospital? Are you having me followed?"

"Followed?" Vincent sneered. "Final warning—approach Jenna again, and you're no son of mine."

Lucien stared at his father. He'd shaken all his bodyguards that day. How had Vincent known? Unless...he'd planted spies?
###Chapter 317

Lucien Valois clenched his fists, his burning gaze fixed on Vincent Valois. "Father, I must have her. In all these years, she's the only woman who's haunted my thoughts."

Vincent slammed his palm on the table, making the teacup rattle.

"Bullshit!" He jabbed a finger at his son's face. "You think I don't know about your escapades? Sleep with whoever you want—I never cared. But Jenna Roland is off-limits! If you dare approach her again, get out of the Valois family!"

"Why?" Lucien's voice trembled. "You never interfered in my personal life. Why is Jenna—"

"Because she belongs to Ethan Roscente!" Vincent's veins bulged on his forehead. "If Ethan hadn't called me that night, do you think I'd have bailed you out of that club?"

Lucien's pupils contracted.

He'd assumed Sylvia Savigny had tipped off his father. Not Ethan.

"What's their relationship?"

"None of your business." Vincent yanked at his loosened tie. "Remember this—if I want to keep my position, you stay away from Jenna Roland!"

Lucien sneered. "You're the mayor. Ethan's just a businessman—"

"Just a businessman?" Vincent laughed bitterly. "He controls the International Chamber of Commerce. Both sides of the law answer to him. Eighty percent of the nation's economic lifeline is in his grip. A man like that could remove me with a snap of his fingers."

Rain suddenly lashed against the windowpane.

The gravity of the situation finally struck Lucien. He remembered Jenna's slender waist beneath her chef's coat during their first meeting at the hospital. These sleepless nights, even when intimate with Yvonne, Jenna's aloof face haunted him.

It was an obsession bordering on sickness.

Vincent lit a cigarette, his eyes dark through the smoke. "You know what Yvonne is capable of. That girl from last time is still in the psychiatric ward. If she finds out about your fixation on Jenna—"

A chill crawled up Lucien's spine.

He could never forget the girl with severed breasts, her mutilated face. Yvonne sipping wine beside the carnage, smiling more terrifying than any demon.

"Father," he suddenly looked up, "why did you force me to marry Yvonne?"

Seven years of silence shattered with that question.
###Chapter 318

"How dare you ask me why?" Lucien Valois trembled with rage. "Without Yvonne, do you think you'd be sitting in the CEO chair of Fengho Group? Without her, you wouldn't even get near the chairman's position!"

Lucien's marriage had never been about love. It was a meticulously calculated transaction. Marrying Yvonne was his only ticket to taking over Fengho Group.

His son did possess business acumen. Unfortunately, that talent had been completely eroded by his endless affairs.

In the bedroom, Yvonne's phone suddenly rang.

She was applying serum in front of the mirror and casually pressed the answer button.

"Bridget, did you find anything?"

Her fingertips tapped lightly against her cheeks, producing crisp sounds.

"It's confirmed. He's been keeping a woman named Sylvia Savigny. The address is sent to your phone. How do you want to handle this?"

Yvonne turned on speakerphone and continued massaging her face.

"You know my rules." Her voice was as gentle as if discussing the weather. "Bring extra people. Start by ruining that face. Oh, and make sure to silence her mouth too."

The thought of that woman's lips touching Lucien made her stomach churn with disgust.

Hanging up, Yvonne smiled at her reflection, as if she'd just arranged an afternoon tea.

......

The operating room lights finally dimmed.

Nurses wheeled Milo out, heading straight to the ICU for observation. Only after the doctor finished explaining post-op care did Jenna Roland's tense nerves relax slightly.

When Liam Melford removed his surgical mask, his damp bangs clung to his forehead.

"Dr. Melford, the surgery..." Jenna's voice trembled.

"Was successful." His gaze rested on her pale face.

The sudden release of tension made her vision blur. Her body swayed forward uncontrollably.

Liam instinctively caught her.

For the first time, his hands touched a woman's body without surgical gloves.

The faint scent of roses from Jenna lingered around him. For a fleeting moment, Liam's focus wavered.

"Take her to emergency." He quickly regained composure, instructing his assistant. Behind his glasses, an imperceptible flicker of emotion passed through his eyes.
###Chapter 319

Jenna Roland opened her eyes to find Liam Melford and an unfamiliar woman standing before her. The sharp scent of disinfectant filled the air as medical equipment hummed around her.

"Dr. Melford, where am I?" She pushed herself up, her fingers brushing against the cold hospital sheets.

Liam adjusted his glasses. "The ER. Zoe and I found you unconscious in the hallway."

Memories flooded back—waiting outside the operating room. She massaged her temples. "Thank you."

Zoe studied her curiously. "You seem healthy. What caused the fainting spell?"

A loud stomach growl answered for her.

Jenna's ears burned. "I... haven't eaten all day." Her grip tightened on the blanket. "Milo was in surgery. I couldn't leave."

Liam's expression shifted. "The operation was successful. You should focus on your own health now."

Zoe brightened. "I'll grab food. You shouldn't be walking around like this."

"No need." Jenna waved her phone. "I'll order delivery."

Years of caring for her brother alone had taught her to never rely on others.

Liam said nothing, simply gesturing for Zoe to follow him out.

The ICU waiting room bench felt like ice. As Jenna opened the delivery app, Zoe reappeared.

"Here." She dropped two fruit candies into Jenna's palm. "For the low blood sugar."

The crinkling wrappers sounded unnaturally loud in the quiet hallway.

Inside the elevator, Zoe smirked. "Since when do you play nurse, Dr. Melford?"

Last month, he'd stepped over a fainting patient without breaking stride.

His reflection in the metal doors remained impassive. "Professional habit."

"Really?" Zoe arched a brow. "Then why specifically ask me to deliver candy?"

The doors slid shut, muffling his reply: "She reminds me of someone."
###Chapter 320

Liam Melford kept his eyes on the medical chart without looking up. "Ethan mentioned Jenna lost both parents. She's supporting herself while covering her brother's surgery fees. That's why she worked as a beverage promoter at the club—to raise funds."

"My God!" Zoe gasped. "Miss Roland has been through so much? Her brother's surgery costs at least eight hundred thousand. How could an ordinary person earn that much?"

Liam closed the file and glanced at her. "Ethan transferred a hundred thousand to my account. Make sure to return it."

"Understood, Dr. Melford."

Jenna finished her lunch box outside the ICU and rented a simple cot.

Three days later, the doctors finally declared Milo out of danger and ready to be moved to a regular ward.

Her tense shoulders relaxed at last.

The original VIP room was already occupied, so she had to apply for another.

The long sofa in the new ward saved her from renting another cot.

"What would you like to eat?" Jenna asked softly.

Milo shook his head weakly. "The doctor said... only porridge..."

"I'll get you some." She ruffled his hair and left.

Outside the hospital, she called Ethan. "Milo's been transferred to a regular ward."

"Good progress," came his deep voice.

"Yeah. I'm going to buy him porridge."

"I'll stop by after work."

After hanging up, Jenna walked briskly toward the porridge shop near the entrance.

At half past six, Ethan arrived punctually.

"Mr. Roscente..." Milo greeted from the bed.

Ethan gave a slight nod. "How are you feeling?"

"Much better. Thank you."

Jenna pulled up a chair. "Have a seat."

He sat gracefully, crossing his long legs. "Dr. Melford said recovery is smooth. He can be discharged within two weeks."

"Dr. Melford left already?" Jenna asked.

"His flight was this morning."

Milo spoke gratefully. "He was supposed to leave right after the surgery but stayed three extra days for me. Sis, we owe him big time."

Jenna smiled gently. "Once you're better, we'll thank him properly together."
###Chapter 321

After Milo was discharged from the hospital, Jenna prepared a family feast to thank everyone.

Milo had recovered quickly. By the time he left the hospital, he looked no different than before the surgery. The doctor only reminded him to continue taking anti-rejection medication.

The successful operation was largely due to Ethan and Justin's help. Jenna decided to cook a special meal for them.

Once Milo was settled at home, Jenna called both men. Justin agreed without hesitation, while Ethan was even more eager—he hadn't tasted Jenna's cooking in two weeks.

After hanging up, Jenna grabbed a shopping bag and headed to the nearby market. Remembering how Grandma Blanche and Grandpa Harrison had visited Milo often, she called to invite them too.

Grandma Blanche happily accepted.

In the kitchen, Jenna tied on her apron and got to work. Amid the clatter of cooking, the doorbell rang.

"Milo, can you get that?" Jenna called without looking up.

Milo set down the remote and hurried to the door. A stranger stood outside.

"Hello, may I ask who you are?"

"Justin Kemnis." The man smiled. "Your sister invited me for dinner."

Milo's eyes lit up. This was the man who had helped arrange his hospital stay! He stepped aside. "Please come in, Mr. Kemnis."

Justin glanced around the living room. "Ethan isn't here yet?"

"Mr. Roscente will come after work." Milo handed him a glass of water. "Here, have some water."

Justin took the glass and pulled out a cigarette case. "Mind if I smoke?"

"Not at all." Milo smiled.

As smoke curled through the air, Justin asked, "Your sister's in the kitchen?"

"Yeah, she's cooking dinner." Just then, the sound of a key turning came from the entrance.

Both turned toward the foyer.

Ethan walked in, his black trench coat carrying the chill from outside. He frowned, his gaze landing on the cigarette in Justin's hand.
###Chapter 322

The door slammed shut with a bang as Ethan Roscente strode into the living room, his expression stormy.

Justin Kemnis was lounging on the couch, a cigarette dangling from his lips. Through the haze of smoke, he caught sight of Ethan's icy glare and immediately straightened up.

"Milo just got discharged from the hospital. What are you doing smoking around him?" Ethan's voice was sharp as frost.

Justin blinked, glancing at Milo Roland on the sofa.

Milo quickly waved his hands. "It's fine, Mr. Roscente. I don't mind."

Ethan didn't spare Milo a glance, his gaze fixed on Justin. "Put it out."

Justin looked down at his half-smoked cigarette, then at the tense line of Ethan's jaw. He hastily stubbed it out in the ashtray.

Ethan loosened his tie and rolled up his sleeves, revealing muscular forearms.

"I'll help in the kitchen." He pointed a warning finger at Justin. "If I catch you smoking again..."

Justin raised his hands in surrender. "Got it, got it."

The kitchen door was slightly ajar. Ethan pushed it open.

Jenna Roland was focused on chopping carrots, her knife moving with practiced ease.

"I'll handle this." Ethan's sudden voice made her jump, the knife nearly nicking her finger.

She looked up at him, disbelief written across her face.

"Problem?" Ethan frowned.

Jenna swallowed. "No, I can manage—"

Ethan snatched the knife from her hand. "You're too slow."

Jenna stepped back, watching as he picked up a carrot.

"You know how to chop vegetables?" she ventured cautiously.

Ethan didn't respond. The knife came down in swift strokes.

Moments later, Jenna stared at the uneven carrot strips on the cutting board, her lips twitching.

"Um..." she said diplomatically, "maybe I should take over?"

Ethan didn't look up. "Go cook your chicken wings."

Jenna turned away silently and began preparing the cola chicken wings. As the water boiled for blanching the wings, she stole glances at Ethan's knife skills.

Some carrot strips were as thick as fries, others as thin as toothpicks.

Ethan transferred the chopped carrots to a plate and picked up a stalk of lettuce.

"Sliced or shredded?" he asked.

Jenna forced a smile. "Sliced."

When the lettuce slices appeared on the board, her expression froze.

Some were paper-thin, others thick enough to build a wall.
###Chapter 323 

Ethan's knife wobbled unsteadily across the lettuce, producing uneven slices—some as thick as coins, others paper-thin.

Jenna glanced at the cutting board. The thickest piece could rival a quarter in width.

His knife skills were downright disastrous.

She wanted to shoo him out, but he stubbornly insisted on helping. What should've been a three-hour dinner prep now stretched to four.

Those chunky lettuce slices would take at least forty minutes to cook through.

With a sigh, Jenna transferred the golden crispy chicken wings to a plate. She added rock sugar to the pan, letting it slowly caramelize into amber syrup over low heat.

The wings went back in, glazed with the glossy sauce. She popped open a can of cola and poured it in with a fizz.

A sharp inhale came from beside her.

Jenna turned to see a drop of blood fall from Ethan's index finger onto the cutting board.

She killed the burner and rushed over. The gash looked nasty, blood welling steadily.

"I told you not to chop anything!" She grabbed his wrist and without hesitation, took his injured finger into her mouth.

Ethan's pupils constricted.

The warm pressure around his wound stunned him. He stared, dumbfounded, as she kept his finger between her lips, unfazed by the metallic tang.

"You—"

Jenna spat out the blood and met his gaze. "Wait here. I'll get a bandage."

Ethan remained rooted, the tips of his ears turning pink. He pressed his lips together, still feeling the ghost of hers against his skin.

Jenna returned swiftly, tearing open a pink Hello Kitty band-aid.

"Not deep. This'll do for a couple days." She dressed the wound efficiently. "Go wait in the living room. I've got this."

Ethan frowned at the childish cartoon print now adorning his finger. "Sorry for being more hindrance than help."

Jenna's eyes crinkled like crescent moons. "Appreciate the thought." She checked the clock and sighed internally.

Ethan slipped his left hand into his pocket and exited silently. Justin and Milo chatted in the living room, neither noticing his passing.

He headed straight for the bedroom and shut the door.

Not long after, Grandma Blanche and Grandpa Harrison arrived.

"Milo, where's Ethan?" Grandma Blanche scanned the room, finding only the two young men.
###Chapter 324

"Grandma Blanche, Mr. Roscente is resting in the bedroom," Milo Roland replied softly.

Grandma Blanche nodded in understanding. "I thought he hadn't arrived yet." She guided Grandpa Harrison Roscente to sit on the sofa.

Milo turned toward the kitchen and returned with two glasses of water.

"Thank you," Grandma Blanche said, taking a sip.

She patted the empty space beside her. "Don't just stand there. Sit down."

Milo obediently took a seat next to Justin Kemnis.

"How's your recovery going?" Grandma Blanche asked with concern.

"I'm completely fine now," Milo smiled. "All my test results are normal."

Grandma Blanche nodded approvingly. "Dr. Melford truly lives up to his reputation."

"Yes," Milo's eyes shimmered with gratitude. "If Dr. Melford hadn't performed the surgery, the consequences would've been unthinkable."

Grandma Harrison interjected, "Choosing Dr. Melford was the right decision."

Suddenly remembering something, Grandma Blanche added, "Oh, Dr. Melford has transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital now. We should properly thank him. How about inviting him to dinner the day after tomorrow?"

"Whatever you say," Grandpa Harrison agreed readily.

Milo looked surprised. "Wasn't Dr. Melford at Mayo Clinic?"

"His hometown is Los Angeles," Grandma Blanche explained. "His parents urged him to return for work and to settle down."

Milo's expression cleared with understanding.

As the aroma of food wafted from the kitchen, the clock struck six.

Jenna Roland emerged carrying the final dish. "Dinner's ready!"

She deftly arranged the tableware before heading to the living room to call everyone.

Grandma Blanche looked apologetic. "You've worked so hard preparing all this alone."

"It's nothing," Jenna wiped her hands. "I'll go get Ethan."

In the bedroom, Ethan Roscente was wrapping up a phone call.

"Dinner's ready," Jenna reminded him gently.

Ethan quickly ended the call and followed her to the dining room.

Everyone had already taken their seats.

Justin raised an eyebrow at the shredded carrots. "Jenna, this knife work doesn't seem like yours."

Milo pointed at the haphazardly sliced cucumbers. "Sis, these cuts are... unusually bold."

Ethan remained silent, keeping his left hand under the table while using his right to pick up a chicken wing.

"The presentation might be lacking," Justin chewed on a carrot, "but the flavor's actually good."

Ethan's expression darkened. "Can't you just eat quietly?"

Justin looked baffled. "I was complimenting the food. Why are you upset?"

Grandma Blanche's gaze landed on Ethan's left hand. "Oh? That bandage..."

She squinted. "Is that... a Hello Kitty Band-Aid?"
###Chapter 325

Grandma Blanche's gaze landed on Ethan Roscente's hand and suddenly noticed a pink Hello Kitty Band-Aid on his left index finger.

The adorable bandage created a striking contrast with his usual cold demeanor.

Grandpa Harrison Roscente frowned with concern. "Ethan, what happened to your hand?"

"Just a minor cut," Ethan replied flatly, continuing to serve himself from the dishes.

Justin Kemnis stared at the shredded carrots on the table, abruptly recalling how finely Jenna Roland had sliced them during their last meal together.

His head snapped up, eyes widening in disbelief. "Did you chop these?"

Grandma Blanche gasped in realization. "No wonder they're so uneven—Jenna's knife skills are impeccable."

She could hardly believe it. Ethan, who had never lifted a finger in the kitchen his entire life, had actually helped with meal prep today.

Ethan kept eating stoically, though the tips of his ears turned faintly pink.

Grandpa Harrison burst into hearty laughter. "Never thought I'd see the day our Ethan cooks for his wife! Splendid!"

Only then did Jenna realize Ethan had never stepped foot in their home kitchen before.

Grandma Blanche tactfully changed the subject. "It's been two weeks since I last tasted Jenna's cooking. I'm having extra servings tonight."

"Please enjoy, Grandma." Jenna smiled, serving her another portion.

The dinner lasted nearly two hours.

When Ethan moved to help clear the table, Jenna noticed his injured finger and firmly ushered him to the living room to entertain their elders.

Alone in the kitchen facing a mountain of dishes, Jenna was startled when Grandma Blanche reappeared.

"Let me assist you," the elderly woman said, rolling up her sleeves.

Jenna quickly intercepted her. "You should rest, Grandma. I can handle this."

She thought to herself that if anyone should help, it should be Milo—certainly not an octogenarian.
###Chapter 326

"I really shouldn't trouble you like this." Grandma Blanche hesitated.

Jenna Roland smiled slightly. "Please don't stand on ceremony. It's good for young people to stay active. Let me handle the dishes."

"Well then." The elderly woman relented, watching warmly from the side. "Jenna, Milo mentioned you're planning to treat Dr. Melford to dinner?"

Jenna continued washing without pause. "He traveled all the way here to perform Milo's surgery. We didn't pay any fees or give gifts. Since the operation went so well, we both felt we should express our gratitude. But he wasn't in town, so we planned to arrange something when he returned."

"You absolutely should thank him properly." Grandma Blanche nodded. "Actually, Dr. Melford has already come back. He's now the head of cardiac surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital. If you'd like to invite him, Ethan can provide his contact information."

The plate nearly slipped from Jenna's hands. She turned abruptly. "Dr. Melford went to Johns Hopkins? Why?"

"He's already in his thirties and still single. His family is anxious. Besides, he's originally from Los Angeles with both parents living here. Returning makes it easier for them to... encourage his marital prospects."

"How does Grandma know all these details?"

The older woman chuckled. "A friend of mine knows Dr. Melford's grandmother. I heard about it yesterday while shopping. Since he operated on Milo, I made some inquiries for you. Just ask Ethan for the phone number if you want to invite him."

"I see." Jenna resumed washing. "That works, though I'll need to wait a few days."

"Why?" Grandma Blanche looked puzzled.

Jenna explained, "I've decided against opening a restaurant. First, I'm going to sell clothes at a street stall. My current e-bike can't transport goods, so tomorrow I need to buy an e-tricycle."

"You're going to be a street vendor?!" The elderly woman's eyes widened.

She had previously suggested Jenna open a small eatery, even offering financial support. Never did she imagine Jenna would choose street vending instead.

While there was no shame in honest work, operating alone would be grueling. Constantly evading urban management officers meant risking entire days' earnings—or even injury—if caught. How could this delicate young woman endure such hardship?

Seeing Grandma Blanche's shocked reaction, Jenna turned. "Yes, is there a problem?"

The older woman's voice softened with concern. "Do you realize how difficult street vending is? Exposure to wind and sun aside, what will you do when urban management shows up? A small restaurant would be much better. If money's an issue, we can help. Don't subject yourself to this!"

Jenna understood the kind intentions. But restaurants required six-figure investments—too risky without experience. A failed venture could mean financial ruin.

She laid out her reservations point by point.

Grandma Blanche listened patiently before responding, "Why fear failure? Everyone starts somewhere. Consider our investment a gift—no repayment expected even if you lose money. Just focus on running the restaurant with peace of mind."

Jenna pressed her lips together. "Grandma, the stakes are too high with zero experience. The pressure would overwhelm me. I'd rather gain experience vending first, then consider a proper shop when I'm ready."
###Chapter 327

Grandma Blanche studied Jenna Roland's resolute gaze and knew her mind was made up.

"How much capital are you preparing?"

"A few thousand dollars will suffice. Low risk, perfect for gaining experience."

The elderly woman gave Jenna's shoulder a gentle pat.

"Do your best. Gaining experience is what matters most."

A faint smile touched Jenna's lips.

"Thank you for your support, Grandma."

"I never said I supported you becoming a street vendor."

Grandma Blanche sighed.

"But if you wish to try, I won't stand in your way."

"Success or failure, it'll be valuable experience."

Jenna nodded.

"I want to start small, with less pressure."

"Hmm."

Another pat from Grandma Blanche.

"You wash the dishes first. I'll be in the living room."

In the living room, Ethan Roscente was discussing company matters with Grandpa Harrison.

Milo Roland had already retreated to his room, and Justin Kemnis had left right after dinner.

"Ethan, come to the balcony."

Grandma Blanche headed straight for the balcony without waiting for a response.

Ethan closed the French doors behind him and regarded the elderly woman.

"What is it?"

"Jenna plans to start street vending. Did you know?"

"No."

His brows furrowed slightly.

He'd assumed she would open a restaurant. Street vending hadn't crossed his mind.

"She just told me."

Grandma Blanche lowered her voice.

"I tried to dissuade her, but she said running a restaurant would be too stressful."

"Selling what?"

"Clothing."

She added,

"She's even buying an e-tricycle tomorrow. Seems determined."

"Let her."

Ethan's tone was indifferent.

Grandma Blanche stared at him in surprise.

"Aren't you concerned?"

"If that's what she wants."

He avoided her gaze, pulling out a cigarette case.

Exasperated, Grandma Blanche swatted his arm.

"Talking to you is exhausting!"

She yanked open the French doors and stormed off in a huff.

Leaning against the balcony railing, Ethan watched the flower beds below through wisps of smoke.

Jenna's image surfaced in his mind.

He hadn't expected her to choose street vending.

Taking one final deep drag, he stubbed out the cigarette and returned to the living room.

The spacious room stood empty now.

When Jenna emerged from the kitchen, Ethan's eyes lifted to meet hers.

"Grandma says you're starting street vending?"
###Chapter 328

Jenna stood at the doorway, nervously twisting the hem of her shirt. Ethan's intense gaze made her fidget.

"Did Grandma Blanche tell you?" she asked softly.

Ethan set down the documents and motioned for her to sit. "Yes. I know the CEO of a startup. Good benefits. I can refer you if you're interested."

Jenna pressed her lips together, her eyes crinkling into crescents. "Thank you for thinking of me. But I've decided to try street vending."

"Why?" His brow furrowed. "A company would suit you better."

She shook her head, absently tracing the armrest. "You've already done so much for me. Besides, with my education, I wouldn't be much help in an office."

Abruptly, she stood. "I'm going to shower."

Before he could respond, she hurried into the bedroom, the door clicking shut behind her.

Ethan stared at the closed door, his expression unreadable.

The next morning, sunlight streamed through the windows as Jenna browsed an e-bike shop. A red e-tricycle with a windshield caught her eye.

"This model has a weather shield and safety rails," the owner explained. "Add a canopy for just $600."

Her face lit up. She purchased it immediately.

After the canopy installation, she eagerly took it for a spin. The vibrant red vehicle turned heads as she rode through the streets.

With the license secured, Jenna scouted locations. She settled on an alleyway near Mall of America, already bustling with vendors.

Over the next two days, she gathered supplies—clothing racks, cardboard boxes, hangers, even a portable steamer.

At the wholesale market at dawn, she meticulously selected merchandise. Laden with three bulging bags, she hired two porters to help carry them.

Back at her stall, she swiftly set up the racks. Each garment was steamed smooth, wrinkles vanishing in the hiss of vapor.

"Need help, dear?" The shoe vendor next door, Tanya, offered.

They finished arranging quickly. Jenna bought Chinese leek pancakes and soy milk to share.

"Thanks, Auntie." She took a bite, watching the growing foot traffic with hopeful eyes.
###Chapter 329

Jenna swallowed the last bite of her steamed bun. The soy milk cup was empty.

The auntie at the neighboring stall was enthusiastically helping her arrange the clothing rack. After hesitating, Jenna spoke up, "What should I call you?"

"Tanya Hill. Just call me Aunt Tanya." The shoe vendor efficiently stacked shoeboxes and smiled at her.

"I'm Jenna." She clenched the hem of her shirt, the fabric slightly damp in her palm. "Have you been vending here long, Aunt Tanya?"

"Two years and three months." Tanya wiped dust off a shoe with a cloth. "Since the very first day this market opened."

"Always selling shoes?"

"Yep. My lifelong trade."

Before she finished speaking, a silver-haired grandmother stopped at the shoe stall. Tanya winked at Jenna. "We'll chat later."

Jenna watched as Tanya swiftly pulled out a pair of maroon mesh shoes. The elderly woman's wrinkles crinkled with joy as she tried them on.

Just as the eighty-dollar sale concluded, two ponytailed girls appeared at Jenna's clothing rack.

"Feel free to browse!" Jenna nearly knocked over her iron.

The taller girl pinched a white cotton T-shirt. "How much?"

"Sixty." Jenna shook out the collar to show the reinforced stitching. "Won't lose shape even after thirty machine washes."

"Will this match?" The girl's friend held up denim shorts.

The pale blue fabric glowed softly in the sunlight. In the end, they bought three items.

As Jenna tied the last shopping bag, another customer lifted the dust cover.

At some point, Tanya had returned and began handing her hangers. Three hours later, Jenna had restocked her tricycle twice.

While pressing the final shirt, she heard Tanya ask, "Made around five hundred today?"

"Gross profit four-seventy." Steam fogged Jenna's lashes. "Fabric costs ate sixty percent."

"All beginners start that way." Tanya kicked aside an empty shoebox. "By the way, don't come Wednesdays or Fridays."

The iron suddenly hissed. Jenna turned it off. "Will they confiscate the merchandise?"
###Chapter 330

Tanya Hill deftly arranged the merchandise on her stall. "The Urban Management Officers patrol every day, but they only stay on this street for two hours. Once they leave, we can set up again."

Jenna Roland frowned, her fingers absently tracing the edge of a clothing rack. "What happens if we get caught?"

"What do you think?" Tanya shrugged. "They confiscate your goods and fine you. If you're too slow, they'll even take your cart. So the moment you see them coming, you grab everything and run."

"That serious?" Jenna inhaled sharply.

Tanya lowered her voice. "This street isn’t zoned for street vending. We’re operating under the radar—getting caught comes with consequences."

"Have you ever been caught?" Jenna couldn’t help asking.

"Once." Tanya winked mysteriously. "But I know someone on the enforcement team, so they let me off." A customer interrupted before she could finish.

Jenna didn’t press further. She meticulously smoothed out each garment and loaded backup stock into the cart.

It was Tuesday—the officers shouldn’t be making rounds today. Jenna silently counted her blessings.

Perched on a folding stool, she scanned the racks of hanging clothes. She’d rehearsed the escape plan endlessly in her mind: yank everything down, shove it into the cart, abandon the cheap hangers.

As long as she moved fast enough, no one could catch her.

From dawn until 5:30 PM, Jenna stayed planted at her stall.

"Packing up already?" Tanya eyed her in surprise as she started dismantling the display.

Jenna smiled. "Someone’s waiting at home for dinner."

"But this is peak rush hour—prime selling time." Tanya urged, "At least stay till seven."

Seven was exactly when Ethan Roscente got off work. Luckily, Milo Roland was home on break and could whip up something simple.

After a moment’s thought, Jenna took Tanya’s advice. She pulled out her phone and called Ethan. "I’ll be at the stall till seven. Handle dinner yourself tonight."

His calm acknowledgment through the receiver eased her tension.

"You could actually stay till nine," Tanya suggested, leaning in. "The shoppers from Mall of America love browsing around then."

"Too late." Jenna shook her head.

"Then come at nine in the morning and stay till seven. You’d still make decent money."

"That’s the plan." Jenna nodded firmly.

This was her job—she had to give it her all. If not for Ethan and Milo, she’d have worked straight through midnight.

But money could never be fully earned. If her health collapsed, no amount of cash would matter. She had to pace herself.
###Chapter 331

The setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange as Jenna Roland efficiently packed up the clothes from her street stall. She climbed onto her e-tricycle and headed home.

The tricycle glided smoothly through the Beverly Hills neighborhood, soon stopping at her apartment building.

Staring at the fully loaded vehicle, Jenna frowned. Leaving the clothes unattended outside was an open invitation for thieves. But hauling everything upstairs alone would be exhausting.

She pulled out her phone and dialed Ethan Roscente first.

"Still at work?" Hearing he wasn't home yet, she hung up without another word.

Next, she called Milo Roland. "Come downstairs. I need help."

Soon, Milo appeared at the entrance. He circled the tricycle. "What's up, sis?"

"Watch the cart while I carry these upstairs." Jenna wiped sweat from her forehead. "If no one guards them, these clothes will disappear in a blink."

"Let me help you." Milo pointed at the four large bags. "Two people can finish faster."

"No!" Jenna's refusal was firm. "The doctor said you need rest. Just stay here and keep watch. I'll handle it."

Gritting her teeth, she hoisted one bag onto her shoulder. The woven sack was stuffed to the brim, weighing heavily against her.

After four exhausting trips, Jenna finally transported all the clothes inside. She collapsed onto the couch, panting heavily.

Milo handed her a glass of water, his voice laced with concern. "Sis, maybe you should find an easier job. I can take on part-time work."

"Part-time jobs don't pay like running your own business." Jenna took a sip, her eyes brightening. "I made $1,500 today—over $900 in profit!"

"That much?" Milo's eyes widened in surprise.

"Yep. These clothes have low wholesale costs, and I sell them cheap." She counted on her fingers. "Tell me, could I earn $900 a day at some office job?"

After a thoughtful pause, Milo suddenly suggested, "What if I help you at the stall? I'm on break now. I can assist with customers and carrying stock."

"Perfect!" Jenna slapped her thigh. "That's light work you can definitely handle!"

As they spoke, the front door lock clicked. Ethan walked in, and Milo tactfully retreated to his room.
###Chapter 332

Night deepened as Jenna Roland carried the last sack of clothes into the living room. Beads of sweat slid down her flushed cheeks.

Ethan Roscente pushed the door open, his suit jacket draped carelessly over his arm.

"Had dinner?" Jenna straightened up, wiping her forehead.

"Yeah." His gaze lingered on her heated face. His Adam's apple bobbed. "You—"

The words died on his lips.

Jenna tilted her head. "Something wrong?"

"Nothing." He turned toward the bedroom. "I'm taking a shower."

In the kitchen, Jenna stared blankly at the bubbling pot of noodles. She'd stood at the night market for eight hours straight without even a sip of water.

As she set the bowl on the table, Ethan emerged, towel-drying his hair. Droplets traced the sharp lines of his collarbones before disappearing beneath his shirt.

"What are those?" He pointed to the burlap sacks in the corner.

Her chopsticks paused. "New inventory. The e-tricycle couldn't fit..." She bit her lip. "I'll move them tomorrow—"

"Your call." He cut her off. "This is your home too."

The bedroom light went out. Jenna curled up on her floor bedding, every muscle screaming. Just as her eyelids grew heavy, the crisp sound of turning pages came from above.

"Tired?" Ethan's voice cut through the darkness.

Jenna's eyes flew open.

"Mr. Roscente actually cares?" She chuckled, rolling onto her back.

Another page turned. Moonlight outlined the rigid line of his jaw.

"Don't flatter yourself."

She stared at the ceiling. "Exhausted, sure. But every piece sold feels like watching a flower bloom."

The book snapped shut. Suddenly Ethan loomed over her, his shadow swallowing her whole. His fingers grazed her calloused palm.

"You really..." His voice dropped. "Know how to find joy in hardship."
###Chapter 333

Ethan Roscente closed the financial magazine in his hands, his deep gaze settling on Jenna Roland.

"How much did you earn today?"

Jenna's eyes lit up as she sat straighter, excitement bubbling in her voice. "Fifteen hundred in sales, with over nine hundred in profit! But the real win was the experience. Not bad, right?"

Ethan remained silent.

Nine hundred dollars made her this happy?

She was far too easily satisfied.

He did the math. With her qualifications, she'd earn at most five or six thousand a month in a corporate job. But if she consistently made nine hundred daily, her monthly income could reach thirty grand.

To him, that amount was negligible. Yet it made Jenna beam with joy.

"Your happiness threshold is remarkably low."

"What choice do I have?" Jenna sighed. "My parents passed early, and I have to support my brother's education. Even three hundred a day would be enough for me. Youth is capital—as long as I'm willing to work hard, success will come eventually."

Ethan reopened his magazine. "Effort must yield returns. Otherwise, it's a waste of life."

Jenna bit her lip. "I know you look down on street vending. But I want to try. If there's no progress in a few months, I'll find a stable job."

His gaze sharpened. "If you choose this path, see it through. Don't turn back unless you're facing a cliff. Opportunities only favor those who persist. Quitting guarantees failure."

Jenna stiffened.

She sat up straighter, her eyes glistening.

All those years at her uncle's house, she'd only heard belittlement and insults. This was the first time someone had spoken such encouraging words to her.

"Ethan," she inhaled deeply, "I've decided. As long as you don't bring up divorce, I'll stay with you for life!"

He arched a brow. "A few words, and you're sold?"

"Because you gave me hope." Jenna smiled. "When I'm rich, I'll invest in you too."

The corner of Ethan's mouth twitched imperceptibly before settling back into neutrality.

"Focus on yourself first."

Jenna lay back on her floor bedding. "Ethan, are you really content being a supervisor at HM Group for the rest of your life?"

"Sleep if you're tired," he replied flatly.

"I was almost asleep until you asked that."

"Being content isn't necessarily a bad thing." Ethan stared at the magazine without reading a single word.

His gaze drifted unconsciously toward the figure on the floor.
###Chapter 334

"Is that all you aspire to?" Ethan chuckled softly, closing his eyes. "But you're right—a peaceful life does sound appealing."

The salary at Roscente Group was generous, with a monthly income in the tens of thousands and a respectable career. Staying until retirement wouldn't be a bad choice.

But she had to work twice as hard. Milo deserved nothing less than the best.

She had endured enough hardship. Now, she only wanted to give him a comfortable life.

Starting today, she would give it her all to carve out a future.

Jenna claimed she wasn't tired, but sleep claimed her soon after she shut her eyes. Especially when Ethan fell silent, she drifted off effortlessly.

Hearing her steady breathing below, Ethan set aside his magazine and sat up. His gaze lingered on her sleeping face, intense and unreadable.

He once thought Jenna had ulterior motives, even suspected her of deceiving Grandma Blanche. But he later realized she wasn't that kind of person.

He used to avoid her at all costs. Now, he couldn't stop thinking about her—wondering what she was doing, if she was well.

Perhaps he had truly fallen for this stubborn yet simple girl.

A silent smile curved his lips. Carefully, he slipped out of bed and knelt beside her. His fingers brushed her cheek.

Her skin was slightly rough, tinged with faint redness, yet carried a comforting warmth.

He turned off the light and lay down beside her.

He only meant to rest briefly before returning to bed. But before he knew it, dawn had arrived.

......

Jenna woke at seven sharp. Stretching, her arm bumped against something warm.

She turned abruptly—only to find Ethan sleeping right beside her!

Oh god!

She scrambled away, heart pounding. Staring at his peaceful face, a whirlwind of thoughts raced through her mind.

Had he done something last night? Or had he accidentally rolled off the bed? Or... had he chosen to lie beside her?

If it was the latter... did that mean he liked her?

The man who once barely spoke to her now found every excuse to be near her.

Could it be... Ethan Roscente had actually fallen for her?
###Chapter 335

Jenna Roland stared at Ethan Roscente's sleeping face, then violently shook her head.
She needed to crush this ridiculous thought immediately.

What if he never meant anything by it? She'd just be making a fool of herself.

Taking a deep breath, she carefully lifted the blanket.
She grabbed the sweater from the foot of the bed and tiptoed to the bathroom.
The faucet was running when the sizzle of frying eggs came from the kitchen.

Sunlight stabbed Ethan's eyelids awake. The other side of the bed lay empty.
He stared at the ceiling, ears suddenly burning.
Did that girl misunderstand something?

Then again—
If she truly hated him, she would've smacked him with a pillow last night.
Since she didn't...
Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed as his thumb absently stroked the quilt corner.

"Knock knock."
Jenna's voice came through the door. "Breakfast is ready."
Ethan sprang up like a fish, nearly tripping over his slippers.

"I sleepwalk," he blurted with a straight face.
Jenna tilted her head, blinking those long lashes twice.
The king-sized bed versus the narrow floor bedding—
Even a toddler wouldn't buy that pathetic excuse.

"Got it." She turned away, suppressing a laugh. "Come get your eggs."
Ethan suddenly grabbed her swinging ponytail.
"You actually believe me?"
Jenna turned to see fractured sunlight dancing in his eyes.

Steam rose from the millet porridge on the table.
Milo Roland sneaked a hand toward the bacon, only to get whacked by Jenna's chopsticks.
"Wait for everyone," she scolded.
Ethan approached, drying his damp hair. "Your house has too many rules."

"Family tradition." Jenna served him a third bowl.
Ethan abruptly caught her wrist. "About last night—"
"Five trips for the clothes!" Jenna yanked free and bolted to the living room.

Ethan caught up in three strides, hoisting the largest bag one-handed.
"Hey!" Jenna jumped for his shoulder. "I said I'd do it!"
He easily held the package overhead, grinning at her ruffled expression.
"Beg me."

Milo's shout echoed up the stairwell: "Sis! The taxi's leaving!"
Ethan seized the chance to stash the bag in the trunk. When he turned, Jenna collided with him, breathless.
Her nose glistened with sweat, eyes bright as constellations.
"Thank—"
"Hotpot next time." Ethan flicked her forehead.
###Chapter 336 

Jenna hung the last piece of clothing on the rack and clapped her hands. "Thanks, Ethan."

"Don't mention it." Ethan stood nearby, his gaze sweeping over the neatly arranged stall.

Milo hopped onto the back of the e-tricycle effortlessly. Jenna started the vehicle and headed straight for Mall of America.

As soon as they arrived, Milo jumped off to help. The siblings worked in perfect sync, quickly displaying all the garments on the racks.

At exactly nine o'clock, the stall opened for business.

Tanya from the neighboring shoe stall wheeled her cart over, eyebrows lifting in surprise. "You're early today, Jenna."

"Yeah, Aunt Tanya." Jenna smiled at her.

After setting up her own stall, Tanya sat on a small stool to rest. She studied Milo curiously. "And who's this?"

"My brother Milo. He's still in high school." Jenna introduced them. "Milo, this is Aunt Tanya."

"Hello, ma'am." Milo greeted politely.

Tanya's eyes brightened. "You two look so alike. Both so handsome."

Jenna shook her head with a laugh. "Not at all."

"Oh please, standing together you look like celebrities." Tanya teased.

Milo's ears turned pink as he busied himself with arranging clothes.

Tanya suddenly lowered her voice. "By the way, it's Wednesday. The urban management officers will be making rounds. Be careful."

"Thanks for the warning." Jenna nodded.

Milo frowned at his sister. "They're coming today?"

"Every Wednesday and Friday." Jenna explained quietly.

Milo felt relieved he'd come along. His sister would've struggled alone if the officers showed up.

"They usually come in the afternoon. Keep an eye out." Tanya added.

Jenna nodded gratefully. Tanya's heads-up allowed her to prepare in advance.

......

At 2:30 PM, while Jenna was assisting a customer, Tanya's shout cut through the air: "Urban management! Run!"

Chaos erupted instantly. Vendors scrambled to pack up their goods.

Jenna and Milo worked swiftly, clearing their stall before the officers arrived. Seeing Tanya still struggling, Jenna immediately sent Milo to help.

"Go ahead, sis!" Milo called out.

Jenna sped away on the e-tricycle. Tanya and Milo threw shoes into the cart, not even pausing for thanks before pedaling off.

When the officers arrived, only Milo remained standing there. Since he wasn't a vendor, they couldn't do anything to him.

Several elderly vendors who moved too slowly got stopped, their goods confiscated, leaving them to pay fines at the enforcement office.

Once the coast was clear, Milo called Jenna. "Sis, it's safe to come back."

Five minutes later, Jenna and Tanya returned to their spots. As they set up again, complaints buzzed around them.

"We weren't even blocking the sidewalk! Why chase us off?"
"Exactly! Just trying to make an honest living here."

Tanya approached Jenna sincerely. "We owe you big time today."

Jenna waved it off. "Don't mention it."

"If you hadn't helped, I would've lost this entire shipment." Tanya said, still shaken.
###Chapter 337

Jenna licked her dry lips and whispered, "Aunt Tanya, didn't you say we had connections? Why are you still so afraid of the urban management officers?"

Tanya sighed, twisting the hem of her shirt. "He helped us out the last five times we got caught. But even the best connections can't handle constant trouble."

"I see." Jenna nodded. "Let's watch out for each other from now on."

A relieved smile crossed Tanya's face before she returned to her own stall.

The street's tension eased after evading the officers.

Soon, a crowd gathered around Jenna's stall.

She noticed a pattern—once someone stopped to browse, more customers would follow.

The booming business became overwhelming.

During the rush, she and Milo couldn't keep up. Two women slipped away with stolen clothes.

Without surveillance and with Tanya busy, they had to swallow the loss.

After the crowd thinned, Jenna stormed over to Tanya. "How could they be so shameless? The clothes aren't even expensive!"

Tanya wiped her sweat. "There are regular thieves on this street. You need to stay alert."

"I saw them!" A middle-aged fruit vendor chimed in. "They stuffed the clothes into their bags and walked off like nothing happened."

Jenna and Tanya exchanged a look—both recognizing the woman's cold indifference.

They silently agreed to ignore her.

Just then, a black Maybach pulled up across the street.

The luxury car instantly drew everyone's attention.

Tinted windows shielded the interior from prying eyes.

Milo gaped. "Sis! That's a Maybach! My life would be complete if I could drive something like that."

Jenna didn't look up. "Study hard, and you'll afford any car someday."

"Yeah, right." He scoffed. "Unless you're the boss, who can buy a million-dollar car?"

Inside the Maybach, Ethan Roscente's long fingers tapped rhythmically against his knee.

His black shirt accentuated his broad shoulders and narrow waist. His wristwatch gleamed coldly under the sunlight.

His intense gaze pierced through the window, fixed on Jenna as she worked.

The corners of his stern lips lifted unconsciously when she smiled.

Assistant Lucas followed his boss's line of sight, mentally noting the girl selling clothes.
###Chapter 338

Lucas Roscente was organizing documents when Ethan Roscente's deep voice came from behind. "Go buy some clothes from that stall."

Lucas froze.

He turned stiffly toward the roadside vendor—a women's clothing stall. Him? Buying women's clothes?

But Ethan's orders were never to be questioned. Lucas swallowed hard. "Yes, Mr. Roscente."

He stepped out of the car and trudged toward the stall.

As he approached, Lucas studied the vendor. The young woman with a ponytail didn't seem like someone who'd have any connection to Ethan.

Was this sudden charity? That didn't sound like Ethan.

"How much for this dress?" Lucas picked up a pink sundress at random.

Jenna Roland frowned slightly. The man in the tailored suit didn't look like the type to buy such clothes.

But she quickly smiled professionally. "Eighty-five dollars. It's chiffon—perfect for summer."

"Wrap it up." Lucas didn't hesitate.

Jenna neatly folded the dress into a bag. Lucas selected several more items without asking prices.

"That'll be $435 total," Jenna said. "Cash or card?"

"Card." Lucas scanned the payment and turned to leave with the bags.

Milo Roland whispered, "Sis, that guy didn't even haggle. Wish all customers were like that."

Jenna shook her head with a smile. "In business, you meet all kinds." Her gaze lingered on Lucas as he climbed into the black Maybach.

What she didn't notice were the piercing eyes watching her intently from behind the tinted window.
###Chapter 339

Ethan Roscente's gaze lingered on the slender figure until she disappeared around the street corner. The warmth in his eyes faded, replaced by a cold sharpness.

"Mr. Roscente, the clothes are ready. Should I deliver them to you?" Lucas Roscente, his assistant, asked cautiously from the driver's seat.

"No need." Ethan withdrew his gaze. "Take me back to the office."

"Understood." Lucas placed the shopping bag on the passenger seat and started the car.

At seven in the evening, Jenna Roland finished packing up her street stall and pedaled her e-tricycle home.

Three men in black suits stood smoking under her apartment building. Jenna glanced at them but paid no mind. She parked and was about to unload her goods when one of them suddenly spoke.

"Need help?"

Jenna eyed them warily and shook her head. "No, thanks."

She struggled to drag a large bag of clothes toward the entrance. Unexpectedly, the three men picked up the remaining packages without prompting.

"What are you doing?" Milo Roland immediately stepped forward to block them.

The leader flashed a friendly smile. "You looked like you could use a hand."

Jenna, now at her door, turned back. "We don't know each other. Why help me?"

The man pulled out his ID. "We just moved in—seventh floor. Check my ID if you're worried."

Jenna hesitated. She'd never encountered such eager strangers before.

"You live here too?" she asked skeptically.

"Yeah, seventh floor." He pocketed his ID. "Which floor are you on?"

"Sixth." After a pause, she relented. "Well... thanks."

The three efficiently carried the packages upstairs. When the elevator stopped on the sixth floor, Jenna took them back. "I can handle the rest."

She watched them head to the seventh floor before unlocking her door.

Upstairs, Ryan Roland's phone rang. He straightened instantly at the caller ID.

"Mr. Roscente."

"Did you see her?" The voice on the line was icy.

"Delivered Miss Roland's belongings to her doorstep," Ryan answered respectfully.

"Keep watching." Ethan ended the call without another word.
###Chapter 340

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains as Jenna Roland rose early to prepare breakfast. She placed golden fried eggs and steaming milk on the table before calling Ethan Roscente to join her.

After their meal, Jenna began organizing the clothes she planned to sell that day. As she dragged two heavy bags toward the door, she ran into Wyatt Roland, who had helped her yesterday.

"Good morning!" Jenna's eyes brightened. "Thank you again for your help."

Wyatt grinned. "No trouble at all."

"Are you here to see a friend?" Jenna asked curiously.

"Yeah, but he went out to buy groceries." Wyatt glanced at the bags on the floor. "Setting up your stall?"

Jenna nodded. "I need to catch the morning crowd."

"Let me carry these down for you," Wyatt offered. "I've got nothing else to do."

Jenna hesitated. "I couldn't impose..."

"Don't worry about it." Wyatt bent down and hoisted two bags effortlessly. "Grab another one, and I'll take them all down."

Jenna returned with two more bulging sacks, expecting Wyatt to make two trips. Instead, he lifted both in one hand and strode toward the elevator.

"My God!" Milo Roland's eyes widened. "That's insane strength!"

Jenna swallowed hard, equally stunned.

Ethan, standing nearby, narrowed his eyes, his expression darkening.

"I'll help," he said abruptly, striding past Jenna to grab the last bag before she could respond.

Jenna and Milo exchanged startled glances.

Inside the elevator, Wyatt and Ethan arranged the bags neatly in the corner. The confined space crackled with unspoken tension between the two tall men.

"Do you work out often?" Jenna asked, trying to ease the awkwardness. "These must weigh at least sixty pounds."

Wyatt chuckled. "I'm used to it. This is nothing."

Ethan stood behind Jenna, his gaze icy. Wyatt sensed the hostility and fell silent.

When the elevator reached the ground floor, Wyatt quickly unloaded the bags. Jenna noticed the veins standing out on Ethan's forearms as he carried two sacks.

"I'll get the bike," Jenna said, pulling Milo away.

By the time she returned with the e-tricycle, the men had already loaded everything. Wyatt muttered a hasty goodbye and retreated upstairs.

"See you later." Jenna started the engine and waved at Ethan.

He remained motionless, watching until the e-tricycle vanished around the corner. Morning light carved sharp shadows across his rigid profile.
###Chapter 341

At the corner of Taihe Road pedestrian street, Jenna Roland was setting up a food stall with her younger brother Milo Roland. Early summer sunlight filtered through the plane trees, casting dappled shadows on their stand.

Milo's phone suddenly vibrated.

He pulled it from his canvas bag. The screen displayed "Ryan Watson."

After taking the call by the sidewalk tree, Milo's expression darkened.

"Ryan's got acute appendicitis. The hospital needs six thousand for surgery." His grip tightened on the phone. "His parents aren't reachable. Can we lend him the money?"

Jenna kept working while scanning a QR code to transfer funds.

"Sent fifty-five hundred. That covers surgery and recovery expenses." She glanced up at her brother. "Tell him to focus on getting better. The money can wait."

Milo's eyes reddened slightly as he hailed a cab to the hospital.

With no customers at the moment, Jenna sat on a plastic stool playing mobile games. Occasionally she helped Tanya Hill, the neighboring accessories vendor, with customers. Morning slipped into noon.

At exactly eleven, Jenna headed to "Tasty Bites" on the corner.

The affordable eatery offered four dishes for ten dollars—a lunch staple for local vendors.

Carrying takeout boxes back, Jenna froze mid-step.

A sharply dressed figure stood by her stall.

Ethan Roscente had his back to her, phone pressed to his ear. His tailored suit accentuated broad shoulders tapering to a narrow waist.

As if sensing her gaze, he turned abruptly. Their eyes met, and Jenna's heartbeat stuttered.

"What are you doing here?" she asked, approaching.

Ethan pocketed his phone, gaze dropping to her takeout. "Client meeting nearby. Thought I'd stop by."

Jenna arched a brow. "Female client?"

His Adam's apple bobbed in silent confirmation.

"Had lunch yet?" She extended the containers. "Try some working-class cuisine."

Ethan's brow twitched almost imperceptibly at the flimsy plastic boxes. As CEO of HM Group, his usual haunts were Michelin-starred restaurants.

Today, he was just an ordinary department manager.

"Thanks." His fingers brushed hers as he accepted the food.

Jenna turned to fetch another meal, missing the intensity in his eyes as they followed her retreating form.
###Chapter 342

Jenna returned to find Ethan sitting behind their street stall, finishing his takeout lunch.

The plastic container was nearly empty.

She crouched beside him and sampled her own meal. "Not bad, right?"

Ethan glanced up. "Not as good as yours."

Her eyes curved into crescents. "Obviously. If I opened a restaurant, the whole block would line up." She propped her chin on her palm. "Too bad I'm chicken."

"Caution is a virtue," he said flatly.

"Exactly." Jenna shook her head. "Money's safest in the bank."

The corner of Ethan's mouth twitched. He didn't respond.

To her surprise, he'd cleaned his entire portion.

"You said it wasn't tasty," she teased, arching a brow.

"You paid for it." His gaze remained steady. "Waste is unacceptable."

Laughing, she collected the empty container. "Smart man. Every penny counts."

Suddenly clutching her stomach, she stood. "Watch the stall for me?"

Ethan gave a noncommittal hum without looking up.

The moment Jenna left, two girls stopped at their display.

"How much for this?" A floral-dressed girl held up a gray T-shirt.

Ethan pocketed his phone and approached.

Both girls flushed.

"Eighty," he said absently.

"Sold!" The girl pointed to a white dress. "And this?"

"Ninety."

She handed over the clothes. "Could you wrap them?"

Silently, Ethan bagged the items. "One-seventy."

After scanning the payment QR code, the girl dragged her friend back to browse more.

Soon, a growing crowd of young women gathered around.

"Can I add your WeChat?" A ponytailed girl asked boldly.

Jenna returned just in time to hear the question.

She couldn't suppress a giggle.

Ethan's expression darkened instantly. "Amusing?"

Jenna pressed her lips together. "Not at all."

For business's sake, she winked at the girls. "He's single, you know."

The crowd erupted in excitement.

Ethan's face turned thunderous.
###Chapter 343

The night market buzzed with neon lights and lively chatter. Ethan Roscente pushed through the crowd, his gaze instantly locking onto Jenna Roland surrounded by giggling girls.

"Hey handsome, can I get your number?" A redhead batted her lashes, leaning too close.

Jenna flashed her practiced customer-service smile. "Sure! My brother's actually single—"

Ethan's expression darkened. He strode forward and yanked Jenna against his side.

"She's my wife."

Silence crashed over the group.

Jenna's eyes widened, lips parting like a startled rabbit.

The girls froze, then erupted.

"Married? What a liar!"
"Playing games with people?"
"Disgusting!"

As insults flew, the crowd dispersed. Jenna paled, stealing a glance at Ethan.

His chiseled face was stormy, eyes brewing danger.

"Why...why'd you say that?" She shrank back, voice fading.

Ethan caged her against the stall wall, forearm braced beside her head. His breath scorched her cheek.

"I don't have a girlfriend?" The low threat vibrated between them.

She ducked her chin. "It's just business..."

"So you tell them I'm single?" His lids lowered to slits.

"Well...you don't have a girlfriend." Her mutter barely carried. "We're married..."

"Jenna!" His jaw clenched audibly.

Nearby vendors perked up, ears practically twitching.

She twisted her fingers. "It's not like you wanted this marriage anyway."

A vein throbbed at Ethan's temple. His fist slammed into the wall beside her head.

"Last warning." His whisper seared her ear. "Remember your place."

Heat flooded Jenna's face. She turned away stubbornly, only to hear his scoff as he stalked off.

The night breeze carried away his lingering warmth. Watching his retreating figure, her pulse stuttered inexplicably.
###Chapter 344

"Did you remember what I said?" Ethan's voice was icy, his gaze sharp.

Jenna pressed her lips together and nodded reluctantly. "I did."

Ethan scoffed and strode away without another word.

She watched his retreating figure, fingers tangling in her hair in confusion.

What was his problem?

He'd been forced into this marriage by Grandma Blanche. He clearly didn't like her. So why did he care so much about her response?

Jenna rolled her eyes, her expression dismissive.

Only when Ethan's taxi disappeared around the corner did she return to her stall.

Tanya immediately scooted closer, eyes bright with excitement. "Jenna, was that really your husband?"

"Technically," Jenna replied flatly.

"What do you mean 'technically'?" Tanya frowned.

Jenna looked up. "We're married on paper. No feelings involved."

Tanya stood abruptly. "Legally, you're husband and wife. And he's gorgeous! He even treats you well. Why not give it a real shot?"

"Treats me well?" Jenna's brows knitted together.

"He helped you sell clothes earlier. Then he publicly announced your marriage with his arm around you. Would he go that far if he didn't like you?"

Jenna froze.

Tanya's words triggered a memory—waking up that morning to find Ethan lying beside her.

Had that been... intentional?

And just now, when she'd said Ethan didn't have a girlfriend, he'd clearly been angry.

A shiver ran down Jenna's spine.

Oh god. Could Ethan actually have feelings for her?

Tanya nudged her. "Hey, what's with the spaced-out look?"

"Why would he like me?" The words tumbled out before Jenna could stop them.

Tanya laughed. "You're beautiful and capable. Who wouldn't fall for you? Too bad you're already taken."

"Too bad?" Jenna arched an eyebrow.

Tanya sighed. "I was going to introduce you to my son. Now that's off the table. Though honestly, compared to your husband, my boy wouldn't stand a chance."

Jenna bit back a laugh.

If they hadn't been in public, she would've doubled over with laughter.
###Chapter 345

Jenna Roland's smile faded as her gaze settled on Tanya Hill. "How old is your son this year?"

Tanya sat back on the small stool. "Twenty-eight. He writes code at an internet company."

Jenna's lips curved slightly. "Being a programmer is good—stable income. He'll definitely find a nice girl someday."

"Good? He stays up all night and loses hair!" Tanya waved her hands dismissively. "Don't even mention him. Gives me a headache."

"Alright."

Jenna had just pulled out her phone to call Milo Roland about Ryan Watson's condition when three young girls walked into the shop to browse clothes.

After seeing the customers out, Jenna picked up her phone again—only for the screen to light up with an incoming call from Grandma Blanche.

Her brow furrowed as she answered. "Grandma."

Blanche's gentle voice came through. "Jenna, dear. Do you have a moment? There's something I'd like to discuss."

"Go ahead."

"Ethan's cousin was released from prison yesterday. His uncle wants Ethan to arrange a position for him at the company. Could you mention it to him?"

Jenna's frown deepened. "Grandma, you're his grandmother. Wouldn't it be more appropriate for you to ask?"

"Ah, but Ethan only listens to you now." Blanche sighed. "Of course, if it's inconvenient, just forget it."

Jenna knew this wasn't a request—it was an obligation. That "if it's inconvenient" was nothing but politeness.

"What if he refuses?"

"He'll agree if you ask."

The certainty in Blanche's tone left no room for refusal. Jenna took a deep breath. "Fine. I'll try."

After hanging up, she massaged her temples. At least she'd cut ties with her own relatives. If they knew Ethan was a director at HM Group, every distant aunt and cousin would be knocking down her door.

Sometimes, having no family was a blessing.

......

At 7:30 p.m., Jenna returned home to find Ethan still absent.

She organized the day's inventory before heading to the kitchen. Though she'd had snacks in the afternoon, she decided to prepare a simple meal since Milo would be joining them.

The fridge still had fresh vegetables. Jenna settled on scrambled eggs with tomatoes, stir-fried water spinach, and a simple cabbage and egg drop soup.

Just as she set the dishes on the table, Milo walked in.

"How's Ryan?" Jenna handed him a bowl of rice.

Milo accepted it. "The surgery went well. Otherwise, I wouldn't be back."

"Who's taking care of him at the hospital now?" Jenna served herself some water spinach.

"Me." Milo shoveled rice into his mouth. "I have to go back after this."
###Chapter 346

Ryan Watson's fingers trembled slightly as he took the e-bike keys. Jenna Roland felt a pang of pity watching him.

"Ride safely."

Milo Roland wolfed down his meal and grabbed his keys.

"See you later, sis!"

Jenna called after her brother's retreating figure. "Slow down!"

After washing the dishes, Jenna took a hot shower. When she stepped out, the wall clock showed 9:30 PM.

She frowned at her phone screen, hovering her finger over Ethan Roscente's contact. Finally, she lowered her hand.

"He'll just get angry if I call this late."

A familiar black profile picture suddenly caught her eye in the WhatsApp contacts. Jenna's pupils contracted, her finger freezing mid-air.

"Strange... Didn't he delete me?"

She opened the chat window and typed after some hesitation: "When are you coming back?"

Two minutes passed with no response. Jenna headed to the bedroom, completely missing the incoming call notification flashing on the sofa.

Just as she finished her skincare routine, she noticed Gavin Valentine's missed call. This reserved man never called without reason.

The moment she answered, Gavin's urgent voice came through: "Ms. Roland, why didn't you pick up?"

"I was busy. What's wrong?"

"Ethan's drunk at Studio 54! If I hadn't run into him—"

Jenna's chest tightened. "Which room?"

"VIP 888. Don't mention my call!"

"Can't you take him home?"

"My clients are still here!" Gavin hung up abruptly.

Jenna stared at the darkened screen, nails digging into her palms. Studio 54—the place she never wanted to set foot in again.
###Chapter 347

Jenna Roland stepped into Studio 54, her heels clicking against the marble floor.

The glow of crystal chandeliers cascaded over her, illuminating her delicate profile.

Staff members nodded respectfully as she passed.

"Good evening, Ms. Roland."

"You look stunning tonight, Ms. Roland."

She acknowledged them with a slight tilt of her head and headed straight for VIP Room 888.

"Jenna?"

Tristan Ashcroft's voice came from the side.

She paused mid-step and turned to face the impeccably suited club owner.

"Boss."

Tristan closed the distance between them, lowering his voice. "What are you doing here?"

"Gavin said Ethan was drunk. I came to take him home."

Understanding flickered in Tristan's eyes.

He'd always known the true nature of their marriage.

"Bad timing."

Jenna's brows drew together. "Why?"

"Lucien Valois is upstairs." His expression darkened. "If he sees you, there'll be trouble."

Her face paled.

She pushed open the private room door without hesitation.

The opulent space held only one occupant.

Ethan Roscente's pale complexion stood in stark contrast against his black dress shirt.

Slumped on the sofa, his tie hung loose. Unnatural flush colored his cheeks.

Jenna hurried forward.

"Ethan?"

He lifted his head slowly, gaze unfocused.

As he tried to stand, his legs gave way, sending him crashing toward her.

Instinctively, she caught him.

His scorching body weight pressed against hers.

The pungent scent of alcohol assaulted her senses.

"Ethan! Get up!"

His breath fanned across her neck.

Eyes half-lidded, he suddenly smiled—soft, tender.

"Yvonne..."

Jenna froze.

The name stabbed through her heart like a blade.

She shoved him away violently.

Ethan hit the floor with a heavy thud.

Without looking back, she fled the room.

The impact jolted him awake.

The lingering scent of roses clung to his fingertips.

When he looked up, all he caught was a glimpse of retreating figure through the closing door.

Ethan's expression contorted.

He scrambled to his feet, but only heard the fading click of heels.

The door still swayed slightly.

Rubbing his temples, he frowned.

What had he just said?
###Chapter 348

The sudden ringtone shattered the silence.

He struggled to rise from the couch, only to collapse back onto it. Gritting his teeth, he finally grabbed the phone.

Gavin Valentine's name flashed on the screen.

He answered the call.

......

Jenna Roland had just reached the stairwell when she nearly collided with Stella Laurent ascending the steps.

"Jenna?" Stella's eyes widened in surprise. "What are you doing here?"

Jenna quickly schooled her expression, forcing a smile. "Just passing through. Don't mind me."

Stella immediately noticed her bloodshot eyes and trembling voice.

"What happened?" Stella reached for her hand.

Jenna pulled away. "Not now."

As she turned, she spotted Ethan Roscente and Gavin descending the stairs.

The chandelier light illuminated Ethan's face with cruel clarity. That intimate nickname echoed in her ears again.

"I'll call you tomorrow." Jenna shook off Stella's grip and fled down the stairs without looking back.

Stella stared after her retreating figure, brow furrowed.

Ethan leaned heavily against Gavin, clearly intoxicated.

"What did she say?" Gavin's voice was dark.

Stella shook her head. "She wouldn't tell me."

Gavin didn't press further, guiding Ethan away.

Stella climbed the stairs and pushed open the door to VIP Room 308.

Lucien Valois lounged at the center of the leather sofa, his pink silk shirt unbuttoned at the collar.

Three black-suited bodyguards stood sentry around the room.

"Mr. Valois." Stella stopped at a respectful distance.

Lucien swirled his whiskey, sharp eyes assessing her. "I thought you and Jenna were close friends."

Stella instantly understood his implication.

"We... haven't spoken recently." Her voice was barely above a whisper.

Lucien chuckled and downed the remaining liquor in one swallow.
###Chapter 349

Stella clenched her fists so tightly her nails dug into her palms. The deference in her eyes had vanished, replaced by seething hatred.

"Mr. Valois, I just want to know where my sister is." Her voice trembled, each word forced through gritted teeth.

Seven days. Seven days without a single trace of Sylvia. Stella had called her sister's phone until it went dead. She'd questioned every friend, followed every lead—nothing.

Her first suspects were Lucien Valois and his wife Yvonne.

After all, Sylvia had been Lucien's mistress for years. She'd even sabotaged his affair with Jenna. If Yvonne discovered her husband's infidelity, she wouldn't let it slide.

Stella had turned the city upside down searching for Lucien. Now that she'd cornered him, she wouldn't back down.

"What did you say?" Lucien's brow furrowed.

"Stop pretending!" Stella's voice cracked like a whip. "Did you kill my sister?"

Her eyes burned with unshed tears. Sylvia was her only family. For her, Stella would risk everything.

Lucien's expression darkened. "I didn't kill her."

"Then was it your wife?" Stella advanced on him.

After a weighted pause, Lucien said, "I'll look into it."

He handed her his business card. Stella dialed the number on the spot to verify it before leaving.

The moment she was gone, Lucien summoned his bodyguard.

"Talk." His voice could freeze hell. "What do you know?"

The bodyguard kept his head bowed, barely daring to breathe.
###Chapter 350

The bodyguard trembled violently, nearly collapsing to his knees.

"Madam Yvonne had Miss Sylvia kidnapped. Her condition is unknown." His voice shook with fear.

Lucien Valois slammed his glass down, pressing his knuckles against his temple.

Yvonne had actually targeted Sylvia.

He knew his wife's temperament too well. Sylvia's chances of survival were slim.

His slender fingers picked up a cigarette. The bodyguard immediately offered a light.

Amid the swirling smoke, Lucien narrowed his eyes.

"Find her. I want to see her alive or dead."

The bodyguard bowed and retreated.

......

Jenna Roland stood by the roadside hailing a cab.

She had intended to go to a hotel, but all her belongings were still at Beverly Hills.

In the end, she took a taxi home.

The moment she entered, she grabbed her charger to leave again.

Then she hesitated. Walking out like this would be irresponsible.

Grandma Blanche had been so kind to her. She couldn't betray the old lady's goodwill.

Jenna sighed, dropping her bag before heading to shower.

She had just towel-dried her hair when the door clicked open.

Gavin Valentine supported a heavily intoxicated Ethan Roscente at the threshold.

"Mr. Valentine." Jenna gave a curt nod, turning toward her room.

Gavin's brow furrowed.

He guided Ethan onto the sofa.

"Water." Ethan loosened his tie, his voice hoarse.

Tonight's excessive drinking stemmed entirely from the day's events.

He'd vomited twice during the ride, only now regaining slight sobriety.

Gavin handed him a glass, unable to contain his question. "What happened between you two?"

Ethan lit a cigarette, taking a deep drag.

He wished he knew the reason too.

"No idea."

Gavin nearly leapt up.

"You must've done something! She used to be so polite to you!"
###Chapter 351

Ethan Roscente's cigarette burned halfway between his fingers. He lifted his gaze to Gavin Valentine, his voice low. "All I remember is lying on the floor and Jenna Roland slamming the door on her way out. Everything before that is a blank."

Gavin's eyes widened in disbelief.

What kind of excuse was this? A drunken blackout? But Ethan had been conscious. How could he not remember anything?

Wait—Ethan said he fell. Did he trip on his own, or did Jenna push him?

If it was the latter, something must have happened to provoke Jenna's fury. Or... had Ethan crossed a line while drunk?

Either scenario would explain Jenna's current attitude.

Gavin sighed and pulled a cigarette from Ethan's pack.

Leaning back into the leather sofa, he took a deep drag and exhaled a slow stream of smoke. "Man, you're in deep trouble."

Ethan remained silent, mechanically repeating the motion of smoking.

Gavin stubbed out his cigarette and turned to him. "Want me to test the waters for you?"

"Fine."

The immediate answer nearly made Gavin choke on his smoke.

This guy really had no shame.

Whatever. He was family. Gavin resigned himself and stood. "Stay out of sight. I'll call Jenna out to talk. I can't just barge into your bedroom—"

Before he could finish, Ethan was already striding toward the door.

Gavin's lips twitched as he watched him leave, then turned toward the master bedroom.

"Jenna, it's Gavin," he said softly, knocking. "Can we talk?"

Inside the bedroom, Jenna had just lain down when the knock came.

She opened the door, confirming Ethan wasn't in the living room before asking coldly, "What do you want, Mr. Valentine?"

"Let's talk in the living room." Gavin motioned for her to follow.

Once seated, he cut straight to the point. "What happened between you and Ethan at the club's private room?"

Jenna's brows furrowed slightly. "Why do you ask?"

"You've been ignoring him since you got back, and the pickup mission was a failure. I need to know why."

"Nothing happened." Jenna met his gaze, her expression eerily calm, but an icy aura radiated from her.

Gavin gave a wry smile. "You really expect me to believe that?"

Jenna pressed her lips together. "He lost his balance and fell on me. That's all."

Gavin rubbed his forehead.

Even a three-year-old wouldn't buy that flimsy excuse.

"Jenna, we're adults. You don't have to tell him, but you can tell me the truth."

How could she admit that Ethan had called another woman's name while kissing her? The humiliation was too much to voice.

"Mr. Valentine, Ethan has done so much for me. No matter what happened, I have no right to be angry. Let him come back and rest. I'm going to sleep."

Without waiting for a response, Jenna stood and retreated to her room.

Gavin shook his head at the closed door. It seemed this marital crisis would have to be resolved by the two of them alone.
###Chapter 352

Gavin Valentine rose and walked to the door, turning the handle.

Ethan Roscente stood outside with a stormy expression.

"She didn't say anything." Gavin shrugged. "Your call."

He patted Ethan's shoulder and stepped past him.

Ethan entered silently, closing the door behind him.

No light seeped from beneath the bedroom door.

Pushing it open gently, he saw Jenna Roland already lying on the floor bedding, illuminated by the hallway light.

Ethan stood over her, gaze fixed on her curled form.

Two minutes passed before he spoke. "Take the bed. I'll sleep in the living room."

Only the hum of the air conditioner filled the silence.

"About the club... I'm sorry." Ethan drew a deep breath. "I apologize."

Jenna remained motionless, her back to him.

His fists clenched.

Did he really think a simple apology could make up for calling her the wrong name?

He turned and left, shutting the door quietly behind him.

Jenna opened her eyes, staring at the dark wall.

Selective amnesia?

He'd been perfectly lucid at the time. Now he played dumb.

She rolled over as her phone screen lit up.

Grandma Blanche's caller ID flashed.

"Grandma." Jenna answered.

"Jenna dear, are you asleep?" Concern laced the older woman's voice.

"About to." Jenna kept her voice soft.

"Did you mention what we discussed earlier to Ethan?"

Jenna studied the shadows on the ceiling.

"Forgot. I'll tell him tomorrow."

"Is Ethan asleep?"

"Probably." Jenna hedged.

"Aren't you sharing a bed?" Grandma Blanche sounded suspicious.

Jenna bit her lip.

"He's facing away. Let me check."

She pretended to look, pausing before saying, "He's asleep."

"Well then—"

The bedroom door swung open, cutting her off.

"Jenna, did you wash my towel?" Ethan's voice carried clearly.

Jenna froze.

"Ethan's still awake?" Grandma Blanche pounced.

Jenna massaged her temples.

The woman had bat-like hearing.

"Sorry Grandma, he's actually not asleep."

"Perfect timing. Ask him now." Grandma Blanche urged. "Your uncle Victor's whole family is waiting for an answer."
###Chapter 353

Jenna Roland was fuming, in no mood to deal with Ethan Roscente.

Grandma Blanche's call had put her in an impossible position.

Refusing the old lady's request would only raise suspicions.

She took a deep breath and reluctantly agreed, "Understood, Grandma. I'll call you back tomorrow."

After hanging up, she marched over to Ethan with a frosty expression. "Your grandmother wants you to arrange a job for your uncle's son."

Without another word, she turned on her heel, determined to avoid any mention of the towel incident.

Ethan frowned. "Did you wash the towel?"

"Still wet." Jenna kept her back to him, willing him to leave.

Instead, he flicked on the light and dragged a chair beside her floor bedding.

"Do you know what time it is?" Jenna sat up angrily.

Ethan met her gaze directly. "What exactly happened at Studio 54 that night?"

"Stop pretending to have amnesia." Jenna scoffed. "You know damn well what you did."

"I was too drunk to remember."

"Being drunk doesn't excuse anything." Her voice turned sharp.

Ethan remained calm. "I don't want misunderstandings between us."

Jenna arched an eyebrow. "So you're not leaving until I talk?"

"Correct." His tone brooked no argument.

"Ethan," Jenna sneered, "we both know why we got married. Stop acting like you care."

His fists clenched briefly before relaxing.

"You promised not to mention divorce," he said darkly.

Jenna faltered. "I did say that."

"Then we're still husband and wife." Ethan softened his tone. "We should communicate."

She bit her lower lip before finally asking, "Who is Yvonne Sherwood?"
###Chapter 354

Ethan's pupils constricted sharply.

He had imagined countless questions Jenna might throw at him, but never anticipated she'd bring up that long-buried name.

"I said it at the club?" His voice tightened.

Jenna pressed her lips together and nodded, hurt flashing in her eyes.

At the moment their lips were about to meet, he'd called out someone else's name. The realization made her chest constrict.

"Yvonne was my college girlfriend." Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed. "We broke up five years ago. She lives abroad now. We've had no contact since."

He paused. "After we got married, I didn't even think about her."

Jenna turned her face away, nails digging unconsciously into her palms.

"Forgotten when sober, remembered when drunk." Her voice trembled. "If you can't let go, why did you involve me?"

Ethan suddenly seized her wrist.

"I was drunk that night." His knuckles whitened. "I apologize. Can we forget this happened?"

Jenna wrenched free and walked to the window, taking deep breaths.

The glass reflected her red-rimmed eyes.

"Let's divorce." She turned back with forced calm. "Go find her. Don't waste each other's time."

"Never!"

His raised voice startled her.

Ethan's eyes were bloodshot, jaw clenched tight, veins bulging on his hands.

"Five years is enough to forget anyone." Each word sounded ground between teeth. "That night was a moment of weakness, but I swear she means nothing to me now!"

Jenna froze at his intensity.

Suddenly Ethan dropped to one knee, grasping her cold hands.

"At first I resented this marriage." He gazed up, dark eyes turbulent. "But you changed that."

His thumb gently stroked her knuckles.

"You're ridiculously kind, stubbornly endearing." His voice softened. "Even the way you pout when upset makes me unable to look away."

Jenna's heart skipped.

"Don't leave." He pressed her palm against his chest. "There's only you here now."

Beneath her fingers, his heartbeat raced wildly.

Jenna yanked her hand back, ears burning. She'd thought this marriage was purely transactional—never expecting a confession.

Worse, her own pounding heart betrayed her true feelings.

"I—I need water."

As she fled, she missed the dark glint in Ethan's eyes.
###Chapter 355

Ethan's fingers lightly covered Jenna's hand as he noticed her hesitation.

His gaze burned with intensity. His voice was deep and firm. "Give me a chance. If I ever disappoint you, you can leave anytime."

Jenna's lashes fluttered. Memories of the past few months flashed through her mind.

He had brought her warm midnight snacks during overtime work. He had stayed by her side when she caught a cold. He remembered every little habit of hers.

Compared to starting over with a stranger, this man who knew her so well seemed far more trustworthy.

"Okay," she finally nodded, then raised a warning finger. "But if you dare lie to me—"

Ethan's eyes lit up with joy before she could finish. He leaned in eagerly. "You're saying yes?"

"We already signed the marriage certificate. Why ask now?" Jenna turned her face away, the tips of her ears turning pink.

"Of course it matters." Ethan suddenly lowered his voice, his warm breath brushing her ear. "This way, I can rightfully—"

The room plunged into darkness before he could finish.

Before Jenna could react, she felt herself being lifted into the air.

"Ethan!" She gasped, pounding his shoulders. "Put me down!"

Effortlessly, he placed her on the bed, caging her beneath his arms. Amusement laced his voice. "It's not our first time sharing a bed. Why so nervous?"

"You've been drinking!" Jenna pushed against him. "I'm sleeping on the couch!"

Ethan suddenly released her and walked toward the closet.

Just as Jenna thought she'd escaped, he scooped her up again.

"If you don't want the bed," he strode toward the prepared floor bedding, "then we'll sleep here together."

Jenna glared at him, indignant. "I meant I don't want to sleep with you!"

Ethan had already settled down, pulling her firmly into his embrace.

"Don't move," he murmured, resting his chin atop her head. "I promise I'll just sleep."

Jenna tensed to struggle, but then heard his muffled voice. "I'm really exhausted today."

Her heart softened inexplicably, and she stilled.

"No crossing the line," she warned gruffly, yet subtly nestled closer.

In the darkness, Ethan's lips curled in triumph.

He had planned an elaborate confession, but the unexpected had forced his hand. Though rushed, holding her like this was more than enough.
###Chapter 356

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Jenna Roland blinked awake.

The space beside her was empty.

She grabbed her phone. The 8:30 alarm had long since passed.

"Oh no!" She bolted upright, scanning the room for Ethan Roscente.

After locking the door and dressing quickly, she pushed open the bedroom door. A strange scent hit her nostrils.

Following the smell to the kitchen, she froze.

Ethan stood at the stove wearing an apron.

"You're... cooking noodles?" She rubbed her eyes in disbelief.

"Almost done," he replied without turning. "Go wash up."

Jenna lingered, watching his clumsy movements. She knew he despised noodle dishes.

While brushing her teeth, she puzzled over it—until she saw the steaming bowl of plain noodle soup on the table.

"When did you learn this?" She sniffed suspiciously.

Ethan handed her chopsticks, his gaze unusually soft. "Followed a tutorial. Try it."

She took a tentative bite and nearly spat it out. The broth tasted like pure salt.

"Well?" Ethan watched expectantly.

Jenna forced a swallow. "It's... okay."

He snatched the chopsticks and tasted it himself, immediately grimacing. "Don't eat this. It's inedible."

His first cooking attempt ended in failure.
###Chapter 357

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains.

Jenna Roland stared at the steaming bowl of noodles before her. She hesitated before taking a bite. The overwhelming saltiness exploded on her tongue, but she forced herself not to grimace.

"How is it?" Ethan Roscente watched her expectantly.

"Not bad." Jenna managed a tight smile before gulping down water.

Ethan tasted it himself and immediately frowned. "It's inedible."

He set down his chopsticks, voice low. "Let's go out for breakfast."

Seeing his dejected expression, Jenna softened. "No need. I'll cook."

In the kitchen, Jenna boiled water with practiced ease. Ethan lingered in the doorway, watching her move.

Last night's confession still echoed between them. He'd wanted to express his feelings through this meal, but failed spectacularly.

"I'll do the dishes." Ethan took the empty bowl, his fingers accidentally brushing against Jenna's. They both flinched away.

The new batch of noodles smelled heavenly. Jenna had added homemade chili paste, crimson oil swirling on the surface.

The phone rang abruptly.

"Grandma." Jenna answered.

"Jenna, what did Ethan say about that matter?" Grandma Blanche's voice crackled through the receiver.

Jenna glanced at Ethan. "He hasn't given an answer yet."

"Ask him now!" Grandma Blanche insisted.

Jenna set down her chopsticks. "Ethan, about finding your cousin a job..."

Ethan's eyes turned glacial. "He's an ex-con. You know that, right?"

"Grandma says he's reformed."

"He raped and murdered a woman." Ethan enunciated each word. "Do you really think he belongs in my company?"

Jenna gasped. "It was that serious?"

Grandma Blanche's cough sounded through the phone. Jenna suddenly remembered the ongoing call and forced an awkward laugh.

"Give him the phone." Grandma Blanche commanded.

Ethan took it, his expression darkening. "No."

"He's paid his debt to society!" Grandma Blanche raised her voice. "Can't you do this for your grandmother?"

"If your family hadn't bribed officials, he'd be executed by now." Ethan's laugh was icy.

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Ethan, he's still your blood relative. Just give him any position, even as charity..."

Ethan ended the call.
###Chapter 358

Ethan ended the call abruptly and tossed the phone back to Jenna.

"Next time Grandma Blanche calls you, just hang up."

Jenna caught the phone and nodded silently.

After finishing their noodles, Ethan cleared the dishes. Once done, he grabbed several bags of clothes and headed downstairs.

The hallway was eerily quiet this time—no sign of Wyatt and his crew.

Jenna swung her leg over the e-tricycle and tilted her chin at him. "Need a ride to work?"

Ethan eyed the rickety vehicle, imagining his employees spotting him on it. He shook his head decisively.

"No thanks. Be careful on the road."

Jenna didn’t press further. She twisted the throttle and sped off toward Mall of America.

She had just set up her stall when her phone buzzed. A message from Milo said he’d be staying at the hospital to look after Ryan Watson.

Jenna replied understandingly: "Take care of yourself. Don’t forget to eat."

The moment she hit send, Stella’s call came through.

"Aren’t you supposed to be napping right now?" Jenna asked, surprised.

"Can’t sleep because of my sister," Stella rasped. "By the way, why were you at Studio 54 last night?"

"It’s a long story." Jenna deflected. "What happened to Sylvia?"

"She’s missing." Stella’s voice trembled. "Her phone’s dead. The police won’t help. It’s been days."

Jenna’s fingers jerked, nearly dropping her phone. "How?"

"It’s Lucien Valois—I know it!" Stella hissed. "But last night he promised to help find her..."

A cold weight settled in Jenna’s chest. If even the police couldn’t locate Sylvia, the odds were grim.

"Did you check with her friends?"

"Every single one." Stella suddenly broke into sobs. "Jenna… she’s all I have left."

Muffled crying filled the line. Jenna gripped her phone, at a loss for words.
###Chapter 359

"Could Lucien Valois' wife have discovered your sister's affair with him and had her kidnapped?"

"I'm not sure... But his wife is ruthless. If she found out, she'd never let my sister go!"

"Then Lucien needs to confront his wife."

"What if she denies it?"

"With solid evidence, she won't have a choice. Let me help you investigate."

"Jenna... I need to ask you for a favor."

"What is it?"

"I barely know Lucien. He wouldn't question his wife for me. But he has feelings for you... Could you talk to him?"

Jenna's grip on her phone tightened.

Lucien did desire her, but Stella had warned her to stay away from that dangerous man.

Now she was supposed to walk right into his arms?

She'd barely escaped that night. Who knew what would happen if she saw him again?

That madman was capable of anything.

"Jenna... You don't want to help me, do you?" Stella's voice trembled with disappointment. "It's okay. I'll wait for the police."

"Let me make some inquiries first. If we still can't find her, I'll go to Lucien. Deal?"

"Okay. Don't force yourself. I know this is too much to ask..."

Stella choked back a sob.

She understood Lucien's danger better than anyone. She'd never risk Jenna's safety unless desperate.

"Don't say that. Your sister protected me at the club. If she hadn't stalled him, Lucien would've..."

Jenna shuddered at the memory.

"Call me immediately if you hear anything."

After hanging up, Jenna took a deep breath and dialed Ethan.

"Ethan, I need your help. It's urgent."

"Speak."

"My friend's sister is missing. The police have no leads. She used to be Lucien Valois' mistress. I suspect—"

"How is this your concern?"

Ethan's voice turned icy.

"She's my closest friend. At the club, her sister bought me time to escape..."

Jenna's voice shook. "She took a beating from Lucien to save me. Now she's vanished. I can't abandon her."

"Name."

"Sylvia Savigny."

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"I'll have someone look into it."

Ethan pressed the intercom. His assistant Lucas hurried in.

"Find a woman named Sylvia Savigny. Former mistress of Lucien Valois."

"Right away, Mr. Roscente."

As Lucas turned to leave, he caught Ethan's stormy expression and quickened his pace.
###Chapter 360

The moment Lucas left the office, Ethan's phone screen lit up.

He glanced at the caller ID—Grandpa Harrison's private number.

"Grandpa." Ethan answered the call.

A hoarse voice came through the line. "Ethan, your grandmother says you refused to give Shawn a position?"

Ethan pulled a cigarette from the pack and lit it, taking a deep drag. "You know what kind of man he is."

Shawn had been convicted of rape and murder.

His cousin was a notorious womanizer, preying on innocent women like a dog in heat.

Ethan would never allow such scum in his company.

"Your uncle can't control him." Grandpa Harrison sighed. "Only you can keep him in line."

It was true. Shawn dared to raise a hand against his own father, but he never crossed Ethan.

"He's still a Roscente." The old man's voice grew solemn. "Will you just stand by and watch him get the death penalty?"

Ethan exhaled a slow stream of smoke.

His grandfather rarely intervened like this.

"Fine." Ethan stubbed out the cigarette. "But if he lays a finger on any female employee, I won't hold back."

"Do as you see fit!"

After hanging up, Ethan pressed the intercom. "Assign Shawn to security."

"Understood." Lucas nodded and left.

......

At seven in the evening, Jenna packed up her stall and rode her e-tricycle back to the apartment complex.

Two familiar figures stood at the entrance.

"What a coincidence." Jenna hopped off the bike.

Wyatt stepped forward. "Finished for the day, Ms. Roland?"

"Business was good." She pointed to the cargo box. "Only three bags left."

Xavier crushed his cigarette underfoot. "Let us help you carry them."

Before Jenna could decline, they had already unloaded the goods with practiced efficiency.

"Last time it was four bags?" Wyatt hefted one.

Jenna's eyes curved into crescents. "Sold one today."
###Chapter 361

"Business is good today!" Wyatt Roland smiled as he eyed the merchandise on the e-tricycle. "Xavier and I can help carry these upstairs for you."

"Thanks!" Jenna Roland replied cheerfully, hopping onto the vehicle to park it.

When she returned, the two men had already disappeared from the apartment entrance.

The elevator doors opened to reveal three neatly stacked packages waiting outside her door. Jenna exhaled in relief, amused by her own paranoia.

After storing the clothes inside, she dialed Ethan Roscente. "Just got home. Are you coming back for dinner?"

Receiving a negative answer, she moved to the kitchen to prepare noodles.

The clink of cutlery had just ceased when the front door lock turned. Ethan entered holding a bouquet of sunflowers, their golden petals still glistening with water droplets.

"Sunflowers again?" Jenna arched an eyebrow.

"They looked fresh at the florist," he replied, reaching for a vase. "I'll change the water."

She leaned against the kitchen doorway as he deftly trimmed the stems. "Any luck finding Sylvia?"

"Not yet." His fingers never paused. "Don't get your hopes up."

After arranging the flowers, Ethan headed straight for the bedroom. Jenna followed after cleaning up, only to find him unbuttoning his dress shirt.

"Ah!" She spun around, hands covering her eyes. "What are you doing undressing suddenly?"

"Changing clothes." Amusement colored his voice. "What else?"

"Can't you use the bathroom?" Her ears burned crimson.

Warmth pressed against her back. Ethan had closed the distance without sound, his hands settling on her shoulders.

"Help! Pervert!" Jenna shrieked, attempting to flee, but his arms caged her effortlessly.

"Who's the pervert?" His tone turned dangerous.

"The one stripping naked!" She kept her eyes squeezed shut.

Her palm was suddenly guided against firm, heated skin. Ethan chuckled darkly. "Want to feel?"

Fingertips encountered defined ridges. Jenna peeked through one eyelid.

Pale skin stretched over eight sculpted abdominal muscles, his chest carved with perfect definition. Her hands flew to her mouth. "You actually have muscles?"

The biceps flexing as he moved explained how he'd carried her heavy packages with ease. Against her will, Jenna's gaze lingered for another appreciative sweep.
###Chapter 362

"Of course." Ethan's lips curved slightly, his gaze burning into her. "Satisfied?"

"It's...acceptable." Jenna hastily withdrew her hand, her cheeks hot enough to fry an egg.

"As long as you like it."

"......"

Her ears turned crimson.

Ethan chuckled lowly. "Shy now?"

Jenna shot him a glare and turned to flee.

This time, he didn't stop her.

Casually grabbing his shirt, he strode bare-chested toward the bathroom.

Collapsing on the couch, Jenna only exhaled when she heard the shower running.

The old Ethan would never have been this shameless. Why was he suddenly showing off his muscles today?

Unless...

He planned to share the bed tonight?

What if he tried something?

She'd never even held a man's hand before.

What would...that even feel like?

Jenna buried her burning face in her hands.

No! If Ethan really wanted to do something, she couldn't just play dumb.

Her phone vibrated.

Stella had sent a string of exclamation marks.

"You've been married this long and still haven't slept together?!"

"Separate rooms." Jenna bit her lip as she typed. "But tonight he might..."

"Wow~" came Stella's instant reply. "I've got tutorial videos."

Jenna nearly dropped her phone.

"You're insane!"

"Stop pretending to be innocent." Stella sent a link. "Study up to take control."

The shower stopped.

Like a thief, Jenna slipped onto the balcony, finger trembling over the link.

If Ethan caught her...
###Chapter 363

Jenna Roland was completely absorbed in her phone screen, oblivious to Ethan Roscente's presence outside the floor-to-ceiling window.

Ethan arched an eyebrow as he observed Jenna hiding in the corner of the balcony, surprise flickering in his eyes.

He hadn't expected to stumble upon this scene.

His slender fingers tapped lightly on the glass twice.

Jenna jerked her head up, meeting Ethan's amused gaze. Her face instantly flushed crimson. Fumbling, she locked her phone with trembling fingers.

"When...when did you get here?" Her voice was tight, her heart pounding so violently it threatened to leap from her chest.

Ethan pushed open the door and pulled her into the living room. He braced one hand against the glass beside her ear, trapping her in the small space.

Jenna's face burned even hotter, the tips of her ears turning pink.

"Let me go," she protested weakly, her eyes darting everywhere but at him.

Ethan chuckled lowly. "So this is what you like watching?"

"No!" Jenna shook her head frantically. "Stella sent it! I didn't even want to look!"

"Since when do you hide to chat with friends?" His lips curved meaningfully. "It's okay to admit it."

Jenna wished the ground would swallow her whole. She'd specifically waited until Ethan was showering to sneak onto the balcony—how had he still caught her?

This was beyond embarrassing.

Ethan released his hold, only to slide an arm around her shoulders and steer her inside. "Good things should be shared."

Jenna froze, her entire face scorching.

"I deleted it!" She glared at him indignantly. "If you want to see it, find it yourself."

Ethan pretended to reach for her phone. "Really deleted?"

Jenna tried to bolt, but Ethan yanked her back against his chest. She bit her lower lip in frustration—if she'd known this would happen, she never would've clicked that link.

This was all Stella's fault!

Ethan tilted her chin up, mischief dancing in his eyes. "Two choices: either we watch it together now, or...I'll test your learning progress tonight."

"What?" Jenna's eyes widened.

Ethan dropped a kiss on her forehead and turned toward the bedroom. "Prepare well."

Jenna stood rooted to the spot, stomping her foot in anger.

That bastard!

Fuming, she deleted the URL from her phone and decided she'd be sleeping on the couch tonight.
###Chapter 364

Jenna Roland watched the darkening sky outside her window, absently swiping her phone screen. A brilliant idea suddenly struck her.

"Hey, Milo?" She dialed her younger brother's number. "Are you coming home tonight?"

When Milo said he was staying at a friend's place, Jenna's eyes lit up. She sprang from the couch and dashed into his room in three quick strides.

The lock clicked shut behind her. Jenna exhaled in relief. Finally, she could escape that infuriating man.

She flopped onto the bed and opened her video app. A sharp knock interrupted her.

"Open the door." Ethan Roscente's deep voice penetrated the wood.

Jenna bolted upright. "What do you want?" She glared at the door.

"You think hiding here will stop me?" Amusement laced his tone. "Either open it yourself, or I'll use my key."

Jenna smacked her forehead. She'd forgotten Ethan had a spare key!

"Damn it!" She yanked the door open, teeth clenched.

Ethan hooked an arm around her shoulders and hauled her toward the master bedroom without explanation. The lock clicked again.

Jenna pressed her back against the curtains, eyes narrowed. "What are you planning?"

Ethan flexed his wrists, smirking. "Nothing illegal between husband and wife."

"Bullshit!" Her fingers twisted into the fabric. "No consent means rape!"

A vein pulsed at Ethan's temple. "You agreed to be with me last night."

"That doesn't mean sex tonight!" She jutted her chin. "I need time to warm up!"

He massaged his temples. The woman's imagination ran wild—he hadn't even considered that.

Stretching across the bed, he crooked a finger. "Come rub my shoulders."

"No!" Jenna burrowed deeper into the curtains.

Ethan's eyes slitted. "Do it, or I'll claim my husbandly rights tonight."

Jenna gasped. When had he become so shameless?

She inched toward the bed with obvious reluctance. "My own shoulders ache..."

"I'm your husband." He closed his eyes, savoring her touch. "I'll return the favor later."

"Like hell!" She scoffed. "You'll just cop a feel."

Ethan's eyes flew open. "Afraid I'll touch you?"

Jenna choked on her own saliva, face burning crimson.
###Chapter 365

Ethan propped himself up on one elbow, brows furrowing slightly. "What's wrong?"

Jenna stood barefoot on the floor, bent over as violent coughs wracked her body, turning her face crimson.

Her throat burned with raw pain.

She hurried to the living room and gulped down a glass of lukewarm water before finding relief.

When she returned to the bedroom, Ethan was already sitting up. She grabbed her sleepwear. "I'll shower first."

"Mhm."

After her shower, she found Ethan spreading out bedding on the floor.

Jenna couldn't suppress a laugh.

He turned to look at her.

"Addicted to sleeping on the floor now?" She walked over to him.

"Wasn't it you who refused the bed?" He continued smoothing the sheets. "I'm keeping you company."

"Then enjoy the floor." Jenna arched a brow. "Tonight, I'm taking the bed."

Who in their right mind would choose hard flooring over a plush mattress?

Ethan paused mid-motion. "No more floor sleeping?"

Jenna sat at the vanity and began her skincare routine. "I'm not an idiot."

Silently, Ethan gathered the bedding and stuffed it into the closet.

"Guess we won't need this anymore," he murmured.

Jenna pressed her lips together, amused.

After finishing her routine, she slipped under the covers.

When Ethan returned from washing up, his arm naturally draped over her shoulders. "This okay?"

"Mhm." Blushing, she turned toward him.

As the lights went out, he pulled her closer. "Do you dislike it when I touch you?"

Moonlight filtered through the curtains as Jenna answered, "I'm slow to warm up. Too much too soon makes me nervous—afraid you'll leave once you get what you want."

Ethan's arm stiffened.

"I won't let go." His voice was low and firm. "Jenna, I know you don't believe me, but when Ethan Roscente gives his word, he keeps it."

"Time will tell." She closed her eyes. "Goodnight."

"Goodnight."

Ethan understood her wariness. He'd prove through actions that he wasn't like Lucien Valois.

......

Jenna awoke at dawn's first light.

Beside her, Ethan breathed steadily in sleep. She carefully lifted his arm away.

Turning off the AC, she tucked the blanket snugly around him.

Assured he still slept, she crept from the bedroom on silent feet.

After freshening up, she tied on an apron and began breakfast preparations.

Remembering how long it'd been since she cooked for Ethan, she prepared extra dishes.

By the time morning rays brightened the sheer curtains, four stir-fried dishes adorned the table. Steam rose from bamboo baskets of flower buns and stuffed buns.

Wiping her hands, Jenna went to wake Ethan.
###Chapter 366

Morning sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains. Ethan Roscente stood before the bathroom mirror, brushing his teeth.

A gentle knock sounded at the door. "Breakfast is ready," Jenna Roland's soft voice called.

The water stopped running. Ethan responded with a quiet acknowledgment. Jenna turned and walked toward the dining area, pouring steaming soy milk into a cup.

Ethan soon appeared in the doorway. His gaze softened at the sight of four delicate side dishes and a bamboo steamer releasing wisps of heat on the table.

He approached Jenna and pressed a light kiss to her cheek.

"What time did you wake up?" Ethan pulled out a chair, his eyes never leaving her face.

Jenna handed him chopsticks. "Five. I thought you've been too busy lately—takeout isn't good for you."

Ethan picked up a translucent shrimp dumpling. "Thank you."

Jenna bit her lower lip. "I haven't been taking proper care of you these days..."

Ethan ruffled her hair. "Don't say that." His thumb brushed the corner of her eye. "Let's eat."

They enjoyed breakfast in comfortable silence. Jenna suddenly asked, "Would you like braised pork ribs or sweet and sour fish tomorrow?"

"Anything you make is good." Ethan stood to clear the dishes with efficient movements.

Water rushed in the kitchen sink. Jenna stood beside Ethan drying plates, their arms occasionally brushing.

"I'll go change." Jenna wiped her hands and hurried upstairs.

Ethan carried several packed bags of clothes downstairs. Wyatt Roland waited below, hesitating as he accepted the bundles.

"No need to follow today," Ethan said briefly before returning upstairs for the remaining items.

When he came back down, Jenna was already waiting at the gate on her e-tricycle. She wore a light blue shirt, her hair fluttering in the morning breeze.

Ethan loaded the last two bags and swung into the passenger seat.

Jenna turned in surprise. "You're not going to work today?"

"It's the weekend." He fastened his seatbelt, his gaze lingering on her hands gripping the steering wheel.

Jenna blinked. She remembered how Ethan used to spend weekends buried in his office.

The e-tricycle merged onto Sunset Boulevard. At a red light, Jenna checked her phone messages.

A black Audi Q7 pulled up beside them. The window rolled down, revealing Julian Cardenas' shocked expression.

"Mr. Roscente?" His voice trembled with disbelief.

Ethan turned. His eyes instantly turned frosty.

The light changed. Jenna smoothly accelerated. Julian remained frozen until impatient car horns startled him back to reality.

He slammed the gas pedal, his eyes locked on the e-tricycle carrying the CEO of HM Group.
###Chapter 367

Julian Cardenas's gaze locked onto the familiar figure on the sidewalk outside Mall of America.

The black Maybach pulled over slowly. The window rolled down as Julian narrowed his eyes.

Ethan Roscente was bending over to help a girl arrange clothes on a street vendor's rack, his movements practiced like a seasoned pro.

Julian rubbed his eyes to make sure he wasn't hallucinating.

The CEO of HM Group—a titan of the business world—was running a street stall?

What shocked him even more was the way Ethan looked at the girl.

Uncharacteristically tender.

Julian pulled out his phone and dialed Ethan's number.

When the call connected, he saw Ethan frown and retrieve his phone.

"Speak." Ethan's voice was icy.

"Mr. Roscente... why are you selling clothes on the street?" Julian asked cautiously.

"Buying." The reply was curt.

Julian nearly choked on his own saliva.

"But sir—"

"Hurry up."

The call ended abruptly.

Julian took a deep breath and stepped out of the car toward the stall.

He picked up a pink T-shirt at random. "How much for this?"

The girl turned around, and Julian finally got a clear look at her.

Delicate features. Bright eyes. A smile like a fresh daisy.

No wonder the CEO had broken precedent to help.

"Sixty-five. Opening price for you." Her voice was crisp.

Julian grabbed three more items.

"That'll be two-sixty." As the girl started calculating, Ethan suddenly spoke. "Good quality. Shouldn't you buy more?"

Julian's eye twitched.

He was forced to take three additional pieces.

"Get two skirts too." Ethan crossed his arms.

Julian almost turned to stone on the spot.

A bachelor buying this many women's clothes?

But under Ethan's unyielding stare, he could only grit his teeth and nod.
###Chapter 368

Jenna Roland picked two dresses from the rack—one pure white as snow, the other soft pink like cherry blossoms.

"These would suit your girlfriend perfectly," she said, handing them to Julian Cardenas.

Ethan Roscente spotted some short skirts hanging nearby. He casually yanked two off the rack and tossed them in front of Julian. "These match your girlfriend's vibe better."

Julian's face darkened instantly. It was clear now—Ethan wasn't just trying to rip him off, but also mocking him!

Jenna quickly grabbed Ethan's sleeve. "He's a customer. Be polite."

"Hmm?" Ethan raised an eyebrow.

"Customer comes first," Jenna whispered. "Throwing clothes like that is rude."

The fact that Julian had followed them here without causing a scene was already the height of courtesy!

"Oh." Ethan responded indifferently.

Julian cleared his throat awkwardly and handed the clothes to Jenna. "Just wrap them all up."

"Great!" Jenna's eyes lit up. "Would you like to check out our new lace lingerie? Your girlfriend will love it."

Julian's lips twitched. What girlfriend?

If Ethan hadn't threatened him, he wouldn't even glance at this cheap merchandise!

He glared at Ethan, then forced a fake smile at Jenna. "Sure."

He'd only meant to track Ethan's movements—never expected to get fleeced instead!

Ethan took the clothes. "I'll handle checkout. You go organize the racks."

Jenna hesitated, glancing at Julian before turning to hang up clothes.

"Shorts—ninety-nine. Skirt—one-thirty. T-shirt—one-sixty..." Ethan drawled the prices.

Julian's eyes widened. The girl had just said the T-shirt was only sixty-five!

Jenna spun around and hissed in Ethan's ear. "Are you insane? Doubling the prices will scare him off!"

"Audi-driving cash cow," Ethan smirked. "Relax. He won't run."

"Total's thirteen hundred," Ethan pushed the bag toward Julian. "Cash or scan?"

Julian nearly choked. Items worth five or six hundred had more than doubled!

"Scan!" He gritted his teeth and pulled out his phone. From now on, he'd cross the street to avoid Ethan!

Ethan waved the payment QR code.

Julian paid and turned to leave.

"Your clothes," Ethan reminded.

Julian stormed back, snatched the bag, and vanished into the crowd without a backward glance.

Jenna looked worried. "He'll never come back."

Ethan slung an arm around her shoulders. "Regular customers wouldn't spend this much in a lifetime."

"But—"

"Rich people's money? Easy come, easy go." He pinched her cheek playfully. "Come on, back to work."
###Chapter 369

Jenna Roland's stall was swarmed with customers. Ethan Roscente stood there like a living advertisement.

Women lined up to buy clothes, but their eyes remained glued to Ethan.

Cash fluttered into the money box like snowflakes.

Three stalls away, Lily Evans gripped her clothing rack tightly. Her nails dug into her palms as she glared at Jenna's back.

Ever since Jenna arrived on this street, Lily's business had collapsed. The prime spot at the intersection now belonged to that little vixen. Worst of all, that man's presence had lured away her last few customers.

"Homewrecker!" Lily spat viciously.

Tanya Hill had noticed Lily's venomous stare. During a lull, she tugged Jenna's sleeve.

"Be careful, dear," Tanya whispered. "That dress seller looks ready to murder you."

Jenna glanced at Lily and shrugged. "Let her stare."

"You stubborn girl!" Tanya clapped her thighs in frustration. "Jealousy drives people mad!"

Jenna flashed her a sweet smile before bouncing over to Ethan. "What do you want for lunch? My treat!"

Sunlight filtered through the trees, casting golden flecks on Ethan's lashes as his eyes crinkled with amusement.

"Whatever you make," he said tenderly. "Street food isn't hygienic."

Jenna checked her phone. "Should I go buy groceries now?"

"Mhm." Ethan stood to help pack up the stall. "I'll watch things here."

As the e-tricycle puttered away, Tanya teased, "Little Jenna can cook?"

Ethan's lips curved unconsciously. "She's full of surprises."

Remembering his initial misconceptions about Jenna, he now found them laughable. The image of her bustling in the kitchen, ponytail swaying, had gradually etched itself into his heart.

Grandma Blanche was right—this girl was an uncut gem.
###Chapter 370

Tanya Hill watched Ethan Roscente effortlessly greet customers, his slender fingers dancing across the calculator keys. Sunlight illuminated his chiseled profile, and even the slight furrow of his brow as he tallied numbers exuded an air of elite sophistication.

She sighed. Her own son could never measure up to a man like this.

......

Aromatic scents wafted from the kitchen. Jenna Roland swiftly packed braised pork ribs into an insulated container and ladled steaming clam soup with winter melon. The wall clock showed 1:20 PM.

Grabbing the lunchbox, she dashed outside.

Her e-bike screeched to a halt outside Mall of America. Jenna weaved through the crowd, the thermos swaying in her grip. "Ethan!" She skidded to a breathless stop at his stall. "Eat first."

His fingers brushed hers as he took the container. "You haven't eaten either?"

"Waiting for you." Jenna turned toward the neighboring stall. "Aunt Tanya, mind if we borrow your table?"

The moment the folding table clicked open, the sweet-sour aroma of sweet and sour pork filled the air. Nearby vendors instinctively sniffed.

Tanya approached as the sizzling beef with peppers glistened with oil. "You've got real talent, Jenna," she marveled, eyeing the glistening steamed egg with shrimp.

"I'll make extra tomorrow. Want to join us?" Jenna offered chopsticks.

Tanya stole a glance at Ethan's expression. The man was intently ladling soup for Jenna without even looking up.

"He doesn't mind these things." Jenna placed a rib in Ethan's bowl.

After the crowd dispersed, Jenna suddenly gasped. "Tomorrow's Monday?" She noticed Ethan's hands pause while packing the containers. "Then... I'll wake up early to cook."

Two girls in JK uniforms stopped at the stall. Blushing, they stole glances at Ethan before purchasing three pairs of earrings.

Jenna chuckled while counting the bills. With this man around, their stall might as well have a human lucky cat statue.
###Chapter 371

10:00 AM sharp.

Jenna Roland had just finished packing up her street stall when her phone rang abruptly.

The name "Ethan Roscente" flashing on the screen made her eyebrows lift.

"Ethan?" She propped her chin on one hand, scanning the empty stall before her.

"We found her." His voice came through the receiver. "Under a bridge. Barely alive."

Her fingers twitched.

The words "barely alive" stabbed into her heart like a knife.

Almost too late.

"Who did this?" Her voice tightened.

"Yvonne Valois." A pause. "Lucien Valois's woman."

A chill crawled up Jenna's spine.

Broad daylight, and they dared to commit murder?

"Isn't she afraid of prison?" She clenched the phone.

"Mayor Valois is her shield." Ethan's冷笑 was icy. "That woman has powerful connections."

Cold sweat beaded on Jenna's forehead.

Thank God she'd listened to the Savigny sisters' warning.

"Sylvia needs to leave Los Angeles immediately." She lowered her voice.

"Agreed."

"Which hospital is your friend at? I want to thank them in person."

"Unnecessary." He rattled off the hospital address and hung up without ceremony.

Jenna immediately dialed Stella Laurent.

A sleepy mumble answered.

"We found your sister!" Jenna's voice was urgent. "At Los Angeles General Hospital!"

Stella's breathing hitched.

The call disconnected. Within seconds, Jenna heard frantic rustling—clothes being thrown on in panic.

One hour later.

Stella burst into the hospital room to find Sylvia Savigny asleep beneath an oxygen mask.

Her legs gave out. Only a hand clamped over her mouth stifled the scream.

Her sister's face was swollen beyond recognition.

Bandages wrapped her head. Bruises mottled her lips purple.

A cast suspended her left leg midair. An IV tube snaked into her right hand.

Tears splattered the linoleum.

The choked sobs woke the patient.

Sylvia pried open swollen eyelids with visible effort.
###Chapter 372

Sylvia's lashes fluttered at the sound of approaching footsteps. She didn't need to open her eyes to know who it was.

Stella stood by the hospital bed, silent tears streaming down her face. She bit her lip hard, afraid to disturb the fragile figure beneath the white sheets.

"Big sis..." Stella finally choked out, her voice breaking.

Sylvia turned her face away, brows furrowed. She couldn't bear for her sister to see her like this.

Stella grabbed her hand, hot tears splashing onto the sterile bedding. "Do you have any idea how terrified I was? If you'd died, I wouldn't want to live either!"

Sylvia's shoulders trembled slightly. Memories flooded back—the cruel words she'd hurled at her sister, the shameful entanglement with Lucien Valois for money.

How ironic. What right did she have to lecture anyone?

"Does it hurt?" Stella asked softly.

Sylvia shook her head. She looked too wretched to even speak. The oxygen mask fogged with each shallow breath.

"I'm sorry..." Sylvia's whisper was feather-light.

Stella wiped her tears. "Jenna helped so much. If she hadn't pulled strings to find you..."

"Jenna?" Sylvia's eyes flickered with recognition.

"Her friend has connections at the police station," Stella explained. "When you recover, we must thank her properly."

Sylvia closed her eyes. She remembered the biting cold under the bridge, the terrifying sensation of blood leaving her body. Jenna had given her a second chance at life.

A phone rang abruptly.

"How is she?" Jenna's voice came through the receiver.

Stella glanced at the bed. "Badly injured, but stable."

"Yvonne won't let this go," Jenna said gravely. "Once she's discharged, you both should leave town."

Hanging up, Stella squeezed her sister's hand. "Let's go back home, sis."

Sylvia stared at the ceiling. She knew there was no choice. For Stella's sake, she had to survive.
###Chapter 373

"Alright." Sylvia replied softly, forcing a faint smile. "When we return to our hometown, we'll build a new house. We'll raise some chickens and ducks, plant vegetables. Then I'll find you a good matchmaker."

"Let's talk about that later." Stella stood up. "You should rest now. I'll go ask the doctor about your condition."

Sylvia closed her eyes as Stella turned and left the hospital room.

The moment she stepped into the hallway, two men in black suits approached.

Stella paid them no mind and walked straight to the doctor's office.

Inside, several physicians were busy at work. A female doctor looked up. "Can I help you?"

"I'm Sylvia Savigny's family member."

The doctor set down the medical chart. "I'm her attending physician."

"Doctor, my sister's injuries..." Stella's voice tightened.

"Left leg fracture required surgery. Three broken ribs were stabilized. Mild concussion that needs monitoring. The external injuries aren't severe."

Stella's pupils constricted. Her fingers trembled uncontrollably.

"Will...will she need the metal plates removed later?"

"Of course." The doctor nodded. "At least two weeks hospitalization. No heavy labor after discharge."

"Thank you, Doctor." Stella bowed deeply.

The doctor waved a hand. "Just doing my job."

As Stella turned to leave, she froze in the doorway.

"Let go of my sister!" She grabbed a chair and swung it at the man choking Sylvia. "Help! Murder!"

The man backhanded her across the face. Stella's vision went dark.

She sank her teeth into the attacker's arm. His companion punched her squarely in the face.

Stella collapsed limply to the floor.

"You animals!" Sylvia's eyes bulged with rage. Every wound screamed in agony.

"Move!" The accomplice yanked the man's arm. "She shouted too loud—people are coming!"

The two fled in panic.

Footsteps pounded down the hallway. Sylvia mustered her last strength to scream: "Help..."
###Chapter 374

A searing pain shot through Sylvia Savigny's left leg as she tried to get out of bed. Cold sweat soaked through her hospital gown.

Hurried footsteps echoed in the hallway.

"Doctor!" Sylvia's voice trembled. "My sister was attacked. Please help her!"

Three white-coated physicians rushed in. Nurses restrained Sylvia as she struggled to rise. "Don't move! You'll reopen your wounds."

Clutching the sheets, Sylvia watched them examine Stella Laurent.

"Just temporary unconsciousness." The doctor removed his stethoscope. "No life-threatening injuries."

Stella's eyes flew open. She grabbed the doctor's sleeve. "Someone's trying to kill my sister! I need to call the police!"

The doctor frowned. "Who?"

"Yvonne Valois!" Blood trickled from Stella's split lip. "She must have sent them!"

Twenty minutes later, police sirens pierced the hospital corridor.

Whispers spread through the gathered crowd. Stella pointed at her swollen cheek. "Those men in black almost strangled my sister!"

Inspector Cole Macmillan flipped open his notepad. "Any personal enemies?"

"Lucien Valois's wife!" Stella rasped. "She kidnapped my sister, beat her half to death, and dumped her under an overpass!"

A murmur rippled through the ward.

The inspector's pen paused. "Evidence?"

"My sister is the witness!" Stella turned toward the bed.

Sylvia gave a weak nod. "They said I touched someone I shouldn't have..."

Another officer lowered his voice. "Lucien Valois is the mayor's son."

Inspector Macmillan snapped his notebook shut. "We'll need your formal statement."

"But who'll protect my sister if I leave?" Stella stamped her foot in frustration.

Suddenly she pulled out her phone. "Jenna, please come to the hospital now!"

At her clothing stall, Jenna Roland's hanger clattered to the ground. "Yvonne's trying to wipe them out!"

She swiftly packed up her merchandise. Her e-tricycle sped toward the hospital through the night.
###Chapter 375

Jenna Roland pushed open the hospital room door to find Sylvia Savigny alone inside.

Sylvia's eyes flew open, filled with terror. Only when she recognized the visitor did her tense shoulders relax.

"It's you." Sylvia exhaled sharply.

Jenna hurried to the bedside. "Did those men in black come back?"

Sylvia shook her head, fingers absently twisting the blanket edge. "I keep fearing they'll appear suddenly."

Jenna pulled up a chair, her gaze lingering on Sylvia's bandaged arms. "Can you tell me exactly what happened?"

Sylvia recounted the kidnapping ordeal in a trembling voice. By the end, her words had faded to a whisper.

"Yvonne Valois won't let me go." Sylvia gave a bitter smile. "Not even if I flee to the ends of the earth."

Jenna clenched her fists. "Just because she has power and influence?"

"We can't fight her." Sylvia's eyes dimmed. "I just want Stella to be safe."

Jenna suddenly stood. "I have a friend at the police station. Maybe he can help."

"It's useless." Sylvia shook her head. "Even Lucien Valois couldn't protect me, let alone..."

"Then we'll use public opinion!" Jenna's eyes lit up. "Expose her crimes online."

Sylvia froze. "That..."

"I'll make a call." Jenna strode toward the door. "Rest for now."

In the hallway, Jenna dialed Liam Hill's number. Before the call connected, she glanced back at the closed door.

Through the glass window, Sylvia lay staring blankly at the ceiling.
###Chapter 376

Jenna's fingers twisted the hem of her shirt when the call connected.

"Officer Hill, it's Jenna Roland." Her voice was deliberately hushed. "We met at the police station."

Liam's steady baritone came through the receiver. "I remember. What's wrong?"

She drew a sharp breath. "My friend used to be Lucien Valois's mistress. After Yvonne found out, she sent men to kidnap her. They nearly killed her."

Her nails dug into her palms as she stared at the sterile hospital walls.

"Now she's in the hospital, and someone tried to murder her again." Jenna's voice trembled. "The perpetrator has powerful connections. Are we really out of options?"

A faint clink of glass being set down sounded through the phone.

"Evidence?" Liam's tone turned grave. "Kidnapping, attempted murder—we need solid proof."

Jenna bit her lower lip. "Everyone knows it's Yvonne. Only hospital staff had this room number, yet the assassin found her instantly."

The rustle of flipping papers carried through the line.

"The law only cares about evidence." A lighter clicked as Liam lit a cigarette. "Audio recordings, video footage, eyewitnesses—we need it all."

"But she has the mayor backing her!" Jenna's voice cracked.

Smoke laced Liam's quiet chuckle. "The higher they climb, the harder they fall. Find me proof, and I'll handle this personally."

Jenna's head snapped up, fire igniting in her eyes.

"Deal." Each word was deliberate. "We'll get you the evidence."

After hanging up, she pushed open the hospital room door.

Sylvia sat motionless, staring at the IV drip.

"The police need proof." Jenna took her icy hand.

Sylvia gave a bitter smile. "We're prisoners in this room. Where would we even look?"

Jenna leaned close, whispering in her ear.

"What?" Sylvia's eyes widened. "That's too dangerous!"

"It's our only shot." Jenna's gaze burned with determination. "We have to force her to show her hand."

Sylvia watched the darkening sky outside the window before nodding slowly.

Two shadows melted into the blackness of the hospital corridor as night descended.
###Chapter 377

Sylvia Savigny stared at the ceiling, fingers tapping lightly on the bedsheet. Better to take action than wait helplessly. At least this way, there was a sliver of hope.

She nodded slowly, agreeing to Jenna Roland's plan.

"In my current condition, I'll have to wait until I'm discharged," Sylvia said, her voice weak but resolute.

The hospital door swung open as Stella Laurent hurried in, looking exhausted.

"Did they file the case?" Jenna asked urgently.

Stella sank into a chair. "The police said there's insufficient evidence. They'll only pursue the two men in black for now." She gave a bitter smile. "Masks and hats—like finding a needle in a haystack."

All three knew the case would go nowhere.

"I have a new plan," Jenna lowered her voice. "We'll execute it after your sister is discharged."

Stella frowned. "What plan?"

As Jenna explained, Stella paled. "It's too dangerous! What if—"

"That's why we need Officer Liam Hill as a witness," Jenna's eyes gleamed. "Video and photos—irrefutable evidence."

"But the Valois family's influence—"

"Prepare two copies," Jenna cut in. "If the police ignore it, we'll go public. Let public opinion crush her."

After a moment's thought, Stella finally nodded.

Jenna pulled two pepper sprays from her bag. "Take these for protection."

"Where did you get these?" Stella gasped, accepting one.

"Prepared them when I worked at the club," Jenna shrugged. "Essential for self-defense."

Stella tucked the other under her sister's pillow.

"I should go," Jenna checked her watch.

Stella walked her to the elevator and hugged her tightly. "Thank you."

"Don't mention it," Jenna patted her back.

As the elevator doors closed, Jenna exhaled deeply. She decided to take a break—the street vending had worn her out.

Just outside the hospital entrance, Jenna froze mid-step.

Lucien Valois was approaching, flanked by two bodyguards in black.

Her pulse spiked. If that madwoman knew Lucien's true intentions...

Lucien's gaze lingered on her face for a second before coolly shifting away. He passed by without expression, as if she were a stranger.

Jenna clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.
###Chapter 378

Jenna Roland froze in place.

She stood right in front of Lucien Valois, yet he walked past her as if she were invisible.

After searching for her for so long, wouldn’t he even spare her a glance?

Her heart clenched as if gripped by an invisible hand.

Unable to resist, she turned back—only to meet Lucien’s deep, penetrating gaze. He had been watching her all along.

Flustered, Jenna quickly faced forward again, her nails digging into her palms.

Lucien stared at her retreating figure, a flicker of sorrow in his eyes. Without a word, he turned and entered the hospital doors.

Jenna mounted her e-bike and rode aimlessly for a while before remembering she needed groceries.

Back in the Beverly Hills kitchen, she chopped vegetables while calling Ethan Roscente.

"Will you be home for dinner?"

After his confirmation, she dialed Milo Roland.

"Sorry, sis. I’m taking care of Ryan Watson tonight."

Hanging up, Jenna surveyed the dusty living room and grabbed a rag to clean.

The washing machine hummed as she stuffed in sheets and pillowcases.

By the time she finished chores, dusk had settled outside.

A hot shower washed away her exhaustion. Tying on an apron, she started dinner.

At 6:30 sharp, the lock clicked.

Ethan tiptoed into the bedroom, placing a bouquet of red roses on the nightstand.

"You're back?" Jenna emerged from the kitchen with dishes. "Wash up for dinner."

Four dishes and a soup steamed on the table—all Ethan’s favorites.

"Why only my preferred foods?" He frowned.

She handed him chopsticks with a smile. "Because you love them."

"You should think of yourself more." He placed a chicken wing in her bowl. "You’ve lost weight."

"Nonsense." But she obediently took a bite.

They exchanged servings across the table, the meal filled with warmth.

Midway, Jenna suddenly set down her utensils. "Ethan… do powerful people really face no consequences?"

He paused. "Ordinary people struggle against them."

"So we just endure injustice?" Her voice dropped to a whisper.
###Chapter 379

Ethan Roscente's slender fingers tapped the table, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Only the weak complain about fate. The strong rewrite the rules. The Yangs and the Lu family? Mere ants. If you're powerful enough, even the elite circles will bow before you."

Jenna Roland clenched the hem of her shirt, her knuckles turning white. "Easy for you to say. For ordinary people, climbing the social ladder is harder than reaching the heavens!"

"Old Man Savigny started with a street stall," Ethan sneered. "Now everyone calls him 'Sir Savigny.' Opportunity favors the prepared."

Jenna jerked her head up, defiance flashing in her eyes. "That's one in a million! If Sylvia hadn't met her benefactor, Yvonne would've destroyed her long ago!"

Their shadows stretched starkly under the light, two worlds colliding.

Ethan stood atop the clouds, born the heir of HM Group. Jenna fought through the mud, scraping together every penny for her brother's medical bills.

"You could've walked away," Ethan narrowed his eyes.

"That day at Studio 54..." Jenna's voice trembled. "When Lucien slapped Sylvia in public, I should've stepped in."

Her nails dug into her palms. "I'm the reason she lost her protector and became Yvonne's target."

Ethan suddenly closed the distance between them, his breath hot. "What if Yvonne turns on you next?"

"Bring it on!" Jenna grabbed a fruit knife and slammed it into the table. "I'll trade my life for hers!"

The blade vibrated with a metallic hum.

Ethan studied her flushed face and suddenly chuckled. "What a stubborn one." He flicked the knife handle. "Who'll take care of your brother if you die?"

"The surgery was successful." Jenna lifted her chin. "He'll—"

"Eat." Ethan shoved a shrimp dumpling into her mouth. "It's getting cold."

An eerie silence fell over the dining table.

While washing dishes, Jenna kicked the sink. "The drain's clogged."

Ethan rolled up his tailored shirt sleeves, revealing toned forearms. Crouching down, he sent a voice message to his assistant: "Sign me up for a crash course in plumbing. Now."

Water droplets splashed onto his Patek Philippe watch.
###Chapter 380

Lucas Roscente was buried in quarterly reports when his phone vibrated. He glanced at the screen and froze at the caller ID - "Ethan Roscente."

"Mr. Roscente?" Lucas answered, confusion lacing his voice.

"Do you know how to fix a clogged drain?" Ethan's deep voice came through the receiver.

Lucas nearly dropped his phone. He double-checked the caller ID - it was indeed the titan of Wall Street.

"May I ask...why?" He treaded carefully.

"Just answer the question." Impatience sharpened Ethan's tone.

Lucas swallowed hard. "Basic knowledge. First, you'll need to detach the pipe and check for blockages..."

The line went dead.

Ethan crouched beneath the kitchen sink. As he unscrewed the pipe joint, a putrid stench assaulted him.

Rotting vegetable scraps clung to the interior. Gritting his teeth, Ethan picked out the sludge with gloved fingers.

When he turned the faucet back on, water gushed from the loose connection. He shut it off immediately, brows furrowed.

"Still not fixed?" Jenna's voice carried from the living room.

Ethan stood, water stains blooming on his shirt cuffs. "Requires specialized tools."

Jenna pointed to the doorframe. "The building posted a plumber's number."

The advertised plumber informed him they were closed. Ethan hung up and dialed Lucas again.

"Purchase drain-cleaning tools. Deliver to Beverly Hills."

Lucas abandoned his paperwork and raced to the hardware store. One hour later, he handed the tool bag to Ethan outside the luxury condominium.

Watching his boss march upstairs with plumbing gear, Lucas rubbed his eyes. Moonlight illuminated the absurd sight - the impeccably tailored CEO now wrestling with a clogged drain.

"Only in a million years." Lucas shook his head and disappeared into the night.
###Chapter 381

The first rays of sunlight barely touched the market stalls when Jenna Roland finished setting up her booth. She adjusted the T-shirts on the display rack with practiced ease before settling onto the small stool behind her counter.

The first customers arrived quickly—three young women browsing through her selection. Jenna stood to greet them, enthusiastically pointing out different designs.

Then a woman in her fifties shoved through the group. Her faded floral blouse was wrinkled, dirt still caked under her fingernails. Lydia Lombardi grabbed a white T-shirt without looking. "How much for this rag?" she barked.

"That's premium cotton, ma'am. Fifty-five dollars," Jenna replied with a professional smile.

"Fifty-five?" Lydia screeched. "You think I'm stupid? This flea market junk isn't worth half that!"

Jenna's smile froze. In six months of street vending, she'd never encountered such rudeness.

"The fabric won't pill or stretch. My wholesale cost was thirty. Fifty-five is very reasonable," she explained through gritted teeth.

Lydia threw the shirt on the ground. "Pah! I could buy three pounds of pork for that!"

The two browsing customers hastily put down their selections and hurried away. Jenna's hands trembled with anger at the lost sale.

Tanya Hill from the adjacent shoe stall waddled over, her plump frame radiating indignation. "Hey lady, either buy something or stop harassing her!"

"None of your damn business!" Lydia planted her hands on her hips. "These crooks need to be exposed!"

Tanya's temper ignited. "Cheapskate! Can't afford fifty-five? Maybe you should walk around naked!"

Their shouting match erupted instantly. Every time Lydia tried to retort, Tanya drowned her out with louder insults. Nearby vendors began gathering, adding their own commentary.

Jenna watched the spectacle coldly. "Calling you 'ma'am' was too generous. Save some decency unless you want karma biting your kids."

Just then, the woman minding Tanya's stall came rushing over.
###Chapter 382

"Can't we criticize her outrageous pricing? Ganging up on one person—have you no shame?" a woman shrieked in support.

Tanya Hill sneered. "Oh, defending her like she's your mother or ancestor? No wonder your stall's deserted!"

Hannah Kalmien, the sock vendor, chimed in. "Fifty-five for a T-shirt isn't expensive. If you can't afford it, scram. All this whining—she deserves a lesson!"

Other vendors, disgusted by Lydia Lombardi's attitude, rallied behind Jenna Roland.

Lydia turned to leave, cursing under her breath.

Jenna suddenly exploded. "You old hag! May your son die heirless, get run over by a car, and leave your daughter-in-law a miserable widow!"

She hadn't meant to go this far, but the vile woman had insulted her parents—her ultimate red line.

Lydia spun around, jabbing a finger inches from Jenna's face. "You poisonous little bitch! You'll die in the gutter!"

"Say that again," Jenna stepped closer.

"I said your whole family deserves to rot! Worthless trash!" Lydia spat.

Tanya egged her on. "Jenna, slap her already!"

Without hesitation, Jenna backhanded Lydia across the face. "You asked for it, you old witch."

Lydia clutched her cheek, eyes bulging.

"One wasn't enough?" Jenna delivered another stinging slap, then yanked her hair, slamming her to the ground.

When the clothing vendor tried to intervene, Tanya and others blocked her.

Jenna pulled out her phone to call the police.

"Enjoy jail," she said coldly, staring at Lydia sprawled on the pavement.

Tanya added, "That's disorderly conduct—we'll all testify."

Panicked, Lydia tugged her companion's sleeve. "Help me up! Let's go!"

Sophia Valrose, her daughter-in-law, hissed, "Mom, we can't just leave! Let the cops handle this!"

Tanya raised an eyebrow. "You're her daughter?"

Supporting her mother-in-law, Sophia glared. "I'm her daughter-in-law!"
###Chapter 383

Tanya Hill curled her lips in a cold smirk. "So that's how it is. You're jealous because Jenna's business is better than yours, so you sent your mother-in-law to cause trouble? Birds of a feather!"

Jenna Roland's pupils constricted sharply.
She never imagined this Lydia Lombardi was actually Sophia Valrose's mother-in-law.

Just days ago, Tanya had warned her that Sophia was envious of her success.
And now she'd already sent someone for revenge?

Sophia helped Lydia to her feet, her face dark with fury. "Why should she get ahead so fast? Why did she have to set up right in front of me? She ruined my business!"

Jenna almost laughed at the absurdity.
"I can set up wherever I want. If you can't compete, that's your problem."

Tanya crossed her arms, sneering. "Sophia, you're pathetic. Can't handle competition, so you send your mother-in-law to do your dirty work? No shame at all?"

Sophia's face flushed crimson.
Knowing she was in the wrong, she tried dragging Lydia away.

Jenna blocked their path in one swift move. "I've already called the police. They'll be here any minute."
Tanya also barred their escape. "Think you can just run? Not happening."

Sophia ground her teeth. "The street doesn't belong to you! Get out of our way!"
Lydia spat venomously, "Good dogs don't block the road!"

"You scared off my customers and think you can walk away?" Jenna stood her ground.

Hannah Kalmien suddenly interjected, "Sophia, you sabotaged her business first, and your mother-in-law cursed Jenna's parents. Now you won't even apologize?"

She gave Jenna a meaningful look. "Jenna isn't someone you can bully."
That much was true.

Jenna had once chased her uncle around the yard with a cleaver.
She wouldn't let this slide.

Sophia kept deflecting. "She insulted us too! Why should we apologize?"
Hannah frowned deeply. "Are you serious? You started this!"

Just then, the wail of sirens approached.
A police car pulled up smoothly before the stalls.

Three officers stepped out, led by Inspector Liam Hill whom Jenna recognized.

Lydia and Sophia panicked, but Jenna and Tanya held them firmly in place.

Liam's sharp gaze swept over them. "Who called this in?"
His crisp uniform and chiseled features radiated authority.

Though puzzled by his question, Jenna raised her hand. "I did, Officer."
###Chapter 384

By the time Officer Liam Hill arrived, the crowd had formed an impenetrable wall.

Jenna Roland stepped forward and recounted every detail of Lydia Lombardi's deliberate provocation. She emphasized the venomous insults hurled at her family and revealed Sophia Valrose's instigation behind the scenes.

Lydia shrieked in protest, "Her clothes are outrageously priced! What's wrong with speaking my mind? Those customers left on their own—how is that my fault?"

Tanya Hill stood as a witness. "Fifty-five for a T-shirt is expensive? If you can't afford it, walk away. But you had to call them rags and spew profanities."

Hannah Kalmien chimed in, "She came here looking for trouble. We all saw it."

The onlookers murmured in agreement.

After hearing the accounts, Officer Hill turned to Lydia and Sophia. "You're causing a public disturbance. You’ll need to come with us."

Lydia paled and shoved Sophia aside. "Why arrest me? That bitch hit me! She pushed me! Officer, why aren’t you arresting her?"

Officer Hill scanned the crowd. "Did anyone see Jenna lay a hand on her?"

Tanya shook her head. "She's lying."

Hannah added, "Officer, people like her deserve punishment."

No one claimed to have witnessed any physical altercation.

Lydia trembled with rage. "You all saw it! Why are you protecting her? You’re in this together!"

Tanya smirked. "We side with justice, not favoritism. Unlike you two, who can’t stand seeing her business thrive."

Jenna felt a surge of gratitude for maintaining good relationships with her neighbors. She resolved to thank them properly later.

In the end, Lydia was taken away for disrupting public order. Sophia slunk off to pack up her stall.

Jenna bought ten bottles of soda and ten packs of cigarettes from the corner store, distributing them to the vendors who had stood up for her.

"Don’t be afraid if this happens again. We’ve got your back," they assured her warmly.

Her heart swelled. Setting up shop here had been the right decision.

Business quickly rebounded after the commotion died down.

During a brief lull, Tanya returned the cigarettes. "No one in my household smokes. You should take these back."

"Tanya, why don’t you open them and share with everyone?" Jenna suggested.

With a cheerful nod, Tanya broke open the packs and passed them around to the nearby stall owners.
###Chapter 385

At ten in the morning, Jenna Roland waved off her last customer and rubbed her sore shoulders.

She pulled out her phone and dialed Officer Liam Hill.

"Officer Hill, how's the Lydia Lombardi situation?"

His steady voice came through. "Seven-day detention and a five-hundred-dollar fine."

Jenna burst out laughing.

This outcome was even more satisfying than she'd expected.

"Did she throw a fit?"

"Doesn't matter how mad she is. The penalty stands." He paused. "By the way, how's your friend Sylvia?"

Jenna's expression darkened. "Pretty badly hurt. Any leads on those two attackers?"

"Security cameras only caught their backs. Masks and hats. No solid clues yet."

"Sounds like professionals."

"Not necessarily." His tone was firm. "We'll keep investigating."

Jenna changed the subject. "Free for lunch? My treat."

"On duty today. Rain check."

As she hung up and slipped her phone back into her pocket, the door chime jingled.

Milo Roland barged in, full of energy.

"Sis! Business looks good!"

Jenna eyed him up and down. "Ryan's out of the hospital?"

"He can walk on his own now." Milo's smile faltered. "But..."

"What's wrong?"

"His parents divorced. Neither wants him. They're making him drop out and get a job."

The cloth in Jenna's hand fell to the floor.

"He's only a sophomore!"

"So I was thinking..." Milo rubbed his hands together. "Sis, maybe we could help him?"

Jenna narrowed her eyes. "That's why you're here?"

Milo crouched in front of her with an ingratiating grin. "He's got such good grades. It'd be a waste if he quit school."

"A year's tuition plus living expenses would run at least five or six grand." Jenna sighed. "With your expenses too, that's a lot of pressure."

"Think of it as an investment!" His eyes sparkled. "Once he gets into college, he'll pay you back for sure!"

Jenna met her brother's hopeful gaze and felt her resolve soften.
###Chapter 386

"So you agree?" Milo's eyes lit up.

Jenna crossed her arms. "I'll sponsor him, but he has to pay me back."

With her current financial stability, funding Ryan's education wasn't an issue.

In the past, she would never have made such an offer.

Milo pouted. "Sponsorship means free money. Who asks for repayment?"

Jenna flicked his forehead. "Do I look like a money printer? Tell him I'll only cover his senior year if he agrees to repay me."

"What about living expenses?"

She rubbed her temples. Ryan was still hospitalized and couldn't work summer jobs. Winter break was his only option.

"After discharge, he can work at my stall—$100 per day. He'll earn $1,500 before school starts. Weekends at $100 for two days. You chip in occasionally, and he'll make it to graduation."

Milo gave a thumbs-up. "You're the best, sis!"

Jenna scoffed. "Only because he helped you and deserves pity..."

"Once he gains experience, he could start a small business after college. With luck, he might even become a boss."

"If he strikes it rich, he'll repay you tenfold!"

"Enough chatter!" She poked his forehead. "Watch the stall. I need the restroom."

"Got it!" Milo grinned.

——

At 3 PM Wednesday, Ethan stopped by the stall.

Coincidentally, urban management officers were conducting inspections.

They frantically loaded garments onto the e-tricycle.

After outrunning the officers, Jenna grinned ear to ear. "Thrilling, huh?"

Ethan sighed. "Being chased by authorities is an achievement?"

"Adrenaline rush! They'd have confiscated everything."

"Why not open a proper store?"

"Street vending earns more." She shook her head.

Returning later, they found the officers gone and reset their remaining merchandise.

"Join me for wholesale shopping tomorrow?" Jenna asked abruptly.

Ethan frowned. He had an important international conference in the morning.

"We leave at 6:30 AM," she added.

"That early?"

"Latecomers get leftovers." She winked.

Rubbing his temples, he relented. "Fine."
###Chapter 387

Ethan Roscente's slender fingers tapped rhythmically on his desk in the HM Group CEO office.

"Lucas, reschedule tomorrow's international conference to 2 PM."

The tablet nearly slipped from Lucas Roscente's grasp.

"Sir, our overseas branches have confirmed three times already. A last-minute change might—"

"I have arrangements." Ethan didn't look up, his tone brooking no argument.

Lucas swallowed hard. The workaholic CEO had never postponed meetings for personal reasons, let alone the crucial weekly global strategy session.

"May I... provide our international partners with an explanation?"

"Tell them I have urgent matters." Ethan flipped open a file. "Dismissed."

Lucas exited in a daze.

Last week's memory flashed before him—Ethan standing motionless by a street food stall, gaze fixed on a bustling young woman.

"Oh no..." Lucas muttered. "Is the CEO really falling for her?"

His mind conjured apocalyptic visions: an empty executive office, paperwork piling to the ceiling, while their illustrious CEO wore an apron making change at a night market...

———

Dawn barely tinted the sky at 6 AM.

Jenna Roland shoved the last jacket into her trunk and grinned at Ethan. "Perfect timing! We got the newest collection."

Ethan frowned at her wind-chapped nose.

"You could establish supplier contracts."

"New designers don't get those privileges." She rubbed her hands together. "Come on, let's check accessories."

Silently noting the wholesale market's name, Ethan hefted two garment bags and followed.

Inside the bustling marketplace, Jenna navigated stalls with practiced ease.

"Hold fifty of these hair clips for me!" She stretched toward the top shelf.

Ethan stood sentry, the ghost of a smile touching his lips as he watched excitement spark in her eyes.

"Guard the goods." She vanished into another vendor's booth.

He nodded, his towering frame drawing covert glances from passing shoppers. Yet his attention never wavered from that one busy figure weaving through the crowd.
###Chapter 388

Jenna Roland emerged from the wholesale market dragging two enormous bags of clothes. Sweat dampened the stray hairs clinging to her forehead.

She panted as she dropped the bundles at Ethan Roscente's feet, her cheeks flushed from exertion.

"There's one more bag upstairs." Wiping her brow, her eyes sparkled. "Wait here."

Ethan reached to help, but she dodged with surprising agility.

"I've got this!" She turned and sprinted upstairs, her ponytail bouncing behind her.

Within ten minutes, Jenna descended with a third oversized bundle obscuring her view. Yet her steps remained steady despite the obstructed vision.

"We should carry them together." Jenna scanned their surroundings warily. "What if someone steals the clothes?"

Ethan chuckled but obediently lifted two bags. Jenna clutched the remaining bundle protectively, like a mother bear guarding her cub.

Their e-tricycle waited by the market entrance. Jenna dashed over in quick strides, only relaxing after verifying the garments' safety.

"You need a proper vehicle." Ethan eyed the overloaded trike.

At the red light, Jenna hit the brakes.

"A minivan?" She scoffed. "Too expensive."

Ethan turned with focused intensity. "Used ones are affordable. More practical too."

Jenna nibbled her lip in thought. When the light turned green, she revved the engine.

"You're right." She sighed. "Should've asked around earlier."

At Mall of America, Jenna stretched as her stomach growled audibly.

"Come on, I'll buy you baozi." She winked at Ethan. "Their soy milk is amazing."

Tanya Hill was organizing merchandise at her stall. After entrusting her with the trike, Jenna tugged Ethan toward the breakfast shop.

Morning sunlight draped over them, casting elongated shadows. Jenna's steps turned light and lively, as if the earlier exhaustion had never existed.
###Chapter 389

Morning sunlight spilled across the street corner. After breakfast with Ethan Roscente, Jenna Roland watched as he helped set up her stall before leaving. He didn't call for his driver, opting to hail a cab to the office instead.

Her stall was draped with new clothing designs. Customers streamed in from the moment she opened, keeping her so busy she barely had time to sip water. Only by noon did she finally catch her breath.

Just as she sat down to rest, Milo Roland arrived with Ryan Watson in tow.

"Sis," Ryan said hesitantly, standing before the stall.

Jenna nodded in understanding and launched into a detailed explanation of street vending tips and pricing strategies. By the time she finished, it was nearly 11:30.

She headed to a nearby restaurant to order several dishes. When the food was ready, the staff delivered it directly to her stall.

Borrowing a folding table from Tanya Hill next door, Jenna set out the meal. "Aunt Tanya, would you like to join us?"

"No thanks, my husband's bringing lunch soon," Tanya replied with a wave.

After politely declining invitations from other nearby vendors, Jenna sat down to eat with Milo and Ryan.

"Ryan, the stall's profits aren't high, so I can only pay you $100 a day," Jenna said, placing a piece of meat in his bowl. "With two weeks until school starts, you'll earn about $1,500."

Ryan's eyes reddened. "Sis, you've already covered my medical bills and tuition. I'd work for free."

"You need income right now," Jenna insisted, adding more food to his bowl. "If you call me sis, then don't stand on ceremony."

Ryan ducked his head over his rice, blinking back tears. In all his life, only his grandparents had shown him such kindness. He silently vowed to repay Jenna someday.

After lunch, Jenna noticed Ryan's faded clothes and cracked shoes. Leaving the boys in charge of the stall, she hurried to a nearby mall.

She bought Ryan four outfits and selected two pairs of shoes plus socks in Milo's size.

As she returned with armfuls of shopping bags, she spotted a crowd gathered around her stall, angry shouts carrying through the air.

Her heart lurched. Jenna broke into a run.

Pushing through the crowd, she saw a hulking man raising his hand to strike Milo!

"Stop!" Jenna shouted.

Tanya and other vendors struggled to restrain the brute, but his massive frame overpowered them.

Jenna threw herself in front of Milo, glaring at the man. "Let him go!"
###Chapter 390

The man gripped Milo Roland's collar with bone-white knuckles.

Jenna Roland lunged forward, but his grip didn't loosen.

A feral glint flashed in Jenna's eyes as she sank her teeth into the man's wrist.

"Ah!" He howled in pain, shoving Milo away before backhanding Jenna across the face.

"You bitch!" Spittle flew from his twisted mouth as he raised his foot to kick her stomach.

Tanya Hill and her crew surged forward, forming a protective wall around Jenna.

"Cops are on their way!" Tanya barked. The burly men behind her took a synchronized step forward.

The man spat on the ground, unleashing a torrent of obscenities.

A fist cut through the air with a whoosh.

Someone's punch connected with the man's nose, sending blood gushing down his face.

A brutal kick to the back of his knees sent him crashing to the pavement.

Blows rained down like hail as he curled into a fetal position.

Jenna shook her head, trying to clear the ringing in her ears.

"Give me your shoe." She held out her hand to Milo.

The crowd parted like the Red Sea.

Jenna swung the sneaker, its rubber sole smacking against the man's face with dull thuds.

"I've hacked my own uncle with a cleaver!" Each swing carried the weight of her fury.

His screams mingled with cheers from the onlookers.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Jenna crouched to tie Milo's shoelaces, her fingers trembling slightly.

"Ryan!" Milo suddenly cried out.

The teenager lay curled on the ground, his T-shirt soaked with sweat.

Jenna pulled out her phone, blood from the attacker still smeared on her fingertips.

"Stay with me." She pressed down on Ryan's twitching arm.

Police uniforms pushed through the crowd.

Officer Liam Hill surveyed the chaotic scene with a frown.

"He threw the first punch." Milo pointed at the bloodied man. "Check the surveillance footage."

Tanya and the others nodded vigorously, all talking over each other to corroborate.

An ambulance siren pierced the night.

Jenna wiped her face, leaving a streak of blood across her hand.
###Chapter 391

The street vendors all testified, unanimously identifying the man as the instigator.

Officer Cole Macmillan glanced at the man curled up on the ground before turning to Jenna Roland. "What happened here?"

Jenna straightened her posture. "I hit him. He grabbed my brother by the collar—Milo just had surgery. I bit him, and he slapped me." She pointed to the blood at the corner of her mouth. "See? My ears are still ringing."

Officer Cole frowned. "But his injuries are severe. For a young woman like you—"

"I kicked the back of his knee," Jenna said bluntly. "When he dropped, I kicked him a few more times."

Milo immediately chimed in. "Officer, look at his size. We stood no chance. My friend just had an appendectomy and can't even stand straight now. This was clearly assault!"

The man on the ground groaned, his swollen lips unable to form coherent words.

Officer Liam Hill crouched beside him. "Name? Why did you attack the stall?"

"I... was..." The man slurred.

Jenna clenched her fists. "Officer, punish this bastard properly!"

Liam's gaze lingered on Jenna's face—her left cheek swollen, her ear flushed red, blood trickling from her lip. He averted his eyes calmly. "Call an ambulance."

Soon, sirens wailed as paramedics arrived.

The medical team loaded the man and Ryan Watson into the ambulance. Jenna accompanied them while Milo stayed to pack up their stall. Liam and Cole followed to the hospital.

In the examination room, the doctor frowned. "What's your relation to Ryan?"

"My brother's classmate. He was helping at our stall." Jenna asked urgently, "How is he?"

"Post-op wound rupture with internal bleeding," the doctor admonished. "He needs immediate debridement surgery."

Jenna dug her nails into her palms. She never should've let Ryan help.

"Operate as soon as possible," she said, voice trembling.

The doctor turned to Liam. "The other patient's condition is worse. Three fractured ribs, a broken leg, perforated eardrum, and internal bleeding."

Liam glanced at Jenna. He knew full well she couldn't have inflicted such damage alone. But for now, he remained silent.

"Treat the injuries first," Liam told the doctor.

The doctor shook his head helplessly. "We need family consent for surgery."
###Chapter 392 

Liam Hill flashed his police badge. "The family can't be reached right now. I'll sign the surgical consent form."

The doctor glanced at the credentials and immediately went to assemble the surgical team.

As the red light above the operating room lit up, Jenna Roland's phone rang. It was Milo calling to check on Ryan Watson's condition.

"The wound reopened, causing internal bleeding. He needs another surgery." Jenna's voice trembled slightly as she gripped her phone.

Relief was palpable on the other end of the line.

Liam crossed his arms, his dark eyes narrowing. "Your friend seems very concerned about you."

Jenna's fingers tightened around her phone. "What?"

"I said," Liam's lips curved slightly, "you're quite popular."

She forced a dry chuckle. "I guess."

Something in his tone made her wary.

His gaze dropped to the side of her face. "Shouldn't you get that ear checked?"

Jenna touched her swollen earlobe. "I can hear fine. It's probably nothing."

"If you don't examine it now, who will you blame if problems arise later?" His voice turned stern. "Come with me."

The words snapped her to attention. She followed silently.

At the registration desk, Liam efficiently handled everything on his phone. An ENT examination was quickly arranged.

He leaned against the wall outside the examination room, waiting. Thirty minutes later, Jenna emerged with a report.

"Tympanic congestion." She handed him the paper. "The doctor said it's minor."

Liam skimmed the results. "Get the prescribed medication and use it as directed."

They returned to the operating wing just as Ryan was wheeled out. Pale and groggy from anesthesia, he looked fragile.

When Ryan finally awoke in his hospital room, his first words were an apology. "Jenna, I'm so sorry..."

She gently squeezed his hand. "Don't be reckless next time."

The boy's eyes brimmed with guilt as he nodded.
###Chapter 393

Two hours later, Liam Hill called.

"The surgery is done. He's in the room next to Ryan's," Liam's steady voice came through the phone.

Jenna hung up and checked that Ryan was asleep before quietly stepping out.

The sharp scent of disinfectant hit her as she pushed open the neighboring door.

Liam stood by the bed. "How's Ryan?" he asked in a low voice.

"Fine." Jenna's gaze shifted to the patient. "And him?"

The man on the bed was awake, his face dark with fury.

When he saw Jenna, he thrashed violently, hatred burning in his eyes.

"You bitch! This isn't over!" he snarled through gritted teeth.

Jenna took two calm steps forward.

"Threatening someone in front of an officer?" She turned to Liam. "Officer Hill, what's the penalty for intimidation?"

"Detention," Liam replied coldly.

Jenna smirked. "Had to ruin your own life by trashing my stall. Got a death wish?"

Liam pulled out his notepad. "Name. Why did you vandalize the stall?"

The man turned his head away defiantly.

Only when Liam flashed his badge and warned him about obstructing justice did the man reluctantly speak.

"Leo Lombardi." He glared at Jenna. "She got my mom arrested and ruined my wife's business!"

Jenna's pupils contracted.

Lydia Lombardi's son.

No wonder he came after her.

Leo kept shouting, "These injuries are from those vendors! Arrest them!"

Liam shut his notepad. "Evidence?"

Leo froze, then exploded. "What evidence? You think she did this to me?"

"Evidence is required for charges," Liam said flatly. "No evidence, no case."

Leo tried to sit up but was pinned by his leg cast.

"Why won't you believe me?" he screamed hysterically.

Liam remained unmoved. "The law requires proof. Without it, anyone could accuse anyone."

Jenna cut in smoothly, "You're paying Ryan's medical bills."

"Never!" Leo's face twisted. "If he hadn't interfered—"

Jenna ignored him, turning to Liam. "Officer Hill, I'll leave the compensation matter to you."

Back in Ryan's room, she called Milo.

After a brief update, she hurried back to the night market.

Tanya and the others immediately surrounded her.

"Fractures and internal bleeding," Jenna said calmly. "But he brought it on himself."

The fruit vendor exhaled in relief. "You didn't mention us, right?"

"Don't worry." Jenna smiled slightly. "This stays between us."

The vendors finally relaxed.
###Chapter 394

Jenna Roland stared at the pile of dirty clothes Milo had sorted out, her brow furrowed. The garments were covered in dust and stains—unsellable now. She'd have to wash them for personal use.

That bastard Leo Lombardi had cost her hundreds again.

With her folding table broken under Leo's stomping feet, Jenna had to pack up early. She crouched down, methodically folding each item into the woven bag while calculating tomorrow's expenses—a new wooden board for her stall was essential.

Her steps slowed outside a used car dealership.

"How much for the minivan?"

"Not bad—just over thirty grand. Only a year old." The owner answered around his cigarette, disinterested.

A new one wouldn't cost much more. Jenna scoffed, adjusting her heavy bags before trudging home.

The moment she crossed the threshold, she dropped the bundles and collapsed onto the couch, gasping. Sweat trickled down her temples, her back drenched.

After thirty minutes, she suddenly stood and left again.

She didn't head for the market. Instead, she went straight to the auto dealership.

By dusk, a gleaming silver minivan sat parked below their apartment building.

Jenna ran her fingers over the steering wheel, lips curling upward. Though unregistered, this vehicle would revolutionize her vending business.

On the way back, she picked up a replacement board and stopped by the fishmonger for a live carp and fresh greens.

Golden sunset rays gilded their kitchen when she returned.

......

The aroma of home cooking greeted Ethan Roscente as he opened the door.

The tangy sweetness of sweet-and-sour fish mingled with sautéed vegetables, making his mouth water involuntarily.

"You're back?" Jenna emerged with two rice bowls. "Wash up for dinner."

When Ethan returned from washing his hands, she was ladling soup. Her damp hair, tied in a high ponytail, indicated a recent shower.

"Closed shop early today?" He accepted the chopsticks she offered.

"Bought a car." She deposited a piece of fish in his bowl. "Took your advice—didn't go used."

Ethan's eyebrow arched. "You can drive?"

"Who do you think you're looking down on?" Jenna tilted her chin up. "My license predates yours."

"Really?" Ethan suddenly leaned in, warm breath grazing her ear. "Then why don't you... show me what you've got?"

Heat flooded Jenna's ears. She rapped his knuckles with her chopsticks. "Can't even eat without running your mouth!"

Ethan's low laughter sparkled in his eyes like scattered starlight.
###Chapter 395

A cold smile curled at the corners of Liu Ruyan's lips. "Third Sister, you swear? Many people in this world make deadly oaths. How many actually suffer the consequences?"

Her gaze locked onto Liu Hongxing's eyes, her voice soft yet carrying undeniable authority. "After all these years, I can guess your schemes with my eyes closed."

Liu Hongxing's pupils gradually lost focus.

"Who exactly is that old woman?" Liu Ruyan pressed.

"My father's birth mother," Liu Hongxing answered mechanically. "She's been coming to our house since I can remember. After Grandma passed, she moved in permanently. Dad said she was just a hired caretaker."

Liu Ruyan's eyes glinted. "What's your father's real name? Where is the old woman from? Does she have other family?"

"She calls him Liu Ergou. No idea about her hometown—never been there."

"On the seventh night after Grandma's funeral, who pushed me down the stairs?" Liu Ruyan finally voiced the question buried deep within her.

"It was Dad's plan," Liu Hongxing said tonelessly. "He told you about the ghost visitation ritual on purpose. He had Second Brother and me tie ropes across the stairs and scatter marbles and banana peels."

Liu Ruyan's heart clenched. "I'd already agreed to go to the countryside. Why try to kill me?"

"The villa was in your name. Grandma's will stated it would only pass to us if you died."

"Was Gao Hongxia part of your scheme too?"

"Dad paid her five hundred yuan to replace someone else and get assigned to your work team."

Liu Ruyan smirked. Gao Hongxia had ruined her life for five hundred yuan—she must be drowning in regret now.

After extracting every answer, Liu Ruyan guided Liu Hongxing back to bed. Watching the peacefully sleeping Liu Hongying, she sighed softly. Sometimes ignorance truly was bliss. Liu Hongying's simple-mindedness had spared her from this web of filth.

Leaving the Liu residence, Liu Ruyan headed straight for People's Hospital. Tian Gui'e lay stiff as a mummy in her deserted hospital room.

After administering a sedative, Liu Ruyan transported the unconscious woman into her secret space. The white wolf curiously tapped its paw against Tian's chest—

"YOWCH!"

Tian jolted upright, only to faint again at the sight of a giant wolf muzzle inches from her face.

"Silver Moon, was that on purpose?" Liu Ruyan stifled a laugh.

The wolf pouted. I was just inspecting this strange creature.

"You're a wolf. Of course people faint when they see you."

Says the girl who trembled like a leaf when we first met, Silver Moon thought smugly, though aloud it praised, "Few possess your courage."

Amused, Liu Ruyan admitted, "I was terrified too at first."

Her gaze shifted to the unconscious Tian Gui'e. Now to pry more secrets from this woman's lips.
###Chapter 396

Jenna grabbed a towel and rushed into the kitchen, her trembling fingers wrapping around Ethan's bloodied hand. Warm crimson seeped through the fabric, staining her palm with a vivid red.

"You need the hospital!" Her voice shook with urgency.

Ethan glanced at his bandaged left hand, oddly pleased by the timing of this injury. The glistening tears in Jenna's eyes sent warmth through his chest, turning pain into sweet torment.

"It's really nothing—"

"Shut up!" She yanked him toward the door with surprising strength.

A rusty minivan waited at the alley's entrance, its door screeching in protest. Ethan hesitated—the battered vehicle stood in stark contrast to his usual Maybach.

"Get in!" Jenna revved the engine, black smoke puffing from the exhaust.

The moment his seatbelt clicked, the van lurched forward. Through the rearview mirror, he saw her biting her lower lip hard enough to draw blood. At that moment, he wouldn't mind dying in a crash.

Fluorescent lights glared in the ER. When the nurse peeled back the blood-soaked towel, Jenna gasped—a jagged wound spanned his entire palm, tiny porcelain shards embedded in the torn flesh.

"A bowl did this?" The doctor adjusted his glasses skeptically.

Antiseptic fumes filled the air, but Ethan only watched Jenna's white-knuckled grip on the chair. She trembled as if the injury were her own.

"Will it scar?" Her whisper barely carried over the suturing sounds.

The doctor didn't look up. "Depends on aftercare. But..." His gaze flicked to Ethan's elegant fingers. "Such beautiful hands. What a shame."

Suddenly Ethan clasped Jenna's hand with his bloody right one. "That painter you like—exhibition next month at the gallery." A pause. "Come with me?"

Her tears finally fell, mingling with drying blood on his skin.
###Chapter 397

Dr. Nathan Watson carefully stitched up Ethan Roscente's wound and wrapped it in pristine white bandages.

"Keep the wound dry. Change the dressing every three days." He adjusted his glasses. "Drink plenty of water and rest."

Ethan gave a noncommittal grunt, grabbing Jenna Roland's hand to leave.

The hospital lobby buzzed with activity.

Jenna suddenly stopped walking.

Officer Liam Hill approached in his police uniform, accompanied by his colleague Dr. Cole Macmillan.

"Officer Hill." Jenna smiled in greeting. "Still at the hospital?"

Liam's gaze lingered on Ethan before shifting to Jenna. "And this is?"

"Her husband." Ethan spoke first, tightening his grip on Jenna's hand. "Officer Hill, I presume? Heard a lot about you."

Jenna shot Ethan a glare.

Liam's expression darkened. "So Ms. Roland is already married."

"Yes." Jenna forced an awkward laugh. "Here on a case, Officer?"

"Brought in an injured suspect for treatment." Liam's tone remained neutral.

After brief pleasantries, Jenna quickly pulled Ethan away.

Cole nudged Liam with his elbow. "Smitten?"

Liam averted his gaze. "Any man would admire a beautiful, sensible woman."

"Too bad you're late." Cole teased. "Her husband doesn't seem like someone to trifle with."

Liam didn't respond.

The man was undeniably striking. Standing beside Jenna, they looked like a painting.

"Let's go pay the bill." He turned toward the counter.

Inside the car.

Ethan stared at the passing scenery. "How do you know that Officer Hill?"

"When Milo got into that fight at the police station." Jenna focused on driving. "He also handled the incident when Leo Lombardi vandalized our stall."

Ethan tapped his fingers against his knee. "What a coincidence."

"I called the police the first time." Jenna explained. "Aunt Tanya reported the second incident. He's been helpful."

Ethan let out a cold laugh.

"When I pushed Lydia Lombardi, all the vendors testified for me." Jenna continued. "This time with Leo's injury, if not for Officer Hill—"

"No one helps without reason." Ethan cut her off sharply. "There's always an ulterior motive."

Jenna's grip on the steering wheel tightened.

The air in the car turned icy.
###Chapter 398

Jenna kept her eyes on the road, her tone calm. "He probably likes me, but I'm not sure. Now that you've made our relationship clear, he should back off."

She sighed inwardly. If Liam truly gave up, she wouldn't be able to ask for his help when in trouble again.

Oh well. She couldn't keep taking advantage of his feelings.

That would be unfair.

From now on, she'd keep things strictly professional.

Ethan gazed out the window at the blur of pedestrians rushing past.

Suddenly, he spoke. "If you meet a better man than me someday, would you leave?"

Jenna burst out laughing. "Don't be ridiculous! We've known each other so long that I've memorized all your quirks. Starting over with someone new would be exhausting!"

"Besides, what man could possibly outshine you? I'm not some naive girl who falls for sweet talk. I prefer substance—someone strong, reliable, responsible, financially stable, and actually helpful when it counts."

"Hmm?" Ethan arched a brow, the tension in his face easing into a smirk. "Substance? So I'm just a tool to you?"

Jenna shot him a glare. "Don't twist my words! Marriage is about mutual support. Good looks alone are useless. Kindness needs to translate into action."

"I'm both kind and committed to this family," Ethan stated bluntly.

"So you've got nothing to worry about. I'd never leave."

Jenna maintained steady control of the wheel. When another driver cut her off, she rolled down the window and cursed. The offender swallowed his anger upon seeing a woman behind the wheel.

Back home, Jenna said, "Rest up. I'll do the dishes."

"Okay." Ethan obediently settled on the sofa.

After cleaning the kitchen, she found him watching TV. "I'm going to shower."

"Okay." His tone remained gentle.

Fresh from her bath and skincare routine, Jenna approached him. "Your turn."

Ethan raised his bandaged right hand with a roguish grin. "Doctor's orders—no water contact."

"Oh." Jenna deadpanned. "Then wait till it heals."

He frowned. "We share a bed. Won't you mind the stink?"

She blinked innocently. "I like your natural musk."

Ethan was rendered speechless.

He tried again. "I shower daily. Can't sleep otherwise. Get my drift?"

Jenna dropped the act and nodded sweetly. "Got it. You want me to take you to a public bathhouse, right?"
###Chapter 399

Jenna saw right through Ethan's little game.

His intentions were practically written across his face.

He just wanted her to help him bathe.

She decided to play dumb instead.

"I really don't know what you're talking about." Jenna blinked her innocent doe eyes, fluttering her lashes.

Ethan narrowed his gaze and grabbed her collar.

"Playing dumb?"

He leaned in close, his warm breath brushing against her neck.

"My hand is injured. You're helping me shower tonight."

Jenna shrank back.

"No!"

She refused firmly. "Men and women shouldn't be so intimate."

Ethan chuckled lowly.

"We share the same bed. What boundaries are left?"

Jenna pried his hand off and tried to bolt.

The next second, the world spun.

She landed in his lap, her cheeks instantly burning.

"You—"

"I'm injured." Ethan gave her a pitiful look.

Jenna turned her face away.

"Missing one shower won't kill you."

His gaze dropped to her flushed lips.

His thumb grazed them lightly.

"So soft..."

Jenna shuddered.

"Pervert!"

She shoved him away and darted off like a startled rabbit.

Ethan watched her retreating figure, his chest shaking with laughter.

This girl—her flustered reactions were adorable.

His phone suddenly rang.

"Speak."

"Mr. Roscente, the East Glory Group proposed a marriage alliance..."

Ethan lit a cigarette and exhaled a slow stream of smoke.

"Felix Savigny's daughter?"

He smirked. "She's not even worthy."

On the other end, Lucas nearly fell out of his chair.

"Y-You're married?"

"None of your business."

Ethan stubbed out the cigarette, his gaze softening as it drifted toward the bedroom.
###Chapter 400

Lucas's Adam's apple bobbed visibly.

He collapsed into his office chair like a puppet with its strings cut.

Ethan Roscente was married?

As the CEO's personal assistant of five years, how could he have been completely unaware?

The secrecy was beyond impressive.

His phone suddenly vibrated in his palm.

Lucas nearly jumped out of his skin.

"Felix Savigny" flashed across the screen.

"Good afternoon, Chairman Savigny."

"Lucas, any updates on our lunchtime discussion?"

Lucas forced a professional smile. "My apologies, but Mr. Roscente is already married."

"What?!" Felix's voice spiked through the receiver. "Since when?"

A titan like Ethan getting married should have sent shockwaves through the business world.

Especially since the Savignys and Roscentes were old family friends.

"I don't have details. Mr. Roscente just confirmed it himself."

Lucas hastily ended the call and exhaled sharply.

In the Savigny mansion, Felix's hand trembled around his phone.

"What's wrong?" His wife Audrey looked up in concern.

Their daughter Cecilia set down her scrolling device.

"Ethan Roscente is married!" Felix slammed his palm on the sofa armrest.

Audrey gasped. "That's impossible!"

Cecilia bit her lip. "Dad, is he just brushing us off?"

Felix immediately dialed Grandpa Harrison Roscente.

With the Savigny Group's cash flow crisis, this marriage alliance was supposed to be their lifeline.

"Harrison, I heard Ethan got married?"

"Yes, the registration was finalized a while back. Just waiting on the wedding ceremony."

Felix shot to his feet. "Which family's daughter?"

He needed to know who had stolen this opportunity right from under the Savignys' noses.
###Chapter 401

"She's not from a prestigious family, just an ordinary girl." Grandpa Harrison Roscente's hearty laughter came through the phone. "Though her background is modest, this girl has remarkable resilience. Quite endearing."

Felix Savigny's brow furrowed. "An ordinary family?"

"Yes. Her parents passed away early, and now she lives with her younger brother." Grandpa Harrison's tone remained cheerful. "We'll invite you to the wedding celebration. I must go now—another meeting awaits."

After hanging up, Felix turned to Audrey and Cecilia Savigny with a grim expression. "Ethan Roscente has indeed registered his marriage. To a girl with no connections whatsoever. How could the Roscentes allow this? They've lost their minds!"

Audrey gasped, covering her mouth. "Ethan married a commoner? Impossible!"

"If only I knew the reason!" Felix massaged his temples in frustration.

Cecilia bit her lip, her voice trembling. "Dad, if I can't marry Ethan, the Roscentes won't help us. With the company's broken capital chain, we're finished without their support!"

A cold glint flashed in Audrey's eyes. "Did the old man mention the girl's name?"

"No." Felix shook his head.

"Then we'll find out." Audrey's voice turned icy. "Once we locate that woman, we'll make her leave Ethan willingly."

The Savigny Group teetered on the brink of collapse. Only the wealthy Roscentes could save them now. This was the legacy of generations—if it crumbled under Felix's watch, he'd never face his ancestors in the afterlife.

Cecilia fretted. "Mom, they're already married. If Ethan truly loves her, even if she agrees to divorce, he won't."

"We won't know until we try." Audrey squeezed her daughter's hand. "Cecilia, don't you remember your childhood promise to Ethan? You vowed to be his bride. This is your chance. Your father and I will make it happen."

No one knew Cecilia's heart belonged to another—her boyfriend, a graphic designer at an ad agency. Though his salary barely covered rent, he'd shown her real love. The arranged marriage had filled her with resistance.

Now Ethan's sudden wedding brought unexpected relief. She could only hope his love for that girl was genuine—so she wouldn't be forced into the Roscente family.

......

"Achoo—"

In the living room, Ethan sneezed three times in succession.

Jenna Roland had just ended a client call when she heard the commotion. Peeking around the doorframe, she asked, "Catching a cold?"

Ethan gave her a pitiful look. "I'm heartbroken."

"What nonsense?" Jenna frowned.

"You won't bathe me." He stepped closer, eyes brimming with accusation.

"...Drop dead!" Jenna rolled her eyes and slammed the door shut.
###Chapter 402

Jenna leaned against the headboard, her fingers swiping rapidly across her phone screen.

Ethan stood by the bed and sighed deeply. "Someone's being rather heartless."

Jenna didn't look up, continuing to scroll through short videos.

Seeing her indifference, Ethan grabbed his pajamas and headed for the bathroom.

Suddenly remembering the doctor's warning, Jenna bolted upright. She glared at the bathroom door, her brow furrowed.

"Ethan!" She rushed to the bathroom entrance. "The doctor said your wound can't get wet! Are you insane?"

The door swung open.

Ethan stood there wearing only black boxer briefs, water droplets trailing down his defined abs. He braced one arm against the doorframe, smirking at her.

Jenna's gaze involuntarily dropped.

Eight perfectly sculpted abdominal muscles, with the hint of a V-line leading downward. Her ears burned instantly.

"Running away?" Ethan yanked her into the bathroom and locked the door behind them.

Pinned against the tiled wall, Jenna was engulfed by his masculine scent.

"Since you're here," Ethan murmured against her ear, his breath warm, "why not help me wash my back?"

Jenna covered her flushed face. "Y-you're going too far!"

"Too far?" His low chuckle vibrated against her skin. "Who was the one who came knocking?"

The cramped space filled with steam. Jenna could hear her own heartbeat pounding in her ears.

"I just..." Her voice trembled. "I didn't want your wound to get infected..."

Ethan suddenly released her, his expression softening. "Go to bed."

Jenna hesitated.

"If you don't leave now," Ethan narrowed his eyes, "I'll make you stay."

Jenna fled.

Even lying in bed, the image of his sculpted, dripping-wet torso refused to leave her mind.
###Chapter 403

Ethan stood wearing only black boxer briefs, his sculpted physique on full display.

The defined ridges of his abs gleamed like honey under the light, utterly mesmerizing.

Jenna stared at his torso, her mind drifting to forbidden places.

She remembered those late-night movies she'd secretly watched under the covers.

Despite watching several, her lack of real-world experience left her imagination wanting.

Her gaze involuntarily traveled lower, and her cheeks suddenly burned.

With a body like that, the experience must be incredible.

Ethan emerged from the closet in pajamas to find Jenna grinning at the ceiling.

Her flushed face and dazed eyes betrayed her scandalous thoughts.

"What's on your mind?" He snapped his fingers before her eyes.

Jenna startled, meeting his knowing smirk. Panic set in.

"N-nothing!"

Ethan crossed his arms, looking down at her. "That blush says otherwise."

She nearly choked on her own saliva.

How did he read her so easily?

Rolling away, she faced the wall. "I'm going to sleep!"

His low chuckle followed him out. When he returned from a phone call, Jenna was still scrolling on her phone.

The moment he lay down, she flinched away like a startled rabbit.

"Running?" His long arm hooked around her waist, pulling her flush against him.

Her back pressed to his chest, every contour unmistakable through the thin fabric.

"Let me go!" Her voice trembled.

Ethan's breath tickled her ear. "Why so jumpy?"

"I'll sleep on the couch!" She squirmed.

His arm tightened. "Keep wriggling. See what happens."

Jenna froze instantly.

Then the world spun as he pinned her beneath him.
###Chapter 404

Jenna's pupils constricted like a startled fawn. She writhed violently beneath Ethan, her legs kicking wildly as if he were a predator about to devour her.

Ethan clamped down on her slender wrists. Jenna went completely still, reduced to futile struggles like a beached fish.

"We may be legally married, but I was forced into this!" Her voice trembled. "I'll call the police if you don't stop!"

Ethan chuckled darkly, his smoldering gaze pinning her. "You're always overthinking things. Don't you want to experience it for yourself?"

"No!" Jenna's cheeks burned crimson like ripe cherries. "I'm warning you—don't you dare!"

"Women always say the opposite of what they mean." His breath scorched her neck as he whispered against her ear.

Jenna shuddered. "Milo is right next door! What if he hears—"

"Then stay quiet." Ethan traced her fevered cheek. "Unless...you want him to hear?"

"You—" Her eyes welled up, voice breaking. "I'm scared..."

"Don't be." He kissed her trembling lashes. "I'll be gentle."

Months of marriage without even a kiss. Jenna recalled her friend's warning: men who abstain too long stray easily. Since they were already wed, perhaps she shouldn't refuse anymore.

"Then...be gentle." The concession came in a whisper.

Ethan's gaze darkened, zeroing in on her bitten lips. His Adam's apple bobbed before he claimed that rosy mouth.

Jenna stiffened at first, but his skilled kiss soon melted her resistance. Her clumsy response accidentally nipped his tongue.

"Ah—" He hissed in pain but laughed low. "Little fool."

The endearment burned her ears. Before she could protest, another searing kiss silenced her.

......

When the storm passed, Ethan reluctantly broke the kiss. Cradling her close, his voice turned gravelly. "I'll cherish only you in this lifetime."

Jenna's flushed face abruptly cooled. "Cheat on me, and I'll castrate you."

Ethan blinked before chuckling into her hair. "That brutal?"

"Do you know how important a woman's first time is?" She fisted his collar, eyes blazing. "Betray me, and you'll lose everything down there."
###Chapter 405

Ethan Roscente immediately sobered when he saw Jenna Roland's suddenly serious expression.

He met her gaze directly and solemnly raised his right hand. "I, Ethan Roscente, swear that if I ever fail you, may heaven strike me down."

Jenna snorted and pulled his hand down. "Enough already. I'm going to shower."

"What about me?" Ethan asked seriously. "Want to shower together?"

"Dream on!" Jenna's ears turned pink. "I'll get a wet towel. You can clean yourself."

She quickly slipped into her nightgown and fled the room.

Ethan threw back the covers. The stark red stain on the sheets made his breath catch.

So she really had been a virgin.

No wonder she'd resisted so fiercely, so terrified, crying from the pain.

The memory of that night at the hotel flashed through his mind—how close Oliver Macmillan had come to taking her.

His fists clenched involuntarily, knuckles turning white.

That bastard had almost ruined her.

And he would pay for it. Soon.

Ethan pulled on his pajama pants and walked bare-chested into the living room.

As he lit a cigarette, Milo Roland peeked out from his room.

"Mr. Roscente..." The teenager hesitated. "Can we talk?"

Ethan exhaled a smoke ring. "Come here."

Milo adjusted his collar and approached.

"There's a class gathering this Saturday. Ryan Watson and I are both going." Milo rubbed his hands together. "I'm worried about Jenna working the stall alone—"

"I'll go." Ethan stubbed out the cigarette. "And call me brother-in-law from now on."

Milo's eyes widened.

He knew exactly what that title meant.

"Brother-in-law." The boy's voice was clear.

"Did she get hit?" Ethan asked abruptly.

Milo nodded. "A slap."

Ethan's gaze turned icy. Milo wisely retreated to his room.

Jenna emerged drying her hair, frowning at the cigarette butt in the ashtray. "Post-sex smoke? How indulgent."

"You know a lot." Ethan pulled her into his arms.

"Let go!" Jenna struggled free and hurried into the bedroom, her face flushing when she saw the sheets.

She turned and shoved Ethan. "Out. I need to change these."
###Chapter 406

Ethan Roscente stood at the bedroom doorway, his gaze fixed on the glaring red stain on the sheets. His Adam's apple bobbed, dark currents swirling in his eyes.

Jenna Roland frantically tugged at the blanket to cover it.

"Don't move." He strode forward, grasping her slender wrist. "I'll handle it."

The tips of Jenna's ears burned as her fingers unconsciously twisted the hem of her nightgown.

Ethan deftly stripped the bloodied sheets, his movements gentle as though handling something precious. He turned to retrieve fresh linens from the closet, fingertips brushing over the crisp cotton fabric.

"I can do it myself..." Jenna reached out.

"Stay put." His tone brooked no argument, yet his hands remained tender.

After replacing the sheets, Ethan leaned down to tuck the blanket around her. Moonlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting delicate patterns across her face.

"Ethan..." Her voice was barely a whisper.

He suddenly bent closer, his lips grazing her burning earlobe. "Thank you for becoming mine."

Jenna burrowed deeper under the covers, only her flushed cheeks visible.

"If you dare betray me..." She glared fiercely, though her eyes shimmered with unshed tears.

Ethan chuckled, pulling her—blanket and all—into his arms. "As you command, Mrs. Roscente."

Three days later, at a night market stall.

Ryan Watson's forehead bandage had been removed, leaving only a faint scar. He stood awkwardly beside Milo Roland, nervously twisting the hem of his shirt.

"Sis." Milo yanked Ryan forward. "This idiot insisted on helping out before finishing his meds."

Jenna handed over a thermos. "Take your medicine first."

Ryan cradled the cup, steam fogging his glasses. He suddenly looked up. "Will those people...come back?"

"Who cares!" Milo punched his shoulder. "Brother-in-law's coming tomorrow. Let's see who dares cause trouble!"

Jenna's hand jerked, nearly knocking over the sugar jar. Ever since that night, the title "brother-in-law" sent her pulse racing.

"Leo Lombardi got fifteen days in detention." She changed the subject. "Next time they cause trouble, we'll call the police directly."

Ryan nodded, but his eyes darkened behind his glasses.

Top floor of HM Group headquarters, Ethan shattered his third coffee cup.

"Mr. Roscente?" Assistant Lucas peeked through the door.

Ethan grabbed his suit jacket, frost crystallizing in his gaze. "Get the car ready."

The hallway lights elongated his cold, imposing silhouette, the temperature plunging in his wake. Lucas shrank back, not daring to ask another question.
###Chapter 407

The derelict chemical plant on the outskirts of Los Angeles stood silent, its crumbling walls veined with moss. Faint light seeped through shattered windows, painting the concrete floor in jagged stripes.

A thick layer of dust coated the ground. In the corner, a man writhed inside a burlap sack. His Armani suit was soiled, nylon ropes biting into his wrists. The once-glossy leather shoes had dulled to a lifeless sheen.

Four black-clad bodyguards stood like statues, the air thick with tension.

The iron door screeched open.

Ethan Roscente stepped inside, his Oxford shoes gleaming. The black dress shirt clung to his broad shoulders and tapered waist. Platinum cufflinks caught the dim light, mirroring the ice in his gaze.

"Mr. Roscente." The bodyguards bowed in unison.

He stopped before Howard Wen. Slowly, he peeled off his gloves. The sack was yanked away, revealing Howard's ashen face.

"Wake him."

Ice water cascaded over Howard's head. He gasped awake, coughing violently—only to meet Ethan's abyssal stare. His entire body trembled, dark stains spreading down his trousers.

"You promised to spare me!"

Ethan's lips curved. The cigar between his fingers glowed crimson. "I did." Smoke curled around his sharp jawline. "But I never said there wouldn't be consequences."

Howard's pupils contracted.

The first punch landed with a sickening crack. His scream echoed through the empty factory, sending crows scattering from the windows.

"Do you know what Jenna Roland's virginity was worth?" Ethan ground his heel into Howard's twisted fingers. Bones crunched. "Ten of your family fortunes couldn't cover it."

Howard spat blood, begging through split lips. His swollen eyelids fluttered as Ethan accepted a baseball bat from a bodyguard.

The last thing he saw was cold metal flashing in the dim light.
###Chapter 408

"Mr. Roscente, I swear I've learned my lesson!" Howard Ho sobbed uncontrollably, his voice trembling. "I'll stay far away from Miss Roland from now on!"

Ethan Roscente looked down at him with icy disdain.

"Did you buy Jenna from Victor Roland?"

Howard froze for a second before nodding frantically like a dog. "Yes! But later I had Victor and his men tied up and beaten!"

The ember of Ethan's cigarette glowed faintly in the dim light.

"Here's your chance at redemption." He exhaled a slow stream of smoke. "Get Victor's orchard transferred to Jenna."

Howard shuddered violently.

"Can you do it?" Ethan's voice was feather-light yet suffocating.

"Yes!" Howard answered without hesitation.

Ethan crushed the cigarette, sparks flying.

"Succeed, and all is forgiven." He turned to leave. "Fail, and you're a dead man."

Howard collapsed to the ground, only daring to breathe after Ethan disappeared from view.

He glared viciously at Xavier Valdemar. "Untie me now, you idiot!"

Xavier clenched his fists, but remembering Howard's brother was the deputy mayor, swallowed his anger.

Once freed, Howard groaned in pain. He pulled out his phone and dialed.

"Brother! Ethan Roscente's men kidnapped me!" he wailed. "Send help immediately!"

His brother, Howard Ho Sr., sounded shocked on the other end.

After hearing the details, Howard Sr. let out a long exhale.

"Do as he says." His voice was grim. "Send your location. I'm dispatching a team now."

......

Seven days later.

Jenna Roland was busy at her street stall when her phone rang.

"Jenna! You scheming bitch!" Victor's voice exploded through the receiver. "Did you send someone to sabotage my orchard?"

Jenna's grip tightened until her knuckles turned white.

"Bad reception at the crematorium?" she sneered. "Got a new number?"

"That orchard is mine!" Victor shrieked hysterically. "You'll never take it!"

Jenna's eyes narrowed.

Something happened to the orchard?

"It belonged to my father first." She enunciated each word. "A thief like you doesn't deserve to call anything 'mine'."

"It's under my name now!" Victor roared. "No matter who you send, I'll die before handing it over!"
###Chapter 409

Jenna Roland's knuckles turned white as she gripped her phone. Victor Roland's curses screeched through the receiver.

"That orchard was never meant to be yours!"

"You bitch! Your whole family should die!"

Jenna smirked. "I'll return those words to you. Victor, you're the one who deserves an early grave."

She ended the call with a sharp swipe of her finger.

Milo Roland looked up from his phone. "What's Victor ranting about now?"

"Trouble at the orchard." Jenna tossed her phone onto the market stall. "He thinks I'm behind it."

Ryan Watson leaned closer. "What kind of trouble?"

Jenna checked the time. Lunch hour approached. She stood. "Hungry? I'll grab us some food."

Ryan's eyes lit up. "Starving." He scratched his head sheepishly. "Only had water this morning."

Jenna understood. Since his parents' divorce, the boy often skipped breakfast.

"Wait here." She grabbed her wallet and left.

The aroma of cooked food wafted from nearby restaurants. Jenna ordered three dishes and soup, paid, and returned.

Soon, steaming containers arrived. Jenna unfolded a new collapsible table and waved the boys over.

"Tanya, join us?" She called to the neighboring stall.

Tanya Hill shook her head. "You go ahead."

Jenna picked up her chopsticks when her phone rang again. Ethan Roscente's name flashed on screen. Her lips curved unconsciously.

"Eating now," she said brightly. "You?"

Ethan's deep voice rumbled through the line. "Was hoping to take you to lunch."

"Next time." She speared a piece of braised pork. "I'll cook for you tonight."

"Don't just make my favorites." He paused. "Cook something you like too."

After hanging up, Jenna took two bites before another unknown number called.

She frowned at the screen. Not Victor. Who then?

"Hello, who's this?"
###Chapter 410

"Miss Roland, this is Howard Wen." The voice on the phone was both familiar and strange.

Jenna's fingers tightened instantly, her nails digging into her palms. She'd recognize that voice anywhere—even in death.

"You dare call me?" Her tone could freeze hell.

"Please don't be angry." Howard's voice oozed appeasement. "I've reclaimed your parents' orchard from your uncle. When would be convenient to transfer the deed?"

Jenna froze.

"What did you say?" She couldn't believe her ears.

"I knew your uncle seized the property, so I retrieved it for you." Howard explained. "Consider it... an apology for past wrongs."

A cold laugh escaped her. "Since when did you grow a conscience?"

"I genuinely want to make amends." Sincerity dripped from his words. "Three o'clock this afternoon at the Land Resources Bureau?"

"Fine." She hung up without ceremony.

Turning to Milo, her eyes blazed with intensity. "We're getting the orchard back!"

"Who helped?" Milo frowned.

"An... acquaintance." She evaded. "We're finalizing the paperwork this afternoon."

As Milo opened his mouth to press further, Jenna was already mapping out plans. "Once we have the orchard, I'm quitting the clothing business!"

"What about all this inventory?" He gestured at the mountain of garments.

"Sell what we can." Her smile reached her eyes. "I'll wear the rest myself!"

She discreetly texted Ethan. Joy aside, she hadn't forgotten Howard's true nature.

Ethan replied instantly: 【I'll go with you.】

At 2:30 PM, Jenna arrived early outside the government building. The early spring wind carried a chill, yet her skin burned with anticipation.

"Waiting long?" Ethan's voice brushed her ear.

Before she could turn, strong arms pulled her into a warm embrace. His lips grazed the corner of her mouth.

"People are watching!" Flustered, she pushed him away, cheeks flaming.

Ethan chuckled, tightening his grip on her shoulder. "Let them."

Sheltered against his chest, her heartbeat thundered. Eyes fixed on the intersection, she awaited the man who held her future in his hands—equal parts hope and trepidation coursing through her veins.
###Chapter 411 

Jenna Roland had always prided herself on being fearless. But today, under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Ethan Roscente kissed her until her cheeks burned crimson.

"Have you lost your mind?" she hissed through gritted teeth, fingers clutching the hem of her blouse.

Ethan chuckled, his warm breath brushing her earlobe. "What's wrong? Feeling shy?"

"There are people everywhere!" Jenna glared at him, the tips of her ears turning scarlet.

"Alright, alright. I'll be more careful next time." He pinched her cheek affectionately.

Before Jenna could retort, a black Audi pulled up beside them.

Wilson Parvis stepped out, his smile freezing when he spotted Ethan.

He swallowed hard and forced himself forward. "Miss Roland, Mr. Roscente. Sorry to keep you waiting."

Jenna noticed the bruise on his face and raised an eyebrow. "What happened to you?"

"Just... tripped and fell." Wilson stole a nervous glance at Ethan, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

Jenna nodded thoughtfully. "Let's go get the paperwork done."

Wilson trailed behind them like a frightened mouse, not daring to lift his head the entire time.

The process went smoothly. Outside the Land Resources Bureau, Jenna turned to Wilson. "Thanks for handling the orchard matter."

"My pleasure, truly." He waved his hands frantically.

Jenna's expression darkened. "But if I hear you're harassing women again—"

"I swear I won't!" Wilson backed away, hands raised in surrender.

As he scurried off, Jenna finally smiled. "My parents' orchard is finally back where it belongs."

Ethan watched her joyful expression with amusement. "What's next?"

"First, I'll clear out the remaining stock at the boutique. Then I'll visit the orchard." She rubbed her hands together. "This time, I'm keeping it safe."

"Call me if you need anything." He ruffled her hair. "Come on, I'll drive you home."

A mischievous glint appeared in Jenna's eyes. "What do you think about getting guard dogs for the orchard?"

Ethan laughed. "Whatever makes you happy."

Their shadows stretched long in the sunset. Jenna secretly slipped her hand into Ethan's, her heart full of contentment.
###Chapter 412

Jenna pointed at the white minivan parked by the roadside. "I drove here myself. Come home early this afternoon. I'll cook something delicious for you."

"Alright." Ethan's lips curved slightly, his deep eyes shimmering with warmth. His striking features glowed under the sunlight, drawing admiring glances from passersby.

Jenna's heart swelled with pride. A husband this handsome must have countless admirers. But she wasn't lacking either—she matched him perfectly.

"I'll head out now."

"Drive safely."

She slid into the driver's seat and fastened her seatbelt. Through the rearview mirror, she saw Ethan standing motionless, watching her leave. His tall figure only disappeared from view when her car turned the corner.

Ethan's smile faded as his usual composed demeanor returned. He drove straight to the office.

...

At 5 p.m., Jenna closed her stall early. Passing by the market, she invited Milo and Ryan to join her grocery shopping.

Their cart overflowed with ingredients—spare ribs for Ethan, braised fish for Milo, spicy chicken for Ryan. Only her own favorite dish was missing.

Back at Beverly Hills, the trio immediately got to work in the kitchen. Milo washed vegetables, Ryan prepped ingredients, while Jenna took charge of cooking. The sizzling wok filled the air with mouthwatering aromas.

Ethan arrived home promptly at six. Shrugging off his suit jacket and rolling up his sleeves, he helped arrange the dishes.

By 6:30, eight exquisite dishes covered the dining table. Milo and Ryan served rice, ushering everyone to their seats.

"Sis, why don't you head to the orchard tomorrow? We'll handle the clothing stall," Ryan suggested between bites.

"You two selling women's clothing?" Jenna paused her chopsticks, eyes twinkling.

"It's not lingerie." Ryan grinned. "Don't worry, we've got this."

Jenna burst out laughing. "Fine. Starting tomorrow, I'll deliver the goods and go straight to the orchard."

After dinner, when Jenna moved to clear the table, Ethan stopped her. "You've worked hard enough cooking." He glanced meaningfully at Milo.

Taking the hint, Milo practically pushed Jenna out of the kitchen before dragging Ryan in to wash dishes.

"Impressive!" Jenna gave Ethan a thumbs-up.

Amusement danced in Ethan's eyes as he guided her to the sofa. "Hire some help at the orchard. I don't like you working there alone."

The evening news played softly on TV. Jenna turned down the volume. "It's too early to hire workers when we're not making profits yet."
###Chapter 413

Ethan gripped Jenna's hand tightly, his brow furrowed. "Your uncle's family is trouble. Guard dogs won't cut it. I'll hire professional bodyguards—ex-military. They could handle Victor Roland's goons or even a whole gang without breaking a sweat."

Jenna fell silent.

Dogs could deter thieves, but if the Rolands came armed, a few canines would be useless.

Sometimes, the only language people like Victor understood was brute force.

"How much would bodyguards cost per month?"

"Friendship discount—two grand each."

"That cheap?" Jenna's eyes widened in disbelief.

Even food delivery drivers earned more than that, let alone skilled security personnel.

"They're not in it for the money. Just want something to do."

"But that's ridiculously low!"

"Leave it to me." Ethan pinched her cheek. "I'll cover their salaries."

"No!" She swatted his hand away. "I can't let you pay my employees!"

"I'm your husband."

"Still no!"

She refused to take advantage of him, especially when it involved multiple salaries.

"My monthly salary is fifty grand. This is nothing." He lowered his voice. "Keep arguing, and you won't sleep tonight."

"..."

Jenna's ears burned. "Are you threatening me?"

Ethan leaned in, his breath hot against her neck. "What do you think?"

She pushed him away in a fluster. "Milo and Ryan are right here!"

"So? Yes or no?"

Always cornered by him, Jenna stomped her foot. "Fine! Have it your way!"

Why was he so eager to throw money around?

Still, she tucked this gesture of care deep into her heart.

......

At dawn the next day, Jenna took Milo and Ryan to set up their street stall.

After settling them in, she drove alone to the orchard.

At the foot of the hill, she found the iron gate secured with a new lock.

Without a key, she simply picked up a rock and smashed it open.

Inside, the orchard sprawled before her—rows upon rows of fruit trees.

Apples, oranges, and pomegranates weighed down the branches, their bounty bending the limbs low.
###Chapter 414

The orchard gleamed with meticulous care under Victor Roland's stewardship. Each tree stood nourished by rich fertilizer, every inch of soil bearing witness to devoted cultivation.

Jenna Roland paused at the orchard's entrance, a cold smirk playing on her lips. Victor's prized orchard now belonged to her. She could almost picture him fuming with rage.

Villagers soon arrived for their daily work, confused by the locked gates they'd encountered earlier.

"Jenna, why was the orchard locked this morning?" An elderly woman with silver-streaked hair spoke first.

Jenna surveyed the crowd, her voice clear. "From today onward, I'm the owner of this orchard. Those who wish to stay are welcome. Those who leave won't be stopped."

A wave of murmurs erupted.

"This orchard was my parents' legacy. Victor stole it for years. Now justice is served." Jenna's tone left no room for debate.

Chester Kalmien stepped forward. "I've worked here since your parents' time. This orchard means everything to me. I'll stay if you'll have me."

"Taking back what's rightfully yours is only fair!" Fiona Garten declared, thumping her chest.

Darren Savigny raised his hand. "Count me in too."

To Jenna's surprise, every worker chose to remain. She immediately raised their daily wages from $100 to $150, sparking cheers.

"What needs doing today?" Jenna asked.

"Four western plots need weeding, and rotten fruit must be collected for compost," Darren replied.

Jenna nodded. "Get to work then." As the group dispersed, she trailed her fingers along the gnarled tree trunks during her solitary inspection.

Her phone rang. Ethan Roscente's name flashed on screen.

"I've arranged the men. Send the address." His baritone voice crackled through the receiver.

Within an hour of sharing her location, four broad-shouldered men in black shirts appeared at the orchard gates.

"Ethan sent you?" Jenna appraised them.

Vincent Roland, their leader, nodded. "You must be Ms. Roland."

"Did Ethan explain your pay and meals?"

"$2000 monthly, but you cover our food." In truth, they were Ethan's personal security, acting under orders.

"Agreed. I'll deliver meals daily," Jenna said briskly.

"And our duties?" Vincent inquired.

"Remove trespassers immediately. Not a single branch gets damaged." Her gaze hardened. "Night shifts required."

"We've brought gear for 24/7 rotations," Vincent assured.

Jenna checked her watch. "Start today. Exchange numbers for emergencies."

After swapping contacts, Jenna strode homeward, her silhouette cutting a defiant figure against the afternoon sun.
###Chapter 415

Jenna Roland carried a woven basket into the bustling farmers' market, expertly selecting fresh ingredients.

As she picked vegetables, she texted Ethan Roscente: "Coming home for lunch?"

His reply came quickly: "Client meeting. Eat without me."

A faint smile curved her lips as she read the message. She bought just enough for herself and smoothly checked out.

The aroma of cooking soon filled her kitchen. Four dishes and a soup were arranged on the dining table. Jenna savored her meal unhurriedly.

She pulled out newly purchased plastic containers, efficiently portioning the leftovers. These disposable utensils were specifically bought for meal deliveries.

"Sis, business was crazy today!" Milo Roland accepted the thermal lunchbox, face glowing with pride.

Jenna arched an eyebrow. "How much?"

"Over six hundred!" He flashed a thumbs-up. "Impressive, right?"

"Not bad." She pinched his cheek affectionately. "Eat up. I need to make a delivery."

Milo leaned in curiously. "Taking lunch to Ethan?"

"No." She shook her head. "The new security guards at the orchard. I promised them meals."

Grabbing the takeout bags, she turned to leave. Milo's voice followed her: "Be careful out there!"

Her car had just left the city limits when Vincent Roland called: "Miss Jenna, Victor Roland brought people here."

Her eyes turned icy. "Just as expected."

She pressed the accelerator, the vehicle speeding down the country road. In the distance, two groups faced off on the hillside.

Vincent gripped something in his hand that made the opposing group hesitate.

"Victor Roland!" Jenna strode forward, voice frosty. "This orchard belongs to me now. Dare to cause trouble again?"

Victor's face darkened with rage. Since losing the orchard to Ethan's schemes, sleepless nights had left him gaunt and haggard.

He hadn't wanted to come today, but the memory of being outmaneuvered ignited his fury, compelling him to drag relatives along for confrontation.
###Chapter 416

Victor Roland stood at the orchard gate, his face dark with rage. His burning glare locked onto Jenna Roland, fury radiating from his entire being.

"How did this orchard end up in your hands when it was clearly taken by Ethan Roscente?" he demanded through gritted teeth.

Jenna smirked dismissively, handing her lunchbox to her bodyguard Zachary Macmillan.

"Victor Roland, you dare ask me that?" Her voice was ice. "This was my parents' legacy. You stole it for years, and now it's rightfully returned. What gives you the right to question me?"

Veins bulged on Victor's forehead. His fists clenched until his knuckles cracked.

"Bullshit!" he roared. "You conspired with Ethan Roscente to scheme against me!"

Jason Roland and Sean Roland immediately chimed in.

"Exactly!" Jason jabbed a finger at Jenna's face. "A brat like you, resorting to dirty tricks!"

Jenna's sharp gaze swept over these so-called relatives.

"Uncle Jason. Uncle Sean." Her tone could freeze hell. "How much did Victor pay you to sell your dignity?"

Sean flushed with anger. "I'm your elder! Watch your tone!"

"Elder?" Jenna scoffed. "After my parents died, which one of you cared for Milo and me? Now you play the elder card?"

Whispers rippled through the gathered villagers.

"That orchard did belong to her parents..."
"Victor seized it for years. It's time it went back..."

Jason's bluster faltered visibly.

Jenna straightened, her voice ringing clear. "I never claimed a cent of the orchard's profits all these years—consider it repayment for his so-called 'charity.' But how did he repay me?"

Pain flickered in her eyes. "Beatings. Abuse. Treating me like a slave. Even trying to sell me off!"

The murmurs grew louder.

Victor, sensing the tide turning, barked, "Lies! That orchard belongs to me, or else—"

"Or else what?" Jenna met his glare unflinching. "Try selling me again?"

She addressed the crowd. "Let everyone here bear witness. Today, I declare—this orchard will never be stolen again!"

Victor trembled with impotent rage.

As Jenna turned to leave, she paused. "Oh, one more thing—I've hired a lawyer. We'll be suing for every penny of those stolen profits."

The statement detonated like a bomb.

Victor's face drained of all color.
###Chapter 417
Henry Roland sighed deeply and turned to Victor Roland.

"Big brother, this orchard was originally left by Jenna's parents. You've made enough profit managing it all these years. It's time to return it to its rightful owner."

Jiang Huajun nodded in agreement.

"Second brother is right. We can't keep something that doesn't belong to us in good conscience."

Victor's eyes widened in shock.

He had clearly bribed each of them with five hundred dollars to keep quiet. Yet here they were, betraying him without hesitation.

Not only was the orchard slipping through his fingers, but his money had gone to waste too. Furious, Victor stomped his feet and started hurling insults at them.

His brothers, who had previously sided with him, immediately fired back.

Outnumbered three to one, Victor quickly lost the argument.

Before leaving, he shot Jenna a venomous glare.

"Just you wait!"

Jiang Huajun's eyes flickered with guilt.

"We've wronged you and your brother all these years. We don't expect forgiveness, but we hope we won't be enemies when we meet again."

Jenna remained expressionless.

Did they really think a simple apology could erase years of deep-seated pain?

"Please leave."

Seeing her cold dismissal, Henry Roland and the others left awkwardly.

"The food is still warm," Jenna said to Vincent Roland and the others. "Please help yourselves."

"Thank you," Vincent replied, motioning for his companions to start eating.

Jenna walked to the edge of the orchard, studying the flimsy wire fence.

This kind of barrier wouldn't stop anyone determined to cause trouble.

She turned abruptly.

"Mr. Roland, what if we electrify the fence?"

Vincent swallowed his food and nodded approvingly.

"Excellent idea."

Jenna smiled faintly.

"I'll go check the hardware market. Enjoy your meal."

Once she was out of earshot, Vincent couldn't help but praise her.

"Miss Roland's cooking is exceptional."

"Way better than my mom's," Zachary Macmillan mumbled through a mouthful of rice.

Quentin Blanchet sighed.

"Mr. Roscente is truly fortunate."

Yves Deross grinned.

"I wouldn't mind working here permanently."

Vincent gave him a sidelong glance.

"That's up to Mr. Roscente."

"Given how much he values Miss Roland, he'll definitely let us stay," Yves said confidently.

Just then, Quentin dumped his leftover rice into the potato stir-fry plate.

"Are you insane?" Yves glared.

Zachary cursed.

"I wasn't done eating!"

Quentin grinned shamelessly.

"Should've eaten faster then."
###Chapter 418

Without hesitation, Zachary Macmillan dumped his rice into the stir-fried pork with lettuce.

Yves Deross was quicker, mixing his entire bowl into the scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

Vincent Roland slammed the table. "Are you insane? How am I supposed to eat now?"

Multiple chopsticks pointed at the lone bowl of seaweed egg drop soup.

Vincent's temple throbbed. He wanted to wring their necks.

Though Jenna Roland's cooking was indeed irresistible, their table manners were atrocious.

"Ethan Roscente is truly living the dream," Yves mumbled through a mouthful of food.

......

Jenna circled the flea market three times before finding a shop specializing in wrought iron fences.

"Bulk discount," the shop owner said around his cigarette, gesturing. "Measure first, then quote."

She left her number, emphasizing, "The entire orchard needs fencing."

The owner stubbed out his cigarette. "I'll send someone to measure this afternoon."

"I also want it electrified. Know any reliable electricians?"

The man grinned. "Lucky you. My younger brother specializes in that."

Jenna jotted down the number and dialed from her car.

"Safety guaranteed," the voice on the line promised. "Installed for hundreds with zero incidents."

Only then did she relax.

"I'll contact you once the fence is up."

The next day, returning from grocery shopping, she received the measurement call.

A quick WeChat transfer sealed the deal.

"Work starts today. Labor costs $200 per worker daily."

Tying on her apron, Jenna agreed.

Her daily routine never wavered: cooking, delivering meals, and supervising the work.

With Ethan attending a business dinner, she ate alone before heading out with the insulated lunchbox.

A hundred meters of steel mesh already stood at the orchard entrance, its sharp spikes glinting coldly in the sun.

"Slow down," she sighed, watching the workers devour their food.

Setting the lunchbox aside, Jenna rolled up her sleeves and joined the fruit tree pruning crew.
###Chapter 419

Jenna Roland was pruning branches in her orchard when her phone buzzed.

She pulled off her gloves and checked the screen. It was Milo calling.

"Hey sis, remember you promised to treat Dr. Melford to dinner? He's working at Los Angeles General Hospital now." Milo's voice bubbled with excitement.

Jenna tucked the phone between her shoulder and ear, continuing to trim. "Oh right, I totally forgot about that."

"I knew you would!" Milo laughed through the line.

"Fine, I'll call him tomorrow." She tossed the clipped branches into a basket. "But a busy surgeon like him probably won't have time."

"Just ask. You can always reschedule."

After hanging up, Jenna gazed at the fruit-laden trees, remembering how Dr. Melford had saved her brother during surgery.

The next morning after her farmers' market shift, Jenna sat in her car and dialed Liam Melford's number.

"Dr. Melford, this is Jenna Roland, Milo's sister." Her fingers tightened around the steering wheel.

A calm baritone responded, "I remember. What can I do for you?"

"I'd like to take you to dinner to thank you for Milo's surgery. He's made a full recovery."

To her surprise, Liam agreed immediately. "Sure. When?"

Jenna blinked. "How about 11:30 at Per Se?"

"Sounds good."

She immediately called Ethan Roscente after hanging up.

"I'm having lunch with Dr. Melford. Want to join us?" The engine purred to life as she spoke. "Didn't you say your colleague knows him?"

A pause. Then Ethan's deep voice came through, "You're sure you want me there?"

"Of course! The more the merrier." Jenna chuckled. "Per Se at 11:30."

After ending the call, Ethan pressed the intercom. "Raymond, come in."

A middle-aged man in a tailored suit entered promptly.

"You needed me, Mr. Roscente?"

Ethan leaned back in his leather chair, fingers drumming the desk. "Attend a lunch meeting with me today as my coworker."

Raymond looked baffled. "May I...ask why?"

"Don't ask unnecessary questions." Ethan's gaze turned icy. "Remember, today I'm just a regular HM Group employee."

Beads of sweat formed on Raymond's forehead as he nodded. "Understood. I'll prepare immediately."

When the door closed, Ethan picked up a photo frame from his desk—Jenna smiling among her orchard trees.
###Chapter 420

Documents piled high on the desk, each marked with an "Urgent" red tag. Ethan Roscente massaged his temples, twirling a fountain pen between his fingers.

His phone screen lit up—Jenna Roland's name flashed across it. He stared at the name for three seconds, Liam Melford's smug face flashing through his mind.

"See you tonight," he replied tersely, sliding the pen back into its holder.

At exactly eleven, Jenna called right on time. Ethan closed the final contract, signing his name with a flourish.

"Dylan, meet me downstairs," he said into the intercom.

During the thirty-second elevator descent, Ethan adjusted his tie in the mirror. The reflection showed a man with a furrowed brow, irritation flickering in his eyes.

A black Audi Q7 waited silently at the company's back entrance. Dylan Lawrence jogged over, his gaze lingering on the vehicle for a split second.

"Get in." Ethan pulled open the door.

Dylan hesitated, eyeing the empty driver's seat. The usual Rolls-Royce Phantom and chauffeur were conspicuously absent.

"Remember," Ethan rested one hand on the steering wheel, "today I'm your colleague."

Dylan swallowed hard. "Understood, Ethan."

Per Se's glass facade glittered under the sunlight. Ethan unbuttoned his suit jacket and dialed Jenna's number.

At the end of the fourth-floor corridor, Jenna waved at him in a pale blue dress. Ethan's lips curved upward involuntarily.

"Is Liam here?" He quickened his pace, scanning the private dining room behind her.

Dylan sucked in a sharp breath. He'd never seen the CEO wear such a gentle expression—it was like looking at a different person.

"And this is?" Jenna glanced curiously at Dylan.

Ethan stepped between them, blocking her outstretched hand. "He's germophobic."

Dylan nodded stiffly, a cold sweat breaking across his back. His boss's gaze sliced through him like a blade.

The clink of cutlery drifted from the private room. Ethan straightened his cuffs and pushed open the door, his perfect smile sliding into place.
###Chapter 421 

Jenna Roland pushed open the private room door. Ethan Roscente and Nathan Watson entered one after another.

Liam Melford and his assistant Zoe Macmillan were already seated. A table of exquisite dishes emitted tantalizing aromas, yet no one had touched their chopsticks.

"Dr. Melford, you're early." Nathan deliberately raised his voice with a bright smile.

Liam lifted his gaze calmly. "Just arrived."

Jenna motioned for them to sit and stood to pour wine. When she reached Ethan, his slender fingers covered his glass. "I have a meeting this afternoon."

"Understood." Jenna set down the bottle and picked up a juice glass. "Dr. Watson, thanks to your referral to Dr. Melford, my brother's surgery went so smoothly. Let me toast you both with tea."

Nathan hastily stood. "You're too kind, Ms. Roland. Mr. Roscente and I are old partners."

Liam raised his wine glass, his deep eyes resting on Jenna's face. "Just doing my job."

The crisp clink of glasses echoed. Nathan stole a glance at Ethan's expression. He swallowed the burning liquor, his heart pounding—would drinking during work hours cost him his bonus?

"Please, everyone, don't stand on ceremony. Dig in." Jenna warmly urged.

Hearing himself addressed last, Ethan's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly. He directly picked up a piece of steamed sea bass and placed it in Jenna's bowl.

Nathan's eyes widened, his chopsticks nearly slipping from his grasp.

Zoe couldn't resist asking, "Ms. Roland, are you two...?"

Under Ethan's scorching gaze, Jenna cleared her throat. "He's my husband."

Clatter—

Nathan's chopsticks hit the floor. He mechanically bent to retrieve them, his mind blank.

"Surprised, Dr. Watson?" Jenna offered him a fresh pair.

"O-of course!" Nathan stammered. "Out of all of us, only Mr. Roscente is married..."

Liam ate quietly, as if deaf to the conversation.

When Nathan took the chopsticks, Ethan's icy stare sent chills down his spine. He wished he could vanish—had he known this would be such a battlefield, he'd never have come!

Midway through the meal, Jenna turned to Liam. "I heard you've returned to Johns Hopkins Hospital?"

"Yes." Liam set down his chopsticks. "My parents are getting older. They insisted."

His voice was as calm as stagnant water, revealing no ripples.
###Chapter 422

Jenna glanced at the glass in front of Liam. "Don't you have surgery this afternoon?"

Doctors shouldn't operate after drinking, right?

Liam set down his chopsticks, his expression cool. "I'm off this afternoon."

"Perfect timing to unwind." Jenna raised her glass with a smile. "Let's drink until we drop today."

Ethan stared at Jenna's chattering lips, itching to silence them. Why was she so warm with others but ignored him completely?

His face darkened as he picked up a strip of seaweed and dropped it into her bowl.

Jenna frowned. "I don't eat seaweed."

"Really?" Ethan retrieved the seaweed and replaced it with a snow pea. "How about this?"

Jenna shot an awkward glance at the others. "I can serve myself."

Dylan buried his face in his rice bowl, internally screaming: This meal is torture! Why must I witness the boss flaunting his relationship?

Zoe suppressed a giggle. "Ms. Roland and Mr. Roscente make such a lovely couple."

Jenna nearly rolled her eyes. Lovely where? Ethan was clearly jealous and putting on a show for Liam.

"Decent, I guess," she muttered dismissively.

Ethan narrowed his eyes and suddenly pulled her close. "Just decent?"

Her ears burned. "Stop fooling around. We're eating."

Zoe asked curiously, "When did you two get married?"

Before Jenna could answer, Ethan cupped the back of her head and kissed her in front of everyone.

"Are you insane?" Jenna pushed him away, her face scarlet.

Ethan smirked. "Is kissing my wife illegal?"

Her heart raced—that kiss definitely had ulterior motives.

She hurriedly explained to the others, "Sorry, he's always like this—extremely clingy."

Hearing "our Ethan," his lips curled up involuntarily.

He shot Liam a challenging look. "You don't mind, Dr. Melford?"

Liam dabbed his mouth leisurely. "Feel free. Don't mind us."

Dylan screamed internally: Not mind this? Public PDA is downright savage!
###Chapter 423

Liam Melford set down his chopsticks, his dark eyes locking onto Jenna Roland. "Ms. Roland, I'm finished."

Jenna blinked. "But I thought you had no plans this afternoon?"

"Grandma Blanche isn't feeling well. I need to check on her." He stood, straightening his suit sleeves.

Zoe Macmillan smoothly intervened. "Mr. Roscente, Ms. Roland, let's reschedule. Dr. Melford has a family matter to attend to."

Jenna hurried to see them out. At the elevator, Zoe turned with a polite smile. "No need to escort us further."

The doors slid shut, cutting off Jenna's view of Liam's tall, retreating figure.

A black Maybach idled at the curb. The driver held the door open as Liam folded himself into the backseat.

The car interior carried a faint scent of cedar. Liam leaned back, massaging his temples with long fingers.

"Who would've guessed Ms. Roland is already married?" Zoe murmured. "And to the head of HM Group, no less."

Liam's eyes snapped open, gaze fixed on the passing scenery. His jaw tightened, the air around him turning icy.

"Dr. Melford..." Zoe hesitated. "Is it because of her that you—"

"Mind your words." His voice was arctic. "She's a married woman."

Zoe clenched the file in her lap. She knew better than anyone how Liam had changed since that surgery.

Delayed commitments. Resigning from his prestigious position. Insisting on transferring to Los Angeles—all under the guise of family reasons.

"You're clearly superior to Ethan Roscente," Zoe couldn't help adding. "If you just—"

"Enough." Liam's glare could cut glass. "I have standards. I don't poach another man's wife."

His phone screen lit up, displaying Jenna's profile—a candid shot he'd taken in a hospital corridor.

Sunlight through blinds had cast gold flecks across her lashes.

Zoe looked away, catching Liam's fingers lingering on the photo in her periphery. His sharp features reflected in the window, merging with the night.
###Chapter 424

Liam Melford stared at his phone screen for twenty minutes straight.

Jenna Roland's photo glowed on the display.

His slender finger hovered over the delete button before he finally locked the screen with a quiet sigh.

Zoe Macmillan stood frozen in the office corner, barely daring to breathe.

She'd never seen her workaholic boss like this before.

The ruthless business titan now resembled a lovestruck teenager.

If the media got wind of this, the internet would crash for days.

Zoe shook her head discreetly.

Her boss's private life wasn't her concern.

As long as it didn't affect work.

......

Outside Per Se restaurant.

Jenna's group finished their meal and approached the hostess stand.

"Your total comes to $9,800," the cashier announced with a practiced smile.

Ethan Roscente immediately reached for his phone to pay.

"Wait!" Jenna grabbed his wrist. "This is my treat."

Her wide eyes brooked no argument.

Ethan reluctantly pocketed his phone. "As you wish."

Jenna paid the bill without hesitation, ushering everyone outside.

The extravagant meal had cost nearly ten grand, but the exquisite dishes justified every penny.

"I'm heading back to the orchard," Jenna announced on the sidewalk.

Ethan watched her car disappear before entering his own vehicle.

Vincent Roland tactfully took the backseat.

As the car pulled toward HM Group headquarters, Ethan's voice cut through the silence.

"Not a word about today." His tone left no room for negotiation.

Vincent stiffened.

If news of the CEO's marriage leaked, corporate chaos would ensue.

"Understood, Mr. Roscente."

......

At the orchard, most fencing had been installed.

Jenna found Vincent Roland adjusting a post.

"Did you eat lunch?" she asked.

He wiped sweat from his brow. "Just had some takeout."

"Let me reimburse you." She pulled out her phone.

"Don't worry about it." He waved her off.

Jenna nodded. "Then I'll cook dinner. Any requests?"

Vincent's face lit up. "We'll eat whatever you make, Ms. Roland!"

She laughed. "Prepare for a feast then."
###Chapter 425

The orchard's electric fence system was finally installed.

Jenna Roland had specially ordered fifteen warning signs. The bold red-and-white letters spelling "HIGH VOLTAGE - DANGER" were strikingly visible. She personally nailed each sign along the perimeter, ensuring they could be clearly seen from every angle.

"This should be safe enough," Jenna murmured to herself.

She bent down, picked up a fallen leaf, and lightly tossed it toward the fence.

A sharp zap sounded as the leaf instantly blackened, dissolving into a wisp of smoke.

Jenna's pupils contracted. She took an involuntary step back.

The fence's power exceeded her expectations.

"Good. It'll keep out both thieves and wild boars." Satisfied, she nodded and turned toward the orchard gate.

Her steps froze before she reached it.

Four familiar figures stood blocking the entrance.

Jenna's face darkened, fury igniting in her eyes.

She swiftly pulled out her phone. "Vincent Roland, bring the team down here."

Hanging up, she strode toward the gate.

"Fiona Roland. Heidi Roland. You dare show your faces here?" Her voice was icy. "Get out now, or I won't be responsible for what happens next."

Fiona's face twisted with rage. "You little bitch! How dare you conspire with Ethan Roscente to steal your uncle's orchard? We never should've taken you and your brother in!"

Heidi shrieked, "Do you know what this orchard means to Dad? He's been depressed ever since! If anything happens to him, I'll make you pay!"

Jason Roland hurled curses. "You shameless thief! Give us back our orchard!"

Jenna crossed her arms with a cold laugh.

"If you hadn't 'taken us in,' Victor Roland would never have gotten this orchard in the first place." Her tone dripped with sarcasm. "You've made millions off it over the years. I've been generous not demanding my share. And now you want to steal it all over again?"

Her gaze swept over them, finally landing on Sean Roland.

"Sean. Are you here to pressure me too?"

Sean shook his head. "The orchard was always rightfully yours. Returning it is only just."

His words detonated Fiona's temper.

She viciously pinched her son's arm. "Traitor! Whose side are you on? Keep defending this bitch, and I'll disown you!"

Jason chimed in, "Bro, we're family!"

Heidi added, "How can you betray your own blood?"

Sean's eyes turned frosty. "I have my own principles. Stealing someone's property isn't justified just because you're family. Mom, don't push things too far. Karma has a way of catching up."

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed as Fiona's palm struck Sean's face.

"Get out!" she screamed hysterically. "I have no son like you!"

At that moment, Vincent arrived with the security team, forming a protective line beside Jenna.
###Chapter 426

Four towering bodyguards surrounded Jenna Roland like an iron fortress, their bulging muscles and throbbing veins visible beneath their rolled-up sleeves.

Fiona Roland's group froze in terror, their faces turning ghostly pale.

Zachary Macmillan frowned, his sharp gaze sweeping over Fiona and her companions. "Miss Roland, what's going on?"

Jenna smirked, her delicate finger pointing directly at Fiona. "Memorize these faces. From now on, if you see them, don't hesitate—act immediately."

She pulled Sean Roland close, her tone softening. "Except him. He's my brother."

Fiona trembled with rage, shrieking, "Jenna! You ungrateful wretch! How dare you hire thugs to attack us!"

A cold glint flashed in Jenna's eyes as she ordered Vincent Roland, "Seize that shrew. Beat her until she apologizes."

"As you wish."

With a subtle nod from Vincent, Zachary and Yves Deross stepped forward. One yanked Fiona's hair while the other twisted her arms behind her back.

Crack!

The sharp sound of a slap echoed through the air.

Jason Roland and Heidi Roland tried to intervene but were forced back by Quentin Blanchet's gleaming pistol.

"Take another step. I dare you," Quentin taunted, twirling the gun with a smirk.

The couple staggered backward, their legs buckling in fear.

They never imagined Jenna could command armed enforcers.

Blows rained down on Fiona like a storm.

"Ah! Stop! I surrender!" She curled into a ball on the ground, her face bruised and swollen as she begged for mercy.

Vincent raised a hand, and the bodyguards instantly retreated behind Jenna.

Fiona staggered to her feet, blood trickling from her lips. "I... I was wrong..."

Jenna looked down at her with icy disdain. "Selling me off, abusing me and my brother, stealing my parents' orchard—apologies won't settle these debts."

Her red lips parted. "Kneel. Swear you'll never harass me again, or may lightning strike you dead and your entire family perish."

"You—!" Fiona's eyes widened in outrage.

Jenna turned to Heidi. "You. Repeat those words exactly. One mistake, and you'll taste the same punishment."

Heidi paled, trembling as she recited the venomous oath, her nails digging into her palms.
###Chapter 427

Fiona Roland trembled with rage, jabbing a finger at Heidi's face. "If she told you to eat shit, would you do it? Are you that stupid?"

Heidi pouted defensively. "Mom, she forced me! It's not like I wanted to say those things. Why are you taking it out on me?"

Jenna Roland crossed her arms, a cold smirk playing on her lips. "Fiona, did you hear that clearly? Should I have someone refresh your memory? One wrong word, and you'll be crawling out of here today."

"Jenna!" Jason Roland's knuckles cracked as he clenched his fists. "She's your elder! You'll pay for this disrespect!"

Jenna's gaze sharpened like a blade. "Pay for it? Where was your conscience when you stole my orchard? Jason, you're shameless!"

Vincent Roland cut in smoothly. "Shameless is putting it mildly."

"Beyond shameless," Jenna sneered. "You're downright despicable. Worse than animals."

The Roland family turned pale with fury but didn't dare move. Jenna's intimidating bodyguards stood ready to strike.

They had no choice but to swallow their pride.

Zachary Macmillan cracked his knuckles impatiently. "Why waste words? Break their legs. That'll teach them not to cause trouble."

"Agreed." Jenna nodded.

Fiona panicked. "Jenna, you can't do this!"

"Don't want a beating?" Jenna narrowed her eyes. "Then swear an oath. Set foot in my orchard again, and you'll eat dog shit. Deal?"

"You—!" Fiona shook with rage.

Jenna raised a hand. "No? Then let's do this now."

Fiona couldn't understand what Jenna had offered these men to make them so fiercely loyal.

In the end, under threat of violence, Fiona and her family reluctantly swore the humiliating oath and slunk away.

Sean Roland frowned worriedly. "They won't let this go."

Jenna patted his shoulder. "They try again, we hit harder. The orchard's electric fence will take care of the rest."

Mercy toward scum was cruelty to oneself.

Vincent gave a thumbs-up. "Ms. Roland, you're tough."

"Had to be." Jenna sighed. "Let's go check inside."

That evening, Ethan Roscente came home early.

The aroma of dinner filled the kitchen, where Jenna stood at the stove.

"You're back early," she said without turning.

Ethan walked over and glanced into the pot. "Nothing urgent at the office. Need help?"

"No. Wash up. Dinner's ready."

As Ethan left, Jenna plated the last dish.
###Chapter 428

Jenna Roland carefully packed the steaming dishes into an insulated container, her movements as gentle as if handling a precious gift.

Ethan Roscente sat at the dining table, his gaze following her every motion.

"Eat first," Jenna said, securing the last lid before finally taking her seat across from him.

They finished dinner in comfortable silence. Jenna stood to clear the dishes.

"Your turn to wash up today." She waved the insulated container at him. "I need to deliver this."

Ethan's eyes lingered on the container, his throat bobbing. A pang of jealousy struck him toward whoever would receive her home-cooked meal.

"Alright." He accepted the dishes, watching her leave.

The orchard lights glowed warmly against the night. Jenna handed the container to the night-shift workers, turning away before they could thank her.

The rural nightscape caught her attention in the parking lot. Distant mountain silhouettes melted into the star-studded sky.

She snapped a photo with her phone and sent it to Ethan.

"The air's wonderful here. Want to take a walk together sometime?"

Her phone buzzed almost instantly. His reply was characteristically blunt: "Too many mosquitoes."

Jenna chuckled, starting the car for home.

Ethan sat blankly before the TV when she returned. At the sound of the door, he immediately turned.

"Join me?" He gestured to the screen.

Jenna glanced at the melodramatic soap opera playing and wrinkled her nose in distaste.

"I'm showering." She marched past him without a second look.

Ethan shrugged, then remembered something. He rummaged through the TV cabinet drawer, emerging with a bag of potato chips.

The crisp rustle of the bag opening filled the room. He tentatively tried one chip—then his eyes lit up.

When Jenna stepped out with damp hair, the scene froze her in place.

Four empty chip bags littered the coffee table. Ethan was licking his fingers with relish.

"I thought you called this junk food?" Jenna pointed accusingly at the evidence.

Ethan maintained perfect innocence. "Tastes better than expected."

"Four bags! You ate four bags!" Her voice climbed an octave. "You had three bowls of rice two hours ago!"

Rubbing his rounded stomach, Ethan declared with absolute conviction: "Stomachs are like balloons—there's always room for good food."

The man who'd once scorned snacks was now making excuses for potato chips. Jenna facepalmed, torn between laughter and exasperation.
###Chapter 429

Jenna Roland leaned against the armrest, her fingers toying with Ethan Roscente's cufflink.

"Did you always eat this much?"

"No." His reply was crisp. Suddenly, he leaned closer, his breath warm against her ear. "But your cooking's too good. What if you turn me into a balloon?"

She burst out laughing, poking his rock-hard abs. "With your metabolism? You could eat a horse and still stay ripped."

Ethan caught her mischievous hand, eyes glinting. "But if I did get fat... would you still want me?"

Jenna arched a brow. Lately, his appetite had skyrocketed, yet his physique remained unfairly perfect. Those eight-pack abs looked chiseled from marble.

"Of course."

"Really?"

"Why would I lie?"

Her diplomatic smile made Ethan snort. Releasing her, he flicked open his lighter. Smoke curled between them as he squinted. "Company gym. One hour daily. Rain or shine."

"You find time for that?"

"Lunch breaks." He tapped ash into the tray. "Or you'd have a husband shaped like a beach ball."

The jingle of keys interrupted them.

Milo Roland and Ryan Watson trudged in, dumping armfuls of bags by the shoe rack. Jenna hurried over. "Saved you dinner. Want it heated?"

"We grabbed noodles, sis." Milo shrugged off his mud-splattered jacket, calling toward the couch, "Hey, bro."

Ethan grunted without looking up, eyes fixed on the financial news.

"Sold out?" Jenna accepted Milo's phone—a $4,000 transfer notification. When he thrust crumpled bills at her, she peeled off five and tucked them back into his pocket. "For you and Ryan."

Turning to the fidgeting teen, her voice softened. "I'm managing the orchard now. Come help weekends—hourly pay."

Ryan's eyes lit up with a vigorous nod.

As the boys disappeared toward the shower, Jenna sank back onto the sofa. Ethan's arm slid around her shoulders, carrying the faint scent of tobacco.
###Chapter 430

Ethan Roscente's gaze fixed on her face, his brows furrowing. "Why is he living here now?"

Jenna Roland quickly turned off the TV, afraid Ryan Watson might overhear. She pulled Ethan into the bedroom.

She locked the door behind them and dragged him to the floor-to-ceiling window.

Releasing his wrist, Jenna took a deep breath. "Ryan's parents divorced. Neither wants him. His father sold their house. He has nowhere to go."

Ethan arched an eyebrow. "That bad?" His tone held no trace of sympathy.

"His grandparents passed away." Jenna twisted her fingers. "He's closest to Milo, and he's been helping me..."

She'd been trying to bring this up for days but didn't know how.

Suddenly Ethan gripped her shoulders, his gaze intense. "This is your home. You decide who stays."

Jenna's eyes grew moist. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me between husband and wife." He tapped her nose playfully. "I'm going to shower."

She nodded with a smile.

Once Ethan entered the bathroom, she headed to Milo's room.

The two boys were sprawled on the bed playing video games.

"Sis!" Milo immediately dropped his phone.

"Your brother-in-law agreed." Jenna looked at Ryan. "But there's one condition."

Ryan sat up straight. "Name it."

"Protect Milo at school."

"Obviously!" Ryan grinned.

Back in the bedroom, Jenna scrolled through her phone searching for fruit distributors.

With the orchard reclaimed, harvest season approached. Buyers needed securing.

She sent a private message to a produce wholesaler.

As she browsed listings, the bathroom door opened.

Ethan emerged with a towel around his waist, water droplets trailing down his abs.

"Did I gain weight?" He stood by the bed.

Jenna's ears burned. "Put some clothes on first."

"I was afraid you'd say I'm fat." His voice held mock hurt.

"You're not!" She covered her eyes. "Go get dressed."

Peeking through her fingers, she stole another glance.

One day, when she felt bold enough, she'd run her hands over those muscles herself.
###Chapter 431

Dawn light filtered through the trees as Jenna Roland drove toward her family's orchard.

The crisp morning air carried the scent of fresh grass. Her fingers tightened around the steering wheel as concerns about the orchard's sales surfaced.

But the fruit wasn't ripe yet. Approaching potential buyers prematurely would seem unprofessional. She decided to wait until the first harvest was ready before arranging meetings with samples.

Her phone rang abruptly. The screen flashed "Stella Laurent." Jenna pulled over and answered.

"Stella, has your sister been discharged?"

"She left the hospital over a month ago. Her recovery is going well." Stella's voice sounded exhausted.

Jenna exhaled in relief—until a choked sob came through the line.

"But...we're not safe."

Jenna's brow furrowed. "What happened?"

"We've moved four times. Each time, Yvonne's people found us." Stella's voice trembled. "They leave dead rats...cats...even excrement at our door. We're losing our minds!"

Jenna's knuckles whitened around the phone. "Were you followed?"

"I don't know how they keep tracking us down." Desperation seeped into Stella's words.

Jenna's chest heaved. She hadn't imagined Yvonne would pursue them so relentlessly after what she'd already done to Sylvia.

"Where are you now?"

"Under a bridge..." Stella broke down weeping. "Last night we heard strange noises—it must be them! Jenna, please help us!"

Flames of anger ignited in Jenna's eyes. "Send me your location. I'm coming now."

She hung up and jerked the steering wheel around. Gravel crunched violently beneath the tires.

Two hours later, Jenna parked near a derelict bridge on the outskirts of town. She called Stella. "I'm here. Come out."

When two gaunt figures emerged from the shadows, Jenna barely recognized them. The once-vibrant sisters now resembled walking skeletons. Sylvia's face was ghostly pale, while Stella's cheekbones protruded sharply. Their clothes were soiled, hair matted with grease—they looked like homeless vagrants.

Jenna gripped the wheel until her nails bit into her palms.
###Chapter 432

Tears streamed down Stella Laurent's face the moment she saw Jenna Roland.

She stumbled forward, her voice choked with sobs. "Jenna, we've got nowhere else to turn..."

Jenna steadied her trembling shoulders.

Sylvia Savigny stood nearby, her face as pale as parchment, lips cracked and bleeding.

"Not here." Jenna cut her off. "Let's get you both cleaned up at my place."

She briskly opened the car door and ushered the sisters into the backseat.

Inside the Beverly Hills elevator, Stella continued weeping. "That lunatic Yvonne—"

"Shh." Jenna pressed a finger to her lips. "Wait till we're inside."

The moment they entered, Jenna nudged them toward the bathroom. "Did you bring clothes?"

After receiving their nods, she turned and dialed Ethan Roscente's number.

"I've taken in the Laurent sisters," Jenna stated bluntly. "Yvonne wants them dead."

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Are you sure you want to get involved?" Ethan's voice carried resignation.

Jenna scoffed. "I stood up to the Rolands. You think she scares me?"

"What about Officer Hill—"

"The evidence is solid. He'll handle it!"

Ethan sighed. "You're being naive."

Jenna clenched her fists. "Should I just let them die?"

"That's not what I meant." He paused. "Call me if you need backup."

"Don't bother." Jenna rolled her eyes. "Just focus on the company."

As she hung up, the clatter of pots came from the kitchen.

Sylvia stood hesitantly in the doorway, words caught in her throat.

Jenna didn't turn around. "Go rest. I'll call you when dinner's ready."

The chopping of the knife against the cutting board echoed sharply through the penthouse.
###Chapter 433 

Stella and Sylvia stepped out of the bathroom wrapped in towels, droplets still clinging to their hair. The aroma of cooked food drifted from the kitchen. Exchanging a glance, they pushed the door open to help.

Jenna stirred the vegetables in the wok without turning around, passing the salt shaker to Stella over her shoulder.

Three dishes and a soup were soon served. Jenna wiped her hands. "Go ahead and eat. I saved some for Vincent and the others."

Stella picked up a piece of braised pork, her eyes lighting up. "Your cooking keeps getting better, Jenna."

Jenna leaned back on the couch, texting Milo: "Stella and Sylvia are staying a few days. You and Ryan take a hotel."

An OK emoji popped up instantly.

Amid the clinking of utensils, Sylvia suddenly whispered, "Sis, do you think those people might—"

"Shh." Stella glanced toward the living room. "Eat first."

After clearing the table, Stella pushed Jenna onto the sofa. "Rest. We'll handle this."

Jenna's gaze lingered on the dark circles under their eyes. "The guest room is ready. Go take a nap."

She led them to the room and quietly closed the door.

The deadbolt clicked shut. Standing in the foyer, Jenna dialed the security camera company.

At exactly eleven, a technician in blue overalls arrived with his toolbox.

"Visible installation at the door, hidden on the opposite wall." Jenna pointed to the fire exit. "Put a pinhole camera there."

As the technician wired the system on his ladder, Jenna's phone buzzed. Ethan's message appeared: "Need help?"

She stared at the screen for three seconds before replying, "Not yet."

Her fingers trembled slightly as she handed over $2,000 in cash. On her phone app, three camera feeds lit up simultaneously. The pinhole lens even captured the small ads on the stairwell walls.

When the alarm system was set, the technician pointed to the interface. "Red light flashes if someone tampers with the cameras."

The microwave beeped. Carrying a thermal lunchbox, Jenna ran into Ethan in the elevator.

"Delivering food?" His eyes dropped to the bag in her hand.

Jenna nodded. "Might not be at the studio much lately."

The hospital hallway reeked of disinfectant. Vincent accepted the meal as Jenna abruptly said, "Can I borrow two men?"

Yves froze mid-bite. "What's wrong?"

"Someone's targeting my friends." Jenna tightened her grip on her backpack straps. "They're all women. I'm worried."

Zachary slammed the table. "I'll go! Not even a fly will get past me!"

Vincent chewed slowly. "Reason?"

"Miss Roland's braised pork is ten times better than hospital food!" Yves' ears turned red.

A muffled laugh came from the corner. Watching the three men argue over who would guard her apartment, Jenna felt some tension ease.

"Then it's settled." As she turned, the glass window reflected Vincent's hesitant expression behind her.
###Chapter 434

Quentin Blanchet slammed his hand on the table. "No! Miss Roland should decide this herself!"

Vincent Roland immediately chimed in. "Exactly. Jenna, you choose. See which of us is more suitable to go with you."

Jenna Roland massaged her temples with a sigh. "What are you thinking? It's just about protecting my friend."

"We still need to choose!" Vincent insisted.

Jenna looked at the four men before her, exasperated. Picking anyone would offend the others, and that wasn't what she wanted.

An idea struck her. She turned and plucked four blades of grass from the yard—two long, two short.

Clutching them in her fist with only the tips visible, she said, "We'll draw straws. Short ones come with me. No complaints—you agreed to this."

"No problem!" Vincent was the first to respond.

The four took turns drawing. Vincent Roland and Yves Deross ended up with the short straws.

"Perfect!" The two high-fived in triumph.

Quentin Blanchet and Zachary Macmillan's faces fell.

"Let's eat first," Jenna said with a smile. "We'll all go together after."

Quentin wolfed down his meal and immediately stationed himself beside Jenna. Once Vincent finished eating, the three set off.

When they returned to Beverly Hills, Stella Laurent and her sister were still asleep.

Jenna had the two men wait in the living room. Vincent's phone suddenly rang.

He stepped onto the balcony to answer. "Mr. Roscente."

"Get to Beverly Hills immediately to protect Jenna," Ethan Roscente's icy voice commanded through the phone. "If you see any suspicious individuals, break their legs first, then send them to the police."

"We're already here," Vincent reported. "Miss Roland asked us to come because she was worried about her friend's safety."

"Remember, Jenna must not be harmed in any way."

"Understood."

Hanging up, Vincent returned to the living room. Jenna had just turned on the TV.

Suddenly, her phone emitted a shrill alarm.

The surveillance feed showed three shadowy figures outside. Two were tampering with the cameras while another attempted to pick the lock.

"They're here!" Jenna's eyes sharpened.

Vincent and Quentin bolted outside. Within moments, they had the three intruders pinned to the ground.

Jenna strode over to the man sprawled on the floor and delivered a sharp kick. "Talk! Did Yvonne Valois send you?"

Quentin suddenly pointed to a corner. "What's that?"

Jenna didn't even glance. "Probably a dead rat or some poor animal! These scum!" She turned to Vincent. "Beat them until they wish they were dead!"
###Chapter 435

As Quentin Blanchet and his men were about to strike, Jenna Roland walked toward the black plastic bag.

She yanked it open, revealing a pile of dead rats inside.

Jenna's eyes turned icy. Just as she suspected—Yvonne Valois had sent them.

She approached Quentin and signaled for them to stop.

Three bruised and battered men lay groaning on the ground.

"So you're the ones harassing Stella and Sylvia Laurent?" Jenna said coldly.

"Denying it won't help." She nudged the black bag with her foot. "These dead rats are proof enough."

Crossing her arms, she continued, "I won't call the police, and I won't let them beat you to death."

"Go back and tell Yvonne this isn't just about the Laurent sisters anymore." Her eyes narrowed. "She'll pay for this. Now get out!"

The three men scrambled to their feet and fled.

"Wait!" Jenna snapped. "Take your trash with you!"

The last man stumbled back, grabbed the bag of dead rats, and bolted.

A loud thud echoed from the dumpster downstairs.

Once inside their car, Ian Heilbronn frowned at their injuries.

"What happened? Who did this?"

Shane Lombardi winced as he tried to speak, his split lip throbbing.

Jacob Agrigent gritted his teeth. "There's a woman living with them—she's got two bodyguards!"

"Those guys were trained. We didn't stand a chance."

Ian looked stunned. "All three of you lost?"

Shane cradled his swollen cheek. "That woman also said to tell Yvonne she's coming for her."

With no choice, Ian dialed Yvonne's number.

At the spa, Yvonne answered with her eyes closed.

"Yvonne, the Laurent sisters are living with someone—a woman with two bodyguards..."

When she heard "coming for me," Yvonne's eyes flew open.

She sneered. "Who does that bitch think she is?"

"Find out everything about her." Her red lips curled. "Next time, break the Laurent sisters' legs."

After hanging up, Ian relayed the orders.

Bridget Valois immediately pulled out her phone to investigate.

...

Back at the Beverly Hills penthouse, Jenna and Vincent Roland were watching TV when Stella and Sylvia emerged from their rooms.
###Chapter 436

Jenna Roland put down the remote when she saw the sisters were awake. "Hungry? I can order takeout for you."

Stella Laurent rubbed her eyes. "No, we're fine. Were you watching TV?"

"Yeah," Jenna nodded. "By the way, Yvonne Valois sent people over earlier. They tried to leave a dead rat at the door, but my security cameras caught them."

She grinned and waved her fist. "I had the bodyguards beat the crap out of them!"

Sylvia Savigny sat bolt upright. "They found us already?"

Stella's face turned pale, her fingers twisting the hem of her shirt.

Jenna reassured them, "Don't worry. I've hired bodyguards. They'll protect you from now on."

Sylvia stood and bowed deeply to Vincent Roland and Quentin Blanchet. "Thank you."

Vincent scratched his head sheepishly. "No big deal. Don't mention it."

Quentin glanced curiously at Jenna. "Aren't you going to introduce us, Miss Roland?"

Jenna blinked. "This is Stella and Sylvia, my friends. And these two are Quentin and Vincent. Feel free to call them if you need anything."

Quentin gave a warm smile. "We've got plenty of free time. Just say the word."

Vincent rolled up his sleeves to flex. "Ten guys wouldn't stand a chance against us!"

Stella giggled. "Then we'll be counting on you, Quentin, Vincent."

Jenna narrowed her eyes. These two had never been this eager to impress in front of her before.

Sylvia suddenly turned serious. "Jenna, since they beat up Yvonne's men, she'll definitely come after you."

Jenna waved dismissively. "I've got bodyguards. She can't touch me."

What she didn't know was that her husband Ethan Roscente, CEO of HM Group, wielded immense power. If Yvonne dared lay a finger on Jenna, Ethan would make her regret being born.

Vincent and Quentin exchanged glances before cautiously suggesting, "Should we call Zachary and the others over too?"

Jenna refused firmly. "No. Someone needs to keep watch at the orchard."

She hadn't forgotten how Victor Roland's family was eyeing the property like vultures.
###Chapter 437

Jenna Roland pulled out a dining chair and sat down, her gaze resting on Justin Kemnis. "Mr. Kemnis, please help yourself."

"Thanks." Justin picked up his chopsticks and took a bite of the braised pork.

The meat melted in his mouth, rich with savory sauce. His eyes lit up. "Jenna, with skills like this, you could run a successful restaurant."

She smiled faintly. "Just call me Jenna."

"Alright." He reached for the stir-fried vegetables. "Ever thought about opening one?"

Her fingers twisted together. "Not enough capital."

She stole a glance at Ethan Roscente. The man sat rigidly at the table, chewing his food without expression.

"I could invest." Justin set down his chopsticks. "Talent like yours deserves recognition."

Jenna shook her head. "Too risky."

He didn't press further. "The offer stands if you change your mind."

His gaze lingered pointedly on Ethan. The guy had been scowling since arrival like someone owed him a fortune.

Stranger still—Jenna kept addressing him as "Mr. Roscente."

After dinner, as Jenna began clearing plates, Ethan abruptly stood to help.

Justin's eyes widened. The CEO of HM Group was doing dishes?

When everything was tidied, Jenna brought two steaming cups of tea.

"Mr. Roscente, Mr. Kemnis, please enjoy."

Justin finally blurted, "Why so formal between spouses?"

Jenna blinked in confusion. "Is there a problem?"

Ethan shot him a warning glare. Justin quickly backtracked: "Ahem. Let's discuss your brother's situation instead."
###Chapter 438

073 took a deep breath, a faint smile curling at the corners of his lips. His gaze pierced through the camouflage netting, settling on the distant coastline of Cape Apo. The white marine observatory stood silent at the edge of the bay.

"Let me tell you a story," 073 said, his voice low and steady.

"Long ago, there was an ancient forest. The creatures within lived in harmony, generation after generation."

"Then one day, a demon arrived without warning."

His fingers tapped lightly against the ground, the rhythm matching a heartbeat.

"The demon opened its crimson eyes, coveting the vibrant life of the forest. Envious of its beauty, it vowed to turn the woodland into a hellscape fit for its kind."

"It disguised itself as an ordinary animal, lurking in the shadows."

An Xiaohai noticed the sharpness in 073's gaze.

"The guardian of the forest sensed the disturbance and sent its finest hunter. Armed with a divine sword, the hunter swore to sever the demon's head."

073 paused, his eyes drifting toward the horizon.

"The hunter moved unseen through the trees. He witnessed monkeys bullying squirrels, boars trampling flower fields—yet he turned a blind eye."

"Until he saw a starving wolf tearing into a rabbit."

His fist clenched involuntarily.

"The hunter struck. One clean kill. But the scent of blood roused the demon."

The sea breeze rustled the camouflage netting.

"The demon retaliated with madness. It sowed more carnage, even twisting other creatures into demons."

073's voice grew colder.

"The hunter realized mercy was futile. He locked away his compassion and focused solely on the hunt."

"Then he encountered a fawn, pursued by a tiger."

Suddenly, 073 turned to An Xiaohai, his expression unreadable.

"The fawn was drenched in blood, its eyes burning with hatred—tainted by the demon's essence."

Seagulls cried in the distance.

"The hunter hesitated. He saw the demon's corruption spreading through the forest."

073 stood, brushing dust from his clothes.

"In the end, the hunter walked away. He knew only the demon's annihilation would end this plague."

The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the ground.

"As for that fawn..." 073 murmured, "if it truly becomes a demon, the hunter will draw his sword again."

Out at sea, the observatory's lights flickered to life, piercing through the twilight.
###Chapter 439

Jenna Roland lifted her gaze, her clear eyes resting on Justin Kemnis's face. "What would you like to know, Mr. Kemnis?"

Justin lounged lazily on the sofa, his long legs crossed. His slender fingers rested casually on his knee. "Start with your family background."

"My parents passed away when I was young." Jenna's voice was soft. "My younger brother and I were taken in by my uncle's family. After five years, we moved out on our own."

Justin's brow furrowed slightly. "Why your uncle?"

Her fingers trembled faintly, gripping the hem of her shirt. "The other relatives... didn't want us."

She glanced at Justin's empty notebook. "Aren't you going to take notes?"

"I'll remember." He waved a dismissive hand. "How's your brother now?"

"He has congenital heart disease." Her voice grew quieter. "He should have had surgery as a child, but it kept getting delayed. He's a sophomore now, with excellent grades. We... only have each other."

Ethan Roscente offered Justin a cigarette and lit one for himself. Through the haze of smoke, his gaze drifted subtly toward Jenna.

Justin exhaled a slow curl of smoke. "What happens if he doesn't get the surgery?"

Jenna took a deep breath. "He'll die." She lifted her chin. "That's why I work at the club—to save up for his operation."

"How much do you need?"

"About nine hundred thousand total. The surgery alone is seven to eight hundred thousand, plus follow-up treatments."

Justin tapped his cigarette into the ashtray. "I understand the situation. I'll give you an answer within two days."

The tension in Jenna's shoulders finally eased. A faint smile touched her lips. "Thank you, Mr. Kemnis."

"Let's go." Justin stubbed out his cigarette and stood.

Ethan rose as well, pausing to give Jenna one last lingering look before following.

Inside the elevator, Justin leaned against the wall. "Orphaned, raising a terminally ill brother alone. Your woman's had it rough."

Ethan stared at the elevator buttons, his voice icy. "I know."

"Be good to her." Justin raised an eyebrow.

"None of your business." Ethan's tone remained frosty.

Justin suddenly slung an arm over his shoulder. "I played my part well, didn't I?"

Ethan's eyes turned glacial. "Remove your hand."

"After helping you this much, I can't even touch you?" Justin scoffed.

"Filthy." Ethan spat the single word.
###Chapter 440

Yvonne's nails dug deep into her palms. She never imagined the first one to demand divorce would be her father-in-law, Vincent Valois!

Everything she'd done was for Lucien Valois!

Vincent stood up, looking down at her with cold detachment. "Before this escalates, file for divorce tomorrow. I'll compensate you for your years with the Valois family."

"You'll regret this!" Yvonne snatched her phone and stormed out, her stilettos striking the floor in furious rhythm.

Vincent turned to his son. "Don't think divorce means you can run to Jenna Roland. Set foot in her home, and I'll break your legs."

"Understood." Lucien lowered his head to hide his smirk.

His pulse quickened at the thought of freedom. Years of suppressed longing for Jenna would finally be unleashed.

That obstacle Yvonne would finally be gone from his life!

......

The black Mercedes sped down the highway.

Yvonne nearly swerved when her father's call came through.

"Dad! The Valois family is throwing me out!" She jerked the car to the roadside. "After all I've done for them!"

Leonard Heilbronn's roar vibrated through the speaker. "I was about to ask your father-in-law for help! Ethan Roscente is targeting our family—we've already lost nearly a hundred million!"

"Ethan?" Ice flooded Yvonne's veins.

"Our stocks are crashing! The company will go bankrupt if this continues! Get Vincent to intervene immediately!"

Her hands trembled.

Now she understood—that insignificant Jenna was Ethan's untouchable weakness!

"Dad... I dragged our family into this." Her voice shook as she confessed her schemes against Jenna.

The sound of shattering porcelain exploded through the phone.

"You foolish girl!" Leonard bellowed. "Don't you dare step foot in the Heilbronn residence again!"

The call ended with brutal finality.

Yvonne sat frozen, her ghostly reflection staring back from the rearview mirror.

Ethan Roscente would destroy her entire family—all for Jenna Roland!
###Chapter 441

Yvonne's hand trembled as she clutched her phone.

Her father's icy words still echoed in her ears.

The phrase "sever all ties" stabbed her heart like a knife.

Her nails dug deep into her palms, but she felt no pain.

"Dad, I'm your own daughter!" Her voice shook. "Ethan targeting the Yang family is his doing. Why take it out on me?"

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"If you hadn't provoked Jenna, would Ethan have set his sights on us?" Mr. Yang's tone was unyielding. "The empire Grandpa built is about to crumble because of you! Don't ever show your face to me again!"

The call ended abruptly.

Yvonne stood frozen, her phone clattering to the floor.

The world seemed to spin around her.

Kicked out by the Lu family. Divorce papers to sign tomorrow. Now even her own family had disowned her.

She sank to her knees, hugging her legs tightly.

Tears splashed onto the floor, forming dark puddles.

Her phone rang sharply.

"Big Brother" flashed on the screen.

Yvonne wiped her face roughly and answered.

"Yvonne." Ethan Yang sounded exhausted. "You know the situation. Only you can save the family now."

Her throat tightened. "Me?"

"Go see Jenna." He lowered his voice. "Beg her to make Ethan back off. Once we survive this, Dad will forgive you."

Yvonne bit her lip until it bled.

Seeing Jenna meant facing Sylvia.

The woman who stole her husband.

To grovel before her rival?

But if she refused...

She closed her eyes. "Understood."

After hanging up, she dialed Bridget.

"Get me Jenna's contact details." Her voice sounded eerily calm.

Keyboard clicks came through the line.

Leaning against her car door, Yvonne suddenly laughed.

The sound was laced with self-mockery.

Who would've thought the Yang heiress would one day beg for help.

......

Next day at noon.

Jenna carried a thermal lunchbox toward the orchard.

Zachary and Yves had taken over most duties, but the new guards still needed meals.

As she slid into the driver's seat after the delivery, her phone rang.

Unknown number.

"Hello, this is Jenna."

"Yvonne Valois."

Jenna's fingers stilled.

"What do you want?"

"Can we meet? About Sylvia... and Ethan."

Jenna narrowed her eyes. "Why should I trust you?"

"I swear no harm will come to Sylvia." Yvonne's voice was hoarse. "This meeting is to resolve things."

"Ethan?" Jenna frowned. "What's your connection to him?"

"Face to face." Yvonne sounded sincere. "You choose the location."

After a pause, Jenna replied, "3 p.m. Blue Bottle Coffee in downtown."
###Chapter 442

Jenna Roland ended the call and turned the steering wheel toward Beverly Hills.

A crowd had already gathered at the gated entrance. Vincent Roland stood guard with several bodyguards, while Sylvia Savigny and Stella Laurent stood among them, their expressions tense.

She rolled down the window and motioned for them to get in.

The unremarkable minivan had just enough space for everyone.

"Where are we going?" Sylvia asked the moment she settled into her seat.

Jenna pressed the accelerator, her gaze fixed on the road ahead. "To see Yvonne Valois."

The car fell silent.

Stella's fingers twisted together unconsciously. "Why now? Our plan hasn't even started yet."

"She requested a meeting." Jenna's voice was eerily calm. "Said she wanted to apologize for what happened before and discuss Ethan."

Sylvia let out a cold laugh. "Apologize? She's been trying to kill me."

"That's why I brought you all and Vincent." Jenna glanced in the rearview mirror. "No matter what tricks she has, we have the numbers."

Tension thickened in the air. No one spoke again.

The sound of tires rolling over asphalt was unnervingly loud.

The café's glass door swung open with a chime of bells.

By the window sat an elegant woman stirring her coffee with deliberate slowness.

Jenna narrowed her eyes, instantly recognizing the figure she'd once seen at the hospital.

Yvonne looked up with a gentle smile.

The next second, Sylvia lunged forward.

"You murderer!" Sylvia's hands clamped around Yvonne's throat, nails digging deep into her skin.

Yvonne didn't resist, her face gradually turning blue.

"Stop!" Jenna and Stella rushed to pull Sylvia's hands away by force.

Sylvia heaved ragged breaths, her eyes burning with hatred. "I should've strangled you to death!"

Yvonne coughed, rubbing her neck, yet that unsettling smile never faded.

"You left me to die under that bridge. Then you came to the hospital to finish the job." Sylvia's voice shook. "What's this act about now?"

Other patrons turned to stare. A waiter hesitated, unsure whether to call the police.

Vincent gave a sharp look, and two bodyguards immediately blocked the exit.

Jenna gripped Sylvia's shoulder, her icy gaze fixed on Yvonne. "You'd better have a damn good reason for this performance today."
###Chapter 443

Sylvia Savigny's fingers tightened around Yvonne Valois' throat. Yvonne coughed violently, her face flushing crimson.

She didn't struggle. Resistance would mean the failure of today's negotiation.

The Valois family had abandoned her. Even her own father had severed ties.

If she didn't act now, she would lose her last chance to return home.

She had nothing left—except her family.

But she hadn't expected Jenna Roland to bring so many people.

Jenna lounged on the sofa, arms crossed. "Weren't you going to apologize to Sylvia? Get on with it."

Swallowing her humiliation, Yvonne forced herself to stand. "Sylvia, I shouldn't have kidnapped you. I shouldn't have tried to kill you. I was wrong."

She bowed deeply, her posture submissive.

Sylvia wasn't satisfied.

"Two attempts on my life, and a simple 'sorry' is enough?" Sylvia's eyes glittered with malice. "I want you to kneel."

Yvonne's head snapped up. "What?"

"On your knees. Kowtow and beg for forgiveness." Sylvia enunciated each word.

Yvonne froze. She hadn't anticipated this demand.

The room was crowded. Stella Laurent watched with glee. Jenna's gaze pinned her in place.

If she knelt, her dignity would be shattered.

But she had no choice.

Gritting her teeth, Yvonne dropped to her knees with a thud. "Sylvia, please forgive me."

Sylvia grabbed her hair and delivered four sharp slaps across her face.

The sound of skin striking skin echoed through the room.

Yvonne's cheeks swelled instantly. Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.

"Never thought you'd end up like this, did you?" Sylvia yanked her hair backward. "Lucien Valois never loved you. He wouldn't even touch you. Was it worth it?"

The woman who once commanded respect now lay broken.

"We're divorced," Yvonne murmured.

Sylvia paused, then burst into laughter. "So you were thrown out! Though you should've seen it coming."

Yvonne endured the humiliation in silence.

Sylvia released her and turned to Jenna. "Thanks for letting me vent."

"Don't mention it." Jenna's eyes shifted to Yvonne. "Now, about Ethan Roscente's matter."

As Yvonne tried to rise, Sylvia kicked the back of her knee.

"Who said you could stand?" Sylvia sneered. "Stay on your knees."

Yvonne collapsed, pain shooting through her kneecaps and palms.
###Chapter 444

Yvonne looked down at her bloodied palm, the stinging pain radiating through her entire body.

She had grown up pampered in the Yang family, and after marrying into the Valois household, she was treated like royalty.

Yet today, Sylvia had publicly slapped her and forced her to kneel and beg for mercy.

Yvonne struggled to stand, but her knees buckled, forcing her back to the ground.

"Jenna, Ethan is targeting the Yang family!" Her voice trembled. "Please, for old times' sake, make him stop!"

Jenna frowned.

Ethan was just a department head. How could he possibly shake the mighty Yang family?

She stepped forward, looking down at Yvonne. "Don't make baseless accusations."

Yvonne desperately grabbed her pant leg. "My father told me himself!"

Jenna jerked her leg free and kicked Yvonne in the shoulder. "Shut up!"

Yvonne fell onto her back but suddenly burst into laughter. "So you don't know his real identity?"

Jenna's heart skipped a beat.

"Ethan isn't just a department head," Yvonne wiped blood from her lips. "He's the true power behind HM Group!"

Stella gasped. "That's absurd!"

Vincent and Yves exchanged glances, their faces paling.

This was bad.

The secret Ethan had worked so hard to keep was about to be exposed.

Jenna's hands shook as she dialed his number. "Ethan, tell her yourself—who are you really?"

In the executive office of HM Group, Ethan's pen snapped in half.

"Just a department head," he said calmly. "Don't listen to her lies."

Yvonne's eyes widened.

Why was he lying?

Jenna stared at her phone screen, watching the call timer tick away.

The rustling of papers came through the speaker.

Then Ethan's breathing suddenly became unnervingly clear.
###Chapter 445 

Jenna Roland cast a cold glance at Yvonne Valois. "Did you hear that? He denied it himself."

Yvonne's chest heaved violently, her nails digging deep into her palms. Ethan Roscente's denial was like a bucket of ice water extinguishing her last flicker of hope.

She finally understood—she had lost completely.

Not only had she lost Lucien Valois, but she was about to destroy her family's business with her own hands.

Her knees suddenly gave way, and she collapsed heavily before Jenna. As her forehead touched the floor, tears splashed onto the tiles.

Stella Laurent tugged worriedly at Jenna's sleeve. "She's—"

"She brought this upon herself." Jenna's expression remained impassive as she watched Yvonne stagger away.

A glint of satisfaction flashed in Sylvia Savigny's eyes as she linked arms with Jenna. "Dinner's on me tonight. Order whatever you want."

"What about Vincent and the others?" Jenna asked with a smile.

"Of course they're coming." Sylvia grinned. "Let's go change first. See you this afternoon."

After seeing the sisters home, Jenna arranged for Vincent Roland and his team to rest.

By 6:30 PM, the private room at Mr. Chow was filled with mouthwatering aromas.

Just as Jenna picked up her chopsticks, her phone vibrated.

"Where are you?" Ethan's deep voice came through the receiver.

She suddenly remembered she'd forgotten to check in. "I'm having dinner with Sylvia. Want me to bring you something?"

"Don't bother. I brought braised pork knuckles."

Hanging up, Jenna noticed Sylvia giving her a hesitant look.

"What's wrong?"

Sylvia set down her chopsticks. "There's something..."

Stella cut in bluntly: "We looked into it. Ethan really—"

"It must be a misunderstanding." Jenna interrupted firmly. "He denied it himself."
###Chapter 446

"Check for yourself if you don't believe me." Stella hesitated, not daring to elaborate on Ethan's identity.

Jenna mechanically poked at her rice with chopsticks while eating in silence.

If Ethan was really the CEO of HM Group, why would he lie to her?

Grandma Blanche treated her like a granddaughter. Surely she wouldn't help Ethan keep secrets?

Unless... he hid his identity because he feared she'd marry him for money?

Jenna suddenly slammed her chopsticks down with a bitter laugh.

She pulled out her phone and searched "Ethan Roscente." The first result was his Wikipedia page.

The page clearly displayed his title as "CEO of HM Group," complete with his professional headshot in a tailored suit.

"Convinced now?" Stella watched Jenna's expression darken.

"Why would he lie to me?" Jenna's voice trembled.

Sylvia chimed in, "A man of his status would be humiliated marrying a nightclub worker. Divorce means splitting assets—anyone would lie in his position."

"I don't want his damn money!" Jenna shot to her feet.

Vincent discreetly texted Ethan: She knows.

Jenna grabbed her purse and stormed out, ignoring Sylvia's shouts as she rushed to the parking lot.

The moment she started her car, Ethan's call flashed on her screen.

She rejected it and floored the accelerator toward the nearest hotel.

Her phone rang over a dozen times during the drive. She nearly threw it out the window.

After checking in, Milo called immediately: "Sis, Ethan's going crazy looking for you!"

"Tell him I'm not coming home tonight." Her tone was glacial.

"Did you two fight?"

"How dare I argue with the mighty CEO?" Jenna hung up and hurled her phone onto the bed.

The thought of Ethan treating her like some gold-digging threat made her chest tighten.

Did he think his wealth impressed her? She'd never cared about money!

Damn you, Ethan!
###Chapter 447

Moonlight filtered through the curtains as Jenna Roland slept soundly, curled beneath the blankets.

A sharp knock shattered the silence.

She turned over, burying her face deeper into the pillow without stirring.

Outside, Ethan Roscente checked his watch impatiently before turning to the hotel manager. "Get a spare key."

Recognizing the business tycoon, the manager hurried to comply.

Ethan dismissed him with a wave and locked the door behind him.

As he approached the bed, Jenna suddenly rolled over, blinking drowsily.

"Ah!" Her scream pierced the night as she scrambled backward. "Ghost!"

His expression darkened as he flicked on the bedside lamp.

Warm light revealed his striking features.

Jenna stared, her mind blank.

"How...how did you get in?" she finally managed.

Ethan sat on the edge of the bed, his intense gaze holding hers. "About my identity—I need to explain."

"Don't bother." Her voice turned icy. "Breaking into my room at midnight is grounds for calling the police."

She clutched the blankets, her pulse still racing. Who expected to wake up to a man looming over their bed?

"This can't wait." His tone brooked no argument. "Grandma Blanche insisted I hide my identity when we married—to protect you. It wasn't deception, just delayed truth."

Jenna scoffed. "Afraid I'd gold-dig the Roscente fortune?"

"No." He shook his head. "If we divorced, courts would divide assets fairly. The secrecy was solely her request."

"A marriage built on lies?" Her voice hardened. "Let's end this."

Ethan's breath caught. He'd rushed here to reassure her, only to hear the word "divorce."

He seized her hand. "I'll transfer my HM Group shares to you. Jenna, I love you. Don't do this."

"Love?" She pulled free. "Would the Roscentes ever accept an ex-escort as family? Let's part cleanly before this gets ugly."

Panic flashed in his eyes. "What will convince you?"

"Simple." She met his gaze squarely. "Sign the papers."
###Chapter 448

Jenna's fingers clenched the edge of the blanket, her knuckles turning white.

The weight of Ethan's true identity crushed her chest like a boulder, making it hard to breathe. CEO of HM Group? The mastermind behind a billion-dollar empire?

She suddenly found it laughable.

"Jenna..."

"Get out." Her voice was ice. "I need to rest."

Ethan remained motionless by the bed. Moonlight seeped through the curtains, casting shadows across his sharp features.

"I said get out!" She hurled a pillow at him.

It grazed his shoulder and landed on the floor. He picked it up silently and placed it back on the bed.

"We'll talk tomorrow." He turned and left, the door clicking shut behind him.

Jenna stared at the ceiling, tears sliding down her temples.

Ethan's car sped through the night. The dashboard's blue glow highlighted his tense jawline. The steering wheel creaked under his grip.

The Roscente mansion blazed with lights.

"What's happened at this hour?" Benjamin descended the stairs in his robe, Grace close behind.

Grandpa Harrison emerged from the elevator, his expression stormy. "This better be important."

Ethan stood in the center of the living room, his voice rough. "Jenna wants a divorce."

The air froze.

Grandma Blanche nearly dropped her teacup. "What?"

"She knows I'm HM Group's CEO." He loosened his tie. "Thinks I've been deceiving her."

Grace gasped. "Yvonne told her?"

Ethan nodded.

Grandpa Harrison's cane struck the floor with a crack. "I warned you the truth would come out!"

"Enough recriminations!" Grandma Blanche wrung her hands. "We'll go explain tomorrow."

Ethan's phone lit up. A location notification from Jenna—City Hall.

"No time." His voice tightened. "She wants to meet at nine tomorrow morning."

Benjamin frowned. "Calm down first. We can—"

"How can I calm down?" Ethan's voice rose before he forcibly reined it in. "Sorry."

Grace squeezed his shoulder. "Rest first. We'll go with you tomorrow."

At 5 AM, Ethan finally closed his eyes. His dreams were filled with Jenna's retreating figure.
###Chapter 449

Morning sunlight streamed through the hotel room curtains.

Jenna Roland skipped her planned trip to Beverly Hills. Instead, she found a quiet breakfast spot near the hotel. The steaming soy milk and freshly fried dough sticks offered temporary solace.

After breakfast, she inexplicably drove to an orchard on the outskirts of town.

Peach trees bore unripe fruit. Jenna rolled up her sleeves and joined the farmers in pruning branches. Sweat trickled down her face, yet she felt strangely at peace.

"Jenna."

That familiar voice made her turn. Ethan Roscente was approaching with a group along the mountain path.

As they drew closer, Jenna's breath caught. Behind Ethan stood his parents—and grandparents.

Her pruning shears clattered to the ground.

Grandma Blanche stepped forward first. "Child, Ethan told us everything. It was my decision to conceal his identity that led to your divorce."

The elderly woman grasped Jenna's hands with wrinkled fingers. "In all my years, character matters most. Your grandmother always praised your kindness—that's why I arranged this."

Grandpa Harrison tapped his cane forward. "The Roscentes never choose brides for their lineage. Your grandmother said you were thoughtful and filial—that sealed our approval."

Jenna's fingertips trembled.

Benjamin Roscente sighed. "We were wrong to hide the truth. But please believe our family genuinely welcomes you."

Grace Roscente gently took Jenna's hand. "Ethan's always been reserved—never showed interest in any girl. Until you."

Sunlight glistened on Jenna's damp lashes. "But I—"

"Silly child." Grandma Blanche pulled her into an embrace. "Do you know what Ethan said after first bringing you to meet us?"

Jenna looked up, bewildered.

"'She's the one.'" The old woman wiped tears from Jenna's cheeks. "This boy's been stubborn since childhood—once his mind's set, nothing changes it."

Ethan stood a short distance away, his gaze burning into her.

A mountain breeze swept through the orchard, rustling leaves into emerald waves. As Jenna studied the sincere faces before her, something icy in her chest began to thaw.
###Chapter 450

Jenna's fingers clenched the fabric of her dress, her knuckles turning white. She took a deep breath, scanning every face in the room.

"Ethan probably didn't tell you this," her voice trembled, "but I used to work as a beverage promoter at a nightclub. That kind of place... it's not respectable. If word got out, it would damage the Roscente family's reputation. For your sake, I should divorce Ethan."

Benjamin Roscente chuckled warmly. "Ethan told us everything this morning. We understand you were raising funds for your brother's surgery."

Grandma Blanche grasped her hand. "Sweetheart, there's no shame in earning an honest living. As long as your conscience is clear, who dares to judge?"

Jenna's pupils contracted slightly. She never expected the Roscentes to already know—let alone accept her so readily.

(Ethan had deliberately informed his family this morning to spare her embarrassment.)

"But I'm not worthy—" Jenna bit her lower lip.

Grandma Blanche cut her off. "You and Ethan are a match made in heaven." She winked. "We're still waiting for great-grandchildren!"

Jenna's eyes grew warm. Insisting on divorce now would only betray their sincerity.

Turning to Ethan's parents, she bowed deeply. "Thank you for accepting me. From now on, I'll honor our family alongside Ethan."

A collective sigh of relief filled the living room.

Grandma Blanche pulled her into a tight embrace. "Silly girl, Grandma will always be on your side." Suddenly, she punched Ethan's arm. "If he ever mistreats you, I'll break his legs myself!"

Jenna's eyes widened. The punch had been delivered with full force, no holds barred.

Rubbing his shoulder, Ethan approached and interlaced their fingers. "Will you stay married to me now?"

"Only if your heart remains true," Jenna whispered.

When Ethan opened his mouth to swear an oath, she pressed a finger to his lips. "No jinxes."

Turning to their expectant family, she announced, "Come to Beverly Hills for lunch today. I'll cook."
###Chapter 451

Sunlight filtered through the fruit trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground. Jenna Roland rolled up her sleeves and crouched by the vegetable patch.

Her fingers were smudged with soil as she looked up at Grandma Blanche with a smile. "I'll cook dinner tonight. Something special for everyone."

Grandma Blanche's eyes brightened, her wrinkles smoothing with delight. "That's wonderful! We've all been craving your cooking."

Jenna stood, brushing dirt from her hands. "The orchard is lovely. Why don't you all take a walk first? I'll finish up here, and then we can head home."

The word "home" warmed everyone's hearts. Grace Roscente glanced at her son and suggested, "Let Ethan help you with the work."

Jenna's ears turned pink. She waved her hands quickly. "No, no. He wouldn't know how to do this kind of labor." Ever since learning Ethan was the heir to the Roscente Group, she couldn't bring herself to ask him for help.

But Grandma Blanche had already knelt and started pulling weeds with practiced ease. "Ethan, take your parents for a stroll. I'll help Jenna."

"Grandma!" Jenna rushed to help her up. "Please, let me handle this."

Grandma Blanche worked briskly, not looking up. "Moving around is good for me. The air here is fresh. Working is a pleasure."

A breeze carried the scent of grass and ripening fruit. Unable to refuse the elderly woman, Jenna joined her in weeding.

Amid the sound of the hoe turning soil, Grandma Blanche spoke suddenly. "Jenna, last night Ethan came back saying you wanted a divorce. My heart..." She sighed. "What do those society girls matter? To me, you're the only one worthy of him."

Jenna's fingers stilled. Softly, she said, "Grandma, I won't divorce him."

Grandma Blanche smiled in relief, though her brow remained furrowed. After a pause, she asked hesitantly, "Do you know about Ethan's past girlfriend?"

"I know." Jenna's voice was calm as she continued weeding. She still remembered the name Ethan had called out drunkenly at the club that night.

The earthy scent lingered between them as sunlight stretched their shadows long. From deep in the orchard, the sound of Ethan and his family laughing drifted faintly on the wind.
###Chapter 452

Ethan had confessed to Jenna that Yvonne Sherwood was his first love from his youth, now nothing more than a distant memory.

When Jenna mentioned Yvonne's name, Grandma Blanche paused mid-motion, the hoe in her hand hovering slightly.

"Where did you hear that?"

"Ethan mentioned her once when he had too much to drink at a business dinner." Jenna plucked at the weeds by her feet. "He explained everything afterward."

Grandma Blanche straightened up, dusting the soil from her hands. "If that girl dares to come back and cause trouble, don't hold back. If she makes a scene, I'll stand by you!"

Jenna's fingers dug unconsciously into her palms. "But... what if Ethan still has feelings for her?"

"Impossible!" Grandma Blanche said firmly. "That boy married you, and he'll take responsibility for you till the end."

The elderly woman suddenly swung the hoe in a mock chopping motion. "If he dares wrong you, I'll break his legs myself!"

Jenna laughed, though her eyes grew slightly red. "You can't force matters of the heart."

"Silly child," Grandma Blanche said affectionately, patting her head. "Ethan is loyal. Once he sets his mind on someone, it's for life."

By noon, Ethan returned with his parents from touring the orchard.

Jenna checked the time and stood. "Mom, Dad, I'll go buy some groceries. You should head back and rest."

"Let Ethan go with you," Grandma Blanche insisted.

Ethan took over smoothly. "Give the house keys to Mom and Dad."

On their way down the hill, Jenna realized the car keys were on the same ring.

At the market, Ethan silently took all the shopping bags from her, the heavy groceries seeming weightless in his hands.

In the car on the way back, Ethan spoke suddenly. "What my parents said... it's what I wanted to say too."

Jenna rubbed her arms exaggeratedly. "So corny. I'm getting goosebumps."

Ethan glanced at her fair skin, where tiny bumps had indeed appeared, and chuckled. "You dislike hearing the truth?"

"It's because it's too sincere that it's overwhelming." Jenna tilted her head to look at him, her eyes shimmering. "As long as you don't change your heart, I'll never leave you in this lifetime."

Ethan tightened his grip on the steering wheel, his voice deep and steady. "Ethan Roscente will only ever have one wife—Jenna Roland."

Sunlight streamed through the window, warming their intertwined hands with its golden glow.
###Chapter 453

Jenna Roland pushed open the door to the sound of laughter drifting from the living room.

Grandma Blanche and Grace Roscente sat on the sofa, chatting while watching TV.

"You're back?" Grace looked up with a warm smile.

Jenna nodded, her lips curving slightly.

She set down her bag and headed straight for the kitchen.

Ethan Roscente followed close behind, his tall frame disappearing through the kitchen doorway.

"Since when does he go into the kitchen?" Benjamin Roscente raised an eyebrow in surprise.

Grandma Blanche's eyes crinkled with amusement. "He's Jenna's little helper now—washing dishes, wiping tables, you name it."

"No way." Grace couldn't help but laugh.

"Absolutely true." Grandma Blanche patted her knee. "That boy is a completely different person now."

Grandpa Harrison Roscente set down his teacup and cleared his throat. "Now that Jenna knows Ethan's identity, we should plan the wedding."

"Yes!" Benjamin chimed in immediately. "We need to discuss the ceremony details."

"It must be a traditional Chinese wedding," Grandpa Harrison declared firmly.

In the kitchen, Jenna chopped vegetables.

Ethan stood beside her, handling ingredients with practiced ease.

Working in perfect sync, they soon prepared six dishes and a soup.

"Dinner's ready." Ethan carried out the dishes.

The dining table was laden with aromatic food as everyone gathered around.

Grandpa Harrison picked up a piece of braised pork and suddenly announced, "Ethan, Jenna—we're planning your wedding."

Jenna's chopsticks stilled. She looked up, startled. "So soon?"

"It's not soon at all," Grace said gently. "You deserve to have your place recognized."

Benjamin added, "Just tell us what you want. We'll handle everything else."

Jenna pressed her lips together, her eyes flickering with emotion.

"My...my parents are gone," she said softly. "I don't have many relatives—just Milo and a few friends who'd attend."

Grandma Blanche patted her hand. "Don't worry, dear. You have us now."

Ethan grasped Jenna's hand, his gaze steady. "I'll take care of everything."

Surrounded by their expectant faces, Jenna finally nodded.
###Chapter 454

Grandma Blanche patted Jenna's hand affectionately. "Don't worry about the wedding arrangements, dear. We'll take care of everything."

Ethan tapped the table with his long fingers. "Do you prefer a traditional or Western-style wedding?"

"Traditional," Jenna answered without hesitation.

Grandpa Harrison's eyes lit up. "Excellent! We'll do it the proper way!"

Jenna suddenly remembered something. "The fruits in the orchard are almost ripe. We could use them for the wedding."

"That's a wonderful idea." Grandpa Harrison beamed.

After dinner, Ethan began clearing the dishes. Jenna followed him into the kitchen, where they worked side by side, washing and drying in comfortable silence.

In the living room, heated discussions erupted. Grandma Blanche and Grandpa Harrison were passionately debating wedding details while Benjamin and Grace stood by helplessly.

Grace suddenly pulled out a gold card and pressed it into Jenna's hand. "Here's half a million for your personal expenses."

Jenna took a step back in shock. "Mom, this is too much!"

"Take it." Grace firmly closed Jenna's fingers around the card. "The PIN is six zeros. Spend it however you like."

Tears welled in Jenna's eyes as she hugged her mother-in-law. "You're too kind to me. Just tell me what you'd like to eat, and I'll make it for you."

Grandpa Harrison chimed in, "You're always welcome to move back here."

"We'll stay where we are." Ethan draped an arm around Jenna's shoulders. "It's quieter."

After seeing their relatives off, Jenna stared at the burning-hot bank card uncertainly. "This money..."

"Keep what Mom gave you." Ethan lit a cigarette, his gaze softening through the smoke. "Buy whatever you want."

Jenna looked down at the card, warmth flooding her chest. She stole a glance at the man beside her, grateful she hadn't let him slip away.

Ethan exhaled a smoke ring and suddenly ruffled her hair. "What are you thinking about?"

"Nothing." Jenna leaned into his embrace. "Just how lucky I am to have met all of you."

Outside, the setting sun stretched their intertwined shadows long across the floor.
###Chapter 455

Tiffany's ears burned as waves of shrieks surrounded her. She shot Vincent a glare before covering her ears in feigned ignorance.

The final note of "Love You for Ten Thousand Years" faded. Vincent strode toward Tiffany and dropped to one knee, extending the microphone. "Sweetie, let me protect you forever. Will you?"

Rose petals formed a heart around them—a scene straight out of every girl's fantasy. Several female classmates dabbed at their eyes, while others stomped their feet in excitement.

"I will!" Lily suddenly shrieked. Once the class belle, she'd been overshadowed since Tiffany's transfer. Jealousy coiled like a venomous serpent in her chest as she watched the public proposal unfold.

Vincent ignored her. When Tiffany remained silent, he pulled a crumpled note from his pocket.

"Classmates, my sweetheart is shy." He cleared his throat under the spotlight. "So I'll recite a modern poem to bare my heart!"

"Oh my god, so romantic!"
"I wish someone would confess to me like this!"

Vincent straightened his posture under their expectant gazes. "Tiffany, you're the brightest star in my sky. If you love singing, I'll sing until my voice gives out. If you crave snacks, I'll empty every supermarket. Even if you become as round as a piglet, I'll—"

Peals of laughter erupted. Even the usually stoic Ethan turned away.

What kind of poem was this?

It got worse. Lines like "I'll stay even if you're disfigured or disabled" followed. Vincent's knuckles whitened around the note as mocking laughter surrounded him.

He'd envisioned himself as a fairytale prince. Now he was the punchline. The humiliation ignited his fury.

"Shut the hell up!" Vincent roared, smashing the microphone before storming offstage. He seized bodyguard Hank by the collar. "This is the romantic poem you found?"

Hank looked sheepish. With only a middle school education, he'd just Googled something random.

Vincent became an unhinged beast, raining punches on Hank. After a dozen blows, Hank collapsed, blood streaming down his face.

"Useless trash! Get lost!" Vincent delivered a final kick.

The carefully planned confession had devolved into farce. Tiffany tugged Ethan's sleeve. "Ethan, this lunatic's lost it. Let's go."

Vincent lunged for her. "Don't leave! Save my face!"

Ethan moved like lightning, swatting his wrist away.

"You're dead!" Vincent swung wildly.

"Scram." Ethan's counterpunch connected with his chest first.

Vincent flew backward, caught by two gray-clad men. "Easton, Weston—cripple him!"

"Young Master, the family head's orders..." They hesitated.

Vincent's face darkened. Lily rushed over in stilettos. "Vincent, let me take you to the hospital!"

She whirled on Ethan. "You pathetic freeloader! How dare you hit someone?"

"Yeah! Shameless!" her clique chimed in.

Tiffany opened her mouth to retort, but Ethan gently restrained her.
###Chapter 456

"I stayed up all night terrified you'd ask for a divorce. I barely fell asleep at five AM, only to be woken at eight when they came looking for you."

Ethan's voice was heavy with exhaustion, his eyelids like lead weights. He forced them open, unwilling to miss a single nuance of her expression.

"Let's go."

Jenna's heart skipped. She hadn't expected him to care so deeply about her absence.

She mattered this much to him.

Back in their bedroom, Jenna lay quietly beside him. Ethan fell asleep instantly, his arm locked around her waist. She didn't dare move, afraid to disturb him.

Sunlight slanted westward as Jenna drifted into a light doze.

When she opened her eyes again, the wall clock read 3 PM.

"Oh no," Jenna murmured. "I'll never sleep tonight."

Ethan rubbed his eyes as he sat up, his voice rough with sleep. "What time is it?"

"Three," Jenna said, sitting up beside him. "You missed work this morning. Still going in?"

"Light schedule today." He threw off the covers. "Just need to splash some water on my face."

The cold water finally chased away his drowsiness.

Jenna waited in the living room. "If you're not going to the office, come to the orchard with me."

"Okay." Ethan headed to the kitchen. "Let me grab some water first."

He drained the glass in one go. Jenna stood by the entryway with her bag, watching him wipe droplets from his lips.

......

Two weeks later, Grandma Blanche's late-night call shattered the bedroom's tranquility.

"The wedding photo studio is booked." Ethan hung up and turned to Jenna. "When are you free?"

"That's my line." Jenna bit her lip. "You're the busy one... Actually, I need to visit the hospital tomorrow."

Ethan's spine went rigid. "Are you sick?"

His gaze suggested he was seconds away from dialing 911.

"My period's two weeks late, and I've been exhausted." Jenna avoided his intense stare. "Online says it could be hormonal imbalance. Just want to check."

Ethan exhaled in relief.

"I'll go with you."

"No, you have meetings." Jenna insisted. "Stella can take me."

What she couldn't say aloud: What if it's something worse...

Ethan's brow furrowed, but he yielded to her stubborn expression. "Call me immediately if anything's wrong."

As night deepened, Jenna stared at the ceiling, fingers twisting the sheets.
###Chapter 457

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains into the bedroom. Jenna Roland rubbed her sleepy eyes and picked up her phone to call Stella Laurent.

"Wait for me at home. I'll be there in half an hour." She hung up after the brief message.

After freshening up, Jenna drove her white sedan toward Stella's place. The streets were quiet at dawn, and she arrived quickly.

Stella stood at the gated community entrance in an oversized hoodie. She hurried over when she spotted Jenna's car.

"Why the sudden check-up?" Stella asked, buckling her seatbelt.

Jenna turned the wheel toward the hospital. "I've been so busy lately. Only noticed yesterday that my period is two weeks late."

Stella's eyes widened. "Two weeks? You're so careless! I'd panic after just three days."

"The orchard keeps me swamped." Jenna kept her eyes on the road. "I completely forgot until I checked my schedule last night."

Stella leaned closer. "Could it be... you're pregnant?"

"Impossible." Jenna's tone was firm. "Ethan and I are always careful. And it's not like we do it often."

"Don't be so sure." Stella pursed her lips. "Last time, I found out after just five days. Two weeks means higher chances."

Jenna's grip on the wheel tightened slightly. "I hadn't considered that."

"Understandable. It's your first relationship." Stella patted her shoulder. "Ask me anytime if you're unsure."

After a pause, Stella suddenly asked, "If you really are pregnant, what will you do?"

Jenna frowned. "It's not the right time. I just took over the orchard. There's too much to handle."

"Don't be silly!" Stella exclaimed. "Ethan's loaded! He could hire ten nannies. A baby matters more than some orchard!"

"It was my parents' life work." Jenna's voice lowered. "I have to make it thrive."

"Pregnancy won't stop you from managing it." Stella persisted. "Besides, it's a life. Such a waste to terminate!"

Jenna stayed silent, but her resolve wavered. She did love children. A baby with Ethan...

They reached the hospital quickly. Blood tests, ultrasounds—by the time the exams finished, Jenna's palms were damp with sweat.

"Results are in!" Stella snatched the ultrasound report. After one glance, she shrieked, "Oh my God! You're really pregnant!"

Jenna stood frozen, mind blank. Mechanically, she took the paper. The words were unmistakable: Early pregnancy, approximately 6 weeks.

"Congratulations, mama-to-be!" Stella hugged her excitedly. "This is incredible news!"

Jenna's fingers trembled as she instinctively touched her flat abdomen. A new life was growing there.
###Chapter 458

Jenna Roland stared at the test results in her hands, her fingertips trembling slightly.

Stella Laurent peeked over her shoulder and immediately beamed. "See? I told you it was positive!"

"Let's wait for the doctor's confirmation." Jenna took a deep breath, her voice tight with tension.

They went to the second-floor lab, where the wait for the blood test results felt agonizingly long.

Thirty minutes later, a nurse handed them the report.

Inside the doctor's office, Jenna held her breath, her nerves on edge.

"Congratulations." The doctor adjusted his glasses. "You're five weeks pregnant, and the embryo is developing well."

Jenna froze, her ears ringing.

She was really pregnant?

But she and Ethan had only been together a few times...

"Doctor, we... didn't do it that often..." Jenna murmured, her cheeks flushing.

The doctor smiled kindly. "Pregnancy is about fate. Sometimes once is enough."

Stella chimed in, "Her husband adores her. This baby will definitely stay."

"Take folic acid regularly and come in for prenatal checkups." The doctor scribbled a prescription. "Stay happy and relaxed."

Jenna nodded mechanically. As she walked out of the office with the prescription, she felt lightheaded.

Even in the car, she was still dazed.

"Tell Ethan the good news!" Stella urged.

Jenna bit her lip and dialed his number, but suddenly, she didn’t know how to say it.

On the other end, Ethan Roscente sensed her hesitation, and his heart sank.
###Chapter 459

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of HM Group's top-floor office, bathing the space in warm radiance.

Ethan Roscente's slender fingers tapped lightly on the desk as his gaze lingered on his phone screen. He had just received a message from Jenna Roland—her test results were in.

"How did it go?" His voice was deep and tender.

Jenna's hesitant voice came through the phone. "The doctor said... I'm pregnant."

Ethan's fingers froze mid-air. His pupils dilated slightly. He stood abruptly, his suit jacket fluttering from the sudden movement.

"Are you sure?" His voice tightened.

"Yes. Both the blood test and ultrasound confirmed it." Jenna's voice was feather-light. "Six weeks along."

Ethan drew a sharp breath, his chest filling with warmth. He strode to the window, staring at the distant city skyline.

"Where are you now?" His voice betrayed urgency.

"Just left the hospital. Heading home." She paused. "Are you... okay?"

A low chuckle escaped him. "I'm fine. More than fine. Go rest. I'll wrap up here and come home soon."

"Should I prepare lunch?"

"No." His tone brooked no argument. "You're not stepping into the kitchen today. We'll go out or order in."

Jenna's soft laughter floated through the line. "Alright. Your call."

After hanging up, Ethan remained still for a moment before suddenly dialing Grandma Blanche's number.

"Grandma." Joy seeped into his words. "Jenna's pregnant."

In the Roscente family estate, the midday news played on TV. Grandma Blanche squinted at her phone. "What? Say that again?"

"Jenna's pregnant!" Ethan raised his voice. "Confirmed this morning."

Grandma Blanche slapped the armrest, startling Grandpa Harrison beside her.

"Old man! Turn off the TV!" she exclaimed. "Jenna's pregnant!"

Grandpa Harrison fumbled with the remote, disbelief etched on his face. "Already? They just got married!"

"Absolutely certain!" Grandma Blanche was already calling Grace Roscente. "Grace, come over immediately! Earth-shattering news!"

Within half an hour, Grace and Benjamin Roscente arrived at the estate. Grandma Blanche clutched her daughter's hand, beaming. "Jenna's pregnant! The Roscente family is growing!"

Grace gasped, covering her mouth. "Heavens! I must prepare tonics for her."

Benjamin patted his wife's shoulder, eyes crinkling with pride. "That boy works fast."

The Roscente estate buzzed with excitement, every face alight with happiness. Meanwhile, Ethan stood by his office window, gazing at the horizon, an unconscious smile curving his lips.
###Chapter 460

Jenna's pupils constricted abruptly, her fingers unconsciously clutching the hem of her shirt.

Benjamin Roscente shot to his feet, his voice trembling. "She's really pregnant? Is the news confirmed?"

Grandma Blanche beamed with joy. "Ethan told us himself. It must be true. Jenna just got back from the hospital. Let's go to the supermarket and pick up some things before heading to Beverly Hills to see her."

"Let's go now!" Benjamin grabbed his car keys impatiently.

They had waited far too long for this grandchild. Their excitement was palpable as they practically flew out the door.

The four of them rushed to a high-end supermarket, filling their cart with bird's nest, ginseng, and abalone. Benjamin even detoured to the snack aisle to grab a dozen packs of nuts—perfect for pregnancy cravings.

The door to the Beverly Hills home was slightly ajar, clearly left open on Ethan's instructions.

"Jenna?" Grandma Blanche called softly.

The bedroom door opened, and Jenna emerged in loungewear. She paused mid-step at the sight of the four elders in her living room.

"What brings you here?" She hurried forward. "Please, have a seat."

Grace Roscente guided her to the couch, her gaze tender. "Ethan told us you're expecting. We couldn't wait to see you."

Jenna hadn't expected Ethan to share the news so quickly. The tips of her ears warmed.

Grace clasped her hands firmly. "You're our top priority now. No overexerting yourself."

"Mom, I'm fine," Jenna reassured with a smile.

"And if Ethan ever upsets you," Grace patted her hand, "just let us know. We'll set him straight."

Grandpa Harrison gestured to the mountain of premium supplements by the door. "These are all for you. When you run out, tell Ethan to restock."

Jenna eyed the lavish gifts, touched yet slightly overwhelmed.

"How about we all have dinner together when Ethan gets back?" Grace suggested.

Grandma Blanche hesitated before speaking up. "Jenna, would you consider moving back to the family estate? We have housekeepers to take care of you."

The room fell silent.

Jenna pressed her lips together. "Grandma, I'm comfortable living here. It feels more... like home."

Her words were direct but sincere. The four elders exchanged glances, understanding passing between them.

Grandma Blanche nodded warmly. "Of course. Young couples need their own space."

Benjamin suddenly remembered something, pulling out his phone. "I should call Ethan. Tell him to come home early."
###Chapter 461

Jenna hesitated about moving back in.

Grandma Blanche smiled warmly. "This is your home with Ethan. Stay as long as you like."

Grace chimed in, "We're mainly concerned about you being alone. How about hiring a housekeeper?"

With Ethan at work and Milo at boarding school, Jenna would be by herself. Considering her frequent orchard visits, Grace thought a caretaker was necessary.

Jenna waved her hands. "No need for extra expenses. I can manage."

Grandpa Harrison spoke gravely, "Your grandmother and mother worry about you. We can't rest easy knowing you're pregnant and alone."

Jenna bit her lip. She couldn't be stubborn—not with a baby on the way.

"Then... someone younger, please. Someone who can accompany me outside."

Grace's eyes lit up. "Do you have a close friend? We could invite them to stay with you, plus hire a separate cook for meal planning."

"My best friend Stella," Jenna's eyes curved, "I was going to ask her to help at the orchard. She'd love to stay with me."

Grace decided immediately. "Invite your friend. We'll pay her $20,000 a month."

Jenna's eyes widened. She knew the Roscentes were wealthy, but this was excessive!

Noticing her shock, Grace explained gently, "For good friends, we should be generous."

"Okay..." Jenna nodded. "I'll call her later."

"Are you hungry?" Grace checked her watch. "Shall we wait for Ethan at the restaurant?"

Jenna shook her head. "I had a big breakfast. Let's wait here." She felt awkward alone with elders.

Grace understood and took out her phone. "I'll ask when that boy is coming home."

Ethan said he'd arrive soon. Thirty minutes later, he appeared at the door.

When leaving for the restaurant, the elders tactfully let the couple ride together.

Jenna glanced at the chauffeur and teased, "No more pretending, Mr. Roscente?"

"Hmm?" Ethan raised a brow.

"First an Audi, now a Maybach with a driver." She poked his chest. "Dropping the act after your big reveal?"

Ethan pulled her close, eyes smiling. "Necessity before. Now you get only the best."

Leaning against him, Jenna mentioned, "Your mom wants to hire Stella as my companion. Offered $20K monthly."

"Make it thirty," Ethan said without hesitation.

"You're insane!" Jenna sat up straight. "Twenty is already too much!"
###Chapter 462

"Let me check with her first." Jenna Roland pulled out her phone from her bag, scrolling through her contacts until she found Stella Laurent's name.

She got straight to the point when the call connected.

"Twenty thousand?" Stella's voice shot up an octave. "That's too much. Fifteen would be enough. But..." She lowered her voice. "I want free meals from you."

Jenna's cooking had left an indelible impression on her. She'd do it for free just to taste it again.

"Twenty," Jenna said firmly. "The nutritionist will handle my meals. I won't be cooking anymore."

"What?!" Stella's shriek nearly ruptured Jenna's eardrum.

Jenna held the phone away. "Keep it down."

"What a shame..." Stella clicked her tongue. "But a nutritionist is better for a pregnant woman."

"So, are you in?"

"Only an idiot would say no!"

"Have your sister take over the orchard management. Same salary—twenty thousand."

"Deal!"

After hanging up, Jenna turned to Ethan Roscente. "Done. Her sister will handle the orchard. One less thing to worry about."

Ethan squeezed her hand. "The orchard has fresh air. Good for relaxation."

A black Maybach glided to a stop in front of a Michelin-starred restaurant.

A waiter escorted them to a private dining room. Grace Roscente wasted no time. "Did your friend agree?"

"Yes." Jenna tucked her phone back into her bag. "Her sister will manage the orchard."

Grace smiled approvingly before shooting Ethan a warning look. "Stock up on snacks at home. If I find out you've been mistreating Jenna..."

Ethan arched a brow. "I cherish her too much for that."

He wrapped an arm around Jenna's waist, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. Jenna's ears turned pink as she gently pushed him away.

Grace opened her mouth to speak when her phone rang. She frowned at the caller ID. "We're at dinner. Not now."

Sophie Roscente's voice pierced through the receiver. "Mom! You're having a family meal without me?"

"Nightclub regulars forfeit complaint rights." Grace rattled off the restaurant address and hung up.

Ethan smirked. "Clubbing again?"

"Worry about your own wife." Grace glared at him before placing a piece of sweet-and-sour pork ribs on Jenna's plate.
###Chapter 463

Sophie Roscente arrived at the restaurant to find the lunch spread already laid out for Jenna Roland and the family. Grace Roscente had thoughtfully ordered her a steak set.

As Sophie cut into her steak, she asked curiously, "Mom, what's the occasion? The whole family's here."

Grace beamed. "Your sister-in-law is expecting."

Sophie's knife and fork froze mid-air. She turned to Jenna in surprise. "Really?"

Grace patted her hand. "Would I joke about something like this?"

Sophie stuck out her tongue. "It's just so sudden! I didn't see it coming."

Jenna smiled softly. "We just confirmed it at the hospital."

"Oh my god!" Sophie's eyes sparkled. "I'm going to be an aunt?"

Jenna nodded.

"This is amazing!" Sophie excitedly placed a piece of fish on Jenna's plate. "Eat more. It's good for the baby."

Grandma Blanche said warmly, "A new addition to the family is truly a blessing."

Sophie suddenly remembered something. "Weren't you two planning the wedding? Should we postpone it now? The first trimester is crucial."

Grace gasped in realization. "You're right! We should hold off on the wedding photos too. We can take them after the baby arrives."

Grandma Blanche chuckled. "We'll have a lovely family portrait then."

"Okay," Jenna agreed gently.

Though her own parents were gone, the Roscente family had given her boundless warmth. She thought her parents in heaven must be at peace now.

After the meal, the elders tactfully excused themselves to give the newlyweds some privacy.

Ethan Roscente escorted Jenna back to their apartment and, unusually, didn't rush back to the office.

On the couch, he held her hand tightly, his gaze tender. "I never imagined I'd be a father. I can't wait."

Jenna scrolled through pregnancy tips on her phone and murmured, "It's still early. Don't get too excited yet."

Ethan frowned. "Don't say such things. Our baby will be perfectly healthy."

"Fine, fine." Jenna yawned. "I'm sleepy. Want to nap with me?"

She'd been unusually tired lately, mistaking it for work exhaustion before realizing it was the pregnancy.

"I'll stay with you." Though not tired himself, Ethan couldn't bear to leave her side.

In the bedroom, Jenna's eyes watered as she yawned again the moment her head hit the pillow. She clung to Ethan's arm. "I'm going to sleep now."

"Sleep well." He kissed her forehead.

Jenna drifted off quickly. When Ethan's phone vibrated, he silenced it immediately. He'd planned to slip away once she was asleep, but she held onto him like a vise. Not wanting to wake her, he stayed put until three in the afternoon.

When Jenna finally stirred, she blinked in confusion. "Why aren't you at work?"

Ethan gave her a wry look.

How could she even ask? She'd used him as a human pillow all afternoon, leaving him no escape.
###Chapter 464

"I don't have plans this afternoon. It's optional."

Ethan Roscente flexed his numb arm. Only after Jenna Roland released him did he realize his entire limb had gone stiff.

"Ouch..."

Jenna blinked apologetically. "Sorry for using your arm as a pillow so long."

"It's fine." Ethan lay flat on the bed, taking slow breaths to recover.

Jenna rubbed her stomach. "I'm starving. Let's order takeout. What do you want?"

"Not hungry. Just order for yourself."

"Then I'll get stinky noodles. Suddenly craving something strong-flavored."

Ethan had never heard of this dish but let her proceed. After she placed the order, he immediately transferred fifty thousand via WeChat.

"Keep some cash in your phone for whenever you want food."

"Your mom just gave me money a few days ago. I haven't touched it yet."

"That's in the bank account. Too inconvenient without mobile payment."

"True. Thanks."

"If you weren't pregnant, I'd have to properly 'educate' you for saying that."

"Haha, the baby's my protective charm now."

"Better remember that."

"I'm going to wash my face."

Jenna stepped into the bathroom. The cold water splashed against her skin, clearing her grogginess.

When she emerged drying her face, Ethan was on a call in the living room.

She quietly sat beside him.

After he hung up, she whispered, "Who was it?"

"Company matter. I need to go in."

"Go ahead."

Ethan kissed her forehead. "Be good at home. Call a friend if you want to go out. See you tonight."

"Okay."

As the door clicked shut, Jenna curled on the sofa scrolling through her phone. The food arrived quickly. She ate leisurely, about to call Stella Laurent when an unknown number flashed on her screen.

"Hello, this is Jenna Roland."

"Miss Roland, it's Vanessa Galatea. You remember me, right?"

Jenna's fingers froze. Of course she remembered that name—just not why this woman would contact her.

"Can I help you, Miss Galatea?"

"Mind adding me on WeChat? I have something important to show you." A pause. "You can delete me right after."

"Fine."

Jenna copied the number and sent a friend request. The moment it was accepted, photos and videos flooded their chat.

When the images loaded, her pupils contracted violently.

Ice flooded her veins.
###Chapter 465

Jenna Roland's fingers clenched around her phone, knuckles turning white. The photo on the screen burned her eyes, sending uncontrollable tears streaming down her face.

With trembling hands, she opened the video sent by Vanessa Galatea. The footage showed Ethan Roscente sitting in a corner of a coffee shop with a stunningly beautiful girl. The way the girl gazed at him was filled with undisguised admiration.

Jenna immediately exited the app and dialed Ethan's number.

"Jenna?" His warm voice came through the receiver. "Did you have lunch yet?"

That familiar tone made her tears flow even harder. She bit her lip hard, suppressing a sob. "Are... you at the office?"

"In a meeting," Ethan replied with a chuckle. "Why the sudden check-in?"

His gentle voice now sounded unbearably mocking. Jenna thought of Ethan's prestigious family background—of course, a man like him could have any woman he wanted.

She hung up without another word, ignoring the vibrating phone in her palm. Storming into the bedroom, she threw her belongings into a suitcase and left the apartment without looking back.

Inside the taxi, she called Milo Roland.

"Don't go back to Beverly Hills tonight. Stay at a hotel for a few days." Her voice trembled with unshed tears.

"Sis, what's wrong?" Milo instantly grew alarmed. "Did Ethan hurt you?"

That question shattered Jenna's composure. She broke down completely. "Vanessa sent me photos... Ethan was... meeting another woman at a coffee shop..."

"Wait!" Milo cut in urgently. "Maybe it's just a friend? Ethan isn't that kind of guy."

"He lied about being at the office!" Jenna's voice rose sharply. "If he had nothing to hide, why lie? Vanessa likes him so much—why would she send me those photos for no reason?"

"That Vanessa is obviously trying to stir up trouble!" Milo sounded frantic. "Don't act rashly. I'll call Ethan right now and get the truth!"

Before Jenna could stop him, Milo ended the call. He immediately dialed Ethan's number and demanded without preamble, "Ethan, someone took photos of you with a woman at a coffee shop. What the hell is going on?"
###Chapter 466

Ethan's fingers tightened around his phone.

Milo's words sent a chill down his spine.

If Milo knew, then Jenna must have found out too...

"Where's your sister now? Is she okay?"

"She's furious. She thinks you're cheating on her with that woman. Told me to stay at the hotel while she looks for a new place. Seriously, Ethan, who is she? You'd better explain fast, or my sister will file for divorce within three days!"

Ethan massaged his temples, his voice low. "It's Yvonne Sherwood. My ex. She's been abroad for years and just returned."

"Don't tell me—go fix things with Jenna. Class is starting. Bye."

Ethan immediately dialed Jenna's number.

The first call went straight to voicemail.

She picked up on the second try.

"What?" Her voice was icy.

"Let me explain. The woman at the café was Yvonne. She came back unexpectedly, claiming she had to tell me the truth about why she left. She also asked me to help her find a place to stay."

"Ah, your old flame. Did you say yes?"

"No. I knew you wouldn't like it, so I refused. The work emergency was real—she called me afterward." He paused. "I just sent you the call log."

Jenna opened the screenshot.

The timestamp showed the call came after she'd ordered takeout.

She glanced at the suitcase in the passenger seat and scoffed. "And you still went to see her?"

That woman was his first love.

What man could resist?

"She brought a child with her—"

"What?" Jenna's heart lurched. "Don't tell me it's yours."

"It's not. She had the baby overseas with someone else. The guy abandoned her. The kid's four now, and she wants to enroll him in preschool here. She asked for my help." His voice turned firm. "Besides, the past doesn't matter anymore. You're the only one I love."

Jenna exhaled in relief.

"Next time, I'm coming with you."

"Deal."

After hanging up, she grabbed her luggage and stepped out of the car.

That bastard made her pack up for nothing.

Thank God Ethan wasn't home.

If he'd seen her fleeing like some jilted wife...

Just the thought made her cringe.
###Chapter 467

Autumn deepened, bringing a biting chill. Daytime temperatures barely clung to the mid-50s Fahrenheit, plunging into the 40s after dark.

Jenna Roland had safely passed the critical first trimester of her pregnancy. Now entering the second trimester, her energy levels had noticeably improved.

Morning sunlight filtered through the bedroom curtains. After breakfast prepared by their nutritionist Nanny Dorothy, Jenna headed to the hospital with Ethan Roscente for her prenatal checkup.

At the hospital, tests proceeded smoothly. The doctor reviewed the results with a pleased smile. "The fetus is developing well. All indicators are healthy."

Relief washed over the couple. Their shared glance held quiet joy.

Ethan opened the car door for her afterward. "Any lunch preferences?"

"Hot pot!" Jenna's eyes sparkled with instant enthusiasm.

Ethan sighed. This marked at least the twentieth time she'd requested it in three months.

"Fine. But only clear broth."

"Clear broth is boring. I want spicy." Her lower lip jutted out in protest. Just imagining the bubbling red broth made her mouth water.

Their nutritionist had banned even mildly spicy foods during her pregnancy. Though Jenna had lost ten pounds, their baby thrived.

"Spice isn't good for the baby." Ethan remained firm.

"Just a little spice? Please, darling?" She tugged his sleeve, her voice melting into sweetness.

That single endearment shattered his resolve. "Alright. Hot pot it is."

"Yes!" Jenna hugged his arm, nuzzling against him like an affectionate kitten.

Ethan ruffled her hair indulgently. "Which restaurant?"

She named her favorite spot. Ethan directed their driver immediately. At 11:30 AM, they secured the last available table in the packed establishment.

Ordering, Jenna specified: "Split pot—mild on the spicy side." She selected numerous dishes before pausing. "Should we invite Stella? She lives nearby."

Remembering Stella Laurent's recent care for Jenna, Ethan agreed readily.

Stella accepted the invitation instantly upon hearing "hot pot." As the broth reached a boil and dishes arrived, Jenna eagerly slid the first slices of premium beef into the pot.
###Chapter 468

Jenna Roland had just taken her seat when Stella Laurent nudged the dipping sauce bowl toward her.

"Make your own," Stella winked. "Pregnant women shouldn't stand too long."

Jenna chuckled and stood up, returning moments later with a bowl of vibrant red sauce. She glanced at Ethan Roscente's tense profile and teased, "Did the sun rise from the west today? The mighty CEO actually allowed hotpot?"

Jenna swirled a slice of tripe in the boiling broth. "I begged him for three days. The doctor said the second trimester is stable now, so he finally caved."

"Spicy food is good for circulation during pregnancy," Stella remarked, turning to Ethan.

"Capsaicin irritates the stomach," Ethan countered, pausing his chopsticks over the mild broth.

"You're overreacting." Stella shook her head. "She used to drink hotpot broth like soup."

Seizing the moment, Jenna tugged Ethan's sleeve with doe-eyed innocence.

He sighed and pulled out his phone. "I'll ask Nanny Dorothy to make poached fish tomorrow."

"You're the best!" Jenna cheered, planting a kiss on his cheek.

Ethan's ears turned pink as he placed a lotus root slice in her bowl.

Midway through the meal, Ethan's phone rang. He answered calmly, "Yes, Mother. We're having French... The checkup went perfectly..."

After hanging up, he resumed blanching duck intestines for Jenna, his own bowl of rice untouched.

"Are the grapes at the orchard ripe yet?" Stella asked suddenly.

Jenna's eyes lit up before darting hesitantly toward Ethan.

"Go ahead." He wiped his hands. "Wear something warm."

Thirty minutes later, the black sedan parked at the mountain's base. Stella supported Jenna's slow ascent while Ethan followed two steps behind, ready to steady her.

Sylvia Savigny bustled beneath the grapevines, immediately plucking two clusters of midnight-purple fruit.

"Try these—picked fresh this morning."

Jenna bit into a plump grape, its sweetness bursting across her tongue. She gestured toward workers in the distance. "Are those for shipping?"

"No need." Sylvia wiped her brow. "The buyers are coming to collect them this afternoon."
###Chapter 469

Jenna Roland tossed the last grape seed into the trash. She turned to Sylvia Savigny, who was organizing the orchard accounts. "You're managing this place all by yourself. Don't overwork—take breaks when you need to."

Sylvia closed the ledger with a faint smile. "You're paying me double the market rate. I'd be ungrateful not to work hard."

"Money isn't the issue." Jenna waved a hand, then lowered her voice. "Has Victor Roland's crew been causing trouble lately?"

"Not since the bodyguards beat them up last time. It's been over a month." Sylvia pointed at the two guard dogs chained by the orchard gate. "Now they won't even come near the entrance."

Jenna nodded. "I'm going for a walk in the orchard."

After being cooped up at home for too long, she craved fresh air. Stella Laurent immediately followed as they strolled along the path between fruit trees.

Two hours later, Stella supported Jenna on their way down the hill. Without a car, Stella pulled out her phone to call a rideshare.

Just then, a black Audi screeched to a halt in front of them. Jenna's hand shot into her bag, gripping the pepper spray.

The door opened. A woman in a beige trench coat stepped out, her curls bouncing. Seeing no one else in the car, Jenna relaxed slightly—until she recognized the face.

Yvonne Sherwood.

The woman from the photos and videos Vanessa Galatea had sent.

Jenna withdrew her hand, lips curling into a cold smile. "What an unexpected visit, Ms. Sherwood."

Yvonne adjusted her collar gracefully and extended her right hand. "We haven't met. I'm Yvonne Sherwood."

"Unnecessary." Jenna crossed her arms. "Ethan Roscente already introduced you."

Yvonne's hand hovered awkwardly before she turned to Stella. "And this is?"

"My best friend." Jenna's brow furrowed impatiently. "Get to the point."
###Chapter 470

"Ms. Roland, you're quite straightforward." Yvonne Sherwood dropped her fake smile and pulled up a photo from her phone album. "Do you recognize this child?"

The picture showed a four-year-old boy.

With delicate features, thick eyebrows, big eyes, and fair skin, the boy's smile bore an uncanny resemblance to Ethan Roscente.

Jenna's heart lurched. Her brows furrowed. "Ms. Sherwood, what exactly are you trying to say?"

"This is my son, Oliver Sherwood." Yvonne stroked the screen tenderly. "Given his surname, I shouldn't need to spell it out for you."

Stella Laurent scoffed first. "You're claiming some random kid is Ethan's? How pathetic."

She raised a mocking brow. "Ethan loves Jenna. As his ex, you should know your place and stay away."

Yvonne remained unruffled. "If Grandpa Harrison hadn't interfered back then, Oliver would've been old enough to run errands by now. Ms. Roland, no matter how much it stings, you can't change the fact that Oliver is Ethan's flesh and blood."

"When did you leave the country?" Jenna suddenly asked.

"Four years ago." Yvonne smiled. "Oliver is four now. The timeline matches perfectly."

Jenna clenched her fists. Ethan had mentioned Yvonne had a four-year-old son. If this was true...

"Bring the child for a paternity test another day." Jenna met her gaze squarely. "If he's really Ethan's, I won't stand in your way."

Yvonne calmly produced a DNA report. "It's already been done. See for yourself."

Jenna didn't even glance at it. "I want to witness the sample collection myself. Otherwise..." Her lips curled coldly. "How do I know this report isn't fabricated?"

After their last misunderstanding, she wouldn't take anyone's word at face value again.

"Why not go straight to Ethan?" Jenna took a step forward. "Coming to me specifically... Could it be this child isn't his at all?"

Yvonne's expression faltered. "I just hoped you'd step aside voluntarily and let Oliver return to his real father."

Jenna burst into laughter. "If he's really Ethan's son, what's stopping me from raising him myself?"

"You—!" Yvonne's elegant facade finally cracked.

"Hit a nerve?" Jenna arched a brow mockingly. "Don't tell me I was right. Is this child actually someone else's?"
###Chapter 471

Jenna's words pierced Yvonne's heart like a sharp blade.

Yvonne's pupils constricted abruptly. Her fingers tightened around her purse strap unconsciously.

She never expected this seemingly fragile woman to be so formidable.

"Miss Roland, blood ties can't be severed." Yvonne suppressed her fury. "Would you really deprive a child of his father?"

Jenna curled her lips in disdain, her gaze icy.

"That trick won't work on me." She adjusted her cuffs leisurely. "Even if the child is Ethan's, I wouldn't mind raising one more."

Yvonne's face turned deathly pale.

"How much money do you want to leave him?" she spat through gritted teeth.

Jenna suddenly laughed—a clear, chilling sound.

"The position of Mrs. Roscente isn't for sale." She tilted her head. "Couldn't make it abroad, so you came crawling back to your sugar daddy?"

Yvonne's nails dug into her palms.

"What Ethan and I have is beyond your gold-digging comprehension!"

"Love?" Jenna arched an eyebrow. "The kind where you bring a bastard home to claim paternity?"

Stella interjected pointedly, "Since when do mistresses have the audacity to play the victim?"

Yvonne's chest heaved violently. Even her flawless makeup couldn't mask her contorted expression.

"This isn't over!" Her stilettos struck the ground sharply as she turned away.

Watching the departing car, Jenna's smile faded gradually.

"What a vile woman," Stella fumed.

Jenna remained silent, her gaze distant.

She knew this battle had only just begun.

Inside the car, Jenna stared blankly at her phone.

"Going to call him?" Stella asked softly.

Jenna took a deep breath and dialed Ethan's number.

"Yvonne came to see me." Her voice was eerily calm. "She claims the child is yours."

The line went dead silent.

That silence made Jenna's heart sink inch by inch.

"Did you and her..." Her voice trembled slightly. "Did you ever..."

Ethan's breathing echoed distinctly through the receiver.

"Wait for me." Those three words were all he said.

Jenna hung up and looked out at the blurring scenery.

The sunlight still shone brightly, yet her world had suddenly darkened.
###Chapter 472

"Never." Ethan's denial was absolute. "She was my first girlfriend, but I never laid a finger on her."

"My God, seriously?" Jenna's eyes widened.

She never imagined Ethan and Yvonne had remained chaste during their relationship.

"Every word is true."

"How shameless of her." Jenna scoffed. "Using someone else's child to threaten me into divorce? Ethan, were you blind back then?"

She didn't hold back her frustration in front of him.

Ethan remained composed. His heart belonged only to Jenna now—not to his first love, nor even to an ex-wife.

"I don't understand why she'd do this."

"Isn't it obvious?" Jenna rolled her eyes. "She wants to break us up so she can have you."

"No matter her motives, I won't waver. You'll always be my only wife."

The words warmed Jenna's heart.

She blinked playfully. "Better keep your word, or I'll post about you online and let the internet drag you."

Ethan chuckled. "Silly, I'm about to be a father. Why would I lie?"

"Nonsense. The baby's still in my belly."

"Six more months, and they'll be here. Same difference."

"Humph! If she bothers you again and you dare hesitate, I'll make our child call someone else 'Daddy'!"

"You wouldn't dare!" Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

"Try me if you betray me!"

He massaged his temples. Why was she always so insecure?

But he understood. Orphaned young and mistreated by her uncle's family, Jenna's guardedness was inevitable.

"I swear I'll never hurt you."

"Got it. Just teasing. Get back to work." Jenna hung up abruptly.

Ethan's gaze turned glacial. He pulled up a blocked number and dialed.

When the call connected, his voice was arctic. "Yvonne Sherwood, whoever you are—harass Jenna again, and I won't care about our past."

"I never contacted Jenna! Ethan, you've got it wrong!" A wounded voice protested.

His eyes hardened further. "Yvonne, you're passing off another man's child as mine. Did I ever so much as touch you?"
###Chapter 473

"Ethan, I swear I never took Oliver to see Jenna." Yvonne's grip on the phone turned her knuckles white. "Oliver isn't your child. Jenna is lying! After all these years, don't you know what kind of person I am?"

Ethan's laugh was cold, his chiseled features sharp with disdain. "Who should I believe? My wife, or an outsider?" His voice dropped lower. "If I catch you harassing Jenna again, don't expect mercy."

The call ended. Yvonne's hands trembled. Kyle took one look at her pale face and knew the outcome.

"He guards Jenna like she's his most precious treasure now." Yvonne tossed the phone onto the coffee table, her eyes icy. "If I approach her again, he'll destroy me."

Kyle lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply. "You need Ethan." He exhaled smoke. "Only he can cover your father's debt."

Yvonne knew. Her carefully laid trap had been meant for Ethan. But she hadn't anticipated his swift betrayal—or Jenna's interference. Now Ethan avoided her like the plague. That door was closed.

Her father's loan had ballooned from sixty million to over two hundred million. The lenders gave her six months. After that, they'd come for her and her son.

She could endure anything—but not harm to her child.

Yvonne snatched Kyle's cigarette and took two sharp drags. "It's over. Ethan won't trust me again."

"Then make him." Kyle crushed the cigarette. "No one else has that kind of money."

"Where's Dad?"

"Took Oliver to the amusement park." She rubbed her temples in frustration.

Kyle leaned in. "There is another way." When she looked up, he waved dismissively. "Never mind. You'd never agree."

"Tell me!" She seized his wrist. "As long as it's legal, I'll try anything."

"I know a club manager. Her girls make six figures monthly—"

"Kyle!" Yvonne hurled a cushion at him. "You want me to sell myself? Are you human?"

He blocked it. "See? I knew you'd refuse."

"Pathetic! You'd push me into hell just to save yourself!" Her entire body shook with rage.

Oliver's real name was Oliver Cortez—her son with Kyle from their time abroad. Back then, Kyle had been a charming executive pursuing her. She'd thought it was love. Now look where they were.
###Chapter 474 

Yvonne Sherwood discovered her pregnancy less than two months into her relationship with Kyle Cortez. Without hesitation, Kyle whisked her abroad for a romantic wedding ceremony, though they couldn't legally register their marriage due to residency issues.

When their son Oliver turned two, Kyle's company suddenly went bankrupt. He sent out countless resumes but faced constant rejection, forcing the family to live off their dwindling savings. To make matters worse, Yvonne's father Oscar developed a gambling addiction and squandered Kyle's remaining savings within a year.

Kyle eventually borrowed money to start a new business. After scraping together enough for plane tickets, he moved the family back to Los Angeles. His parents had passed away five years prior, leaving them an old house and a modest inheritance. But instead of rebuilding their lives, Kyle sank into depression and idleness.

Oscar's gambling spiraled out of control just as Oliver started preschool, burying the family under crushing debt. Desperate, Yvonne set her sights on Ethan Roscente. Becoming Mrs. Roscente would erase not just their $200 million debt—even a billion would be trivial.

Her carefully laid plans collapsed spectacularly. Asking Ethan for help now would be suicidal. With the Roscente family's influence, the slightest retaliation could destroy them completely.

"What other options do we have?" Kyle exhaled a smoke ring. "If some rich woman wanted me, I'd sell myself in a heartbeat. Too bad nobody's interested."

Though Yvonne had given birth, her figure had become even more alluring than in her youth. Her porcelain skin and voluptuous curves radiated mature sensuality. At an upscale club, she could earn a fortune.

Slap! Yvonne's palm cracked against his thigh before she stormed out, slamming the door behind her.

Kyle lit another cigarette, unfazed. The inheritance money was nearly gone. If Yvonne failed to seduce Ethan, she'd have to find work immediately—or they'd all starve.

He dialed an old friend. "How'd you convince your girlfriend to work at the club? I barely mentioned it and Yvonne lost it."

"We broke up. She went to the club on her own, gave me spending money too. Pity..." The voice on the line sighed.

"Damn. I've got loan sharks breathing down my neck. If she won't do it, how am I supposed to pay?"

"Club money comes fast, but you can't force her."

After hanging up, Kyle stubbed out his cigarette and stepped onto the balcony to call his father-in-law.

In the bedroom, Yvonne scrolled through job listings when her father Oscar's call flashed across her screen.
###Chapter 475

The phone rang shrilly.

Yvonne Sherwood pressed the answer button. Oscar Sherwood's voice came through the receiver.

"Yvonne, I'm out of options..."

Her fingers tightened instantly, nails digging deep into her palms.

"Dad, you want me to work as an escort?" Her voice trembled. "I'm your own daughter!"

Tears welled up in her eyes but stubbornly refused to fall.

Kyle Cortez's humiliation still echoed in her ears. Now even her own father would do this to her.

"I know I've failed you..." Oscar's voice cracked with tears. "But those men said if we don't repay the debt in six months, they'll kill me and Oliver..."

"I might as well die!" he suddenly screamed hysterically.

Yvonne closed her eyes.

The same old act.

But what could she do? Her mother was gone. He was her only family left.

"Enough!"

She took a deep breath. "I'll figure out the money."

Hanging up, she stood before the floor-to-ceiling window.

Outside, the city glittered with skyscrapers and neon lights.

Twenty million.

The number crushed her lungs.

The club...

She bit her lip hard enough to draw blood.

It was the last place she'd ever stoop to.

But what other choice did she have?

Three months later.

The maternity hospital bustled with activity.

Ethan Roscente carefully supported Jenna Roland as they exited the examination room.

"Take it slow." His hand remained protectively at the small of her back.

Jenna's baby bump had become noticeably prominent.

"What's today's date?" she suddenly asked.

Ethan blinked.

"April twenty-first." She grinned. "My birthday."

He frowned in dismay. "I'm sorry, I—"

"Silly." Jenna playfully punched his arm. "I want hotpot."

Ethan chuckled. "So that's your game?"

"Pregnant women get what they want!" she declared imperiously.

He affectionately pinched her cheek. "Alright, let's go."

The driver turned the car toward their usual hotpot restaurant.
###Chapter 476

The hot pot restaurant was filled with steam. A server led them to their table. After ordering, Ethan Roscente excused himself to make a phone call outside.

Jenna Roland stared blankly at the bubbling broth. Ten minutes passed before Ethan finally returned.

"Who were you talking to for so long?" she couldn't help asking.

Ethan sat beside her and pressed a light kiss to her cheek. "Let's go to the club tonight. I reserved a private room."

"Which one?"

"The one where you used to work." A faint smirk played on his lips. "Tristan Ashcroft said it's on the house. Drinks are unlimited."

Jenna arched an eyebrow. "Since when is he so generous?"

"He needs a favor." Ethan dropped a slice of fatty beef into the pot. "Invite your friends too."

Jenna pulled out her phone, first messaging Stella Laurent, then asking her to bring her sister. After a moment's thought, she contacted two other close friends.

After the meal, Ethan had their driver take them straight back to Beverly Hills.

Waking from her nap, Jenna stood before the closet in frustration. At six months pregnant, none of her clothes fit anymore.

"We'll buy new ones." Ethan appeared behind her and took her hand.

"Don't you have work?" Jenna asked guiltily.

"It's your birthday." He squeezed her fingers. "Work isn't as important as my wife."

Jenna burst out laughing. "Is CEO Roscente turning into a romantic?"

"Only for you." Ethan suddenly stopped walking. "Let me kiss you."

Jenna glanced around nervously. "There are so many people—"

Before she could finish, Ethan's lips brushed her cheek. Her ears burned as she lowered her head and hurried ahead.

This man was becoming more brazen by the day.
###Chapter 477

The second floor of the mall glittered with dazzling lights. Jenna Roland held Ethan Roscente's arm, her gaze drawn to a display window of a women's boutique.

"That dress is stunning." Her eyes lit up as she tugged Ethan toward the store.

His phone suddenly rang.

"Go ahead and browse. I need to take this." He glanced at the caller ID—Lucas Roscente, his assistant.

Jenna nodded and entered the shop alone.

She headed straight for the teal-blue gown, fingertips brushing lightly over the fabric. The luxurious texture made her eyes widen—this was premium material.

"Madam, our pieces start at fifty thousand." A saleswoman approached in stilettos, her disdainful gaze sweeping over Jenna's modest outfit. "If you can't afford it, I suggest you don't touch."

Jenna jerked her hand back. "That expensive?"

The saleswoman crossed her arms with a sneer. "You walked in without even recognizing our brand?"

Jenna's face flushed crimson. She hadn't noticed the label—she'd simply admired the dress.

"My apologies." She turned to leave.

"Trash like you shouldn't embarrass yourself in luxury stores." The saleswoman's voice followed her. "Can't even buy a single piece, yet you pretend to shop here?"

Jenna whirled around, knuckles whitening. "What did you say?"

The woman lifted her chin. "Am I wrong? Your entire outfit costs less than one of our scarves."

Whispers broke out among nearby shoppers.

Jenna took a deep breath, then raised her voice. "Everyone, hear this! This salesperson claims poor people don't deserve to shop!"

A crowd quickly gathered.

The store manager rushed over. "Madam, is there a problem?"

Jenna pointed at the saleswoman. "Does your brand offer seven-day returns?"

"Of course." The manager forced a smile.

"Perfect." Jenna walked to the clothing rack, tapping various pieces. "This one, this one, and that... I'll take them all."

Gasps erupted.

"She's insane! That's hundreds of thousands!"

The saleswoman paled. "You're serious?"

Jenna pulled out her phone and dialed Ethan. "Honey, I'm at Dior. Come settle the bill."
###Chapter 478

"Picking so many clothes? How embarrassing when you can't afford them!"

The snarky saleswoman hurried behind Jenna Roland and hissed at the younger associate, "Are you stupid? Can't you see she's just some broke nobody? If these clothes get wrinkled, you think you can pay for them?"

The young salesgirl hesitated, glancing uncertainly at Jenna.

"Checkout." Jenna's voice was ice.

Reluctantly, the associate gathered the armful of designer pieces and headed to the register.

Whispers rippled through the gathered crowd. "That's at least eight hundred grand worth."
"Some are limited edition—I saw one piece in Vogue priced at over a hundred thousand."
"Think she can actually pay?"
"Let's watch the show."

The cashier finished tallying. "Your total comes to two point three five million."

The boutique fell dead silent. Every eye locked onto Jenna.

The rude saleswoman sneered. "Stop pretending! No money? I'm calling security!"

Without even lifting her gaze, Jenna slid a black titanium card across the counter. "Run this."

Beep. Payment approved.

The cashier's eyes widened. The nasty saleswoman's face drained of color.

"She...she must've blown her life savings!" the woman spat, forcing a laugh. "Pathetic!"

Jenna casually added two handbags and two pairs of shoes. "Ring these too."

"Seven hundred thousand," announced the cashier.

Another successful swipe.

Jenna turned slowly to face her tormentor. "I don't need to prove anything to you." Her words were daggers. "But remember this—" She enunciated each syllable. "Judgmental. Bitch."

The saleswoman trembled with rage.

Then Jenna gave the cashier an apologetic smile. "Actually, these don't suit my style. I'd like to return everything."

The silence was deafening.

Just then, Ethan Roscente strode in, his long legs eating up the distance. He draped an arm around Jenna's shoulders. "Done shopping, darling? Let me get that."

He produced a matte black card edged with subtle gold filigree—one of only three in existence.

Gasps erupted. "That's...Ethan Roscente from HM Group?"
"Oh my God! It's really him!"
"They say there are only two of those cards in the entire country..."
"He called her darling?"

Every expression in the room transformed. The nasty saleswoman turned ghostly pale, her knees buckling.
###Chapter 479

The sneer froze on sales associate Lana Chen's face.

The globally exclusive black card gleamed coldly under the boutique lights.

The cashier's hands trembled slightly. "You... You're Mr. Roscente from HM Group?"

Ethan Roscente's icy gaze swept across the room. His thin lips parted. "Yes."

The entire boutique fell dead silent.

Lana's legs gave out. She collapsed to her knees with a thud.

The gravity of her mistake finally dawned on her.

"Mrs. Roscente..." Lana's voice shook. "I was blind—"

Jenna Roland looked down at her, crimson lips curving. "Is this how luxury sales associates behave?"

Lana pressed her forehead to the floor. "Please have mercy..."

Ethan's eyes turned glacial.

He dialed the mall's general manager.

Three minutes later, Manager Chen arrived, sweating profusely.

"Mr. Roscente!" He bowed deeply. "Who dared offend you?"

Lana scrambled toward him, sobbing. "Manager Chen, help me!"

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed through the boutique.

Lana clutched her cheek, stunned.

"Idiot!" Manager Chen roared. "You didn't recognize Mr. Roscente? Are you blind?"

His dress shirt was soaked through with sweat.

This mall was just a minor asset under HM Group's vast empire.

Only then did Lana recall the imposing man who'd been standing by the entrance earlier.

But she'd been too busy mocking the "penniless woman."

"Mrs. Roscente..." Lana crawled to Jenna's feet. "My son is only five. This job supports my whole family..."

Ethan turned to his wife, gaze softening. "Your call."

Jenna's voice was arctic. "Name?"

"L-Lana Chen..."

"Remember this." Jenna enunciated each word. "I want you to beg on your knees."
###Chapter 480

Lena Chen kept her head bowed, voice trembling. "Mrs. Roscente, I sincerely apologize. Please give me another chance."

Jenna Roland ignored her plea and turned to the cashier. "Wrap these clothes and deliver them to my home."

Growing up modestly had instilled frugal habits in her. Even now with club dividends, orchard profits, and the Roscente family's wealth at her disposal, she remained prudent with spending. She could easily buy the entire mall if she wished.

"Right away, Mrs. Roscente." The cashier noted the address respectfully.

Jenna linked arms with Ethan. "Let's go, darling."

Ethan's icy gaze swept over Lena. "You're spared this time for my wife's sake. If it happens again—" His eyes scanned the staff. "Do I make myself clear?"

"Absolutely, Mr. Roscente! This won't recur!" The employees chorused.

Outside the boutique, Jenna bit her lip. "Do I really look... unfashionable?"

Ethan's gaze softened. "Nonsense. You elevate the clothes, not the other way around."

"Flatterer." She chuckled.

"Truth." He pulled her closer. "Those women only disagree because they envy you."

Jenna arched a brow. "Or is it love blinding your judgment?"

Suddenly, Ethan stopped a passing young man. "Don't you think she's beautiful?"

Jenna's cheeks burned crimson.

The boy appraised her and nodded honestly. "Very."

"Thank you." Satisfied, Ethan led Jenna away. "See? Objective proof of your beauty."

"You're impossible..." Her ears tingled pink.

"Let's pick out jewelry." He suggested.

"Unnecessary." She shook her head. "I've no occasions to wear them."

After a pause, Ethan countered, "Then wedding bands."

This time, Jenna didn't refuse.

At the jewelry counter, Ethan selected platinum diamond rings. He had Jenna slide the groom's band onto his finger first, then solemnly slipped the bride's ring onto her work-roughened hand.

Diamonds glittered under the lights, accentuating her calloused fingers from years of labor. Yet to Ethan, those hands outshone any jewel.
###Chapter 481

Twilight faded as city lights flickered to life.

Jenna Roland walked arm-in-arm with Ethan Roscente as they exited the restaurant. Their assistant Lucas had already parked the Maybach by the curb. The sleek black car glided toward Studio 54, neon reflections dancing across Jenna's eyes through the tinted windows.

"We're here," Lucas announced, cutting the engine.

Jenna's phone rang the moment she stepped onto the pavement. Stella Laurent's name flashed on the screen.

"Hello?"

"Where are you guys?" Stella's voice bubbled with excitement.

"Just arrived at the club," Jenna chuckled. "Hurry up."

Ethan appeared beside her before she could pocket her phone. His arm slid around her waist, fingers splaying protectively over her rounded belly.

The club lobby glittered with gilded opulence. Tristan Ashcroft stood behind the bar mixing drinks, his back turned until Jenna's voice made him pivot.

"Mrs. Roscente?" His gaze dropped to her stomach, pupils contracting. "This is..."

"Six months," Ethan stated coldly.

Tristan's Adam's apple bobbed. "Congratulations."

"Is our room ready?" Ethan's clipped tone severed the awkward moment. His grip tightened as he noticed lingering stares from nearby patrons.

"VIP 888." Tristan gestured toward the elevators. "This way."

Jenna felt Ethan's muscles tense during the ascent. She gave his palm a reassuring squeeze.

Once the private room's door closed, Tristan cleared his throat. "How many in your party?"

"Seven," Jenna said.

"Ten," Ethan corrected. "Sophie and her boyfriend are coming. Plus Gavin."

Tristan nodded and withdrew. Outside, he leaned against the corridor wall and lit a cigarette. Smoke curled around him as he studied his elongated shadow on the marble floor.

"Boss?" Chloe Blanchet approached with a drinks menu. "You look pale."

"Fine." He stubbed out the cigarette and walked away.

Inside the suite, Jenna's phone illuminated with Chloe's text: «You here?»

«VIP 888,» she typed back.

The door burst open to Chloe's ear-splitting shriek.

"Oh my God!" She zeroed in on Jenna's bump. "When did you—"

"Six months." Jenna smiled, interlacing her fingers with Ethan's.

Chloe's eyes darted between them before welling up. "This is..." She pulled Jenna into a fierce hug. "Finally, someone's taking proper care of you."

Ethan's phone buzzed. He frowned at the caller ID. "I need to take this."

The door had barely shut when Chloe whispered, "So... the cruise?"

Jenna's ears burned as she nodded.

"I knew it!" Chloe slapped the velvet couch. "The way he looked at you that night—"

The door swung open again. Stella entered arm-in-arm with her boyfriend, followed by Sophie Roscente and Gavin Valentine.

"Surprise!" Stella threw her arms wide. "Happy birthday, mama-to-be!"
###Chapter 482

Jenna Roland lounged lazily on the leather sofa, her fingertips lightly tracing the rim of her crystal glass.

"Jealous?" She chuckled softly. "There's nothing to envy."

Chloe Blanchet pursed her lips, tucking the serving tray against her hip. "How could I not be? We started at the club together, and now you're a wealthy socialite while I'm still selling drinks."

Jenna took a sip of her juice. "I never stopped working after marriage." She glanced at Chloe. "This industry has an expiration date. You should consider a career change."

"Easier said than done." Chloe sighed. "The money's good here. No other job pays this well."

"How much have you saved?" Jenna asked bluntly.

Chloe held up fingers to indicate the amount. "Over a million and a half."

"Enough to open a small shop," Jenna suggested seriously.

Chloe waved her off, then suddenly remembered. "Did you order drinks? I'll go get them."

"The boss is treating today." Jenna winked.

Chloe was about to reply when her phone buzzed. She checked the caller ID—Patrick Klein, the manager.

"Gotta go." She stood hastily. "I'll catch up with you later."

Jenna watched her leave before turning to Ethan Roscente beside her. The man was engrossed in his phone, his long fingers flying across the keyboard.

"Still working?" She leaned closer.

Ethan immediately locked the screen and set the phone aside. "Just keeping you company."

Jenna looped her arm through his, eyes sparkling. "Why is the boss treating us? This place isn't cheap."

"He's treating me." Ethan pinched her nose playfully. "You're stuck with juice."

Jenna pouted.

Amusement flickered in Ethan's eyes. "I handed him a project that earned him hundreds of millions."

"What kind of project was that profitable?" Jenna's eyes widened.

"Real estate." His tone was casual. "He wants to stay connected for future opportunities."

Jenna whistled softly. "That's insane money." She muttered under her breath, "Maybe I should've gone into real estate."

The private room door swung open. Tristan Ashcroft entered with two servers—and an unexpected third person.

Jenna's smile froze.

Yvonne Sherwood's hands trembled, nearly spilling the red wine. Her face drained of color, clearly unprepared for this encounter.

"You know each other?" Tristan instantly sensed the tension.

Jenna gave a cold laugh. "This is Mr. Roscente's ex-girlfriend."

Tristan inhaled sharply, his gaze darting between the three.

Yvonne set down the wine bottle and turned to leave.

"Wait." Jenna's voice stopped her. "Last time you claimed Oliver was Ethan's son. Care to repeat that in front of everyone?"

The air in the room turned to ice.
###Chapter 483

Tristan Ashcroft's gaze flickered between Yvonne Sherwood and the Roscente couple. Tonight's drama was proving more entertaining than he'd anticipated.

If that child Oliver truly was Ethan Roscente's flesh and blood, Jenna Roland would surely file for divorce.

What woman could tolerate her husband's illegitimate child?

If that happened, wouldn't he...

Yvonne stole a glance at Ethan's stormy expression before turning to Jenna with trembling lips. "I made a mistake. Ethan isn't Oliver's father."

Jenna approached slowly, her pregnant belly prominent. Yvonne's pupils constricted at the sight.

No wonder Ethan had been so ruthless—Jenna already carried his heir.

"Running low on funds lately, Ms. Sherwood?" Jenna crossed her arms, a mocking smile playing on her lips.

Yvonne clenched her skirt. "Must you humiliate me?"

"Then why claim Oliver was Ethan's son?" Jenna's smile deepened. "Coming to beg me to leave him—wasn't it all about his money?"

Yvonne's panicked eyes darted to Ethan.

The glacial aura radiating from the man made her blood run cold.

"I was wrong!" Her nails dug into her palms. "Please show mercy..."

"Who is Oliver's real father?" Jenna stepped closer abruptly.

"It's... Kyle Cortez's." Yvonne nearly ground her teeth to dust.

Jenna burst into laughter. "Using another man's child to threaten the lawful wife? Quite the spectacle, Ms. Sherwood."

Tears spilled as Yvonne failed to comprehend how the man who'd once doted on her now watched coldly as she was shamed.

"Leave." The single word sliced from Ethan's lips.

As Yvonne stumbled toward the exit, the private room door swung open. Stella Laurent and her sister Bridget Valois entered with other socialites, followed by Gavin Valentine and Sophie Roscente with her boyfriend Zane Aldridge.

The quiet space instantly buzzed with activity.

Tristan eagerly poured drinks and arranged dishes, probing, "Care to sing for us, Mr. Roscente?"

Everyone knew Ethan never participated in such entertainment, preferring to drink in silence.

Sipping juice while cradling her belly, Jenna nodded at the lavish spread. "Your generosity is appreciated, Tristan."
###Chapter 484

Tristan Ashcroft's gaze lingered on Jenna Roland, a gentle smile curving his lips.

"You've made me a fortune these past years at the club." He swirled his wineglass. "It's your birthday today, and Ethan just landed us a major project. Tonight's drinks are on me."

Jenna bit her lower lip, fingers absently tracing the rim of her glass.

"These are too expensive."

Tristan laughed heartily, crow's feet crinkling at his temples.

"Birthdays are for celebrating. Don't overthink it."

Jenna lifted her juice glass, raising it solemnly toward Tristan.

"Thank you, boss."

"No need for formalities." He clinked glasses with her and downed his drink in one go.

The private room buzzed with energy. Stella Laurent and another colleague pulled Jenna into animated conversation while others sang or played drinking games, the atmosphere electric.

When the clock struck nine, Tristan checked his wristwatch. After exchanging a nod with Ethan Roscente, he slipped out unnoticed.

Moments later, the door reopened.

Lights flicked off abruptly, plunging Jenna into darkness.

Ethan's warm palm covered her eyes, his breath tickling her ear.

"Don't be scared. It's a surprise."

Jenna obediently closed her eyes, lashes fluttering against his skin.

The door creaked as a server wheeled in a towering pink cake. The Black Swan logo shimmered in candlelight, the air thickening with rose fragrance.

"Happy birthday to you—"

As the singing began, Ethan withdrew his hand.

Jenna blinked open tear-brightened eyes. She pressed a hand to her mouth, overwhelmed by the fairytale scene.

"Ethan..."

She turned and buried her face in his chest, voice trembling.

"No thanks needed between us." He stroked her back. "Make a wish."

Jenna clasped her hands, candlelight gilding her devout profile.

The flames vanished with her exhale. Ethan captured her hand.

"Let's cut it together."

The cake knife descended, releasing waves of sugary sweetness. Each guest received a meticulously plated slice.

"Enjoy yourselves tonight—drinks and desserts are my treat." Jenna raised her glass in salute.

Stella winked mischievously. "May our birthday girl stay forever this gorgeous!"

"Forever eighteen!" her friend chimed in.

Jenna laughed, settling back on the sofa. She scooped up cake and offered it to Ethan.

"Try some?"

He shook his head, swiping frosting onto her nose instead.

"Happy birthday, darling."

Jenna curled against her husband's shoulder like a contented cat. The cake's sweetness melted on her tongue, the happiness so intense it verged on dizzying.
###Chapter 485

The clock struck half past eleven when Jenna Roland and Ethan Roscente returned home under the deep night sky.

Jenna's eyelids grew heavy with exhaustion. She took a quick hot shower before slipping beneath the covers.

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains the next day. Jenna blinked awake to find Ethan engrossed in replying to messages on his phone.

"Seeing Yvonne Sherwood at the club last night must've been hard for you," she said abruptly.

Yvonne was Ethan's ex. They'd dated for years. If not for Grandpa Harrison's interference, they might've had children by now. Jenna doubted Ethan could remain unaffected.

Ethan turned his head with a resigned smile. "What exactly should I be feeling?"

"She's your ex. You even called out her name when you were drunk." Jenna sat up. "Seeing her working at a place like that—doesn't it bother you at all?"

Setting his phone aside, Ethan traced her cheekbone with slender fingers. "The past is the past. I don't dwell on it. My heart belongs only to you now."

"Completely over her?" Jenna's eyes widened in surprise.

"Mhm." His gaze softened. "Since falling for you, no other woman exists to me."

Jenna laughed and looped her arms around his neck, pressing a kiss to his cheek. "Now that's the perfect husband I dreamed of."

"Flattery accepted." Ethan tapped his lips. "This needs attention too."

She leaned in for a quick peck. "Happy now?"

"If you weren't carrying our baby..." He pinched her nose playfully. "You wouldn't escape so easily."

"I read online that the second trimester allows—" Jenna's words were cut off by a light flick to her forehead.

"Don't be reckless!" Ethan frowned. "If anything happens to the baby, Grandpa would skin me alive."

"It's not that serious..."

"You know how important this child is to them." Rubbing his temples, he stood. "Come on, let's get Her Highness ready for the day."

In the bathroom, Ethan meticulously squeezed toothpaste onto her brush and filled a glass with warm water.

"I'm so happy right now," Jenna mumbled around her toothbrush.

"Because you married well." Standing behind her, Ethan gently combed through her long hair.

"You've gained a little weight," he remarked suddenly.

Jenna whipped her head around, mouth foaming as she glared. "Really?"

"Just a bit." He chuckled. "But I like it. You're softer to hold now."

"Liar!" She rinsed her mouth. "Yvonne was so slender—you clearly prefer skinny girls. I'm definitely losing weight after delivery!"

Ethan embraced her from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder. "Why not stay just like this for me?"

"No way!" Breaking free, Jenna marched out without looking back.

Watching her retreating figure, Ethan shook his head with an amused smile and picked up his razor. The man in the mirror still wore an expression of utter fondness.
###Chapter 486

Early summer in Los Angeles brought sweltering heat and the relentless chorus of cicadas.

Jenna Roland sat in the living room, her swollen belly making even the cool breeze from the AC ineffective against the discomfort of her third trimester.

Only seven days remained until her due date.

Ethan Roscente had issued a strict order forbidding her from leaving the house. Not that she had the energy to go anywhere even if he allowed it.

Her feet were puffy like dough, her lower back ached constantly, and the worst part—she had to pee every hour.

"Stella!" Jenna called toward the kitchen.

Stella Laurent hurried out, wiping her hands. "What's wrong?"

"Help me to the bathroom." Jenna tried pushing herself up from the couch.

Stella rushed to support her. "Didn't you just go?"

"The baby's pressing on my bladder." Jenna gave a tired smile. "The doctor said it's normal."

Nights were even worse. She'd barely fall asleep before the urge to pee woke her up, forcing Ethan to help her every time. His dark circles had deepened noticeably.

"Just one more week," Stella reassured her.

Back on the couch, Jenna exhaled heavily.

"Ethan hasn't been sleeping well," she murmured, rubbing her belly.

"I could stay with you at night," Stella offered. "That way he can rest."

Jenna shook her head. "We'd have to ask him first. You know how he is..."

"I'll cut some watermelon while you check with him." Stella tactfully retreated.

Jenna texted Ethan. Her phone rang immediately.

"Why call?" she answered.

"Didn't want you staring at your phone." His voice sounded exhausted. "Is Stella strong enough to help you?"

"I'm not that heavy!" Jenna huffed. "She helps me all the time."

A pause. "...Fine."

"Get some proper sleep tonight," she said softly.

"Business lunch today. Won't be home."

"Okay. Go easy on the drinks." Hanging up, she gazed blankly at the blazing sunlight outside.

The sweet aroma of watermelon drifted over as Stella returned with a fruit plate. "Did he agree?"

Jenna nodded, spearing a juicy wedge. The cool burst of flavor momentarily eased her discomfort.
###Chapter 487

Stella walked out of the kitchen carrying a plate of freshly cut watermelon. Crystal-clear droplets slid down the glistening fruit.

She placed the tray on the coffee table and speared a piece with a silver fork, handing it to Jenna.

"Did your husband agree?"

"He said yes." Jenna took the watermelon. "You can stay in my brother's room tonight. He and Ryan will stay at a hotel for a few days."

"Perfect." Stella's eyes curved into crescents.

Three days later, at four in the afternoon, Jenna was lounging on the couch watching TV when a sharp pain gripped her abdomen.

The contractions came in steady waves, rhythmic but not unbearable.

She immediately recognized the signs of labor.

Calmly picking up her phone, Jenna started timing them. The pains came every half hour, lasting less than thirty seconds each.

"Stella, grab my hospital bag," she called toward the bedroom. "I think I'm having contractions."

"What? You're in labor?" Stella rushed out in a panic.

"It's still early. We'll know it's time when they're a few minutes apart." Jenna remained composed. "Just get everything ready first."

Flustered, Stella dragged out the pre-packed hospital bag and set it by the door.

"Should we go to the hospital now? Wait—we need to call Ethan first!"

Jenna nodded and dialed Ethan's number. In the middle of a meeting, Ethan immediately excused himself and bolted from the office.

By the time Ethan arrived home, Jenna was reclining on the couch, counting the intervals between contractions.

He rushed to her side in three quick strides, gripping her hand tightly. His voice trembled slightly. "Is the pain bad?"

"Manageable. The gaps are still long." Jenna spoke softly. "But we should head to the hospital now."

"Can you walk?"

"Carry me."

Without hesitation, Ethan scooped her up in his arms and turned to Stella. "Bring the hospital bag."

Their car waited at the community entrance. Ethan carefully settled Jenna into the backseat, only starting the engine after Stella climbed in.

"How are you feeling now?" He glanced at her through the rearview mirror, concern etched on his face.

"I can handle it." Jenna bit her lip.

Ethan tightened his grip on the steering wheel, torn between driving cautiously and wishing he could teleport to the hospital.

Thirty minutes later, they finally pulled into the hospital parking lot.

Ethan carried Jenna straight to the ninth-floor maternity ward. Nurses sprang into action upon seeing them, arranging an immediate examination.

After a cervical check, the doctor informed them, "Only one centimeter dilated. You've got at least eight or nine hours to go. Try walking around a bit."

For safety, the doctor ordered fetal monitoring, which showed everything was normal.

"A standard room is fine," Jenna said.

"VIP suite." Ethan cut in firmly, leaving no room for argument.

The doctor nodded and filled out the admission forms for the VIP ward.
###Chapter 488

Ethan swiped his card and gently guided Jenna into the VIP maternity ward.

The spacious suite was elegantly furnished, with floor-to-ceiling windows showcasing the city skyline. Fresh flowers adorned the leather sofa, and the mini fridge overflowed with imported fruits.

"This doesn't feel like a hospital," Jenna murmured, running her fingers over the plush bedsheets.

Ethan pulled out his phone. "Mom, Dad, Jenna's in labor. Come now."

Hanging up, Jenna frowned. "The doctor said I'm only one centimeter dilated. It'll be at least eight more hours."

"More hands make light work." He tucked the blanket around her.

A contraction hit. Jenna gripped the sheets. Thirty seconds later, she exhaled sharply, eyes sparkling as she turned to Stella. "I want hotpot with iced cola!"

Stella glanced at Ethan's expression before laughing. "No such treats during postpartum confinement. Enjoy them now."

"Darling?" Jenna tugged Ethan's sleeve.

"Whatever you want." He pinched her nose playfully.

Jenna immediately transferred money to Stella. "Order extra for everyone."

An hour later, the door swung open. Grandpa Harrison entered first with his cane, followed by Grace carrying a thermal container.

"Why weren't we notified sooner?" Grace shot her son a glare.

Ethan rubbed his temples. "We were admitting her."

"How are you feeling, dear?" Grace's voice softened as she sat beside Jenna.

"Contractions are still irregular." Jenna cradled her belly.

Grace turned to Ethan. "Go get your wife proper food!"

"Stella already went."

The older woman took Jenna's hand. "Bite Ethan if it hurts. Don't hold back."

"Mom!"

"Your wife's comfort comes first," Grace retorted.

Grandma Blanche stroked Jenna's hair. "Brave girl."

"It's worth it." Jenna's eyes glistened.

The door opened again as Stella entered with aromatic paper bags. Spicy broth, fried chicken wings, and boba tea covered the coffee table, the scent of chili oil permeating the room.

"Dig in!" Jenna reached eagerly.
###Chapter 489

Stella's snacks covered every inch of the hospital coffee table. Jenna couldn't resist indulging, devouring most of them until her stomach bulged uncomfortably.

She reluctantly set down the last bite, leaving several untouched treats. Stella turned to Blanche and Grace, offering them the leftovers.

All three declined with polite gestures.

Unable to bear wasting food, Stella settled in to finish them herself.

Jenna shifted restlessly, too full to sit or lie down. She paced the room with Ethan hovering protectively beside her—one hand steadying her lower back, the other cradling her swollen belly.

Five grueling hours passed before her cervix dilated to four centimeters.

The epidural brought sweet relief. Jenna resumed her slow walks down the hallway, now only wincing slightly during contractions.

Another eight hours crawled by. Seven centimeters.

Frustration gnawed at Jenna. The doctor had estimated an eight-to-nine-hour labor. Why was this taking so much longer?

"Wasn't the epidural supposed to eliminate the pain?" she gritted out between breaths.

Three excruciating hours later—nine centimeters. Her water broke in a sudden gush, and nurses rushed her to delivery.

Outside, Ethan wore a path in the floor. Blanche and Harrison fidgeted in their seats. Milo, who'd arrived that evening, stood sentry by the doors.

One hour later, a nurse emerged with a swaddled bundle.

"Congratulations, Mr. Roscente. A healthy baby boy."

"Really?" Blanche's voice quivered with emotion.

Harrison's eyes glistened. "Our family line continues!"

Milo pumped his fist. "I'm an uncle!"

Ethan barely glanced at the infant. "How's my wife?"

"Second-degree tearing. The doctor's suturing now. She's exhausted—we'll take her straight to recovery."

Grace pressed a hand to her chest. "How severe is the tear?"

"The baby's head circumference was above average," the nurse explained gently.

Tears spilled down Grace's cheeks.

"We need to run newborn screenings. Which family members will accompany us?"

Grace and Benjamin followed immediately.

Ethan, Stella, Milo and Blanche remained outside.

When Jenna was wheeled out thirty minutes later, she looked ghostly pale—drenched in sweat, too spent to speak.

Ethan cradled her icy hand, his own eyes suspiciously bright. "Rest now, love. You were incredible."

Jenna managed a faint nod before surrendering to oblivion.

After settling her, the nurse reviewed post-delivery instructions and departed.

Blanche produced bottles and formula. "The little one will be hungry soon."

Stella blinked. "No breastfeeding?"

Blanche cast a protective glance at Jenna's unconscious form. "Formula. Let her body heal first."

Watching the Roscentes fuss over their new arrival, Stella felt an unexpected pang. Jenna had everything—a doting husband, devoted in-laws, now a male heir to secure her position.

Her future couldn't be brighter.
###Chapter 490 

Ethan took out the formula and baby bottle from his bag. The bottle had been sterilized at home, and the water in the thermos was at the perfect temperature, ready to prepare the baby's meal.

He turned to look at Jenna on the hospital bed. She was fast asleep, exhausted from the physical toll of childbirth, finally able to rest properly.

Half an hour later, Grace returned to the room with the crying baby and Benjamin. Worried the noise would wake Jenna, Ethan gestured for them to step outside. He quickly prepared the formula and handed the bottle to Grace.

"The little one is starving," Grace murmured soothingly, carefully guiding the nipple to the baby's mouth.

Grandma Blanche leaned in, her eyes filled with tenderness. "Look how eagerly he's drinking. All that crying earlier—he was just hungry."

Benjamin chuckled and asked Grandpa Harrison, "Dad, who do you think he takes after?"

"He looks just like Ethan," Grandpa Harrison observed, studying his grandson. "The shape of his head is identical to Ethan's when he was a baby."

Ethan frowned. "My head was that big?"

Grandma Blanche immediately chimed in, "You were always our big-headed boy."

Skeptical, Ethan turned to Milo. "Be honest."

Milo awkwardly rubbed his nose. "Well... it was kind of large."

What truly left Ethan speechless was when Grace nodded in agreement. "The doctor said Jenna's severe perineal tearing was because the baby's head circumference exceeded the norm. The genetics are undeniable."

Even his own mother had to say it—Ethan was utterly defeated.

The baby soon fell asleep in Grace's arms, but most of the formula remained in the bottle. A nurse came in to check and reminded them, "A newborn's stomach is very small. Thirty milliliters per feeding is enough."

Ethan realized he'd prepared too much. He'd been worried the baby would go hungry, but he might have overburdened him instead.

The nurse moved to Jenna's bedside. "We need to massage the uterus to help expel the lochia."

Stella hesitated. "But she just fell asleep..."

"This is essential postpartum care," the nurse said, pulling back the blanket and applying firm pressure to Jenna's abdomen.

The sudden, sharp pain jolted Jenna awake. The combination of uterine contractions and external pressure made her break out in a cold sweat.

"Why does it still hurt after giving birth?" Jenna asked weakly.

The nurse continued her work as she explained, "The uterus needs to shrink back to its original size. This is normal."

Jenna finally understood—the pain of childbirth wasn't over yet. After the nurse left, she said to Stella, who was staying overnight, "You should get some rest. Grandma and the others can take care of things here."

Stella shook her head. "I'll just nap on the empty bed next door. You're the one who needs proper rest right now."

Grateful, Jenna nodded and closed her eyes again. The room finally settled into quiet, the only sound the steady beeping of the monitor.
###Chapter 491

Morning sunlight streamed through the gap in the hospital room curtains.

Grandma Blanche and Grandpa Harrison Roscente had stayed up all night and were finally persuaded by Grace and Benjamin Roscente to go home and rest.

Milo Roland rushed in with his backpack to say goodbye, not wanting to be late for his 8 AM class.

Stella Laurent returned from the water dispenser with a basin of warm water, wringing out a towel to gently clean Jenna Roland's face.

Ethan Roscente carefully prepared formula, feeding their newborn with practiced ease.

"Stella, your nursing skills put the professionals to shame," Jenna teased, her complexion much healthier than the night before.

Stella rolled her eyes as she wiped Jenna's fingers. "Only for you. No amount of money could make me do this for anyone else."

"Why are you so good to me?" Jenna tilted her head curiously.

"The paycheck helps," Stella admitted, pausing. "But mostly because without you, my sister and I would've died at Yvonne Valois' hands."

She hadn't even gone home, staying solely to care for Jenna.

"Ethan deserves most of the credit for that," Jenna said, glancing at her husband.

Stella chuckled, wringing the towel again. "Without his beloved wife involved, do you think the mighty Mr. Roscente would've lifted a finger?"

"Don't feel obligated," Jenna murmured.

Stella picked up the basin. "Enough talk. I'll get fresh water."

Once the door closed, Jenna turned to Ethan. "Have you decided on a name?"

"You choose." He didn't look up from the baby.

"I'm not exactly literary," Jenna demurred. "How about Shawn? For a bright future."

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "No culture, huh? That's actually quite good."

"Uneducated doesn't mean illiterate!" Jenna glared.

"Then what about Shawn Roscente?" Ethan suggested. "More complete symbolism."

Jenna's eyes lit up. "The extra syllable does sound better."

"Done." Ethan nodded. "But we should still consult our parents."

"They'll agree with whatever you say," Jenna laughed.

The door swung open. Sophie Roscente entered with Vanessa Galatea trailing behind.

Ethan's expression darkened instantly. "Who invited her?"

Vanessa twisted her fingers nervously, addressing Jenna. "Ms. Roland, I came to apologize. I was wrong to sow discord between you two."

"Actually, I should thank you." Jenna's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Otherwise, I wouldn't have learned about Yvonne Sherwood."

Vanessa bit her lip, turning to Ethan. "Ethan, I promise never to upset Ms. Roland again."
###Chapter 492

Sophie Roscente wore an ingratiating smile. "Sis, Ethan, don't blame Vanessa. She didn't mean it. Let me see my little nephew."

Ethan Roscente stood guard beside the bassinet, his wary gaze sweeping over Vanessa Galatea. Jenna Roland needed rest after childbirth—he wouldn't let petty disturbances trouble her.

"He just fell asleep. Keep your voice down," Ethan murmured in warning.

Sophie tiptoed to the bassinet and lifted a corner of the blanket. A pink, cherubic face greeted her. She clapped a hand over her mouth, eyes sparkling.

"Oh my God! He's absolutely precious!" Sophie bounced on her toes. "Ethan, look! He's blowing bubbles!"

Vanessa seized the moment to edge closer, her painted smile brittle. As the infant's features came into focus, her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

This should have been her child. If not for Jenna's interference, she—Vanessa Galatea—would be standing beside Ethan now.

"You came together?" Jenna's weak voice floated from the hospital bed.

Sophie turned. "I ran into Vanessa at the entrance. Her grandfather's hospitalized here. Since we were heading the same way..."

Jenna gave a faint nod and asked no further.

"Ethan, have you named him yet?" Sophie whispered.

"Shawn Roscente." Ethan's tone was flat, but his eyes never left the bassinet.

"Beautiful name!" Sophie rubbed her hands. "Can I hold him?"

"No." The refusal was absolute.

Sophie pouted. "You're being ridiculous!"

Jenna chuckled. "Your brother barely dares to breathe when holding him. He stayed up all night watching over the baby. Newborns are fragile—he's just being cautious."

"Then...can I at least touch him?" Sophie wheedled.

With permission granted, she extended a single finger and brushed the infant's cheek.

"Wow! Like touching jelly!" Sophie's face flushed with delight.

Jenna's eyes crinkled. "Newborn skin is the softest."

Reluctantly withdrawing her hand, Sophie felt a sudden curiosity about motherhood—until the thought of labor pains made her reconsider instantly.

The door swung open as Stella Laurent entered with a water basin, eyeing the unfamiliar girls.

"This is Ethan's sister Sophie Roscente, and her friend Vanessa Galatea," Jenna introduced.

Stella nodded and went straight to the bedside. "The doctor said no greasy broth. Should I get pigeon soup instead?"

"Yes, please." Jenna smiled gratefully.
###Chapter 493

The fluorescent lights in the hospital corridor were harsh. Sophie Roscente gently pushed open the door to the VIP ward. Inside, Jenna Roland cradled the baby, humming a soft lullaby. The infant slept soundly, cheeks flushed pink.

"I should head home now, sis," Sophie whispered.

Jenna looked up with a tired smile. "Be careful on the road."

Outside the hospital, Sophie pulled out her phone and dialed Vanessa Galatea.

A red sports car soon pulled up at the entrance.

"Need a ride home?" Vanessa rolled down the window.

Sophie slid into the passenger seat. "Thanks."

As they merged onto the main road, Vanessa suddenly spoke. "You actually call her 'sister-in-law' now?"

Sophie's fingers paused on the seatbelt buckle. "She is my brother's wife."

"She's not good enough for Ethan." Vanessa's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel.

Sophie turned to face her. "Vanessa, my brother is happy. Jenna takes great care of the family. Even Grandpa Harrison and Grandma Blanche adore her."

"Such an act!" Vanessa slammed the brakes. "She's just a gold digger!"

Sophie frowned. "She didn't know about the Roscente family's status when they got married."

"What does that matter?" Vanessa sneered. "I've loved Ethan since we were kids. How dare she steal him from me?"

"You can't force feelings." Sophie sighed. "With your looks and background—"

"Help me." Vanessa cut her off. "Make them divorce."

Sophie's eyes widened. "Are you insane? They have a child together!"

Vanessa's expression darkened. "Fine. Forget I asked."

Without warning, she signaled and pulled over. "Change of plans. You'll need to find your own ride."

Sophie blinked. "But taxis never come to this area—"

"Not my problem." The door locks clicked open.

Sophie inhaled sharply and shoved the door open. Cold wind rushed in as she stepped onto the curb without looking back.

The sports car roared away, exhaust fumes hitting Sophie's face.

She took out her phone and blocked Vanessa's number across all platforms.

Three days later, the VIP ward was unusually quiet. Ethan had left to handle an urgent corporate project. Grandpa Harrison had spiked a fever, keeping Grandma Blanche at home. Grace and Benjamin Roscente were attending a relative's birthday celebration, leaving only Jenna and the baby.

When the nurse came for rounds, Jenna sat staring out the window. Sunlight filtered through the glass, casting fractured patterns across her pale face.
###Chapter 494

Sunlight filtered through the curtains as Stella Laurent tucked the blanket around the baby. She turned to Jenna Roland propped against the headboard. "I'll get lunch. What would you like?"

Jenna closed the parenting book in her hands. "Steamed turbot, stir-fried green beans, shredded pork with lettuce, and tomato egg soup." She paused. "Order something you like too."

"That restaurant's abalone soup is famous. I'll bring some back for you." Stella reached for her jacket.

"Alright." Jenna smiled in agreement.

Before leaving, Stella reminded her, "Call me immediately if you need anything."

As the door clicked shut, Jenna considered checking her phone but remembered Stella's warning. She picked up the book instead. Two pages in, the door burst open.

Vanessa Galatea stood silhouetted in black, locking the door behind her.

Jenna straightened instinctively. "Ms. Galatea?"

Vanessa's gaze fixed on the bassinet, her lips curling into a sneer. "The spitting image of Ethan." Her nails dug into her palms.

"Is that why you're here?" Jenna shielded the baby.

Vanessa's head snapped up, eyes glinting dangerously. "Ethan should've been mine! What right does a country bumpkin like you have to steal him?"

Jenna scoffed. "Love isn't about seniority. He never loved you."

"Shut up!" Vanessa shrieked. "I've known him twenty years! Who do you think you are?"

The baby stirred uneasily. Jenna kept her voice low. "Leave. You're frightening him."

"Leave?" Vanessa lunged at the bed. "How long do you think that pretty face will keep Ethan interested? When he tires of you, you won't even have a place to cry!"

Jenna met her gaze squarely. "Still better than you. At least he chose me once."

The words ignited Vanessa's fury. Madness flashed in her eyes. "Then I'll destroy you first!" Her hands slammed onto Jenna's freshly stitched wound.

White-hot pain blinded Jenna as sweat drenched her hospital gown. She clawed at Vanessa's wrists. "Get off! Help—"
###Chapter 495

Jenna Roland's abdomen erupted in searing pain, as if thousands of steel needles were twisting inside her.

She dug her nails into Vanessa Galatea's wrist with bone-crushing force.

Vanessa cried out and violently shook her off.

Four deep gashes oozed blood on the pale skin, the flesh grotesquely torn.

"You bitch!" Vanessa's eyes flashed with venom before her palm cracked across Jenna's face.

Jenna's cheek bloomed crimson, a trickle of blood escaping her split lip.

As Vanessa turned to leave, her gaze caught on the scarlet stain spreading across the white hospital sheets.

Her pupils contracted in panic before she fled the room.

......

Stella Laurent pushed open the hospital door, takeout bag in hand. The metallic tang of blood assaulted her senses.

The bed stood empty, its sheets drenched in shocking red.

The food container hit the floor with a splatter of spilled broth.

Staggering to the nurses' station, her voice trembled. "Where's Jenna? What happened?"

A nurse looked up urgently. "She hemorrhaged suddenly. They're operating on the third floor!"

Stella's knees buckled.

Fumbling for her phone, she dialed Ethan Roscente.

"Mr. Roscente... Jenna's hemorrhaging—"

A deafening crash came through the receiver.

Ethan overturned his coffee cup as he bolted from the conference table, dark liquid ruining documents.

He ran four red lights, tires screeching against asphalt.

His pounding footsteps echoed through hospital stairwells.

When he reached the OR doors, his dress shirt clung to him, soaked with sweat.

"What happened?" He gripped Stella's shoulders. "She was fine this morning!"

Stella shook her head, tears hitting the linoleum. "I only left to get food..."

Ethan staggered back, slamming against the wall.

The glowing surgery sign burned his retinas.

He remembered Jenna's pallid face, her weak request for wonton soup.

Now that soup lay abandoned on the hospital floor.
###Chapter 496

Ethan Roscente clutched his head, knuckles turning white.

His bloodshot eyes remained fixed on the glowing red light above the operating room.

"Jenna will be fine..." His whisper was hoarse, barely audible.

The operating room doors swung open abruptly.

A masked doctor strode out. "Family of Jenna Roland?"

Ethan shot to his feet and rushed forward. "I'm her husband. How is she?"

The doctor removed his mask, expression grave. "She's suffering from postpartum hemorrhage. We need Type B blood immediately, but our blood bank is running low. Is anyone here Type B?"

Ethan's face drained of color.

"I'm not..." His voice shook. "Can you transfer blood from another hospital?"

The doctor shook his head. "There's no time."

Stella Laurent wrung her hands. "I'm not Type B either!"

Then a familiar voice cut through the tension.

"What happened to Jenna?"

Lucien Valois approached swiftly, his suit jacket draped over one arm, forehead glistening with sweat.

Ethan's gaze turned icy as he blocked his path. "What are you doing here?"

Stella quickly intervened. "Mr. Valois, Jenna's hemorrhaging after childbirth. She needs Type B blood!"

Without hesitation, Lucien rolled up his sleeve. "I'm Type B. Take mine."

Ethan grabbed his collar. "Don't think this will—"

"Enough!" Lucien shoved him away. "Saving her comes first!"

The doctor made a swift decision. "Follow me."

Lucien hastily handed his documents and phone to Stella before following the doctor into the operating room.

The sharp scent of antiseptic assaulted his senses.

A nurse handed him sterile scrubs. "Change into these first."

Fumbling with the garments, Lucien shuddered as the cold alcohol swab touched his skin.

When the final door opened, the sight on the operating table froze his blood.

Jenna lay motionless, her face paper-white. The sheets beneath her were soaked crimson.

His legs nearly gave out.

"Will she..." Lucien's voice trembled. "...make it?"

A gurney was wheeled over. "We need that transfusion now!"

As the needle pierced his vein, Lucien stared fixedly at the ceiling.

"Take more," he rasped. "However much you need."

The nurse frowned. "Regulations limit donations to 400 milliliters."

"That won't be enough!" He tried to sit up.

"Don't worry," she pressed him back down. "Additional blood is en route from other hospitals."

Only then did Lucien relax against the bed, closing his eyes.

He remembered coming only to collect his medical report, only to encounter a frantic Ethan in the hallway.

How cruelly ironic fate could be.
###Chapter 497

The operating room lights glared harshly in the sterile hallway. Stella Laurent's fingers trembled as they clutched the hem of her blouse.

Tears slid silently down her cheeks while she stared at the closed doors.

If anything happened to Jenna Roland, she would never forgive herself.

The sudden ringtone made her jump. The caller ID showed "Dad."

"Uncle Vincent, this is Stella..."

Lucien Valois's urgent voice came through the line. "Lucien, we found your sister!"

She ended the call abruptly after a few vague responses, afraid to say too much.

Her gaze flickered toward Ethan Roscente.

The man stood motionless before the operating room doors, his tall frame rigid as a statue.

Thirty minutes later, a nurse rushed past with blood bags.

Lucien emerged, his face ashen and steps unsteady.

"Mr. Valois!" Stella hurried to support him.

Ethan turned, his dark eyes locking onto his rival with unreadable intensity.

"Thank you." His voice was gravelly.

Lucien gave a weak smirk. "Don't mention it. I saved her because I love her."

Their gazes clashed like drawn swords.

"She's my wife." Ethan's pupils darkened.

Leaning against the bench, Lucien laughed bitterly. "So what?"

He stared at the ceiling, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"I know I don't deserve her." The whisper barely reached their ears.

The corridor plunged into tomblike silence.

Only the crimson glow above the operating doors continued its wordless pulse.
###Chapter 498

"She will never be yours." Ethan Roscente's gaze was razor-sharp, his entire being radiating an aura of unyielding dominance.

Lucien Valois let out a bitter laugh. "I know I'm not worthy of her. Ethan, I love Jenna Roland deeply. If you ever dare to hurt her, I'll stake my life to make you pay."

"My woman is none of your concern," Ethan replied coldly.

Stella Laurent intervened tactfully. "Mr. Valois, your father is on the phone. He says it's urgent."

Lucien shot Ethan one last resentful glare before answering. "Dad, what is it?"

"Who was that Stella woman just now?" Vincent Valois demanded, his tone sharp.

"Jenna's friend," Lucien murmured, lowering his voice. "Ethan is here too. I just came to donate blood."

Vincent's anger subsided slightly. "Go to Boys Town orphanage. Secretary Zhang found a lead about your sister."

"Understood."

"And remember—stay away from Jenna!"

Ethan massaged his temples irritably. "Got it."

After hanging up, Lucien turned to Ethan. "Don't tell Jenna I was the blood donor."

"Why?" Ethan frowned.

"She hates me. Knowing the truth would only upset her." Lucien's smile was pained. "I don't want to add to her burdens."

Ethan fell silent for a moment before striding toward the operating room.

Three hours later, the surgical lights finally dimmed.

"The patient is out of danger," the doctor announced, wheeling out the hospital bed. "She'll need two days in the ICU for observation."

Ethan exhaled deeply, the tension in his body finally easing.

Suddenly, his expression darkened. "Where's the baby?"

Stella gasped, realizing they'd forgotten about the newborn. She rushed back to the ward in panic.

The empty bassinet made her legs buckle.

"Over here," a nurse said, appearing with the bottle-fed infant. "I brought him over since no one was attending to him."

Stella nearly burst into tears. "Thank you so much!"

Her hands trembled as she updated Ethan, then carefully cradled the contented baby.
###Chapter 499

Ethan Roscente hadn't slept for two full days outside the ICU. He couldn't bring himself to tell Grandma Blanche the truth, insisting over the phone that Jenna Roland was recovering well.

When Jenna was wheeled out of intensive care, she looked gaunt, her face as pale as parchment. Weakly lying on the hospital bed, she felt Ethan immediately grasp her hand, pressing a trembling kiss to her knuckles.

"Darling..." His voice cracked, eyes bloodshot. "If anything happened to you, I wouldn't want to live either."

Jenna forced a weak smile, her voice hoarse. "Our parents are watching over me from heaven. How's the baby?"

She should've been discharged long ago, but nearly died from postpartum hemorrhage. The memory of Vanessa Galatea's twisted face flashed in her mind, igniting fury in Jenna's eyes.

"It was Vanessa." She gritted her teeth. "When Stella went to get food, she barged in and pressed down on my stomach—"

Ethan's pupils constricted, a murderous aura radiating from him. He suppressed his rage, not wanting to frighten their child.

Stella gasped, covering her mouth. "It was her?!"

"I truly thought..." Jenna's tears spilled over. "I'd never see any of you again."

"Don't be afraid." Stella clasped her icy hand. "Once you recover, we'll make her pay!"

Ethan's gaze turned glacial. "No need to wait." He pulled out his phone and dialed. "Bring Vanessa to me."

Hanging up, he gently caressed Jenna's cheek. "No one who hurts you will escape justice."

His phone rang again. Grandma Blanche's caller ID made him frown. "She's called over a dozen times these past two days. I kept saying you were asleep."

Jenna nodded understandingly. Answering the call, she heard Grandma Blanche's anxious voice: "Jenna dear, are you alright?"

"Grandma, I just woke up." Jenna summoned her strength. "Just feeling extra sleepy. Sorry for worrying you."

"Thank goodness! Rest well then."

After hanging up, Ethan scoffed. "She didn't even ask about me once."

Jenna chuckled weakly. "I just had a baby. Cut me some slack."

He playfully pinched her nose. "Fair enough."
###Chapter 500

Stella asked cautiously, "Mr. Roscente, how do you plan to deal with Vanessa?"

A ruthless glint flashed in Ethan's eyes. "She dared to lay a finger on Jenna. I'll make sure she begs for death."

Stella shivered under his icy gaze.

Vanessa must have a death wish, targeting Jenna like that.

Didn't she know how terrifying Ethan could be?

Even Lucien's father avoided crossing Ethan, let alone the entire Valois family.

This time, Vanessa had truly messed with the wrong person.

As evening fell, Ethan's phone rang.

It was Xavier.

After a brief call, Ethan hung up.

He turned to Jenna. "We've got her. I'll be back soon."

"Go ahead." Jenna nodded obediently. "If anyone else shows up, I'll have Stella smash them with a vase."

Ethan ruffled her hair before leaving.

The black Rolls-Royce sped toward Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild.

This was one of Ethan's properties, usually guarded by Xavier and his team.

Within half an hour, the car stopped in front of Villa 88.

Xavier had been waiting in the courtyard.

"Where is she?" Ethan's voice was glacial.

"In the basement." Xavier led the way respectfully. "This way, sir."

The basement was dimly lit, with only a single swaying bulb.

A woman in black was tied to a chair in the center.

Her eyes were blindfolded, her mouth sealed tightly with duct tape.

Hearing footsteps, she struggled violently, muffled whimpers escaping.

Ethan raised a hand.

Xavier immediately removed the blindfold and tape.

Vanessa's eyes widened in terror. "E-Ethan?!"

"Surprised?" Ethan looked down at her coldly. "Didn't think about consequences when you attacked Jenna?"

Vanessa's face turned deathly pale.

All she'd wanted was Jenna dead!

How could that bitch survive after losing so much blood?

"Ethan, let me explain—" Her voice trembled.

Ethan waved impatiently. "Do it."

Xavier and the bodyguards stepped forward, fists raining down.
