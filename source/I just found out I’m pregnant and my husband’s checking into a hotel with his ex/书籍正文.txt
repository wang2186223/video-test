###Chapter 1 Her Husband Took His First Love To A Hotel
Hannah Scott bitterly learned that her husband,Vincent Jones, hooked up with his first love-the twNO of them checked into a hotel together. She watched it all unfold, unable to look away. His first love bore an uncanny resemblance to her.

From about ten meters away, Hannah pulled out her phone and called Vincent. "Didn't your grandmother suggest we take the health examination since we're trying for a baby? Are you free right now?"
"I'm busy with a business dinner. Not tonight-maybe next time," Vincent answered.
"Alright," Hannah replied, keeping her voice even before she hung up. Unbelievable. There he was,about to entertain another woman in a hotel room,and he still had the nerve to mention "next time."
Hannah trailed behind them and stopped at their hotel room door. Laughter and flirtatious voices spilled out once they were inside. For a moment, she considered barging in and confronting them on the spot. But she held back. Her fury faded quickly,replaced by a deep and lasting disappointment. That was when she knew it was time to let go.

Hannah wasted no time contacting a lawyer to draft a divorce agreement. Barely after she signed her name, Danica Jones, Vincent's mother, asked to meet.

The two women met at a small café and settled in across from each other.

"You probably haven't heard, but Brinley is back,"Danica said condescendingly.

Brinley Gilbert. She was Vincent's first love, and Danica had always adored her.
Danica leaned in, her tone casual, almost delighted."Name your price. How much does it take for you to walk away from Vincent?"
Danica had never approved of Hannah, largely due to
her unremarkable background. She sought to pair her son with a wealthy socialite who could help expand the Jones Group.
Hannah kept her voice steady. "Transfer every property under your name to me, and I'll give your beloved son his freedom."
Danica had a special love for luxury real estate. She owned several high-end properties with a total worth exceeding billions.
"You're serious?" Danica looked genuinely surprised by how quickly Hannah agreed. For five whole years,Hannah had lived as Vincent's secret wife, giving up her own career, never seeking attention, and taking on the role of the perfect housewife behind closed doors.Most people assumed she was desperately in love with Vincent.
"Yeah. I've had enough. I'm finished here. I just want out," Hannah remarked. As Brinley's face flashed through her thoughts, a deep coldness settled over her. She realized Vincent had never loved her. He  married her only because she looked like his first love.


It all made sense now. No wonder he would never say "I love you" no matter how many times she asked.Though her chest tightened, she refused to shed a single tear. He was just a man, nothing special. Like garbage-meant to be tossed aside.


Danica's lips curled into a satisfied smile. In her eyes,Hannah was never good enough for her son-her background too ordinary and her manners frivolous."You've finally become somewhat sensible. But there's one more condition. You can't breathe a word about this secret marriage, and Vincent must never find out about our deal."



"Agreed." Hannah's smile turned cold. "Once the divorce goes through, all ten of your properties are mine."



"Five properties. We're still family now. You could at least offer me that," Danica suggested.


"Absolutely not," HHannah said as she rose from her seat. "Unless you'd rather I stay on as Vincent's wife -and we both know that role is worth far more than ten properties."
Danica's face tightened. Her answer came through gritted teeth. "Fine."
After leaving the café, Hannah stopped in front of a fountain and lingered for several minutes, her mind in turmoil. Then, finally, she made up her mind. She slid her wedding ring off her finger, tossed it into the fountain, and walked away without glancing back.
For the first time, she stepped into a private club,ordered a round of drinks, and hired a few male escorts to keep her company-every one of them charming, well-built, and perfectly put together.She could touch whoever caught her eye. Any one of these smooth-talking and good-looking escorts was far better than the cold, distant husband she was leaving behind.
Her presence didn't go unnoticed. Bobby Howard, a longtime friend of Vincent's, caught sight of her across the crowded club. He remembered her always   bright  trailing after Vincent, never once claiming even the title of girlfriend.


Watching her laughing and flirting with those dashing male escorts, Bobby pulled out his phone and called Vincent.



"You need anything?" Vincent's tone was as cold as ever.


"You and your little tagalong have a fight?"


Vincent didn't respond.


"I just saw her at the club," Bobby added. "She went into a private room with a handful of male escorts."


Vincent's tone was clipped. "Text me the address.And the room number."
###Chapter 2 Tricked Him Into SigningThe Divorce Agreement
 

Hannah lounged in the private room, drinking one colorful cocktail after another. Every glass tasted sweet and packed a punch, and soon a pink flush colored her cheeks, her eyes hazy with drink.


She glanced at the male escorts around her, each one young, striking, and sculpted to perfection. Yet,even in the middle of all that attention, a dull sadness weighed her down. She felt the urge to cry because no matter how much she drank, her thoughts kept drifting backto that bastard husband of hers.


Hannah lifted her wrist and flashed the diamond bracelet. "Whoever can make me the happiest tonight gets this," she remarked, her voice smooth and low. "It's worth a hundred grand."



It had been a gift from Vincent-something she used to treasure. But not anymore. She wanted neither thebracelet nor the man who gave it to her.


The escorts wasted no time. One started grinding up behind her, moving in rhythm with the music.Another leaned close, whispering sweet nothings in her ear.A third flexed his abs and chest as if showing off at a fitness competition.


Then, one of them, a little bolder than the rest,bent in close and murmured, "My tongue game's next-level.Wanna try?"


Hannah let out a languid smile. "Why not?" This guy was cute-puppy-eyed, gentle. Nothing like Vincent,whose sharp features and cold gaze always made him seem unapproachable. She'd been with Vincent long enough. Maybe it was time for a change of taste.


Unclasping the bracelet, Hannah handed it over without hesitation. "Take it. It's yours now."


As the guy leaned in for a kiss, Hannah matched his move with a grin. But before their lips could touch,a strong arm shot out, dragging her back against a  familiar chest.



The scent hit her instantly. Clean, cool, unmistakably him. She didn't even need to look up. She knew who it was."Let go of me," she murmured, her voice thick with liquor and stubborn pride. "I haven't even had the chance to kiss him yet."


Vincent held her tighter, not letting go. "Enough."


All around, the escorts froze in confusion and annoyance.





"Who the hell are you?" one of them questioned."You can't just take our client away."


Vincent's expression clouded over. "Leave," he instructed.





The weight of his voice left no room for argument.Every escort hurried to collect their things and scrambled to the door without another word.


Still holding Hannah close, Vincent caught sight of the bracelet-now in the hand of one of the retreating escorts.
"Wait," Vincent snapped. "Hand over the bracelet."
The guy stopped, glancing down at the jewelry. "But she gave it to me."
Vincent stared him down, completely unconvinced.He remembered that bracelet. Hannah cherished it like it was priceless. There was no chance she'd give it away if she were sober. This guy must have coaxed it out of her, taking advantage of her drunkenness.
"Give it back," Vincent said, his voice low and threatening.
Without further protest, the guy surrendered the bracelet.

Still tipsy, Hannah reached for the guy. "Don't leave yet," she called out, her voice dreamy. "Didn't you say your tongue was amazing? I haven't tested it yet..."
Hannah squirmed in Vincent's hold, pouting and whining, until he kissed her firmly. The fight left her in an instant.
 Later, once back home, Vincent pressed her gently against the door. Her hair tumbled in every direction,her gaze unfocused, and a bright flush colored her cheeks from the alcohol.
Vincent quietly slipped the bracelet back onto her wrist. "Wear it. I'll be around more often from now on."
A little laugh escaped her. So that was what he thought? That she was throwing a tantrum because he hadn't been home enough?
She tried to wriggle away, but he pulled her close again. She bristled in his arms, tense and ready to snap.
Vincent moved in slowly, his lips almost touching hers. That was when she caught the scent clinging to him. Another woman's perfume. Fury flashed through her as she shoved him back and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. "Don't touch me."

A wave of revulsion swept through her, and she darted into the bathroom.


Vincent was right behind her, barely a step away. He held her hair back as she bent over the sink, his palm resting gently on her back. "Is it really that bad?"
She didn't answer.
Just then, his phone vibrated. She managed to see the name on the screen-Brinley.
He stepped away to take the call. A moment passed before he returned, reached for his jacket, and said,"Work called.I have to head out."
Work? Hannah walked out of the bathroom, her eyes flickering toward the clock. The display read three a.m. Who would be calling about business in the middle of the night? It could only mean one thing.He must be leaving to meet his first love.
Hannah sobered up instantly. "Hold on. Your mother needs your signature on these papers." She rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a few documents, and passed them to him.
Vincent barely glanced at the pages as he scribbled   his name. He then walked out the door without looking back. Had he paid more attention, he would have realized the last document was a divorce agreement.

Brinley had called about a supposed sudden pain in her stomach, and Vincent had wasted no time driving her to the hospital, where he stayed until the morning.
When Vincent finally returned home, Hannah was still fast asleep, curled up in last night's clothes. He changed her into her pajamas, prepared a glass of lemon water, and placed it on the dining table before leaving quietly for work.
Hours passed, and Hannah woke up with a throbbing headache, feeling completely drained. She noted a text from Vincent on her phone."Are you feeling any better?"
She decided not to reply. Walking out of her room she spotted a glass of lemon water waiting for her on the dining table. "Thank you, Aubrey," she said to the housekeeper.
 Aubrey Palmer, the housekeeper, returned her gratitude with a smile. "Mrs. Jones, I think it was Mr.Jones who prepared this."

Hannah lowered her eyes. Thoughtfulness had always come naturally to Vincent, both when they were just dating and after they got married. Yet now,that kindness felt empty. He was gentle with her, not out of love, but because her face bore a resemblance to Brinley's. Brinley was the one he truly loved.

Hannah took a few careful sips. "Please take this away," she said to Aubrey.
She then reached for the divorce agreement and made a call to Danica. "You can get started on transferring the properties."
A spark of excitement came through in Danica's voice. "So he signed it?"
"Yes, he did." Hannah paused for a moment. "Let's hold off for a month before we tell everyone else in the family about the divorce. I'll move out after that."ight Her reason for waiting was simple. Sharon Jones,Vincent's grandmother, was about to turn seventy.Touched by Sharon's consistent kindness toward her,she couldn't bring herself to soil Sharon's mood by breaking out the divorce news.


When the call ended, "Nova Tech Rumored to Be Facing Bankruptcy" appeared on her phone news feed.


Nova Tech was the company Hannah had founded back in college. It had made a name for itself nationwide, specializing in women's safety products.But after getting married, she'd left behind her business, her dreams, and her entire future. She had lost herself completely in love, and Vincent had taken over her whole world.



Hannah's stomach dropped as she read the headline.Pondering for a while, she eventually got dressed to meet her old business partner, Felix Wade.
###Chapter 3 He Brought The OtherWoman Home

Felix looked up as soon as Hannah stepped inside his office, and his words came out sharp with sarcasm."The full-time housewife decided to show up and watch us fall apart? Sorry, I have work to do. Don't have time to entertain you."


Felix had a good reason to nurture displeasure toward Hannah. Back when the company had been a huge success with orders coming in faster than they could deal with, Hannah had walked away without even glancing back, and nobody had been able to make her stay. And in the five years since, she hadn't contacted anyone from the company-not even once. So seeing her now, he didn't bother to mince his words or mask his true feelings.


"I'm sorry for my past absence," Hannah said, voice soft as she lowered her gaze. "I only came hoping to find out if there's anything I can do to help."



A cold, bitter laugh escaped Felix. "Oh, are you done playing the perfect housewife behind closed doors?Thought you'd swing by and save us now?"


He tossed a folder onto the floor, the sound sharp in the quiet room. The glare in his eyes said it all. "It's too late. We don't need your help. The company's finished.You happy now?"


Taking a deep breath to steady herself, Hannah answered in an even tone, "Felix, I understand that you're upset. But we should focus on solving the company crisis right now."


Anger filled his voice. "We're on the brink of bankruptcy. What the hell can a full-time housewife like you do to change anything?" He didn't bother to wait for a reply, already gathering his things like he was leaving for good.


Her jaw clenched. Emotion flickered in her eyes. After a moment, she spoke. "I'm getting divorced."

 Felix stood frozen, disbelief written across his face."What did you just say?"


"If things unfold the way I expect, I'll walk away with a solid payout," she said, drawing out each word."So..." Reaching out her hand, she finished her thought. "So, what do you think? Want to bring our business back to life?"







Hannah made her way out of the company with a stack of documents, all provided by Felix, for her to grasp the company's crisis.


However, once home, as she nudged her room door open, she froze. Right there, on her bed, lay Brinley,tucked into Vincent's arms.


A chill swept through Hannah, leaving her numb.Suddenly, a laugh escaped her lips-not from amusement, but from her shattered heart and simmering fury. Vincent really couldn't help himself,could he? He was cheating in their house now? Or perhaps he just liked the thrill of being caught.
<###Chapter 3 He Brought The Other Woman Honie  +120 Po.nte at most "Seriously, Vincent, you're bringing the other woman to our house now?" Hannah demanded.

Vincent carefully helped Brinley sit up and then walked toward Hannah. "Why didn't you tell me before you left?"
Hannah sneered, "Why should I bother? It's not like my schedule has ever stopped you from inviting your latest fling over."
Vincent's voice dropped. "Brinley and I have known each other since we were kids. She's practically family. That's all. There's nothing between uS."
Hannah couldn't stop herself from rolling her eyes."Really? So, you're going to sleep with your 'family'now?"

Tension tightened Vincent's face. He opened his mouth to reply, but Brinley beat him to it.

Brinley offered her hand. "Hi, I'm Brinley. It's good to finally meet you. People always told me we look a lot alike." She then glanced at Vincent. "
misunderstand. Vincent was only helping me earlier..."



Hannah kept her arms at her sides and let her annoyance show. She had no intention of returning Brinley's gesture. A sharp edge crept into her words."Misunderstand what? That you threw yourself at my husband?"



Brinley's lips pressed together as she turned a wounded gaze on Vincent.


A cold, hard note filled Vincent's voice. "Hannah, I've already explained the situation to you. Stop making a fuss over nothing."


"Making a fuss over nothing? Isn't she your first love?" Mixed feelings crept into Hannah's face. Her voice dropped as she finally let out the question that had haunted her since witnessing the scene the other day. "Vincent, did you only marry me because l look like her?" She swung her arm to point straight at Brinley, eyes fixed on Vincent the whole time.

 
Vincent shifted his gaze away. No answer came from his lips.


That silence hurt worse than anything he could have said. Hannah felt something break inside her.Deep down, she had already known the answer, but seeing the truth come out in his silence felt like someone had cut right through her. A bitter laugh slipped out."I get it. Let's just get a divorce. There's no point in dragging this relationship out."


Vincent's brow furrowed. "Really? Throwing a divorce threat over this minor issue? When can you be a little more mature?" His expression turned cold. "Fine.Since you don't like Brinley, I won't bring her around anymore.Satisfied?"


Hannah didn't bother to respond. She'd already tricked him into signing the divorce agreement. She was set on walking away from this torment of marriage,and arguing with him seemed pointless.


Vincent's tone made it clear the conversation was over. "This whole fuss ends right now. I don't want to hear another word about divorce."
 With that, he led Brinley to the door.


Hannah wasted no time in asking the housekeeper to prepare a spare bedroom. She would not sleep on the bed tainted by his sweetheart again.


She thought about how she and Vincent had dated for three years before marriage and then spent five more as husband and wife. Her feelings for him had started with nothing more than the appeal of his looks.



At that time, he had just been fresh out of a heartbreak from the end of a relationship. Drawn in by his good looks, she'd practically glued to his side every single day to make her feelings transparent. To anyone willing to hear her out, she'd remarked with certainty, "I'm going to make Vincent Jones fall in love with me."



Her strategy had been simple-bringing him flowers every day, showing up with snacks, and asking him,again and again, "Fallen for me yet?"


Back then, she had been bold. She'd declared her love for him in front of anyone, never bothered by the eyes watching her. Most days, however, Vincent had acted like she didn't even exist.



Later on, a moment alone in the university equipment storage room had finally given her the chance she wanted. Cornering him against the wall, she'd flashed a playful grin and teased, "If you don't say yes to being my boyfriend, I'm going to kiss you right now."



That day, he hadn't said yes or no. Instead,he'd simply pulled her into his arms. Now, as she looked back, she realized she shouldn't have taken his silence as agreement.


The reason their marriage fell apart was painfully simple. Vincent's love for her had never been strong enough to hold it together. And she'd poured everything into him, loving with all her heart,yet what she received always fell short of her expectations leaving her frustrated. Over time, disappointment weighed her down until her heart went numb.Brinley's presence simply became the last push that broke her completely.
On the way to drive Brinley back, Vincent's expression stayed stormy. Brinley reached out, her fingers brushing his arm. "Vincent,I-"
He moved away from her touch. "Brinley, make sure today's event never repeats itself."
###Chapter 4 It Was Brinley's Voice




For several days straight, Vincent returned home each night just in time fordinner with Hannah. Every evening, as soon as the meal ended, he hurried right back to his office.


That particular night, Hannah turned in early. The next day, morning light woke her, and she soon noticed an arm draped around her waist. Vincent had come into the guest room and fallen asleep beside her.She could not recall the last time he slept at home.


When she tried to slip away, his hold only tightened.The closeness sent her heart into a wild rhythm.


"You're awake?" he murmured, his voice hoarse from the sleep.


"Yeah."


"I got something for you." He straightened up and reached for an elegant gift box resting on the nightstand.
"This purple gemstone necklace-it's one of a kind."His tone grew gentle. "Would you like me to put it on you?"
Hannah let him, gathering her hair to make room as he fastened the necklace around her neck.He always knew what suited her. The color brought out the best in her features.
Without warning, Vincent leaned closer, his lips skimming along the side of her neck and sending a tickling shiver across her skin. "Didn't Grandma mention we should think about having a baby?" His hand moved slowly toward the edge of her dress."Why don't we make one now?"

His familiar scent closed in around her, and her body instinctively responded. Eight years of loving Vincent had left its mark. Every reaction gave her feelings away. But she was no longer the girl she had been eight years ago. Logic now held more power over her than longing ever could. A divorce loomed over them.
She could not imagine bringing a child into a marriage on the verge of ending.
Carefully, Hannah placed a hand on his chest and pushed him back. "I'm not feeling up to it today."
Vincent made another attempt. "Is something wrong?"

A quiet answer left her lips."No, I'm just tired."
He heard the finality in her voice and knew she meant every word. Reluctantly, he let her go. Still restless, he decided to take a cold shower. But before he could reach the bathroom, his phone buzzed with a call from Brinley.A scowl crossed his face. Muttering about needing to get back to work,he left the room.

Hannah had no doubts about who he was really going to meet-Brinley. Once he was gone, she sat up and pulled out the documents Felix had handed her. The hours slipped by as she read through every page. Her notes filled every margin of the documents -page corners dog-eared, sections underlined，
 questions scribbled in bold.Reaching for her phone, she sent Felix a message."Are you available? I've got some questions about the company."
His response came without delay. "Let's talk over dinner tomorrow. And it's your treat."

The following day, they met at the Gilded Restaurant.Felix spent most of the meal outlining the company's struggles from the last few years. Hannah listened intently, concern visible in the lines on her face.
She tapped the stack of papers in front of her. "Have you noticed how our women's safety products have all started to look and feel the same? There's nothing
new anymore."
Felix nodded. "We have tried to bring in new ideas,but nothing seemed to take off."

"Have you ever thought about using Al? We could develop a smart assistant that would really transform our whole product lineup."
Felix leaned back and answered honestly, "The idea has come up, but with our company struggling, no one wants to partner with us."


A spark of hope lit her voice. "I heard the CEO of VitraMind is coming back to the country. Maybe we could-"



Before she could finish, a familiar voice interrupted her. "Well, what a coincidence. Fancy seeing you here."



Brinley approached their table, smiling.


The moment Hannah spotted Brinley, her mood soured. "Don't act like we're that close."



Then, Hannah's eyes landed on the necklace around Brinley's neck, the very same purple gemstone necklace Vincent had claimed was "'one of a kind."She sneered inwardly. So much for one of a kind. He had given her and Brinley each an identical gemstone necklace. She should have known better than to trust his words.

Having made her point, Brinley turned and walked off,but not before casually snapping a photo of Hannah and Felix together from a distance.


Elsewhere, Vincent was busy sending a text to Hannah. "I'll be home for dinner tonight." He believed that after last night, things had gone back to normal.He hadn't taken her talk of divorce seriously and just assumed it was another outburst. In his mind,she loved him too much to walk away.


Suddenly, his phone vibrated. A photo arrived.It showed Hannah at dinner with another man. He zoomed in, noticing right away that she wasn't wearing her wedding ring. A muscle jumped in his jaw, and his eyes went cold.


Meanwhile,since Gilded Restaurant was known as a gathering spot for the city's wealthy, that afternoon,besides running into Brinley, Hannah also crossed paths with several people from the privileged circle.


Voices drifted behind her, sharp enough to cut.


"Looks like Hannah's hooked herself a new loaded Voice guy.""You didn't hear? Brinley's back in town. Vincent must have dumped her already."
"Word is, Vincent drove Brinley back after she got wasted last night."
"Seriously? And Hannah just let it slide?"
"Probably settled with money. H fast, doesn't she? Already has som side."	annah moves on eone new by her
"Honestly, Hannah is a stunner. That figure, that face... Man, I'd pay just to get a handful.Wonder what her rate is?"

The men burst out laughing, crude and careless, not bothering to keep their voices down.

Hannah glanced at Felix, giving him a small smile."Excuse me a moment. I have something to handle."

She then strode right over to the group of men, her smile steady. "Were you talking about me?"
Some of the men shrank back, but one spoke up,bold as ever. "What? It's not like we've said anything wrong.You were never even Vincent's girlfriend-just a kept woman. Now you're out, and we're not allowed to talk about it?"

Hannah's smile turned sharper. "Actually, you couldn't have been more wrong. When I was with Vincent, Brinley wasn't even in the picture yet.I got bored and tossed him aside. Understand?"

Then, she fixed her eyes on the man who'd made the crude joke. "And as for you?" She sized him up from head to toe, her smile cold. "You look likean overstuffed pig in an expensive shirt. I'd rather kill myself than let you anywhere near me."

Without missing a beat, she grabbed a glass of red wine and splashed it right across his chest.

The man shot to his feet, rage twisting his face, and reached for her. Felix moved quicker, stepping in between them and seizing the man's wrist. His voice stayed calm. "Trying to lay hands on a woman? Real classy."
"Ouch! Damn it. Let go!" the man cried out in pain.
Felix tightened his grip just a little. "If I held on any tighter, you'd be in a sling." A hard look from him followed."Now scram."
The man hurried off, humiliated and red-faced.
Hannah smiled at Felix, her tone light. "Appreciate it.But I am afraid we'll have to finish our conversation another time."
Felix shrugged. "No worries. We'll pick it up next time." He took a moment to study her expression. "If I'm not mistaken, you were married to Vincent,right?" Nothing like those rumors about her being kept.
She answered without hesitation, "Yeah. But divorce is on the way."
There was a flicker of delight in his eyes, though quickly followed by concern. "Did he treat you badly?"
A pause followed before Hannah replied, "We just couldn't make it work anymore." She looked away and gave a dry laugh. "Funny, isn't it? When I left the company five years ago, I really thought I'd be happy.Looks like I was wrong."


Felix shook his head. "That's alright. You get married to be happy. You leave for the same reason."


A small smile played on her lips. "That's true."


They fell into step together, walking side by side. As they passed a private dining room, a high, breathless woman's voice echoed into the hall. "Vincent... Don't stop... Ah, right there... Yes, that's perfect... You feel incredible..."



Hannah stopped in her tracks. There was no mistaking it-Brinley's voice. Her legs refused to budge despite her desire to leave. Tears gathered in her eyes and fell before she could blink them away.
###Chapter 5 Moved Out
Hearing the woman's moan floating from inside the private room, Felix caught on at once and quickly steered Hannah away.


Barely aware of her own steps, Hannah drifted forward, her gaze unfocused. Felix stayed by her side, neither of them saying a word for quite some time.



"You should go back," Hannah said quietly. "I'm fine by myself."


Felix shook his head. "Let me take you home."


A pause hung between them before she gave in."Alright."


It was already past midnight by the time they reached Hannah's place.



One unshakable thought dominated Hannah's thoughts-she needed to gather her things and move out. There was no way she would spend another night with Vincent under the same roof.


Vincent was already home, waiting for Hannah's return. His eyes narrowed the instant he recognized Felix, the same man from that photograph. The tension in his jaw made it impossible to miss his displeasure.


"Why did you come back so late?" Vincent asked,though Hannah paid him no attention. She moved past him and walked straight to her room.


Felix gave a short, mocking laugh. "You're fast. Did you enjoy yourself?"


Vincent didn't respond to Felix's inexplicable jab. He plastered on a polite smile, his voice cool. "Thanks for bringing my wife home." He made a point of stressing the words "my wife" before turning around.


Felix nearly laughed at his misplaced possessiveness. In the end, he said nothing and left quietly.
Vincent strode into the bedroom and caught Hannah stuffing clothes into her suitcase. His brows furrowed as he walked over and yanked the luggage from her hands. "Where do you think you're going at this late hour?" The words came out sharp and brittle.


That photograph of Hannah dining with another man had haunted Vincent all day. Even after he wrapped up at the office, the image hadn't left his mind.He'd rushed back home, only to find it empty. His calls to Hannah went unanswered. Thus, he waited for her to return home.



For hours, the house stayed empty. And now, when she finally came back, she wasn't alone-she had come back with the very man from the photo, the one she had dined with.



Not sparing him a look, Hannah kept gathering her belongings. Her tone was cold. "It's not your problem."


Anger flickering across his eyes, he grabbed her wrist sharply. His grip was rough-too tight. She tried to wriggle free but failed. Red marks quickly appeared, pain radiating up her arm.


Realizing what he'd done, he reined himself in and muttered, "Didn't mean to."


Hannah's body shook, her mind flooded with scenes conjured up based on Brinley's moans-images of Vincent and Brinley making love. Disgust and anger washed over her in an instant. With a fierce push, she shoved him aside. "Get out of my way. I'm moving out."



His brow tightened with confusion. "This is your home. Where do you plan to run off to?"


A hollow laugh escaped her lips as tears tracked down her cheek. She wiped them away quickly,her voice dropping to a whisper. "This place stopped feeling like home the moment you lét Brinley through the door."



Vincent stiffened as he grasped her meaning immediately. He frowned, frustration bubbling up."You're overthinking it. I told you. There's nothing between us. If you really hate her that much, I'll keep her away from here. That's it. She'll never come to our home again."


Vincent's arms wrapped around her waist from behind, pulling her into his arms, her back against his chest. His hold was firm, almost desperate.


Frost gathered in Hannah's eyes. She'd caught him with Brinley three times. And he still expected her to believe himn? How ridiculous.



She tried to break free from his embrace, but he held her tightly. "Let go of me,"she said, her voice sharp as glass.


His grip only tightened. "No. You're not leaving me.Not ev/er."



Facing off with Vincent never got her anywhere.She knew that all too well. There was no winning in a head-on fight. So, she stopped struggling, her shoulders lowering, and she softened her voice to a whisper. "Alright, you win, I'll stay, Just let go of me."


Vincent shifted to face her, loosening his grip just enough, but still kept his arms wrapped around her waist, his face nestled into the crook of her neck. He loved holding her like this.

But then, an unwelcome thought gnawed at Vincent.The image of the man who'd dropped Hannah home wouldn't leave him alone. His tone turned cold. "Who exactly was the guy who dropped you off?"
Without missing a beat, Hannah gave an indifferent answer. "Just a friend," she said, inching her body away from his grasp.
Vincent's grip only tightened as suspicion crept in.His voice dropped lower. "Strange-I don't recall you ever introducing us."
No answer came from her lips. Rarely did Vincent concern himself with the details of her world. For as long as she could remember, she'd always revolved around him, never the other way around.
Sensing her mood shift, Vincent tried to steer the conversation elsewhere."Once things settle down,let's take a trip. Clear our heads a little-then maybe we can try for a baby."


In the past, hearing such words would have sent Hannah over the moon. Now, however, the words just washed over her, meaningless. He had been tricked by her into signing the divorce agreement without even realizing it. Only twenty-three days left before his grandmother's seventieth birthday. Once the celebration wrapped up, she would walk away from his world entirely.


Hannah just gave a soft, noncommittal response.


Vincent's fingers traced the outline of her bare ring finger. A faint indentation lingered where her wedding ring once sat. "Did you take your ring off?"


Hannah slid her hand free. "Lost it accidentally," she replied, voice barely above a whisper.


Undeterred, Vincent caught her hand once more, his thumb sweeping over the faint mark on her ring finger. "It's been years. Maybe it's time we redesigned the set. Tell me what style you like-I'll have someone draw it up."
Nothing about the conversation appealed to her."Let's talk about it latershe said, shutting the topic down. She nudged him away, her tone turning brisk as she thought of his getting laid with Brinley. "You should get cleaned up."

A smile crossed his face as he tugged her closer."Why don't you join me? It's been forever since we shared a shower."

She stepped back and shook her head, her words deliberately misleading him. "You go ahead. Didn't you say we should try making a baby?"
"Alright," Vincent replied, starting to loosen his tie as he disappeared into the bathroom.
The second the door clicked shut, Hannah snatched up her phone. She dialed her closest friend, Rena Brown. "Can you come get me?"
Within ten minutes, headlights flashed in the driveway. Rena had arrived. Hannah didn't bother packing anymore. All she grabbed was a folder of company documents before heading out the door.
When Vincent finally stepped out from the bathroom,water still dripping from his hair, he saw only an empty room. His wife was gone.

 ###Chapter 6 Is That What You ReallyTell Your Mistress About Me

Once picking up Hannah and taking her to her place Rena arranged things with quiet efficiency. She made sure Hannah had everything she could possibly need.

Years of friendship since their college days meant Rena knew the whole story-from Hannah's first date with Vincent to the unraveling of their marriage.
Once the fresh linens were in place, Rena glanced over her shoulder and handed Hannah a pilloW."You're really done with Vincent this time, aren't you?No going back?"
Without missing a beat, Hannah took the pillow and nodded. "Yes. Even the idea of going back makes my skin crawl."

Instant approval flashed in Rena's eyes. "You deserve better, you know that. I never saw what you did in him."


There was no hesitation in Rena's voice-she'd always been against Vincent. Watching Hannah leave him felt like watching someone finally wake up from a bad dream. Anyone who met Hannah couldn't miss her striking looks-tall, elegant, skin like porcelain,and hair that caught the light in soft amber waves.She had the kind of presence that turned heads, so why spend another second on a man who never valued her?



Rena broke the brief silence. "Alright, what's your next move?"



Determination flared in Hannah's eyes. "It's simple.I'm bringing Nova Tech back. That's my only focus now." She paused and then looked hopeful. "Actually Rena, do you have a way to help me connect with Miles Whitaker-the CEO of VitraMind?" If there was ever a person to open doors in the elite's world,it was Rena. Her connections seemed endless, though even she sometimes hit a wall.
 Hearing that name, Rena had frowned for the first time all night. "Miles isn't easy to reach. Best I can do is find out where he'll be and when."


Hannah smiled, grateful. "That's more than enough."


Night stretched on as the two friends talked about everything and nothing, until Rena finally drifted off to sleep.


Alone in the quiet, Hannah nursed a beer, her thoughts involuntarily spiraling back to Vincent. How did things between them end up like this? All these years together, he'd never really opened his heart to her. He hadn't even offered a single explanation for treating her as a stand-in. Nobody could call this anything but a farce. Deep down, she understood.She'd never truly mattered to him. Love had never been part of the equation.



Tears stung her eyes, but she brushed them away with a shaky hand. Right then, she made herself a promise: this would be the last time she'd cried over Vincent.
Morning sunlight found Danica hunching over a chessboard with Brinley as her opponent.
Out of nowhere,Danica's phone buzzed. Hannah's name lit up the screen.
Pausing the game, Danica flashed the caller ID toward Brinley before answering. "What's up?"
"Are the property transfer procedures done?"Hannah's voice sounded rough, as if she hadn't slept at all.

A quick exchange of looks passed between Danica and Brinley. "Of course not. Only three went through," Danica responded, her words crisp.
"Hand those over first," Hannah replied.
"Alright, just swing by when you get a chance."Leaning back, Danica remarked, deliberately sounding casual, "By the way, I heard you moved out."

The memory of Vincent's late-night phone call about whether Hannah had come to her place and his  anxious tone flashed through Danica's mind.


"Yeah," Hannah answered and then ended the call without a moment's pause.


Danica frowned at the blank screen. "How rude," she muttered to herself.


But the moment Danica looked at Brinley, her lips curled into a smile. "Anyway, their divorce is done.Hannah's moving out just suits you. Things get a whole lot easier for you to grow close to Vincent."


Brinley dropped her gaze with mock shyness and played with a strand of hair, but her tone betrayed her smugness. "You know, Mrs. Jones, there's still plenty of road ahead for me."


Grinning wide, Danica could barely contain her excitement."Won't be long now. I can already picture you as part of the family." A dramatic sigh escaped her lips. "The real tragedy is having to sign away so many properties to Hannah."


An eager glimmer flashed in Brinley's eyes. "I might  be able to help you keep what's yours."


Curiosity sparked immediately across Danica's face."Really? How?" Choosing Brinley as her future daughter-in-law suddenly felt like the best decision she'd ever made.


Later that day, Hannah stopped by Danica's place to collect the property paperwork. Expecting Danica,she ran into Brinley instead.


"Well,look who itBrinley remarked, her voice as sweet as honey but her smile sharp as a knife.


Without a word, Hannah kept moving, clutching her phone and heading straight for the stairs.


Brinley wasn't finished. "At Gilded Restaurant the other day, you heard me and Vincent make out in the private room,didn't you?"


Unfazed, Hannah shot her a glare. "So? Wrecking someone else's marriage-does that really make you proud of yourself?"

 
A flicker of discomfort crossed Brinley's face before she smoothed it over with a fresh smile. "If I hadn't walked away back then, you'd never have had your shot with him." Drawing closer, she lowered her voice. "You want to know what Vincent told me during our encounters? He said you just lie there,stiff as a board, making him do all the work and stripping him of any pleasure from having sex with you."


Without warning, Hannah raised her phone, the screen lit up to show an active call. Her expression turned ice-cold. "Vincent, is that what you really tell your mistress about me?"
###Chapter 7 Moving Into Her NewHome
A storm passed over Brinley's face as her fists tightened at her sides.
With her arms crossed and one eyebrow raised,Hannah gave Brinley a look. "Don't hold back now.Let's hear the rest."

Brinley retorted, "Do you seriously believe any of this will get between Vincent and me?"
With a dismissive laugh, Hannah waved her off."Don't talk like I am interested in winning my husband back. You already slept with him. I don't want him anymore."
Refusing to let the conversation drag on, Hannah made her way upstairs to find Danica.
Brinley's voice rang out from behind, sharp and loaded. "Let me make something clear. The only reason Vincent married you is that he took you as a stand-in during my absence."
Stopping on the landing, Hannah looked back,her tone as steady as ever. "Then let me remind you of something. Vincent is my husband, on paper and in reality. You? You'll never be anything more than his shameless mistress."
With her head held high, Hannah didn't spare another glance as she continued up the steps, every move confident. When she reached Danica, she collected three property deeds and slipped out of the house without saying goodbye.
Vincent arrived barely a minute later, urgency in every step. He rushed into the living room and looked around, only to find no sign of Hannah, the person he wanted to see. "Hannah's left already?" He didn't bother disguising his frustration.

Brinley, eager to stir things up, decided to mention the man she'd seen with Hannah at the Gilded Restaurant. "Yeah, she left. And she wasn't alone.Some guy picked herup."
Vincent's face clouded even more.


The sound of footsteps signaled Danica's descent from upstairs. Seeing her son, she broke into a smile."It's been so long since you came home. Why not stay for dinner tonight? Brinley's here too. Maybe the three of us could catch up like old times."


Vincent shook his head, voice devoid of warmth."I've got work to finish." He glanced over at Brinley."We need to talk. Alone."


Vincent didn't bother looking back as he stepped out of the living room.


Brinley lingered in the doorway, uncertainty shadowing her features before she trailed after him.Her lips parted, ready to speak, but Vincent's voice cut through the tension. "When did I ever sleep with you? Why did you fabricate such things to my wife?"


His tone was grave, eyes locked on her with piercing clarity.


A moment passed before Brinley seemed to crumble.
Tears shimmered in her eyes, sudden and raw, as if he'd laid her soul bare. "Vincent, my feelings for you never disappeared. Watching you and Hannah together-it tore me apart. I blurted out those things because I wanted you to care for me again. Weren't we crazy about each other once?"
She reached out, wrapping her arms around his waist in a desperate embrace. He moved away, breaking her grip. "I am married," he said, steady and unwavering. "Don't say such words again,especially when Hannah's around. The only reason I go out of my way to look after you now is because of your father."

Brinley's voice cracked, desperate. "But Hannah means nothing to you. She's just a stand-in!"
"No," Vincent retorted firmly. "She's my wife."Without another word, he turned his back on her and left.
Silent tears streaked down Brinley's face, but in their wake, a sharp and calculating glimmer appeared. A stand-in had managed to claim everything she believed belonged to her. What did Hannah have that she lacked?


...

Hannah sold off the three properties. A staggering five hundred million hit her bank account without warning.
She started by clearing every outstanding debt and settling all the company's unpaid salaries. After that,she purchased a house in Sterling Heights, the most prestigious and heavily guarded neighborhood in all of Dorbarrow. The people who lived there weren't just wealthy or influential-they were both.
She bought the house to live in by herself and avoid being located by Vincent. Deep down, she doubted he would chase after her anyway. Expecting that much from him felt foolish.

Her first evening behind those guarded gates brought an unexpected twist. Instead of quiet solitude, she brought in a troupe of sharply dressed male escorts-less for their company, more for the show of it.


Each man stood at attention, shirts unbuttoned just enough to reveal hard muscle and practiced confidence. They all understood the art of being admired.


As Hannah lounged with a glass of red wine, she ran her finger along one man's sculpted arm, more curious than captivated.


Even with laughter and music swirling around her, a hollowness pressed in. Her mind, stubborn as ever,wandered back to the one person she shouldn't miss. Vincent's physique wasn't nearly as impressive,but his body had always felt perfect to her. Nothing compared to the memory of tracing his sweat-slicked abs after their most passionate nights-soft,heated,alive beneath her touch. And then, after the heat of the moment, he'd always murmur her nickname "Anna" in that quiet, hungry way, and then pull her close for another round.


Her thoughts were spiraling somewhere they shouldn't be when her phone rang, snapping her out of it. Rena's name flashed on the screen. "Hannah, I just heard-Miles landed today. He came in through the VIP terminal. Want to head to the airport and catch him?"
###Chapter 8 Another Woman Already

Without hesitation, Hannah pushed herself up from the couch. "Send me Miles' flight details. I'll be there in minutes," she said, determination in her eyes as she hung up.
A message pinged onto her phone moments later.According to the message, Miles would be touching down at nine. The clock read eight thirty. Wasting no time, she tossed a bank card to the group of male escorts. "We're done for the evening. Take care of yourselves," she said before waving them out.
Keys in hand, Hannah hurried to the garage and slid into her car, nerves thrumming.
Before she knew it, the airport entrance loomed ahead-barely two minutes to spare before eight thirty.
Crowds packed the VIP terminal, reporters elbowing for space as they waited for a glimpse of Miles.

Hannah kept her distance. Across the sea of cameras and chaos, she spotted a man with his face hidden beneath a cap, flanked by guards. Strangely, Kenneth Adams, Miles's loyal assistant, was nowhere to be found. A hunch told her that wasn't the real Miles out there.


Moving quickly, she made her way down to the parking garage below. Sure enough, the elevator doors slid open to reveal a tall man stepping out, with Kenneth trailing just behind. She called out, her breath still ragged, "Mr. Whitaker, may I have a moment?"


Kenneth immediately stepped forward, shieldng Miles from her approach. "Mr. Whitaker isn't giving interviews tonighnt. You'll have to excuse us."


"I'm not with the press," Hannah replied, shaking her head.



Trying to make herself heard, she peered around Kenneth and addressed the man in the crisp suit, "I represent Nova Tech. I'd like to discuss a partnership  "People keep showing up wanting to strike a business deal with me. Why should I waste time with you?" Miles said coolly, his tone distant. He gazed at her briefly before looking away with a frown. "Can't even manage your own clothes, apparently."


Glancing down, Hannah finally noted that her bra strap was on full display, neckline slipping lower than she realized. She must have tugged it out of place in her rush. In a rush, she straightened her outfit,silently scolding herself, "Perfect. Now he probably thinks I'm throwing myself at himn."


One quick signal from Miles, and Kenneth opened the car door to pull out a tailored jacket, offering it in her direction.


Hannah blinked in surprise. "I... Appreciate it," she said, still catching her breath. A glimmer of opportunity sparked in her eyes. "Would you mind sharing a number? I'll return the jacket to Mr.Whitaker later," she said, hoping for a connection.


"No need for that," Kenneth replied with no warmth at all. "Mr. Whitaker doesn't wear anything once  someone else has touched it."


Switching her focus back to Miles, Hannah tried again, refusing to let the moment slip away. Whitaker, has Nova Tech ever come up in your research? We're pushing Al into women's safety products.I think-"


She took a step forward, attempting to close the gap,but Kenneth positioned himself directly in her path.


Miles slid into the back seat and said nothing more.


Kenneth's eyes narrowed as he gave her a dismissive look, not bothering to hide his irritation. "I've seen your type before. You're lucky Mr. Whitaker's polite-otherwise, you'd be leaving here with nothing but regret." He then hopped into the car.


With a deep growl, the car's engine started up and the luxury sedan disappeared into the night.


Impulse told Hannah to give chase, her feet already moving toward the exit.


Suddenly, the elevator chimed and slid open right  someone else has touched it."


Switching her focus back to Miles, Hannah tried again, refusing to let the moment slip away. Whitaker, has Nova Tech ever come up in your research? We're pushing Al into women's safety products.I think-"


She took a step forward, attempting to close the gap,but Kenneth positioned himself directly in her path.

With a deep growl, the car's engine started up and the luxury sedan disappeared into the night.


Impulse told Hannah to give chase, her feet already moving toward the exit.


Suddenly, the elevator chimed and slid open right beside her. Every muscle tensed as Vincent stepped out, another woman by his side, and Bobby lagging just behind them. A pang of hurt raced through her chest.


Bobby, of course, had been here to connect with Miles, dragging Vincent along to keep up appearances. But with reporters flooding the terminal, their plans had shifted to collecting Miles's sister instead.


Catching sight of Hannah in the garage, Vincent was visibly caught off guard. "What brings you here?" he asked, confusion flickering in his eyes.


Only then did a new thought occur to him-maybe she'd discovered his schedule and come here just to see him. So she still cared.


His lips parted, ready to say more, but Hannah didn't give him the chance. Her words cut the air between them. "Another woman already, Mr. Jones? That was fast."
###Chapter 9 An Accidental Slap
Vincent's brow furrowed. He looked at Hannah,clearly displeased. "Do you have to talk like that?"


Hannah adjusted the jacket draped over her shoulders and raised an eyebrow. "Did I say something wrong?" A smirk curled her lips.ne woman after another-aren't you worried you'll wear yourself out? Would hate for fatigue to be your undoing,Mr.Jones."



The comment sat poorly with Vincent. At what point had Hannah become this sharp-tongued? His eyes lingered on the jacket draped on her shoulder-obviously a man's, and definitely not his own. A wave of suspicion crashed over him. Was she here to see off some man at the airport? Clearing his throat, he asked, "What are you doing at the airport?"



With barely a glance back, Hannah let out a huff and strode away, making it clear she was done with the conversation.



But the next second, Vincent strode forward and grabbed her wrist, "Where do you think you're going?"



"None of your business," Hannah snapped, her words clipped as she tried to twist out of his grasp.But he refused to let go.


"Still making a fuss?" Vincent asked, frustration clear in every word.


A hollow, humorless laugh escaped Hannah. Making a fuss? She hadn't made a scene or harmed anyone -just kept all her pain to herself. Yet, somehow, he viewed her as immature, making a fuss. All at once,the fight in her faded. A heavy silence settled over her.



"I didn't make a fuss," Hannah finally said, her voice level and steady.


Vincent picked up on the change, his own tone softening. "Let's head home. We need to talk this out."



A bitter laugh escaped from Hannah. "Home? That word doesn't mean anything to us. To everyone else,I was never your wife-just a secret lover, right?"


In fact, she wasn't even a lover. She was just a stand-in for Brinley. And for five years, she'd been kept in the dark.


Their eyes met, her gaze heavy with pain,disappointment, and a thousand other feelings that words couldn't touch.



Every bit of her heartbreak was written on her face,and Vincent saw it. The sight nearly closed up his throat.



She turned to leave again, but Vincent gripped her wrist even more tightly. He tugged her back, urging her toward his car.



His strength overpowered her resistance. Rage bubbled up inside her. Her arm flew out,accidentally connecting with his cheek in a sharp, stinging slap.
For a split second, the sound echoed around them.Hannah stood perfectly still, shocked by what she'd just done.

His head slapped to the side, Vincent set his jaw and pressed his tongue to the inside of his cheek. His eyes narrowed, shadows flickering in their depths."Can we talk now?"

Without waiting for an answer, he yanked her to the car and shoved her inside before slamming the door shut and speeding away before she could protest.
Behind them, Daphne Whitaker, Miles' younger sister,watched from the curb, her mouth falling open as the car disappeared. "Who was that woman? Did she really slap Mr. Jones?"
Bobby scoffed. "Just some lover. Not worth mentioning."

Meanwhile, silence hung thick inside the Bentley.Hannah turned her head, watching the outline of Vincent's cheek where her hand had landed. Her heart churned with regret. After all the years they'd spent together, she'd never once struck him-this was the first time.


Only then did Vincent finally release her wrist,his gaze catching on the faint red line his grip had left behind.


Delicate skin had always betrayed Hannah's bruises.Every time they'd been intimate, her body would be dotted with love marks, some lasting for days.


His throat bobbed at the memory. Slowly, he reached over, brushing his thumb over the mark as if he could erase it.



The touch jolted Hannah back to reality. She snatched her hand away. "What exactly do you want to talk to me about?"



Regaining his composure, Vincent answered,"Grandma's seventieth birthday is coming up soon.You haven't forgotten, have you?"


"Of course I remember," she replied. Three weeks-that was all the time left. Once his grandmother's birthday celebration wrapped up, she would vanish from his world entirely and announce their divorce publicly.


Turning away, Hannah fixed her attention on the scenery outside. Her fingers absentmindedly traced the pale impression left by a wedding band that was no longer there.


Again and again, Vincent glanced over at her profile.Each time, a feeling of powerlessness crept in, like she was slipping out of his orboit and there was nothing he could do.


"You've always taken charge of Grandma's birthday plans," he said, his tone softening. "Seventieth birthday is a big milestone. Do you have any ideas for the celebration?"



Hannah said nothing.


Vincent's eyes dimmed slightly, though he tried to mask it. "Maybe we could skip the big party this time.Something simple-a family dinner. I think that would mean a lot to her."
A tired breath slipped from Hannah, her words scraping the air. "You don't have to ask me, Vincent.There's probably someone out there who could do it better."



Vincent's face clouded over in an instant. His eyes locked on hers as he demanded, "And what's that supposed to mean? Are you telling me to divorce you and go marry another woman who handles the celebration?"
###Chapter 10Irritating





"I meant it might be smarter to let a real party planner handle the celebration. I'd probably just mess it up," Hannah explained, her tone flat.


The tension on Vincent's expression eased a little.


Hannah curled her lips into a slight smile and added,"But if you want to divorce me and marry someone else, I won't stand in your way."



Vincent tugged at his tie, a cold smirk spreading across his lips. "You really want me to marry someone else? Are you eager to ditch me?"


While keeping her eyes fixed on the window, Hannah answered with zero hesitation, "Of course. I got tired of seeing your face every day."


Suddenly, Vincent leaned in, his crisp, masculine scent wafting into her nostrils. His voice dropped to a whisper. "So what's wrong with my face, exactly?"
Hannah turned her head, only to find his chiseled features dangerously close. Her lashes fluttered,and her heart thudded in her chest. He'd always been ridiculously handsome. That was why she'd chased after him all those years ago. He never bothered with fancy cologne. Somehow, he always smelled crisp and magnetic, without even trying.


Thick silence pressed between them, heavy as a rainstorm. Vincent eventually made a low humming sound, urging her for an answer.


Without missing a beat, Hannah reached up and nudged his face aside. "Even the best-looking guy starts to look the same after seeing every single day for a while."


A shadow passed over Vincent's face, the mood in the car sinking a few degrees. "You really want to get on my nerves, don't you?"


Her lips curled into a half-smile. "I'm just saying what's on my mind. You're way better at irritating people than Iam."
No one spoke for a few seconds, and the atmosphere was thick enough to cut. Up front, Derek Barrett,Vincent's assistant, shrank back in his seat,wishing he could disappear altogether.


Out of nowhere, Vincent circled back. "Grandma's turning seventy. The birthday party is your responsibility."


Hannah's first instinct was to refuse. They were getting divorced-keeping their distance would be best.



As she started to voice her refusal, Vincent jumped in first. "She adores you. You really want to let her down?"



The words hit like a brick. From the moment Hannah married into the Jones family, Sharon had always offered the gentlest welcome. Whenever Danica's words stung or Vincent seemed to vanish from her world, it was Sharon who stood by her side.


Lately, Sharon's strength was fading, age catching up with her in small,quiet ways. Hannah had always
intended to wait until this birthday passed before bringing up the divorce. Most likely, this would be their last celebration together. So why was she still second-guessing herself?


A breath escaped her lips as she answered, "Fine.I'll do it."


Relief softened Vincent's sharp features. "That settles it. Starting now, we'll move back to the Jones family house. Everything you need will be there."


"Okay," Hannah replied, her voice flat as stone.


With a sidelong glance, Vincent studied her profile,something unshakable gnawing at his chest.


The rest of the ride passed in silence as the Bentley cruised toward the Jones family estate.


A solitary figure stood by the iron gates,waiting with apparent purpose.


Catching sight of Brinley through the car window,Hannah's heart dropped. She turned to Vincent, her words clipped and cold. "You should have mentioned
Brinley was here."


He picked up on her irritation right away and rushed to calm the moment."She won't be around long. It's only temporary."


A nod was all he received. Hannah wasted no energy arguing as she stepped out of the car. Last time she and Brinley spoke, things had turned sour fast. But this was the Jones house. Danica and Vincent had agreed to let Brinley stay, and her feelings on the matter meant nothing here. Planning the birthday was her only reason for being back. Whether Brinley left or stayed changed nothing about that.


Brinley's expression flickered when she saw Hannah."What are you doing here?"


Hannah let out a dry, derisive laugh. "Miss Gilbert,you've been living here so long that you almost believe you're the lady of the manor? That question should be coming from me-Vincent's actual wvife."
###Chapter 11 Find Out Who Owns ThisJacket
Something hard flickered in Brinley's eyes, but the moment she noticed Vincent drawing near, a wounded expression replaced it. "Hannah, I was just asking. I didn't mean anything by it."


Hannah stepped forward, her tone bright with sarcasm."Oh, I was just giving you a heads-up.Nothing more."


Sharp-tongued and unbothered, Hannah left Brinley no room to fight back.


Nerves got the better of Brinley as she balled her hands into fists. But glancing at Vincent, she pasted on a sugary smile and slipped her arm through his."Vincent, you must be exhausted."


An uninterested glance from Hannah caught the scene, but she kept walking, ignoring them both.
Vincent gently untangled himself from Brinley's grasp. "GGo on ahead. I have something to discuss with Derek."



For a split second, Brinley hesitated. "Alright," she said, disappointment coloring her features as she turned away.


Right then, Derek hurried over from the car, holding a suit jacket. "Mr. Jones,your wife accidentally left this behind."



Shadowed eyes fixed on the jacket, Vincent's voice dropped. "Check who owns this jacket."


Uncertainty crept into Derek's question. "Alright.Should I return it to Mrs. Jones?"


"Get rid of it," Vincent said,his tone ice-cold.


Derek didn't dare argue. He nodded and left without another word.



Inside, the dining room was already set with dishes that smelled freshly made.
At the sound of approaching footsteps, Danica spun around with a bright greeting-her smile freezing instantly as she spotted Hannah. "Why are you back?" The warmth vanished.


A raised eyebrow from Hannah made her intentions clear."Am I not allowed to return here? Until I hand over the divorce papers, I still belong to this family.So I'll come and go as I please."


A shadow clouded Danica's face. "You've split from Vincent already. If you had any sense, you'd keep your distance. Why stick around-what's your real motive?"


Hannah let a brittle laugh fill the room."Oh, I see.The real problem is me ruining the happy little scene between Brinley and Vincent."


For once, Danica stayed silent, which said enough.


An edge crept into Hannah's smile. "Isn't it funny?You're so eager to see me out, but you haven't even handed over the properties you promised. Is this how you make good on your deals, Danica?"
"You keep acting like I'm dragging my feet. I told you it wasn't going to happen overnight. I gave you my word.What, do you really believe I'd hesitate over a handful of houses?" Danica's voice shot up as she got emotional.


At that moment, Vincent entered and caught the last part of the exchange. A frown creased his brow."What houses?"



Not bothering to spare him a look, Hannah simply lifted an eyebrow at Danica, a hint of amusement in her eyes. "Yeah, what houses?"


Covering quickly, Danica waved off the question."Oh, it's nothing at all. Hannah was just interested in one of my properties. Isn't that right, Hannah?"


A sharp glance from Danica served as a silent warning.





Shrugging, Hannah gave her a cold, mocking smile."Whatever you say."


Choosing the seat beside Hannah, Vincent loosened his collar and settled in. "Mom's properties aren't half bad. Are you planning on living in one, or is this about investment?"


Hannah shot him a suspicious look. "Why does it matter to you?"


With a businesslike tone, Vincent replied, "I could help you make the right call." Years of experience had taught him how to spot a good deal. Every part of the Jones Group had flourished under his watch.


Hannah paused for a second and then said nothing.


While the conversation continued, Brinley remained off to the side, ignored and out of place. Fingernails biting into her palm, she kept her features smooth and pleasant. "Mrs. Jones, now that Vincent's back,why don't we all eat?"


Jumping in to smooth things over, Danica added,"Brinley put together the whole meal and wouldn't touch a single dish until you arrived, Vincent.She's always so  With a small, demure smile, Brinley ducked her head."Mrs. Jones, you give me too much credit."


Brinley ladled soup into Vincent's bowl and placed it in front of him.



Looking around the table, Hannah asked, "Where's Sharon? Isn't she eating with us?"


Danica answered lightly, not missing a beat, "She's getting on in years and turned in early. Had some porridge and went straight to bed."


While talking, Danica continued to pile food onto Vincent's plate. "Here, have some more."


Watching Vincent closely, Brinley waited for his reaction. "Vincent, do you like the meal? I tried a new recipe."


Without much interest, Vincent barely touched the food before putting down his utensils. The soup went untouched. "There's no need for you to cook or serve me," he said, his voice indifferent. "Wehave plenty of staff for that."considerate."
###Chapter 12 Played As The Assistant
Danica totally misinterpreted Vincent's polite refusal as concern for Brinley. With a nudge and a cheerful grin, she turned to Brinley. "See? What did I say?Vincent only wants to make sure you aren't wearing yourself out."


This drew a bright smile from Brinley. "It's no burden at all, Vincent. I actually like doing these little things for you."


Meanwhile, Hannah toyed with her fork, her appetite gone in an instant.


Her reaction didn't escape Vincent's notice, but just as he was about to speak up, Danica beat him to it."Sharon's 70th birthday is coming up fast. I've decided to let Brinley take the lead with the planning this time." Her tone sparkled, as if she had just shared a fabulous surprise.



In Danica's mind, Hannah and Vincent's upcoming divorce meant Sharon's birthday planning was the perfect chance to let Brinley shine. A flawless event would give her an excuse to announce Brinley as her chosen daughter-in-law and set everything in motion for the future.


Confidence radiated from Brinley as she nodded."Thank you, Mrs. Jones. I'll make sure Sharon has a birthday she'll remember for the rest of her life."


Turning to Vincent, Hannah's face was shadowed."Well, since you've already picked somneone else for the job, why bother asking me?"


"I didn't know until just now," Vincent said, frowning slightly. He turned to Danica. "Hannah's handled this every year,and-"


Cutting him off with a dismissive wave, Danica pushed her point. "She's organized it enough times.Skipping one party isn't the end of the world. We need a change."


Calm and steady, Vincent replied, "It's still Grandma's birthday. Her granddaughter-in-law should handle it."


Danica held her position. "Brinley practically grew up under Sharon's roof. She knows what the family likes.Why shouldn't she take care of the birthday planning?"


With a soft, self-effacing smile, Brinley looked down."Mrs. Jones, perhaps we should let Hannah handle it.I probably am overstepping. After all, I'm just an outsider. Hannah's much better suited for this."


It was a calculated retreat to win support, and Brinley played her part to perfection. Hannah saw through her charade in an instant.


A single glance from Hannah carried all the cold contempt she felt. "That's correct. You're just an outsider, and I am more suited."


With her lips pressed tight, Brinley lowered her eyes,pretending to be wounded.


Danica wasted no time jumping to Brinley's defense."Vincent, can't you see how upset Brinley is?"
A note of regret crept into Vincent voice."That's not what I meant at all."
Never one to give up,Danica pressed her case "Let's compromise. Brinley wvill lead the planning,and Hannah can step in as her assistant.Does that sound fair?"
"That sounds perfect," Brinley chimed in immediately. "I'd love to learn from Hannah."
A sharp laugh escaped Hannah. "Absolutely not.Why should I take orders from her?"
Softening her voice, Brinley tried to appeal to the room."I've been abroad all these  years.Sharon's  always been kind to me. Now that  I'm back,  I just want to do something nice for her. Hannah,it's just a  celebration-does it really matter who's running it?"
No sign of yielding appeared on Hannah's face."Either I take charge or I'm out.if you want the spotlight,then own it. If not, don't bother

Eyes wet and pleading, Brinley turned to Vincent.allI want is to make Sharon happy. Could you please talk to Hannah for my sak<e?"


Several long seconds passed before Vincent gave his verdict."We'll go with Mom's suggestion."


Hannah snapped,"Excuse me?"


Unruffled, Vincent explained, "This may be Brinley's only opportunity. You'll have more chances in the future."


Expression dull, Hannah responded, "I am not on board." They would soon be divorced, and she didn't have any more chances. By then, as an ex-wife, her place in this household would be next to nothing.


Vincent closed the discussion. "It's settled."
###Chapter 13 Still Have The Nerve ToCling To Him
"If you refuse to play as the assistant, then that's the end of it," Vincent said, his tone firm. "Brinley will take charge of the entre birthday banquet on her own."



Excitement flickered in Brinley's gaze, a spark she barely managed to hide.


A cold laugh tumbled from Hannah's lips. "Vincent,you're the one who'd dragged me all the way back.And now this? Am I supposed to just let you walk all over me?" She regretted it-regretted letting her guard down and believing him for evena second.


With a tired sigh, Vincent pressed his fingers to his temples. "That isn't what I mean. You said no to assist Brinley, so now you don't have to."


Disbelief hovered around Hannah as she let out a scoff. Truthfully, she didn't trust Brinley with the entire banquet. Something in her gut warned that the party could turn into a mess if Brinley managed it.Letting Sharon's birthday be ruined was out of the question.


In the end, Hannah relented. "Fine. I'll take the assistant's role."


Disappointment weighed heavily in her tone, and Vincent noticed right away. Words hovered on his lips, but Brinley was faster. "Thank you, Vincent.Everything will be perfect. Sharon will have the best celebration she's ever had-I promise."


Victory shone in Brinley's eyes. Despite Vincent's harsh tone the last time they talked alone, it was clear he was still on her side. That was all she needed to outplay Hannah.


Watching from her seat, Danica looked absolutely pleased to see her son taking Brinley's side.


Hannah,choosing silence, left the table and headed straight to her room. After this exchange, she'd lost her appetite. Locked away in her room, a tidal wave of feelings swept through her, every one of them tracing back to Vincent.


A sudden knock broke the silence. One of the housekeepers stood outside her door. "Mrs. Jones,Mr. Jones noticed you barely touched your food and asked me to bring you some dessert."


"Just set it down," Hannah replied, not bothering to glance up. This was so typical of Vincent-hurting her first and patching things up later with shallow gestures. As if a sweet treat could erase the sting of his actions. As if she could be bought with a few kind crumbs. Honestly, maybe she'd given in too many times. The more he disappointed her, the more she found herself growing numb. Only the occasional,hollow ache in her chest reminded her that she could still feel at all.



Meanwhile, downstairs, Danica couldn't hide her displeasure at Hannah's habit of holing up in her room after dinner, avoiding any household responsibilities.
Predictably, Brinley leapt at the chance of playing as a messenger and volunteered to fetch Hannah.


As fate would have it, Hannah emerged from her room for a glass of water just as Brinley made her way up the stairs.


Without a word, Hannah passed by, her glass in tow,her expression as cold as the marble beneath her feet.


"Hannah," Brinley remarked, unwilling to let her go.


Choosing not to react, Hannah continued down the stairs, determined to ignore her.


A quick sidestep put Brinley in Hannah's path.


"What is it?" Hannah asked, irritation sharpening her words.


"I only meant to say this-I was just as surprised when Vincent defended me. You went out of your way to turn him against me, and still, nothing between him and me has shifted at all." Brinley smiled, her expression dripping with smug  satisfaction.


"Yeah, he cares a lot for you," Hannah said, her laugh empty. "Is that what you wanted to hear all along?"


Not waiting for a response, Hannah pivoted to walk away.


Once again, Brinley stepped in, blocking the stairs."Don't you find yourself pathetic? Not a single person at the dinner table stood up for you. Everyone sided with me. And yet, you still have the nerve to cling to Vincent?" Triumph sparkled in her eyes.


A chilly laugh escaped Hannah. "Pathetic or not, I'm still Vincent's legal wife."


Mockery curled Brinley's lips. "Doesn't matter.You're just a stand-in during my absence. He never loved you."


Those words stung, but Hannah met her gaze and forced a smile. "Even so, until I walk away, you'll always be the shameless mistress."


Contempt flickered in Brinley's tone. "You already know he sees you as my substitute, and you're still holding on to that title? Have you no shame,Hannah?"
With a shrug, Hannah retorted, "At least I'm not the shameless one scheming to wreck someone else's marriage."
Anger flared in Brinley's eyes. "I dare you say that again!"
Enraged, Brinley gave Hannah a violent shove,sending Hannah stumbling down the staircase.
Hannah landed hard, the water glass slipping from her grasp and exploding into shards across the tiles.An attempt to stand only made things worse. Her palm pressed into the broken glass, and pain shot through her hand like electricity.
Footsteps echoed above. In a flash, Brinley scrambled down the stairs and threw herself to the floor, clutching her arm and twisting her face into an agonized mask.
Meanwhile, Vincent had just finished a round of work in his study. The sudden commotion drew him out. At the sight of both women crumpled at the base of the stairs, his expression went from confusion to alarm."What happened here?"
 ###Chapter 14 He Didn't Notice HerInjuries

Broken glass sparkled across the polished floor,glinting in the light.


Vincent arrived at the scene in seconds, dropping to Brinley's side and helping her up without hesitation.A grimace flickered on his face as he noticed her hand, bloody and riddled wvith shards.


That moment of concern for Brinley wasn't lost on Hannah. Something heavy and cold settled deep inside her. Pushing through the pain, she pulled herself to her feet unaided.



"Can someone explain what happened?" Vincent's gaze swept to Hannah for answers.



Barely had Hannah opened her mouth when Brinley jumped in, her voice trembling, "It all happened so fast. I think Hannah pushed me, and suddenly I was falling down the stairs. The next thing I knew, she was tumbling too."


Frowning at Hannah, Vincent questioned,"Did you really push her?"


Brinley gave a weak laugh and chose her words carefully toshift Vincent's focus. "I can't say for sure why she did it. Maybe she's upset about having to assist me with the party planning, but I won't hold it against her. It's just a scratch, Vincent. Don't worry about me."



A bitter smile crossed Hannah's lips. "Bravo, Miss Gilbert. That's some impressive acting." She looked Vincent dead in the eyes, her voice cutting. "But let's get this straight. I didn't lay a finger on her. lf anyone's lying here, it's her. She pushed me down the staircase. Just look at her. She's not hurt at all."


Despair crept in, chilling Hannah to the core. She already knew where Vincent's trust lay.


Vincent showed Brinley's wounded palm to Hannah."She's not exactly fine."
But Hannah's hand was injured too-and Vincent hadn't even noticed.



Bitterness consumed Hannah. No question remained -Vincent didn't seem to care about her, his"stand-in," at all. Brinley had his full attention, as always.


A sharp, humorless laugh escaped Hannah. "You should probably rush her to the emergency room before her minor scratch heals."



Her sarcasm irritated Vincent. He was just trying to get the truth, and his tone might be sharper than intended. "Can't you just talk normally?"


Hannah answered coldly, "Don't feel like so."


Tension thickened the air, neither willing to yield.


Sniffles from Brinley filled the silence. "Why do you hate me so much, Hannah?"


Hannah frowned at the sound. Even with blood running down her own hand, somehow, she'd become the villain, baseless accusations thrown her way. Any urge to put up with it vanished. Her unharmed hand whipped up, landing a slap across Brinley's cheek with a crack that left no room for confusion.


Hannah spat, "If I wanted to hurt you, Brinley, you'd know it. I don't waste time with games."


Another slap was ready, but Vincent caught her wrist mid-swing. "That's enough, Hannah."


Hannah yanked her arm away and let out a bitter laugh. "So, you couldn't bear to see her hurt by me,right? And you're still taking her side, Vincent? I'm your wife."


Vincent's expression tightened as his brow drew together. "Being my wife doesn't give you the right to bully others like this."


"You think I'm bullying her?" Hannah scoffed,a bitter laugh about to escape but failed.


Brinley quickly stepped in to ease the tension just to make her look good. "Vincent, please don't be upset.Hannah probably just lost control for a moment. Take me to get my hand treated, okay?"


Vincent's sharp features softened a bit."Alright."


Brinley even glanced over at Hannah, sticking to her considerate persona. "Maybe Hannah needs a hospital trip too?"


Vincent dismissed the idea immediately. "NNo.Let her cool off for a bit."


All the noise soon drew Danica over, her voice sharp with irritation. "What is it this time, Hannah? All this fuss just because you didn't want to do a little housework?"


Her gaze shifted, shock freezing her expression as she spotted Brinley's bleeding hand. "Oh my! Brinley,your hand!"


With a gentle smile, Brinley made a feigned attempt to downplay it. "Really, it's nothing."


"Nothing? That could leave a scar! Vincent, what are you waiting for? Get her to the emergency room-now!"
Vincent didn't hesitate. "We're leaving."


Brinley reached out, expecting Vincent to carry her.


But Vincent simply brushed past her and asked lightly, "Did you hurt your leg?"


"N-no, just my hand..." Quick to follow, Brinley trailed after him, shooting a smug, victorious glance at Hannah before disappearing.


Still rooted to the spot, Hannah felt her heart drop lower than ever. Laughter, dry and hollow, escaped her lips. Of course. First loves would always matter more than a stand-in like her. Barely above a whisper,she spoke to the empty hallway. "Vincent, we're finished.Totally."

###Chapter 15 You Almost Pushed Her
Over The Edge

As soon as Vincent and Brinley headed out for the hospital, Danica marched straight over to Hannah,her anger barely contained.
"You actually wanted Brinley gone, didn't you?"Danica questioned, shoving her finger closeto Hannah's face. "I can't believe it took me this long to see just how cruel you are."
Hannah didn't bother to offer any defense. "That figures. People from your family never bother to think before acting or throwing accusations."
Turning her back, Hannah made her way upstairs to get her phone.
Danica's attention was finally drawn to the steady stream of blood running down Hannah's right hand.
"Your hand is bleeding that badly, and you're just going to ignore it? You really think pulling a stunt like this will make Vincent care about you more?" Danica yelled up the stairs.


There was no reply from Hannah. She climbed each step slowly, as if she couldn't hear a word.


Her vision was a little hazy as the earlier scene replayed in her mind. Vincent brought every single word Brinley had uttered without a hint of doubt while dismissing her explanation outright. They had been together for five years as husband and wife.Yet, that still meant nothing compared to a single tear from his first love. What was the point of everything she'd done over the years? All of it just felt like a cruel joke.



Hannah pulled out her phone and called Rena, asking her for a ride to the hospital.


Meanwhile, on the journey to the hospital, Vincent sat up front beside the driver. Brinley was seated in the back.



A deep frown stayed etched on Vincent's face, and the tension refused to leave his brow. Hannah's stubborn face kept flashing through his mind,refusing to fade. He spoke in a clipped tone to Derek."Take us to the hospital. After that, go back and get Hannah. Make sure she's treated."



"Understood," Derek replied.


Brinley's gaze darted toward Vincent as she leaned a bit closer. "Vincent, I'm sure Hannah is alright. Try not to worry."


"Hope so," he replied curtly.


Brinley wanted to say more, but Vincent clearly wasn't in the mood for conversation. He answered her enthusiasm with short, blunt replies.


Once at the hospital, Brinley's tests showed no alarming issues. The only concern was the cuts on her hand from the shattered glass.



While her hand was being treated, she kept trying to lean into Vincent for comfort, but he always managed to shift away from her touch. After a while, he made an excuse to leave and walked out into the corridor.


Vincent stood alone in the hallway, still piecing his thoughts together, when his phone buzzed. Derek was calling. "Mr. Jones, Miss Brown has already taken your wife to the hospital."


"Alright," Vincent replied.


"Actually..." Derek hesitated, unsure whether to speak up.



Vincent's reply was cold. "Is there something else?"


"I saw blood all over the staircase, and it seems to be your wife's," Derek finally said, hesitating no more.Even though Brinley seemed to be the one Vincent favored these days, he still believed Vincent couldn't just turn his back on his wife.


A tightness formed in Vincent's throat. "Do you know which hospital she's in?"


"P'Il check right-"


Suddenly,someone rushed past Vincent. He glanced up and saw it was Rena.


"There's no need." Vincent ended the call and quickly caught up to Rena. "Tell me where Hannah is."


Rena spun around to face him, her anger flaring instantly. "You have some nerve showing concern now. I should be the one demanding answers-what exactly did you do to Hannah?" Her words came out shaky with rage. "Vincent, you made a promise to look after Hannah. And nowN look at her. You almost pushed her over the edge!"



Earlier, once rushing over to the Jones family estate,Rena had been greeted by the sight of Hannah slumping near the gates. There was no life in Hannah's eyes, and her face had turned ashen,as if the world had broken her.


To Rena, Hannah had looked like she was hanging on by a thread. However, even in that state, Hannah had forced a faint smile and insisted she was alright. But how could she possibly be fine?
Turning away, Rena made it clear she did not want to say another word to Vincent.


Vincent's expression grew grim. "What do you mean by that? Where is she right now?"
###Chapter 16 Stayed In Her Ward
Mockery laced every word as Rena replied,,SO the famous CEO of the Jones Group suddenly can't understand simple words? Now you're worried about Hannah? Too late. Why don't you just return and look after your darling childhood love?"


After delivering that jab, Rena headed toward Hannah's hospital room.


Vincent trailed right behind her despite her attempt to shake him off.


Once Rena entered Hannah's ward, Vincent stepped forward from behind Rena and approached Hannah's bedside.


A shrug accompanied Rena's words. "Sorry, Hannah.Couldn't lose him."


A blank look settled on Hannah's face while she said indifferently, "Mr. Jones, what do you want from me now? Demanding me to pay your mistress's hospital expenses?"



"Can't we have a normal conversation?" Vincent's gaze shifted to Hannah's right hand, now wrapped in white gauze. He distinctly remembered it had been fine earlier. "What did the doctor say?"


Her reply was flat and cold. "That doesn't concern you." Every bit of pain came rushing back as she thought about how the glass shard-almost as big as her thumb-had been pulled from her hand. Enduring that made her believe she could face anything.


Vincent took a step forward and sat beside her bed."What really happened back there?"


"It doesn't matter anymore," Hannah said, her voice devoid of emotion.



Vincent added, "I just wanted to know the truth."


Instead of answering, Hannah closed her eyes,shutting him down completely. Aside from the glance she had cast his way the moment he entered, she hadn't spared him a look since. She was truly mad at him.


At that moment, a nurse stepped inside. "Ma'am,how is your head? Does the concussion still trouble you?"


Hannah shook her head and answered, "I'm much better.Thank you."


The nurse replaced her IV bag with practiced hands."You'll need these fluids through the night. It's best if someone stays here with you."


Vincent gave a courteous reply. "I understand. Thank you."


Rena waved him off. "Go keep your precious Brinley company. I'll stay here and look after Hannah."


In a steady voice, Vincent replied, "I'll stay. There's no need for you to trouble yourself, Miss Brown."


Rena's eyes narrowed. "Really? I was the one who'd picked Hannah up and rushed her to the hospital.Where were you while she needed you the most?"
Vincent had no answer for that.



Rena looked like she wanted to continue, but Vincent pressed his finger to his lips and softly said, "She's asleep now."


A heavy silence filled the room.


Not long after, Rena's phone rang, and she excused herself. Vincent nodded, walking her to the door.


At the same time, Brinley had been looking everywhere for Vincent after her hand was bandaged. She'd already asked Derek and learned Vincent had not gone home. He was still somewhere in the hospital.


All at once, Brinley caught sight of Vincent leaving a ward with a woman right behind. As soon as that woman walked away, Vincent turned around and reentered the ward.


Brinley made her way over, only to discover Hannah lying in the hospital bed. A mix of anger and disbelief twisted her features. That annoying Hannah really was everywhere.


Burning with irritation, Brinley headed back to the ER and complained about feeling dizzy. A nurse guided her to a ward to rest. She even requested an IV, so the nurse hooked her up to a glucose drip.



...


Vincent never left Hannah's side the entire night.


By the time morning arrived and Hannah finally woke up, her eyes immediately landed on him. He was sitting by her bed, head leaned back and eyes shut as if he had fallen asleep. Even while slumped in the chair, he still managed to look dignified and in control.


As soon as he sensed her gaze, he opened his eyes and spoke in a low voice. "Staring at me first thing after waking up?"


She looked at him and asked, "You weren't really sleeping?"


He replied, "No. I just had my eyes closed for a bit."
The way he said it left her unsure-had he been awake the whole night, or had he only managed to close his eyes just now? But she didn't care enough to find out.



Right then, her phone vibrated with a new message from Brinley. "Believe it or not-just one text from me and Vincent will come running to me."
###Chapter 17 The Patient In Bed 32 lsMy Wife

Hannah didn't bother to reply to Brinley's message.

A little later, Vincent checked his phone and spoke to Hannah. "I need to leave for a bit. The last IV should be finished in about thirty minutes."


Hannah answered with a simple, "Okay." Not once did she look up, her attention fixed on her phone.Just as she had predicted, a single message from Brinley was all it took for Vincent to walk out the door.


Pretending that it did not hurt would be a lie.Countless times before, she had called him, only to be told he was too busy. Always too busy to spare time for her. When it came to his first love,though,he dropped everything without hesitation.


A wave of heartache swept over Hannah, but she swiftly pushed it aside and opened up her company's analytics dashboard. It became clear that the steady decline of her business was not only because their products lacked fresh ideas. Problems with staff played a major part, too. Restructuring the team had to come first.



While she was sorting through this, a bouquet came into view. She lifted her gaze and found Felix standing there, holding the flowers.


"Rena mentioned you were in the hospital. Are you feeling better?" he asked.


She answered softly, "I'm fine."


As luck would have it, there were plenty of things she wanted to discuss with him.


Felix set up his laptop, and both of them immediately shifted into work mode.







Elsewhere, inside Brinley's room, Vincent had just taken a seat when a nurse entered to remove the IV.
A suspicious look crossed the nurse's face as she recognized him. "Aren't you the one who stayed all night with the patient in bed thirty-two? What are you doing here?"


She let her gaze flick from Brinley to Vincent. She looked at him like he was some kind of real-life Casanova. A sharp click of her tongue showed exactly what she thought.


Vincent kept his voice level. "The patient in bed 32 is my wife." He pointed toward Brinley. "This is just an acquaintance."


The nurse's whole demeanor changed right away."Oh, that clears things up. Yeah, I could tell you weren't that kind of man. All night, you've stayed with your wife and checked on her. I noticed it all.You seemed so loyal, not like someone sneaking around."



Brinley's stomach churned. She had refused to look for Vincent last night, assuming he would come to her on his own. He never did, not even bothering to text her. It was only after she messaged him, saying  her condition had worsened and she needed IV fluids, that he finally came by.


Brinley could tell Vincent harbored feelings toward Hannah.And she hated it.


As soon as the nurse left, Vincent looked at Brinley and spoke in a measured tone. "I already know what happened last night.Hannah didn't push you."


Though his voice stayed calm, the coldness in his eyes made Brinley's skin prickle. Color drained from her cheeks. "Vincent, was that what Hannah told you? Did she say I pushed her? Don't believe just what she says-she's twisting everything!"


Vincent responded, his tone cool and even, "Then tell me your version.What really happened?"


Brinley insisted, her voice growing shrill, "She pushed me first! Then, she pretended to fall after me..."



Vincent cut her off. "Brinley." He stood up,disappointment etched on his face. "Hannah never accused you of anything. I checked with the doctor about your injuries myself."


For a moment, Brinley could not move. Did Vincent already know the truth? No. She couldn't admit her own doing. That would ruin her image in his heart.Forcing herself to tear up, she choked out, "Vincent,do you really think I'm lying? What if Hannah bribed the doctor to frame me-made it look like I wasn't hurt when I actually was?"


Vincent remarked coldly, "She did not even know which room you were in. How could she possibly set you up?"
###Chapter 18 Caught Her With AnotherMan Again
Upon hearing Vincent's words, Brinley fell silent.


Vincent added, "You should feel lucky that Hannah is alright. If things had turned out worse, you wouldn't be getting off so easily."


Ever since Brinley's father, Charles Gilbert, passed away because of Vincent, Vincent had gone out of his way to treat Brinley kindly-she was Charles's only child.


Now with the tension rising, Brinley had no choice but to feign discomfort, pressing her hand to her chest and claiming she was having heart palpitations.Then, she closed her eyes, pretending to have passed out. Facing the truth, especially coming from Vincent, was more than she could stand.


Without hesitating, Vincent called for a doctor before stepping out. Brinley needed time to reflect.






Meanwhile, in Hannah's room, Felix noticed her IV was almost empty and pressed the button to call a nurse.



A nurse entered and stopped short when she spotted a strange man sitting next to Hannah. She gazed at Hannah. "And who might this gentleman be? Your husband is still over there with his acquaintance."


Hannah knew Vincent was with Brinley. A calm reply came from her. "He's actually my ex-husband."


Surprise flickered in the nurse's eyes. "Wait-so everything here is that complicated?"


Hannah answered with a quiet smile, not bothering to explain.


Once the IV was out, Felix put away his laptop and offered to drive Hannah home.



But they'd been deep in discussion, and Hannah wasn't ready to return home just yet. A new idea crossed her mind. "How about we continue talking at a café instead?"



Felix grinned. "That works for me. But you just spent the night on fluids-are you even allowed to have coffee?"


"| feel brand new now. That IV must have been some kind of miracle cure."


Felix could not help but laugh at her dry humor.Together, the two left the hospital and headed to the cafe.


Meanwhile, Vincent walked back into Hannah's hospital room, only to discover the bed was empty.He started asking staff about her whereabouts and soon heard that she had left with another man right after her IV finished. A stormy look crossed his face.His fingers traced the wedding band on his hand as his mind drifted.



Later, when Derek came to pick Vincent up, Vincent was alone. Neither Brinley nor Hannah joined him.
 Vincent's foul mood was impossible to miss.


That afternoon, Vincent barked at several team members over a contract issue, putting everyone at the office on edge. No one knew what had set him off.



Several staff members slipped out to a nearby caféto complain. None of them expected to run right into Vincent's "lover," Hannah. To make things even more interesting, they saw her with another man,something they could gossip about for days.


A few quick photos were snapped before they quickly fled the scene. The office group chat was soon buzzing with updates.


"Looks like the boss's lover has moved on to someone new!"


"Wait, what? So he's the one who got dumped?"


Clive Monroe, the head secretary, jumped in with confidence. "No chance. Everyone knows Hannah's the one who got tossed aside. His first love came back,that's the story."


Clive had recently talked with Brinley. From what he had noticed, Vincent spared no effort in treating her well. Only a few days ago, Vincent had instructed him to pick out a purple gemstone necklace. He made sure to send the photo of it to Brinley right away. It came as no surprise when she wore it the very next day. Clearly, he had chosen the right person to suck up to.


If Clive had to make a prediction, he would say Brinley would be joining the company soon, followed by some big announcement about their engagement.It was plain to see-Vincent intended to marry Brinley.


Lost in his own theories, Clive failed to notice Vincent had walked up right behind him.


In his distraction, Clive had forgotten to deliver the revised contract documents. Even though Vincent had called and texted, Clive hadn't answered once,prompting Vincent to come and check the situation. Now, as Vincent glanced at the group chat history on Clive's phone, he spotted a photo of Hannah sitting with another man. His tone dropped to a low, cold register. "Where was this taken?"


Clive jumped, startled. "It was at Chance Café."


Without showing much emotion, Vincent smoothed the cuff of his shirt. "If the contract revision isn't finished before the day ends, everyone loses their monthly bonus."


Groans spread across the office.


When Vincent got into the car, he instructed Derek,"Drive to Chance Café."



At the same time, Clive hesitated and then sent Brinley a heads-up.
###Chapter 19 My Wife Doesn't Need ToWork
"You want coffee? No need for you to get it yourself -I can go. Still want your usual iced Americano?"Derek asked, always tuned in to Vincent's preferences.


"No coffee today," Vincent muttered, eyes fixed on the view outside. His mood was anything but calm."Just drive to Chance Café."



"Understood."


About five minutes later, they pulled up to Chance Café. Vincent wasted no time striding inside. Inside,Hannah had her hair tied up, showing off the smooth lines of her face. Her features were soft, her energy unmistakable. Her eyes had a doe-like brightness,and she nibbled on her lip when she thought. The man seated next to her gazed at her with a soft expression.
Vincent's jaw clenched. As a man, he knew exactly what that look meant-that guy harbored feelings toward Hannah. And to make matters worse, it was the same man who had taken Hannah home the other night. Twice now. She had been with that guy twice.



Meanwhile, at the table, Hannah and Felix were locked in animated discussion.



Hannah had just uncovered a key issue-Nova Tech's procurement manager had been pocketing kickbacks for years, which explained why their materials had been so substandard.



"The procurement manager needs to be removed,"Hannah said without hesitation.



Felix hesitated. "He's been part of the company for a long time."


"He'll get a proper severance," she said firmly. "Or he can be reassigned to a non-critical role."


Felix leaned forward slightly.
thinking of returning to the company?"


"In a day or two," she responded.


He gently slid a plate of pastries in her direction. "Eat something first."


"I'm not that hungry," Hannah said, resting her chin on one hand while scanning the computer screen."Once we streamline the team,we can finally focus on developing new products."


Felix nodded in agreement. "Exactly. With a clear brand identity, we'll have no trouble connecting with the female market."



Feeling encouraged, Hannah reached out and grabbed a pastry. A small dollop of whipped cream ended up on the tip of her nose.


Felix thought the sight was irresistibly cute. He picked up a napkin and paused, debating whether to hand it to her or wipe it himself. After a moment, he chose the bolder option and reached out.


Before he could touch her, a tall figure appeared,
blocking his hand midair.

Hannah's eyes widened when she looked up and saw Vincent standing there. "What are you doing here?"


Vincent replied curtly, "Stopped by to grab coffee.Saw you by coincidence."


Yeah, right. Hannah knew better-since when had Vincent ever fetched his own coffee?


Vincent pulled out a chair and sat between the two of them. He turned to Hannah. "Second time I've met this gentleman, and still no introduction?"

"Felix Wade," Hannah said flatly. "Vincent Jones."


The two men gave each other a nod, both keeping their expressions carefully neutral.


"So, what line of work are you in, Mr. Wade?" Vincent asked with a laid-back tone.


"I run a small business," Felix replied, his voice steady.


Vincent leaned in slightly. "How small are we talking?"


Felix brought his cup to his lips. "Around twenty employees."


A slight arch of Vincent's brow followed. "That's definitely on the small side."


Hannah shot Vincent a look. "Are you doing a background check? What's with all the questions?"

"Just chatting. But if it bothers you, I'll stop," Vincent replied smoothly, flashing a calm smile at her.what were you two talking about?"


Felix answered before she could, "Nothing serious.Just some work stuff."


"Work? Since when does my wife need to work?"Vincent smirked.


Vincent kept his tone light, but each word struck Hannah like a slap-sharp and dismissive. So, that was what he really thought of her. After five years of marriage and everything she had given up just to be a housewife behind closed doors for him, this was all she got from him-mockery dressed as casual conversation.


A flicker of anger crossed Felix's face. "Sounds like being married to you isn't exactly the dream people assume it is."



Vincent's brow tightened at the remark.


Without raising his voice, Felix added, "Hannah, you made the wise choice of divorcing him."
###Chapter 20 Stop Thinking She's UpFor Grabs
Vincent's brows drew together as he looked at Hannah."You told him we're divorced?"


Hannah lowered her gaze, fighting to swallow the bitterness rising in her throat. "I wasn't wrong." They were already divorced. He'd signed the divorce agreement without realizing it. It just hadn't been made public yet. In twenty days, the news would be official.


Unaware that the divorce was real, Vincent scowled.Had Hannah really repeated her angry words from one of their arguments to another man? No wonder Felix had acted so forward. He probably thought she was single.


"Oh really? And why would you say something like that? Is it because you actually like him?" Vincent questioned, a sneer tugging at his mouth. His entire expression turned cold and threatening.


"What nonsense are you talking about?" Hannah shot up from her seat, shooting Vincent a glare. As a few heads turned their way, she quickly lowered her voice."Have you lost it?"


"I should be the one asking that," Vincent snapped back, tapping his fingers on the table with growing frustration. "Did you forget you're still a married woman?"


A bitter laugh slipped from Hannah's mouth. "That's rich, coming from you. You don't exactly behave like a married man."


Vincent raised his hand and held it up. The gold band on his ring finger gleamed under the café light."How don't I? I wear this every single day." It was the ring she had picked for him and slipped onto his finger.


Turning her head away from him, Hannah retorted,"So what? There's still a line of women throwing themselves at you."
 Vincent's brow tightened. "I've said no to every single one of them."


"No, you didn't turn Brinley away," she muttered inwardly instead of saying them out loud. Her breathing grew uneven as she got emotional. A sudden wave of dizziness hit, and her legs gave way beneath her.


Vincent moved without hesitation, wrapping an arm around her waist to steady her.


Felix reached out too, but his reaction came just a second too late. He awkwardly pulled his hand back.


Vincent placed his hand gently against her forehead."Still lightheaded?"


Hannah batted his hand away. "I don't need your feigned concern."


Vincent's expression clouded over. Without a word,he firmly pressed her back into the chair. "If you're not fully recovered, then stop running around like you are."
"You really want me to get better?" she retorted."Then go back to your company.Do it now."


Vincent swallowed hard before replying, "There's no hurry."


Vincent looked ready to say more, but Felix quietly stepped in and handed Hannah a cup of water."Here.Drink this."



"Thank you." A quiet smile passed between them-a gentle, effortless exchange between two people who looked like they belonged in the same frame.


Vincent's eyes narrowed. His voice came out sharp and biting. "Mr. Wade, do you always go out of your way for women who belong to someone else?"


Felix didn't flinch. "Not really. But I doubt l've ever gone as far as you have with someone who isn't your wife." He hadn't let go of what he'd seen just days ago.


Vincent gave a dry laugh and stood. The smile vanished as quickly as it came, replaced by a cold,
 unreadable stare. He wasn't in the mood to waste words with Felix. He reached down, took hold of Hannah's wrist, and said, "We're going back to the hospital."


"No." She tried to wriggle her hand free.


"Yes." He tightened his grip on her.


"| said no."


They stood facing each other, neither one backing down.


Without warning, Vincent scooped her into his arms.


Heads turned across the café as every eye locked on them.


Hannah squirmed, fists landing against his chest with rapid,frustrated blows.


Her resistance only drew more attention from the room.


Vincent leaned in, his breath brushing her ear."Keep this up, and I won't hesitate to kiss you right here."
‘Hannah fell silent. That was exactly the kind of thing he'd follow through on without a second thought.She jerked her face to the side and stopped resisting.


Vincent carried her to the car without another word.Felix walked behind them, handing over her bag once she was inside.



"Felix, let's keep in touch," she said, her voice low.


"Of course. Always," he replied. He gave a small wave and started to leave.



But Vincent stopped him. "Thanks," he said, referring to the help with her things. Then, his tone turned sharp. "And stop thinking she's up for grabs. I'm not divorcing her. Not now, not ever."
###Chapter 21 Just A Normal FightBetween Husband And Wife

Felix leaned back, arms folded with a glint of defiance in his eyes. "Let me tell you something.When a woman gets hurt, she rarely looks back.Besides, Hannah told me herself she's divorced.I trust her word."



A shadow crossed Vincent's features. He touched his wedding ring, twisting it absentmindedly, before letting out a short, humorless laugh. "Just a normal fight between husband and wife. Couples argue all the time.How could you fall for her angry words?"


"Sometimes, a small argument is just the start. You'd be surprised how quickly things turn permanent,"Felix retorted, a smirk tugging at his mouth.


Vincent fixed him with an indifferent stare. "That's never happening." Without another glance,he swung open the car door and slid into the backseat.
Inside the Bentley, Hannah sat perfectly still,feigning asleep as the world outside faded to murmurs. Every word had slipped through the car window and settled in her chest. Was that really all Vincent thought this was? Just another argument? Did he honestly think their divorce was somne empty threat? Clearly, every sign of their failing marriage had escaped him. If he cared at all, he would have noticed the cracks that had split their lives apart ages ago-fractures that no amount of time could fix. There was no path left for them but divorce.



Vincent glanced over at Hannah, her forehead pressed to the window, and inched a bit closer.He tried to sound casual. "So, how do you know Felix?"


Hannah kept her eyes shut, refusing to answer.


Irritation crept into his voice. "Hannah. I'm speaking to you."


She kept her eyes closed. "All this talking is giving me a headache."


For good measure, she added, "And I don't need any more noise right now."


No part of her wanted to engage. Letting her head drift toward the window, she tried to edge herself as far from him as possible.



A muscle worked in Vincent's jaw, his patience wearing thin as his eyes darkened.


Nobody spoke. An uneasy hush filled the car, thick enough to suffocate. From the driver's seat, Derek stared straight ahead, careful not to breathe too loudly.


Their arrival at the hospital was brisk and silent.Vincent wasted no time getting Hannah checked in with one of the top neurologists, suspecting that her dizziness might be due to a mild concussion.


Testing finished quickly, and the doctor pronounced her mostly fine. He suggested she rest and ordered a round of IV fluids.



Long after the doctor's footsteps faded, Vincent remained rooted by her side.
 A casual tone colored her question. "You don't have anything to take care of at work?"


"I'll leave once your IV finishes," Vincent replied, his attention locked onto his phone as he scrolled through the latest contract his secretary had sent.


Shoulders lifting in a shrug, she replied, "Do as you please."


A flicker of curiosity made her steal a look at him.Every line of his face looked perfectly carved,and that small mole under his left eye caught the light.Someone once told her a mark like that belonged to someone with a cold soul. Focused as ever, he read his phone, the overhead lights framing his silhouette.


"You've been watching me," Vincent remarked, lifting a brow.


"If you noticed, you must have been watching me too," she shot back.


Vincent's eyes lit up. Just for a moment, it felt like old times-back when Hannah had been chasing after With a chuckle, he leaned in, lowering his voice."No matter what you say, I could feel your eyes on me for a while."


There was something tender in his eyes as he gazed at her.



Between them, the mood shifted, drawing them together in a silent, magnetic pull.


His crisp cologne floated between them, and she instinctively turned her face away from him. No matter how he looked at her, shestill felt like he was seeing someone else through her.


Out of nowhere, the sharp ring of his phone broke the silence.


At first, Vincent let it ring, pretending not to hear.Hannah nudged him lightly. "You should answer that."


His voice came out low. "Let it ring." He leaned closer, hoping to kiss her, as if the world outside could wait.  Her patience ran out. "Pick up, Vincent. It could be urgent."


She couldn't stomach being kissed by him, especially after his betrayal. Her body tensed, every nerve screaming resistance.


With a heavy sigh, Vincent finally took the call. His features turned all business upon hearing whatever the other end of the line had said. "I'll be there right away," he said before ending the call without another word.


"Something's happened at work. I have to leave." He grabbed his coat, already halfway out the door.


"Alright," she replied, barely above a whisper. This wasn't new to her. She was used to it by now.


"Let Derek take you home once you're finished here."


A short nod was all she gave. "Okay."


Vincent rattled off a handful of instructions and walked off, carrying the look of someone with pressing matters waiting on him.
###Chapter 22 A Staged Assault
Brinley stretched out on the couch in a secluded room at the bar. Empty bottles covered the floor near her feet.



Across the room, two men hovered close, getting handsy with her. One of them kept stealing looks at her chest, unable to help himself.


Brinley caught him right away, took his hand,and pressed it straight against her chest. "Be bolder," she said, letting her words slur like she was completely drunk. "Just go ahead and touch me-kiss me to0.Make it look real."


The two men exchanged a lewd grin. "If you insist,we won't say no."


The bolder one went further, yanking down her top and kissing her bare chest with abandon.


Brinley threw her head back, took another long drink,
and put up a weak struggle just for show.


This staged performance had a purpose. Brinley had witnessed what had unfolded at Chance Café this morning.The moment Hannah felt dizzy, Vincent had rushed to hold her and carried her to the car himself.All Brinley could think was, why was Vincent so concerned about Hannah? She was just a stand-in,nothing else.


Refusing to accept it, Brinley had decided to find out for herself if Vincent actually cared more about Hannah than about her. So, after seeng Vincent rush Hannah to the hospital, she'd hired these two men to stage a fake assault. When everything was in place,she'd "accidentally" called Vincent's number. He had not answered right away. Once he finally picked up,she'd remarked bluntly, "Don't touch me." With that,she'd hung up for the effect.


After that, he'd kept calling her back every ten minutes. She'd ignored each call, counting them in her head. When he'd called for the twenty-first time,she'd finally picked up. Her voice shook as she spoke."Vincent... Help me... I need you."
"Tell me where you are." Vincent's tone had come out icy and urgent.
She'd whispered, "I'm at Midnight Veil.." Then, she hung up.
Right now, the two men were clearly aroused, eyes dark with intent.
With a sly smile, Brinley said, "Take your pants off.Touch me like you mean it. Kiss me everywhere.Make it look real."
Since she had put on a performance, she made sure every detail was convincing. She reached into her purse, pulled out her phone, and twisted her face into an expression of pain and terror before handing the phone to one of the men. "Press record.Film me being 'assaulted.'"
After the video finished, Brinley took a moment to watch it. It turned out exactly the way she wanted.She smirked. The climax of the show was about to arrive. She struggled away from the men, only to be shoved down again.


Meanwhile, Vincent rushed through the club,searching room by room because he still had no idea which room Brinley was in. When he finally charged into the correct room, he saw Brinley pinned down by the two men, her clothes messy, and heard her calling out his name in pain.


Vincent's face twisted with anger. Without hesitation,he kicked both men aside. He took off his jacket and wrapped it around her shoulders. "Why did you come here alone?"



Tears streaming, Brinley threw her arms around him."Vincent, you misunderstood me earlier, and I was so upset that I sought comfort here. I never meant those words... Please don't stay angry at me..."


In the dim lighting, Vincent's expression was unreadable. "Let's get you out of here."


Brinley pressed herself to his side as they walked,but he gently moved away. "I'll get someone to bring you clean clothes," he said, taking a step back.


Desperate, Brinley grabbed his arm. "Do I disgust you now?" With her face hidden behind one hand,she began to sob again.


By the time she left the bar, Brinley was wrapped in Vincent's jacket, her arm looped tightly through his.Her eyes sparkled with victory. She knew it-Vincent still cared about her.


As he looked the other way, Brinley snapped a quick photo of herself leaning into him. She scrolled through her contacts until she found Hannah's name and sent the picture right away.

###Chapter 23 He Couldn't Find Me AndWent Completely Crazy

In the quiet of her hospital room, Hannah stared at the photo on her phone-zooming in, then out, then in again. She had no idea how many times she'd done that. In the photo, Brinley leaned against Vincent, her arm looped around his, and he didn't seem intent to push her away.


Brinley's message taunted Hannah beneath the image. "One call from me and Vincent dropped you flat. How does it feel, Hannah? He always comes running for me."


A second blow landed-a screenshot of Vincent's call log with a long row of missed calls. Twenty-one,no less. Brinley twisted the knife further. "Look at this. He couldn't find me and went completely crazy."


That number jabbed through Hannah's chest,sharp as any knife. It pulled up memories she'd tried to
bury: all those times she'd dialed Vincent, over and over, only to have every call go unanswered. Not once had he bothered to call her back. So he did know how to panic. He just never did it for her. For him, she was only ever the substitute-never the real thing.


Hannah's mind flashed back to the excuse Vincent had tossed out before leaving: a work crisis, a last-minute rush back to the office. But the truth was obvious now. He'd gone straight to Brinley's side.Another lie-one more in a string that had always been for someone else. Just moments ago, he'd been laughing with her, trying to steal a kiss-until his old flame beckoned, and he vanished without a backward glance.



A cold ache pressed into Hannah's chest. In five years of marriage, she'd never been the woman who got chosen first-never his clear priority. When Danica hurled insults at her, she'd reached for Vincent's number, only to be brushed off with the claim of being swamped with work. Whenever high-society heirs and their friends mocked her for not being polished enough, she'd planned to confide in him at dinner. But he hadn't come home-she'd stayed up all night, waiting for a door that didn't open.



Hannah had ventured to Vincent's workplace, only to catch wind of the staff's harsh whispers. "She's just his mistress," they'd said, dismissing her as if she meant nothing. Those cruel words had been thrown her way nonstop until she knew them by heart.Every visit ended the same way-she had always been asked to wait in the secretary's lounge while Vincent was perpetually "in a meeting," "signing papers," or,on one occasion, flying overseas while she was left behind sulking over another fruitless trip.



There had been so many days like that-so many times she wanted to confront him but couldn't even find him. And he always had the same excuse, "I'm busy." Eventually, she'd stopped chasing after him.


Then, on the day she went in for a routine checkup,she'd caught Vincent checking in at a hotel with Brinley. When she called, he'd lied without flinching.  If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, how many more of his so-called "busy" days would have fooled her?
Marriage to Vincent had hardened Hannah. She learned to build walls, to never let her hurt show,and -most important of all-to stop running to him for comfort when things fell apart.
Hannah shook her head and snapped out of her thoughts, taking a deep breath to steady herself.When her final IV finished dripping, she pressed the call button, let the nurse remove the needle, and walked out of the hospital on her own. Instead of asking Derek to fetch her,she hailed a taxi.
Back at the Jones estate, Vincent escorted Brinley to the guest suite on the third floor. "Take a shower and get some rest," he said, glancing at his watch. By now, Hannah's IV treatment at the hospital should be over.
"Vincent, could you stay?" Brinley's hand gripped his wrist, her gaze pleading and haunted. "I keep replaying everything that happened. I'm really  frightened."


He hesitated and then gently disengaged her grip."I'll ask my mother to come keep you company," he suggestedd, making it clear he had no intention of lingering.


Her voice trembled with longing. "We've known each other since we were children. Couldn't you stay-just for a while?"


Drawing a clear boundary,Vincent shook his head."I'm a married man," he replied, retreating a step.


"But you almost married me, didn't you?" Her words barely rose above a whisper.


Vincent met her gaze directly. "But the one Iactually married was Hannah."


He let the words hang between them before adding,"You've always understood the reason I was gentle with you. Don't mistake kindness for something more."
###Chapter 24 DDon't Do It Here


A heavy silence settled between Vincent and Hannah.

Vincent walked over to the door and said, "Get some rest." He eased the door shut behind him.

Brinley's hands curled into fists, anger simmering beneath the surface. She doubted Vincent truly felt nothing for her. Hannah could only ever be a substitute.

After Brinley sat and stewed in her thoughts, determination slowly set in. She would find a way to win Vincent back.

She hurrled through her shower, dabbed perfume on her neck and wrists, and wrapped herself in a pale pink towel before heading for Vincent's bedroom on the lower floor.

As Brinley entered the room, the sound of water told her Vincent was still in the bathroom. Not long after,he emerged, bare-chested, with damp hair and beads of water gliding down his abs. The moment he caught sight of her, he stopped in his tracks. A deep frown creased his face. He reached for a T-shirt and pulled it on without saying anything.

"You need something?" he asked flatly, fastening his watch. There was just enough time to pick Hannah up.

"Vincent," Brinley said in a gentle voice, moving a little closer, "I still love you. Can't we start over?"

His eyebrows drew together. "I don't feel the same. I thought I already told you that."

She faltered. Clearly, he still held a grudge over her decision to leave him for another country five years ago.She closed the gap between them without another word, rising onto her toes and pressing her lips to his.

Vincent wasted no time.He stepped away at once.

Right at that moment, a knock sounded at the door. A chilly voice came from the hallway."1f.you two want to have sex, maybe you should pick another room?"

Standing in the hallway was Hannah. She had originally planned to speak with Vincent's grandmother about the upcoming birthday banquet, but seeing how late it had gotten, she chose not to interrupt. Nothing could have prepared her for what greeted her when she stepped into her room. Even after convincing herself she had grown numb, the scene still managed to pierce her heart. After a brief pause, she gathered her composure.

Meanwhile, Brinley, caught off guard by Vincent's sudden movement, stumbled straight into his arms. He wasted no time in pushing her away.

A woman wrapped in only a towel. A man, still dripping from his shower.Anyone would find the situation suspicious.

Hannah decided not to ask for an explanation. "There are plenty of empty rooms upstairs on the third floor.You can use whichever you like."

Vincent stepped closer and tried to clarify. "She lost her balance. I just caught her."

"Oh," Hannah replied blandly.

Clutching her towel tightly, Brinley stepped forwardd, eyes wide as she put on an innocent act. "Hannah,please don't misunderstand. Vincent and I didn't do anything."

The words were meant for Vincent, of course-so he'd see how understanding she was. A sly smile flickered across her face, a silent challenge thrown in Hannah's direction.

The whole situation invited all kinds of assumptions.

Hannah simply turned her head away. She clearly had no intention to engage in this conversation.

Brinley didn't linger. Vincent's refusal stung, but she would never let it show. Keeping her composure, she quietly thanked him for his help that night and started walking upstairs. There was no rush. Time was on her side.

Meanwhile, back in the room, an uncomfortable silence settled between Vincent and Hannah.

Vincent opened his mouth to speak more than once, but Hannah barely responded, her gaze distant,her expression unreadable.

Only after a long stretch of quiet did Hannah finally say something, her words rough around the edges."Vincent, I've already tolerated those antics. But can you..." She paused, searching for the right words.

An uneasy pressure weighed on his chest.

"Can you not do it with Brinley here?" Her eyes dropped to the floor, and her voice sounded calm,far too calm. "I only ask that you don't make out with her in this room."
Memories flashed through Hannah's mind. They had lived here for over half a year after getting married.it was, in every sense, their shared bedroom-theirfirst true home together. Side by side, they had chosen every piece of furniture, every color, every detail. Every corner held pieces of their shared past.

He had replaced the original mattress because she'd complained it was too hard. He'd gone out of his way to find a softer one. She still remembered that night-he had made love to her not once,but three times just to be sure she liked it. A crib had even appeared beside their bed, bought in hopeful anticipation. But now,that little crib sat forgotten in the farthest corner.

During their stay in this place, even though Danica had often made things difficult for Hannah,Vincent had returned home each night and joined Hannah and his grandmother at the table.

Back then, their days had felt calm, even ordinary, but for Hannah, that peace had been the truest happiness she had ever known. In those moments, when her love for him was at its peak, every night in this room had left behind a trace of passion and intimacy. Now, she didn't want those precious memories to be tainted.

Vincent looked up at her, feeling a chill growing inside. His voice came out in a low, aching tone. "Is that how you see me?"
###Chapter 25 Throwing Him At Another Woman

"You tell me, Vincent-am I wrong?" Hannah's voice trembled with anger as she pointed at the bed. "If l hadn't walked in, would you have already had sex with Brinley right here?"
She bet Vincent understood what this room meant for both of them. After they moved out, Danica had tried over and over to change everything in this room. She had insisted on keeping it just the way it was. This space held real meaning for her. Maybe it meant something to Vincent too, but clearly not enough.
Vincent's voice turned cold. "So you're just going to accuse me without even asking what really happened? Did you not see me shove her away?"
"I saw it," Hannah replied, letting out a short,humorless laugh. "You only pushed her away because I walked in."
Vincent laughed out of anger. "How many times do l have to explain? There's nothing between me and Brinley."

"Is that so? Nothing at all?" Hannah retorted."Does 'nothing' mean taking her to a hotel? Lying on the same bed with her?"

His patience snapped. He grabbed her wrist and pulled her closer. "I took her to a hotel? Did you see it with your own eyes? Or were you hiding under the bed listening?"

With her hand pressed to his chest to create some distance, she responded sharply, "I saw it with my own eyes."

He took off his watch, his eyes fixed on her. "Then tell me-what did you see exactly? What position were we in?"

Before she could get a word out, Vincent pulled her onto the bed. He pinned her hands over her head,
because I walked in."
would have made a teasing remark. Maybe she would have leaned in and whispered something daring. He waited for a reaction from the Hannah he knew. But it didn't come.
Without warning, she shoved him back, scrambled off his lap, and said coldly, "If you're aroused, let Brinley take care of it for you."
She made for the door, but Vincent caught her wrist."There's nothing happening between me and Brinley.I've always told you, she's like a sister to me."
"Oh," Hannah replied, her voice flat.
"I'm serious. I've never even slept with her," Vincent remarked, his face set.
Hannah froze. In all his years, he'd only ever dated two women-Brinley and her. So, if he wasn't lying,that meant back when they first got together,he was - Her eyes dropped, despite herself, landing right where his arousal showed through his pants. "You handle it yourself."
Vincent pulled her closer, his voice rumbling low. "So my dear wife is just going to leave me like this?"


His eyes lingered on her lips. The tension between them curled thick and slow, like smoke in the dark.


His words stirred something inside her. Still,reason rose like a wall between them. It made no difference that he and Brinley had never slept together. Maybe he held back for being a gentleman. That did not change the fact that Brinley had always been the one he truly loved. She had only ever been the substitute.And this was something he could've told her earlier,so why was she only hearing it now? None of it mattered anymore.


"Brinley would love nothing more than to help take care of your desire." Once again, she tried to push him away, but his arms only tightened around her.


"I've spelled it out for you, and you're still throwing me at another woman?" he asked coldly.
###Chapter 26 Maybe Your Son's The Problem

"Wasn't Brinley your first love?" Hannah's words Oozed sarcasm."Isn't it just typical for a man to get excited when his first love suddenly reappears?"
"Who put the idea in your head that Brinley was ever my first love?" Vincent replied sharply.
Her lashes fluttered slightly. Skepticism crept in. If Brinley was not his first, then who could it have been? She shot him a scornful look. "Anyway, don't count on me to help you." It was obvious to her that men driven by desire could lie convincingly.
Already on edge, Vincent snapped, "With the sour look on your face, I could not be less interested."
The words left his lips, and regret crept in immediately. He tried to take it back, but Hannah was quicker. "Is that so? Then maybe stop pressing your lower half against me," she retorted, shoving him away as his grip slipped. "Honestly, you disgust me."
That was the end of it. The fight ended with both of them angry and nothing solved.
Vincent locked himself in the study, his chest heavy and tense.
Two full days went by without a word between them.
Vincent started leaving the house early and coming home late. Meanwhile, Hannah jumped right back into her role at Nova Tech. In just forty-eight hours,she'd fired the procurement manager, overhauled the organizational structure, and left the staff grumbling behind her back-calling her a flashy figurehead with no real skills, just someone riding on connections.
The gossip pages soon lit up with bold headlines about Vincent and Brinley-"Jones Group CEO Acts out for His First Love." The story dominated the entertainment news all afternoon.
That was how Hannah learned what Vincent had  really been up to after leaving her at the hospital the other day-he had rushed off to play the hero for Brinley.
Brinley kept texting Hannah photo after photo of the decorations for Sharon's upcoming birthday party.Hannah did not bother to respond.
Vincent instructed Clive to wipe the story from every entertainment site. Not long after, Derek messaged Vincent about the suit jacket-it didn't belong to Felix, and they were still working on figuring out its mysterious owner.

Vincent grunted in response and ended the call.


The next morning, almost everyone was home-Brinley was the only one missing. Sharon's eyes sparkled as she saw the family together and called everyone over for breakfast.
A fair amount of time had passed since Hannah last saw Sharon.She purred, "Sharon, I missed you." She leaned in and rested her head on Sharon's shoulder,showing real affection.
Sharon reached up and gave Hannah's nose a playfu pinch. "You sweet thing. I missed you just as much."She smoothed Hannah's hair and grinned. "Now,about the baby, how is that coming along? Will I get to hear some good news on my birthday? Nothing would make me happier than the arrival of a great-grandchild."
While speaking, Sharon turned her gaze toward Vincent,making her expectations perfectly clear.
Vincent hesitated for a moment and then replied honestly, "When things slow down at work, I'll take Hannah away on a vacation." The meaning behind his words was unmistakable.
Hannah managed a polite, well-practiced smile. A baby? She would leave Vincent's world entirely in eighteen days. Lowering her eyes, she quietly took a spoonful of porridge.
Danica, unable to keep quiet, looked Hannah up and down. "If you want my opinion, the issue probably
lies with Hannah. Five years and not a single child?That's definitely strange."

Vincent's face tightened with anger.
Danica shrugged, tossing up her hands. "Don't look at me like that. Somebody had to say it."
Hannah's grip on her spoon tightened. All those old hurts rushed back instantly. She faced Danica and spoke with steady clarity.r maybe your son's the problem."
In the past, Hannah had done everything she could to win Danica's approval, all for Vincent's sake. Yet no matter her efforts, it had never been good enough. Danica never accepted her. But now, none of that mattered anymore.
A muscle jumped in Vincent's jaw.
Danica stared at Hannah, caught off guard."What's that supposed to mean?"

"I went for a full checkup. The doctor said | was perfectly healthy. So, the childless issue is not on mell Hannah said, her tone cool. She cast a glance at Vincent. "Lately, I've noticed he's a little off. Not quite the stamina he used to have."
Two nights had passed since they last shared a bed.Now, Hannah was throwing it in his face in front of everyone. Vincent could tell she was doing it on purpose.
###Chapter 27 Your Kissing Skills HaveGotten Worse
Sharon gave Vincent a worried look. "I know work keeps you busy, but your health should come first.You need to look after yourself, Vincent."
Vincent offered a quick reassurance. "I will,Grandma." Yet, his gaze drifted to Hannah instead of Sharon.

Danica didn't look pleased. She hated hearing anyone suggest her son might have any shortcomings. She hissed, "Have you no shame,Hannah? How can you talk about something so personal in front of everyone?"
"You were the one who brought it up," Hannah answered, her tone even.only explained why there hasn't been a pregnancy. If you didn't want the answer, you shouldn't have asked. Honestly, I don't care to talk about it either."
Danica sputtered, caught off guard. Hannah had become far bolder lately, never biting her tongue anymore.

But Danica kept telling herself he would only need to tolerate Hannah for a little while longer. Ten more days, at most. She clung to her authority. For now she could still give orders. She shifted her tone and yelled at Hannah, "Go clean out the attic after breakfast!"

Everyone knew that old attic was filled with clutter.Danica just wanted to give Hannah a hard time.

Hannah's reply was flat and direct. "No. I'm not here to play maid."
The last two days, while things were icy between Vincent and Hannah, Danica was eager to pile on more chores, but Hannah refused to do any of them.

Danica rolled her eyes. "Really? All I asked was to move some boxes. Is that such a burden?"

Setting her spoon down, Hannah flashed a dry smile.
"Exactly. I'm much too delicate for that. I can't handle heavy lifting."
"You are absolutely the wrong kind of person to marry into the Jones family!" Danica slammed her hand down hard on the table.

Hannah retorted, "If being your daughter-in-law means I'm just a servant, then I don't want the role at all."
Tension filled the room. Danica drew a breath to argue, but Sharon spoke up. "Enough, both of you.Can we please finish breakfast without turning it into a fight?"
Danica tried to justify herself. "She doesn't show me any respect."
Sharon said calmly,"And you haven't exactly shown her much respect either. Giving her chores? That was out of line."

Once upon a time, Sharon had managed the entire household on her own-her voice still commanded
attention. Just a few words from her were enough to put Danica in her place.
Nobody else dared to direct another comment at Hannah for the remainder of breakfast.

After the meal, Vincent fixed his mother with a stern look. "Stop ordering Hannah around like she's just the help. She's my wife."
Returning to her room, Hannah settled at her desk and began sketching a floral brooch for Sharon's birthday celebration. She had never studied design formally, but she picked up drawing for Vincent's sake. She had already settled on the gladiolus. Its symbolism of honor and strength felt like a fitting way to celebrate Sharon's life.
So deep in concentration, Hannah barely noticed when the door opened. Vincent leaned in close,curiosity clear on his face. "What are you working on?"
Startled, she quickly pulled the sketchbook away."Nothing important. Shouldn't you be at the office?"
She only wanted him out of the room.
His hand slipped up her skirt. "No stamina, huh?"
Hannah swatted his hand away and stood up.
Vincent pressed her gently against the wall, turning the lock on the door behind him.
She pressed her hands against his chest to create some distance and asked, "What's gotten into you?"
"I just want to show you there's nothing wrong with my stamina," he replied, his grin growing wider.
She tried to push him away.are you out of your mind? It's the middle of the day."
"So?" He dipped his head and kissed her without warning.
Hannah clamped her mouth shut and pushed against his chest.
Vincent kissed her hard, insistent.
She fought back, but for a split second, she faltered and he took his chance. His tongue chased hers,relentless.

Cornered, Hannah bit his lip, leaving the taste of blood between them.

He jerked back,startled.

A spark of mischief danced in Hannah's eyes as she wiped her mouth. "Vincent, your kissing skills have gotten worse."
###Chapter 28 Don't Touch Me


Vincent seized the back of Hannah's neck and pressed her against the vanity. His breath came in hot bursts as he leaned even closer. "Then let's test it again. See if I really suck at kissing."

Hannah jerked her head away, planting both hands on his chest to shove him back. "Let go of me!"

"No." Vincent only tightened his grip.

Anger flashed through her. She drove her knee into his stomach. Her elbow knocked over the makeup on the table, sending compacts and bottles tumbling onto the wool carpet.

Drawing in rough breaths, Vincent grabbed for her wrists, using his knee to pry her legs apart.

But then, all at once, Hannah stopped struggling. Her stare was cold and empty as she looked up at him."Don't touch me."

That made him froze.

She used the moment to break free, shoving him away. With one quick motion, she wiped her mouth and said in a low voice, "You make me sick."	~

He felt those words land hard, as if she had slapped him."Sick?" he asked sharply, yanking her back so roughly that she nearly lost her balance.

Her wrist reddened where his hand gripped too tightly.

Hannah snapped back. "Now, whenever you touch me, I feel like throwing up."

Something sharp flickered across his expression. Still, instead of releasing her, he only squeezed harder.

Their breathing mingled in the air-hers coming out fast and angry, his heavy and harsh.

They faced each other in silence until loud pounding on the door echoed.

Danica's shrill voice cut through the tension. "Hlannah! Open this door right now!" She tried the handle,finding it locked. "Why are you locking doors in the middle of the day? What exactly are you hiding?"

A second voice sounded from outside, this one softer and pleading-Brinley."Danica, perhaps we should just let it go."

Danica was not having it."NO,Brinley. You're always too gentle. That's why people take advantage of you."

One thing was clear.Danica would not stop until she got what she wanted for Brinley.

"Hannah, open this door!" Danica's pounding grew even louder. "Don't make me repeat myself!"

The lock clicked at last, but it was Vincent who swung the door open, not Hannah. His face was stormy with anger.

Danica's eyes widened in shock. "Vincent? What are you doing here? I thought you already left for work."

"I didn't," he muttered.

While Danica missed the strained atmosphere, Brinley caught it right away, and her gaze went straight to Hannah's lips. It was obvious enough what had just taken place.

A flash of jealousy burned in Brinley's eyes. She had practically begged Vincent to touch her, and he never did. Yet, with Hannah, in the middle of the day, he could not seem to help himself. What made Hannah so special? Wasn't she just a stand-in?

Quick to hide her feelings, Brinley adjusted her expression and played her part."Danica, let's just leave it alone. There's no point arguing."	a

Danica gave her hand a reassuring pat, still unwilling to back down. "Absolutely not. We can't just let this slide. Vincent deserves to know what kind of person Hannah really is."

Hannah's eyes narrowed. "Then go on. Tell everyone what supposed wrongdoings I did."

Vincent's expression changed. "What happened?"

Danica wasted no time, thrusting her phone at him. "Vincent, you have to look at this. Look at what Hannah's done! These messages prove it-she wanted to hurt Brinley!"

Screenshots filled the phone's display, all showing conversations that seemed to suggest Hannah had arranged for someone to rape Brinley.

Brinley stood off to the side, eyes glistening with tears, her face an image of heartbreak and innocence.

Pointing straight at Hannah, Danica's voice grew shrill with accusation. "You hired someone to harass Brinley! What do you have to say now?"
###Chapter 29 Framed


Vincent's expression grew even colder. "What happened here? Tell me straight."

Brinley lowered her gaze, silent tears slipping down her cheeks.

Danica was the first to explode, grabbing Vincent's arm in outrage."I'd just finished breakfast and went up to check on Brinley. The moment I walked in, I found her in tears. No matter how many times I asked, she wouldn't say a word. That's when I knew-something serious had gone on."

"Get to the point," Vincent snapped, his patience wearing thin.

Danica hesitated for a moment, visibly irritated by the interruption, but then continued, "The point is-Brinley discovered that the harassment at the club was planned. And it was your wife who paid those men!"

Vincent's gaze locked on Brinley. "How do you know it was Hannah?"

Brinley looked as if she wanted to disappear, her face drained and uncertain, as though she hated being the one to speak. Danica rubbed her shoulder and remarked softly, "You can say it, Brinley. We're here to support you."

After that, Danica sent a sharp glare in Hannah's direction.

Hannah ignored her entirely, keeping her attention fixed on the supposed evidence. The phone's screen displayed screenshots of chat logs, messages Brinley claimed had been forwarded to her. The exchange discussed paying two men to scare a woman-harassment was the goal, but anything more would be fine.The payment shown was 100, 000 dollars. The transfer record read: Hannah Scott. This was a setup-meticulously planned from the start.

Hannah arched an eyebrow, looked at Brinley, and said calmly, "That wasn't my doing."

Danica sneered, "Still deny/it? Your name is right there!"

After the scene at breakfast, Danica had been itchy for an opportunity to bring Hannah down. This was exactly what she wanted.

Brinley lingered in silence, looking as if she was wrestling with herself, and finally managed to speak. "That night, after Vincent took me home, I couldn't stop having nightmares. I kept wondering what I'd done wrong,
so I hired someone to investigate. That's how I found those messages and the bank transfer." Tears rolled down her cheeks. "I just never imagined that Hannah would hate me enough to destroy me."

Danica pulled Brinley close, throwing an accusing finger at Hannah. "Did you hear that? And you still refuse to admit what you did? You malicious snake!"

Hannah let out a laugh. "Well, since you're so sure I paid off those men, then bring them in. Let's hear their story right to my face."

Brinley's crying became even more dramatic. "I... I just can't do that. I never want to see those men again.Just the thought of them makes me sick."

Hannah raised an eyebrow. "Or is it possible you're just scared of what might come out?"

Danica erupted. "How can you be so heartless? Can't you see she's traumatized? She doesn't want to relive any of it!"

Naturally, Danica took Brinley's side without question.

Hannah's voice grew cold. "Maybe the real reason Brinley won't face them is because none of it was real.Maybe the whole thing was staged. Maybe this little act is just a way to drag my name through the mud."

Danica flushed with rage."Unbelievable! First,you hurt her, and now, you call her a liar? You're despicable!"

Danica raised her hand, ready to slap Hannah. Vincent stepped in, catching Danica's wrist before she could follow through.
###Chapter 30 Just Wanted An Apology


"We still don't have all the facts," Vincent said with a frown, his voice turning even colder.

Danica grew restless. "Vincent, how can you say that? Brinley's already dug up so much evidence. Hannah did this to her!"

Vincent stayed calm,replying,"1was the one who'd picked Brinley up that day. At that time, Hannah was still in the hospital. How would she have pulled this off?"

Brinley's expression faltered for a brief moment.

Danica muttered, "She must have arranged everything ahead of time. She could have hired those men long before. She didn't need to be there in person."

A wave of cold swept through Hannah. Danica's dislike for her really ran deep. Looking back at how desperately she once tried to earn Danica's approval, she saw now what a waste it had been.

Turning to Vincent, Hannah was surprised. She never expected him to intervene, much less defend her.

Brinley pressed her lips together, tears welling up again. "Vincent, when I first found out about this 1doubted it too. I struggled to believe Hannah would go so far." Tears streamed down her cheeks, every look crafted for sympathy. "But I have proof-a recording. The two men even mentioned her name."

Brinley took out her phone and played the audio for everyone to hear. "The client? Yeah, it was that woman,Hannah... Hannah Scott or something. She said we could do anything to Brinley and promised a big bonus when it was over. Brinley was a reaI looker, smooth skin, tiny waist, any man would want to..."

Brinley hastily stopped the recording, visibly flustered. She looked at Hannah with shaking eyes. "I know you never liked me, and you hated that I came to the Jones house. But I never imagined you'd try to hurt me like this."

Danica kept rubbing Brinley's back in a show of comfort, while Vincent tapped his fingers on the table, his face impossible to read.

Hannah could barely stop herself from laughing. "That's your so-called proof? Getting two guys to say my name in a recording? What exactly does that prove? And if I had actually hired them, do you think I'd have been dumb enough to use my real name?"

Brinley flinched but quickly recovered with a wounded sigh. "Hannah, I only want an apology. But after everything we've shown, you don't even seem a bit sorry."

Hannah folded her arms, her tone unwavering. "Why should I apologize for something I didn't do?"

Fresh tears sparkled in Brinley's eyes. "Then explain why your phone has a video of me being harassed by those men at the club?"

Hannah's eyebrows drew together in confusion. A heavy feeling of dread settled in her stomach."What are you even talking about?"

Before Hannah could react, Danica stepped forward and snatched Hannah's phone out of her grip.

Brinley wasted no time. She opened the photo album, found a video, played it, and shoved the screen in front of Hannah. "Are you still going to claim you had nothing to do with this?"

Brinley's desperate screams echoed from the phone speaker.

Hannah stared at the unfamiliar video playing on her own device. Then, it hit her-just yesterday, Brinley had visited her room, supposedly to discuss plans for Sharon's birthday. Right in the middle of their talk, Danica had called her downstairs. She had left her phone behind. That must have been when Brinley made her move.

Hannah's fists tightened with anger. Brinley must have realized the audio was not enough, so she planted this video as backup-now she was pressing her advantage.

Danica pounced right away. "What now? You're out of excuses. Say sorry to Brinley. Right noW."

Hannah lifted her head, her eyes steady. "If there's a video, why stop at apologies? Let's get the police involved."

Danica's face twisted in outrage. She clutched her forehead."Have you lost it? Dragging this to the police-what does that do for the Jones family?" She shook Vincent's arm, growing frantic. "Vincent, are you just going to let her do as she pleases? Do you really want to involve the police?"

Brinley didn't want to involve the police either. Her eyes welled up as she turned to Vincent. "Vincent, I'm not asking for much. I just want Hannah to apologize. That's it. The police won't fix anything.It'll only reopen my wounds and make me relive it all over again."
Hannah couldn't stand another moment of Brinley's theatrics in front of Vincent. She grabbed the phone back from Brinley's grasp."You want an apology? Let's see what the police think. By the time this is finished, you might owe me an apology."

She started to dial, but Vincent moved fast and blocked the screen with his hand."We're not involving the police," he said, voice flat and final.
###Chapter 31 Just Hollow Concern


Hannah's temper flared. "And why the hell not involve the police?"

Vincent's reply was cold, his grip still tight on her wrist. "It wouldn't be good for Brinley's reputation."

Hannah smirked. So that was all it came down to. Brinley's image meant everything. As for her, the stand-in,she never even factored into his thinking. Any hint of warmth she'd felt earlier when he spoke up for her vanished in aheartbeat. What a joke. He was trash.

With a sharp motion, Hannah slapped his hand away, refusing to back down. "That's rich, coming from you.Your affair with Brinley has already made it into every gossip column. But now you're suddenly afraid of bad press?" There was steel in her voice. No one would stop her. "I'm calling the police. No one could stop me."

Since they wanted to drag her name through the mud, she would defend herself-no more silent suffering.

Brinley/ saw that Hannah meant it and quickly panicked. She lunged and shoved Hannah-hard enough to make Hannah slam into the corner of the table.

Hannah's phone went flying, clattering against the floor.

Seizing the moment, Brinley leaned backward to make it look like she somehow lost her balance,all the while she extended her hands to wrap her arms around Vincent's neck, clinging to him like some helpless damsel. And she didn't stop there. As she played the victim, she pressed her heel down on Hannah's phone over and over.

So this was the scene Hannah took in: her husband supporting the very woman who had shoved her on purpose. And he just stood there, showing concern toward her attacker instead of helping her. The irony was almost laughable.Pain shot up her lower back-it would definitely bruise. It hurt like hell.

Brinley straightened up and remarked to Vincent in a gentle, unsteady voice, "Thank you."

Hannah let out a mocking smile and picked up her shattered phone. "Really, you should be thanking me. lf you hadn't slammed into me, you never would have landed in Vincent's arms."

With downcast eyes, Brinley said in a quiet voice, "I'm sorry, Hannah. I just didn't want things to spiral out of control. I got carried away... I didn't mean to hurt you." She made it sound so noble, as though every move was for the Jones family'ssake.

A cold laugh escaped Hannah as she waved the ruined phone. "What's the plan? Break my phone so I can't call the cops? You really think that's enough to stop me?"

Danica, for her part, looked delighted. At least, Hannah couldn't involve the police for now. The last thing she wanted was to become tea-time gossip among Dorbarrow's upper crust. She much preferred being waited on and praised, not whispered about over tea.

Vincent moved closer to Hannah. "Where are you hurt?"

Hannah jerked away from him, her face stone-cold. "Don't act concerned."

He cast a hard look at Danica and Brinley, keeping his tone low. "Leave us."

Danica pressed her lips together. "Not until Hannah says sorry to Brinley."

"I said leave," Vincent remarked, the lines on his forehead deepening.

Danica wanted to protest, but with one look at his expression, she fell silent and slipped out.

Brinley followed Danica reluctantly, not before throwing one sharp glare Hannah's way.

Closing the door, Vincent tried to lift Hannah's shirt to check for injuries.

She slapped his hand away. "What, you still want to make out with me?"

His expression darkened. "I just want to check your injury."

"I'm fine. Go get cozy with Brinley instead," Hannah retorted, heading for the door.

Vincent stopped her and gently pushed her onto the bed. "Lie down. Let me see your back."

"I said no." She squirmed and tried to get up, but he straddled her and pinned her wrists with one hand.

With his free hand, he lifted her shirt. A large, deep bruise had already started to form along her waist.

His fingers brushed against the bruise, and Hannah sucked in a breath, the pain sharp and sudden. "If you just want to look, then keep your hands off," she said, brow furrowed in discomfort.
He softened his touch and spoke quietly."Let me put some ointment on it."

She glared at him. "I don't need your help."

Vincent fetched the first-aid kit anyway. Ignoring her protest, he pinned her in place, lifted her shirt again,and started to apply the ointment.

Realizing there was no point resisting, Hannah lay back and kept still. So Vincent still cared-at least, a little.If all this hadn't happened, maybe this gesture from him would've made her happy. But now, it didn't stir anything in her at all. It was just hollow concern.
###Chapter 32 Let's Get A Divorce


Vincent pushed his sleeves up to his elbows. He warmed his hands by rubbing them together, and then gently began to work the bruise on Hannah's waist. His touch was light and careful, never once causing her any pain.

A thick silence filled the space between them.

After a while, Vincent spoke in a low voice. "Brinley isn't a bad person. She didn't mean any of this. Don't hold it against her."

A sharp, bitter laugh escaped Hannah. So this was why he applied the ointment for her, not out of care, but to keep her from calling the police and to prevent things from getting out of hand. So much for concern.It was all for another woman.

Hannah pushed herself upright, tilting her chin as she stared at him with a cold smirk. "Vincent, did you miss what just happened, or do you just not want to see it? She started all of this, and now you want me to just let it go? I'm not that forgiving."

Disappointment shone in her eyes as she brushed his hand away.

Vincent stayed where he was, pressing his fingers to the bridge of his nose, frustration plain on his face."You weren't like this before."

His words made Hannah freeze. Not like this before? A chill swept through her, leaving her numb. He'd reminded her of how she used to bend over backward for his family. Now that she no longer cared to hide her sharp edges, he missed the tolerant and gentle version of her. But that girl? Vincent had killed her with his own hands. No. Precisely speaking, he didn't miss her past self. He missed the docile, self-sacrificinggirl who reminded him of Brinley.

Her eyes went frosty. She kicked him away."Just leave. Go be with your precious Brinley."

"I'm not finished with the ointment," Vincent replied, voice tight and strained.

"I don't need your help with the ointment. The pain doesn't bother me." She turned her head away, the sting from the ointment and the throb in her waist paled in comparison to the ache in her chest. Her heart felt like it was bleeding.
Vincent's jaw tightened. Brinley had become a sore spot between them-mention her once, and Hannah's claws came out. Every time, they ended up fighting. How had everything fallen apart so completely? They could not go even a minute without falling into an argument.

Another heavy silence settled over the room.

At last, Hannah stood up, her eyes fixed on the floor. "Vincent, we really can't go on like this." She drew in a steady breath. "Let's get a divorce."

Darkness clouded Vincent's face. "That's not happening. Just drop that idea."

A wry smile touched her lips. "Vincent, don't be stubborn. What's the point of dragging this out?" He was the one who'd treated her as Brinley's stand-in-and yet he was also the one who refused to let her go.

"You want a divorce that badly?" His gaze pinned her down.

"I'm sick." Hannah lifted her eyes, her stare distant, as if he were nothing but a stranger now. "Five years is long enough."

They had spent five years as husband and wife. For five years, she'd given him everything she had while he'd treated her like a substitute for Brinley. She didn't want to go on like this anymore.

The silence grew even heavier.

Vincent stared at her, emotion flickering in his eyes-fury, disbelief, and something darker. Her eyes burned with quiet resolve, adding to his inner turmoil.

"It's not happening," he said at last, his tone leaving no room for argument."Get that idea out of your head."

She gave him a small, empty smile. "Vincent, aren't you tired by all this?"

Five years of looking at her, seeing only Brinley's shadow-wasn't he sick of it? She had been a stand-in for five years without realizing it until recently. Even if he was fine with it, she was finished.

She swallowed her bitterness and added, "If we divorce, you can give Brinley a proper title. That's better than whatever this mess is."

Vincent's mouth set in a hard line. His expression was thunderous. "I've already told you, whatever you think about Brinley and me,you're wrong."

A storm of tension thickened the air.
Just then, a knock broke through the heaviness. "Mr. Jones, your meeting is about to start," Derek remarked from the other side of the door.
###Chapter 33 They Once Had A Child


"Alright," Vincent said to Derek before shifting hisattention back to Hannah. "P'll handle this. You stay put and get some rest. From this moment on, I don't want to hear you mention 'divorce' ever again."

Without another word, he stepped out and closed the door behind him. He hadn't taken Hannah's talk of divorce seriously. He was convinced Hannah loved him far too deeply to ever mean it.

A bitter, almost mocking smile played on Hannah's lips. He hadn't even bothered to give her an answer to her simple question.

Inside the Bentley, Derek noticed the tension in Vincent's face, his brows pulled tight with worry."Another fight with Mrs. Jones?" he asked, his voice cautious as he didn't want to press too hard.

No reply came from Vincent.

Derek forced a weak laugh, still determined to offer advice."Mr. Jones, you're going about this all wrong.Women always need a little sweet-talking."

Derek clearly thought he knew a thing or two aboout relationships and was just getting warmed up when Vincent shot him a cold, warning glare. Instantly,he fell silent.

Vincent's thoughts wandered. His memories took him back to childhood-he had grown up alongside Brinley and her brother. When he was seven, he and her brother had tumbled into the sea together.Brinley's father had reached him first before going back for his own son, but the tide had been merciless, swallowing them both. Brinley had only been five years old then.

Shaking the memory away, Vincent turned to Derek, frown deepening. "Check what happened at Midnight Veil,especially with those two men who'd harassed Brinley."

"Understood," Derek replied.

A moment of hesitation showed on Derek's face before he asked, "Should I keep looking into the jacket's owner?"

"Keep digging into it," Vincent answered, voice clipped.

"Got it."
On her end, Hannah still filed a report with the police. Unfortuhately, without concrete evidence,the case remained at a standstill. Determined not to let the matter drop, she brought in a private detective.She was done watching the truth slip away. This time, she promised herself, she would stand her ground and fight back.

A short while later, she found herself at a phone repair shop-there was a precious photo on that phone, and she needed it restored at any cost.

The technician gave her a knowing look and a half-smile. "Let me guess, lost pictures with your boyfriend?Sentimental memories mean a lot, don't they?"

Hannah met his gaze with a small, polite smile and stayed silent.

Competence was clearly the technician's specialty. In only a few minutes, he managed to power the device back up.

Nervous energy filled Hannah's hands as she scrolled through the photos. One album caught her eye-Family. She selected a single black-and-white image and quickly sent it to her new phone. "Everything's done. Thank you," she said, gratitude flickering in her soft smile.

Curiosity lingered on the technician's face. "That's all? There are dozens more photos in that album."

"No, I just need this one," she replied simply. For her, the most precious photo was not a picture of her and Vincent, but the ultrasound of their child when it was just a month old.

The technician stood by the counter, momentarily puzzled, as Hannah gathered her things and walked away without a second glance.

She and Vincent had once had a child. But he didn't know. She had been overjoyed when she first learned she was pregnant. She had everything planned-a romantic dinner, a framed printout of the ultrasound,ready to surprise him. But he hadn't walked through the door that night. His voice had come over the phone,distant and cold. "Don't wait up."

Still, she had wanted to tell him the good news in person. The next morning, she dressed with care, set her disappointment aside, and had the drivertake her straight to Vincent's office. But no luck-Vincent was nowhere to be found. He had already left the country on an urgent trip.
The secretaries had mentioned it had something to do with work tied to a subsidiary, but also to reconnect with his first love.

That was when Hannah had first found out that Vincent's first love lived abroad. Hurt and furious, she'd kept calling him again and again, but he never once answered.

And the secretaries? They'd scorned her, urging her to stop hanging on to Vincent and do something useful.Said she was perfectly capable-why not earn a decent living instead of being Vincent's kept woman?

Their words had struck something raw. And Hannah had been at a loss to defend herself. She couldn't just reveal her secret marriage to Vincent.
###Chapter 34 A Threat


After returning from his trip abroad, Vincent had buried himself under endless paperwork, leaving Hannah with no chance to mention her pregnancy.

Then, trouble struck in the most mundane way-Hannah had accidentally slipped in the bathroom, panic setting in as blood began to pour. Desperate, she'd dialed Vincent's number twenty-nine times without pause. But not once had he answered. The delay of prompt treatment had cost her dearly. Their infant,only a month along, hadn't made it.

During Hannah's entire hospital stay post miscarriage, Vincent had never set foot in her ward or reached out since he-remained oblivious to her pregnancy, let alone her miscarriage.

After her release from the hospital, she'd kept the ultrasound photo as her only remembrance, ripping up the printout she'd once placed at home as if to erase a ###Chapter of hope.

This was why Brinley's screenshot showing twenty-one calls from Vincent had hit Hannah like a blow-Vincent had never panicked for her like that. When she had desperately needed him, he hadn't bothered to pick up her calls. All those feelings, however, seemed distant now.

Arriving home, Hannah bumped into Derek, who had returned to grab some work files for Vincent. A simple question passed her lips. "Did I leave a suit jacket in the car the other day?"

Maybe Miles wouldn't care about a jacket, but Hannah felt returning it was the right thing to do. Whether or not he accepted it-that was his business.

Derek hesitated, feigning ignorance. "Mrs. Jones, I didn't notice anything."

Her brow knitted in suspicion. "Please look for it for me. I'm sure it's in the car somewhere."

He gave a quick nod. "Alright."

Stepping inside, Hannah barely made it past the hallway before Danica intercepted her, voice sharp with accusation."I knew it-you hit a dead end with the police, didn't you? How does it feel to hit a wall?"

Suspicion narrowed Hannah's eyes. "Did you follow me?"

Danica didn't bother to deny it."So what if I was? Someone has to keep you from disgracing the Jones family.You're leaving Vincent-why do you keep stirring up trouble?"

A sardonic chuckle escaped Hannah. Her gaze frosted over."Let's set the record straight, Danica, if I wanted drama, I'd tear up that divorce agreement and sit tight as Vincent's wife."

Fury crashed across Danica's face as she slammed her palm on the table. "Don't you dare!"

"Try me," Hannah replied, folding her arms. "Friendly reminder-you've got 16 days left before transferring the rest of your properties to me. When will I see those deeds?"

"I told you already-property transfers take time! What's got you breathing down my neck?" Danica practically shouted.

Hannah's smile was icy. "Don't get it twisted. I'm not impatient. But let me spell this out-those seven properties better show up, or you can forget ever seeing the divorce agreement again. Let's see who panics first." She casually straightened Danica's collar. "Looking forward to hearing some progress on the property transfer."

With that,Hannah turned on her heel and made for the stairs.

The thud and crash of furniture being overturned filled the house seconds later, but Hannah climbed the steps without missing a beat. Once in her room, thoughts of rest vanished when Felix's name popped up on her phone. The office needed her, so out the door she went.	a

Chaos found its way online that night as Nova Tech suddenly faced a tidal wave of public criticism over product safety. A group calling themselves "Victims of Nova Tech" appeared almost overnight.

The company's response was swift-a product recall was announced, along with a flurry of compensation offers for angry customers.

Hannah started digging into the detailed info of the supposed victims, and her search pointed straight to an apartment complex not far from her company. That detail set off every alarm in her mind.

Hours slipped by as she combed through data, and it was deep into the night before she made it back to the Jones estate.

A little sleep did nothing to slow her down. Plans for Sharon's birthday party came next on her never-ending list.
Meanwhile, things at the Jones Group office took a surprising turn. Vincent delivered two orders to Clive.First, he wanted every last project completed within the month because he intended to take a three-month break. Second, he instructed Clive to arrange for a ring with a sixteen-millimeter inner diameter and made it clear that the ring needed to be delivered within three months.

For a moment, Clive could only stare. His mind raced-was Vincent about to propose to Brinley?
###Chapter 35 Guilt-trip Him


No sooner had Clive finished wondering about Vincent's big plans than Brinley arrived, breezing through the reception.

"Hello, Mr. Monroe. Is Vincent available right now?" Brinley purred.

A spark of intrigue lit up Clive's eyes. "He's in his office," he answered, barely hiding his excitement.

An odd glance from Brinley caught his expression, but she let it go without a word.

Earlier, Clive had nearly spilled Vincent's request for a ring in his surprise-luckily, he managed to hold back.

Skipping any kind of announcement, Brinley swung open Vincent's office door and stepped inside. "Are you free at the moment, Vincent?"

Without looking away from his paperwork, Vincent responded, "Next time, try knocking first."

Although she pulled a face, she didn't protest.

"Is there something you needed?" he asked, eyes still glued to the document in his hands.

"Vincent, would it be possible for me to get a job here?" Her voice softened as she approached his desk.

Bills were piling up for her. Despite the support Vincent had provided-both abroad and since she returned -she had drained her funds paying off the two men she'd once hired. Panic set in after hearing about Hannah's trip to the police, and she ended up spending even more to make sure those two men disappeared for good.

It wasn't until then that Vincent set his work aside, studying her with a puzzled look. "You have no plan to return to Bellavia?"

That idea was out of the question for her. With his divorce on the horizon, she planned to stay and finally take her place as his wife, "I'm not going back," she replied, shaking her head for emphasis.

"But I thought your stay in the city was temporary," Vincent insisted, his brow furrowed.

A little smile played on Brinley's lips. "Originally, I did mean to just take a break before going back. But it's warmer here than I remembered. Honestly, I don't want to leave anymore."
With her lashes lowered, a subtle shadow of sorrow crossed her features. "Years back, my mother remarried overseas. After she had my younger brother, she barely acknowledged me anymore. Whenever I'm unwell,I go to the hospital on my own. That house isn't a home. It's just empty and cold. I can't bear the thought of returning. If my father and brother were still around, they'd never let things get this bad for me."

A faint wave of sympathy flickered in Vincent's eyes. After a moment's pause, he spoke. "There's a subsidiary of Jones Group called Polaris Tech. I'll put you in charge of it. There's an apartment close by, and you can move in as soon as you'd like. Clive will see to all the details."

Brinley was caught off guard, surprise and happiness lighting up her face. He was practically handing her an entire company. That had to mean he truly cared for her. Her smile turned soft and grateful."Thank you,Vincent. I won't let you down."

"Good," he replied.

Uncertainty crept back into Brinley's voice as she asked, "What about Hannah? She did hire those men to harass me, but since nothing actually happened, maybe we can just let it go?"

Vincent redirected his attention to the papers in front of him. "I'll handle it."

A quiet nod from Brinley. "Thanks for everything, Vincent."

No sooner had she walked out than Vincent's phone buzzed with Derek's name on the screen. "Mr. Jones,those two guys who went after Miss Gilbert have already gone back to their hometowns. Should we keep tracking them down?"

"Don't stop. Keep investigating." Vincent pressed his fingers to the bridge of his nose, trying to stave off a headache.

After a pause, Derek said, "There's one more thing. When I dropped by your house for the files, Mrs. Jones asked about the suit jacket. I brushed her off with a white lie, but... Should I just buy her an identical one?"

A muscle jumped in Vincent's jaw as his gaze landed on the wedding ring glinting coldly on his hand."Boredom must really be getting to you," he replied, his tone icy enough to send a chill down the phone.

Clearly, that meant "no." Derek frowned. How was he supposed to answer Hannah if she asked again? He couldn't admit the jacket had been thrown away on Vincent's orders, could he?

After ending the call, Vincent's expression hardened, unreadable in the dim light. Was she seriously worried about another man's jacket?
###Chapter 36 Marital Assets


Lately, Vincent's late nights at the office had become routine, barely making it back home to rest. This was nothing new to Hannah. She'd grown accustomed to his absence due to work-related stuff years ago.

Over the next two nights, Hannah poured her energy into perfecting every detail of Sharon's upcoming birthday celebration. Drawing on a sense of nostalgia, she passed on Brinley's suggestions for lavish hotels and castle venues, opting instead to transform the Jones family estate into something magical. She didn't stop there. A carefully worded email went out to Sharon's favorite classicaI orchestra. Booking such a renowned ensemble was no small feat, but she figured it was worth a shot.

Meanwhile, the company had already pulled every flawed product from the shelves. With that hurdle cleared, her sights shifted to a new mission-developing a new line of women's personal safety devices. For her, nothing outranked the product development. Only by launching something reliable and innovative could she have the confidence to revisit the idea of collaborating with Miles.

Long before, her sonic earring design had become a national sensation, blending style with security. Their success had faded, though, as trends shifted and competitors multiplied.

Now, she brought every top mind in the company together, building a single powerhouse team focused entirely on the new product launch.

Most days found Hannah at her desk from sunrise until long after dark. Immersing herself in work was more than a habit. It was the only way to drown out everything else.

Late one evening, she finally returned home, just as the clock struck ten. A message blinked on her phone from the private detective-he had located the two men and paid them to speak the truth. He sent her a recording. She returned to her room, closed the door, and listened to it. Just as she had expected, both men confessed they had been hired by Brinley.

Hannah immediately texted him back. "Turn them over to the Dorbarrow police."

Lost in thought, she suddenly felt a presence at the doorway of her room and looked over. Beside the wide open door, Brinley stood there, arms folded and eyes glinting.

"The banquet's only days away, and you're still scrolling on your phone?" Brinley taunted, her voice thick with disdain.

Annoyance flickered across Hannah's face. "Hasn't anyone ever told you to knock before walking into someone else's room?"

A roll of her eyes was Brinley's only answer. "Why bother? Once I marry into this family, I'll have the run of the place. Doors won't matter."

Hannah met her gaze with a soft, unbothered laugh."Do not get ahead of yourself just yet. Last | checked,the title of Mrs. Jones still belongs to me."

"Mrs. Jones?" Brinley's laughter rang out, her gaze full of scorn."Do you actually believe you deserve that title? Vincent's been married to you for five years and has never once acknowledged you publicly, like you're just some mistress he tucked away. Not a soul sees you as his rightful wife. How pathetic."

Five years of being labeled as the"mistress" while she was actually Vincent's rightful wife had dulled the sting for Hannah. Brinley's barbs rolled right off; only someone naïve would think they could still wound her.

A calm reply slipped from Hannah's lips. "Pathetic? Look in the mirror, Brinley. You throw tantrums and spin little plots, but after all that effort, you're still standing on the sidelines. No wonder you're obsessed with pestering me, Vincent's real wife."

"You..." Color crept up Brinley's cheeks, though she smoothed her expression and flashed a smug grm."Here's something you might not know: Vincent just handed me the reins of one of the Jones Group's subsidiaries. Even gave me an apartment nearby."

Brinley paused to admire her flawless nails, smirking. "Meanwhile, what have you gotten in your five years as Mrs. Jones? He doesn't love you, and he sure doesn't appreciate your abilities."

Even though Hannah had endured so much, hearing thnat Vincent gifted Brinley a whole business made her chest tighten for a moment. He'd told her she didn't need a job, only to turn around and ggive Brinley an entire company. That old ache was quickly pushed aside-after all, divorce was on the horizon, and none of it really mattered anymore.

Composure returned to Hannah's face as she met Brinley's gaze. "It seems Vincent's been quite generous with you. All the more reason for you not to mess with me. If you push me too far, that shiny company and apartment might slip right through your fingers. So you'd better tread carefully around me."

An eye roll was Brinley's answer. "Since when did you get to dedicate the company and apartment Vincent had offered me?"

Matter-of-factly, Hannah replied, "They're part of the marital assets I share with Vincent. So yes,they absolutely concern me. If I decide I want them back, I have every right."

A sneer curled Brinley's lips. "You're heading for a divorce. What marital assets?"

Laughter bubbled out of Hannah. "That divorce agreement is still in my hands. Whether we split or not depends on my say-so. I'm the one in control, Brinley. Feel free to test me-see if I will kick you out of that apartment."
###Chapter 37 Shared A Bed


A glare full of venom shot from Brinley's eyes. "You shameless bitch!"

Unbothered, Hannah gestured toward the door."Say whatever you want. Now do us both a favor and leave my room."

A sharp retort from Brinley followed. "As if I'd stick around any longer than I have to. Sharon sent me to fetch you for dinner."

Before heading out, Brinley's eyes darted to Hannah's laptop screen. In that split second, something cold and vicious flickered in her face. She had overheard the recording on Hannah's phone just now.

Having realized Hannah was on her trail and actually gathering proof, Brinley's nails dug into her palms,anger simmering just beneath the surface. There was no way she'd let Hannah uncover the truth and turn the tables on her. Not a chance.

Hannah, oblivious to Brinley's scheming, was too busy to care. With days of skipped meals catching up to her, Sharon's invitation was as much about concern as family tradition. She closed her laptop and made her way downstairs.

The last thing Hannah expected was to see Vincent waiting at the table.

"If I hadn't called, would you have even bothered returning for dinner, Vincent?" A tired sigh escaped Sharon.

Vincent glanced up briefly, just long enough for his and Hannah's eyes to meet before both looked away."Work's been nonstop."

Sharon's patience was wearing thin. "Work demands your presence 24/7, huh? You can't even show your face at home. No wonder I still don't have a great-grandchild."

Vincent pressed his fingers to his temples. "Grandma, making a baby isn't that simple. It couldn't be rushed."

The response didn't soften her expression. "Time isn't on my side. When do you plan to try to have a baby with Hannah? After I'm dead and buried? I don't care what's on your schedule tonight. After dinner, you're going upstairs with Hannah."

Hannah's brow twitched. Sharing a bed with Vincent? Hell no.

Pulling Hannah closer, Sharon's tone gentled. "Sweetheart, I know you've been putting in long hours.Please, get some rest tonight. I just want what's best for you."

A hint of awkwardness colored Hannah's reply. "Alright."

Brinley, refusing to fade into the background, hurried over to Vincent and eagerly launched into a discussion about the subsidiary's affairs.

Every now and then, Vincent offered a suggestion or nodded along, giving her just enough attention.

All the while, Hannah kept her eyes on her plate, not saying a word as the conversation swirled around her.

Once dinner ended, Hannah wasted no time slipping away, drawn back to her laptop to finish up details for Sharon's birthday celebration.

Not long after, Vincent emerged from the shower, hair damp and water still clinging to his neck.He reached for the hairdryer and then eventually collapsed onto the bed without a word.

Sharon's insistence meant he was spending the night at home for a change.

With her work finished, Hannah slipped into the bathroom, showered, and climbed into bed, staking out the very edge of the mattress for herself.

That silence didn't last long. The bed dipped under Vincent's weight as he shifted closer, arms finding their way around her waist.

She stiffened and then wriggled free. "If you want sex, Brinley's room is upstairs."

"Don't move. Just let me hold you," he murmured, pulling her back into his arms. She smelled faintly of her citrusy body wash.

He sounded utterly exhausted. When it became clear she wouldn't break his grip, she stopped resisting.Soon,his steady breathing filled the silence-he had fallen asleep.

Pushing him away seemed pointless. With only two weeks left before the divorce, she figured there was no sense turning it into a war zone. Besides, exhaustion from work and party planning had kept her own sleep fitful at best. Eventually, she let herself relax and surrendered to sleep.
Morning arrived to find herself curled against Vincent's chest, one arm slung across his waist. His pajama shirt hung slightly open, a few buttons mysteriously undone.

Propping himself up, Vincent met her gaze. "Did you rest well?"

Without missing a moment, Hannah slid out of bed, her face unreadable. "You're not exactly winning points as a cuddle buddy. You're far worse than the male escorts I've hired."
###Chapter 38 Your FullMakeup Was For A Date...
A glimmer of satisfaction flickered in Hannah's eyes as Vincent's expression turned stormy. She turned on her heel and walked into the bathroom.



A meticulous makeup routine followed-foundation,blush, eyeliner, lipstick-each detail flawless. With a trip to the police station ahead, Hannah wasn't leaving anything to chance.



Spotting her reflection, Vincent straightened his tie and watched the pleased smile touch her lips. "Where are you headed today?" he asked quietly



Bright as day, Hannah met his gaze in the mirror."That's none of your concern."



In a flash of frustration, Vincent flung his watch onto the dresser, seized her wrist, and pressed her firmly against the vanity.



Without bothering to look up, Hannah tried to twist away from his grip, irritation in every movement.


"Why do you shy away from me? Is there something you're trying to keep from me?" Vincent pressed and tightened his grip on her.
His gaze lingered over her face. Her makeup only heightened her natural beauty. He was momentarily dazed and couldn't tear his eyes off her.


Sensing his brief distraction, Hannah wrenched free and scowled. "Quit grabbing me.I'mnotyour property."



A heavy silence hung in the air as Vincent reclaimed his watch. "Your lipstick's smeared," he said flatly


Once he left, Hannah checked her reflection again.Not a single flaw could be found-her lipstick was as perfect as before. Shrugging it off, she closed her compact and set it aside.



Hannah headed out, destination clear-the police station. Her statement was recorded, and a formal case was opened. Only one step remained: waiting for the authorities to summon Brinley for questioning.



Her next stop was the office. Brainstorming with her team, she floated the idea of a safety bracelet designed for women. While thoughts and sketches filled her mind, she reached for her phone,hoping to capture the inspiration.



Instead, a notification lit up her screen-Brinley had just posted on Instagram: "Four all-nighters later-finally done. Hope Sharon will love it."


In the photo, Brinley was holding onto a man's arm.
And with just one glance, Hannah recognized the owner immediately-it was Vincent's. Suddenly,the exhaustion Vincent had shown last night made perfect sense. He'd been busy helping Brinley with the banquet planning, not just with work.



A sharp sting shot through Hannah's palm as her nails dug in, her composure briefly faltering.



Pushing the phone aside, Hannah forced herself to focus on the meeting. She threw herself into work,staying long after everyone else had left.


At the end of the day, Felix insisted on driving Hannah home. She didn't refuse.



Chivalry came naturally to Felix. He opened the car door for her when they arrived.



A quiet "Thank you" escaped Hannah's lips. But as she stepped onto the driveway, Vincent's figure came into view, standing a few yards away, watching with cold intensity. His mood was unmistakably sour.



Hannah acted like she didn't notice Vincent's foul mood, waving as she said goodbye to Felix. Then,she turned to walk toward the house and taunted Vincent,not breaking her stride, "Switching careers to bodyguard now? I guess it suits you."


Vincent ignored the jibe and trailed her. Shadows darkened his features. "So the full face of makeup was for your date with another man?"


Darkness flashed in Vincent's eyes, displeasure etched in every line of his face.


Planting her feet, Hannah spun around and met his gaze,chin tipped up in challenge. "That's right. Got an issue with it?"



A scowl deepened across Vincent's brow. "Felix Wade.CEO of Nova Tech. Focuses on women's security gadgets.His company's hanging by a thread."



A spark of surprise flickered across Hannah's face as she faced him fully. "You really went out of your way to dig into him?"


Annoyance quickly replaced her surprise.


He sidestepped her question, letting his voice go icy."Is he the reason behind your desire for a divorce?Discarding me for a man about to lose his business?"



She replied instantly, "Felix has nothing to do with my request for a divorce."



A muscle tensed in Vincent's jaw. "You'd better mean your words. Because if he is the reason, I'll make sure his pathetic little company collapses by tomorrów."


A heaviness pressed on Hannah's chest. She leveled her voice. "Vincent, what's gotten into you? Felix hasn't crossed you."


"If I'm pissed off, then yeah, he has."


No words came as she stared at him, feeling the familiar wall of his stubbornness. "You..."



The silence stretched, thick and uneasy.



A passing gust lifted the hem of Hannah's pale green dress, the fabric trailing across Vincent's shoes.



Without a word, he slipped off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. "Wind's picking up. Let's go inside."



She didn't move, eyes downcast. "I'm not cold."


She then shrugged off the jacket. It slipped from her shoulders and fell to the ground.


Without a backward glance, Hannah walked ahead.


A lump formed in Vincent's throat. He opened his mouth but couldn't find the words.



Just then, his phone buzzed. He answered, voice like steel. "Talk."



Derek's words came quickly. "Mr. Jones, I've confirmed the harassment incident involving Miss Gilbert. It's real." After a brief pause, he added, "But it seems your wife might have something to do with it."
###Chapter 39 Video Leaked


Stepping down from the third floor, Brinley paused mid-step as Vincent's voice drifted from the hall,deep in conversation with his assistant.

Reacting instantly, she ducked behind a column and stayed out of sight, her ears straining to catch every word.Every detail of Vincent's exchange with Derek filtered through, reaching her ears.

Brinley allowed herself a smug smile. Cautious planning had paid off. The moment she discovered Hannah was investigating her, she'd made sure to payoff the two men who'd fled back to their hometown, coaching them to play along to fool Hannah's detective, only to change their story when giving their statements in the police station. A bundle of cash had easily bought their cooperation. Yet, Vincent's unexpected investigation sent a jolt of unease through her.

With quiet urgency, Brinley slipped back to her room, phone already in hand as she speed-dialed her favorite gossip reporter."Do it now. Release everything."

Without missing a beat, she called the police next. "I want to report a crime. Someone hired men to assault me."

By eight that night, the hashtag # CEO of Jones Group's First Love Harassed exploded across every social platform. Though the face in the video was blurry, anyone familiar with Brinley recognized her at a glance.

To summon the right tears, Brinley pinched her thigh until her eyes watered. The moment Vincent walked through the door, she rushed downstairs, cryingon cue.

Meanwhile, Hannah sat with Sharon in the living room, lost in quiet conversation.

Brinley burst in, voice trembling. "Hannah, do you hate me that much?" She made a beeline for Hannah and latched onto Hannah's hand.

A quick jerk freed Hannah's hand. Folding her arms, she met Brinley's accusation head-on. "Yes, I can't stand you. I don't have the energy to pretend otherwise."

Brinley raised her volume, tears streaming. "So you're admitting it, then?"

Confusion clouded Hannah's face as her brow furrowed. "Admitting to what?" Every instinct screamed this was another setup.

The commotion drew Danica over, her concern painted in worried lines. "Brinley, what happened? Why are you in tears?"

"Whatever it is, sit down and sort this out like civilized people." Sharon rapped her cane against the floor,her voice steady.

A deep crease furrowed Vincent's brow as he took in the tense exchange.

Before anyone else could speak, Brinley jumped in, voice trembling. "Sharon, I swear, causing drama was never my intention. It's just that Hannah can't stand me and even went out of her way to plot against me.Here,look for yourself."

Tears hidden behind one hand, Brinley showed her phone screen for the gathered crowd to see, the headline blaring.

Danica took one glance and went rigid. That was the exact same footage she'd glimpsed earlier on Hannah's phone. Eyes narrowed, she swung her glare to Hannah. "Did you leak the video to the press?"

Sharon, struggling to catch the thread of accusations, turned to Vincent for answers. "What video are they talking about?"

Eager to deliver proof, Danica started to hand the phone over, but Hannah moved faster, snatching it from her grip.

That move made Danica erupt. "What's your problem, Hannah?" Realization dawned a second later."1see what this is. You're scared. You don't want Sharon to see what kind of person you really are."

A spark of satisfaction danced in Brinley's eyes. With Danica fueling the conflict, she could simply stand back-her tears would do the rest.

Sharp words from Danica soured Sharon's expression. Sharon snapped,"That's enough, Danica. How could you accuse Hannah like that?"

Refusing to back down, Danica tried to push the issue. "Sharon, you don't know the half of it..."

A single icy look from Vincent silenced her instantly.

Hannah kept her focus on Sharon, her tone gentle and steady. "Please, don't worry. I'll handle this myself."
Sadness flashed across Sharon's face as she reached for Hannah's hand. "Tell me what's wrong,sweetheart. There's nothing to be afraid of. I'll help you-did Vincent hurt you?"

Hannah had married into the Jones family but was never publicly acknowledged due to her secret marriage to Vincent. Over the years, she had endured far too much. Sharon's heart ached for Hannah.

Hannah's vision blurred for a moment, touched by Sharon's concern. She had no intention of dragging Sharon into family squabbles, and she was just about to suggest Sharon go rest, when Brinley interjected with a trembling voice,it because I'm an outsider that you put your trust only in Hannah?" Tears shimmered in her eyes.
###Chapter 40 Cornered Without Proof


With a quiet tenderness, Sharon brushed a stray lock of hair behind Hannah's ear, ignoring Brinley's attempt to steal her attention.

At that moment, Vincent told the housekeeper, "Aubrey, please help Grandma upstairs so she can get some rest."

Sharon, however,planted her feet, defiance in her eyes. "You're trying to get rid of me because you really did do something to hurt Hannah, didn't you? Tonight, I'm staying put to make sure she gets the justice she deserves." A gentle cough punctuated her stubbornness.

Concern flashed across Hannah's face as she patted Sharon's back. "Don't worry about me. I'll be alright,really. Just go rest for a bit, please?"

Sharon's health was fragile. Hannah couldn't bear the thought of her being dragged into another stressful scene.

"Lies. Don't bother trying to send me away," Sharon insisted, her voice strained and her breath unsteady."I won't leave you alone-not when someone here might mistreat you."

Years of watching Hannah try to keep the peace with Danica had left a mark on Sharon. Even when Danica hurled the most awful words at Hannah, Hannah had never shown anything but a polite smile.

Seeing this, Danica's anger bubbled over. "This is all your fault, Hannah. Look how upset you've made Sharon!"

Ignoring the accusation, Hannah turned to Aubrey. "Please, just see that Sharon gets comfortable upstairs."Looking Sharon in the eye, she added softly,"1anything happens to you because of me, I'd never forgive myself. I promise, if I need help, I'll come straight to you. I'm right here. You'll hear if something's wrong."

Aubrey chimed in, "She's right. Please trust that she can handle the situation. And Mr. Jones is here. He won't let her be mistreated."

Sharon huffed, "Vincent is the one who's made things so difficult for Hannah." A finger pointed squarely at Vincent, her tone cutting. "Hannah is your wife. Don't you dare keep hurting her to please anyone else. Do you hear me?"
Brinley's face fell. She caught onto the insinuation immediately.

Vincent murmured, "I understand."

A gentle squeeze of Hannah's hand served as Sharon's goodbye, and finally, she allowed herself to be led upstairs. She knew that if she stayed and her health failed, it would only worry Hannah. Deep down, she recognized her limits-she couldn't shield Hannah forever. Marriage, after all, was something Hannah and Vincent needed to navigate together.

No sooner had Sharon left the room than Danica pounced, voice sharp. "Hannah, you honestly think Sharon's support is enough to sweep this under the rug? Get real. It won't. You owe Brinley an apology." She was sure Hannah was behind the video leak.

Hannah hadn't bothered glancing at the video. Her words were icy. "I have nothing to do with it."

"Only you had that video, Hannah. Who else could have leaked it?" Shrill and shaking, Brinley clung to Vincent's hand, tears streaking down her face."V/incent, now the world's seen me...Seen me harassed by two men. How am I supposed to live with that?"

Danica, all sympathy and outrage, dabbed away Brinley's tears."Don't you worry, sweetheart. We'll make sure Hannah pays for this."

A steely calm settled over Hannah. "Then show your evidence. If you're making accusations, at least present proof to me. Or is this how things are done now, shouting blame without a shred of evidence?"

That dismissive attitude sent Danica into a rage. "The only person with that video was you! Unless you're suggesting Brinley leaked that damn video herself? I know what's really going on: you're jealous that Vincent cares for her. You snapped and wanted payback. The Jones family shouldn't have let you marry in!"

Laughter, cold and humorless, escaped Hannah. "Bring me proof, or stop talking. Who gave you the right..."

She didn't get to finish. Vincent cut her off, his voice low and glacial. "Apologize."
###Chapter 41 The Police Showed Up


Vincent's eyes bore into Hannah, their intensity impossible to ignore. Derek had made it very clear over the phone-Brinley's harassment was somehow connected to Hannah. With the truth now on the table, there was no escaping the expectation-an apology was required.The Jones family prided itself on being just.

Confusion washed over Hannah. "Did I hear you right?"

Without hesitation, Vincent ordered, "Apologize to Brinley."

A quick spark of satisfaction lit up Brinley's face.

Danica couldn't hide her delight either.

"You actually doubt me?" Hannah's laugh was brittle. "You seriously think I leaked that video to the press?"

Unblinking, Vincent held her gaze. "This isn't only about the video. You owe her for what had happened at the club as well."

Standing tall behind Vincent, Brinley practicaly radiated victory. For her, Vincent's loyalty was a given.Now,he was proving it.

Pain seized Hannah's chest, and color drained from her cheeks. His accusations left deep marks, sharper than she expected. She had thought she'd built up enough scars to stop caring. Even so, Vincent's defense of Brinley still left her reeling.

Only after a long pause did Hannah find her voice again, quiet but determined. "Suppose I refuse. Then what?"

Disbelief crept into Vincent's voice. "You won't even admit to your own doing?"

Hannah's voice was cold as she met his stare."My own doing? You're already convinced I'm guilty without hearing my side of the story. I didn't do anything. And I won't admit to something I didn't do." Admitting to a crime she never committed made no sense at all.

Indifference filled Vincent's voice. "Derek has already investigated. Everything that had happened to Brinley at the club points straight to you."
Rather than defend herself any further, Hannah simply turned away and gave a low, humorless laugh.

Frustration broke through Danica's composure. "See for yourself, Vincent. Hannah won't even pretend to feel sorry!"

Tension in the air pressed in. With a gentle touch, Brinley reached for Vincent's sleeve, her words meant to solidify her gentle and forgiving image."Please, Vincent, there's no need to argue. Let's let this go. I'm not holding a grudge, now that everyone knows the truth. I just hope Hannah won't treat me like this again."

Vincent's scowl eased slightly. Brinley was always so understanding. Yet, the moment his eyes found Hannah again, they met nothing but quiet resistance. Firmness crept into his words. "No. I'm not letting this go."

For him,this was not an issue they could just brush aside. Hannah had to admit she was wrong.

Danica seized the moment."Exactly.Hannah owes Brinley an apology."

A harsh laugh escaped Hannah. "There's nothing for me to apologize for. If anyone should apologize, it's Brinley."

Lines of frustration appeared on Vincent's forehead. "Since when had you become like this?" He remembered a time when Hannah would own up to her mistakes. In his eyes, she had changed. Where was the woman who used to make things right after making some errors?

Hannah's gaze turned colder, sharper than before. Just like always, the moment she fell short of what he wanted, he dragged the past into the room and threw it in her face. "Nothing about me has changed. If you can't stand the person I am, then go ahead and divorce me. That way, you can finally be with your precious Brinley."

A dangerous glint flickered in Vincent's eyes as his jaw tensed, signaling the storm inside him.

Without warning, a piercing siren echoed from the street.

Into the room rushed a maid, breathless and wide-eyed. "Mr. Jones, the police are at thefront door."

A muscle in Vincent's jaw twitched as he shifted his gaze toward the hallway.

Excitement bubbled beneath Brinley's composed exterior. The police had made their entrance sooner than she'd hoped. Now Hannah had nowhere left to hide.
Feigning panic, Brinley clung to Vincent's arm. "Vincent, what should we do? I saw the video online and panicked. That's why I called the police. But now I'm worried... What if they arrest Hannah?"

Danica scoffed. "Why are you being so soft-hearted, Brinley? Let the police do their job. If Hannah gets locked up, it serves her right."

Vincent cast a look Hannah's way. Her composure held firm-she showed not the slightest hint of fear.

Within moments, the officers followed the maid into the foyer.

Brinley wasted no time stepping forward, voice trembling, eyes shining with practiced regret. "Officers, I'm so sorry. I want to take back my complaint. We settled everything. It was all a big misunderstanding. Please don't take Hannah away. I never meant for it to go this far."

Tears hovered on her lashes, her words quivering as if heartbreak weighed on her. Anyone watching might have believed Brinley and Hannah were lifelong friends.

Still, the police stayed detached. "Ma'am, please don't disrupt official proceedings."

One officer moved to the front. "We need to speak with Hannah Scott. Is she here?"

Before Hannah could utter a word, Vincent reached over and stopped her. Standing tall, he introduced himself. "I'm:her husband. If you have questions, direct them to me."
###Chapter 42 Weren't You Supposed To Arrest Hannah


Not hesitating for a moment, Hannah brushed off Vincent's hand and faced the officers. "I'm Hannah Scott."

Watching Vincent step in so quickly to protect Hannah, Brinley felt a twinge of annoyance. Still, she smothered her resentment and let a victorious smile settle in-what exquisite timing for the police to show up.

Danica looked like she could burst from delight. She even nudged Hannah with a playful push and said to the officers, "Yeah, that's her."

Hannah shifted slightly and locked eyes with Brinley, who shot her a challenging glare over.

One second, Brinley was smug, and the next, she transformed into a picture of nervous concern."Please,officers, don't take Hannah away. I've decided-I don't want to go through with pressing charges."

Danica, clearly displeased with this, raised her voice. "Oh, Brinley, why are you being so soft and forgiving?"

"If Sharon finds out about Hannah's arrest, she'll be upset." Mock defensiveness slipped into Brinley's tone as she clutched Vincent's hand. "Vincent, you have to do something. Please help Hannah."

A chill settled in Hannah's expression as she watched Brinley's performance. She knew Brinley couldn't wait to see her get taken away. As for Vincent, after what he'd just accused her of, she doubted he'd suddenly intervene for her.

"Ms. Scott, we'll need you to come with us," the officer remarked firmly.

Taking a steadying breath, Hannah nodded. "Alright. I'll cooperate."

Vincent stepped forward, gently patting her hand as a silent promise to stand by her side. "I'm going with her."

Noticing how Vincent held Hannah's hand, Brinley's expression chilled once more.

Panic flashed in Danica's eyes as she grabbed Vincent's arm. "Vincent, have you lost your mind? If the press finds out, it'll be a PR nightmare for the Jones Group!"

Vincent seemed ready to respond, but before he could say anything, Hannah calmly slipped her hand out of his grasp. Her voice was sharp and cold. "I don't need anyone to accompany me. I'm perfectly fine on my own. Officer, let's go."

Annoyance deepened the lines on Vincent's face as he watched her pull away with such distance. He hated that wall between them.

From the corner of the room, a second officer approached, a set of handcuffs ready in his hand.

Excitement flickered across Brinley's face. She could barely contain her joy at the thought of seeing those cuffs on Hannah's wrists.

But those cuffs never found their way to Hannah's wrists. A turn of events followed as the second officer addressed the group instead, "Can someone tell me which of you is Brinley Gilbert?"

Brinley stepped forward, confidence unshaken."That's me," she answered, thinking they might need her statement.

"Ms. Gilbert, you are now under investigation for encouraging harassment, manufacturing false accusations,and slander.Please come with us."

All color drained from Brinley's face."W-What do you mean?" This wasn't supposed to happen. Weren't the police after Hannah? A note of hysteria entered her voice. "There must be a mistake! I'm the one whofiled the report!"

The second officer said bluntly, "No mistake at all. After your complaint, we followed up and discovered clear evidence of your involvement. You fabricated events and framed Ms. Scott, seriously harming Ms.Scott's reputation. We have more than enough reason to bring you in."

Panic turned Danica's cheeks ashen. She hurried to Brinley's side and confronted the second officer."Wait,that can't be right! Weren't you supposed to arrest Hannah?"

The second officer's tone remained steady. "That was never the case. Ms. Scott reported what happened long before Ms. Gilbert did. After gathering the facts, it's clear Ms. Gilbert is responsible. She will be taken into custody."

Wild denial twisted Brinley's expression. "No! This is wrong! I didn't do any of it!"

Desperation sent Brinley searching for support. She turned to Vincent, but his attention never left Hannah.Grabbing for his sleeve, she begged, "Vincent, you have to believe me. I'm innocent-ths is a setup!"
Then, Brinley shot Hannah a glare full of accusation and fury.

One eyebrow raised, Hannah simply met Brinley's stare with a calm, unbothered challenge.Did Brinley really think she was the only one who would play games? Hardly.

Behind the scenes, Hannah had already brought in a private detective, keeping a close eye on every move.Once the news reached her that Brinley had tried to buy off those two men and shift the blame onto her,Hannah had wasted no time capturing the whole scheme on tape and passed the proof to the police. That decision was what set everything in motion and led to the scene unfolding now.

The officer moved to cuff Brinley.

With panic written all over her face, Brinley tried to back away. "No! I can't wear those! I haven't done anything wrong!"

Danica, unable to hide her outrage, blurted out, "You don't even have the facts straight! Why are you treating her like a criminal?"

A warning echoed in the officer's voice. "Please let us do our job. If you continue to interfere, we'll have no choice but to act."

In desperation, Brinley's gaze darted toward Vincent again. "Vincent, you have to trust me. I didn't do any of 计！＂	~

For a moment, Vincent's forehead creased. After a long breath, he placed a gentle hand on Brinley's shoulder, offering silent reassurance.

That small comfort seemed to settle Brinley, who stopped resisting as the cuffs were finally secured.

While the officers escorted her out, Brinley kept twisting around, eyes clinging to Vincent for some sign he would intervene.

Without delay, Danica gave Vincent a sharp nudge."Don't just stand there, Vincent. Go after her! There'sno way this isn't all a mistake. Brinley needs you-look at her!"

Vincent had just taken a step forward when a cold, scornful laugh escaped from Hannah. His jaw clenched as he paused for a moment. Then, without another word, he walked quickly after Brinley.
###Chapter 43 | Don't Want To Be Locked Up


Hannah stared blankly at the scene before her. For eight long years, she'd shared her life with Vincent.She once held onto the hope that pouring her heart into the relationship-never asking for anything in return-might be enough to win his affection.

But time had proven her wrong. All that loyalty and all those silent sacrifices had been wasted for nothing.What Vincent felt for her wasn't love. Whenever he looked her way, it was as though he was searching for someone else entirely.

And during her recent stay in the Jones estate, she'd bitterly felt that Vincent's attachment to Brinley stood out like a glaring spotlight. Every gentle word, every protective gesture, every ounce of his worry-he gave those to Brinley without hesitation.

Even when she faced the police, Vincent's concern had come off flat, as if he were reading lines from a script, putting on a show for appearances. His heart and worries always lay with Brinley, never her. She knew the truth now-Vincent wasn't incapable of love. He just didn't love her.

That realization had settled in Hannah's chest like an old bruise-painful at first, but eventually numb from the constant heartbreak.

A sharp pinch from Danica pulled Hannah back to the present.

"I always suspected you were the one behind this, Hannah. Framing Brinley just to get her locked up? That's quite vicious." Danica's glare sharpened as she snarled, "Did you really think this would drive a wedge between Brinley and Vincent? Dream on!"

Hannah winced from the pain and shot Danica a cold glare. "Rather than raising your voice at me, why don't you put that energy into finding a way to get Brinley out of jail?" Not backing down, she stepped forward,her tone steady and biting. "With charges like these, people can get locked away for at least a year, you know."

"You!" Danica's anger boiled over. She lifted her hand, ready to strike.

Lightning-fast, Hannah caught her wrist mid-swing and arched an eyebrow. "Did you really think I'd let you lay a hand on me again?"
A rough shove sent Danica stumbling backward, nearly losing her balance as she tried to recover.

Rage sent Danica's breath coming in sharp, ragged bursts as she fought to steady herself.

Without a second glance, Hannah strode toward the officers waiting forher, paying no attention to Danica's angry protests echoing behind her.

···

Brinley sat in the stark police station, searching for a loophole, grasping for any explanation that might clear her name. However, each denial sounded less convincing as the officers calmly presented their findings.

Still, Brinley refused to admit to her crime. "It wasn't me! That audio has to be doctored. I've never spoken those words. And why would I pay someone to assault myself?"

She clung to denial, refusing to budge an inch. The officers had grown tired of arguing, so they decided it was time for Brinley to meet the accomplices face-to-face.

The instant the two men entered, emotions flickered in their eyes. One of them grabbed her hand and begged, "Miss, please, get us out of here. We can't go to prison!"

Brinley shrank back, her eyes fixed on the floor. "I... I have no idea who you are."

Suddenly, one man's expression hardened. "You lying bitch! You were the one who told us to grope you,and now you're pretending you don't know us? If we're going down, you're coming with us!"

With a wild gesture, Brinley tried to shield herself. "Get them out of here! I swear, I've never met them in my life!"

As the men's emotions spun out of control, the officers had no choice but to separate them from Brinley.

Vincent stood off to the side, silent, but the lines across his forehead only deepened.

Desperation filled Brinley's voice. "They're framing me! I don't know them! They're the real criminals!"

One officer, unfazed, replied in a steady voice, "We've collected physical evidence and witness accounts.Right now, everything points straight to you."

Brinley avoided their eyes, panic flickering in her gaze.

The officer added, "You accused Ms. Scott of hiring someone to assault you, but in truth, you set up the entire thing yourself just to frame Ms. Scott. The charges are defamation and damaging someone's reputation. If this sticks, you could be facing a year behind bars. You may want to tell us the truth while you still have the chance."

Shock rooted Brinley to the spot. "What do you mean?" Her first instinct was to cling to Vincent's sleeve."Vincent, I'm begging you. Don't let them do this to me!"

The officer didn't even flinch. "Ms. Gilbert, pleading with others won't change your situation. The next step depends on the victim's wishes." He shifted his attention to Hannah."Ms. Scott, you're at the center of this.Do you want to reach a settlement, or would you rather press charges and see this through in court?"

"A settlement?" Hannah's gaze swept over to Brinley, and a chilling smnile touched her lips. "Absolutely not.An apology won't cut it either. I want Brinley Gilbert to be held accountable."

As she uttered the last sentence, she shifted and looked into Vincent's eyes.

Though Vincent said nothing, a faint shadow crossed his features.

Hannah noticed the tension right away. Clearly, Vincent wasn't thrilled about her answer. Still, she refused to let his feelings sway her. Back when she was wronged, she had no one on her side-only a chorus of accusations. This time, she wouldn't bend just because someone else didn't like her choice. She would demand her own justice, and she wouldn't back down.

Tears streamed down Brinley's face. "Vincent, please, I don't want to be locked up..."
###Chapter 44 He Pled On Brinley's Behalf


Vincent's features clouded over, tension gathering between his brows.

No reassurance came from Vincent, leaving Brinley cold with uncertainty. She took one last desperate chance. "Vincent, you don't believe me?"

A wall of silence met her plea. Vincent's eyes revealed nothing, his thoughts locked away.

Catching a glimpse of his profile, Hannah searched for a clue, but his expression stayed closed off.

Dread pooled in Brinley's stomach. Did this mean Vincent was giving up on her? Her voice cracked as she called out, "Vincent... Please..."

Authority rang through the officer's voice."Ms. Gilbert, you are sentenced to administrative detention.You'll be held for fifteen days."

No sooner had the officer spoken than two more approached to take Brinley by the arms.

Clutching her chest, Brinley gasped for breath. "Vincent, I can't breathe... My heart-it really hurts..."

Without warning, she crumpled to the floor.

Chaos erupted as everyonescrambled toward her.

Quick to react, Vincent swept her into his arms, voice shaking as he screamed, "To the hospital! Now!"

Never before had Hannah seen him look so utterly frantic. The fear in his eyes was a revelation.

In that moment, Hannah understood what set love apart from indifference. No tears came-she only pressed her lips together, numb as she observed the scene unravel.

A few minutes later, she finished her final statement and slipped out of the police station alone.

···

Flashing red lights carried them to Dorbarrow Hospital, where Brinley was whisked into emergency care.

The attending physician shot Vincent a hard stare. "She has a serious heart condition. Don't you know that?
Another two minutes, and we could've lost her."

Vincent stood as if turned to stone. He tried to process it. Brinley had been living with a heart condition all along? Suddenly, her previous words of being sick with no one by her side when she was abroad flashed back to his mind. So, she'd been plagued by this serious illness?

The doctor's tone left no room for argument. "You must protect her from any emotional distress. Her heart can't handle much more. You need to keep her calm at all times."

With a few more instructions rattled off, the doctor stepped away, leaving Vincent reeling.

Vincent lingered by the doorway, memories pulling him backward. He could see himself as a boy of seven,watching from the shore while the ocean claimed both Brinley's father and her brother. He could barely breathe as waves of self-reproach, remorse, and sorrow rose and fell, making it hard to stand his ground.

Hours slipped by while he stayed rooted there, lost in that tide of emotion.

When daylight finally crept through the blinds, Brinley woke and found Vincent right by her side. She struggled to speak. "Vincent, I-"

Vincent stopped her before she could say more. "Why did you keep your heart condition from me? This is serious. You should have told me."
2
She muttered, "I just didn't want you to worry. Most of the time, it's not so bad. As long as I stay calm, I can live a normal life."

His voice carried more weight than usual. "Heart disease isn't something to brush off. I'm calling a specialist. You're getting a more detailed reassessment, and we'll set up a treatment plan that works."

Her eyes flickered, and unease crept in. She hastily stopped him. "Please don't make me go through with that, Vincent. I don't want any treatment. I don't want to be separated from you. My father and brother are already gone... What if I don't survive the surgery?" Tears slipped down her cheeks.

Vincent's resolve softened as he watched her cry. "Then focus on feeling better for now. If things get worse,have a specialist check on you."

A bit of relief flickered across Brinley's face as she agreed. "Alright." Her fingers trembled as she reached for his, "Vincent, please believe me-l was set up. I really don't know those two men. I would never do anything to damage my own name."
He hesitated and then gently pulled away. "Let me handle this. You just concentrate on getting better."

A faint smile crossed her lips. "Alright. I promise, I'Il take care of myseIf. You don't have to worry."

Vincent offered a quiet nod, not quite meeting her eyes. When he finished giving her a few last reminders,he left her to rest.

Not long after, Derek sent Vincent a message. "Mr. Jones, should we keep digging?"

Vincent sent a quick reply. "Stop. That's enough."

Vincent knew sorting out Brinley's situation meant he had to begin with Hannah. His first move was to call her.


Meanwhile, at home, Hannah was focused on finalizing details for Sharon's birthday party plan. The moment Vincent's name appeared on her phone, she hit decline without missing a beat. A second call came through,but she rejected it again, just as quickly. Her solution to his ongoing calls was to silence her phone altogether.

Minutes later, Vincent stormed back and appeared at her doorway, his patience frayed. "Why wouldn't you answer me?"

"I just didn't want to." Hannah didn't even look up from her work.

He leaned against the frame of the doorway, exhaustion dragging at his features. His words were strained from lack of sleep. "We need to talk."

Her eyes flickered with annoyance. "What is there left to say? It's about Brinley, isn't it?"

With less edge in his tone, Vincent tried to reason with her. "She's already admitted she made a mistake."

Hannah rolled her eyes. Of course, it was about Brinley. A humorless chuckle escaped her. "What,now she needs you to apologize on her behalf?"

Vincent didn't respond to the jab, choosing instead to cut to the chase."L_et's just drop this whole thing."
###Chapter 45 He Stepped In For Her


"Drop this whole thing?" Hannah snapped her laptop shut. "Not a chance. Whatever happens between you and Brinley is none of my business. But after what she did, twisting the facts and dragging my name through the mud, I'm taking this as far as it needs to go. If it calls for prosecution, then so be it."

Vincent worked at the knot of his tie, his eyes cool. "I'll make it up to you. You've been eyeing my mother's properties, right? I'll get them for you. I don't care how many units you want."

A short, dry laugh slipped from Hannah. "How generous of you."

She had to admit Brinley really was Vincent's irreplaceable first love-no amount of money was too much if it meant protecting her.

With arms crossed, Hannah shook her head. "I'm not interested in money or those properties."

Vincent's frown deepened as her refusal hung in the air. "My mind's made up," he said, his words leaving no room for argument. "I'll have the charges withdrawn in your name."

"Don't you dare!" Hannah hadn't expected him to be so high-handed about it.

"I have .Derek handle it. This ends now." With that, Vincent turned and left.

But Hannah had no intention of letting it slide. She compiled all the evidence and submitted it directly to the court.

Not long after, Brinley, still lying in a hospital bed, received the court's official summons. All color drained from her face, shock written plainly in her eyes.

Danica breezed in right then to check on her. Seeing Brinley's stricken look, she hurried to the bedside."Brinley, are you feeling worse? Is your heart acting up?"

Trembling,Brinley held out the paper, tears smudging the ink. "Mrs. Jones, look what Hannah's done. She's determined to ruin me."

Outrage flashed across Danica's face. "She's actually suing you? She has no shame!"

Determined to help, Danica flattened the court summons on the table and reached for her phone. "Give me a second. I'll send this to Vincent right away. He needs to know how Hannah's treating you."

Masking her glee, Brinley pressed her lips together. "Maybe we shouldn't let Vincent know about this."

"You always take the gentle route, Brinley. Sometimes I wish you wouldn't," Danica said.

A moment later, Danica tapped her phone, sending the snapshot of the court summons straight to Vincent.

Brinley felt a rush of satisfaction-just a few tears and a few words, and someone was already fighting for her.

Vincent's call came through almost at once.

With a slight smile, Danica tilted the phone so Brinley could see. "Look at that. He called the second he saw the message."

Happiness crept across Brinley's face.

Without missing a beat, Danica picked up. Vincent's voice carried through the speaker. "How's Brinley doing?"

Danica wasted no time. "Here, you can speak to her yourseIf," she said, passing the phone to Brinley.

Brinley took the phone without hesitation.

His concern was obvious as he asked, "Is your heart still hurting?"

"Not anymore," Brinley answered instantly. "I just got that court summons, and it rattled me a little."

"Leave it to me. I'll take care of everything," Vincent remarked, his tone gentle.

"Thank you, Vincent," she replied softly.

Meanwhile, at the Jones Group headquarters, Vincent hung up and instantly dialed Hannah's number.

This time, she picked up almost instantly.

"She's gotten the court summons, I take it?" Hannah's voice was almost breezy.

"Areyou really going through with this lawsuit?" Vincent asked.

Her answer didn't waver. "I am." After a pause, Vincent finally spoke, quieter this time. "Brinley's health isn't good. She's got a heart condition."


For a moment, silence stretched between them before Hannah found her voice again. "Vincent, if being sick was all it took to avoid facing the consequences, this world wouldn't be able to uphold justice. She dragged my name through the dirt first-don't I get to defend myself? Her health isn't my responsibility. Just because she's fragile doesn't mean I owe her mercy. If you're hoping I'll let it go out of pity, then I'm afraid I can't do that."

Unwavering and cool, her tone never slipped. She ended the call without hesitation right after.

Having resolved the legal matter-at least for the moment-Hannah felt lighter. Turning her attention to business, she began chatting with event organizers about Sharon's birthday banquet. In the middle of their conversation, her phone buzzed with unexpected news-the court had tossed out her case.

Stunned, she called to ask for answers-only to learn that Vincent had interfered. Anger boiled over, and she fired off a message to him. "You shameless bastard."

She started reaching out to courts in other regions, hoping one might hear her out. But every single one turned her away, calling the case "exceptional" and refusing to take it on. It was obvious now. Vincent was shielding Brinley from the consequences.

Hannah lowered her phone, her energy drained and her hope running low. With Vincent in the picture, there was no way Brinley would ever be prosecuted.

Hannah shifted her approach. She sent Vincent another message."1fyou want me to drop the lawsuit, fine.But Brinley has to post a public apology. Put it online where everyone can see. Do that, and I'll step away.lf not, I'll keep filing. Every single day. I've got time, and I'm not afraid to use it. And if the media catches wind of this-let's see who ends up being publicly disgraced."

Vincent didn't reply.

Later, as Hannah scrolled through Instagram, something caught her eye and made her freeze. Brinley had posted again-just one minute earlier.

The post had three photos. A man in a suit, seen from behind; a hand pointing toward him; a massive bouquet of red roses. The caption read, "The man I love came to see me again. And he brought me these beautiful flowers."
###Chapter 46 You Think You've Won


Seeing Brinley's post, Hannah understood now. No wonder Vincent hadn't responded to her message. He had been with Brinley in the hospital all along. No surprise there. The instant his precious first love ran into trouble, the legendary CEO turned into her savior. He dropped everything to rush to her side,taking care of every little detail himself.

Then, Hannah's mind shifted to her own miscarriage. Back when she lost their baby, Vincent hadn't visited her in the hospital even once. She could taste the bitterness, but she forced herself to swallow it. It was fine.She didn't want a man like him anymore anyway. A smirk, sharp and icy, flickered across her lips.

Just then, Felix sent over several documents.

Hannah steadied herself and threw all her focus into the task in front of her. The hours passed without making a sound. When she finally glanced up, her screen lit up with call after call she hadn't noticed until now. All of them were from Vincent. Predictable. Any threat to Brinley sent him spiraling.

Her ringtone cut through the silence. She answered, taking her time,"Well? Have you made up your mind?"

She kept her tone steady as she continued, "I want Miss Gilbert's public apology at eight o'clock tonight.Don't be late."

A faint,pleading voice drifted through the speaker. Brinley's. "Vincent..."

So they were still together. Hannah's finger hovered over the hang-up button, but then Vincent's voice interrupted, low and edged with warning. "Hannah."

Hannah let out an impatient sigh. "What is it now?"

"Brinley has a heart condition. Don't provoke her again."

Rolling her eyes, Hannah let out a chuckle. "Vincent, maybe you should save your advice for your precious Brinley. If she's truly unwell, she'd do better focusing on her health instead of popping up in my life."

Then, she ended the call, not giving him a chance to respond. She lamented that she should have hung up the second he uttered her name.

After reviewing Felix's documents, inspiration struck Hannah. If they were moving forward with a smart bracelet for women, why not center it around hormone monitoring? Giving women the tools to trulyknow their own bodies felt like the right direction. She immediately shared this idea to Felix.

Not pausing for a moment, Hannah turned her attention to planning Sharon's upcoming birthday bash.

From the way the estate would be arranged, to the playlist for the string quartet, to the color of the invitation borders and the style of each floral brooch, Hannah's eye made sure every last detail was flawless. There were just twelve days left before she walked away from Vincent's life altogether. In these final days at the Jones estate, she.was determined to give Sharon a birthday she'd never forget.

Right on the dot at 8 p.m., Brinley's public apology went live on every platform, reaching Hannah.

Since the law couldn't hold Brinley accountable, Hannah decided to let public opinion take over.

Brinley's so-called apology barely qualified. She tagged Hannah and wrote, "Sorry." She didn't bother with an explanation, skipped any context, and refused to admit to anything. That single word seemed to be all she felt was required.

Feeling triumphant, Brinley dropped a message into Hannah's inbox. "Hannah, do you really think you've won?"

Hannah didn't reply. She took a screenshot and reposted Brinley's apology with it attached. The caption read,"?"

Vincent chimed in almost immediately underneath, posting the same cryptic symbol,"?".

Vincent was obviously jumping in to shield Brinley, but Hannah paid him no mind.

Before long, their little showdown lit a fire under social media, and #JonesGroup climbed straight into the trending charts.

Nothing drew attention quite like a scandal among the rich, and people everywhere were hooked.

Word spread like wildfire once people began poking around. Suddenly, everyone was caught up in the chaos -Vincent's first love and his current"mistress" were apparently locked in a public tug-of-war over him. The gossip mill couldn't get enough, spinning tales about his tangled relationships and the drama swirling between these two women.

Yet, sharper eyes quickly pieced together what was really going on. As it turned out, Vincent's first love had gone so far as to fake a harassment scene and aimed to throw the blame on his "mistress."
And that "mistress" wasn't one to take things lying down. The moment trouble surfaced, she'd marched right over to the police and filed a report.

As a result, the first love had been forced into the awkward spotlight, making a public apology. There was no real remorse,though. She'd typed out a single"sorry" and left it at that. The "mistress" had decisively decided to share the smug private message she'd received for every netizen to see.

Before long, the internet erupted. Brinley's apology post exploded, racking up over half a million comments,and the vast majority were scathing.

Faced with a flood of backlash, Brinley disabled the comments in frustration.

On the flip side, Hannah's repost turned into a rallying cry. Support poured in from every corner. People called hertotal inspiration" and "the queen who never settles for less." Her follower count skyrocketed by more than half a million.

One comment shot to the top: "Ditch Vincent already! Come to me instead. I've got energy, looks, and I'll never let you down in any way."

That comment had Hannah cracking up, so she dropped a like on it.

Meanwhile, sitting inside the Bentley, Derek scrolled through the flood of comments, a grin tugging at his lips.

Vincent slid into the car just then. The grin on Derek's face did not go unnoticed. "What's so funny?"Vincent asked, keeping his tone even.

"You have to see this. The comment section of your wife's repost is something else today," Derek said,holding his phone out with a little flourish.

With just one glance, Vincent immediately caught the comment that Hannah had just liked.

Before Vincent could really focus on it, Derek's finger kept flicking the screen, moving past that top comment.


"Go back," Vincent said, his words sharp,

Flustered, Derek nodded. "Right away."

Hannah's like had pushed that comment to the top, making it impossible to miss.
Vincent's eyes narrowed, his whole expression turning cold in an instant.

Sensing the shift, Derek slipped his phone away and scrambled to buckle up. He cleared his throat and asked with caution, "Should we go see Miss Gilbert at the hospital now?"
###Chapter 47 You'd Really Dump MeFor Someone Like That
"Go home." Vincent's tone was as cold as ever.


Derek grumbled silently to himself. Vincent practically lived at the hospital these days, and people might start thinking he'd moved in for good.


Right then, Vincent's phone buzzed. Brinley's name flashed on the screen. He picked up without delay."Vincent..." Her voice shook, barely holding it together. "Everyone online is tearing me apart. I can't handle this. I'm not the villain they make me out to be."


Vincent could hear her quick, shallow breaths through the line. His voice grew gentler. "Try to stay calm.I'll handle it."


A tiny, broken plea slipped out. "Will you still visit me?"
 "I'll see you tomorrow." He offered a few more comforting words before ending the call. He then pressed his fingers to the bridge of his nose, trying to focus. "Derek, leak some juicy celebrity news to the press. Distract them from Brinley. And start filing lawsuits against anyone posting defamatory comments."


Unable to read Vincent's expression, Derek quietly responded, "Got it."


Vincent cracked the window, letting the wind in. The breeze cleared his head, if only a little.


Back at the Jones estate, Hannah finished up her work around ten and slipped away to the bathroom for a shower.


Stepping out of the bathroom wrapped in just a towel, Hannah froze, her heart skipped a beat.Vincent stood there, leaning against the doorframe,as silent as a shadow.


"So, you finally decided to leave the hospital?" she said, her voice laced with sarcasm. She hadn't seenI him at home for three days, but she'd seen his face plastered all over Brinley's social media every single day.


"I camne straight from work," Vincent replied, his tone as chilly as ever.


Hannah just shrugged, her words flat. "Oh." She couldn't care less where he returned from.


Vincent's gaze sharpened. "What's with those comments online?"



Hannah blinked. So, he'd shown up just to confront her over the screenshot she'd shared of Brinley's private message. Naturally, he showed up to defend Brinley.


Hannah's jaw tightened. "You've seen it. Was there any point coming all this way just to ask?"


Yes, she'd posted that screenshot deliberately.Making Brinley feel utterly humiliated was exactly what she wanted. So what if it was petty?


Vincent's hand shot out, catching her at the waist,
 his expression impossible to read. "You were serious?"



She tried to break herself free, knee flying up in a sharp warning, but he dodged and trapped her,pressing his leg between hers.


"Damn right I was." Hannah shot back, refusing to back down. It seemed Brinley had him completely wrapped around her finger. All it took was one post,and he was storming back, ready to pick a fight on her behalf.


The longer Hannah stared at Vincent, the more she felt sick to her stomach.



"Young, energetic, won't let you down in any department?' Is that really your type? You'd really dump me for someone like that?" Vincent's jaw clenched as his mind flashed back to the top comment he'd seen online.



"What are you talking about?" Hannah blinked in confusion.Then it hit her-he must've seen the top comment she'd liked on that post. So he wasn't here to defend Brinley afer all?


Hannah's mind whirled, her irritation momentarily replaced by confusion.


While she was still piecing things together, Vincent suddenly leaned down and bit her on the collarbone,almost as if to punish her. "You're trying to drive me insane," he said, voice low and rough.


"Ow!" Hannah hissed, pressing her hands against his chest to create some distance. "Are you insane?"


She fought to break free, twisting in his embrace.


But Vincent wasn't about to let her go. With one swift motion, he pinned her wrists above her head,the cool metal of his cufflinks pressing into her skin.


She jerked back instinctively, trying to put space between them.


But Vincent wasn't finished. Hle grabbed her by the waist and lifted her, setting her down on the vanity. "Vincent, what do you think you're-" Her protest was cut short as he crashed his mouth onto hers, the kiss hard and possessive.


He bit down on her lower lip until shetasted blood,the sharp tang spreading between them.


That was enough. Hannah shoved him off with all her strength, wiping her lips and shooting him a look of disgust. "If you want sex, go crawl back to Brinley.Get the hell away from me!"
 
###Chapter 48 Just Divorce Me Already
A dark storm gathered in Vincent's eyes. "Don't bring up Brinley," he snapped, voice as cold as ice. The warning in his tone was unmistakable. "She would never speak to me the way you do."


Only silence followed until Hannah broke it with a bitter, mocking laugh, retreating a step. "If that's the case, go to her. What's the point of coming boack here at all?"



Vincent's expression tightened, lines deepening between his brows. "Is it really necessary for you to talk like this?"


Sharp defiance glinted in Hannah's eyes. "I've always talked like this. If you can't take it, just divorce me already."


A look of fury flashed across his face. "How many times do I have to tell you? Don't bring up divorce again."
He studied her, noticing the way she seemed fixated on ending things lately.


Turning away, Hannah made it clear she was done arguing.


A flick of his cuffs signaled his impatience as he shifted topics. "What you did with Brinley-don't let it happen again. Your post could make her condition worse."



Arms folded, Hannah's laugh was hollow and sharp.She had just believed he wasn't here to defend Brinley. How foolish of her. Of course, everything came back to Brinley. That was always the reason.Vincent had only come home to defend Brinley. The truth stung-to him, she was just a stand-in, never the real thing.


Anger twisted inside Hannah, threatening to spill over. Why did she have to suffer just because Brinley was sick?



A hard, unflinching smile broke across Hannah's face. "Vincent, let's get one thing straight. Brinley apologized to me. And what I say in response to that apology is none of your business."


A muscle in Vincent's jaw jumped, his eyes darkening further."And you had to pick a fight with her on the internet?"



"Think whatever you want," Hannah replied, voice icy. His disapproval was obvious, but she didn't care.She wasn't going to back down.


Tension pressed in from all sides until Vincent's phone abruptly began to ring.


A sideways glance from Hannah caught the name flashing on the screen-Brinley.


Without a second's hesitation, Vincent answered,his tone softening instantly. On the other end, Brinley's sweet, trembling voice complained of feeling unwell and wanting to see him as soon as possible.


Vincent glanced at Hannah.


Hannah nodded as she thought she got his message.

She started to walk out of the room.
But abruptly, Vincent stepped in before she could go any farther. He grabbed her wrist, refusing to let her slip away. She pulled and twisted, trying to break loose, but his grip held firm.


Left with no choice, Hannah endured the next thirty minutes listening to Vincent's low, soothing words as he comforted Brinley-every phrase another twist of the knife.


When the call ended, Hannah finally managed to wrench her arm away with force. Rubbing the angry red mark on her wrist, she glared at him. "Whatever goes on between you and Brinley is your business.I don't care."



Vincent's gaze flicked to her wrist, now visibly red.A brief shadow crossed his face. Silence hung for a moment before his voice dropped to something almost gentle. "Delete that post."


Hannah blinked, taken aback. Was he really asking this now?



Stern lines deepened around Vincent's mouth. "I just But abruptly, Vincent stepped in before she could go any farther. He grabbed her wrist, refusing to let her slip away. She pulled and twisted, trying to break loose, but his grip held firm.

Stern lines deepened around Vincent's mouth. "I just got word-Brinley's heart rate spiked because of the comment section of your post. If anything happens to her, you'll be the one to blame. Delete the post."


A defiant spark lit in Hannah's eyes. "No. I won't delete it," she replied, voice steady and strong. This was justice she fought for-no way in hell was she backing down now.


Vincent's jaw tightened. "Brinley has already apologized. Isn't that enough for you?"


"Not nearly enough," Hannah replied, folding her arms tightly. "A single apology won't fix what she did."



A thick silence grew between them, bristling with resentment.



Then, without warning, Vincent lunged forward and snatched her phone right off the vanity.


Hannah darted forward, voice sharp. "What do you think you're doing?"


But he had the height advantage. One arm easily held her back as he unlocked her phone with practiced ease. Within seconds, he located the post and deleted it without hesitation.


The phone was thrust back into her hand, his words cutting and final. "It's gone."


For a moment, Hannah was too stunned to move.Then,fury overtook her, and she kicked him hard in the shin. "You had no right! That wasn't yours!"


Rage made her whole body shake as she struggled to catch her breath.


Vincent's eyes slid away, his tone flat and distant."This ends now."


Calm on the surface, his words sliced right through her.


Refusing to break, Hannah tipped her head back,willing the tears not to fall-not ove him.


A tense swallow was the only sign of his discomfort.After a heavy pause, he said, "I'll transfer the Lakeshore Villa into your name."
"Like I want it," she replied. Her voice was cool,detached.


Turning away, she made for the door-but Vincent's grip landed on her wrist again. "It's settled, then."


No room for argument lingered in the air. The meaning was clear: this was nothing more than a transaction. Another attempt to solve everything with money.


That was always Vincent's way-gift-wrapped solutions, money in place of real apologies. Once, it had been jewelry or handbags. Now, it wasproperty,meant to buy Hannah's silence about Brinley.


Weariness replaced the anger in Hannah's chest. If this was how he wanted to end things, by paying her off, she'd take it. After everything, he owed her at least that much. She drew herself up, eyes fierce and unyielding. "Then make it cash. I want nothing with your name on it."


A tug at his loosened tie was his only reaction."Fine."
No further words passed between them as Vincent walked out the door, destination obvious.


She knew exactly where he was going. But she didn't have the energy to care. He always sought Brinley out.


A glance at her phone showed the hour: midnight.Eleven days remained. After that, she would leave his world entirely.
###Chapter 49 A Photo Of Them Kissing
Once Hannah slipped into her pajamas, she clicked into the legal documents her attorney had emailed,diving into every page with a careful eye. She had asked for legal advice specifically regarding her dispute with Brinley.


Just as she was fully absorbed in the document,her phone buzzed with breaking news alerts.


"Jones Group Files Massive Lawsuit-Is All for the Sake of a First Love?"



"Major Twist-CEO's Alleged Mistress Erases Her Post in Shame?"



Hannah couldn't quite describe the feeling that rose in her chest. Numb, she tapped into the sea of comments below the headline.



Only two hours back, a swarm of strangers had come to her defense. But now, those same voices hurled insults. They called her shameless. Labeled her a gold digger. Accused her of chasing wealth just for appearances.


Nothing about their judgment fazed Hannah. Worse had been said right to her face by people in Vincent's circle.



Back on the trending tab, she saw that every trace of her spat with Brinley had quietly disappeared. No wonder Vincent was so eager to compensate her.The villa offer and the sudden generosity all served one purpose: smoothing things over for this moment.



Laughter sat on the edge of her lips, but no sound came. Scrolling further, she spotted a grainy paparazzi photo-Brinley and Vincent, caught in a kiss.



Even with her heart locked away, Hannah felt it stumble. Time and again, Vincent had claimed there was nothing between him and Brinley. Still, one look at that intimate photograph was enough to unravel every assurance he'd given.
Suddenly, it all made sense-why V/incent insisted on keeping their marriage under wraps. He had always loved Brinley. He only ever wanted to go public with Brinley. Being the secret spouse meant she was never meant for the spotlight. She was the hidden ###Chapter.Easily erased.


Without a word,Hannah pressed save on the photo.


Throughout the night, sleep refused to come, no matter how many times she closed her eyes.


Maybe it was the flood of posts and comments she'd read. Old memories mingled with fresh wounds,dragging her mind back to her earlier days with Vincent. While she'd been the understudy in his story, there had been sweet moments.


The night Vincent proposed, he had transformed a glass conservatory with a sea of yellow roses-her favorite.


There had been a time when he'd mark her calendar,cancel business flights across the world,simply because she begged him to stay. He'd pull her close,
pressing his palms to her aching stomach and trying to soothe the pain.


Six months into their marriage, they had moved into their new home, Lakeshore Villa, miles from the Jones family estate, all to protect her from Danica's spite. At the doorway, Vincent had remarked, "This is our home." That simple line... It was the most heartfelt thing he'd ever said to her.


During the first year in their new home, he'd bring her fresh flowers every night he came home.She'd saved most of them, letting them dry until they became keepsakes of something gentle.


Spare hours had brought spontaneous tripS-snowfall in winter, shimmering lakes in summer.


In moments of passion, he'd pull her close, call her "baby" or "Anna," and insist on exploring every way they could be close.


Unfortunately, happiness had slipped away far too soon. Vincent's schedule had grown increasingly packed, and his presence at home had gradually become a rare occurrence.


There were days when Hannah searched every room,only to discover he was gone. Maybe that was when Brinley came back into the picture. Perhaps that was when Vincent's attention drifted for good. The substitute had served her purpose, and he was done pretending.


Looking back, Hannah could only taste the ache of old memories. Maybe the only reason he'd ever treated her well was because he saw someone else in her. Real or fake, the truth felt impossible to untangle. Who could say how much of his past affection had actually belonged to her?


Sleep barely touched Hannah that night, with thoughts tumbling endlessly through her mind.Exhaustion clung to her by sunrise, leaving her heavy-eyed and hollow.


Downstairs, the dining room buzzed with Danica's laughter as she scrolled her phone, nibbling at her breakfast as if nothing in the world could bother her.
With a bright grin, Danica pressed play on Brinley's voice message for all to hear. "That's a relief, Brinley.Vincent must really care about you," she said, her voice full of delight.


Catching sight of Hannah on the staircase, Danica's smile disappeared, her eyes sharpening with contempt. "So you actually managed to sleep while the whole internet tore you apart?"


Hannah shot Danica a sideways glance and asked the housekeeper for some porridge. Her tone was calm as she replied to Danica. "Why would that be your concern?"


"That's the attitude you're going with?" Danica snapped, smacking her spoon against the table.


Pointing an accusing finger, Danica's voice grew shrill. "If Brinley hadn't told me, I'd never have known how low you'd sink! Airing out private messages online, just to make yourself look better? Have you no shame?"

 
Last night, Danica had gone to bed early and missed all the online drama, only to wake up and find Brinley the sudden darling of public opinion. Eager for the story, she'd immediately called Brinley and gotten an earful about Hannah's so-called manipulations.


Meeting Danica's triumphant stare, Hannah answered with a cold glare of her own, "If anyone here should be ashamed, it's Brinley. Not me."

###Chapter 50 The Woman BehindVictoria Hale
"You-" Danica's eyes turned stormy for a moment,but she covered it up with a strained grin. "Let's not pretend, because everyone can see who the real embarrassment is. Hannah, you're the one getting blasted online right now."


Danica flashed her nails, still glowing from a recent polish, and her voice dripped with satisfaction. "It was smart of me to keep your marriage to Vincent under wraps. Can you imagine the chaos for the Jones Group if word got out? Vincent must regret marrying you more than anything. I've never figured out what he saw in you. Your family never brought anything valuable to the table."


In Danica's eyes, Brinley was exceptional. Brinley had grown up under her careful supervision, carrying both beauty and a strong academic background.
Even after leaving the country for a time following that incident, Brinley was back now and easing into important roles within a subsidiary. It was only a matter of time before Brinley officially joined the Jones family.


Looking at Danica's face full of contempt and hearing that condescending tone, Hannah suddenly lost her appetite. In the past, she'd always kept quiet around Danica, refusing to stir up trouble-but not anymore.


Hannah slapped her spoon onto the table and retorted, "If you've always looked down on me,maybe you should've done more than sit back and watch me marry into this family. Or were you just too powerless to do anything about it?"


A flush crept up Danica's cheeks. She threw her spoon at Hannah, blinded by rage.


Hannah shifted easily, dodging the attack. She knew exactly where Danica's sore spot was. Even though Danica was Vincent's mother, losing her husband early had left her without any real say in the Jones household.

With Sharon doting on Hannah, Danica never had anyone on her side, no matter how much she tried.


"You mad now?" Hannah sneered. "Then let me really give you something to scream about."


A new edge crept into her voice. "I know you've been delaying the transfer of the remaining seven properties to me, and my patience is gone. If those properties aren't in my name by tonight, I'll rip up the divorce agreement while Vincent watches."


Danica shot up from her seat and slapped her palms on the table. "You won't dare!"


With a casual flick, Hannah sent the spoon flying,splattering soup all over Danica's expensive scarf.She gave Danica a smug grin, "Test me."


Remaining completely unbothered, Hannah calmly wiped her hands, settled back in her chair,and started eating the warm porridge at her own pace,never breaking eye contact with Danica.


At exactly ten in the morning, Hannah walked through the doors of Nova Tech.


Inside the glass-walled conference room, she delivered a clear and enthusiastic presentation about the hormone-monitoring wristband, explaining its key features, the opportunities in the market, and her plan for seamless integration.


She had hoped her pitch would open the floor for ideas and discussion. Instead, awkward silence filled the room. Everyone just stared at her until one of the men broke in. "Did a gold-digger really come here to pitch us something serious?"


Another man raised his voice above the rest. "We don't need some CEO's mistress playing around at a tech company. If you don't have any real skills, don't waste our time."


Originally just bystanders to the internet drama, the employees of Nova Tech had pieced it all together when one of the coders traced the online scandaI to none other than their newly installed CEO,Hannah Scott. From there, the office atmosphere had gone from tense to explosive.
Felix tried to jump in, but Hannah silenced him with a simple gesture and addressed the team herself, her tone icy and composed, "Since you're all so interested in my personal life, I'll set the record straight. I graduated at the top of my class, with honors, and a stack of awards from competitions.What actually counts, though, are results-not empty words."



She waited for her words to register. "About this project, let's be honest. Everyone here has been tossing around ideas for days, but nothing impressive has come up yet. Meanwhile, I thought up the hormone-monitoring wristband in a single evening. If you want to question someone's skills,maybe you should look elsewhere."


The silence in the room grew heavier. Not a whisper broke through. Felix's gaze landed on Hannah,admiration plain on his face. Hannah, the founder of this company, was truly remarkable. Intelligent,confident, and never one to back down from a challenge.

If the team ever learned that Hannah was actually "Victoria Hale," the mysterious pioneer who brought women's safety products to market, they'd be floored. She was the mind behind the famous ultrasonic self-defense earrings, which had sold out again and again. Her work had developed a near-cult following.


Still, Hannah preferred to stay out of the spotlight.Even with her return, she had no plans to use her old name for recognition, nor did she want to reveal that she was the founder of Nova Tech. What mattered most to her now was starting over and building her own reputation.


Once the meeting ended, everyone jumped straight into an energetic discussion. The wristband's core features took shape as they began to outline the next phase, turning their ideas into a working prototype.


Felix's worried eyes flickered to Hannah. "Are you alright?"


She gave a reassuring nod. "I'm fine. Nothing they said bothered me. When we started working on the women's safety products, we had dealt with criticism and resistance that was a hundred times worse. This feels easy compared to that." A wide smile brightened her face as she gently patted Felix's shoulder.


That smile brought warmth to her whole expression.Felix found himself quietly mesmerized.


A sudden ring from her phone broke the moment.The call came from an unfamiliar number.


Hannah answered and stiffened at the sound of a recognizable voice. "Ms. Scott, your parents show up at the Jones Group. Don't you think you should do something about it?"


She remembered the speaker-Vincent's assistant,Clive Monroe.Worry hit her all at once. Her parents must have seen something on the internet and marched over to the Jones Group to confront Vincent. There had never been a formal introduction between them. The only thing she had ever shared with them was his picture.

###Chapter 51 That's Our Son-in-law

Documents in hand, Clive made his way downstairs,intending only to hand them off to Vincent. The sight of a middle-aged couple hovering near the lobby desk barely registered at first, until their voices drifted over, boldly declaring Vincent as their son-in-law.


A phone was waved in the air by the man, who pointed at the screen with earnest conviction."That's our daughter's husband. Vincent Jones."


Curiosity got the better of Clive, so he took a closer look. The photo turned out to be nothing but a basic headshot, hardly proof of anything. He had to stifle a laugh at their nerve. Some people would go to any lengths just to cozy up to someone important.


While the receptionist tried to stay polite, her patience was wearing thin. "I'm sorry, you'll need an appointment if you want to see Mr. Jones."


Refusing to take no for an answer, the couple dug in their heels and kept insisting.


Clive noticed the growing tension and decided to put an end to it. Stepping forward, he flashed his work pass with authority. "I've dealt with your type before," he said, voice cold and crisp. "Spread another lie about our CEO, and we'll drag you into court."



Rising indignation flared in the middle-aged woman's eyes. "We're not making this up! Vincent really is our son-in-law. Our daughter married him!"


Disbelief flickered across Clive's face. "That can't be.Mr. Jones isn't married. What wife are you talking about?"



Shocked, the middle-aged man nearly dropped his phone. "What? That's impossible! Our daughter even showed us her marriage certificate!"



Desperately scrolling, he found the photo he wanted and thrust it toward Clive. "Look, this is real! They got married for sure!"

A quick glance at the image stopped Clive cold.There, on the digitalcertificate, he saw two names:Hannah Scott and Vincent Jones.


Recognition dawned on Clive, and a few pieces finally snapped together. So Hannah was their daughter. All at once, the ugly truth took shape.She'd spun a web of lies for her parents-pretending to be Vincent's wife, faking a marriage certificate,and selling the fantasy that she was anything more than a shameless mistress.



Clive couldn't begin to understand what Vincent ever saw in Hannah. Vanity and manipulation defined every move she made. No explanation seemed good enough.


Not even a day had passed since Hannah stirred up an online scandal, going after Brinley out of sheer jealousy, only to retreat and delete the evidence in the dead of night. All morning, the secretarial staff buzzed about the drama, and now Clive found himself standing right in the middle of yet another mess.
With a short laugh, Clive brushed off the couple's presence and fired off a message to Derek,requesting Hannah's contact information. Seconds after Derek replied, he dialed Hannah's number without a second thought. His tone cold,he taunted,"Ms. Scott, your parents are here at the Jones Group. It's about time you dealt with them, don't you think?"


Not waiting for a reply, Clive ended the call abruptly.Before he could break the truth to the couple, the familiar sight of Vincent's car turning into the driveway caught his eye. The car window rolled down, revealing his face.


Stepping forward, Clive quickly passed the documents to Vincent. Sitting in the passenger seat,Brinley caught his eye and flashed a warm smile,while Vincent barely paused to skim the papers before signing his name.


Papers handed back, Vincent glanced in the direction of the lobby but didn't linger, uninterested in the commotion.
Brinley, more observant, pointed discreetly. "There's a couple over there who can't stop staring at us."


A smooth answer rolled off Clive's tongue. "They're probably just awestruck by how photogenic you both are."



Her laughter came easily, a soft blush coloring her cheeks. "You're such a charmer."


Knowing Vincent and Brinley were heading abroad for a vacation and choosing not to spoil the light mood, Clive kept quiet about Hannah's parents and their wild claims.



Across the lobby, Hannah's parents, Raymond Scott and Margaret Scott, waited anxiously. As the car window rolled down, both caught a clear glimpse of Vincent. Margaret's eyes widened. "That's him!That's our son-in-law!"



Eager, the pair hurried after the vehicle, but it was already cruising away before they reached it.


Clive stepped forward to block their path, putting himself between them and any hope of pursuit.


Margaret turned to her husband, clutching his sleeve in excitement. "Did you see? Our daughter really has good taste. He's even more handsome than in the photos."


A pleased nod from Raymond followed as he adjusted his glasses. "He certainly is."


Curiosity turned to hope as Raymond faced Clive."When will Vincent be back?"


A scoff escaped Clive. "You two? Meeting Mr. Jones?
You might as well wish for the moon."

 ###Chapter 52 Is This How We RaisedYou
Raymond's face clouded over at Clive's harsh words."What's that supposed to mean?"


Raymond exchanged a glance with Margaret, an inexplicable sinking feeling passing between them.


Folding his arms across his chest, Clive let out a sharp, humorless laugh. "You two really believe Hannah married our CEO? That's almost funny. Let me break it down for you-your daughter has never been anything more than a mistress. Not a girlfriend,not a wife. For nearly five years, she's been living off Mr.Jones."


No effort was made to cushion his words. "If you want to know the truth, maybe you should ask yourselves how she ended up chasing money instead of building a real career. Instead of earning an honest living, she chose the easy road and became his kept woman."


Margaret erupted, her voice trembling with rage."That's not true! Don't you dare insult her!"


Shock hit Raymond so hard that he nearly lost his breath. Instinctively, Margaret reached over and rubbed his back until he calmed down.


Finally, struggling to steady his voice, Raymond said,"Our daughter worked hard and graduated from a top university. What gives you the right to slander her like this?"



Years spent as respected teachers had never prepared Raymond and Margaret for anything like this. Retirement had been peaceful back home until rumors about Vincent and his first love started to spread online. The stories unsettled them enough to travel all the way to Dorbarrow.


They'd hoped for answers, maybe even a long-overdue meeting with their son-in-law after their daughter's five-year marriage. Instead, they were hit with an avalanche of doubt. It was unthinkable. Could their daughter really have been lying to them all these years?


With a look of thinly veiled contempt, Clive answered, "All that education doesn't change reality.She's not working a real job, and Mr. Jones has dumped her. But she's still hanging around,desperate to get him back."


Pain flickered across Margaret's face. "He broke up with her?" The words felt heavy in her mouth.


A careless shrug was all Clive gave. "Yeah. Mr. Jones is back with his first love, and they're practically inseparable. They're traveling abroad right now. As for Hannah, she's no longer part of his life."


The revelation left Raymond and Margaret stunned,paralyzed by the realization that everything they'd believed might have been a lie.


Not another word was spared for the devastated couple as Clive walked away, heading back to his routine as if nothing significant had happened.
...


Caught in heavy traffic, Hannah finally arrived at the Jones Group headquarters, nerves already frayed.Entering the lobby, she immediately spotted her parents sitting alone, their faces clouded with sadness and confusion. No part of her expected Vincent to show up, not after everything that had happened.



Approaching quietly, Hannah noticed just how shaken her parents looked. Hands clasped together,she spoke softly. "Why didn't you let me know you were coming?"


Margaret seemed ready to answer, but Raymond raised a hand, signaling her to stay silent. A stern gaze fixed on Hannah, he spoke with no room for argument. "Bring us to your husband."


Tension crept into Hannah's posture. The last thing she wanted was for her parents to become entangled with Vincent. "He's swamped at work these days.Meeting now isn't possible."
Unmoved, Raymond's voice turned even more insistent. "Call him. I want to speak with him myself."


Cornered by her father's persistence, Hannah reached for her phone and dialed Vincent's number.


Once went to voicemail. No reply. A second call-still nothing. By the third ring, it was clear he wasn't going to answer.


Familiar disappointment flickered in Hannah's eyes."See? He's busy," she said, forcing her features to remain calm.


"At least let us visit his office," Raymond added.


Panic threatened to surface on Hannah's face.Almost nobody at the Jones Group knew she was Vincent's rightful wife. To them, she was just a mistress, never acknowledged in public. If her parents ever learned that, anger wouldn't be the worst of it. Their hearts would break right in two. She knew she couldn't handle the sight of that-not now,not ever.
"We should just head home for now," Hannah suggested quickly. "Maybe we can tour his office another day."


Reaching for her father's arm, she tried gently to guide him toward the exit.


But Raymond pulled away from her, a deep disappointment coloring his words. "You're still keeping things from us. Hannah, is this how we raised you?"
###Chapter 53 | Want To Hear It FromHim Myself
A chill swept through Hannah as her father's reaction landed, dread coiling tightly inside her. "Is something wrong?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.


Margaret started to reply, but Raymond silenced her with a stern hand. "Let me handle this."


Facing his daughter, his words shook with emotion,and he barely managed to keep in check. "Answer me, Hannah. Is Vincent Jones truly your husband-the CEO everyone talks about?"


Hannah immediately guessed what had happened.Someone must've told her parents something-and it was most likely that secretary Clive.


The lobby grew busy around them, yet more and more people slowed their steps, drawn by the tension building in the air.


Determined to avoid an ugly public confrontation,Hannah tried to steady herself. "We'll talk at home.Please, let's leave now, and I'll explain everything there."


But Raymond wouldn't budge. "We're not going anywhere. You answer me right now. Are you working a real job, or have you really been living off a man all this time?"



That word hit like a slap. Hannah instinctively shook her head. "No, that's not true."


"Then start explaining," he urged, his finger trembling as he pointed at her. "Tell me the truth.Is your marriage even real? Why does no one acknowledge you as Vincent Jones's wife? Why is everyone saying you're just his mistress?"


He fixed her with an unyielding stare, desperate for answers. But Hannah looked away, unable to speak.


The tension in his raised voice only escalated. "Don't just stand there. Say something! I want the truth!"


A circle of onlookers had formed, their whispers and camera phones quietly recording the unfolding family drama. Hannah refused to utter a word in front of strangers.


Raymond mistook her silence for shame. His expression collapsed into heartbreak. Their daughter... She had truly ended up living as another man's kept woman. Pain was clear in his eyes, and he backed away. "Get out of my sight. You're not the daughter | thought I raised. The Hannah I know wouldn't trade her dignity for a life like this."


His breathing turned ragged, each breath rougher than the last.



Hannah opened her mouth, trying to steer the conversation elsewhere-to stop this downward spiral-but the moment she lifted her head, she saw her father struggling for breath, his face drained of color. "Dad! Dad, what's happening?"


Margaret jumped in quickly, cradling her husband  and rubbing his back. "Hannah, his blood pressure's spiking. We need to get him to the hospital,now!"


A shaky "Alright" was all Hannah could manage.


The lobby's curious eyes, their murmurs, and the flashes from phones faded as Hannah hurried her parents outside, her gaze cold and distant.


None of the trio spoke during the ride. Silence pressed in on all sides.


Before long,Raymond was admitted to the hospital.


Tears streaked down Margaret's cheeks as she tried to find her voice. "Maybe we never should have come, Hannah. This only made things worse for you."


Sitting close, Hannah reached for a tissue and gently dabbed her mother's face, whispering, "Mom,please. Dad's going to pull through. You have to trust that."


Grief made Margaret's voice quiver as she looked up,her eyes red and swollen. "Hannah, have things been hard for you all these years?"
Fingers gripping her daughter's hand for support,Margaret pleaded, "Come back with us. Life might be quieter, but at least you'll have your dignity. I can't bear to see you living like this." Always, their daughter had stood tall and proud. The thought of her being anyone's mistress was almost too much for them to bear.


A dull ache filled Hannah's chest as she watched her mother struggle to hold herself together. Worry had driven her parents all this way, hoping for reassurance and a glimpse of happiness in her life.All they had wanted was to meet Vincent and see her contented finally. Instead, they'd been met with doubt and humiliation.



Happiness for their only child had always been their greatest wish. Facing a truth so painful seemed impossible.


Blinking back her own tears, Hannah squeezed Margaret's shoulder, trying to sound light even though her heart was heavy. "Mom, I'm not someone's plaything. Vincent and I are actually married. It's just that we kept the marriage under wraps. You know how these wealthy families are-it's all about appearances."


A hopeful look flickered in Margaret's eyes. "Is that true?"


Determined to prove herself, Hannah decided to call Vincent again. "You don't have to worry, Mom. Dad's here in the hospital, and I know Vincent will come as soon as he can."


In reality, Hannah had once planned to tell her parents she and Vincent were getting a divorce. But circumstances had changed, and the truth would only cause more pain now. Right now, she needed to put their minds at ease.


Once her father was stable and out of emergency care, a measure of relief settled over Hannah.


Taking her seat at his bedside, she leaned in and explained quietly, "Dad, I really am married to Vincent. We just never made it public, which is why there are so many rumors. But you have my word, it's real."



Suspicion lingered in Raymond's eyes as he turned toward his wife. "You believe her?"


Margaret nodded with quiet conviction."Ido."


Still, Raymond looked skeptical. "Don't try to lie to me just because I'm not well. I can handle the truth,no matter what it is."


Hannah shook her head. "I'm telling you the truth.Vincent and I are legally married." She paused, willing herself to stay strong. "If you want, I'll even bring the marriage license for you to see."


A skeptical look remained on Raymond's face. "If what you're saying is true, bring Vincent here. I want to hear it from him myself."

###Chapter 54 | Want To Head BackSooner
Raymond shifted upright in the hospital bed,determination flashing in his eyes. "No matter how busy Vincent claims to be, I am his father-in-law, and I deserve at least a visit."



A meaningful glance passed between Raymond and Margaret,silent understanding hanging in the air.


He added, "Besides, you two have been married for five years, and we've never even met your husband.That doesn't feel right."


Hannah met his gaze, sensing his resolve and knowing nothing she said could change his mind.


Trying to smooth things over, Margaret offered a gentle smile, "Don't worry. Our daughter said Vincent would come. Let's trust her."


Without hesitation, Hannah replied, "I'll call him right now."


Stepping into the hallway, Hannah kept her phone pressed to her ear, hoping Vincent would finally answer. But call after call went unanswered, each one feeding her mounting anxiety.


Frowning, Hannah reached out to Derek for answers."Any idea where Vincent is right now?"


"Mr. Jones left the country on a business trip. Has something happened?" Derek didn't need to ask-just by the sounds in the background, he could tell she was calling from a hospital.


Avoiding the details, she kept her voice steady. "Do you know when he'll return?"


"He didn't mention a specific date. Maybe try calling him directly?" Derek suggested, treading carefully.


With nothing left to say, Hannah murmured,"Thanks," and ended the call.


Resorting to Derek was a last resort. She hadn't wanted to bother him, but Vincent's silence left her no choice. She then sent Vincent a message. "When are you coming back?"


But after she hit send on the message, the urge to call vanished completely. Still, when she caught sight of her parents' hopeful faces through the glass of the hospital room window, something in her refused to give up.


Relentlessly, she kept dialing his number, feeling the old ache she thought she'd buried return with every unanswered ring. That familiar sting of waiting for Vincent, of being met with silence, dragged her back to the hardest ###Chapters of their marriage.


Painful as it was, Hannah pressed on, for her parents'sake.



Somewhere between desperation and resignation,the call finally connected.


Vincent's voice on the other end let Hannah release a shaky sigh of relief. "Vincent, when are you coming back?"
Silence lingered on the line, a drawn-out pause that made Hannah's nerves stretch thin. It sounded as though Vincent was checking his surroundings before finally responding, "Probably three days.What's the matter?"


Her lips parted and answered, "My parents-"


Suddenly, another voice floated through the phone,unmistakably Brinley's. "Vincent, give this a try."


Everything inside Hannah turned to ice. Numb realization settled over her. No business trip had taken him overseas-he was on vacation, basking in Brinley's affection.


A heavy, painful silence followed. Not even the static offered comfort.


Then, Vincent's voice came through again. "You were saying about your parents?"


An edge crept into Hannah's reply. "It's nothìng important. They just sent me some local specialties."


He offered only a vague sound of acknowledgment, his thoughts already drifting away. His voice was low."Anything else?"


She hesitated for a moment, still holding onto a shred of hope. "It's just... Would you mind talking to my parents-"


Before Hannah could finish, the call disconnected,cutting her off mid-sentence. Through the crackle of the dead line, Brinley's voice carried faintly, calling Vincent's name.



Familiar disappointment wrapped around Hannah's heart. She'd seen this pattern so many timnes, but the sting never faded. For a fleeting moment, when Vincent answered, she'd believed he might actually help her, play along for her parents' sake. Anything to keep them from worrying in their old age. Reality however, showed no mercy. Vincent was somewhere far away, wrapped up in a new romance, oblivious to the promises he'd made her long ago.


Standing in the hallway, Hannah watched her parents through the hospital door, self-blame weighing her down like a heavy blanket. Fully grown, and yet sheDetermined not to let them see her falter, she composed herself and strode back into the room,wearing a bright, practiced smile. "I told you-he's really busy. He's away on business right now."


The hope faded instantly from their faces, replaced by shadow and worry.


A deep sadness etched itself across Margaret's features.



Raymond kept his gaze locked on Hannah, silent at first. After a moment, he released a heavy sigh."I just hope you haven't lied to yourself so long that you actually believe it."


Margaret's voice trembled with sadness. "Tell me,Hannah, if this marriage is real, what kind of son-in-law avoids his in-laws for five whole years?"


No words came to Hannah. The truth was too bitter to share, and she knew that without meeting Vincent,her parents would never believe her. Explaining that her husband's heart belonged to someone else would only deepen their worry and heartbreak.


The sting of their disappointment made it hard for Hannah to even draw breath. "He'll visit once his work settles down," she replied, forcing a smile that felt brittle.







Thousands of miles away in Calveria, Brinley touched Vincent's arm gently. "Vincent, the people you're meeting have arrived."


Vincent had taken a red-eye flight on his private jet to Calveria after receiving an urgent acquisition proposal the night before.


Brinley had insisted on joining him, claiming a change of scenery would lift the weight from her mind.


Before agreeing, Vincent had checked with her doctors-travel, they assured him, could be good for her heart. Besides, it suited him to put some distance between himself and Hannah-she'd been acting up a lot lately.


What surprised him was how quickly her calls and texts started pouring in as soon as he left. A subtle smirk crossed his lips.


Brinley, noticing the faint curve of his lips, asked with curiosity, "What is it, Vincent? Did the deal meet your expectations?"


Vincent's response was smooth, but his satisfaction was clear. "Nothing." All those texts. All those calls.Hannah was clearly rattled. He knew it-she cared about him deeply.


Fastening his cufflinks, Vincent stepped into the meeting room with unshakeable confidence. Minutes later, he'd dissected the acquisition proposal,exposed glaring issues, and secured an extra three percent profit for the company with sharp, decisive tactics.



Plans shifted quickly after the meeting. Brinley,watching the pace pick up, wondered if Vincent was just eager to have more free time with her. She asked softly, "I thought we'd stay for three days?"


Sunlight poured in through the towering windows as Vincent considered her words. A faint, mysterious smile played on his lips. "I want to head back sooner," he answered.
###Chapter 55 Inviting Them To Lunch
Back at the hospital, Hannah decided to steer the conversation away from Vincent and began talking about her work instead.


News that Hannah actually held a job brought a flicker of relief to her parents. Curious and a bit anxious, they started peppering her with questions about her daily routine and responsibilities. Bit by bit,their faces softened-at least the rumors of unemployment weren't true.


Still, Margaret gently circled back to the issue that troubled her most. "Even so, Hannah,your father and I need to meet your husband at some point," she insisted. She couldn't rest easy until she'd seen her son-in-law in person, especially after everything people had said about their daughter.


Her voice low and uncertain, Hannah said,"Okay."

 
When Raymond's IV finished, he wasted no time insisting on being discharged. The heavy scent of antiseptic in the hospital made him restless.


Since there was no convincing him to change his mind, Hannah had no other option but to finish filling out the discharge forms. Rather than return to the Jones estate and risk an awkward encounter with Danica, she brought her parents back to her place at Sterling Heights.


A stack of delivery boxes greeted them outside Unit 2201.


Margaret eyed the packages and asked, "Has it been a while since you came home?"


"Yeah, I haven't been back much lately," Hannah replied, her words guarded.


Raymond took in the fresh look of the apartment, his skepticism clear. "Everything here looks untouched.Do you and Vincent actually stay here?"


Calmly, Hannah lied, "We moved back to the Jones estate recently. Vincent bought this apartment as an investment, but it's under my name."


Trying to reassure them, she added, "There's really no reason to doubt me. I'm married to Vincent.He's... He's been quite generous with me."


"We'll see for ourselves when he finally shows up."Raymond remained unswayed, his voice firm.


A gentle nudge from Margaret and a warning look urged him to stop, but he just shrugged. "I didn't say anything wrong."


Margaret could only roll her eyes in mild exasperation.


At that moment, Hannah's phone lit up. It was Sharon. A moment's hesitation passed before she answered."Hello? Sharon?"


Recognizing the name on the call, Margaret and Raymond exchanged a look.


"Hannah, it's getting late. Why aren't you back yet?"Sharon's voice filtered through the phone, concern clear as day.

Only then did Hannah glance at the clock. Ten o'clock had crept up on her. Normally, she would have called Sharon to explain if she planned to miss dinner. A quick apology slipped from her lips. "Sorry,Sharon. I forgot to let you know, I won't be home tonight. My parents are visiting, and I'd like to spend a few days showing them around Dorbarrow."


That news caught Sharon off guard. "Your parents are here? That's wonderful!" Her tone grew more serious. "In that case, bring them over tomorrow,Hannah. I'll arrange a proper dinner so we can welcome them."



A gentle refusal from Hannah followed. "Thank you,but it's alright. I'll handle things myself. My parents are only here for a short while before they head home."


Raymond,unable to sit by any longer, reached for the phone before Hannah could react. "Hello, is this Ms.Sharon Jones? I'm Hannah's father, Raymond Scott."


Sharon's reply was gracious. "Hello, Mr. Scott. I haven't been feeling well and haven't had the chance to visit. But now that you're in town, I'd love to host a meal for you and your wife. Would you be available tomorrow?"


A spark of hope brightened Raymond's face. "That sounds perfect! We've been wanting to meet our in-laws for a long time."


Hannah made a move to reclaim her phone, but Margaret quickly stepped in to hold her back.


Eager to cement the invitation, Raymond continued,"It would mean a lot for my wife and me to finally meet Vincent. Would tomorrow work for everyone?"


Warmth and a hint of curiosity colored Sharon's response. "We'd be delighted to have you. Although,isn't Vincent with you right now?"


Raymond answered honestly, "No, unfortunately not.Hannah mentioned he was busy with work, so we haven't seen him yet."


A brief pause stretched over the line before Sharon spoke, her voice now edged with purpose."Thank you for letting me know. Let's settle it-tomorrow at noon, come to the Jones family estate. We'll have lunch together."


"That's wonderful," Raymond said, his mood visibly lifted as he ended the call. A weight lifted from his shoulders, he finally felt reassured-at least for now,those ugly rumors about his daughter being a mistress had lost their hold.
###Chapter 56 Why Aren't You WithHannah
A furrow formed on Hannah's brow as she struggled to keep her frustration in check. "Dad, you agreed way too quickly. Why would you do that without asking me first?"


"What's the big deal about two families sitting down for a meal?" Raymond countered. "What's strange is your reaction. Why are you so against us having dinner with them? What, now that you've married into money, you're suddenly embarrassed by your parents?"


Margaret chimed in, "Hannah, you don't want us to meet the Jones family?"


A rush to defend herself left Hannah's words tumbling out. "No, that's not it at all! Of course, I want you to meet them."
Truthfully, the thought of her parents mingling with the Joneses filled Hannah with dread. She wished desperately that their lives could remain separate.


Raymond didn't miss a moment. "Good. I'm really looking forward to meeting your husband."


What he didn't say out loud was that he had his own plan-once he saw Vincent, he would find an excuse to visit the company. He wanted a word with that secretary who'd dared to badmouth his daughter. No one would ever get away with shaming his family,least of all his little girl.


That night, the apartment at Sterling Heights echoed with Hannah's restless movements as she tidied up,unable to shake her anxiety. Sleep came in fragments, leaving her even more unsettled.






Across the ocean in Calveria, Vincent finished closing a major deal when his phone buzzed insistently.Sharon's name flashed across the screen. He answered right away.
"Vincent, you ignore my calls now? Three times I've tried to reach you!" Irritation laced every word as Sharon spoke, her voice cutting sharper than before.


Vincent glanced at the call logs. Three missed calls from her. "Work kept me busy, Grandma. I didn't mean to miss them."



Sharon's tone didn't soften. "Busy with what,exactly? For all I know, you're just avoiding us." A chill crept into her voice. "Answer me this, why aren't you with Hannah? No matter what your schedule looks like, shouldn't you be by her side at a time like this?"


A heavy frown settled on Vincent's face. "Did she say something to you?"


"I wish she would," Sharon replied, a note of sadness underlying her words. "That girl suffers in silence.She'd never say a word, even if you've let her down.It's notin her nature to speak up."


Vincent's frustration grew. "What areyou getting at,Grandma?"

Her answer was immediate. "You'll be home for lunch tomorrow."


A flat refusal escaped him. "I can't make it. There's an important meeting I can't reschedule."


Sharon's warning cut through his protest. "If you're not at the family estate by noon, don't call me your grandmother ever again."


An exhale of exasperation slipped from Vincent. "I'm still in Calveria, finalizing the acquisition. There's no way I can return that fast."

An uncomfortable pause filled the call, neither side quick to speak.


Eventually, Vincent's voice came through, cautious."Is there something special about tomorrow that l should know?"


Sharon's tone turned icy, slicing through the distance between them. "You really have no idea? Hannah's parents are in town. As their in-laws, it's our responsibility to treat them with respect and host them properly."


The revelation left Vincent momentarily speechless,and suddenly, Hannah's words from earlier this morning made perfect sense. Brows knittíng together, he admitted, "Honestly, I wasn't aware. No one told me."



A weary sigh escaped Sharon. The weight of disappointment pressed into her next words."Hannah deserved so much more from the start.You two got married in secret without so much as a ceremony or celebration. Five years have passed,and her parents still remain strangers to us. This time, we need to make things right. You must be back by noon tomorrow. Do you understand?"


"I'll do what I can," Vincent replied, tension lining his voice.


In the corner, Brinley listened in silence, her own feelings roiling beneath a calm exterior. Why pretend for the sake of appearances, she wondered, when divorce was already looming on the horizon?
Observing Sharon's unwavering support for Hannah,Brinley realized just how fiercely protective Sharon was, clearly the greatest hurdle between her and any future with Vincent.



With a quiet resolve, Brinley tucked away that realization and then appeared at Vincent's side,offering him a plate of fruit and a sweet, practiced smile. Her hand paused when she overheard him on the phone, calmly rescheduling the next day's meeting to an online session.


Shock flashed in her eyes. Was he really flying home so suddenly? It had taken her a lot of effort to get Vincent to bring her on this trip abroad, and yet the entire time, he'd been buried in negotiations. No sightseeing, no real time together. Finally, just as she thought she'd have his full attention, everything was upended, once again, by Hannah.


Bitterness curled inside Brinley, mixed with a sense of insecurity she couldn't shake. Hannah was just a stand-in. So why was Vincent going to such lengths for her?
...


Back in Dorbarrow, Sharon rose before dawn,orchestrating the kitchen staff with the energy of a general preparing for a feast.


When Danica descended the stairs and took in the scene, a flurry of activity and gleaming silver platters, her curiosity sharpened into suspicion."Who's coming over today?" she asked.


"The lunch is to welcome Hannah's parents," a servant replied with honesty.


At once, Danica's expression clouded over.What was Hannah thinking, throwing a family gathering on the eve of her own divorce?


Without wasting another second, Danica marched back upstairs and dialed Hannah's number.


Over at Sterling Heights, Hannah was busy helping her father choose a jacket. Her phone's persistent ringing finally caught Margaret's attention, prompting her to answer.
###Chapter 57 What Kind Of Life HadShe Really Been living

Barely had Margaret answered the call before a harsh voice came barreling through the receiver.


"Just how thick-skinned are you, Hannah? Still pushing Sharon to host a lavish lunch for your parents? What's the deal-are they really that eager to set foot in a rich family's house like ours?Honestly, calling you shameless doesn't even scratch the surface. You're not just shameless. You're foolish, and worse, you know exactly how to twist things to get what you want."


The tirade hit Margaret like a slap, leaving her momentarily speechless. Was this woman actually insulting Hannah?


Heat rushed to Margaret's cheeks, but she fought to steady her voice. "Excuse me. Who do you think you are, speaking about my daughter that way?"
A beat of silence hung between them. Danica,caught off guard, realized she was speaking to Hannah's mother but didn't mince her words. "So what if I insulted her? What I said is true. Isn't it typical of a low-class family to raise such a grasping,shallow daughter?"


Pain and anger twisted in Margaret's chest. She dug her nails into her palm but kept her voice even. "You know nothing about my child. Hannah has more decency in her little finger than you could ever understand."


Something in the speaker's tone, arrogance mixed with cold contempt, told Margaret everything she needed to know. This must be Hannah's mother-in-law. Righteous fury rose in Margaret's voice. "If we're comparing mothers, I'd say you've failed more spectacularly. How else would you explain a son like Vincent, who can't even manage basic manners?"


"You!" Danica fumed, all bluster and outrage. The resemblance to Hannah's stubbornness was almost uncanny.

 Without waiting for another insult, Margaret ended the call and let the phone drop to her lap. She glanced toward the living room where Raymond and Hannah were still chatting about his outfit, blissfully unaware. Part of her wanted to suggest cancelling the visit. Wouldn't it be easier to skip the Jones family estate and simply enjoy Dorbarrow together,just the three of them?



But Danica's words lingered in Margaret's mind, sour and sharp. What sort of world had her daughter been living in all these years?


Each passing moment tightened the ache in Margaret's chest, yet her curiosity grew stronger. No word of the conversation left her lips, but the spark of anticipation was gone.


From across the room, Hannah noticed her mother's shift in mood and guessed she was still upset about the uncertainty of seeing Vincent. Slipping an arm around Margaret's shoulders, she spoke softly. "It'll be fine, Mom. Vincent will show up for lunch."

That was what Sharon had told her. With his grandmother's word as law, Hannah felt sure Vincent wouldn't dare refuse.



Hearing those words, Raymond's spirits lifted, and a broad, genuine smile creased his face.


Margaret, on the other hand, managed only a faint nod, her expression revealinglittle of what she truly felt.



They made their way to the Jones estate with Hannah at the wheel, a carefully wrapped gift nestled in her lap.


Arriving at the gates, they found Sharon already waiting for them, her presence dignified and welcoming, with several staff members at her side.


The scale and formality of the greeting left both Raymond and Margaret slightly awed and a bit unsure of themselves.



Reaching for Sharon's arm, Hannah offered a warm introduction. "These are my parents, Sharon."
"Hello, Mrs. Jones." Raymond and Margaret greeted her and then passed their gift to a waiting attendant.


Sharon welcomed them with a radiant smile. "I'm so glad you're here. For years, l've hoped for this moment. If my health were better, I'd have visited you myself to thank you for raising such a wonderful daughter. We're so fortunate to have her in our lives."


Raymond,caught off guard by such genuine praise,could only stutter, "Thank you. That's very kind of you."


Deep inside, relief washed over him. Any lingering doubts or nasty rumors of his daughter being a kept woman evaporated-his daughter was clearly respected and valued here.


Margaret, moved nearly to tears, felt the tension in her chest finally ease. With Sharon watching over Hannah, maybe things wouldn't be so hard for Hannah after all.


Pointing at a woman nearby, Sharon continued,"This is Vincent's mother,Danica."

An icy smile flickered across Danica's lips as she forced a greeting. "Hello." Her reluctance was obvious. She had come only at Sharon's insistence.


Recognition flashed in Margaret's eyes the instant she heard that voice. The memory of that earlier phone call-and the insults-came flooding back.


Maintaining her composure, Sharon's presence remained steady and authoritative. "Vincent should arrive soon," she announced, smiling at Hannah's parents. "Shall we start lunch while we wait?"


Raymond offered a polite response. "That sounds wonderful. Thank you."


Inside the dining room, a lavish spread awaited.Sharon herself guided Hannah's parents to their seats, ensuring they felt included.


Danica took the seat farthest from Raymond and Margaret, fanning her hand in front of her face."My God, is that musty thrift-store smell coming from them?"
The air thickened instantly. The conversation stopped. Raymond and Margaret stiffened,trying to hide their discomfort and wounded pride.


Before Hannah could uttera word in protest, Sharon placed a firm, reassuring hand on her arm.


With a cool, commanding gaze, Sharon looked straight at Danica. "If you're not in the mood to join us, you're welcome to excuse yourself."


With a dramatic sigh, Danica poured herself a generous glass of wine. "I suppose that was out of line. Let's call it water under the bridge. I'll drink to make up for it."


Sharon's stern features relaxed a shade, though her gaze never fully softened.


Feigning curiosity, Danica flashed a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "So, you're both retired from teaching,right?"


Margaret's response came quietly, eyes guarded.

Raymond, however, straightened with a hint of pride.
"That's right. Teaching was our passion for many years."


A glint of mischief danced in Danica's eyes as she pressed on. "Tell me, what sort of pension does that career earn you these days?"


"Put together, it's a bit over ten thousand," Raymond answered honestly. That amount had always been enough for them to live without worry-they'd never relied on Hannah to get by.


A sharp, mirthless laugh burst from Danica. "Ten thousand? My goodness, that wouldn't even buy a single handbag from my collection!"


She swept a hand toward the table, her tone turning careless. "Watch out for the silverware,would you?Each piece is worth more than a teacher's salary for a year. Break one, and you'd spend the rest of your life paying it off."


Embarrassment flickered across Raymond's and Margaret's faces as they exchanged an uneasy glance.
Hannah's hands curled into fists beneath the linen,her chest tightening at the cruelty of it all.


An icy edge sliced through Sharon's patience."Danica, that's enough. Go upstairs." The reprimand set off a sudden fit of coughing, her anger unmistakable.

###Chapter 58 Her Mother ConfrontedDanica
Private jet engines hummed beneath Vincent's feet as he prepared for takeoff, focused on making it home in time for the family lunch.


Brinley, however, wasn't in the best mood. Anxiously,she tapped her phone again and again, refreshing her email in anticipation. Only the night before, she'd pulled strings and spent a significant sum to contact a prestigious hospital. Finally, the awaited reply illuminated her screen, making her heart skip.


Feigning excitement, she leaned over and shook Vincent's shoulder. "Vincent! The doctor finally replied!"


He had barely slept over the past two days, having worked around the clock to close the acquisition deal. Being abruptly shaken awake, his eyes darkened with fatigue and annoyance. "What is it?"
Trying to sound as bright as possible, Brinley explained, "I've been reaching out to top heart specialists in Calveria. One of them just emailed me.They're willing to see me for a consultation."


Vincent's brow furrowed, still half-asleep. "Right now?"





"Yes, but I know you promised your grandmother lunch," she said, biting her lip. "Really, don't let me keep you. I can go alone if I have to. Family should come first."



Her words dripped with self-sacrifice, as though she was letting him off the hook.


For several moments, Vincent sat in silence,deliberating.Decision made, he spoke to the captain."Change our course. We're heading to the hospital."Turning to Brinley, his voice was gentle. "Your health is more important than anything else."


He figured a meal at home could always be postponed. This appointment, on the other hand,might be a rare opportunity. He couldn't afford to let  anything happen to her.


Satisfaction flashed in Brinley's eyes. She wasted no time sending a triumphant message to Hannah.






Back at the Jones estate, following Sharon's harsh rebuke, Danica grew quiet, seeking comfort in another glass of wine.


With gracious warmth, Sharon smoothed over the earlier unpleasantness, ensuring Raymond and Margaret felt welcome. The meal soon settled into a peaceful rhythm.


By the time dessert was served, one chair remained conspicuously empty. Raymond finally spoke up. "ls Vincent not joining us?"


Hannah's hands fidgeted in her lap. Uncertanty clouded her features.


Setting her silverware aside, Sharon stood and offered a reassuring smile. "Let me see what's keeping him."
Before stepping away, Sharon caught Hannah's eye."Hannah, just make sure your parents are comfortable and have everything they need. No need to treat us with such formality."


"Okay." Hannah nodded.


Just as Hannah turned to ask if her parents wanted anything else to eat, a sharp laugh cut through the air.



Danica's voice rang out, dripping with scorn. "Do you really believe you're worthy of meeting Vincent? Just look at yourself-this wvhole thing is laughable." She took another deep swig from her glass.


With a steely glare, Hannah signaled to the staff."She's clearly had too much. Please take her upstairs."


"Understood." Obediently, two maids moved forward to help, but Danica jerked free, bristling. "I'm not drunk!"


A glare from Danica pinned the staff in place. "Think twice before you listen to Hannah. If you want to keep your jobs, don't take orders from her."


The two maids didn't dare to move, tension crackling in the silence.


Raising her voice for everyone to hear,Danica stood tall. "Since we're all gathered here,let me finally say what's been on my mind." Every eye in the room was on her as she spat out, "Your daughter, Hannah,is nothing more than a cheap knockoff-gaudy, tacky,and embarrassing for anyone to be seen with."


Margaret's hands balled into tight fists at her sides,all the warmth she'd felt from chatting with Sharon earlier draining away in an instant.


Years of teaching had trained Raymond to hold his tongue, but humiliation burned on his face as he tossed back his wine, silent and furious.


Hannah hurried to her parents, her worry growing as she saw her father's composure slipping. "She's just drunk," she said softly. "Please don't mind her.Normally... She's not like this."
Attempting to diffuse the situation, Hannah tried to guide Danica away from the table, only to be pushed aside.


Danica's eyes narrowed in contempt. "You think I wanted my son to marry her? Please. Your daughter was the one clinging to hm like a desperate hooker!When she first married into our family, she atleast knew her place, quiet, obedient, never making trouble. But now? She's mouthy and impossible to control. Thank goodness the marriage stayed under wraps. If anyone found out the great Jones family was linked to someone like her, we'd be a laughingstock!"


Turning her contempt on Raymond and Margaret,Danica added, "And you two, really, you really think you're fit to be related to the Jones family? Don't make me laugh."


A sharp gesture from her summoned the housekeeper. "Aubrey, scrub everything down after this. I want no trace of their poverty clinging to my dining room. Even the air feels dirty."
The coldness in Hannah's face deepened, but before she could respond, a glass of wine sailed across the table, landing squarely on Danica and soaking her dress.


Gasps echoed. Margaret, normally so gentle, had hurled it without a moment's hesitation.


For a moment, even Hannah was speechless-she had never seen her mother so fierce.


Raymond stared at his wife, wide-eyed. Decades together, and he'd never seen her lose control like this.



Danica erupted, shouting, "How dare you! What gives you the right to throw wine at me?"


Margaret met Danica's glare head-on, her voice ringing with conviction. "You deserve that throw," she declared, fury sharp in her eyes. "Back home, I don't even let my daughter do chores, but here, you treat her as if she's beneath you. You've gone way too far."


Leaning closer, Margaret gave an exaggerated sniff, a look of disdain curling her lips. "Funny, no matter how much perfume you wear, it can't mask that foul stench every time you open your mouth."


Danica bristled, words tumbling in disbelief. "You-"


"Oh, save it," Margaret snapped. "You think we're beneath you? Well, guess what? We look down on you too. A so-called prestigious family that treats their daughter-in-law like a servant? I wouldn't be surprised if your family business hits a dead end soon."



A scream erupted as Danica lunged, wild and furious,grabbing for Margaret's hair. "How dare you! I'Il tear you apart!"


But Margaret side-stepped with surprising speed,not even ruffled. "Tear me apart? You'd have to catch me first. Honestly, I'd rather be anywhere but this miserable house."



Crashing against the table, Danica yelped in pain,but Margaret didn't even look back. Both Hannah and Raymond stood in shock, unsure how to process the  scene they'd just witnessed.


A swirl of emotions knotted Hannah's chest as she realized her mother had stood up for her. Never in her life had she seen her mother's sudden fierceness, so unyielding in the face of cruelty.


Margaret grabbed Hannah's hand and turned to Raymond, all business. "Well? Are you coming, or do you want to stay and be humiliated a minute longer?"


Raymond, trying to stay rational, stopped her for a second. "Aren't we waiting for Vincent?"


A shake of Margaret's head made her answer clear."After all that? What's the point?"


"Right," Raymond muttered.


With barely another glance at the house, the three of them left together, heads high and backs unbowed.


By the time Sharon hurried back into the dinìng room, the guests were gone, and Danica lay slumped at the table, reeking of wine and defeat.
Afterward, Hannah placed a quick call to Sharon to explain the abrupt departure and then drove her parents straight to the train station.


No amount of gentle pleading from Hannah could change her parents' minds. Both Raymond and Margaret were set on leaving Dorbarrow behind.


Hannah's heart felt heavy with regret. She knew she hadn't protected her parents from disappointment.Her thoughts swirled with self-reproach and sadness, but then a familiar voice broke through the haze. "Mrs. Jones, I finally managed to catch up with you."

###Chapter 59 False Hope
Derek hurried over, out of breath, his suit rumpled from the rush.


Catching sight of Derek, a flash of surprise and tentative relief passed over Hannah's features.Maybe, just maybe, Vincent had arrived too. Her gaze darted past Derek, scanning for any sign of Vincent but finding none.


But a single familiar silhouette lingered in the distance. A hopeful thought flickered in her mind.Perhaps Vincent was waiting in the car, sending Derek ahead as a scout. That thought gave her some hope-maybe her parents would still get to see him after all. She seized the moment to introduce Derek."Dad, Mom, this is Derek Barrett, Vincent's assistant."


"Nice to meet you." Raymond extended his hand with a genuine smile. He shared Hannah's mindset. The presence of an assistant suggested Vincent couldn't be far behind. Maybe the crowded station had simply delayed his arrival.


Meanwhile, Margaret remained quiet, her mind still spinning from the earlier confrontation at the estate.


Derek finally caught his breath and said politely,"Mrs. Jones, Mr. and Mrs. Scott, could you come with me,please?"


No hesitation showed in Hannah's response. "Of course."



A plan took root in her mind. If Vincent managed to salvage today and smoothed things over with her parents, she'd let bygones be bygones and even try to avoid another fight with him for the rest of their days together,however few remained.


As they made their way across the lot, the familiar lines of the Bentley caught Hannah's eye. Excitement surged as she hurried ahead and pulled open the back door.


But the seat inside was empty. Her hopeful expression vanished. Confusion and disappointment twisted inside her.Where was Vincent now?



Derek's eyes flicked to Hannah, instantly picking up on her expectation that Vincent would be waiting in the car, ready to greet them. The disappointment etched on her face confirmed his suspicions.


Turning away from the empty seat, Hannah finally looked to Derek for answers. He offered a stiff,apologetic smile and then reached into the back for several gift bags. "Mr. and Mrs. Scott, Mr. Jones wanted you to have these," he said, holding them out politely.


Raymond didn't reach for the bags. His voice had gone cool. "Is Vincent coming? Where is he now?"


Carefully, Derek tried to explain, "Mr. Jones got pulled into a last-minute merger negotiation. He couldn't break away. As soon as he realized he wouldn't make it in time, he asked me to deliver these gifts in his place."
A silent exchange passed between Raymond and Margaret. Both their faces showed only quiet disappointment, hearts aching for their daughter.


Swiping at the sweat on his borow, Derek tried to defuse the tension, wishing this part of his job didn't feel so thankless.



Hannah forced herself to stay composed. "It's almost time, Mom, Dad. Let me walk you back to the train."Facing Derek, her tone was icy. "We don't need the gifts. My parents have enough to carry as it is."


Her eyes held not a shred of warmth.


Derek hesitated, trying again to offer the bags, but neither parent budged. Seeing no other option, he quietly returned everything to the trunk, not saying another word.



Hannah dismissed Derek with a nod, then slipped an arm around her parents and led them to the train platform herself.


Minutes before departure, Margaret pulled Hannah into a tight embrace. "Hannah, if you're ever unhappy,just come home. We'll take care of you."


Raymond didn't speak, but the firm pat on Hannah's shoulder said enough.


Hot tears threatened to spill as Hannah nodded,her heart aching. Her parents had made the long journey out of concern, only to leave with deep worry for her.Self-blame and sorrow pressed down on her as she watched the train roll away.


Once the platform was empty, she finally checked her phone. Right at the top sat a message from Brinley. "You can stop waiting. Vincent won't be joining your family for lunch."

###Chapter 60 Vincent And Brinley At ACouple's Restaurant

Hannah glanced at the message, and a dry laugh escaped her lips. So that was why Vincent didn't come back-because of Brinley, again. She should've known. He had already taken Brinley on an overseas trip without a second thought. Why would he care about her parents?



A sharp pain clutched her chest. It lingered, deep and dull, but she endured it numbly. She suddenly felt the urge to cry. But she held it in. After all, she'd made a silent vow-no more tears wasted on Vincent.


Without pausing by the parked cars, Hannah slid into the driver's seat and steered toward the Jones estate.


Halfway through the drive, Rena's name flashed across the dashboard screen. Instinctively, Hannah figured Rena was calling to check in about the latest  scandal online. The moment she answered, she tried to sound steady. "Don't worry, Rena. I'm fine."


Rena's voice tightened with concern. "Wait, you already know?"


A wrinkle formed between Hannah's brows. That edge in Rena's voice hinted at something else entirely. "What happened?" she asked, keeping her eyes on the road.


Rena wasted no time. "Work sent me to Calveria for a few days. As soon as I finished, I thought I'd treat myself.Guess who I ran into at a couple's restaurant?Brinley and Vincent. Together."


Even with all the bracing she'd done, Hannah's heart skipped a beat before the ache returned. Vincent wouldn't spare time for lunch with her parents, but he had no trouble whisking Brinley off for a cozy meal.How ridiculous.


Rena could barely contain her anger. "Vincent is unbelievable! He's still your husband, yet he's flaunting his affair in another country? What does he take you for? Leave it to me, Hannah. I'll make sure they regret it."


"Rena." Hannah's voice came out a few seconds later, quiet and steady. "Don't ruin their dinner."


"But why shouldn't I? Aren't you upset?" Rena asked,genuinely baffled.


Hannah replied, "I don't see any point in getting worked up." After all, she didn't want Vincent anymore. And she certainly didn't care anymore.


Despite her words, Rena remained unconvinced. "Are you honestly alright? Please, Hannah, just promise me you won't do anything rash because of that scumbag."


Their friendship had its roots in a university competition years ago. Back in those days, Hannah's drive and brilliance had set her apart. She'd built Nova Tech from scratch. That shared commitment to women's empowerment was what brought them together.
Yet, things had changed after Hannah became Vincent's wife, leaving her career behind to focus solely on home and marriage. Rumors had swirled in their circles, painting her as nothing more than Vincent's kept woman. The talk had been vicious,sharpened by envy and spite.


For a long time, Hannah had rarely left the house.Facing the world meant risking the sting of stares and snide remarks, and for a long time, that fear had kept her indoors.


Transformation did not come overnight. In time,though, Hannah gradually discovered her own strength and refused to let people push her around.These days, few dared to test her patience.


No one understood the cost of that battle more than Rena. Empathy made Rena's heart ache for her friend.


A gentle tone slipped into Hannah's words. "promise I'm alright, Rena. There's just one thing |need. Would you take a few photos of them for me?It's important."
Before long, several pictures appeared in Hannah's inbox, showing Brinley and Vincent seated together,facing each other across the table.



Composure never left Hannah. She simply tucked the images away, saying nothing. Her parents had been subjected to an agonizing dinner, all thanks to Vincent, while he was out enjoying dinner with his mistress.



Disgust flickered across Hannah's face, silent but clear.





Rena spoke again. "No way. I won't let him have a pleasant meal."


Rena gave no warning or offered no details. She stayed on the call, and suddenly, the background filled with the lively hum of the restaurant and the crisp echo of footsteps, signaling her approach to Vincent's table.



"Mr. Jones, seems like you're having quite the evening," Rena remarked, her voice light. Vincent's only response was a tight-lipped frown.


A look of confusion swept over Brinley. "And who exactly are you?" she asked.


Rena tossed out a sly grin, her words sharp with sarcasm. "Let's just say crossing me would be your worst idea."



The next second, Hannah heard the sound of a table being flipped over through the phone.


Theatrics poured from Rena next, her voice booming,soaked in exaggerated sobs as she pointed at Vincent. "How can you be out romancing your mistress when my best friend is alone at the hospital,about to have a baby? You absolute scumbag!"


Every ounce of calm in Vincent evaporated on the spot. Ice flickered in his eyes, but the room around him erupted with gossip and curious stares.


A wicked smile curled on Rena's lips as she triedto slip away, only to have her exit blocked by a waiter.She jabbed a finger in Vincent's direction. "See him over there? He'll handle the bill."


As soon as Rena escaped the restaurant, her laughter spilled back through the phone. "Hannah,you should've been there. Vincent looked like he'd swallowed a thundercloud!"



Gratitude shone in Hannah's quiet laugh. "Thanks,Rena." The smile lingered, gentle and real.


They lingered on the call a bit longer, trading a few more words before saying goodbye.


Once alone, Hannah's warmth faded, replaced by resolve as she dialed her attorney. "Have you got everything lined up?" No time remained for excuses -Danica's constant delays had already tested her limits. The property transfer was already set in motion.



Assurance came quickly. "All the paperwork's ready.Just need signatures to finalize everything."


Without hesitation, she said, "I'll come get you now."


Wasting no time, Hannah swung by to pick up her attorney before making a beeline for the Jones estate. The sting of Danica's cruel words to her parents still echoed in her mind. There was no way she would simply let that go.


Once Hannah confirmed that Sharon was resting peacefully, she made straight for Danica's room without a single pause.


Stretched across the bed in a drunken mess, Danica looked oblivious to the world.


Hannah's next move took her to the kitchen, where she filled a hefty jar with cold water and brought it right back. She didn't hesitate as she splashed the water on Danica.


The shock of cold water sent Danica surging upright,choking out a gasp, her hair and clothes drenched.Her eyes landed immediately on Hannah, who stood over her without a flicker of regret.


Fury twisted Danica's face as she dragged a sleeve across her dripping cheeks. "Hannah, what's gotten into you?" she shouted, her voice ragged. An arm came up, ready to strike.


Quick as lightning, Hannah seized Danica's wrist,cutting off the slap before it started. With a sudden movement, she brought the glass jar crashíng down on the floor.


The harsh sound filled the room, making Danica shrink back.


A cold, steady glare met Danica's eyes. "You're always whining about the stench of poverty," Hannah replied. "I figured I'd help you rinse it off."
###Chapter 61 Forced Her To Sign

Hannah released her grip, and Danica stumbled back onto the bed.


With a sneer, Danica tossed her damp hair over her shoulder. "So this is what this is about? Standing up for your parents, I see." She rolled her eyes. "Tell me,did I say anything that wasn't true? Your family's always had nothing. If it weren't for the Jones family,you'd just keep sinking lower."


A steely coldness settled in Hannah's eyes."Appreciate the reminder. With the rest of your properties coming our way, it won't be long before the Scott family is swimming in wealth." After that,she settled herself in a chair and reached out her hand. "Go on, hand over the remaining seven properties."



Danica barely reacted. Instead, she raised her voice so everyone could hear. "What's your hurry? Like I
said before, handing over property doesn't happen in a snap. It's a process, you know."


She couldn't help but add in a mocking tone, "And let's be real, with your family of bookworms, can any of you handle that much money? How about this-we compromise. Since you and Vincent are parting ways, let's keep things friendly. I'll wire you ten million. Think of it as a parting gift from me. Not too shabby, right?" She flashed a broad, fake smile,acting as if she were being generous.


A cold laugh escaped Hannah. Danica honestly believed ten million would be enough to settle this?All those properties together would easily top a billion. Clearly, Danica was only dragging things out-she couldn't bear to hand over the assets she'd invested her year-long savings in.


"Absolutely not," Hannah said, her voice firm. "I want every single property you promised. Nothing less."


Danica's features tightened, and her words turned sharp. "Then there's nothing else to discuss. I've already told you, the transfer takes time. If you want Refusing to let her off the hook, Hannah spelled out the real problem. "You're not dragging this out because of any paperwork. You just can't stand to let go of the properties. You call yourself part of a rich family? You're stingy, and your promises mean nothing."


"You-" Danica stammered, at a loss for any real comeback. Determined not to back down, she steadied herself. "Say whatever you like. I've already explained that the transfer will take time. If you refuse to wait, that's not my fault."


Hannah narrowed her eyes. "Well, if that's how it is..."She glanced toward the doorway and said,"You can come in now."



An attorney, smartly dressed and holding a thick stack of files, entered the room.


A flicker of alarm crossed Danica's features."What are you playing at?"
Hannah responded without a hint of hesitation, "I asked my attorney to come here for a reason. Since you're too busy to process the transfers, I've handled everything for you."


Taking the stack of files, Hannah gave them a small wave in Danica's direction. "There are seven contracts right here, not a single one missing. All you have to do is sign. That way, we stop wasting each other's time."


Danica erupted with outrage. "This is blackmail!"


A humorless chuckle escaped Hannah. "You're something else. You broke your promise and then accuse me of blackmail? Who was it that said-loud and clear-that as long as | divorced Vincent, you'd transfer ten properties into my name? I've already signed the divorce agreement. Now you want to wriggle out of it?"


Forcing herself to appear calm, Danica clung to the hope that Hannah would not dare to push too hard. "I told you l'd give you the properties, and I will," she replied slowly. "Just leave the paperwork here.After Sharon's birthday is over, I'll take care of the signatures. Is that fair?"


Hannah smirked. "That almost sounds reasonable."


Relief crept onto Danica's face. She thought she had managed to buy herself a little more time. Every minute she kept those properties in her name felt like a small victory.


She opened her mouth to say something, but Hannah's tone turned cold. "But I'm done waiting. If you're so unwilling to hand over the properties, just sell them off and give me the cash instead."


A burst of anger shot through Danica. "Have you lost your mind, Hannah? How am I supposed to come up with more than a billion in cash?" All of her wealth was tied up in property.


With her arms crossed, Hannah kept her tone sharp as ice. "It looks like you have no choice but to sign right now."

 
Panic flickered across Danica's face. "I already told you, after Sharon's birthday, I'll sign everything.That's my word."


A steady resolve colored Hannah's answer. "And I already made it clear-I won't be waiting any longer."Her words came out quietly, but there was no room for argument. "Did you think I couldn't tell you were just playing for time?"


A cold scoff escaped Hannah's lips. "I only went along with your little game. You actually thought I believed it? And don't even try to accuse me of blackmail. Every one of these contracts says the transfer is a voluntary gift."


She nodded, and the lawyer, who had stayed quietly nearby, stepped up to arrange the contracts on the table.


Danica recoiled, taking a shaky step back. "Don't you dare force me to sign!"


Hannah's expression didn't budge. "I'm simply collecting what you promised me. What's so wrong with that?"
Defiance crept into Danica's voice. "I refuse to sign!"


At that, Hannah calmly drew two more documents from her bag and set them beside the contracts."These are my divorce agreements with Vincent. If you don't sign, I'll just tear these up instead."

###Chapter 62 Go Win Your Wife Back
Holding back her frustration, Danica kept her voice steady. "Ripping those divorce agreements up won't get you anywhere. Vincent never cared about you.Do you seriously want to stay married to him?"


A cold confidence colored Hannah's words. "That's right. Love doesn't mean much to me anyway. As long as the name Mrs. Jones holds some weight,that's all I'm after." She paused and then continued in a lighter tone, "And since I keep onto that title,there's no way I'm hiding in some secret marriage.The second these divorce agreements are ripped apart, I'll announce to everyone that I'm Vincent's rightful wife."



Disdain twisted Danica's lips. "Who on earth would buy that story? People will just see you as Vincent's mistress."


"Good point," Hannah mused. "Looks like I'll have to
ask Sharon to back me up."


That shut Danica up for a moment.


As Hannah lifted the divorce agreements, ready to tear them in half, panic surged in Danica's voice."Wait-hold on!"



Danica didn't want Hannah to cling to the position as Vincent's wife. Hannah's background disgraced the entire Jones family. If their secret marriage ever got out, the Jones family's reputation would be destroyed.


Even Danica had to admit-Hannah was right on one thing. Keeping the Mrs. Jones title was worth more than any number of properties. It wasn't exactly a bad deal, trading those properties for Vincent's freedom.


Still, parting with those ten properties was painful.Every single one had been carefully selected, from the neighborhood to the floor and the direction of the windows. Danica had poured so much energy into curating them. The thought of giving them all away in one go made her stomach twist. Yet, no matter how much it stung, Hannah had to divorce Vincent. That was the bigger issue. Those properties? She told herself she'd find a way to reclaim them one day.


Her mind made up, Danica gave in. "Fine. I'll sign."


With a tiny nod from Hannah, the attorney stepped forward and guided Danica through every contract.


Soon, the paperwork was finished. Hannah folded the divorce agreements neatly and slipped the signed property transfer contracts away.


A bitter edge sharpened Danica's final words. "Don't you forget what you promised me."


Hannah replied, "You don't need to worry. I'm nothing like you. When I make a promise, I keep it."The decision to divorce Vincent was already set in stone. If Danica hadn't gone after her parents so harshly, things never would have come to this.


Left with nothing else to discuss, Hannah gathered her things and went straight to work at Nova Tech. By the time her shift ended, she chose not to return to the Jones family home. Her car took her instead to Lakeshore Villa, where she threw out the things she didn't want, packed up what mattered, texted Sharon about not returning, and then set off for Sterling Heights. There was no sense pretending to be the loving wife when Vincent was overseas, busy with another woman.







Dorbarrow's city lights greeted Vincent and Brinley as their plane landed at eight in the evening.


Doctors in Calveria had assured them that Brinley's health had improved. She only needed to avoid strong emotions and take her pills on time to prevent her heart condition from returning.


Brinley thought about hosting a celebration, but before she could make plans, Vincent's phone rang.Sharon's voice left no room for argument-she ordered him to come home right away.


Inside the Jones estate, Sharon sat on the living room sofa, cane in hand and a look that would brook no nonsense.



Vincent's eyes searched the space, but Hannah was nowhere to be found. A deep crease formed on his brow. It puzzled him-where else could Hannah be at this hour?



"So you do remember where home is?" Sharon's cane hit the floor with a loud thump. "Hannah's parents traveled all this way just to see you.l reminded you over and over again. And what did you do? You ignored them. Now look-Hannah was so upset that she didn't even come home tonight."


Vincent froze.



A furious glare flashed in Sharon's eyes. Her grip tightened around her cane, and she lifted it, ready to strike Vincent.



Brinley moved quickly, jumping in front of Vincent."Sharon, don't be angry with Vincent-he only missed dinner because of me..."
Vincent's hand came up, cutting her off before she could say another word. Tall and steady, he faced Sharon without so much as a flinch. His face stayed calm, but his tone softened just enough. "You're right. I didn't handle this well. I'll speak with Hannah and explain everything."


He didn't want Sharon to get stressed about Brinley's heart condition.


Hearing the apology, Sharon's glare softened just a bit. "Then go make things right with your wife tomorrow."


Vincent pressed his lips into a tight line and kept silent. Thinking about Hannah only gave him a headache. She seemed to have a shorter fuse than ever these days.
###Chapter 63 Unexpected Encounter
A short while after the tension in the living room,Brinley headed straight for Danica's room.


Lying on the bed, Danica still simmered with anger over losing her properties. She stared at the ceiling,appetite gone and food untouched. Spotting Brinley at the door, a faint spark of hope stirred inside her.The complaints poured out. "Hannah walked away with all ten properties. All of them! Everything I've invested is gone just like that."


A shadow crossed Brinley's face. "She really is insatiable. But you can count on me. I'll make sure you get every single one back."


Brinley was pissed off. Hannah was getting divorced.She was about to be officially out of the Jones family.What right did she have to claim so much of their assets? A substitute like her? She didn't deserve that much.

"Are you serious?" Danica asked, hope flickering in her voice. "So what are you going to do?"


Leaning in close, Brinley whispered her plan.






Over at Sterling Heights, Hannah didn't spare a thought for the Jones estate. All of her attention was on the funds she had finally secured.


Her company with Felix was in its make-or-break stage, and the expenses were pilingup quickly.Sooner or later, she'd build a partnership with Miles,which would only add to the financial strain.


Nothing had been left to chance. Hannah mapped out a detailed financial strategy and handed it off to her team for implementation.


Vincent's "compensation," the ten million he wired her days before, remained untouched in her account.Kicking back on the couch, Hannah actually felt a rare calm and even looked forward to the future.


There was a time when just the idea of leaving
Vincent would have left her sobbing. Now, she stood on the edge of a new life: her marriage almost over,a place of her own, and a career that mattered. What could possibly/ top this feeling? The countdown was on. Nine days left, and everything with Vincent would finally be over.


Drowsiness was just starting to settle in when a faint meow came from the doorway.


Pulling the door open, Hannah found a cat waiting outside, its coat smooth and well-groomed,clearly someone's beloved pet.


She paused for a second, then scooped the cat into her arms and carried it inside. Quickly, she sent a message to the building's resident group chat,saying, "Did anyone lose a cat?" She included a photo of the cat with her message.


Gentle and affectionate, the animal pressed its head into her palm as if it had always belonged there.


Time slipped by as Hannah waited for someone to reply, and before she realized it, she drifted off to sleep with the cat curled up warmly in her arms.


Her nap didn't last long. A loud knock jolted her awake. Still half-asleep, she went to the door and pulled it open. She froze. Beside the building manager stood a man she recognized immediately.It was Miles Whitaker. His expression was unreadable as he stared right at her.


Surprise flickered across Hannah's face. "Mr.Whitaker? Why are you here?"


A sharp squint from Miles followed. She seemed oddly familiar, yet he couldn't quite remember where he'd seen her. That casual way she greeted him made his stomach knot. Predictable, he thought.Women always acted like this around him.


Earlier that evening, Miles had seen the group chat message and soon realized his apartment door had been left open, letting the cat slip out. He had answered in the group char straight away.


With no one replying, he'd checked the building's security cameras-sure enough, the woman from downstairs had picked up his cat. He had come to knock once, but no one answered. So he'd returned with the building manager.


Now, looking at her eager smile, a flicker of contempt crossed his face. How could she even know where he lived? The whole situation was absurd. She must be desperate to get his attention.


"Cat," Miles said, his tone short and clipped.


Understanding dawned for Hannah. "Oh-it's yours?Give me a second. I'll go bring it right out."


Just as she turned to go back inside, Hannah paused for a moment. Encounters with someone like Miles didn't come around often, and she didn't want to let the opportunity slip by. With a hesitant smile, she asked, "Mr. Whitaker, would you have any interest in talking about a business opportunity?"


A deeper scowl crossed Miles's face. "Not interested," he replied flatly.


That cold response left Hannah feeling a bit awkward. She stepped inside, gently scooped up the cat, and brought it over to the door. As she handed the animal over, Miles suddenly started sneezing,one after another.


Curiosity got the better of her. "Wait... Are you allergic to cats?"


His answer came quick and sharp. "That's not your concern," he snapped,reaching for the cat.


At the last second, Hannah drew back. "If you're allergic, Mr. Whitaker, maybe having a cat isn't the best idea," she suggested, keeping her voice even.


A sharp look cut across Miles's face. "Now you're giving me advice?" His brows knit together,annoyance clear.


The little kitten voiced a meow.


Holding in a sigh, Hannah kept her composure. "It's not my intention to lecture you. I just wanted to say that people with cat allergies sometimes develop asthma if they're around cats all the time. That's all- I thought it was worth mentioning, both for your health and the cat's well-being."


Without another word, Miles took the kitten and turned away. He sneezed once more and muttered to the cat, "Spend a little time with a stranger and you already forget who feeds you, huh?"


Watching him walk off, Hannah murmured, "So much for trying to be helpful..."


Even with such a brief exchange, she could tell Miles wasn't the easiest person to approach. It made her wonder if working with him would ever be possible.


Her phone buzzed just then. Vincent's name flashed on the screen. She pressed decline without a second thought.

###Chapter 64 Someone Was Out ThereUsing Her Old Identity

Vincent tried calling again, but Hannah didn't even flinch-she blocked his number right away.


A few moments later, just as Hannah was about to wash her face, her phone rang once more. This time,Rena's name lit up the screen. Hannah answered without a second thought. "Rena, are you back in the country?"


A playful and bright voice answered, "Yep!"


Then,Rena added, "Oh, and by the way, do you know Victoria Hale?"


Hannah stopped in her tracks the moment she heard the name. "What's got you bringing up Victoria all of a sudden?" she asked.


Victoria Hale had been Hannah's own alias during her college days, long before Vincent was part of her That part of her life had been her proudest. As Victoria, she'd built and launched a pioneering website to help keep women safe. But the attention it attracted had soon turned sour. Online trolls and anonymous threats had spilled over into her real life,eventually forcing her to give up the alias. Still, she had never given up on the concept of women's safety design. Afterward, she'd partnered with Felix and founded Nova Tech.


The day Hannah re-entered the tech world, Felix had encouraged her to go public as Victoria. But she'd turned down the idea. The past belonged behind her.She didn't want to cash in on an old name. What mattered now was building something real-something current.


Still buzzing, Rena continued, "There's a big business gala tomorrow at Cloudspire Center. My dad told me Victoria's on the guest list. Every major player from every industry is going to be there."


A dark cloud settled over Hannah's face. She had never received an invitation.


"Hello? Hannah? Are you still there?" Rena called out a few times before Hannah came back to the moment.


Hannah asked hesitantly, "Hey, Rena... Is an invitation needed for that event?"


Excitement filled Rena's voice. "Absolutely. I had a feeling you'd want to go, so I have already asked my dad for extra invitations."


She added enthusiastically, "With all those business heavyweights showing up, it's a perfect chance for you to get your face out there."


"Thanks, Rena. You're the best," Hannah replied, her smile genuine. Eight years had brought plenty of regret-marrying Vincent among them-but making friends with Rena had never been one of those mistakes.



After hanging up, Hannah searched online for information about the event. She learned that the  gala took place every two years, always centered on some headline-grabbing theme. For this year, all eyes were on the elusive and much-talked-about Victoria Hale.


A chill swept over Hannah's face. Someone was out there using her old identity.


The following morning, Hannah brushed on a bit of makeup and slipped into her go-to business suit before heading out the door.


Rena swung by Sterling Heights to pick Hannah up and instantly frowned at the sight of her outfit."Hannah, come on. That look is way too plain for tonight."


Settling into the back seat, Hannah finally noticed Rena's formal gown. Surprise flickered across her face. "Hold on... Isn't this supposed to be a business event?"



A small sigh escaped Rena. "It is, kind of. But it's also a fancy dinner," she explained, a note of frustration in her voice. "You mean you really didn't know?"
Of course, Hannah didn't. Vincent had never brought her along to one of these galas. She was completely out of the loop.


"I honestly had no idea," Hannah admitted. First time or not, she realized she needed to look the part. A glance at her watch told her there was still plenty of time before the event. An idea sparked right away."There's a boutique near Cloudspire Center. Want to help me pick out something more appropriate?"


A bright smile spread across Rena's face. "I'd love to!" She couldn't resist giving Hannah·a playful tap on the nose. "You know how much I enjoy being your stylist."


Inside the boutique, the racks held plenty of nice dresses, but none of the sales assistants even bothered to greet them.


Hannah brushed off the indifference. She checked the time again, determined to choose something quickly and make it to the event on time. A handful of dresses caught her eye, and she started toward the fitting rooms.
But Rena stopped her in her tracks. "The really high-end pieces are never left out front."


She had to call out a few times before a sales assistant finally appeared, looking anything but enthusiastic to help. "Welcome. But just so you're aware, we don't permit anyone to try on dresses if they're wearing makeup."


Rena pulled out her sleek VIP card, black and gold,and lifted her chin with confidence. "Show us your priciest gowns."


Instantly, the sales assistant's demeanor shifted.Respect colored her words now. "Absolutely.Which one of you will be doing the fittings?"


A step forward put Hannah in front. "I will," she replied. "I'm searching for something with an elegant touch."


A gesture led them forward. "This way, ladies.You'll be able to browse our exclusive collection," the sales assistant assured, leading them toward the VIP lounge.
 A quiet laugh slipped out as Rena glanced around."Let's hope the dresses aren't as tacky as the ones out front."



"Not at all," the sales assistant responded eagerly, a sweet smile fixed on her face. "These pieces are the best we have. You'll be impressed."


Without hesitation, they followed the sales assistant into the luxurious VIP lounge.


Inside, the selection spoke for itself. Rena's gaze landed on one dress in particular-a mint green number that hugged the waist just right. Simple but refined, it was the sort of dress that showed off a lovely figure.


"Try this one, Hannah," Rena remarked, her eyes bright with excitement.


Hannah gave a small, trusting smile. She never doubted Rena's taste. "Okay, I'lI give it a go."


The sales assistant quickly took the dress off the rack and handed it to Hannah.
 Hannah was only a step from the fitting room when another customer came into view. A glance upward stopped her in place.


Brinley walked out, a cluster of sales assistants following behind. She wore an extravagant white dress, and the headpiece she'd chosen was so elaborate that it almost passed for a wedding veil.

###Chapter 65 Accompanying TheMistress To Try On WeddingDresses

A flicker of surprise crossed Brinley's face when she spotted Hannah-what reason did Hannah have to be here?


But curiosity quickly shifted. Brinley's gaze slid tothe woman beside Hannah, and it took only a heartbeat to recognize her as the same person who had disrupted that romantic dinner back in Calveria.


Brinley quickly pieced it together. Since Hannah knew that woman, she must be behind the disruption at the restaurant. The whole scene had probably been orchestrated by her.


That realization made Brinley's blood boil, and she shot Hannah and her friend a look that could freeze the air.

 Rena was never one to stay silent. Her eyes narrowed at the sight of Brinley's gown, and her voice cut through the room. "They're still legally married, and you're already trying on a wedding gown? You really don't waste any time, do you? Where's Vincent hiding-trying not to get caught?"


All at once, the sales assistants stiffened, unsure if they should jump to serve their VIP client or just watch the fireworks. The way things looked, they might be witnessing a scandal unfold right before their eyes.


Not a word left Hannah's lips as she met Brinley's glare with a cold stare. She doubted Vincent was anywhere nearby-he never had the patience to sit around while someone tried on outfits.


Brinley's eyes turned stormy. "You should watch what you say."


Rena retorted sharply, "Oh, drop the act. Once a mistress, always a mistress. Even if Hannah signs the divorce papers, that won't change who you are. l'd honestly love to see what Vincent has to say about that."


With that, Rena strode over to a closed fitting room,not bothering to hide her contempt.


Brinley lifted the hem of her dress, trying to block her. "Don't cause a scene!"


That sudden movement triggered the sales assistants, who all rushed forward to stop any potential chaos.


A glance at her phone reminded Hannah she had better things to do. She had no interest in arguing with Brinley and certainly didn't want to deal with Vincent. "Just leave it, Rena. She isn't worth the trouble. We should just-"



Before Hannah could finish, Rena swung open one of the doors, and there was Vincent. Inside, he lounged as if he owned the place, speaking smoothly while leading what was obviously a meeting with people from different countries.


When someone barged in, he didn't even flinch-justlifted his eyes, calm and detached.


A mocking laugh slipped out of Rena. "Bravo, Mr.Jones. You've really perfected the cheating husband routine-even hiding out in a fitting room."


Brinley darted over and tried to drag Rena back."You're disrupting his meeting. Leave now."


Anger flared in Rena's eyes. "Who in their right mind holds a meeting here? Hiding in a fitting room while your mistress gets fitted for a wedding dress? Real classy,Vincent."


The sales staff hovered nearby, torn between doing their jobs and watching the spectacle unfold.


Humiliated and angry, Brinley raised her hand, ready to slap Rena.


That slap never happened-Hannah stepped forward,placing herself in front of Rena and catching Brinley's wrist mid-swing. Her words were as cold as steel."You think you can just hit people? I guess the word 'mistress' stings a bit."
"Let go!" Brinley exclaimed, her cheeks flushed with rage.


Hannah squeezed a little tighter before abruptly letting go, which sent Brinley stumbling backward.


Brinley didn't hit the ground, though-Vincent was there in a heartbeat, steadying her before she could fall.


Looking every inch the polished CEO in his custom suit, Vincent and Brinley, in her sweeping white gown, almost looked picture-perfect. To anyone watching,they seemed made for each other.


Vincent's eyes were filled with icy annoyance when he met Hannah's gaze.


All Hannah could do was sneer. A romantic getaway abroad just days ago, and now he was back,wasting no time playing dress-up with his mistress. In five years of their marriage, she had never experienced even a fraction of this.



A bitter smile crossed Hannah's lips as she met his  eyes head-on. "Well, Mr. Jones, you seem to have plenty of time for wedding dress shopping with your mistress. Did you forget about one small thing-our divorce?"
###Chapter 66 Perhaps You Should Get Moving On Our Divorce
Hannah spoke sharply, and Vincent's expression darkened with a hard frown. After making sure Brinley was steady on her feet, he turned to face Hannah and asked in a voice stripped of warmth,"How many times do I have to say it? I told you to quit talking about divorce. Haven't you thrown enough tantrums?"


Initially, Vincent had thought it was best to just give Hannah the silent treatment for a while-they'd been arguing too often lately, always over Brinley. But he hadn't expected Hannah to chase him down here and even make a scene.



A quiet satisfaction flickered across Brinley's face.She knew Vincent would take her side, no matter what.


Rena couldn't take it anymore and marched forward,
pointing right at Vincent. "You call this throwing a tantrum? Maybe take a look in the mirror. You and your lover started all this, but suddenly it's out of bounds to point that out?"


Not even bothering to acknowledge Rena, Vincent replied, "This doesn't concern you. Stay out of it.You're just an outsider."


That was enough to silence Rena, at least for a moment.


Hannah stepped protectively in front of her friend and let out a low, bitter laugh. "Then go ahead and talk to me. I'm not an outsider,aml?"



Whatever Hannah once felt for Vincent had finally faded away. Not a single drop of hope remained in her for him now. She gazed up at Vincent, a distant smile formed on her lips. "Since you've already brought her here to try on wedding dresses, perhaps you should get moving on our divorce."


Vincent's face grew stormy as he caught Hannah's wrist. "I told you, don't bring up divorce again."
Brinley glanced sideways at Vincent, momentarily surprised. So he was the one who didn't want the divorce? No, that couldn't be right. The way he cared for her didn't feel fake. Maybe he was just embarrassed by the confrontation.


Hannah let out a derisive smirk. Vincent had always been like this, claiming one thing while his actions suggested otherwise. The very man who resisted divorce was now parading another woman around,helping her choose wedding dresses. The irony was almost laughable.


Wrenching her wrist free, Hannah fixed him with a cold stare.



With just that look, Vincent felt the distance between them widen even further. He had been noticing her grow more indifferent toward him lately. He'd thought giving her the cold shoulder for a couple of days would make her panic and soften her approach toward her, maybe even going back to their past dynamics. However, after three long days apart, he found she seemed completely unfazed. Nothing about her reaction matched what he had imagined.


A flash of annoyance crossed Vincent's face as he tugged at his tie, searching for relief.


Not wanting to drag things out, Hannah lost all desire to try on that soft green dress anymore. She handed the gown to an assistant and headed straight to the register to pay.


From the register all the way to the exit, she never once turned to glance at Vincent.



Vincent's mood darkened.



Brinley reached out and softly took his hand. "Please don't be upset, Vincent. Hannah just gets the wrong idea.I'll try to explain things to her."


Finally, Vincent's gaze landed on Brinley.


Brinley caught his gaze and spun with a grin. "Well?What do you think, Vincent?"


A sharp edge crept into his voice as he replied, "Take it off."
That response left Brinley frozen, confusion written across her face. "What... What did you just say?"


Cold and unwavering, Vincent answered, "Wedding dresses aren't something you should be trying on."


Attending the Cloudspire Center gala was never high on Vincent's list. He'd only said yes because Brinley wanted his company, and her role as the manager required her to keep up appearances at these events. She'd asked for his help with gown shopping,and he'd agreed, thinking it was harmless. Now,standing here, he was caught off guard by how things had turned out.


Seeing his mood shift, Brinley quickly softened her tone, letting a bit of sadness show. "I'm sorry,Vincent. The dress just looked so pretty, and l wanted to try it on. That was all. I had no other intentions. I only wanted to know what I'd look like in a wedding gown. With my condition, I'm afraid I might not make it to my big day. I just thought maybe my dad and brother would like to see me dressed like this."

The tension from Vincent's expression softened,his jaw set with tension. "So, which one did you like?"
###Chapter 67 She's Victoria Hale


By the time the clock struck four, professionals from every corner of the business world had started filling Cloudspire Center.

Trailing after Rena and her father, Hannah found herself introduced to several key players from various industries. She understood well that most were only willing to exchange polite greetings because of the influence wielded by Brown Bank.

Even with that knowledge, Hannah treasured this opportunity. This evening marked the first time she'd truly seen how different this crowd was from her old life as a housewife.

With steady confidence, Hannah remarked, "Nova Tech will be a name everyone knows one day."

Glancing around the hall, she noticed plenty of skeptical and dismissive looks aimed her way. None of it bothered her, since she understood that this was just something she had to face. She quietly raised her champagne and took a sip.

Out of nowhere, a woman's voice cut through the noise. "Beautifully said." Her glass lifted in Hannah's direction, a warm smile on her face.

Hannah's gaze traveled upward, just as Rena leaned in and whispered, "That's Ms. Sloane Hadley-she's famous in the world of industrial business."

Moving through the crowd, Sloane's words carried both strength and encouragement. "I always appreciate the ambitious type."

Hannah was a little caught off guard by the praise. "Thank you, Ms. Hadley."

With a pat on Hannah's shoulder, Sloane suggested, "Let's swap numbers. I want to know about Nova Tech.Your company seems promising."

Right away, Hannah reached for her phone and exchanged contacts with Sloane, pleasantly surprised.Sloane was the first major figure she had connected with this evening. She lifted her glass once more."Thank you, Ms. Hadley. I promise you, Nova Tech will live up to your expectations."

Seeing the way Sloane welcomed Hannah, Rena could not hide her excitement. She clinked glasses with her friend several times, happy for her.

At that very moment, commotion broke out near the entrance.

Glancing in the direction of the uproar, Hannah spotted a man at the center-Miles had arrived.

The crowd, instantly drawn to Miles, gathered in close, eager for his attention.

Hannah didn't even try to push through. She held back, fully aware of her place in the room.

Rena glanced over and suddenly brightened, as if an idea struck her. She leaned close and whispered,"Hannah, have you ever wondered why someone like Miles would bother coming to an event like this?"

Hannah's brow furrowed in confusion. "Isn't this a business event? Since he's a big name now, I figured it made sense for him to be here."

"That's not it at all," Rena replied, shaking her head. "Usually, people like him would never show up for a minor gathering like this."

Dropping her voice even lower, Rena continued,"My dad told mne Miles is actually here because of Victoria-the founder behind that women's empowerment website. Five years ago, she created those sonic self-defense earrings that sold like crazy-no one's topped those sales since. My dad's tried recruiting her for ages, but Victoria remained elusive and hard to reach."

A part of Hannah wanted to admit she was actually Victoria right then. It wasn't exactly a secret worth guarding anymore.

But before she could say a word, a spotlight swept over the main stage, and the evening's host stepped up,script in hand. "Ladies and gentlemen," the host announced, his voice echoing through the room. "I know you have all been eagerly awaiting Victoria Hale. She's arrived backstage."

Hannah's gaze grew colder, fixed on the center of the stage.

The host lifted his voice with flair and instructed the crowd, "It's time to put your hands together for Victoria Hale!"

Rena clutched Hannah's hand in excitement."Oh my god!"

Lights shifted overhead as applause filled the hall. A woman in a white dress walked out, beaming,her arm entwined with a sharply dressed man.
Hannah and Rena both froze in shock when they saw Brinley's face.
 
###Chapter 68 Looks Like Wedding Bells Are On The Way


Rena's face twisted with disgust as she eyed Brinley. "Ugh. Why is it her?"

A buzz of chatter quickly spread through the crowd.

"Victoria is quite something else. Mr. Jones shows up for her sake."

"Looks like you all missed the news. Rumor has it that she was his first love, and now they're getting married."

"You can't be serious.For real?"

"As real as it gets. Search Mr. Jones' name online if you doubt me. Not long ago, his mistress made quite a stir online, targeting his first love. That mess was everywhere. What really surprised me is that the so-called first love turns out to be Victoria. With Victoria by Mr. Jonee's side, the Jones Group seems unstoppable."

Up on the stage, Brinley reached for themicrophone and gave the crowd a bright smile. "It's been a while since I saw all of you. l, Victoria Hale, am back." Her expression was full of excitement. "And my real name is Brinley Gilbert. I hope you'll all remember that."

The audience burst into cheers and clapping.

"Gee! Just the sight of her smug face makes my blood boil," Rena muttered through gritted teeth.

Hannah glared at Brinley, her eyes icy, astonished by Brinley's audacity to steal her hidden identity as Victoria and even make such a statement in public so brazenly.

"I want to apologize for being away for the past months," Brinley added, her voice ringing with emotion. "I had to deal with some health problems, but I'm feeling much better now. I've grown a lot during that time.From here on, I will focus on creating better safety products for women."

She spoke louder to make sure everyone heard her. "I owe so much to Mr. Jones. Since I came back from abroad, he's given me the best possible platform-Polaris Tech. This company is my fresh start. I hope, with his support, I can reach new heights."

While saying this, she sent Vincent a look full of admiration.

Rena shook with anger. She felt like charging toward the stage to expose Brinley's shamelessness, but Hannah quickly held her arm to keep her back.

"Hannah, you're not mad? They're flaunting their affair like you don't even exist! I'm fuming!" Rena hissed.

"Of course, I am furious," Hannah replied, her eyes growing even darker. But what truly set her off had nothing to do with their blatant display onstage. Watching Brinley parade around using her name Victoria was what pushed her over the edge. Brinley must bet that Victoria would never show up to expose her lies.

Calm and steady, Hannah kept her eyes fixed on the stage. "Just wait. The farther Brinley climbs, the harder it will be when she falls."

Rena was still seething and didn't notice the subtle change in Hannah's tone. "I just can't accept it. How could someone like Brinley possibly be Victoria?"

Hannah turned to her, arching a brow. "You really like Victoria, don't you?"

Rena hesitated for a second before admitting, "Not really. I just picked up some info about her from my dad.A woman that capable would never stoop to be a homewrecker."

Rena's attention went back to Brinley, who was soaking up the crowd's cheers. "Check Brinley's face. She's grinning so wide that you can see every wrinkle."

Hannah kept staring at the stage. Seeing Brinley bask in all that attention only made her feel the situation was even more absurd. Vincent would go out of his way to support Brinley's career, even attending events he clearly disliked just to back her.

Hannah had to suppress a bitter laugh at Vincent's approach toward her. He'd once insisted she should leave her job and settle into being a housewife. He'd even said to others that she never needed to work a day in her life, clearly a statement masking his unwillingness to support her career as he did for Brinley. How irony.

Turning away, Hannah finished off the champagne in her glass in one go.

It was then that Brinley and Vincent started walking over.

Close by, Hannah caught a playful remark. "Looks like we'll be hearing wedding bells soon for Mr. Jones and Miss Gilbert."

Brinley blushed and let out a shy laugh, staying silent instead of denying it.

Vincent appeared a little uncomfortable and seemed like he was about to respond, but a sharp female voice interrupted before he could.

Raising her voice loud enough for everyone to hear, Rena called out, "Mr. Jones, you changed your partner so quickly. I wonder how long this Miss Gilbert will stick around."

###Chapter 69 Questioned Her Identity


Very few people had ever challenged Vincent so openly. With a shaky hand, Gordon Brown, Rena's father,wiped sweat from his brow and gently pulled his daughter a step closer to him.

Vincent cast a cold glance at Rena. Without even sparing Gordon a look, he said, his voice low and heavy,"Mr. Brown, your daughter seems to need a reminder about when it's her turn to speak-and when silence would serve her better."

Quick to nod, Gordon rushed to agree. "You're right. I'Il make sure to discipline her properly. Rena, you need to apologize this instant."

His desperate glance at her begged for cooperation, but Rena acted ignorant of her father's unspoken message.

Rena shifted her head away and huffed, "I didn't say anything wrong. Why should I have to apologize at all?"

Vincent's expression barely changed as he looked at Rena. His voice was stripped of emotion. "In that case,the Browns should consider their partnership with the Jones Group over."

He turned on his heel and left, making no effort to hide his disdain.

"Wait, Mr.Jones!" Panic drove Gordon to chase after Vincent, dragging Rena with him.

Frozen in place, Hannah felt her heart turn cold. Vincent was clearly lashing out, punishing her by targeting the Browns. Determined to make things right, she slipped after Vincent, searching for even a small chance to talk. The Browns couldn't afford to lose this contract because of her.

But Brinley guided Vincent through the crowd so smoothly that Hannah never got close. Instead, her breath caught at what happened next.

Miles, the very person Hannah had hoped to cooperate with, extended a hand to Brinley with an easy smile."Victoria, I've heard so much about you. Meeting you at last feels long overdue."

Brinley was momentarily stunned by the striking man in front of her.

Vincent murmured to her, "This is Miles Whitaker, CEO of VitraMind."

Brinley quickly recovered and remarked, "It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr.Whitaker."

Miles nodded, and his assistant, Kenneth, handed her a business card. "I have a strong interest in women's safety innovations. Hopefully, we'll find an opportunity to collaborate soon."

Brinley couldn't hide her delight as she accepted the business card with both hands. "I appreciate that so much,"she said.

Brinley turned to Vincent, whose eyes were shining with approval. Attending this event had turned out to be the right choice, surpassing her expectations.

Hannah took a quiet breath and pushed through the crowd. "Miss Gilbert, you claim you're Victoria. Do you have anything to prove it?"

The question rattled Brinley, and for an instant, panic flashed across her face.

A sidelong look from Miles revealed that he recognized Hannah as the neighbor from downstairs-the one who'd made a point to get close.

A champagne flute dangled from Vincent's hand as he fixed Hannah with a cold stare. "This isn't the moment for dramatics," he said, his tone biting.

Disregarding his warning, Hannah pressed on. "Last I checked, Victoria carries a seal engraved with her name. Do you have it, Miss Gilbert?"

Regaining her composure quickly, Brinley answered, "Yes... Yes, I have it."

Interest piqued, Miles, Sloane, and a handful of other guests now watched Brinley closely.

Vincent's eyes, however, stayed fixed on Hannah.

With a sly little smile, Hannah asked, "Is that so? In that case, would you mind showing it to us?"

An unamused look flickered on Brinley's face. "You really expect me to carry it to an event like this?"

Keeping her voice even, Brinley continued, "You questioned my identity in front of everyone, and I agree that proof is needed. I'd hate for someone else to take Victoria's name for themselves."

A laugh escaped Hannah, edged with sarcasm. She couldn't believe Brinley was actually suggesting she had bad intentions. The nerve of Brinley stealing her identity as Victoria while throwing accusations her way.

Hannah had just opened her mouth to argue when Brinley held up her phone. "If I weren't truly Victoria,how would I have been talking to those from the women's empowerment website all this time? Take a look for yourselves!"

###Chapter 70 Not Interested In Working With Someone Like You


Brinley held up her phone for everyone to see, the screen displaying a series of chat screenshots. "I might have kept my name out of the spotlight all these years, but I've always stayed in touch with the women on the website. Every year, I reach out," she said.

The device made its way from hand to hand among the crowd, drawing curious looks. Comments rippled through the room.

"These screenshots look real to me. The dates are all there-she's been keeping in contact for years."

"That seal must be ancient history. Maybe Miss Gilbert just forgot it."

"Could be. And come on, with Mr. Jones personally backing her-how could she not be the real deal?"

"Thinking back, Victoria's rise was so sudden... Makes you wonder if the Jones Group had her back from the start."

"You know, that's probably it."

The crowd gradually accepted Brinley's claim.

Brinley shot Hannah a smug glance, her expression triumphant.

Meeting that look with only a faint smile, Hannah replied, "Your evidence is certainly convincing.I suppose there's no question now-you really are Victoria. That means you've also got the custom seal. Am I right?"

Brinley, pleased by Hannah's apparent concession,lifted her chin. "Of course, I do. Something that valuable has always been in my care."

At that, Miles furrowed his brow and gave Brinley a sidelong glance.

Hannah's lips curved into a subtle, icy smile. Did Brinley really think she could pass herself off as Victoria without even doing her homework? Her tone turned cool and sharp. "That's interesting because the real Victoria never owned a seal with her name on it."

A wave of shock rooted Brinley to the spot.

Slowly, Hannah angled her head, her tone even and steady. "If you were truly Victoria, wouldn't you know this? Years ago, so-called 'official Victoria seals' started popping up for sale. People scrambled to get their hands on them. But Victoria wasted no time and immediately made it clear-she never approved any of it.She issued a public denial for all to see."

Reason guided Hannah's words. Her voice was measured and quiet, but the weight behind it was unmistakable. Murmurs rippled through the crowd as uncertainty began to take hold.

Brinley's fists tightened at her sides. Her jaw clenched as she hadn't expected Hannah to turn the tables by setting her up.

Vincent, who'd been watching Hannah, slowly redirected his focus to Brinley. His features gave nothing away.



Catching his eye, Brinley straightened her posture and moved to face him. Relief crept in when his gaze revealed no clear sign of disappointment or disdain. She explained in a rush, "I meant well then. Those imitation seals were ridiculously expensive. Buyers snapped them up because of me. I just didn't think it was right."

Wanting to sound sincere, she added, "Honesty, I was just looking out for everyone else."

The corners of Hannah's mouth curled as she started to clap her hands slowly. She didn't break eye contact with Brinley. "How thoughtful of you. Since you remember that, I'm sure you can also recall exactly what Victoria said in her official statement."

Looking away, Brinley's confidence faltered. "It was just something like telling people not to buy, wasn't it?"

"Oh?" Hannah stepped forward, narrowing the gap between them.

Brinley retreated almost automatically. "I... I'm not certain of the exact words."

"Not sure, huh?" Hannah's gaze sharpened, her words icy and pointed."Or maybe you just never were Victoria at all?"

No answer came from Brinley. Her lips moved, but nothing escaped. The crowd's whispers picked up,feeding her anxiety and making the room feel smaller.

Panic nearly overwhelmed Brinley as she found herself pinned against the bar-until Vincent intervened,reaching out to move her safely aside.

Vincent's voice sliced through the tension. "That's enough, Hannah," he said, his tone icy.
Hannah stopped in her tracks as she caught the unmistakable protectiveness in Vincent's stance. With a slight tug at her lips, she let a cool smile surface. "Mr. Jones, I'm only pressing Miss Gilbert for a little clarification, just to keep things transparent for everyone here. Yet, you're so quick to defend her-don't you think you're overdoing it?"

A shadow flickered across Vincent's face.

Unfazed, Hannah held his gaze, refusing to back down.

Brinley bit her lip, feeling the weight of all the eyes fixed on her. Her heart raced wildly. Suddenly,she pressed her hand to her chest, squeezed her eyes shut, and collapsed straight into Vincent's arms.

A wave of shock spread through the onlookers. "What just happened?"

Vincent's expression darkened. He sent Hannah a blistering look, scooped Brinley up, and strode out of the room without so much as a word to anyone else.

The room quickly descended into chaos, with guests demanding an explanation.

Sweat gathered on the event organizer's brow as he tried to reassure the crowd, "Miss Gilbert is Victoria, I assure you!" But as more doubts were raised, his confidence visibly faltered.

A smirk threatened at the edges of Hannah's expression as she watched Vincent disappear with Brinley.The entire display struck her as nothing short of absurd.

Pivoting away, Hannah caught sight of Miles already making for the door. Wasting no time, she moved to catch up. "Mr.Whitaker,wait."

Miles turned, his expression barely concealing his impatience the moment he saw her.

Hannah offered her business card. "I overheard you earlier-your interest in female safety products. My team is currently-"

"I'm not interested in working with someone like you," Miles cut her off flatly.

###Chapter 71 Take Five Percent Off


Hannah's polite smile faltered for a second. Conflicting feelings surged-hurt, annoyance, and the sharp sting of being wrongly judged. What exactly did Miles mean by "someone like you?" The words echoed,heavier than she'd expected. Never had she imagined the man she'd met only twice would have already slapped a label on her, making sweeping assumptions about her character.

Despite that sting, Hannah straightened and smoothed her expression. She spoke with poise. "Perhaps there's been a misunderstanding-"

Yet, Miles refused to hear her out. Without so much as a glance, he strode away.

Hannah gathered up her dress and picked up the pace to catch up. She moved in front of him, walking backward to match his pace. "Listen, Mr. Whitaker, mny abilities match Brinley's, if not exceed them. Give Nova Tech one shot-I'll even sweeten the deal. Take five percent off, plus an even split on the profits. You won't regret it."

A low, mirthless laugh escaped Miles as he halted. His eyes glinted with equal parts amusement and challenge. "That's gutsy. Tell me, do you realize what five percent actually means in a deal like this?"

Numbers and bottom lines weren't lost on Hannah. Granting such a discount would eat into Nova Tech's margins, barely leaving enough after development and production. Still, she held his gaze without flinching.She answered with resolve, "Five percent represents commitment. The real question is-are you open to seeing what we can do?"

Something about her fierce confidence gave Miles pause. For a brief moment, he hesitated. But his silence stretched,and without a word, he sidestepped her, vanishing into the crowd.

Not long after, Miles settled into his Porsche and addressed Kenneth without turning his head, "Find out everything about Nova Tech."

"Understood. Is this for a new partnership?"

"No," Miles answered, his voice cold enough to freeze steel. He just wanted to know what kind of company dared to offer him terms like that.

Elsewhere, Derek gripped the steering wheel, pressing harder on the gas as sweat trickled down his temple.Every nerve was on edge. His boss looked ready to explode.

In the backseat, Vincent ripped his tie loose, hands trembling with agitation. His thoughts spiraled into chaos.

He'd heard the name "Victoria Hale" back in college. It had floated around a few times, but he'd never cared enough to dig deeper. He didn't even know what exactly Victoria did.

So, when Brinley revealed she was Victoria, he'd been a little surprised-but also genuinely happy for her.It meant she had something to strive for, a real career, and that was a good thing. That was why, when she'd asked him to accompany her on stage, he hadn't refused.

Nothing, however, could have prepared him for Hannah's unexpected presence-or for the storm she'd stirred up.

Wearily, Vincent pressed his fingers to his forehead. Lately, he felt he really didn't understand Hannah. As for Victoria? He couldn't care less. Brinley's well-being-that was what mattered. She couldn't afford to go through another spell like this.

Eyes squeezed shut, Brinley tried to control her breathing to keep up her charade, silently counting the seconds. Letting Derek drive her all the way to the ER was out of the question. If doctors started running tests, her lies about the supposed heart condition would unravel right there.

Easing her eyes open, Brinley put on a look of confusion, glancing around as if she had just woken up from a coma. "Vincent? Weren't we just at the event? Why are we driving somewhere?"

Seeing her awake, Vincent's tension visibly eased. "You fainted, so we're on our way to the hospital. Let's hear what the doctors have to say about this."

Brinley sat up quickly, clutching his arm with a soft whimper. "Vincent, could we not go to the hospital? I really dislike it."

Vincent's reply was brisk and emotionless. "We're not skipping it. Hospital, Brinley." He figured that heart condition couldn't be dismissed.

Trying to hide her rising panic, Brinley clung tighter. "Honestly, I'm feeling much better. Lately, I've spent more time in hospitals than anywhere else. I seriously dislike the notion of visiting the hospital."

But Vincent's expression remained stern, his tone brooking no argument. "No changes. Hospital. That's final."

She instantly switched tactics and softened her voice. "Didn't the doctor say my mood matters most?Hospitals depress me. The smell of antiseptic alone ruins it for me. And I hate being at the hospital-it just reminds me I'm a patient who needs to be taken care of."

He stayed unmoved. "We'll only be in the hospital for a short time. This isn't up for debate."

Realizing his stance hadn't shifted an inch, Brinley resorted to her last card. Discreetly pinching her thigh,she made her voice tremble. "Vincent, hospitals bring back every awful memory. My father and my brother both died in places like that.It scares me."

Turning his head, Vincent let his gaze drift to the window. The flicker of emotion in his eyes was impossible to read.

For a heartbeat, Brinley let her voice falter. "If I'd known you'd worry like this, I never would've told you about my heart condition at all. Nobody knows my limits better than I do."

Vincent stayed silent for a while before he finally said, "Fine. Derek, drive us back."

###Chapter 72 Your Wife Ran Off


Brinley curled her lips in satisfaction. She knew it-Vincent would give in eventually. As she replayed the gala in her mind, her fury simmered beneath the surface. The audacity of Hannah, shaming her in public like that,right in front of Vincent, no less!

With careful calculation, Brinley squeezed out a few convincing tears and gave Vincent a wounded look."Vincent, I never meant to keep my being Victoria from you. I just couldn't figure out how to explain it. And at the gala-I had no clue why Hannah came after me like that. The way she went after me... It was humiliating. People jumped to conclusions and whispered things that aren't true. My heart pounded so fast that I just blacked out."

"Don't mind Hannah's antics," Vincent said calmly, idly twisting his wedding ring as he bent his knee.

To him, Hannah's behavior was just another recent outburst. He had dismissed everything she'd said at the gala without a second thought.

Relief washed over Brinley, her spirits rising. The meaning behind Vincent's words was clear-he was taking her side. Her place in Vincent's heart was unshakable, no matter what chaos Hannah created.

Their drive ended ten minutes later at the gates of the Jones family estate.

Eager to move ahead, Brinley stepped from the car first, her ears catching Vincent's quiet conversation with Derek. His instructions were clear-Derek was to go fetch Hannah from Cloudspire Center.

Instantly, Brinley's smile faded. What had Hannah done to deserve special treatment? Before jealousy could take root, she composed herself, plastering on her sweetest smile as Vincent approached.

Inside the entryway, Vincent and Brinley were greeted by Sharon, settled on the living room sofa.

Sharon usually tended to her garden, challenged someone to chess, and took long walks. Thus, her stillness on the sofa was jarring.

A shadow crossed Sharon's face as soon as they appeared. "Why is it just the two of you?"

Tension laced her words, hinting at an obvious disappointment at someone's presence.

Brinley knew Sharon implied she was not welcome. Her lips parted to respond, but Sharon had already fixed Vincent with a glare and jabbed a finger in his direction. "Didn't I tell you to bring your wife home? Where is she? Are you ignoring my words now?"

Nothing ever rattled the powerful CEO ofthe Jones Group-except his grandmother's scolding. With her,Vincent had no choice but to listen in silence.

Dragging a tired hand across his forehead, Vincent let himself slump into the cushions. "Derek's already on his way to pick her up," he muttered.

Sharon jabbed him in the arm. "You little rascal. That's your idea of winning your wife over? That's your wife,and you send your assistant to bring her home?"

Vincent was at a loss for words.

Brinley sat stiffly beside them, listening to the entire conversation revolving around Hannah, as though she didn't exist. She pressed her teeth into her bottom lip, swallowing her frustration, but kept quiet. Sharon's anger was written all over her face. Staying silent was the only safe move.

A sudden ringtone cut through the tension. Vincent glanced at his phone. Derek was calling.

Expecting a report of having fetched Hannah, Vincent put the call on speaker, making sure Sharon could listen in.

Sharon leaned in.

"Derek, put Hannah on the line," Vincent instructed.

On the other end, Derek sounded bewildered. "Mr. Jones, your wife has already left. I didn't see her."

Vincent's face turned cold in an instant. He let out a short, bitter laugh before hanging up.

Sharon's eyes sparkled with a silent "I told you so."

Uncertainty darkened Vincent's features. Hannah had left the gala. She wasn't coming home.Where had she disappeared to?

The tap of Sharon's cane against the floor punctuated her annoyance. "Didn't I warn you? Your wife ran off.And another thing-Hannah is your wife, not some business contact. Why are you hiding behind your assistant instead of speaking to her yourself? Marriage isn't handled by delegation,Vincent."

A storm seemed to pass over Vincent's face. Even phone calls didn't reach Hannah-she'd gone as far as blocking his number.

Sharon let out a weary sigh. "You two were never like this before. What on earth did you do to upset her so badly?"

###Chapter 73 Eight Days Left


A tightness gripped Vincent's throat, so he tried steering the conversation away. "Grandma, maybe it's time for you to rest.Aubrey-"

A sharp glare from Sharon cut him off. "Only call for Aubrey when it's convenient for you, huh? Don't bother.I'm not leaving this spot until my granddaughter-in-law is back in this house."

Listening from the sidelines, Brinley could only seethe as Sharon repeated "your wife" and "my granddaughter-in-law," all pointing at Hannah. The words burned, each one a reminder of what she believed should have belonged to her.

"Hannah won't be coming back," Vincent remarked with a frustrated sigh. "Didn't Derek say he couldn't find her?" A frown creased his face. "She's been running around for days. I have no idea when she'll bother to return."

Sharon fixed him with a pointed look. "That's because she wanted to steer clear of you. I have already rang her up. She promised she'd come back soon," she said, clearly enjoying the upper hand.

A fresh wave of irritation settled over Vincent.

A slow, meaningful smile curved Sharon's lips. "Hannah really cares about me. She actually listens, unlike my grandson, who tunes me out completely."

Vincent felt each word hit home, their sting impossible to shake.

Brinley, sensing the tension, was about to speak-when the door opened. Hannah walked in.

Brinley's shoulders tensed, and her words dried up instantly.

One step into the living room, Hannah paused, surprised by the presence of Vincent and Brinley. She had assumed they wouldn't be here, but since they looked perfectly at ease, she decided not to back down.After all, she wasn't the shameless homewrecker or the unfaithful spouse here.She did nothing wrong to be uneasy about.

A while back, after saying goodbye to Rena post-gala, Hannah had gotten a call from Sharon,asking her to come home, and she hadn't hesitated.

Vincent's eyes barely left Hannah from the moment she crossed the entrance-barely noticeable,but persistent.


Catching his stare from the corner of her eye, Hannah made a point of ignoring him entirely.

"Sharon, I'm home," Hannah called out, her return motivated by a desire to spare Sharon, already in her seventies, from the stress of watching her and Vincent's mnarriage unravel. She had assumed that Vincent and Brinley would be away, but seeing them here didn't bother her in the slightest. There were only eight days left. After that, she and Vincent would have nothing to do with each other.

Tonight, Hannah's focus was on Sharon and nothing else. "How abouta walk, Sharon? Let's get some air,"she suggested warmly.

With a gentle laugh, Sharon waved off the idea."Why rush? Didn't you mention you had planned for my birthday? Now that everyone's gathered, show us what you've got."

Taking charge, Sharon tugged Hannah down beside her, wedging Hannah right between herself and Vincent. Hannah's leg brushed against Vincent's due to the limited space.

Discomfort flashed through Hannah as she shot to her feet, unable to hide the look of distaste thatcrossed her face.

Expression tight and cold, Vincent said nohing, simply staring at her.

His mood was plain to see. Hannah felt it, but didn't let it touch her. No more would she let his moods decide her actions. That included something as simple as sitting within arm's reach.

With a pleasant smile, Hannah excused herself. "I'Il be right back, Sharon. Just need to grab my laptop," she said, already heading for the stairs as she was eager to put some distance between herself and Vincent.

She hurried to her room, heading straight for the desk. The curtains were drawn and the lights were off,casting the room in a dim hush.

Something about the layout seemed to have changed, but she didn't pay it much attention.
###Chapter 74 She's Not An Outsider


Descending the stairs with her laptop, Hannah found Danica already settled in the living room, engaged in friendly conversation with Brinley.

Making no effort to greet them, Hannah slipped quietly onto the sofa beside Sharon and began powering up her computer, ready to present her ideas-only to be interrupted by Vincent. "If I'm not mistaken, Brinley's in charge of this birthday celebration planning."

For a second, Hannah sat frozen, a wave of powerlessness washing over her. Her gaze narrowed on Vincent.He really was determined to deny her even the smallest bit of respect. He understood exactly how much Sharon meant to her.

Danica chimed in, "Exactly. Hannah, you're just helping this year. Don't get your roles mixed up." Linking arms with Brinley, she smiled. "Brinley, you have crafted a plan, right? Why don't you run upstairs and grab your laptop to show it to Sharon?"

With a well-practiced look of embarrassment, Brinley nodded and hurried upstairs.

Bewilderment flickered across Sharon's face as she glanced back and forth between Hannah and Danica."What's going on? Hasn't Hannah always organized my birthday?"

Vincent said nothing, cold eyes occasionally settling on Hannah with an unspoken warning.

Not missing a beat, Danica tried to smooth things over. "Brinley's just returned from overseas and wanted to do something special for you. It's your seventieth birthday, after all. Hannah has planned every celebration until now-surely she won't mind letting someone else take a turn."

A sharp crack in Sharon's voice cut through the room. "Nonsense. Tell me-who is Brinley to us?"

Danica froze, at a loss for words.

With a determined push, Sharon stood, gripping her cane tightly. Her glare never wavered. "Brinley doesn't belong to this family. She's not one of us. But Hannah is my granddaughter-in-law. And you want to put my birthday in the hands of an outsider? What exactly were you thinking?"

Danica had always been a little intimidated by Sharon. Now, she didn't dare say a word.

Hannah lifted her head, emotiontightening her chest as she watched Sharon defend her so fiercely. Deep down, she had always known-no one in tis house truly cared about her except Sharon.

Meanwhile, Brinley was making her way down from the third floor when she caught the tail of Sharon's words. A sharp pang twisted in her chest. That single word, outsider, was alI Sharon had ever seen her as.

Breaking the tension, Vincent spoke up, massaging his temple. "Grandma, Brinley isn't some outsider."

Sharon's fury turned toward him. "Don't even get me started on you, Vincent! You just stood there and let your wife be reduced to an assistant to an outsider? Is this how you treat your own wife?"

Every bit of bitterness and scorn flickered in Hannah's gaze. The answer was obvious to anyone watching-Vincent's heart was with Brinley.

Words of self-defense nevercame from Vincent. He absorbed the criticism, silent and unmoving.

Once Sharon had said her piece, Vincent answered in a low voice, "You're blowing this out of proportion.They each came up with a plan, so you can just take a look at both." He left the decision squarely in Sharon's hands. "Pick whichever you like best. It's upto you."

Danica muttered to herself, "We've already settled that Brinley would take charge."

One cold stare from Sharon silenced her. "Don't forget, none of you even bothered to ask me before deciding my birthday would be run by someone outside the family. Still want to argue? Then go ahead with the celebration without me."

That was enough to keep Danica quiet.

Every fresh defeat for Danica brought a trace of laughter to Hannah's lips. A turn of her head put her face-to-face with Vincent. Whatever amusement she felt evaporated, replaced by a wry,dismissive smile.

Vincent caught every nuance. His gaze grew colder, sharper than ever.

At this point, Brinley glided back downstairs, laptop in hand, pretending to have missed all the tension. She wedged herself between Sharon and Vincent with practiced ease.

Rising almost instantly, Vincent stepped aside. "I'll let you all talk."

Brinley and Hannah each presented their own plan for the birthday celebration. Sharon listened closely,questions sharp and probing, like a CEO testing her board.
 
Responses came readily. Brinley's answers were polished, but Hannah's were thoughtful and exacting.

When it came time to choose, Sharon made her preference clear. Hannah's proposal won, hands down.

###Chapter 75 The Room For Their Future Life


"I'm leaning toward Hannah's proposal." Sharon reached over and gave Hannah's hand a gentle pat. "Thank you for your effort."

A bright smile lit up Hannah's face. "I'm really glad you like it, Sharon."

Hannah pulled Sharon into a warm hug, even nestling her face against Sharon's shoulder.

Anyone watching would have found the moment truly touching.

Vincent looked on, feeling a stab of unease. That kind of smile from Hannah hadn't been directed at him for a very long time.

When Sharon was in the room, Danica never had a say. Instead, she placed a comforting hand on Brinley's shoulder.She figured that once Hannah wrapped up the divorce procedure and left the Jones family behind,Brinley would have plenty of opportunities to shine. For now, it didn't hurt to let Hannah enjoy her victory,just one birthday celebration.

Danica felt no concern at all.

The sting of disappointment settled in Brinley's chest, her nails pressing hard into her palms. "Sharon, why did you choose Hannah's plan over mine? I spent four days working on my own plan. How could you dismiss my plan as less thoughtful?"

Tears crept into Brinley's words. "You've watched me grow up. I have viewed you as my grandmother. I just wanted to do something that would bring you happiness, but you make me feel like I don't belong, like I'm just some outsider." Her tone was filled with hurt.

A mocking smile played at the corners of Hannah's mouth. The divorce wasn't even final, yet Brinley already pictured herself as a true member of the Jones family.

Brinley's emotional plea didn't move Sharon at all. Sharon's expression stayed stern and composed. "But you are indeed an outsider. At best, you're the child of a late friend. Since you left for overseas, we've hardly been in contact, and that's the full extent of our relationship. You don't need to, and you don't have the right to plan my birthday celebration."

Pausing to let her words sink in, she added, "Also, there are only eight days until my birthday party. Many of Hannah's arrangements are already set in motion, while your ideas are still in the early stages. You suggested a lawn party, but the venue needs to be booked a month ahead. Clearly, you haven't followed up with your proposal. In every way, Hannah's plan is more suitable."

Speechless, Brinley could only look toward Vincent for help. Her voice cracked. "Vincent, I really did put my heart into this..."

Vincent's jaw tightened as he spoke."My grandma has the final say."

A heavy silence settled over the room.

Biting her lip, Brinley muttered, "You're all against me because my father and brother are gone,"then hurried upstairs in tears.

Her outburst left the rest of the group exchanging uneasy looks.

Danica leaned closer to Vincent and gave him a nudge. "Vincent, shouldn't you go after Brinley? She might need someone right now."

Vincent shot a sharp look in Hannah's direction, his eyes sending a silent warning.

Hannah understood immediately. Vincent blamed her for having Sharon's support, making his first love upset.What a twisted logic. Bitterness flickered at the corners of her mouth.

Vincent was just about to walk toward the stairs when Sharon stopped him with a raised hand. "Stay here.The one you should be accompanying now is your wife," she said sternly.

The thought of Vincent's company made Hannah's skin prickle. She wanted no part of it.

A chill crept into Vincent's reply. "Grandma, Brinley's not well. She fainted just earlier, and being scolded in front of everyone probably made her upset. I have to go check on her."

A wave of exhaustion washed over Hannah. Brinley's heart condition seemed to give her power over Vincent.


Hannah's heart had been numb for so long that she couldn't feel the pain anymore. Fortunately, she was about to divorce Vincent, and this wouldn't last much longer.

Sharon made another attempt to stop Vincent, but Hannah reached out and gently squeezed Sharon's

hand. "It's aIright, Sharon. Let him go."

Vincent made his way upstairs.

Trailing close behind, Danica wore a satisfied smirk. The truth was plain-Vincent's concern belonged to Brinley. Not even Sharon's support would keep Hannah from being kicked out once the birthday party ended.
After soothing Sharon, Hannah made her way back up to her room on the second floor. The moment she stepped inside, she sensed something was wrong.

Nothing looked the same anymore. The crib that once sat in the corner had vanished without a trace.

She glanced around and saw that her dried flowerframe was no longer on the vanity table. Even the bed that Vincent had specially brought had been replaced by something new.

Instead of the calm, simple décor she loved, the whole space now felt extravagant and overly feminine.Gone were the mist-blue curtains she and Vincent had chosen together, replaced now with a glaring shade of pink.

Everything,from the wardrobe to the sofa to the makeup table, had been swapped out for something else.

Tears stung Hannah's eyes. One single day away, and Vincent hadn't wasted any time making the room unrecognizable, erasing the life they had built together. It made sense now why he was out shopping for wedding dresses with Brinley. He had already redecorated the room for his future life with Brinley.

The bitterness in Hannah's eyes grew sharper. For someone like Vincent, she had been nothing more than a temporary stand-in, explaining his lack of hesitation in shattering the rare, shared sweetness from their past.

But it didn't matter. Since he had already transformed the room holding the precious memories, she refused to hang onto it.

After a few paces, she turned around and hurried toward the bed. Her suspicion was confirmed-the diary she'd hidden was nowhere to be found. That diary, which held the whole story of how she met Vincent,how she fell in love, and eventually married him, had vanished.

At first, she'd kept it at the house in Lakeshore Villa. But once Brinley had paid a visit there, Hannah had moved it to the Jones family estate instead. It was supposed to be a keepsake, but it was lost in the end.Maybe it was better this way. She had already made up her mind to get a divorce from Vincent. No point dwelling on it.

Hannah slung her bag over her shoulder, walked to the door, and reached for the handle.

As soon as she pulled the door open, Vincent appeared right in front of her,about to enter.

He gave her one look, clearly displeased to find her ready to leave. "It's late," he said coldly. "Where are you planning to go?"

###Chapter 76 Just Right For Your Next Wedding Night


Catching sight of Vincent blocking the doorway, Hannah's expression immediately hardened. "That's not your concern." With a determined push, she brushed past him, making a beeline for the hallway.

A storm brewed in Vincent's eyes as he caught her bythe arm and dragged her back, the door thudding shut behind them. His sleeve rolled up, he shot her a pointed look. "You're not leaving," he ordered, voice crisp and unyielding.

Hannah fixed him with a frosty stare. She paused for a moment before letting out a sharp scoff. "Was it really necessary for you to be this heartless?"

She smirked. What did he expect-was he seriously going to force her to stay in this room and witness his happiness with Brinley? She was hardly interested in watching.

Anger flared inside Hannah, each breath coming sharper than the last.

A crease appeared between Vincent's brows as he studied her, frustration clear. Recently, he found himself at a loss every time they spoke. Danica's presence upstairs with Brinley was the only reason he'd cut his visit short-only to catch Hannah about to slip away. And on top of that, Hannah's icy tone stung. She wasn't like this before.

Frustration made his tone harsh. "You already have full control over the birthday celebration planning. What more do you want?"

"Sharon gave me that responsibility. What does that have to do with you?" Hannah retorted. Brinley was the only one Vincent ever seemed willing to defend.

Eyes shining with biting sarcasm, Hannah raised her chin, refusing to back down. "Get out of my way."

Vincent's tone sank lower, rough and tight, like every word had to be forced past his jaw. "I am not moving.Say it. What the hell's been going on with you these days?"

Hannah had to suppress an eye roll. Unbelievable. Now he wanted answers, after everything he'd put her through? No reply came. Wasting breath on him felt pointless, every second in this room pressing down on her. All she wanted was to escape.

Hannah didn't flinch. She lifted a hand and motioned toward the freshly redone bedroom behind her, her tone dripping with biting sarcasm. "From whereI'm standing, it looks like you're the eager one to walk away from this marriage."

Folding her arms, she let her voice shift to something cold and detached., for you to remarry soon,I'd recommend setting aside time to wrap up our divorce."

The words landed hard, each one stinging like a slap. Vincent's jaw tightened, a pulse hammering at his temple, and his breath started to come in heavy bursts.

She could tell he was seething. It didn't matter. She turned her head away and stared at the wall.

Then came his voice again, quiet but sharpwith strain. "Hannah, do you really want a divorce that badly?"

###Chapter 77 | Am Not Divorcing You


Vincent's voice came through, filled with a quiet sincerity.

When Hannah glanced up, she caught sight of a storm of emotions swirling in his eyes. A trace of reluctance lingered there, almost hidden, but she noticed. That could not be right, could it?

Shaking her head, Hannah pushed the thought away. Why would Vincent hesitate to end things with her now? With Brinley's return, their marriage had a clear expiration date. The only reason he hadn't broached the subject yet was because of his grandmother.

Matching his seriousness, Hannah remarked, "Vincent, let's not even mention those three years we dated.Just focus on the five years we've been married. Can you recall a single moment where we were truly happy together?"

Vincent responded, "I can." He believed their days had passed by smoothly, free of real arguments, and that calmness equaled happiness.

Yet,Hannah gave a bitter laugh, her lips curling into a half-smile. "That's not true for me. Through these five years, I can't recall any happiness. If anything, marrying you has brought me nothing but heartache."

Shock flickered in Vincent's eyes, and all color drained from his face. He opened his mouth to speak, his throat working, but no words came out. So, that was how Hannah saw their years together?

Hannah's gaze fell to her lap as she reflected. Five years felt like a lifetime. She'd been called a home wrecker and even scorned by those in high society while she was actually Vincent's rightful wife. Danica had never hidden her contempt, and Vincent had rarely come home to care. For ages, she'd barely dared to leave their house. The latest blow had been her parents' worry about her marriage.

She realized that each heartbreak and every bit of loneliness-all because she became Vincent's wife. If they had married for love, it might have been bearable, but the truth was, this marriage lacked love entirely.Vincent's heart was never hers. She had always just filled a vacancy.

If she had never chased after him all those years ago, maybe she could have spared herself all this pain.Regret pressed heavily on her heart. If only she'd never crossed paths with Vincent, perhaps her world would be less complicated.

"I'm not divorcing you." Only after a long pause did those words finally break free, the strain obvious in his tone.

Rolling her eyes, Hannah didn't take his statement seriously. Of course, he would marry Brinley someday.The divorce was inevitable.

Nothing in Hannah's expression betrayed any feeling. "Move out of my way."

"Where do you think you're headed?" Vincent's brow creased as he watched her.

Hannah found it amusing that he'd asked her the same question twice, as if on purpose.

"I don't know what you expect from me, Vincent," Hannah replied, unable to hide her irritation."Doyou really want me to sleep in a bed you saved for your future life with Brinley?"

"You're not leaving this room. This is where you'll sleep," Vincent insisted, refusing to budge.

"That's ridiculous. There's no chance I'm staying in here," Hannah retorted, her anger bubbling over.

In a flash, she raised her knee, feigning a kick, but Vincent stepped aside with ease.

Seizing her chance, she slipped through the open door. Being in the same room with Vincent made the air suffocating. With her back to him, she said, "Starting today, I'll sleep in the guest room."

She resolved that after his grandmother's birthday, she wouldn't return to this place.

Without waiting for a response, she marched across the hall, pushed open the guest room door, and shut it behind her without looking back.

Vincent, left standing alone, leaned heavily against the door, his throat burning. He'd given up cigarettes when they started trying for a baby. But now, irritation gnawed at him. He found himself reaching for a cigarette from the drawer, lighting it with trembling hands.

Smoke quickly filled the room, making it impossible to read the turmoil in Vincent's eyes.

Upstáirs, Danica caught the sounds drifting up from below and couldn't resist spying from the stairwell.Upon discovering that Hannah and Vincent would be spending the night in separate rooms, she couldn't have been happier.

Within moments, Danica rushed off, eager to share the good news with Brinley.
###Chapter 78 Probably Out Seeing Other Men


For Danica, losing ten properties was a blow she couldn't forget. A storm of frustration churned within her,and every time Hannah's name popped into her mind, her hands started to shake. No one would have been surprised by how much she wanted to lash out.

Thus, Danica had targeted the second-floor bedroom, the very room Hannah had poured her heart into decorating. Everyone in the family knew Hannah's one request: the arrangement in that room was to remain untouched.

Danica had been set on getting back at Hannah, no matter how petty it seemed.

Each tear or frown from Hannah only fueled Danica's sense of victory.

Meanwhile, Brinley, who had quietly listened to Danica's words, began to feel a bit lighter. The sadness that clung to her after Vincent's hasty exit finally faded. "Mrs. Jones, I'm grateful for your support," she whispered, her voice soft as silk.

"Oh, you don't need to thank me for anything," Danica replied, a warm smile spreading across her face."I went ahead and redid that bedroom to your taste. You'll absolutely adore it. It's just right for you and Vincent once you're married."

A shy smile played on Brinley's lips, but shadows passed through her eyes as she remembered every incident-from the gala's chaos to the tense moments at the Jones family estate.

···

Sleep had barely touched Vincent last night. Dawn found him wandering downstairs, only to discover Sharon and Danica already gathered around the breakfast table.

Puling out a chair, Vincent sat down and sent a glance toward Aubrey."Where's Hannah?" he asked, almost as an afterthought.

Aubrey answered promptly, "She left before sunrise."

Without missing a beat, Danica chimed in, "I have no clue what keeps Hannah so busy lately. It's like she's never home anymore."

Sharon shot her a look. "If Hannah is out, then she clearly has her reasons. Instead of gossiping, why don't you find something useful to do around here?"

Danica muttered to herself, "She's a housewife, not a businesswoman. What could she possibly be so busy with? She's probably out seeing other men."

Both Vincent and Sharon picked up every word, despite Danica's low voice.

Sharon slammed her spoon onto the table with a loud clatter. "If you keep spouting nonsense at breakfast,you can eat somewhere else. From now on, we'll eat in separate roomns."

Danica fell silent.

Across the table, Vincent showed nothing. He nursed his coffee, adjusted his jacket, and then strode out without a backward glance.

Outside, Derek waited near the curb, checking his watch.

Not a second passed after Vincent slid into the back seat before Derek took note of his haggard appearance. "You didn't get a wink of sleep, did you,Mr.Jones?"

A faint crease formed between Vincent's brows, and he gave a low grunt in response.

"Mr. Jones, no matter how packed your schedule is, you can't neglect your health. Your grandmother's holding onto hope that you'll start a family soon."

Vincent shot Derek a look, calm but chilling.

In an instant, Derek decided it was better not to say another word.

The drive went on in silence until Vincent broke it, gaze still fixed on the passing scenery. "I'll send you a layout sketch later. Purchase the materials exactly as specified-color, dimensions, style. Everything has to match. I want my bedroom on the second floor redone to those exact specifications."

"Understood," Derek replied, his tone brisk and unquestioning.

Arriving at the office, Vincent was immediately met by Clive's eager announcement. "Mr. Jones, Miss Gilbert's been waiting in your office for a while."

Trailing after Vincent, Clive added, "Oh, and here is the custom ring you ordered."
Vincent took the dainty band, holding it up against his own ring finger. "This is too loose by a millimeter.I specified sixteen, not seventeen. Redo it."

Panic flickered in Clive's eyes. At that time, he had let his excitement get ahead of him and asked Brinley for the size instead, assuming it would be close enough. Never had he thought Vincent would catch such a tiny difference.

Vincent didn't give him another glance. When he entered his office, Brinley stepped forward to greet him.He cut straight to the point."Why are you here?"
###Chapter 79 Acquired Nova Tech


A thick folder labeled "Nova Tech Acquisition Plan" landed on the table as Brinley set it before Vincent.

Vincent met her eyes, curiosity piqued. "You want to acquire this company?"

"That's right." Without hesitation, Brinley shared her reasoning. "Nova Tech and Polaris Tech have always been rivals, but Nova's product line is far more developed. If we move fast and bring their assets under our umbrella, it gives Polaris Tech a real edge and could help us lock in future deals with VitraMind. Moreover,Nova Tech recently declared bankruptcy, presenting a timely opportunity for acquisition."

Still feeling the sting from Hannah's public humiliation at the gala, Brinley was eager to prove her capabilities and solidify her persona as "Victoria" to silence the doubters for good.

Acquiring another company and taking over their products was the quickest way Brinley could think of.It wasn't just about their products.Nova Tech had once hit the big time. Acquiring it meant she could parade its past success as her own achievement.

There was one snag-Brinley didn't have enough funds to make the acquisition, which was why she brought her pitch to Vincent.

A hint of anxiety crept into Brinley's voice. "Vincent, what do you think?"

Vincent considered her proposal, eyebrows lifted in mild surprise. "That's a bold plan."

He spent a moment leafing through the acquisition documents before finally responding,"It's worth a try."Excitement lit up Brinley's face.


···

A sleepless night weighed heavily on Hannah, who reached Nova Tech before anyone else.

Yesterday's encounter with Miles at the gala had only fueled her determination to prove what Nova Tech could really do. The priority was to produce the hormone detection wristband after wrapping up its design.

Rena revealed that in a few days, there would be an open bidding opportunity for VitraMind. If Miles took a liking to their product, securing a partnership would be a sure thing.
Felix noticed the dark circles beneath Hannah's eyes, along with her relentless energy as she dove straight into work.

When lunchtime rolled around, fretting she might skip the meal altogether, Felix dragged her to his office to dine together. Yet, even throughout the meal, she kept the conversation focused on product features and improvements.

Felix's office had a small lounge with a bed meant for resting. Worried about her burning out, he suggested,"After lunch, you should lie down and recharge-it's lunch break, after all."

Hannah said, "I'm not tired. I want to update the wristband's algorithm after the meal." But after only a few bites, she set her fork down, her appetite lost.

When she tried to slip out of his office, he gently nudged her toward the lounge.

"Just rest a bit, okay?" With a wry smile, Felix joked, "I need you in one piece for the launch of our new product."

A soft laugh escaped Hannah."I'm tougher than I look."

Felix shook his head. "That's not true."

He still remembered that back when Hannah hadn't married and was still hidden behind the alias"Victoria,"she had fallen ill after facing online backlash for her initiatives as "Victoria." Her old college roommates had shared that detail with him during one of his visits to her campus.

Hearing the genuine concern in his voice, Hannah felt her cheeks warm with embarrassment. She didn't resist and straightforwardly said, "Alright. I'll rest for a while. Just wake me up when it's time to get back to work."

With a nod, Felix eased the door shut behind him.

At his desk, he found himself distracted by thoughts of her resting just a few steps away. Something about sharing this space with her felt different, more meaningful-maybe it because she held a special place in his heart.

Time slipped by. By the time the clock hit three, Felix still hadn't stirred Hannah from her nap. He secretly hoped she'd sleep even longer, knowing how much she needed some rest.

Out of nowhere, the receptionist rushed in. "Mr. Wade, someone from Polaris Tech wants to meet with you!"
Felix quickly put a finger to his lips. "Quiet, please." Leaning in, he whispered urgently, "Polaris Tech? Tell them I'm not available. I don't know who they are."

Just then, a voice spoke up from behind the receptionist. "You must be Mr. Wade."

Three visitors entered-two men flanking a poised woman.

Brinley, linking arms with Vincent, offered a bright smile. "We're here to discuss a potential partnership, Mr.Wade."

Clive stepped forward and extended the business proposal.

Felix, however, didn't reach for it, instead locking eyes with Vincent in silent acknowledgment.

Feeling the tension, Clive awkwardly withdrew the proposal.

A cool,assessing glance came from Vincent. "Your operation here is on the small side."

Unfazed, Felix responded evenly, "Naturally, our company can't compare to yours, Mr. Jones."

A flicker of surprise crossed Brinley's face-did these two know each other?
###Chapter 80 Sleep In Another Man's Office


Across the table, Brinley noticed the quiet standoff between the two men. Her urge to speak was strong, but she kept her questions to herself, wondering why Felix's face stirred up a sense of familiarity. Even so, none of that could distract her from what really mattered-the acquisition was the only thing on her mind.

Wasting no time, Brinley leaned forward. "Mr. Wade, reports have surfaced about your company heading for bankruptcy. That's why we're here to talk about acquiring it."

Taking charge, Vincent casually settled into the seat behind Felix's desk, giving off an air of authority."Name your price."

A small laugh escaped Felix. "Mr. Jones, Nova Tech isn't exactly a bargain."

Instead of responding, Vincent stretched out a hand. Clive, quick on the uptake, placed a folder in his palm.The proposal slid across the desk toward Felix as Vincent's tone cut through the room. "Our analysts have assessed your business. At best, it comes to five million."

With an extra dose of pride, Vincent added, "We're willing to pay five million to take Nova Tech off your hands." He fixed his eyes on Felix, clearly expecting the man to surrender.

Felix's answer was nothing but a cool grin. "Five million? Hard to pass up, I'll admit."

Seeing an opening, Brinley brightened. "Exactly, Mr. Wade. The money could be wired to you before the day ends. On top of that, I can assure you that every employee at Nova Tech would be welcomed at Polaris Tech, yourself included. We'd even love for you to join us as vice chairman."

Though Felix's expression never wavered, his voice grew firm. "It's a generous offer from both of you,but..."His eyes narrowed slightly. "I won't be selling Nova Tech. All debts are settled. There's no bankruptcy happening here."

Offering a cordial smile laced with subtle dismissal, Felix remarked, "Regardless, I do thank you for your concern."

That response sent Brinley reeling. Her subsequent moves hinged on acquiring Nova Tech. Doing her best to hide her disappointment, she composed herself and pressed on. "Is it a matter of numbers, Mr. Wade?Polaris Tech, with the full backing of the Jones Group, can easily increase the offer. Money isn't an obstacle
for us."

Vincent's eyes flickered as he glanced up at her briefly, though he stayed silent.

Meeting Vincent's look without wavering, Felix replied, "This isn't a question of finances. Nova Tech was founded through a partnership with someone I hold in the highest regard. Selling isn't an option. I'm not the person you should be negotiating with. I think it's time you left."

Refusing to concede defeat, Brinley made one last attempt. The stakes were too high for her to walk away now. "Mr. Wade, if there are any terms or requirements you'd like us to consider, just say the word.We're ready to accommodate you however we can." She positioned herself at the edge of the desk near Vincent,her tone unwavering and earnest.

But Felix remained unmoved. "I have to refuse. As I mentioned before, Nova Tech isn't up for sale."

Finally, Briney's professional facade slipped for a split second. She hadn't anticipated such stubborn resistance, and it dawned on her that a direct approach to the other partner might have been wiser. Despite her displeasure, she held her composure. "Nova Tech hasn't turned a profit in years. It's a struggle to keep the business afloat. Aligning with the Jones Group is your surest path to a stable future. Please reconsider,Mr.Wade."

Vincent rose from his seat with the commanding air, his expression cold and composed. "You have three days to think this through."

Without another word, he turned, heading to the door of the room.

But Brinley remained planted, unwilling to accept defeat so soon. With negotiations already underway,she sensed that a little extra push might tip the scales. After all, who would turn their back on that much money?Certainly not a business barely scraping together a million in annual revenue. It seemed impossible to her that Felix could turn his nose up at a five-million-dollar payout.

Felix, already losing patience, spoke up before she did."My answer stands. There's nothing more to reconsider."

Just then, a faint creak broke the tension-a sound coming from the lounge.

A door edged open. Hannah appeared in the doorway, her steps slow, eyes still foggy with sleep."Reconsider what?" Her question came out soft and unhurried, carrying the languor of someone who'd just left a sun-warmed bed.

Recognition flickered across Vincent's face at the sound of her voice. Instantly, he stopped in his tracks and pivoted. His wife was in another man's office. The haze of a recent nap still lingered around her.

A thundercloud passed over Vincent's features, his expression shifting in an instant.

###Chapter 81 My Woman


Spotting Vincent and Brinley just a few steps away, Hannah snapped to full alert. Any trace of drowsiness vanished, even though her brain was still catching up.

Clive's jaw threatened to drop in shock. His boss's kept woman was in another man's office? He couldn't wrap his head around it. So, Hannah hadn't been dumped yet?She must have more cunning than he'd given her credit for. Scorn twisted in his mind.

Even Brinley couldn't hide her astonishment at Hannah's appearance. In that instant, it dawned on her why Felix's face had seemed so familiar. Her memory brought back the image of him sitting with Hannah at Chance Cafe. Clearly, their connection ran deeper than she'd realized. But what was really going on between them?

Instinct drew Brinley's attention to Vincent. His face made everything clear-he was seething. His glare at Hannah could have frozen stone.

Brinley immediately understood. Vincent's ego was wounded.

No one dared to break the suffocating silence that filled the room.

With a relaxed smile, Felix closed the distance between him and Hannah."Did we wake you up? Why not sleep a bit longer?" he said softly.

Checking the time on her phone, Hannah realized it was almost four o'clock. "Why didn't you wake me?"

A gentle grin lingered on Felix's face. "I figured you deserved a little more sleep."

She regarded Vincent and Brinley with a cool stare and asked, "They're here for Nova Tech?"

Felix kept his gaze steady on her. "That's right. They're here hoping to buy the company."

Any warmth vanished from Hannah's features as the reality hit. So Vincent was aiming for Nova Tech now?

Tension sliced through Vincent's voice as he spoke, lips pressed into a thin line. "Come over here. Now."Every word landed like a slap of winter air.

Not a single step did Hannah take. She simply gave him a look.

A hard knot formed in Vincent's chest. Damn it. His mother had been right all along. Hannah had rushed out early this morning just to meet this guy. On top of everything, she'd actually sleep in this guy's office.

A bitter laugh burst from Vincent as he crossed the space between them in quick, forceful steps. His hand seized Hannah's wrist, attempting to yank her away.

"Let go of me!" Hannah exclaimed, twisting against him, but his grip refused to loosen. Angry red marks sprang up on her skin almost immediately.

Without missing a beat, Felix moved in, securing Hannah's other arm. His eyes narrowed with challenge."Mr. Jones, care to explain exactly what you're doing right now?"

Vincent's gaze grew icier as he let out a short, mocking laugh. "Why would I owe you any sort of explanation?"

Not backing down, Felix's tone grew firmer. "Dragging my woman out of here absolutely demands an explanation."

Hushed silence blanketed the office. All attention focused on Felix.

Brinley's eyes widened in shock. Felix had feelings for Hannah? If that was the case, their negotiation just got a whole lot trickier. No acquisition would go smoothly with feelings tangled up like this. There was no telling what influence Hannah might wield over Felix.

The way Felix immediately came to Hannah's defense filled Brinley with scorn. Hannah was really something else-after falling out with Vincent, she wasted no time jumping into another man's armns. Yet, did Felix understand he might be nothing more than Hannah's consolation prize?

Eyes slanting in calculation, Brinley spoke up, her voice smooth. "Vincent, don't be upset. I'm sure there's been some kind of misunderstanding."

Vincent ignored Brinley's words altogether. A frosty chuckle slipped from him as he tightened his jaw. "You said your woman?"

In a gentle but steady tone, Hannah addressed Felix, "Let go,please."

Hannah understood Felix's intention at once-he actually meant business partner, but to keep her role at Nova Tech under wraps and ease her out of the confrontation, he opted for the words "his woman" instead.She didn't doubt his intentions. His support meant a lot. Even so, she had no wish to drag him into the fallout between herself and Vincent.

After a moment's hesitation, Felix released Hannah's wrist.

Hannah's steady gaze met Vincent's thunderous glare. She had no intention of causing a scene here, so her words came gently. "If you want to talk, we can do it back at home."

An edge crept into Vincent's voice as he insisted, grip tightening. "Then come home with me now."

Hannah's voice was quiet, but her resolve didn't waver. "Vincent, my life is my own. I decide where I go. And right now, I have other priorities-I'm not leaving."

A dangerous light flickered in Vincent's eyes. "Priorities? Is that your way of saying you're off flirting with another man behind my back?"
###Chapter 82 Don't Force Her


Hannah was stunned. Vincent always knew how to break her heart. A handful of careless words from him had managed to sweep aside everything she'd put into the relationship, all those years of loyalty and honest effort. By now, though, her heart had grown numb enough not to let the pain sink in.

A slight smile touched Hannah's lips as she faced Vincent. "I guess I'm not as occupied as you are. You seem to need Miss Gilbert by your side at every turn."

Vincent's answer came in that calm, low voice of his. "Brinley and I are just working."

At Vincent's response, Brinley quickly chimed in, "Hannah, please don't read too much into it. I wanted to acquire Nova Tech since Polaris Tech really needs a solid force like Nova Tech. Vincent worried I might be in over my head, so he accompanied me to discuss the acquisition with Mr. Wade."

Brinley managed to praise Felix's company while also slipping in a little bragging for Hannah's ears. She aimed to make sure Hannah noticed just how much effort Vincent was willing to put in for her, even if it meant going out of his way to help with business.

There was no confusion on Hannah's part. She understood exactly what Brinley was getting at. It could not be clearer to her just how much Vincent valued Brinley, even if no one spelled it out. At this point, she didn't care anymore.

Hannah held her head high and said to Vincent, "Felix and I are just working."

She studied Vincent's face, noticing a quick flash of skepticism in his eyes.

"What sort of work keeps you by his side and even sleeps in his office?" Vincent's glare was sharp and full of fury, and every word seemed to dig painfully into Hannah's chest.

Every word from Vincent was meant to wound, belittling Hannah while slandering Felix.

The insult hit hard, filling Hannah with a sudden, sharp anger. She lifted her hand and landed a slap across Vincent's face.

A sharp crack echoed in the room, and everyone present froze in shock.

"Vincent, are you alright?" Brinley hurried over. Her tone was sharp as she yelled at Hannah, "That was too  much.How could you treat Vincent like that?"

Clive, standing nearby, began to show signs of nervousness. No one had ever laid a finger on Vincent before. There was no denying Hannah's boldness.

With a face set in stone, Hannah stared back and said, "Why shouldn't I slap him? He's the one who went too far. And what position do you have to lecture me?"

Brinley found herself at a loss for words, clearly wanting to keep Hannah's marital connection to Vincent under wraps, especially since Clive was around. Still, she tried to defend Vincent anyway. "It isn't right to hit someone. Look, his cheek is red."

Worried, she added, "Vincent, let go of her hand so I can see how bad it is."

Vincent refused to let go, his grip steady and unmoving. Anger tightened his jaw, and he kept his dark eyes locked on Hannah.

Felix moved to intervene, but Hannah raised her hand, stopping him in his tracks. A sharp laugh escaped her."So what? Miss Gilbert, aren't you here to look after him?"

For a moment, Brinley hesitated, hovering close to Vincent. "Vincent, you should put some ice on your face.Let's leave now."

Yet, Vincent paid her no heed, his focus on Hannah unbroken. "You're coming back with me. Right now."

He acted as if the slap hadn't happened, stubbornly insisting on taking Hannah back, gripping her wrist even tighter.

"I'm not going back with you now." Defiance shone in Hannah's eyes as she tried to wriggle free of his grasp. "Let go." She had long decided that her own feelings would come first.

Neither one seemed ready to back down.

Stepping in again, Felix addressed Vincent, "Mr. Jones, Hannah has made it clear that she isn't going anywhere with you. Please don't force her."

A cold laugh slipped from Vincent's lips. "You call this forcing her?" He let go of Hannah's wrist at last.

Hannah released a sigh of relief and rubbed her wrist, convinced Vincent had finally changed his mind and was about to leave with Brinley.
But the next second, Vincent unexpectedly scooped her up and threw her over his shoulder. The sharp edge of his collarbone pressed against her stomach while he carried her away as if she weighed nothing at all.
###Chapter 83 Carried Her Away


"Vincent, have you lost your mind? Put me down now!" Hannah flailed wildly, fists pounding against Vincent's back.

But to Vincent, the blows barely made a difference. "I won't."

Vincent's face was expressionless as he cast a cool glance at Felix and then carried Hannah out of the office and straight down the corridor, without letting go for a second, not even in the elevator.

Curious whispers started to fill the air as Nova Tech's employees tried to figure out what kind of chaos had just erupted in Felix's office. Their curiosity only grew when they spotted Felix marching after the duo.

All the way to the parking garage, Hannah kept struggling, and one of her heels slipped off along the way.When they reached the car, Vincent opened the passenger door with a single motion and shoved her into the seat.

Her knee hit the gearshift hard. Before she could even make sense of it, the central locking clicked into place.

She made a desperate grab for the window switch, but Vincent was faster. He caught her by the shoulders and pressed her back into the seat.

"Sit still." With his hand firm against her lower back, his gaze was sharp and unyielding.

Right then, Brinley and the rest of the group came downstairs and spotted Vincent bent over Hannah.From a distance, the scene looked too intimate.

Brinley managed a tight smile as she stepped forward. "Vincent, are we heading back now?"

He turned just enough and answered,"Yes."

"I'll ride with you then." Brinley moved to open the back door, but Vincent blocked her path. He lowered his voice and said, "Clive will drive you back to the office."

Still reeling from everything that had just happened, Clive quickly straightened up and replied, "Alright."

Brinley stood frozen in place,stunned.
Without sparing her another glance, Vincent walked around the car, climbed into the driver's seat, and pulled the door shut.

That was when Felix finally spotted Hannah in the passenger seat and started toward her, ready to check on her.Before he could even get close, Vincent pulled away and the car sped out of sight.

Felix remained rooted in place, his hands trembling just a little.

A wave of resentment toward Hannah flared in Brinley's chest as she pressed her lips together. Once again,Hannah had wrecked her plans. And Vincent-no matter how angry he might be-he should've prioritized her.

Trying to mask her irritation, Brinley turned to Felix. With a practiced motion, she held out a business card."If you ever change your mind, Mr. Wade, you can always get in touch with me."

Felix snapped back to reality and didn't take her business card. His voice was cool. "That won't be necessary."

Brinley awkwardly withdrew her hand, silently cursing how impossible it was to sway this man. His firm tone made it obvious that acquiring Nova Tech was off the table. She'd have to rethink her strategy.

After a moment's thought, she offered him a warning, her smile forced. "Mr. Wade, just be careful. Don't let Hannah pull the wool over your eyes."

Felix turned, and a sharp edge crept into his voice. "What are you trying to get at?"

Feigning concern, Brinley softened her voice. "Honestly, I'm just looking out for you. Hannah's been awfully close with Mr. Jones, and now she's tangled up with you. I'd just hate to see you used."

In Brinley's mind, it was clear. Hannah was hedging her bets, getting close to Felix even before her divorce was settled.Letting Hannah succeed wasn't an option.

Felix didn't react the way Brinley had expected. Instead, he gave a dry, almost amused laugh. "You're overthinking it." If only Hannah had hidden feelings for him, that would've been a good thing. But she didn't.Not even close.

Unwilling to let it go, Brinley added, "I simply don't want you to be fooled."

"Spare me your tricks," Felix said, his voice ice cold. "Jumping to conclusions about people you barely know only tells me what kind of person you are. I'm relieved I won't be doing business with someone like you."
Stunned, Brinley stood in silence, her nails digging sharply into her palms.

"Have a good day," Felix remarked, his voice dry and distant. He turned around and walked away, not sparing her so much as a backward glance.
###Chapter 84 A Surprise Proposal To Brinley


Clive quietly slipped away to arrange for a company car. When the vehicle arrived, Brinley climbed in, her mood sour and written all over her face.

Settling into the front seat, Clive couldn't help but notice Brinley's frustration, so he started thinking of ways to lift her spirits. He suddenly thought of the ring he had shown Vincent earlier in the day. He should have kept it a secret from Brinley, but today felt different, and he figured it might just cheer her up.

Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out the small box with enthusiasm."Miss Gilbert, would you like to see something special?"

Ever since Brinley had taken over Polaris Tech, everyone at the Jones Group went out of their way to please her.

A touch of curiosity entered Brinley's voice. "What do you have there?"

She accepted the square box from Clive's hand, her fingers lingering on the lid. When she opened it, a set of matching rings greeted her eyes.

Delight sparked in Brinley's expression, and she gasped, "Are these... Did Vincent have these made?"

Clive nodded, eager to please. "Who else would have prepared them except Mr. Jones?"

"Oh my!" Brinley hadn't expected Vincent to have the rings ready so soon. She was truly surprised.

"Take a look up close, Miss Gilbert. The craftsmanship of the rings is remarkable."

Brinley lifted the woman's ring and studied it with bright, admiring eyes. She couldn't help but slip the ring onto her left hand. It slid on easily and looked absolutely stunning. Her excitement got the better of her, and she pulled out her phone to snap a few photos.

As Clive watched her admire the ring, a question popped into his head. The fit was so perfect on Brinley's finger. Why did Vincent insist on resizig it by just a single millimeter? He quickly shrugged it off, deciding Vincent must have his reasons.

A little nervously, Clive leaned in."Miss Gilbert, if Mr. Jones does propose, please pretend I never showed you the ring. If he hears I spoiled the surprise, he'll never forgive me."
A small smile tugged at Brinley's lips, and her eyes lit up with amusement as she took off the ring and handed the ring box back to him. "You don't have to worry. I'Il act like I never laid eyes on those rings."

She found herself already picturing the moment Vincent might get down on one knee and propose.

···

Vincent kept his foot heavy on the gas, racing back to the Jones family estate at speeds nearing 120kilometers per hour.

His phone rang partway through the drive, and Derek's voice came through the speaker. "Mr. Jones, I've managed to redecorate your room based on your sketch. Due to time constraints, the details leave room to improve."

"Alright," Vincent answered simply and hung up.

After that, the car fell silent again.

Hannah spent the entire trip staring out the window, refusing to look at Vincent or speak to him.

When they finally reached the house, Vincent didn't bother with small talk. He caught her wrist and dragged her straight upstairs.

"What do you think you're doing, Vincent?" Hannah tried to yank her hand free, but he didn't let go. Her bare feet barely kept upo as he yanked her into their bedroom on the second floor.

Vincent's hold was unyielding, and when he finally released her, she was thrown onto the bed.

"From now on, I want you to stay home and focus on planning Grandma's birthday celebration." His eyes stayed cold as he laid out his demands. "You're not to leave the house or spend time with anyone questionable, especially Felix."

A bitter laugh slipped from Hannah. "And why should I listen to you?" She got off the bed, her brow furrowed in anger. "You're out of line. Do you really think you can lock me up like a prisoner?"

Vincent swallowed, struggling to suppress his fury. "I am your husband."

She met his gaze, refusing to back down. "So what? Just because you're my husband doesn't mean you get to control my life."

Hannah stepped forward, jabbing her finger into his chest as she spoke with resolve."If I want to leave or see someone, that's for me to decide, not you." And it wouldn't be long before he was nothing more than her ex-husband.

Though her pokes were more defiant than forceful, Vincent's patience snapped, and on the third jab, he caught her wrist in his grip.

###Chapter 85 Is He Really That Great


Anger tightened every muscle in Vincent's jaw, his expression nearly black with frustration. "Now my grandmother's birthday means nothing to you? Only a week remains. She trusted you and handed over all the planning. But you just slipped out before sunrise to see another man."

A wave of numbness washed over Hannah. The way he kept repeating "another man"-as if thatwas the only story he could imagine-cut right through her. Not for a moment did he believe that she and Felix just had work to handle. In his world, she had no career, only the title of wife, forever playing house. That was the only version o her he could see. That was the only role he'd ever let her play.

A hollow ache settled deep in her chest. Eight years of her life, gone, wasted on this man. What did she even have to show for it? An illusion of "happiness." Even the love itself-fake. But there was one truth he hadn't exaggerated-seven days remained. Seven days left before the divorce papers would finally mean freedom.

A sharp,sarcastic laugh slipped from Hannah's lips. "You think my meeting Felix means I'm unfaithful? Then explain you and Brinley. Every single day, you find a reason to see her-how would you label that? Cheating on me?"

With a snap, Vincent tore off his tie, his voice rough with denial. "I've told you again and again-nothing is going on between me and Brinley!"

She didn't flinch. "Then it's not what you think between me and Felix either."

With that, Hannah wrenched her arm from his grasp and turned away, drawing a line he could not cross.

"Then why the hell did I find you woke up in his office? If I hadn't walked in, would you have gone home with him next?" Vincent questioned.

Anyone listening would have pegged Vincent's outburst as pure jealousy.

Hannah, however,recognized the truth. Jealousy had nothing to do with it. What fueled him now was pure fury. His ego had taken a direct hit. Keeping their marriage under wraps was one thing,but watching her share space with another man was something he couldn't tolerate.

No effort went into justifying herself. She didn't bother to console his wounded pride. "Believe whatever you want."

Without another glance, she pushed past him, making for the door.

In one swift motion, Vincent caught her by the wrist and tossed her back onto the mattress. "We're not done here.Where the fuck do you think you're going?"

A bitter laugh escaped Hannah as she glared at him. "So now I'm not even allowed to crash in the guest room?"

Rage flared in her cheeks. She tried to sit up, but Vincent swung a leg over her, trapping her in place.

Something unreadable flickered in his gaze, dark as midnight. "Is that what all this is about? Separate rooms, repeated talks of divorce-because of Felix?" His voice was taut, nearly trembling. "Is he really that great?"

Hannah's eyes flashed. "I told you, he's got nothing to do with it. Now get off me!"

Desperation took over as she bucked beneath him, her fists flying, but he easily trapped both wrists in his grasp.

With his features hidden in the half-light, Vincent hovered over her, unreadable. "Did you sleep with him?"

That single question turned Hannah to stone. So this was what he truly believed about her. A wave of tears threatened to spill, sharp and hot with shame, but she clamped down on them, refusing to give him that satisfaction. Long ago, she'd promised herself she would never again cry for Vincent.

"Bastard!" she spat out, her voice trembling with fury.

A jolt of clarity snapped through her as she drove her knee upward, fighting back with every ounce of strength.Both hands remained locked in his grip, or else she would have slapped him on the spot.

He drove her past the edge of reason. What on earth had drawn her to him in the first place? Had she really been so mesmerized by his handsomeness back then?

"Get off me.I said get-" The last word was swallowed as Vincent crushed his mouth against hers.

Every trace of tenderness was missing-his kiss crashed into her with raw, desperate hunger.

Refusing to yield, Hannah pressed her lips together, denying him entry.

A rough command escaped him."Let me in."

One hand snaked upward, gripping her jaw tightly. His thumb pressed harshly against her cheek, forcing her mouth apart.

"Mm-"

Without a pause, he plunged forward. His tongue invaded, grazing the roof of her mouth as his breath came hot and uneven against her face.
###Chapter 86 Angry Sex


Annoyance boiled inside Hannah, each second ramping up her frustration.

Her flailing legs knocked over the glass lamp by the bed. The sharp crash of shattering crystal sliced through the room, but Vincent didn't so much as flinch. He stayed locked to her mouth, unyielding.

Every second, the kiss intensified, raw and unrelenting. Jagged glass crackled underfoot, blending with the ragged, hungry sound of his breathing.

Losing patience, Hannah sank her teeth into his lower lip, hard enough to draw blood.

Vincent only grunted, tightening his hold as he pulled her closer, claiming her tongue with a fierce,possessive urgency that made her throat ache in resistance.

Several long moments passed before he finally broke away, shifting his weight off her and letting go of her wrists.

Roughly,Hannah wiped her mouth, her glare seething with disgust."Asshole!"

Vincent stared down at her, eyes dark, slowly unbuttoning his cuffs. He shrugged off his jacket, fingers moving to unbutton his shirt.

Alarm shot through Hannah. She scooted backward, her voice sharp."What are you doing?"

A cold, enigmatic smile flickered across his face."Thought I'd show you just how much of an asshole I can be."

He pinned her beneath him again. Fabric tore sharply as he ripped at the edge of her skirt, his movements rough and unforgiving. Instinct drove her to strike back, knee flying upward, but he intercepted her ankle mid-motion, dragging her beneath him once again.

Nails dug into his shoulder as she raked his skin, angry red lines blooming up his neck. "Vincent, don't even think about it-"

A dark, gutturaI reply met her words. "We're husband and wife, Hannah. Or has that slipped your mind?"

He kept her pinned beneath him, not backing off for an instant. "Besides, Grandma keeps asking when she'll have a great-grandchild. Figured today's as good a time as any to make that happen."

Those words hit her harder than any physical blow. The idea of a child-his careless mention-left her paralyzed, dredging up wounds she'd never healed. With quiet resistance, her palms pressed firmly into his chest, but she said nothing. Her head turned aside, her face void of expression.

A crease formed between Vincent's brows as he hesitated. "You're not willing?"

No answer left her lips.

That silence cut deeper than a shout. One strong hand snatched both her wrists, pinning them high above her head, closing any gap between them.

The sharp bite of his belt buckle pressed into her side, cold and unyielding.

His mouth found her collarbone, teeth scraping before he jerked the fabric apart-buttons skittered across the floor, the harsh snap echoing with her startled breath in the heavy hush.

No part of her was unfamiliar to him. As he glimpsed the flush rising to her ears, his breath grew ragged,heavier with each second.

Yet, his features stayed locked in place, unreadable, as his fingers worked the belt loose, raising what was left of her skirt and thrusting into her.

Through Hannah's blurred vision, she saw him looming over her, his shirt rumpled and half-untucked,the fabric clinging loosely to him, rising and falling with each restless breath.

Time after time, the cool cotton grazed her bare waist-a relentless mix of irritation and shivers.

Without uttering a word, she endured it all, teeth pressed hard into her lower lip.

A few rough grunts escaped Vincent, but from Hannah, not even a whimper broke the silence.

He kept at it, refusing to stop until darkness filled every corner of the room.

At last, when it ended, she sat up, reaching for her scattered clothes and slipping them back on, never once looking in his direction. Her voice sliced through the air, cold as steel. "You're terrible in bed. I didn't feel a damn thing. Maybe you should get some pointers from those male escorts-they actually know what they're doing."

No one could have missed the venom dripping from every syllable.
A scowl took over Vincent's face, and he twisted his lips into a sneer. "Look who's talking. You just lay there,stiff as a corpse. There was nothing to feel."

The second he finished, regret flickered across his face. His mouth opened, searching for an apology, but Hannah beat him to it. A harsh laugh broke from her. "Unbelievable. You feel nothing, but you still did it anyway. That must have been quite a sacrifice for you."

She spotted a pillow on the floor, snatched it up, and hurled it at him with a snap of her wrist.

It struck him squarely in the chest, and he stared back, features set in stone. "Yeah, sure. I'm the pathetic one. I'm the fool for wanting a family with you. Guess that's my mistake."

Blind anger had driven him-never the kind of impulse that guided the logical, measured Vincent Jones of old.

"Don't even mention children to me." Instantly, Hannah's features iced over. Her lips pressed into a thin line,breath coming sharper as her lashes quivered.

A chill flattened her words. "I will never have a child with you." That tiny, one-month-old heartbeat she had lost-nothing could ever heal that scar. With divorce drawing nearer every day, the thought of bringing a child into this mess was utterly unimaginable.

Hannah's rejection struck a nerve. Vincent let out a sharp, bitter breath of laughter. "If not me, then who,Hannah? Felix Wade?"
###Chapter 87 Redecorated For Her
Once again, the conversation circled back to Felix.


No energy remained in Hannah for explanations.Keeping her gaze on the floor, she retorted, "What if it is? Having a child with Felix is certainly better than with you. At least he's emotionally stable."


A cold shadow crossed Vincent's face. He parted his lips to speak, but nothing came out.


Hannah was fully aware her answer would cut deep.She didn't care. Vincent's mind had already made up its own story-he was sure she'd slept with Felix.Justifying herself felt pointless. The end of their marriage was near. He could believe whatever nonsense he wanted.


With her dress torn beyond repair, Hannah walked into the walk-in closet to hunt for anything remotely presentable. A random pair of pants was all she bothered to grab before slipping them on.
An uneasy silence stretched between them.


Emerging from the closet, she found Vincent perched on the edge of the bed, shirt half-unbuttoned, cigarette between his fingers, smoke curling upward in lazy spirals.


As soon as his eyes caught hers, he crushed the burning tip between his fingertips, snuffing it out.


Not a flicker of emotion crossed Hannah's face as she shot him a cool, indifferent look.


Without another word, she strode for the exit. Her hand barely brushed the doorknob before Vincent's voice stopped her. "Hannah."


Refusing to react, she pushed the door open.


Before she could leave, Vincent moved to block her path. "Didn't you see anything different about this room?" he asked.


Her response was flat. "I noticed. What of it?"


The change hadn't escaped her attention the moment she entered. Walls, furniture, every detail had returned to their original design-except for the missing crib in the corner. None of it meant.anything to her. For all she knew, Vincent could have done it to please Brinley. Perhaps Brinley's taste ran just as minimalist and elegant as her own. There was no way it was meant for her.



"Brinley must be on your mind a lot," Hannah remarked, delivering the observation with ease.


A frown creased Vincent's brow. "This has nothing to do with Brinley. I reset the room for you, and you're still not happy?"


A sharp, mocking laugh escaped Hannah. For her?Yeah,like she would believe.


With one firm motion, she tried to push Vincent aside. "Out of the way. I'm sleeping in the guest room."


A shadow fell over Vincent's expression. "I went out of my way to change this room's decoration back just because of your complaints, and yet you're not A pulsing vein stood out on his forehead. "Grandma's birthday is around the corner. Are you planning to stay angry with me until then? It's been days, and your outburst should have a limit."


An icy wave ran through Hannah. He had no real grasp of what this room represented in their lives. No -what it meant to her. In his mind, a little redecorating should magically erase all the damage.But some things can't be fixed by rolling back the clock. And worse, he always thought it was her problem. To him, she was just throwing a tantrum.


A biting, cold laugh slipped past Hannah's lips."Exactly! I just always throw a wobbly. If it's such a problem, then stop dragging it out-just divorce me.Brinley can move right into this newly decorated room. You can put that missing crib back in the corner, and the two of you can-"


"Hannah Scott!" Vincent interjected with a sharp,urgent shout.
She clenched her jaw. "What, did I strike a nerve?"


Once again, they'd reached a standoff.


Her hand shot out, aiming to get around him. But Vincent wouldn't let her pass. "I redecorated everything in here for you."


Hannah looked at him, her gaze steady and emotionless. "Maybe you did it for me, but where were you before any of this? Is patching things up after the damage was caused the only way you know? Some things, once they're broken, never go back to how they were-no matter what you fix. This room looks like before, but it doesn't feel like home.Some changes can't be reversed, Vincent, even if you try."



Much like her relationship with Vincent, once something was wrecked, it could never truly go back.


With barely any effort, Hannah brushed him aside."I'll take the guest room. This place doesn't feel like mine anymore."
Vincent watched Hannah's resolute silhouette,feeling the distance between them growing with every step she took. Defeat weighing him down, he wandered back inside the room and sparked a new cigarette.


Meanwhile, Hannah sat alone in the guest room,swallowing a contraceptive pill before pulling the covers over herself and willing her mind to shut off.
###Chapter 88 Scratched By A Cat
With Sharon's birthday drawing near, the Jones estate buzzed with constant movement and busy energy.


Hosts practiced their parts in one corner while decorators transformed every room in sight.


Most of Hannah's days remained devoted to her work at Nova Tech, but any spare time she found was spent overseeing the birthday banquet preparations back at the estate. Communication with Vincent had ceased entirely since that last confrontation.


Progress on Nova Tech's latest product couldn't have gone better-something that gave Hannah a rare sense of satisfaction in the middle of everything else.


If Sharon hadn't insisted on her company at nearly every evening meal, Hannah would gladly have buried herself in the office.

One day, catching Hannah just after a meeting, Felix suggested, "Let's grab lunch at the mall and go for a shopping session today."


A puzzled look crossed Hannah's face. "Why the sudden urge to shop?"


Felix's tone turned earnest. "You're the reason the hormone monitor bracelet project is moving SO quickly."


Hannah replied, never one to take all the credit,"Really, it's the result of the team's efforts."


Without the collective effort, she knew the project would never have come this far so fast.


Felix's smile returned. "Everyone on the team will see bonuses, and you deserve a reward too."


She shook her head, lips curving with gratitude."That's thoughtful, Felix, but it isn't necessary."


His determination didn't waver. "Well, I insist on rewarding you. Either join me today, or I'll be waiting at the mall until you do."
"Alright, alright, you win." A burst of laughter followed Hannah as she exited the room.


No sooner had the door clicked shut than Felix retrieved a small jewelry box hidden beneath his notebook.


Inside, nestled in velvet, lay a gold bracelet engraved with a delicate yellow rose-Hannah's favorite flower.


For days, he'd meant to present it to her under the excuse of appreciation for the project's success,yet nerves always held him back. Eventually, he settled on the mall outing as the perfect coverto finally give her the gift.



Jewelry box in hand, Felix made his way to the mall,rehearsing how he might deliver his surprise.



***



Meanwhile, Vincent's workload had reached a breaking point. At first, he'd imagined a month off would be enough to get close to Hannah again, but now he doubted even three months would suffice.

In the secretarial pool, stress was at a boiling point.Work meant for an entire quarter was now squeezed into a single frantic week.



On the other side of town, Brinley reeled from her recent loss at acquiring Nova Tech and set her sights on fresh opportunities.


One particular company-a leader in hit mobile games for women-caught her attention. Despite its runaway popularity, mismanagement and weak monetization had left the business teetering on bankruptcy.


Brinley saw enormous potential. She believed the key to any great product, especially those aimed at women, was understanding their desires-she got that right, and the market would always follow.


Vincent's relentless schedule meant he was not available when Brinley wanted him to join her for the acquisition, forcing her to manage negotiations alone. Now, all that stood between her and the deal was a signature on the final contract.
Their asking price was five million-a figure that immediately reminded her of Nova Tech's last negotiation.Confidence fueled her every step. She felt certain Vincent would greenlight the investment.


Brinley made her way to Vincent's office this morning, as informed by Clive.


One look at Vincent and her eyes caught the faint red marks across his neck, still visible even after a couple of days. She couldn't hold back any longer and asked about them. He brushed it off, claiming he was scratched by a cat.


Brinley wasn't convinced for a second. Given the cold tension she'd seen between Hannah and Vincent at the estate, she quickly pieced things together-those marks had Hannah written all over them. Clearly, a major fight had erupted between the couple, and the aftermath was pure silence.


Watching their relationship unravel brought a secret sense of satisfaction to Brinley-the more explosive their arguments, the closer they moved to divorce.

Standing by Vincent's desk, Brinley set the contract in front of him. "Vincent, I'm nearly finished with the acquisition talks. This is the draft for the game company-please review it."


He peered up at her, eyebrow raised. "So, Nova Tech's off your radar?"


A slight shrug accompanied her answer. "Chances of getting Nova Tech are slim to noné. After you left, I tried persuading Felix for quite a while. He's holding firm, so I turned my attention to another company that's got plenty of potential."


"Alright," Vincent murmured, already absorbed in the contract. For a while, Brinley lingered nearby,noticed his mug was empty, and without missing a beat,brewed him a new cup of coffee before quietly setting it at his side.


A small flicker of acknowledgement crossed Vincent's face as he watched her. "Brinley, you really don't have to do all this."


"That's just it, Vincent-I want to," she replied, her smile soft and unwavering.


Running errands for him, however minor, brought Brinley genuine contentment. This was the life she'd always imagined. If they married, she'd manage every detail of his world. Quiet optimism lingered in her heart, fueling her daily efforts.


She continued finding tasks to busy herself with, and after a while, Vincent stopped protesting and let her be.



Once her hands were idle, Brinley glanced at her phone and noticed the time had slipped right up to noon. "How about grabbing lunch together?" she suggested, hopeful.


Vincent didn't look up, his pen moving steadily over the page. "I'm not hungry," came his brief reply.


Before Brinley could coax him further, her phone buzzed with a new notification. A message had just landed in a high-profile group chat-a photo of Felix and Hannah together, instantly igniting rumors that Hannah had found a new benefactor after being dumped by Vincent.


Excitement flashed in Brinley's eyes as she picked up on the location of Felix and Hannah were seen. She turned toward Vincent with a meaningful look."Vincent, I was thinking about shopping for a present for Sharon's birthday. Would you go with me?"


A curt reply came from him. "I'm tied up today."


A hint of disappointment clouded Brinley's features."Alright, I'll let you work. I'll just pick something out on my own. Still, after what Sharon has said about me before, I'm afraid she won't like whatever l choose."



At that, Vincent checked his watch and clicked the cap onto his pen. "You have twenty minutes, that's all I can spare."

###Chapter 89 A Bracelet For Her

Silvercrest Mall was positioned just a short walk from the Nova Tech headquarters.



Felix took Hannah out there for lunch first, having reserved an upscale dining spot with a calm, elegant atmosphere-ideal for a quiet break together.


Though the setting invited ease, Hannah's mind stayed locked on the hormone-monitoring wristband.Their conversation hovered around the project.


After slicing his steak, Felix slid his plate across the table.



Hannah gently nudged it back. "I've got it. Thanks,though."


But he insisted, sliding it toward her once more."Come on. You're the brain behind this whole thing."


She gave a light smile. "You're overstating it just a little, don't you think?"


His tone shifted, serious now. "Not really. That wristband-it's genius. The product reminded me of the early days of Nova Tech-full of energy and life."


Back when the company was at its lowest-on the brink of bankruptcy-they'd pivoted toward male-centric products out of necessity, a strategy that led to repeated setbacks and lackluster outcomes.Thankfully, the tides had shifted. Nova Tech was once more headed in a favorable direction. Felix felt a flush of satisfaction.



Felix spoke. "Stop refusing the plate of steak, or l might start feeling hurt."


He winked playfully at her, making Hannah chuckle.


"Well,thank you then."



"Don't mention it."



The lightheartedness faded as Hannah steered the conversation back to work.

Felix quipped with a lopsided smile, "Don't tell me you're dreaming about the wristband project at night."


She tilted her head. "Nope. When I go to bed, I don't dream at all-I sleep straight through till morning."


Her daily schedule drained her completely-research by day, planning the birthday festivities by evening-leaving no space for restless thoughts.


No pointless worries. No constant tension. Just focus, direction, and a sense of control. That was Hannah's version of contentment.


Felix looked genuinely relieved for her, but after a moment, his brow furrowed with concern. He paused, voice low. "Last time, with Vincent...Everything okay?"


"Nothing worthy to fret over," she replied, a faint smile flickering, though not quite holding. "We're getting divorced. What's there to stress about?"


Their recent conflict had been explosive, and now they were in the middle of a sient war. Neither made a move to bridge the gap.


And for Hannah, that silence was bliss. No passive-aggressive stares. No pointless arguments. Just peace. That was all she needed.


"I'm really glad to hear that," Felix said softly. His eyes lowered. "So, when are you finalizing it?"


"Not long now. Just a few more days." Time kept pushing forward. Only five more remained until Vincent's grandmother's birthday.


At her answer, a subtle delight flickered in Felix's eyes.


The lunch ended on an easy note, and Hannah expressed her thanks more than once before they left the restaurant.


Afterward, Felix guided her toward a jewelry boutique.


Hannah glanced around, intrigued. "Picking something for someone? Your mom or your girlfriend?"


He didn't answer. Instead, he exchanged a brief look with the store clerk.


"Sir, this piece might interest you," the clerk offered.


Felix lifted a slender bracelet, holding it up for Hannah to see. "What do you think of this one?"


She studied it carefully. "The floral detail is really intricate. It's beautiful."


Felix's lips curved slightly. He shot a glance at the clerk, who caught on right away. "I'll help you try it on," the clerk offered, stepping in.


"Wait-I'm not-" Hannah instinctively pulled back,her eyes darting to Felix for help.


"Perfect," he said with a grin. "Try it on for me."


The clerk moved quickly. Before Hannah could protest again, bracelet was already clasped around her wrist.



Felix's eyes gleamed. "See? Fits you like it was made for you."


Hannah reached to undo the clasp, eager to return it -but just then, a scornful voice rang out across the room. "Look who it is. Mr. Jones's kept woman.What happened-did he throw you out already?"
###Chapter 90 Witty Comeback

Hannah turned with a cold stare as the voice cut through the air. A pack of well-dressed young men strolled over, each one flanked by a woman clinging to his arm.



Out in front walked Issac Stanley, a face Hannah instantly recognized.



Issac carried a reputation for arrogance and lack of manners, and it was he who had recently embarrassed Hannah in public.


Issac's gaze flicked to Felix as he taunted, "So,Hannah, this is your new benefactor? He doesn't seem impressive at all." He followed that up with a mocking laugh. "What's this about? After leaving Vincent, this is all you could snag?"


Laughter broke out among his friends, their amusement echoing behind him.

The insult stung, and Felix's brow furrowed as he moved forward, but Hannah quietly caught his arm to hold him back. She saw this as her own battle and didn't need Felix to fight for her. She could handle it.


Spreading rumors and gossiping behind people's backs had always been these people's favorite pastime, and she had heard much worse over the years. Now, such words didn't faze her in the slightest.


Standing her ground, Hannah locked eyes with Issac."Mr. Stanley, it's been some time. I heard your stepmother is about to bring a baby into this world soon.Congratulations on becoming a big brother!"


She knew exactly where to hit, thanks to Rena's tip.


Rena, fed up with how these spoiled heirs mistreated Hannah, had quietly given her the inside scoop.


Issac's biological mother had passed away early,leaving his father to remarry. Now, with a new sibling on the way and no position in the family business,Issac's pride was on shaky ground.
A scowl darkened Issac's features. "So you've been investigating around about me?" He stepped in closer, voice dripping with contempt. "I get it now.You're after me next, aren't you?"


To his mind, if she wanted him as a backer, she should have made her move instead of playing games.


Within their social circle, there were even bets on when Vincent would toss Hannah aside, and who would get to claim her next. It wasn't about love. It was all about her looks and the thrill of getting laid with her.Each man in the group eyed her with hungry interest, hoping to be the one to keep her around.


Hannah only responded with a cold smirk and an exasperated roll of her eyes.


Issac let his eyes wander over her, making no effort to hide it. He dropped his date's hand right away. "In that case, here's my offer. Serve me for a month, and I'll pay you this much." With a smug grin, he flashed a single finger, signaling the amount.
Hannah fixed him with a look of pure disdain. "Really,Mr. Stanley? Are you this stingy even when hiring a housekeeper?"


He bristled. "Who said anything about a housèkeeper? And you think a million isn't enough?"


A shrug was all she gave. "I don't think I have misunderstood anything. For Vincent, a million is spare change." Her hand shot up'to her lips as a thought seemed to dawn on her. "Oh, that's right.There's no way your family can measure up to the Jones family."


Issac's cheeks flamed with fury. "You-" He faltered,clenching his fists. "In the end, Vincent still dumped you. How could you still parade around with that attitude?"


"Guess I need to spell it out for you." Disdain laced her words as she met his gaze. "When you don't have the means, Mr. Stanley, don't entertain the idea of keeping a woman around. It's humiliating."


The gathered crowd erupted in laughter, unable to contain themselves.


Shame flooding his face, Issac lunged toward Hannah, intent on making her pay.


Felix was there in an instant, stepping between them,his eyes flashing a clear warning.


Hannah didn't hesitate to whip out her phone and snap a flurry of photos aimed at Issac and his crew.


A sly grin spread across her face as she stepped out from behind Felix, holding her phone high in the air."Mr. Stanley, if I were you, I'd gather up your friends and your date and leave right now. Otherwise, these photos are going straight to the internet. Imagine the scandal-keeping women on the side and stirring up drama in public. Your reputations won't recover.Think about your father, Mr. Stanley. If he catches wind of this, you'll only give him more reason to dote on your unborn brother instead."



Panic washed over Issac, draining the color from his face, and his companions hurried to drag him away before things got worse. They knew better than to take her threats lightly. One by one, they made their exit.



Felix watched Hannah with concern. This wasn't the first time she'd faced such insults and slander."Getting a divorce is for the best," he said, giving her a gentle look.
###Chapter 91 Use Me For A Fit Test





Hannah paused for a split second before catching on to the message behind Felix's words. A quick grin crossed her face as she beckoned to the store clerk,wanting to take off the bracelet.


A gentle interruption from Felix stopped the clerk from approaching. "Leave it on."


Confusion flickered across Hannah's face. "Shouldn't I take it off? I thought this was for someone else?"


With a shy rub at his neck, Felix admitted, "It is for someone. That someone is you."


The words caught Hannah off guard, making her freeze. "Wait, what?" Why would Felix suddenly be giving her a present?


Eager to clear things up, Felix continued, "Remember how I promised you a reward for your hard work?This is it."
A slightly embarrassed laugh slipped from Hannah."Oh...I misunderstood..."



Felix leaned in, curious. "Misunderstood how?"


Her gaze dropped to the bracelet as she fiddled with it. "I assumed lunch was my reward. But honestly,this bracelet is gorgeous.I really love it."


Felix masked his disappointment, a gentle smile returning. "I'm glad you like it."


He exchanged a glance with the clerk, mimed a payment gesture, and then led Hannah out of the shop, the bracelet still shining on her wrist.


Plans to return to the office faded when Hannah came to an abrupt stop in front of a men's suit boutique on the third floor.


Felix gave her a curious glance. "Something catch your eye?"


"I want to take a look at some suits," Hannah replied,already making her way inside. Felix kept pace, right on her heels.

"What's with the sudden interest in men's suits?" His tone was light.


A sheepish smile crept across Hannah's face. "You remember Miles Whitaker? He lent me his jacket once, and I ended up losingit. I need to find a replacement to return."


Every detail of the original suit-pattern, fabric,cut-remained vivid in her memory as she sifted through the display options.


"Got it." Felix gave a simple nod, offering quiet company as she searched.


"The only issue," Hannah continued, "is I'm not sure of Miles's exact measurements. You two are built pretty similarly, though. Mind being my stand-in for sizing?"


She gave him a quick, appraising once-over.


A grin spread across Felix's face. "I'm all yours-use me for a fit test."
Meanwhile, Brinley had taken Vincent all the way to Silvercrest Mall, the drive alone costing ten minutes.


A glance at his watch, and Vincent's frown deepened. "There's a luxury mall right next to the Jones Group building. What's the point of coming all the way out here?"


Brinley flashed a bright smile. "This mall is brand new, Vincent. They might carry something really exclusive. Just give it a look with me, please?"


"Ten minutes. That's all," Vincent warned, making no effort to hide his impatience.


"Absolutely," she replied, though she had no intention of sticking to his time limit. The moment he caught sight of Hannah shopping around with Felix,she doubted he'd care about how long they stayed.


Since Hannah refused to keep her distance from Felix, Brinley figured she couldn't be blamed. She was merely giving things a little extra push.


Brinley's hands drifted from display to display,but her thoughts never lingered on the merchandise.Every few seconds, her eyes darted to the entrances of each store,searching for Hannah and Felix.


Vincent trailed Brinley from shop to shop, all the way up to the third floor, still empty-handed.


Another look at his watch, and his patience snapped -ten minutes had come and gone. He'd had enough."Brinley, take all the time you want picking something out. I have to get back to work."


Brinley darted into Vincent's path, blocking his exit."Please don't leave yet, Vincent. You're already here.Just help me pick out a gift. I really want your grandmother to like me."


Her tone sounded earnest, but her gaze slid right past him. She was far more interested in the faces drifting by, intent on spotting Hannah and Felix in the crowd. This was the mall mentioned in the group chat, yet she hadn't caught even a glimpse of them.Maybe they'd missed their window-or perhaps the two had already slipped away.
Vincent's irritation was building, and he was on the verge of brushing past her when Brinley let out a sudden, dramatic gasp. "Look over there-aren't those Hannah and Mr. Wade? What are they doing together at this mall?"
###Chapter 92 Buying Clothes For Another Man
Vincent pivoted, his gaze sharpening as he caught sight of Hannah through the glossy storefront. She stood inches from Felix, fingertips smoothing the lapel of his suit with practiced care, their proximity laced with a warmth that could only belong to lovers.


A shadow crossed Vincent's face. He pushed open the glass door and strode toward the store, radiating a quiet intensity.


Brinley noticed the shift and, with a knowing smirk,slipped in right after him.


Meanwhile, inside the store, Hannah insisted that the clerk fetch every possible shade of deep indigo suit in Felix's size as she tried to purchase one similar to that lent by Miles.


When Felix finally emerged from the fitting room, his tie hung askew, and Hannah immediately rose on tiptoe, fingers deft as she adjusted the knot against his.chest.


Felix froze under her touch, breath hitching,awkwardness etched into every line of his body.


"This one's too loose," Hannah remarked, appraising the suit with a critical eye. The cut reminded her of the suit Miles had lent her, though this one, she thought wryly, couldn't compete in either craftsmanship or sentiment.


As she mulled it over, the piercing chime of the door shattered her thoughts. A man swept inside,his presence electric with anger.


Hannah picked up a smaller suit, ready to hand it to Felix to try on, but a hand seized her and pulled her roughly against a broad, unyielding chest.


The scent-unmistakable. She jerked her head up,her breath catching. Vincent? A second later, she noticed Brinley following close behind and pieced it together instantly-Vincent had brought Brinley along for shopping.


Hannah tore herself free, putting several feet between her and Vincent.



Vincent stood rooted to the spot, his gaze sharp as a blade, brimming with hurt and rage. His jaw tightened, voice cutting and cold. "So you're out buying clothes for another man, Hannah? Do I mean nothing to you now?"


Each breath he took was heavy, chest heaving as anger twisted across his features.


Felix interjected with a steady, measured tone, "Mr.Jones, maybe we should hear everyone out before making any accusations."


"Shut up!" Vincent shot back, not sparing him a glance. His attention was locked on Hannah, gaze unyielding."Explain."


A humorless smirk curled at the edge of Hannah's lips. "You saw everything. What more do you need to hear?" Brinley glided forward, her voice soft and soothing,stepping neatly into the tension. "Vincent, please,don't work yourself up. It could all be a misunderstanding. Hannah, just tell him what really happened-don't be so quick to shut him out."


Once again, Brinley seized the chance to project herself as gentle and understanding while subtly undermining Hannah.


Hannah's laughter was low and sharp. "You really do love playing the reasonable voice, don't you? But whatever's going on here is between me and Vincent. You really don't get a say in it since you're just a shameless homewrecker."


Though Hannah didn't raise her voice, every word cut through the air, drawing stares from a cluster of nearby shoppers.


Brinley flinched under the judgmental gazes,tears threatening to spill as she instinctively sought out Vincent for help.


Vincent's eyes went cold. He fixed Hannah with a look that could freeze fire, jaw clenched tight."That's enough, Hannah. Don't test me."


Hannah barely flinched. She'd long since grown numb to Vincent's instinctive move of shielding Brinley, no matter the circumstance. Stone-faced,her voice edged with frost, she said, "This is how l talk. Don't like it? There's the door. Kindly leave us alone. We have things to do."


A hollow sound escaped Vincent, something closer to a bark than a laugh. "Last time you were busy napping in his office. Now you're handpicking suits.What's next, a cozy family dinner at his place?" He felt she was deliberately getting under his skin.


His words drew even more attention from bystanders in the store.


Felix's expression tightened in disapproval, while Brinley-back turned to the crowd-couldn't suppress a tiny, smug curve of her lips.


Hannah caught Vincent's glare, his voice sharp with accusation. For a fleeting second, she saw a reflection of the hysterical version of herself from the past. The difference was-hers came from love. His outburst, though, reeked of nothing but wounded ego. But it didn't matter anymore.


Hannah fixed Vincent with a frosty, unflinching stare,refusing to waste even a single word in reply.


The moment broke as the sales assistant returned,arms full of suits arranged with meticulous care. "Ms.Scott, I've brought the rest of the indigo options for your boyfriend to try on."
###Chapter 93 Who Am I To You

 No explanation left Hannah's lips-just a soft "thank you."


As Hannah reached out for the suit from the sales assistant, Felix quietly stepped in to take it for her.Not once did he bother to set the record straight about being her boyfriend.


A brief glance passed between them, their understanding wordless and effortless.


Brinley's eyes darted from Hannah and Felix to Vincent,noting the storm gathering on his face.


Vincent's jaw clenched, and his gaze grew sharp and frigid, his attention locked on Hannah. "Wow.Upgraded to acknowledge him as your boyfriend already?"


Vincent was really livid. Only days ago, they'd been fighting, yet Hannah had already paraded around with the statement that she was with someone else.He saw through it-she wanted a reaction from him,and she knew exactly how to get under his skin. Felix was just the pawn for her little performance. Still,their closeness made a muscle jump at his temple.


Hannah's reply was calm, her tone cold. "Don't you already have chosen another woman to remarry Soon?"



She couldn't fathom his audacity in throwing accusations her way. Wedding dresses, renovations,this little shopping excursion-did he just make preparations for his big day with Brinley this time?Not that it mattered to her anymore.


Hannah's gaze flicked briefly to Brinley before she turned back to Vincent, her voice cool and dismissive. "If you're both finished, please move.We're busy here."


With that, her focus went back to the suits, while Felix continued watching her intently.


A humorless laugh escaped Vincent. Was she really telling him he was in her way? Unbelievable. A single step brought him closer as he reached out, aiming to seize HHannah's wrist. "You're coming with me."


With reflexes sharpened by experience, Hannah slipped neatly behind Felix, dodging Vincent's grasp before he could touch her. Vincent's hand met nothing but empty air.


Her instinctive retreat deepened the shadows on Vincent's face. "Come here," he said, his words taut and icy enough to send a chill through the store.


Hannah didn't flinch. "I'm staying right where | am.This time, you don't get to force me."


She refused to let herself be humiliated again. That ###Chapter was closed. Her eyes locked with his, steady and fearless.


Vincent stood motionless, the word "force" ringing in his ears like a blow. Instantly, he was dragged back to memories of that day in the bedroom. Apparently,that was how she saw him now. A man who relied on force. For a moment, anger, remorse, and confusion 
warred in his gaze. His throat worked, but no words came out.


Brinley, quietly triumphant, decided she'd seen enough. There was no point hanging around for another endless fight. She gently patted Vincent on the shoulder. "Vincent, let's go. It's obvious Hannah has more important things to do."


Another glance and Vincent caught sight of Hannah and Felix, standing so close together, laughter and gentle exchange passing between them. A storm brewed in his eyes as he shot them a glare sharp enough to cut glass.


Vincent's phone broke the tension-a call from Clive,who hurriedly informed him about a sudden international meeting. Ending the call, Vincent's eyes returned to Hannah, still dark and unreadable.


Vincent paused, voice cold and unforgiving, before turning to leave. "If you still care about my grandmother,remember your place."


Not so much as a blink came from Hannah. "And what place is that, exactly?" she asked, meeting his gaze head-on.


Vincent said nothing.


She pushed further, her lips twisting with a bitter edge."What exactly do I need to be mindful of? Who am I to you,really?"


Her lips twitched. She was just someone he kept in the shadows-never good enough to claim,always expected to act "properly" while he paraded Brinley for everyone to see. Now, he wanted her to stay in line when all she did was hang out with a business partner? How absurd.


No response came from him, nor did she expect one.Disappointment was a feeling she'd long since abandoned. It was the same pattern, always-if Vincent didn't want to answer, silence would settle in like fog.


Felix, off to the side, watched Hannah with steady,quiet sympathy, his heart twisting at the pain he saw in her eyes.

Not a single word left Vincent's lips. In silence, he turned away, Brinley falling in step beside him.


It was exactly as Hannah had expected. He always left without a word to the key question. He always had. Nothing about him had ever really changed.But she had-she no longer wasted her breath on questions that would only hang in the air unanswered. Gone were the days of chasing him,who would never turn back for her. Her priorities had shifted. From here on out, she'd start living for herself.


Letting those thoughts drift away, Hannah picked up the suit and handed it to Felix.


Without a word, Felix disappeared into the fitting room, emerging every so often until she found a jacket that fit him just right.


Hannah presented the chosen suit to the sales assistant. "We'll take this one. Please have it wrapped up."


"Right away."

Felix pulled out his wallet, ready to pay.


Hannah gently stopped him, firm but kind. "Don't even start-today's expenses are already on you. Let me handle this."


He just gave a little shrug, a gentle smile lightig up his face. "Alright."


On their way back to the office, Felix kept sneaking glances her way, clearly deep in thought.


She caught on and slowed her steps, turning to meet his gaze. "What is it? Do I have something on my face?"



He closed the distance, eyes searching hers for answers he couldn't quite put aside. At last, he gave voice to the question that had haunted him. "May I ask... Why did you ever marry Vincent?"


Felix had always wondered. From the outside, it had always seemed like Vincent didn't even like Hannah.How had she ever said yes to a man who offered so little in return?
A quiet, rueful smile curved Hannah's lips. "It's been five years," she said in a low voice. "I honestly think I've forgotten."

###Chapter 94 Vincent's Taste ls Appalling
The past was the past. Hannah had no desire to revisit it-her focus stayed ahead. Her pursuit of Vincent had been driven by his good looks, and their ending marked by a broken vow. How disgraceful.


Hannah's voice carried casual ease, but Felix's eyes betrayed a trace of pity.


Soon after, Hannah and Felix returned to their workplace.


Once seated, Hannah placed the bag containing the suit by her chair when her phone buzzed with a new alert.


Brinley had sent yet another image. It showed a close-up of her left ring finger, adorned with a new band."Vincent picked out our ring. Isn't it lovely?"


Hannah released a hollow chuckle. No wonder she had bumped into Vincent and Brinley earlier-he'd been out choosing wedding rings with Brinley. The wedding gown, the bedding, and now the ring. They were ticking off every ceremony milestone.


Hannàh tapped open the chat with Brinley and wrote."Hideous thing. Vincent's taste is appalling."


Then, Hannah blocked Brinley. She wouldn't allow anyone to ruin her day anymore.






Vincent headed back to his office, while Brinley returned to the Jones estate.


Upon seeing Hannah's reply, Brinley attempted to respond with, "Already upset, huh?" But the message wouldn't go through. She'd been blocked.


Burning with anger, Brinley muttered a curse beneath her breath.


As soon as Danica learned of Brinley's return, she emerged from her room with a warm welcome."Brinley, want something to eat?"

"I'm good, Mrs. Jones." Brinley linked her arm with Danica's and guided Danica to the sofa. Grinning slyly, she leaned in and murmured, "Guess who Vincent and I ran into today."


"Who?"



"Hannah," Brinley drawled lazily.


Danica's face immediately twisted with disdain."Did she try to stir up trouble again? Gee! That woman pops up everywhere. Always going on about how she's done with Vincent, but clearly she still cares-probably following you two around."


Brinley wasn't done. "Actually, she wasn't alone. A man was by her side."


"What?" Danica's brows shot up. "She's seeing someone already? How dare she cheat on my son!"Her voice rose with outrage. "No wonder she's signed those divorce documents so quickly. She already had someone else lined up! Did Vincent see her with another man?"

Brinley gave a confirming nod. "He did. For the second time."


Danica's voice turned razor-sharp. "That tramp! Not even legally single, and already hanging on another man? Utterly disgraceful. Thank heavens Vincent is walking away from her."


Danica rose in a rush. "I'm going to confront her myself."


Brinley stepped in. "Hold on-don't go storming off just yet. We need something solid. If you charge in now, she'll just deny it."


"What's the plan, then?"


Brinley stroked her jaw thoughtfully as she laid it out."We stay quiet for now. We can't alert her. And Sharon must not hear a word. Let's gather proof before we expose everything."


Danica inhaled sharply, working to smother her rage."Alright. We'll do this your way."
Meanwhile, at the Jones Group headquarters, Derek walked into Vincent's office with an update in hand."Mr. Jones, regarding the redecoration of your room,some furniture is on the way-you still want me to arrange it according to the draft you provided?"


"No longer necessary," Vincent answered coolly,eyes glued to the document in front of him.


"Understood. I'll cancel the orders. Though the crib's a problem. That supplier doesn't accept returns,"Derek muttered as he neared the door, only to be halted. "Hold on."



Derek quickly turned back. "Yes? Anything else?"


"Keep the crib."


"Alright. Where should I place it?"


Vincent gave him a frosty look."My home has plenty of rooms. Can't you just pick one to place it?"


"Got it." Derek nodded in compliance, completely in the dark about the meaning behind the change.

Vincent's abrupt shift in demeanor sent a cold ripple through the secretarial department. No one dared breathe too loudly.


Vincent stared at the contract lying before him. It was his third read-and not a word had registered.With a grunt, he grabbed his phone. No messages from Hannah. As expected.


Then, he noticed the buzz in the elite social group chat. Curious, he clicked inside. The topic of the day? Hannah.


Vincent's glare darkened with each message. Crude remarks, vulgar flirts, and lustful words-aimed squarely at Hannah.


He swiped past the filth, fists clenching-until a single image froze him solid. In it, a sales assistant fastened a bracelet on Hannah's wrist. Standing beside Hannah was Felix, his gaze on her, all gentle and tender.


Vincent's face clouded over. So that was why Hannah brought a suit for Felix. Felix had gifted her first. They looked every bit like a couple in a loving relationship.


Vincent's laugh was sharp, jagged, and bitter. His eyes were ablaze with silent fury.
###Chapter 95 Waited For Her Return At Home
Messages flooded the group chat, each more inflammatory than the last.


Vincent scrolled through them, his face unreadable but for the sharp line of his jaw and a muscle ticking in his cheek. Without a word, he summoned the legal team and thrust his phone at the nearest attorney.


The company attorney accepted it with clammy hands, nerves spiking-why would the CEO hand over his phone?


Vincent's voice cut through the tension, cold and absolute. "File lawsuits against everyone in that group chat for spreading rumors."


The attorney tensed, curious what messages in a group chat could rattle the CEO so badly. Leaning in,he scanned the group members and immediately felt  cold sweat trickle down his spine. Those weren't nobodies but heirs to Dorbarrow's most powerful families.


The attorney cleared his throat, voice wavering."Mr.Jones,are you absolutely certain?"


Vincent slammed his pen onto the contract, leaned back in his leather chair, and shot the attorney a razor-sharp look. "Yeah. Is that going to be an issue?"



A glacial look swept across Vincent's face, slicing through the air like a blade.


A bead of cold sweat rolled down the attorney's temple. "Not at all.I am on it."


Vincent offered no further instructions, so the attorney quickly made his exit, moving with the caution of someone tiptoeing past a sleeping predator.


All afternoon, Vincent remained in a foul mood.Anyone unlucky enough to enter his office found themselves on the receiving end of his wrath.


By four, he'd had enough. Lingering in the office wouldn't change much since his mind always wandered to Hannah, his efficiency affected. Leaving work early, he drove straight home-only to find no sign of Hannah.


He loosened his subtly patterned tie, barely masking his irritation, and called out to the housekeeper,"Where is my wife?"


"She still hasn't returned," Aubrey replied, her voice careful.


His expression darkened further, the tension in the foyer ratcheting up another notch.


She hurried to add, "Your mother set off shopping with Miss Gilbert and ought to be home shortly.Meanwhile, your grandmother went out to play chess with a few friends."


Vincent's gaze stayed heavy. "Alright."


"If that's everything, I'll go back to work," she said slipping away as quietly as possible.


Aubrey had barely taken a step before Vincent's voice cut through the quiet once more. "Has my wife been returning home late recently?"


He drifted toward the sofa, dropped into its cushions,and started undoing his cuffs, each motion deliberate, his features set in a frosty mask.


Aubrey hesitated and then answered honestly, "Yes.But only a little earlier than you each time."


The temperature in the air seemed to plummet.Vincent's glare sharpened, and a chill settled over the whole place.


Trying to ease the tension, Aubrey brought over a glass of juice, placing it within easy reach.


Vincent ignored it, perching on the living room sofa as he stared at the door.



Brinley and Danica were the first to return.


Brinley, spotting Vincent home early for once,

  brightened instantly and slipped onto the sofa beside him, launching into breezy small talk.


By seven o'clock, as dinner beckoned, Sharon strolled back through the door.


Vincent claimed his lack of appetite and skipped the meal, crossing his arms on the sofa and keeping his gaze on the doorway.


By eight o'clock, Danica wNas deep in conversation with Brinley, while Vincent remained anchored to the same spot, eyes unwavering, waiting for Hannah.


When Sharon had gone to bed at nine, Brinley lingered, offering to keep Vincent company. But he waved her off with a sharp, impatient gesture,sending her upstairs.



It was five past ten when the door finally opened and Hannah stepped inside.


Vincent had been waiting on the living room sofa all this time, a storm brewing in his eyes as she finally came back. "Do you even know what time it is? You still remember this is your home?"


Hannah's mind had spun with details about Nova Tech's product line, so absorbed that she didn't register Vincent's presence in the living room.The unexpected sound of his voice jolted her out of her thoughts.


And honestly, she couldn't fathom what right he had to question her like this. It was just ten o'clock-what was the big deal? And she'd already let Sharon know she'd be back. And hadn't he himself stayed out all night before?


Her irritation flared. "It's just after ten. Don't act like I've been out all night. And since when do you clock my curfew?"


His scowl deepened, a muscle ticking in his jaw.


Refusing to indulge him, Hannah turned toward the stairs, but Vincent moved first, planting himself in front of her, blocking her path with silent, simmering anger.

A brittle sigh escaped her lips as her irritation edged into her voice. "Now what do,you want from me?"


He leaned in, eyes narrowing. "So you've been with Felix all this time?"


Truthfully, she had. The hormone-monitoring wristband design was at a critical phase-there couldn't be any room for error.


Meeting his glare head-on, Hannah didn't even blink."Yes. I was with him the whole time. Satisfied?"


Vincent's face clouded over, his jaw flexing as he tried to hold back something sharper. "Is this all just to rile me up?"


She frowned, completely thrown. "What are you even talking about?"


His frustration boiled over. "First, you accepted the bracelet he picked out for you. Then, you go out and buy him a suit. What's next, candlelit dinners? Aren't you just deliberately trying to make me jealous?Maybe try acting your age." He grabbed her wrist with a sudden, angry movement, turning it until the bracelet flashed in the light. "Do you have any idea what people are saying? The rumor mill thinks you've bagged yourself a new benefactor."
###Chapter 96 Jewelry

Vincent's tone dipped so low that it sent an icy tremor racing along Hannah's spine. So he had been aware of how people badmouthed and slandered her the whole time, accusing her of being a kept woman while she was his rightful wife, their marriage under wraps due to his demands. He'd known what she had been through but chosen to do nothing.


Until now, she had been convincing herself he was oblivious to the helI she'd faced, and that if he had heard, he would've stood up for her. How pathetic.


Hannah wrenched her hand free from Vincent's grasp, her stare frigid as it locked onto his. "When they accused me of clinging to you like some pathetic leech, calling you my benefactor, you stood by and said nothing, still keeping our marriage under your hat. But the moment Felix and I were seen in the same store and rumors flared up, your ego was bruised, and their opinions suddenly mattered?

You're unbelievable, Vincent."


Vincent's mouth tensed. "We're talking about Felix.Leave everything else out of it."


Hannah scoffed. It always came down to whatever he decided was worth mentioning. She spun around to ascend the stairs, her voice drained of emotion."Then we've got nothing to address."


He moved again, palms planted firmly on the polished handrail, cutting off her path. "You won't talk? Fine." He seized her wrist and pinned it to the wall, his thumb pressing against the links of the bracelet."Then remove this."



Hannah tried to jerk her hand away, her voice laced with fire. "Who gave you the authority to decide what I keep?"


As she struggled, the chain dug sharply into her skin,leaving a scrape behind. "You're hurting me."


Without hesitation, Vincent tore the clasp and hurled the bracelet to the floor. "There. Not anymore."
Hannah's breath caught. She bolted down the stairs and snatched the bracelet up like it was something saored-but it was already broken.


Vincent's brow furrowed at how flustered she looked.She was this emotional-over a gift from someone else?



"Have you lost your mind?" she hissed, her glare freezing. The rage had peaked. She'd barely worn the bracelet for a full day-just enough to start getting used to it.


"It's just a bracelet," he shot back, his voice frigid."Have I ever failed to afford you any jewelry?" His voice was taut with rage. "You're seriously throwing a fit over something that didn't even cost ten grand?"


Hannah said nothing, her icy gaze fixed on him.


Vincent let out a sigh. "Fine. Derek will deliver a whole collection tomorrow. Choose whatever to your liking."


His tone was indifferent, even condescending-like 
the bracelet he broke was worthless. Like what she felt meant nothing. It made her blood simmer. To him,everything had a price tag. Even she did.


Hannah tightened her fingers around the broken bracelet, her voice hollow. "Save it. I'm not accepting anything from you."


Vincent gave a dry chuckle. "Is that so? Funny. You used to flaunt every item I got you like they were royal heirlooms."


She barely reacted-because it wasn't a lie. Back when she loved him, every gift had meant everything.But after he broke her heart, she'd sold them all.Every last piece. Including the purple gemstone necklace identical to the one Brinley wore.


Hannah gave a faint smile. "Then your observation is lacking. I haven't worn anything from you for ages."


Vincent faltered, his gaze instinctively dropping to scan her outfit.



Hannah ignored him and grabbed her belongings,continuing up the steps. "If you're hellbent on compensating me for the broken bracelet, get the exact same one. Anything else, I couldn't care less about."


She brushed past and headed straight to the guest room.


Vincent's throat bobbed, his reply stuck as he watched her walk away. His chest rose and fell sharply, his breath uneven. She cared that much about a bracelet Felix gave her-enough to demand an identical replacement?


A cold snort left his nose. She'd really learned how to get under his skin. He stood motionless, lips flattened, thinking. Then, he went upstairs.


As soon as Vincent entered their bedroom, he began rifling through the drawers. He didn't buy her claim.Even if she hadn't worn the jewelry he gave her lately, she must've brought those pieces here.She had once treated them like treasure.


But no matter how much he searched, there was hardly a hint of her presence left in this room. Except for a few garments in the wardrobe, none of it belonged to her now. Especially not any jewelry.


His expression hardened.Hannah had drawn the line clearly. Once declaring she wouldn't live in this room anymore, she'd have removed almost every trace of herself.


Since there was no jewelry here, she must've taken those pieces to the guest room. He crossed the hallway in swift strides and flung open the guest door without bothering to knock. It wasn't locked.


Hannah wasn't in sight. The water running in the bathroom made it clear-she was showering.


Vincent glanced around. The setup looked temporary, like someone who had no intention of staying long.


He had meant to inspect the drawers, but something on the desk caught his attention-a large branded bag. He lifted it and peeked inside. A neatly folded indigo suit jacket lay within, complete with cufflinks and a matching tie.


In that instant, every trace of anger faded away. His eyes lit up, and a grin tugged at his lips. So, the suit wasn't for Felix. It had been meant for him.
###Chapter 97 Skiing
Guilt twisted in Vincent's chest, quick and sharp. An idea surfaced almost instantly. He thumbed out a message to Derek. "Book two ski passes for tomorrow. And line up a sports car-a nice one,something a woman would love."


Vincent had noted that Hannah had been driving that car for almost five years. It was crying out for an upgrade. A memory surfaced of his skipping dinner with her parents for Brinley-and he knew he still owed her for that. He didn't think much of it. He would just make it up to her all at once.


Across town, Derek was sprawled in bed, half-focused on a mobile game, when Vincent's message popped up. He sat bolt upright. He typed back immediately. "Understood."


Rolling out of bed, Derek got to work, shaking his head with a crooked smile. Who was Vincent trying to impress this time?


Without missing a beat, he told Clive to push back every meeting set for the next day, freeing Vincent's calendar. Clive responded just as quickly.


Meanwhile, Vincent found his gaze lingering over the suit jacket, appreciation deepening as he traced the fine stitching. Hannah truly had an eye for style.


He was still lost in admiration when the bathroom door swung open without warning. He quickly set the jacket back in its place.


Hannah emerged, wrapped in nothing but a towel.At the sight of Vincent standing in her room, her expression tightened. "Why are you in here?" She tugged on a loose T-shirt, deliberately turning her back as she pulled it over her head.


Vincent closed the distance between them, his voice soft. "Do you have anything planned for tonight?"


He reached out, attempting to tuck a damp strand of hair behind her ear.

She immediately batted his hand away. "If you have nothing better to do, get out."


His hand dropped to his side, awkward and uncertain. She was still angry-understandably so.After all, she'd made the effort to pick out a gift for him, only for him to jump to conclusions and accuse her of things she hadn't done. Anyone in her position would be furious. Especially since she'd cared about him more than anything.


Trying to ease the tension, Vincent said, his voice gentler now, "I had Derek get us two ski tickets for tomorrow. You're available tomorrow, right?"


Hannah eyed him warily and stepped back, suspicion etched across her features. "Skiing? Why the sudden urge?"


Moments ago, they'd been locked in a heated argument. Now, with a flick of his tone, he was tossing out a ski trip invitation as if nothing had happened. She genuinely couldn't make sense of what was running through his mind.
Vincent offered a half-hearted explanation. "You've been run ragged organizing, my grandma's birthday.Figured you might want a break. Somewhere overseas."



What he kept to himself was that their constant bickering had worn them both thin, and after she'd gone out of her way to buy him a suit as a gift, maybe this trip could be their way back to each other. But Hannah's expression stayed stubbornly cool, not even a flicker of emotion breaking through.


"I've got things to do," Hannah replied, her tone flat as glass.



Vincent's expression shifted. "You don't want to go?"


She didn't hesitate. "Yeah. Skiing's boring."


His features hardened, a chill settling over him.They'd never even had a proper wedding-just a rushed honeymoon, holed up in a villa under Evrellia's towering, snow-draped mountains.


He still remembered that back then, they'd spent endless days watching flurries drift past the windows. Whenever the storm clouds finally cleared,she would slip her hand into his and coax him outside, her eyes bright with anticipation, eager for them to carve fresh trails across the untouched slopes. She'd once swore skiing was her greatest joy.But now she dismissed it, as if those memories meant nothing at all.


His breath snagged, but he forced his tone to remain steady. "The tickets are booked. Non-refundable."


A brittle laugh slipped from Hannah's lips. "Since when do you care about a couple of nonrefundable tickets?" Her gaze cut through him, glacial and unyielding."Why not take Brinley with you? She'd jump at the chance to hit the slopes with you. I'm not here to play games."


Vincent's jaw tensed, half his face swallowed by shadow. "I'm not negotiating with you."


Hannah lifted a brow, her cold smile icy and detached. "And I've already said no." Her voice dripped with contempt. "Are you going to force me again?"

###Chapter 98 A Box Of Birth Control Pills
With a heavy sigh, Vincent undid the top buttons of his shirt, trying to relieve the tension he felt. "So much has gone on lately," he muttered. "We haven't really talked things through in weeks. Maybe a ski trip would give us a chance to catch our breath-just the two of us, without any interruptions."


He quickly added, "But if you're not up for skiing, we can stay indoors at the villa there. Whatever you prefer."


The tension on Hannah's expression eased a bit.Vincent had a point. They'd been fighting nonstop,and every time she brought up divorce, he'd always brushed it aside as if she were just being dramatic.Perhaps it was time for a serious conversation to end their marriage.


If going on this ski trip meant escaping the Jones estate and finally having a chance to mention the divorce agreement Vincent had signed without realizing it, she'd take it. If he wanted any term to be changed, they could sort it all out at once.


Hannah relented. "What time are we leaving tomorrow?"


For the first time that night, the tension had finally faded from Vincent's face. "I'll text you the details soon."



Hannah nodded quietly. "I have something important to discuss with you tomorrow."


He paused, eyes flickering to the shopping bag on the desk, a small spark of hope igniting. He looked back at her, a new seriousness in his voice. "You can tell me now,if you want."


She shook her head. "Not tonight. I'm exhausted.Tomorrow."


"All right," he replied. "Just promise you won't forget." She shot him a look. "Aren't you going to leave?"


"Sleep tight," he said gently.


With that, Vincent walked out, and Hannah locked the door behind him.


An hour later, Vincent's message appeared on her phone. "Leaving at ten tomorrow. The private jet will be waiting in the courtyard."


She typed a brief "OK" in reply.


As she turned off for the night, sleep stayed out of reach, no matter how hard she tried. Whether it was anxiety or just the weight on her mind, she kept tossing and turning in bed.


Finally, she got up and rummaged through her drawer,hunting for some melatonin.


In her search, she nearly grabbed her birth control pills by mistake before finally finding what she needed. Without thinking, she set the birth control pills aside on her nightstand and then took two melatonin tablets. Only after that did her body finally relax enough to drift off.


The following morning, Hannah woke up later than usual. As she made her way toward the stairs, she heard Brinley shouting from the dining room. "You're going skiing with Hannah?"


Hannah frowned. Always so loud. So annoying.


During the breakfast, Brinley had just learned that Vincent had taken a day off. She'd been about to ask what his plans were-only to hear that he was going skiing with Hannah.


A wave of jealousy rushed through Brinley. She couldn't resist asking, "It's just going to be the two of you?"


Vincent, unfazed, replied with a simple "Yeah," his gaze flickering to the top of the stairs.


Sharon beamed with approval, "It's about time you took Hannah out for some fun."



Danica exchanged a glance with Brinley and then tried to keep her tone light. "Vincent, you know,
Brinley hasn't had a chance to get out much lately.Maybe she could tag along with you and Hannah?"


Sharon shot her an irritated look. "They're a married couple going on a trip together. How could Brinley tag along?"


Vincent said nothing.


With Sharon's disapproval clear,.Brinley had no choice but to smile through gritted teeth."I appreciate the thought, Mrs. Jones, but it really wouldn't be appropriate for me to tag along when Vincent and HHannah are going together as an item.That said, it has been a while since I last went skiing."


Her words faded away, eyes glistening with disappointment she'd deliberately let through.


Vincent's expression softened a touch. "If you really want to go skiing, I'll have Derek arrange a trip for you in a few days."


Brinley's head shot up, hope flickering in her gaze."Will you come with me?"
"| won't," Vincent answered. "My schedule's packed afterward. A lot is coming up."


He'd cleared his entire schedule to make room for a three-month break-this one day was already a luxury he had to fight to get.


Brinley felt a pang of disappointment. So this little trip was meant just for Hannah-something Vincent had set aside for Hannah alone. But weren't they still in a cold war? Did that mean they'd patched things up already?


Brinley looked down, trying to hide the frustration swirling in her eyes. "If you're not going, then what's the point?"


An uneasy silence settled over the table.


Danica started to interject but froze when Sharon shot her a firm gaze.


Turning her focus to Vincent, Sharon's tone grew serious. "Remember, Hannah doesn't handle the cold well.Pack extra layers for her."
Vincent let out a light laugh, still in high spirits. "It's just a quick trip, Grandma. We'll be fine."


"Quick trip or not, make sure she stays warm,"Sharon insisted.


Vincent smiled, reassuring as ever. "Don't fret. I'll look after her."


"I'm more worried you'll hurt her feelings again,"Sharon murmured under her breath, though she didn't say anything anymore. She'd seen enough to know how often Hannah was upset because of Vincent.


A flicker of discomfort crossed Vincent's face,making it clear he didn't want to linger on the conversation. "I'll go check on Hannah."


Brinley kept her head down, absently poking at her food.


Vincent climbed the stairs and paused outside the guest room.He tried to twist the handle. Locked. He rapped on the door. "Come on. Open up."

His knocking came fast and loud, enough to get on Hannah's nerves.



Annoyed, Hannah swung the door open, only to see Vincent waiting outside, a smile playing on his lips.


"What do you want?" she asked, her tone flat.


Vincent stepped inside without waiting for an invitation. "We're leaving soon.Are you packed?"


Hannah let out a tired breath. "Not yet. I haven't even washed my face."


Her morning had been spent going over Nova Tech's product updates with Felix and requesting the day off.



Vincent checked his watch. "No rush. You've got thirty minutes. Once you're ready, we'll go."


"Alright," Hannah muttered, rubbing her eyes and heading for the bathroom.


While she was gone, Vincent started gathering her things, tossing her skincare products into her bag-she couldn't use just anything with her sensitive skin.


As he zipped up the pouch, his eyes landed on a small botte left out on the nightstand.


He picked it up, and a chill ran through him as he realized what it was. Birth control? She was taking birth control?

###Chapter 99 You Really Want Another Woman To Have My Child
Hannah emerged from the bathroom,toweling off her damp hair, and found Vincent rooted to the spot. One of her bags had toppled over by his feet, but she barely glanced at him as she scooped it up. She realized he'd already packed away her skincare, so she quickly tossed in a few more essentials.


"We're good to go. Come on," Hannah said breezily.


Vincent remained motionless, his jaw clenched,icy eyes fixed on her.


Only now did Hannah register the stony tension in his face. She paused, brows knitting. "What's wrong?"


A dry, almost bitter laugh escaped Vincent. "What's wrong?" he repeated, his voice simmering with barely concealed anger. "You really don't know?"


Hannah's eyes narrowed, all patience gone. "If you've got something to say, just say it. I'm not interested in playing mind games right now."


His voice turned rough, barely controlled. "You're really going to act clueless? If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, would you have kept pretending nothing was going on?"


A sharp current ran through the room. Hannah's pulse skipped-had he found the divorce agreement?But she quickly steadied herself. Well, it was better that way. They wouldn't have to wait until the ski trip to talk. They could deal with it here and now.


Her tone stayed even, measured. "I wasn't trying to keep it from you."


He shot her a look of disbelief. "Not trying to keep it?" His laugh was cold and sharp. "You knew exactly what you were doing."


Vincent clenched his jaw, anger flickering in his eyes.They'd agreed to start a family-mostly for his grandmother, who kept hinting about a great-grandchild. But now, the truth hit him like a punch to the gut: Hannah had been quietly taking birth control all along.


"I acknowledge that I should've just told you about it sooner," Hannah replied, her voice steady, almost detached. "If you're on board, let's just get the divorce finalized."


He suddenly stepped in, looming over her with a stormy expression. "So that's it? You're popping pills behind my back because you want a divorce?"


She went utterly still. Pills? Her eyes flicked to his hand, her pulse skipping-he was clutching her birth control pills. She met his gaze, chin lifted."Yeah."


A fresh wave of anger surged through Vincent.He seized her wrist, his grip iron-tight. "When did you start taking them?"


"Just two days back." She jerked her arm free and backed away, forcing distance between them.


Vincent blinked. Just two day/s back, immediately after he'd taken her by force. His mind reeled.
 Suddenly, all those years without a child came rushing back, sharper than ever. His grandmother had long assumed it was a fertility problem, even going so far as to urge them to get checked. But now the truth crashed downon him-it had been her, all along. She'd been taking birth control the entire time.


He let out a cold, mocking laugh. "Two days back?Haven't you been taking the pills all this time? No wonder we've gone five years without a kid."


Hannah's breath caught in her throat. Her nails pressed so hard into her palm that they nearly broke skin. This was what it all came down to? A bottle of pills, and suddenly, he decided the blame for their childless marriage belonged solely to her.


A dull ache radiated through her chest, sharper than any argument. Unbidden, the memory of that tiny life she'd lost-gone barely a month in-flashed behind her eyes. She swallowed her pain and managed a brittle laugh. "You don't have the right to talk about children." He hadn't even known his own child had once existed. And he sure as hell didn't deserve to be a father now.


"I don't have the right?" His voice was rough, the words clipped with fury. A vein pulsed visibly at his temple as he let out a cold, hollow laugh. "I'm your husbànd. Who could possibly be more entitled than me?"


Disappointment flickered in his eyes, sharp as glass."You know how much Grandma cherished you. After everything, isn't it the least you can do? All she's ever dreamed of is seeing her great-grandchild."


Hannah stood silent for a heartbeat, wrestling with the truth of his words. If she owed anyone in the Jones family, it was Sharon. But what stung most wasn't the thought of failing to produce a child-it was knowing she'd denied Sharon the chance to keep her as a granddaughter-in-law. None of this was ever about the child. They were already on the verge of divorce-there was no sense dragging a baby into the wreckage of their marriage.


Hannah met his gaze with steady resolve. "So what?

Isn't that all she wants anyway-a great-grandchild?
If I can't give her one, let Brinley do it. She'd probably jump at the chance to carry on the Jones family name."



She tossed out the words like they meant nothing,her tone so casual that it cut straight through him.


Vincent's eyes flashed, a burning intensity in his stare that threatened to scorch everything in its path.She just kept pushing him toward another woman,over and over, treating him as if he were something disposable-an afterthought to be handed off without a second glance. Her coldness pressed in on him,suffocating.


His voice dropped to a rough, throaty whisper. "You really want another woman to have my child?"

###Chapter 100 Was He Really Going To Marry Brinley

"Why not? We're getting divorced anyway," Hannah remarked coldly as she crossed her arms.


Vincent had lost track of how many times she'd brought up ending things. An ache settled somewhere deep as he asked, "So you're dead set on divorcing me?"


No hesitation met his question. "Absolutely," Hannah answered, cold and unwavering.


Their eyes locked. Hannah was the first to look away.


Coldness slipped into Vincent's tone. "Are you sure you can actually handle life without me?" It was barely a question. He remembered clearly how, from the day they met, she'd always found a reason to be near him. He doubted she would actually walk away.


"I don't need you, Vincent. No one's irreplaceable,Hannah said,her voice steady as she raised her chin."I'll be better off without you,"


That declaration left him stunned and silent. Did she truly believe she'd be happier on her own? A hard glint came into his gaze. "Don't you ever take those birth control pills behind my back again. And as for this divorce idea-drop it."



Finality echoed in his voice, dismissing her request for a divorce entirely.


Hannah's frown deepened, her gaze holding steady.With measured determination, she said, "I mean it,Vincent. I really want a divorce."


Annoyance crept into his expression. "Unless you want me to tell my grandma about you taking those pills, I suggest you shut your mouth."


Hannah raised an eyebrow. "You won't tell her." Both of them cared about Sharon's condition too much to say anything to sour her mood and potentially cause her to faint from emotional distress.
 Leveling her tone, Hannah added, "Seriously, think about getting a divorce. I've made up my mind."


Watching Hannah's unwavering resolve made Vincent's temper spike. Ignoring her last remark, he spun around, yanked open the door, and leaned out over the railing. "Brinley!" he called out.


Downstairs, Brinley and Danica exchanged a quick,puzzled look. Neither had any idea what had just happened. Without wasting a moment, the two of them made their way up the stairs at a brisk pace.


With a cautious step, Brinley stopped at the landing."Is everything okay, Vincent? Did something happen?"


Vincent shot her a glance. "Didn't you want to go skiing? Get your things-we're leaving now."


Delight flashed in Danica's eyes. She tugged on Brinley's sleeve, unable to contain herself. "He's taking you, finally! What are you waiting for?"


Brinley tamped down her joy and said gently, still playing the thoughtful charade, "Vincent, perhaps I should pass. Your grandmother was right. I'd only be intruding on your time with Hannah."



"Only you and I are going," Vincent said flatly, his gaze never wavering from Hannah.


Both Brinley and Danica turned, eyes landing on Hannah for her reaction. Had Hannah and Vincent just gotten into an argument?


Barely reacting, Hannah quietly unpacked her bag,removing her belongings one by one. A calm farewell slipped from her lips. "Hope you both have a great time."



With that, she planted her hand on Vincent's shoulder and pushed him out the door. A loud bang followed as she slammed it shut behind him.



Annoyance simmered in Danica's expression. Who did Hannah think she was, treating Vincent so coldly?Hannah's behavior had grown more and more outrageous lately.
Every instinct told Danica to speak up, but she swallowed her irritation, remembering Vincent's decision to take Brinley for the skiing trip. The last thing she wanted was to see him take Hannah's side again, So, she forced a sweet smile and faced Vincent and Brinley. "Go on and enjoy yourselves.Have a wonderful time."



Delight shone in Brinley's eyes. "Thank you, Mrs.Jones."



With purposeful strides, Vincent set the pace, forcing Brinley to hurry just to keep up.


Already prepared, the private jet waited on the tarmac. Derek appeared and greeted Vincent with polished professionalism, his eyes lingering for just a second on Brinley walking close behind Vincent. A hint of surprise flickered across his face. Word on the grapevine might actually be true-was Vincent really going to marry Brinley?


Derek masked his curiosity, keeping his expression even as he escorted them aboard.
...


Free time stretched before Hannah, leaving her momentarily aimless. Work obligations were on hold for the day, and the last details of the birthday party preparation were now in the hands of event staff.


When her eyes landed on the shopping bag she brought back yesterday, an idea came to her.Delivering it to Miles at Sterling Heights sounded like a good way to spend her afternoon.


She scribbled a quick note, slipped it into the bag,and grabbed the bag on her way out.


Descending the stairs, she noted Danica leisurely sipping her coffee and wearing an air of contentment.


Danica looked pleased with herself. The instant her eyes landed on Hannah, she figured Hannah was full of regret for her earlier behavior and had come to chase after Vincent. With a smug smile, she said,"You're too late to chase them now. Brinley and Vincent left some time ago. There's no way you'll catch up."


A split-second pause was all it took for Hannah to catch Danica's meaning. No argument left her lips.Instead, she played along with a sly grin. "Maybe you're right. Maybe I should just fly directly to the ski resort and wait for Vincent there."


The suggestion sent Danica into a panic. "Hannah,don't do anything reckless!"


Laughter bubbled from Hannah, but she offered no further reply, heading straight out to her car.


No sooner had Hannah's car disappeared than Danica fired off a frantic message to Brinley."Hannah's had a change of heart-she's coming for Vincent!"
###Chapter 101 His Inexplicable Hostility
At Sterling Heights, Hannah headed toward Unit 2301 without delay.

Her initial intention had been to simply drop the garment off and walk away. However, just as she lowered the bag, the elevator chimed behind her, and out walked Miles,accompanied by his assistant.

Hannah stiffened.

The moment Miles caught sight of her, his face darkened. He instantly recognized her as the same one who'd previously offered him five percent in profits.

Kenneth had already dug into Nova Tech. This company hadn't even managed to clear a seven-figure revenue in years. Her offer seemed ridiculous.

Miles cast Hannah a disdainful look. "You again?" His gaze dropped, landing on the bag Hannah had placed by the door."Trying to buy my favor?"

Frantically, Hannah raised her arms. "Mr. Whitaker, it's not what you're thinking." She picked up the bag and extended it to him."This suit jacket is for you. I lost the one you lent me and bought the same design to make up forit."

Miles made no move to take it. His voice was sharp."Unnecessary. I don't wear things from other people."Especially not from someone who'd done everything she could to get into his orbit.
Hannah could feel the rejection in his stare. She calmly drew her hand back and placed it down again by the door once more."I understand your decision," she said evenly. "Still, returning it feels like the right thing to do."

Without further words, she turned on her heel and headed toward the elevator.

But before she could step in, Miles called out,"Ms. Scott."

She turned her head. "Yes, Mr. Whitaker?"

"If you have that much drive to run after me, maybe channel it into your company products." Miles' gaze was cold and appraising. "From what I hear, you've got nothing new coming.Looks like collapse is near."

Hannah paused, puzzled by the level of hostility he harbored toward her. He always painted her as deceitful, always presumed the worst. She gave a distant smile. "No need to worry, Mr. Whitaker. Nova Tech isn't going under."

She wasn't in the mood to continue this conversation. With the elevator still not there, she made her way down the stairs instead.

Miles gave a curt laugh. "So she does have a temper."

Miles appreciated strength and guts, but this woman's tactics felt so cheap. He had no patience for women who tried to latch on him.

Kenneth glanced down at the bag resting by the door. Inside was a richly-colored indigo blazer and a note folded neatly inside. He didn't bother to read it. It likely contained a phone number or some personal detail. Knowing how much Miles loathed these gestures, he didn't say a word about it. "What should I do with the blazer, Mr. Whitaker?" Kenneth asked.

"Toss it," Miles said without hesitation.



Moments like this were rare-Hannah finally got to relax at her Sterling Heights apartment. No one to argue with. No tension in the air. The last few days with Vincent had been draining-heated arguments and frigid silences. Her emotions had been stretched thin. She couldn't remember the last time she felt peace like this.

She found herself quietly longing for the day their divorce would be settled, for this space to become her new home.

She leaned back and closed her eyes, hoping to rest,but her mind was restless. Vincent's sharp remarks kept looping in her memory, followed by the image of Miles's disdain. Her thoughts wouldn't quiet down.

She glanced at the clock. It was only three in the afternoon.After a brief moment of thought, she chose to return to the office. Nova Tech still needed her.

On the way,Hannah picked up a tray of coffee for the team.

Felix looked up as she entered. "Didn't you go skiing?" he asked in a hushed voice. "You're back already?"

Hannah distributed the cups with ease while responding to him in a low voice, "Didn't happen. Vincent brought Brinley instead."Felix shook his head, clearly indignant on her behalf. "What a jerk."

She gently patted his arm and then addressed her colleagues. She gently patted his arm and then addressed her colleagues,"Take whatever you'd like."

With that, she made her way back to her office and buried herself in her tasks.

Elsewhere, Brinley was glowing with excitement asshe pulled on her ski clothes. "Vincent! I'm all set! When are we heading out?"

"Soon," he replied. He was sitting on the couch, shoulders tense, eyes glued to his tablet.

From their departure on the private jet to their arrival at the villa, he hadn't taken a break. His brow was drawn tight as he focused on the screen.

Brinley noticed his shift in mood. Danica's earlier message flashed through her thoughts. Could it be true? Had Hannah really fotlowed them here? A wave of unease rippled through her. This wasn't where she wanted to run into Hannah-not in a romantic setting like this. She approached him carefully."Vincent, is something wrong?"

He locked the tablet. "I need to head back."
###Chapter 102 Is This How You Treat Your Wife

A sudden stillness replaced Brinley's bright expression. "Vincent,I just got changed for skiing-and now you're leaving already?"Her eyes were wide with disbelief.

Not bothering to meet her gaze, Vincent stood, briskly buttoning his jacket. He motioned to the waiting butler with a tilt of his head.

Picking up on the silent cue, the butler quickly slipped away to handle the jet preparations.

Apologies sounded hollow as Vincent checked his watch. "An urgent matter came up at the office. Everything's arranged for you-the butler will make sure you're all set. Go ahead and ski without me."

Desperation crept in as Brinley moved to catch his wrist,her voice soft and sweet. "It's no fun alone. Can't you just push it back for a while? We hardly ever get moments like this together."

A glimmer of hope shone in her eyes, silently hoping he'd change his mind for her.

Without hesitation, Vincent freed his arm from her grasp and stepped away. "This can't wait." He made it clear he wouldn't budge.

Shoulders drooping, Brinley gave in. "Fine..."

With his back turned, Vincent walked to the enormous window and stared out at the swirling snow, his thoughts miles away.

Long moments passed before Brinley made up her mind and  Long moments passed before Brinley made up her mind and spoke up. "In that case, I'll head back with you."

"No need. Stay and enjoy yourself. Take a few more days here,"he said flatly, still facing the window.

Brinley did her best to keep her voice gentle, even as disappointment crept in. "It isn't much of a vacation without you,but I get it-work is important."

"Do whatever you want," Vincent replied, his voice detached.

Resolved to leave, she murmured, "I'll go change, then."

Her ski clothes were swapped for travel attire in record time,and she reappeared, frustration clear in her movements as she packed up her belongings.

Soon after,both Vincent and Brinley boarded the jet together and began the trip back.

By 7 p.m., they were back at the Jones estate.

No sooner had they entered the main hall than a flurry of criticism descended on them.

Danica gave Brinley a discreet look.

Sharon's expression turned thunderous the instant Vincent walked in with Brinley. She shot up from the sofa. "Where's Hannah? Weren't you supposed to take your wife skiing?"

Silence stretched from Vincent, his jaw tight.

Trying to smooth things over, Brinley quickly stepped up and reached out to steady Sharon. "Please, Sharon, don't get upset -it's not good for your health."

Dismissively, Sharon shook off Brinley's hand and leveled a finger at Vincent. "Is this how you treat your wife? You promised to take her, yet you brought Brinley instead? If you're through with her, just admit it and I'll arrange the divorce  through with her, just admit it and I'll arrange the divorce
myself!"

A flush of anger spread over her cheeks, and in the end, she had to sit down on the sofa, unable to keep standing.

Vincent's voice sounded strained and low. "Grandma, it's not what you think."

No patience lingered in Sharon's tone. "Don't feed me excuses.Then tell me-why didn't you come back with Hannah?"

Avoiding the question, Vincent's gaze flicked upstairs,a worried crease forming on his brow. "She's not home yet?"

Sharon's eyes narrowed as she shot Brinley a cold side-eye."You went on a trip with another woman. What reason would Hannah have to come back?"

A wave of anxiety swept over Brinley at the bite in Sharon's words-each one seemed to single her out.

Without lingering a moment longer, Vincent spun around. "I'll go look for her."

Some of Sharon's fire faded. "That's not necessary. I already called. She said she'll be back soon."

Only then did Vincent pivot, approaching the sofa to sit beside his grandmother.

Realization dawned on Brinley as she glanced at Vincent. He hadn't come back because of work at all-he'd only rushed home for Hannah. A cold ache settled over her, heavy with bitterness. Resentment took root, her thoughts darkening toward Hannah.

Watching the change in Brinley's demeanor, Danica reached over and gave her shoulder a gentle, understanding pat.

Before Danica could offer a word of comfort, the front door Before Danica could offer a word of comfort, the front door swung open. Hannah walked in, her presence filling the foyer.

Originally,Hannah hadn't planned to return to the Jones estate tonight, but Sharon's call changed everything. Word had reached Sharon, courtesy of Aubrey, that she hadn't gone skiing, and that news had instantly set Sharon on edge.

Worry had gotten the best of Sharon, who'd pleaded with Hannah to come home, afraid Hannah might be nursing hurt feelings somewhere alone.

Truthfully, Hannah hadn't felt all that wounded. Reluctance to return faded as she thought of Sharon's concern, so she agreed to come back.

Crossing the threshold, Hannah's gaze landed first on Vincent and then on Brinley. Apparently, their grand ski adventure was over sooner than expected. Barely sparing them a second look,she walked ahead, her mind elsewhere.

Arms wide, Sharon greeted her with warmth. "Hannah,you're finally here. We were all waiting for you so we could start dinner."

A smile broke across Hannah's face as she hurried to Sharon's side,lending support.

Vincent gazed at Hannah. In a flash, he was on his feet and reaching for her arm. "Grandma, I need a moment alone with Hannah."

Defiance flashed in Hannah's eyes. "Vincent, let go."

Resistance didn't matter. Vincent pulled Hannah away, intent on a private conversation.

At the edge of the room, Brinley started to follow, instinct guiding her steps, but Sharon's cane came down,blocking her path. "Let them handle their own problems. Why are you chasing after them? You stay right here." The words rang out chasing after them? You stay right here." The words rang out sharp and final.

Redness filled Brinley's eyes. "I just need some fresh air."Without waiting for permission, she turned and slipped out,the weight of the evening pressing down on her shoulders.
###Chapter 103 Don't Take Those Pills Again
Out in the garden, Hannah jerked her hand from Vincent's grasp,her annoyance unmistakable. "What do you want now?"she snapped.

Vincent eased her down onto the swing, crouching so his eyes met hers, earnest and somber. "What happened this morning -that was on me."

She shot him a cold look and moved to stand.′′|that all? Then I'm going."

He reached out, grabbing her by the arm and gently guiding her back onto the swing. "But you shouldn't be taking those birth control pills. Don't you realize how rough they are on your health?"

A scowl flickered across Hannah's face. Her words came out edged and brittle. "You think I wanted to? If you hadn't forced yourself on me, I wouldn't have needed them."

Vincent stiffened, struck silent as conflicting emotions churned behind his eyes. "If you don't want a baby right now, just say so,"he murmured, keeping his tone low but steady. "We can use protection. Just... Don't take those pills again, okay? I'll talk to Grandma.I promise."

Hannah said nothing. There was no future for them-just four more days, and it would all be over.

Vincent hovered too close, his steady breath ghosting across her cheek, leaving her more trapped than reassured. She pushed him back, voice clipped. "Don't come near me."

He brushed off the rejection, convinced she was just brooding  He brushed off the rejection, convinced she was just brooding over this morning's argument. Rising, he absently twisted the wedding band on his finger and then tried to change the subject. "With my grandma's birthday banquet around the corner,why not invite your parents to stay a bit?"

His tone was unusually earnest. "I didn't meet them last time.I'd like to make it up to you-and to them."

Hannah rejected the idea immediately. "That's not necessary."With divorce hanging over them, she couldn't bear the thought of her parents meeting with Vincent.

Annoyance flickered across his face. "Why not? Grandma would be over the moon if your parents joined us for her birthday."

Hannah didn't bother explaining. She stared at their shadowS pooled on the pavement, her voice flat. "It's too much trouble."

Vincent wouldn't let it go, his gaze locked on her. "I'll have someone bring them here."

She declined, tone clipped. "Don't."

A short distance away, a silhouette hesitated beneath the trees.

Brinley had followed the sound of their voices and arrived just in time to overhear Vincent's offer. Her fingers curled into tight fists, resentment simmering beneath her cool exterior.Worried that Sharon mnight question where she'd gone, she quietly slipped away.

Vincent's eyes narrowed stubbornly. "What if I insist on bringing them over?"

A weary,mocking smile flickered across Hannah's lips."Vincent,what exactly are you trying to accomplish? Last time my parents tried to reach out, you brushed them off. Now, out of nowhere, you're so eager to play the dutiful son-in-law?"

She pushed herself up from the swing, brushing dust from  her She pushed herself up from the swing, brushing dust from her skirt as she did. "They've skipped Sharon's birthday every single year. What's the point in dragging them into this now?"

Vincent faltered, throat working as he searched for an answer that wouldn't come.
a
Without waiting for him, Hannah started to walk away. "Quit acting like you care."

She barely made it three steps before Vincent's hand closed around her wrist,halting her escape. "It was Grandma's request,"he blurted, voice strained, clinging to Sharon's name like a lifeline.

Hannah jerked against his grip but failed, her glare icy."Then I'll tell Sharon my parents won't be coming."

Vincent's tone gentled, a plea tucked into every syllable."She'll be crushed if they don't show up. Is that really what you want-for her seventieth birthday to feel like just another disappointment?"

For a long moment, Hannah didn't answer. It was obvious the previous rift had left a deep mark on Sharon.

Vincent shifted, his voice careful. "Your parents-they've always wanted a chance to meet me, you know."

A sharp,joyless laugh slipped from Hannah. "So you've known this whole time." He'd spent eight years sidestepping them,perfectly aware, yet never once making the effort. The sheer irony was almost laughable. Still, forSharon's sake, she figured she owed her parents at least the courtesy of asking their opinion.

After a long silence, Hannah gave in, her tone weary. "Fine. I'll think about it. But for now, let me go."

Vincent looked like he wanted to say something, but the words never left his lips. He finally released her wrist. Without another glance, Hannah strode out of the garden,leaving him standing alone.
###Chapter 104 The Hospital Report
Dinner that evening settled into a heavy silence.

Hannah barely touched her meal before quietly excusing herself and retreating upstairs.

Vincent watched her go and then broke the hush with a measured announcement. "Grandma, your birthday party's coming up. Hannah and I plan to invite her parents over to stay for a few days." He added, his tone pointed. "I told her it was your suggestion."

Sharon caught on instantly-this was a reminder to keep her story straight. She arched a brow at him, but let her features soften into an easy smile. "Honestly, you should've invited them long ago. Better late than never."

Brinley, having already overheard this arrangement, stabbed her steak with simmering resentment, saying nothing.

At the end of the table, Danica's expression soured. "What for?Didn't they already have lunch with us once?"

Sharon's eyes flashed with warning as she stated, "It's my birthday. I decide who's invited."

Danica knew Sharon wouldn't take kindly to opposition, but she still voiced her objection. "This is supposed to be a grand event. The guest list will be full of business leaders. If you bring in some schoolteachers from the countryside, it'll make us look ridiculous."

Danica couldn't object to Sharon's extending the invitation to her old friends, yet the idea of anyone in their circle seeing Hannah's parents at such an elite banquet made her squirm. Sharon's jaw tightened. Her cutlery crashed against her plate."They're my granddaughter-in-law's parents. You really think that's embarrassing?" she retorted sharply.

"But..." Danica tried to protest, but Vincent's icy voice sliced through the tension. "Mom, don't ever talk like that again."

Danica's face crumpled as she responded, "I do everything for this family's reputation, and somehow I'm the villain. I'm not wrong-they're just ordinary teachers from some backwater town. They can't possibly measure up to us."

Tears streaked down Danica's cheeks as she sniffled miserably.Sharon, thoroughly exasperated, snatched up her cane and stormed out.

Vincent shot Danica a look of disappointment before heading upstairs,leaving her alone with her wounded pride.

Brinley lingered at the dining table, quietly soothing Danica.

To Danica, Brinley seemed like her only true ally. Leaning in,she made a silent vow. "Don't worry, Brinley," she murmured."At the birthday banquet, I'll announce your engagement to Vincent for everyone to hear. Even if Hannah's parents show up, they'll only embarrass themselves."

A flash of malice flickered in Brinley's eyes, sharpening her features for a heartbeat. Whether Hannah's parents could really show up-that was another matter entirely.

Upstairs, in the guest room, Hannah dialed her parents. She explained that the Jones family had invited them to Sharon's birthday banquet, and her parents sounded genuinely delighted.

Raymond sought confirmation, a trace of hope in his voice."11|Vincent coming with you to pick us up?"

"He′5tied up with work," Hannah said lightly. She wanted to pick up her parents on her own. "I'll come get you myself." A beat of silence followed on the other end of the line.

Hannah caught the faint edge of disappointment in their voices and hurriedly added, "I'll see you at the train station tomorrow afternoon."

Margaret took the phone, her voice brisk and upbeat. "Alright,alright. We'll bring a few hometown treats along."

Hannah's lips curved into a soft smile. "You really don't need to go to any trouble."

"Nonsense! This is thefirst time the Jones family's invited us to something so important. Maybe they're finally starting to see your worth,Hannah."

"Maybe," Hannah said vaguely.

Margaret's tone softened, threaded with old worries. "That's all we ever hoped for. Your father and I just want to know you're happy there."

Hannah hesitated for a beat before answering, "I'm alright,Mom.Honestly, you don't have to worry about me."

They lingered in gentle conversation for a few more minutes before saying their goodbyes.



After soothing Danica's nerves, Brinley slipped away to her bedroom,the mask of gentleness slipping off the moment the door clicked shut.

Hatred and jealousy churned inside her every time she thought of Hannah. She couldn't stomach the thought of letting things lie, so she quietly put someone on Hannah's trail, determined to dig up anything dirty. There had to be a weakness-something she could exploit.

The task was taken sooner than expected. All evening, Brinley The task was taken sooner than expected. All evening, Brinley kept checking her phone, heart thudding, nerves wired tight.

It wasn't until deep into the night that her phone finally lit up with a notification. She fumbled it open at once, hands trembling with anticipation.
0
An image loaded-a scan of a hospital report. Hannah had suffered a miscarriage two years ago.

Shock hit Brinley like a jolt of electricity. She gripped her phone so hard that her knuckles turned white, mind already racing to twist this discovery into her sharpest weapon yet.
###Chapter 105 Car Accident

The following morning, Hannah arrived at the office to a charged, expectant buzz.

Nova Tech's latest invention-a hormone-tracking wristband-had just reached the prototype phase, and Hannah was determined to be the first to strap it on. If there was a flaw or a hiccup in the design, she wanted to catch it herself.

Boxes of glossy, futuristic wristbands made their way around the department, and every woman eagerly unboxed one,laughter and speculation swirling through the open-plan workspace.

Felix,riding the wave of excitement, flashed a triumphant smile as he declared lunch was on him for the R&D team.

With a grin, Felix turned to Hannah and asked, "What are you in the mood for?"

Hannah shook her head with a light, apologetic smile. "I'll have to pass-I've got somewhere to be this afternoon."

Felix's grin faltered as he closed the gap between them,dropping his voice in concern. "Is everything alright? Want me to help out with anything?"

She brushed off his worry with an easy shrug.′′No need. I'm just picking up my parents."

With a quick check of the time, she uttered a few parting words to her teammates and slipped out. Vincent had arranged for Derek to fetch her parents, while she asked Derek to meet her at Silvercrest Mall.

Meanwhile, at the Jones Group headquarters, Brinley sat across from Vincent, poring over Polaris Tech's latest product  from Vincent, poring over Polaris Tech's latest product proposal.

Her complexion was ashen, her voice barely above a whisper,but Vincent barely registered her discomfort-his gaze flicked repeatedly to his watch, his mind clearly elsewhere.
Δ
Brinley caught every flicker of impatience.

When the clock struck one, Vincent rose from his seat, already half-turned toward the door.

Seizing the moment, Brinley pressed a trembling hand to her chest and gasped, her tone laced with distress,′′Vncent,--don't feel well."

He spun around instantly. Spotting her clutching her chest, his face tightened with alarm-he immediately assumed she was suffering another heart problem. Frantically, he checked her purse and pockets for medication, but came up empty.

Panic overtook him as he swept her into his arms and raced for the hospital, his heart pounding in his throat.

He always believed she'd pull through, just like every other time-but when the medical team wheeled her straight into the ICU,a savage ache twisted deep inside Vincent's chest.

Suddenly,he was transported back to that harrowing afternoon when Brinley's father and brother had been dragged under by the tide. The same bone-deep helplessness threatened to suffocate him.

Vincent hovered outside the ICU doors, mind blank, every muscle locked with tension. Only when the doctor finally emerged did his world snap back into focus. His voice came out rough as he asked, "How is she?"

"She's stable now," the doctor replied, his tone calm but firm."She suffered anaphylactic shock after ingesting a large dose of medication she's severely allergic to. She's out of danger." Relief broke over Vincent in a shaky wave. He closed his eyes,the breath he'd been holding spilling out at last. "Thank you."

From that moment on, Vincent never left Brinley's side.

After some time, Brinley opened her eyes, her skin still deathly pale."Vincent?"

He leaned in, relief flooding his features. "Hey, are you feeling hungry at all?"

She offered a faint shake of her head. "Sorry for making you worried... I'm alright now. Really."

He studied her closely, worry etched into the lines around his eyes. "What happened? How did you end up taking something you're allergic to?"

Her eyes flickering, she winced, searching for words. "|-must've mixed up my heart meds by accident. Maybe I just picked up the wrong bottle without realizing it. I swear, I'll be more careful from now on."

His gaze lingered, searching for any sign she was hiding pain,and then he nodded slowly. "Alright."

He didn't doubt her words. Luckily, it turned out to be no big deal. He finally pulled out his phone to check his messages. A new notification from Derek waited on the screen-he'd already picked up Hannah.



Upon arriving at the mall, Hannah immediately recognized the familiar license plate gleaming in the afternoon sun.

Derek was already waiting there, stepping out of the car with a broad grin as soon as he spotted her. He hurried over and swung open the car door. "Mrs. Jones."

Hannah slipped inside, her fingers moving quickly as she texted Hannah slipped inside, her fingers moving quickly as she texted her parents to let them know she was on the way.

She'd barely set her phone aside when, out of nowhere,another car veered recklessly across their path. It cut them off in a flash of metal and screeching tires. Derek barely had a split second to react. He stomped on the brake, but it was already too late.

A sickening crash echoed inside the vehicle. The impact jolted both of them as the airbags exploded with a deafening pop.Hannah's phone shot from her lap, vanishing into the narrow gap between the seats.

Her seatbelt dug hard into her collarbone, leaving a raw,throbbing welt. Somewhere on her arm, warm blood seeped from a shallow cut. Dazed, she groped blindly for her phone,desperate to call for help.

Suddenly, the car's Bluetooth sprang to life. Vincent's voice cut through the chaos, sharp with worry. "What happened?"

Derek answered, his voice trembling, "Mr. Jones, we were crossing the Bayring Overpass when..."

A burst of static interrupted him. Vincent's panicked shout came through, ragged and frantic, layered over a chorus of distant voices. "Brinley! Doctor, what's going on over there?Why did she faint again?"
###Chapter 106 They Seemed To Fit Naturally Together
Not even half a plea escaped Derek's lips before Vincent ended the call without a hint of sympathy.

Hannah felt bitterness consume her. No concern, no patience -Vincent didn't even bother pretending when it came to her.There had been a foolish, fleeting second when she'd thought maybe, just maybe, he would fetch help for her. What a joke.

Aik caught painfully in Hannah's chest. The blow left her reeling,the world tilting around her. Shapes blurred as her eyelids fluttered. Doctors and nurses moved in, carefully transferring her to a stretcher.

After that, blackness swallowed everything.

Rushed into Dorbarrow Hospital, Hannah underwent test after test while Derek prowled the hallway, nerves wound tight with dread and guilt.

All he had to show for the crash was a shallow cut on his forehead. Hannah, though, looked far worse off.

Eventually, the exams ended, and a physician stepped out to deliver the news: she'd suffered a concussion and several scrapes, but nothing life-threatening if she got proper rest.Derek felt some of his worry lift at last.

For hours, Hannah remained unconscious, lost to the world until morning. When her eyes finally opened, the first thing she registered was that Derek was safe. Relief, faint but real, eased the tension in her heart.

"You're finally awake, Mrs. Jones," Derek said, his voice raw and guilt-ridden, eyes rimmed red. "I'm so sorry. If I hadn't been so guilt-ridden, eyes rimmed red "I'm so sorry if I hadn't been so careless, none of this would've happened The police say it's just a regular accident"

"It isn't on you," Hanmah replied, forcing steadimess into her tone despite the sharp ache in her belly and the colorless look on her face."I'll be fine."

Without another word, Derek bowed his head, the silence heavy between them.

Seeing the exhaustion etched on his face, Hannah encouraged him to go home and try to get some sleep.

Darkness eventually blanketed the city, and Hannah,propped up against her pillow, requested a phone from the attending nurse. She dialed her parents' number.

No mention was made of the crash-she simply told them that work had suddenly come up and she couldn't meet them at the station. Predictably, her parents scolded her through the phone.At least they hadn't wasted the whole evening waiting around at the terminal.

Raymond's voice sounded tired. "If work's got you tied up, then let Vincent come fetch us. This banquet is important, and we should really be there."

Margaret's agreement followed swiftly. "Exactly. They invited us, after all."

An uneasy silence lingered on Hannah's end before she finally admitted, "Mom, Dad, please don't go through the trouble.Vincent and I-we're getting a divorce. You won't need to meet him anymore."

"Divorce?" Margaret's voice broke with shock.

Raymond took control, speaking firmly into the receiver. "It's for the best. That family never fit us anyway. Let's not force something that doesn't belong. We'll skip the banquet and just something that doesn't belong. We'll skip the banquet and just head home. After everything's settled, your mother and I will come to get you."

A simple "Alright," was all Hannah managed. Once the call ended, she let the quiet settle over her, staring into the stillness until a shadow filled the doorway.

Felix burst in, breathless and anxious. "Hannah-are you okay?"

Her lips lifted in a weary smile, pale but genuine. "What brings
you here,Felix?”

"The app for your hormone-tracking wristband pinged your location at the hospital. The moment | saw it, I rushed straight here," Felix replied, anxiety lacing his words.

Settling into the chair at her bedside, he studied her closely."What happened,Hannah? Why did you end up in the hospital?"

With a gentle tone, she offered reassurance. "It was just a car accident. Nothing serious."

Actually, the whole ordeal had sparked fresh ideas about the wristband project they'd been pouring their efforts into. She gazed at Felix, sharing her thoughts. "Felix, I realized there's a flaw in the design-right now, the wristband can't pick up on emergencies-"

He didn't let her finish. "Let's talk shop after you're out of here.For now,you need to rest and heal."

That gentle rebuke brought a silent nod from Hannah,who let the topic drop.



Meanwhile,in another ward of the same hospital, Brinley faded in and out of awareness after "accidentally" taking something she was allergic to. Thankfully, a few hours of rest brought her color and strength back.
News from the doctor finally gave Vincent hope: she was out of danger.

He hadn't left her side all night, fatigue etched deeply on his face.

Right then, Vincent's phone vibrated with an incoming call When he looked, Derek's name showed up-along with a string of missed calls. Vincent answered right away.

Relief and urgency poured out as Derek spoke. "Finally! I've been trying to reach you-your wife was in a car accident!"

"How bad is it? Was she seriously injured?" Vincent's voice came out strained, his brow furrowed with concern.

"Fortunately, it wasn't too serious. She woke up earlier today."

A quiet "Alright," was all Vincent said before hanging up.

Eyes dropping to Derek's message with the ward number,Vincent wasted no time. He turned to Brinley. "I have to step out for a bit. I'll be back soon."

He barely got the words out before Brinley swung her legs off the bed, stepping in front of him to block his path.′′Vncent-was that about Hannah? Did something happen?"

"She was in a car accident."

Mock alarm widened Brinley's eyes. "Oh my! Is she okay? Let me come with you."

Feigned worry painted her face, but inside, her thoughts churned with anticipation-a twisted hope that Hannah's injuries might be worse than her expectation,ideally fatal.

In just a few minutes, Vincent and Brinley reached Hannah's hospital room. Through the open doorway, they caught sight of Felix seated at the bedside, carefully pressing a tissue to Hannah's lips. The scene between them was intimate, almost  Hannah's lips. The scene between them was intimate, almost wordless-two people so attuned to each other that they seemed to fit naturally together.
###Chapter 107 | Thought Miss Gilbert Was Your Wife
A piercing voice echoed from the entrance. "What are you doing?"

Felix gradually lowered his extended arm upon spotting the pair looming in the doorway.

Vincent's features grew grim. Hannah had ended up in the hospital after a vehicle collision, yet she chose not to inform him and instead informed Felix.

Brinley's chest tightened. She'd assumed the car incident was life-threatening, but witnessing Hannah alert and conscious ignited fury within her. Why hadn't the car crash finished Hannah off?

Hannah glanced over at Vincent and Brinley, visibly shocked for a split second, before swiftly averting her eyes. She had zero interest in acknowledging either of them.

Felix raised the water cup once more and offered softly to Hannah,"Would you like another sip?"

Hannah declined with a gentle shake of her head.

Vincent advanced to her bedside, livid. He clutched her wrist with such force that she winced. "You got into a wreck and thought I didn't need to know?"

The scent of perfume on him hit her, and with it came the memory of his frantic cries for Brinley just before she lost consciousness. Revulsion curled in her gut. She jerked away and spoke icily. "Inform you? Weren't you busy with Brinley? |wouldn't dream of interrupting." Vincent's jaw clenched. "I'm concerned about your condition."

"I don't need your concern," Hannah responded with a faint scoff,turning her head aside.

Brinley moved a step closer, affecting the softest tone she could manage. "Please don't misunderstand, Hannah. I abruptly felt unwell, and Vincent stayed by my side out of concern. But once he got the news about your car crash, he rushed here."

With false sympathy, Brinley asked, "Are you doing okay now?"

"Still alive," Hannah replied flatly. "If that's all, everyone can leave. I need quiet." Her eyelids shut firmly, signaling them to go.

Vincent leaned forward to adjust her sheet, suppressing the churning storm inside. "I'll arrange another ride for your parents.Just focus on recovery."

Hannah's lashes flew open. "No need. They won't be showing up."

He froze. Words hovered on the tip of his tongue, but her weary expression silenced him. She was still healing. He turned toward Felix. "Why are you still here?"

Felix held his gaze without flinching. "I'm not done talking to her."

"She's my wife!" Vincent hissed, voice like steel. "Don't forget where you stand. Stay away."

Brinley visibly recoiled at the phrase. Wife. One word alone scorched her with envy.

Felix's eyes turned icy. "Now you acknowledge her as your wife?Where were you when she got hit? Or when she came to?" His gaze shifted to Brinley, who stood firmly beside Vincent."Funny. I thought Miss Gilbert was your wife since you two seem almost inseparable." Vincent's expression darkened, the air around him turning frigid.His voice dropped into a chilling threat. "If you still want your firm to stay afloat, stay far from Hannah. She's not yours to approach."

"I've had it. Leave-every one of you!" Hannah shot upright,her tolerance gone. Though her face was drained of color, she powered through the pain, shoving each of them toward the hallway,one by one.

At last, silence reclaimed the hospital room.

Hannah spent seventy-two hours recovering. Through it all, she declined every attempt Vincent made to visit. She remained in steady communication with Felix, who provided updates on the wristband redesign. The upgraded edition now featured a distress mode: pressing the side button triggered a voice recorder and shared the wearer's coordinates with their emergency contact.

Hannah thought the enhancement was ingenious and offered more upgrade ideas.

Around the same time, an email arrived from SKY Philharmonic,the classical group Sharon adored. Hannah's persistent heartfelt emails had touched the agency-at last, they confirmed they would play at Sharon's seventieth birthday soirée.

It felt like a dream, and Hannah beamed. She quickly composed a formal invite, listed Sharon's favorite compositions, and penned a sincere note of appreciation.

For the first time in weeks, anticipation had stirred inside Hannah. She wanted everything to be magical for Sharon's birthday.

On Sharon's seventieth birthday, Hannah checked out of the hospital with her prescriptions in hand. Though reluctant, the nurses and doctors allowed her release-today mattered far nurses and doctors allowed her release-today mattered far too much for her to miss. Her voice had mostly returned,though her face remained pallid.

Hannah headed to a beauty parlor, hoping to regain some glow.If she appeared frail, Sharon would only grow anxious. She kept her cosmetics minimal-it took half an hour.

Following a stylist's suggestion, she selected a graceful gown in champagne tones and stepped into the fitting booth.

But before the curtain even closed, a shadow surged in, and a cloth clamped over her mouth and nostrils.
###Chapter 108 Vincent Isn't Even Married
Disoriented and drifting in and out of consciousness, Hannah realized she was being carried somewhere, her surroundings shifting beneath her.

A sharp, floral perfume clung to the air as a woman leaned in,yanking at Hannah's clothes. The click of a camera shutter sliced through the haze, followed by the sticky sound of Hannah's palm pressed onto a sheet of paper, leaving a smeared handprint as someone forced her limp fingers down.

Though Hannah's eyelids refused to lift, every word around her reached her with chilling clarity. About four men loomed close by, and a woman's voice-smooth, calculated, sickeningly familiar-cut through the confusion.

"Do whatever you want with her. Send me the video and I'll double your fee-an extra million," the woman promised, her tone icy and precise.

"Don't worry," one of the men replied, his laugh low and menacing. "You'll get exactly what you paid for."

Even half-conscious,Hannah knew that voice. It was none other than Brinley! A cold understanding settled in her gut.

As Brinley's footsteps faded, the last mask of civility dropped from the men in the room.

Hannah could hear them moving, the rustle of clothing hitting the floor. She forced herself back to full consciousness. No one was coming-if she wanted to survive, she'd have to fight her own way out.

She blinked hard, her vision swimming before the shapes She blinked hard, her vision swimming before the shapes around her finally sharpened into four looming figures.

The leader of the four men flashed a crooked grin. "So, you're finally up? Good. It's more fun when you're awake."

He leaned in, his rough hand reaching for her arm.

Hannah jerked away, her voice shaky but defiant. "Don't touch me! Do you even know who you're dealing with?" Her right hand fumbled at her left wrist, searching for the emergency button on her waistband and pressing down.

The leader just scoffed, clearly unfazed. "You think that matters? Tonight, we own every inch of you."

The others burst into grating laughter, the sound echoing around the dim, stifling room.

They stripped down right in front of her, not bothering to hide their intentions. The leader shoved his phone at one of his companions. "You-get this on video."

Without warning, three men surged forward at Hannah.

She drew a desperate breath and yelled, "I'm Vincent's wife!Lay a hand on me, and he'll destroy you all!"

One of them barked out a laugh, flashing a cruel smile."Vincent? That guy's not even married. Nice try,sweetheart."

Rough hands reached for her jeans, fingers clawing at the waistband.

Panic clawed up her throat. In a burst of adrenaline, her gaze landed on a heavy glass ashtray on the nightstand. She scrambled backward, snatching it up, and swung it with all her strength.

"Ow!" The ashtray cracked against a man's skull. He howled,blood pouring down his face as he staggered back, clutching blood pouring down his face as he staggered back, clutching his head.

For a heartbeat, the other two froze in shock, dumbfounded by her sudden ferocity.

"You little bitch-how dare you fight back?" The man filming tossed his phone aside in a rage and lunged straight at Hannah.

She kicked out, aiming for his knees, but he dodged with practiced speed.

Snarling, he seized Hannah by the throat, squeezing until her breath caught in her chest.

"What are you idiots waiting for? Get her clothes off and start filming already!"

Hannah's limbs were pinned, panic and nausea rising in her throat as she fought in vain to break free.



Meanwhile, the birthday banquet unfolded without a hitch.Sharon kept scanning the crowd, peppering Vincent with questions about Hannah's whereabouts.

Vincent hadn't breathed a word to his grandmother about Hannah's "car accident"-he wanted Hannah to rest for a few more days in the hospital. Instead, he soothed Sharon with a gentle lie: Hannah was with her parents and would arrive soon.The truth was, Hannah had denied his visit. Thus, he'd sent Derek to check up on her.

Suddenly, Vincent's phone buzzed with an unexpected location ping-one word stood out. "Danger."

Vincent ignored it.

Ten minutes later, Derek strode over with unexpected news-Hannah had been discharged from the hospital. Vincent's gaze swept the room, scanning the sea of party guests. Hannah was nowhere to be found. She must've left the hospital early to attend his grandmother's birthday, but her absence gnawed at him. A sudden, cold premonition flashed through his mind. Was Hannah in trouble?

Vincent didn't hesitate. Barking orders to his bodyguards, he pushed through the crowd and vanished out the door.

From across the hall, Brinley watched Vincent's abrupt departure, frowning. Was he getting close to the truth about Hannah's disappearance? Perhaps. But it hardly mattered now.

She took a slow sip of wine, savoring her private triumph. Even if-Vincent found Hannah's location, he'd arrive too late-almost an hour had passed. By now, those men would have stripped away every ounce of Hannah's dignity. Vincent would only find the aftermath.

Brinley had already erased any trace of her involvement,having paid handsomely to wipe the surveillance footage clean. No one would ever link her to what had happened.

Content, Brinley glided across the ballroom to Danica, her expression bright with satisfaction. She pressed the property transfer document into Danica's hand, as if bestowing a gift upon her.



A violent crash shattered the silence as the hotel room door flew open, the sound ricocheting off the walls.

All four men jerked around, caught off guard by the sudden intrusion.

A squad of bodyguards burst inside, moving with razor-sharp precision as they tackled and pinned the four naked men to the floor Relief washed through Hannah. Her trembling hand finally slackened as she realized her bracelet's signal had worked.With a shaky exhale, she let consciousness slip away.

Vincent strode in after the chaos, his expression carved from stone as he took in the wreckage and Hannah's battered state.He didn't waste a word. Crossing to the bed in long strides,he draped his tailored suit jacket over her and scooped her gently into his arms.

He held her close, glaring at the four trembling men with a look that could freeze blood. All pretense of restraint had vanished. White-hot rage crackled beneath his composed surface as he surveyed the cowering group. "Snap their damn arms." His voice was low and absolute, carrying a threat so chilling that it cut straight to the bone.

"Understood." The bodyguards sprang into action, ignoring the four men's desperate howls as they carried out Vincent's orders with ruthless precision.

Vincent's gaze raked over Hannah, every fresh bruise fueling the fury simmering in his veins. Without warning, he drove his foot into the ribs of the closest man, his control shattered by rage. He shot his men a glacial look. "Find out who's behind this. If you can't, consider yourselves fired." The command left no room for argument.

"Understood."

Vincent jerked his chin as he added, "And get a doctor here.Now." His tone was tight with urgency.

At once, the team scattered to handle his demands.

Vincent carried Hannah into a luxury suite, handling her with care. Before the doctor arrived, he gently dressed her in fresh clothes.

After the examination, the doctor calmly explained, "She After the examination, the doctor calmly explained, "She inhaled an anesthetic and went into shock-that's why she fainted. She should be all right after some rest. But once she wakes, it's best to take her to the hospital for a full evaluation,just in case she's suffered any internal injuries."

Relief washed over Vincent, his shoulders finally relaxing.

Meanwhile, Danica and Brinley wouldn't stop calling, urging Vincent to come back to the party. Not wanting his grandmother to catch wind of what had happened to Hannah,he quickly hired a caregiver to look after Hannah and made his way back to the party.

About fifteen minutes later, Hannah's eyes fluttered open.Disoriented, she pushed herself upright and then bolted from the suite on instinct, desperate for a way out. She sprinted blindly down the long, unfamiliar hallway, panic clouding her sense of direction.

All at once, she crashed into a solid wall of muscle. She staggered back, breathless, and looked up-only to see Miles standing in front of her.
###Chapter 109 About To Get Engaged
Gripping onto Miles like a castaway clutching driftwood, Hannah implored, "Mr. Whitaker, I need your help. Someone tried to assault me."

Miles's brow twitched faintly. Finding her in the corridor outside his hotel room was beyond his expectations. His response was frosty. "What's this now? Some new tactic to seduce me?"

Steadying herself, Hannah lifted her sleeves to show the dark marks along her neck and arm. Her tone didn't waver, her gaze unflinching. "I'm telling the truth. I was brought here against my will."

Miles stood impassive. "Who exactly tried anything? There's no one behind you."

A chill spread through her chest. She didn't push any further."Then... Can I borrow your device? I need to contact a friend for a ride."

She recognized her impulsiveness-what she truly needed was to reach Rena.

Miles eyed her with skepticism, still unsure what to make of her. But in the end, he offered the phone.

"I appreciate it," she whispered, sincerely thankful.

Through his assistance, she was finally able to relay her exact whereabouts. So this was the Lightwell Hotel-only a few streets away from the Jones residence. That was why Brinley had shown up so quickly by those men's side. The distance was negligible.Not long after, Rena came to collect Hannah.



Vincent hadn't been able to remain away from the party long.Even though the night was in Sharon's honor, being the Jones family head meant he had responsibilities.

Out of nowhere, a call came from the caregiver. Hannah had disappeared. He instantly strode to the door, but he almost collided with Hannah walking in.

His face instantly relaxed. "You're safe. I'll take you to the hospital first." Remembering the family physician's advice, he reached out to take her wrist.

"No need," Hannah answered, pulling away. "Let's just go inside."

She moved forward, and he kept close behind. "I've already ordered an investigation into the assault."

Hannah halted and glanced back at him. He couldn't find her -Rena must've told him what had happened. Her voice held no warmth. "What if I said I already know who did it?"

"Who?" he asked, stepping to block her path.

"Brinley," she answered, voice tight with fury.

Vincent's reaction was immediate. "That's not possible. She was present at the party all evening, welcoming everyone.She couldn't have done it."

"Really?" Hannah replied with a dry chuckle. "Then we're done talking." She turned away, not interested in continuing.

Vincent seized her arm. "Don't be unreasonable. Just let me take you to the hospital."

"If you're not on my side, Vincent, stay out of this." She yanked her arm away. The sudden motion disturbed her injury, and she her arm away. The sudden motion disturbed her injury, and she turned pale from the sting.

He didn't attempt to touch her again. Just then, one of Sharon's longtime friends came to greet him.

Seizing the chance, Hannah walked inside. The party was nearing its end. Sharon was nowhere in sight, likely having gone upstairs by now.

Hannah stepped forward just as the SKY Philharmonic concluded their last piece.

At the same moment, Danica had been actively presenting Brinley to the elite guests. "This is Brinley Gilbert," she said with a proud smile. "She recently returned from overseas. She and Vincent grew up together, and the two of them are about to get engaged."

"Oh? Sounds like Vincent's big day is just around the corner,"one guest remarked.

Brinley offered a soft, shy smile, and Danica responded instead,"The ring's already selected. We're just waiting for Brinley to give the word."

"I heard you organized everything for tonight's event, Miss Gilbert. It's been spectacular-flawless, really," another commented.

Brinley kept her expression gracious. "Sharon's birthday is important to all of us. It's my first time handling something like this, so I made sure every detail is perfect."

Danica added fondly, "Brinley's always cared deeply for the Jones family. She barely slept these last few nights, just to make this evening perfect."

"You really are the epitome of elegance, Miss Gilbert. But I have to ask-how in the world did you manage to book the SKY Philharmonic? My dad adores them, and we've never been SKY Philharmonic? My dad adores them, and we've never been able to get them. They're nearly unreachable!"

That compliment thrilled Brinley. She figured that since the orchestra was based abroad, it was likely that no one here had any direct contact with them. Straightening her spine, she answered fluidly, "The representative for the SKY Philharmonic is an old friend of mine. We actually had dinner last week."

"Remarkable network, Miss Gilbert. Knowing someone in that league is extraordinary." A woman's voice emerged from the crowd, slicing through the air. People instinctively moved aside to make way.

Brinley froze in disbelief the second she recognized the speaker-Hannah. Those worthless goons! They couldn't even finish Hannah off on the bed! And now she was back to destroy everything.
###Chapter 110 Exposing Her Lies Again
The moment Hannah spoke, every eye in the banquet hall swung her way.

A ripple of whispers spread through the crowd-those who recognized her wasted no time.

"Isn't that the woman Mr. Jones kept around for years?"someone muttered, peering over a champagne glass. "What's she even doing here?"

"Isn't it obvious? She came to cause a scene. She must've found out that Mr. Jones is announcing his engagement to Miss Gilbert today and couldn't handle it."

Brinley's lips curled with self-satisfied delight as she absorbed guests' contemptuous remarks against Hannah.

Danica pushed through the guests, scanning the room with a mounting sense of panic. When she failed to spot Vincent, she snatched Hannah's wrist in a tight grip. "What are you doing here? You've been missing all day, and now you show up just to stir up trouble?"

Hannah steadily met her gaze. "Why am I here? Didn't you know?" she retorted, her voice ringing clear and steady. "I came to take back what's rightfully mine."

Danica's hand faltered, her grip falling away.

Hannah squared her shoulders and strode straight toward Brinley, fixing her with a level stare. "Miss Gilbert, there's something I can't quite figure out. Maybe you can help me understand."A flicker of unease passed over Brinley's face. The memory of the "Victoria" incident lingered like a shadow, making her instantly wary. She forced a brittle smile, deflecting with practiced ease. "Ms. Scott, if you're here to celebrate Sharon's birthday, you're more than welcome. But if you're just looking for a fight over Vincent, I'll have to call security and have you shown out."

Danica fell in line beside Brinley, her voice sharp. "That's right.Hannah, stop hanging on to Vincent. Let it go already."

The crowd swelled with low, judgmental whispers-accusing Hannah of scheming for money, calling her desperate and shameless.

Hannah answered their scorn with a cool, cutting laugh. Her gaze locked on Brinley, lips curling into a slight smirk. "Why so flustered, Miss Gilbert? All I wanted was to ask-since the SKY Philharmonic has been performing in Azravia all week, how did you manage to have dinner with their agent?"

Brinley stiffened, but the sight of a room full of guests on her side helped her regain composure. A chilly confidence slipped into her smile. "Of course, I flew to Azravia to meet him. ls there an issue with that?"

Hannah's lips curled into a sly, pointed smile. "None at all-unless you count the fact that SKY Philharmonic spent last week performing in Bellmoor, not Azravia. So who exactly did you have dinner with?"

A ripple of murmurs swept through the crowd. One of the guests pulled out their phone. "She's right! The SKY Philharmonic's schedule shows they were in Bellmoor last week."

"Wait, are you saying Miss Gilbert lied?"

"Come on, Miss Gilbert is Mr. Jones's fiancée. Would she really need to lie about something like this?" For a heartbeat, panic flickered in Brinley's eyes-Hannah had blindsided her again. But she recovered with a quick,breezy laugh. "I've barely slept all week pulling this banquet together.I must have mixed up the details."

Danica chimed in, "Brinley's barely slept these past few days.Anyone would forget details with that kind of pressure."

Hannah's tone turned mocking, as if she'd stumbled onto the punchline of a private joke. "Busy with banquet plans, huh?"She gave Brinley a slow, icy smile. "You really pulled out all the stops this time, Mss Gilbert."

With a glint of mischief, Hannah locked her gaze firmly on Brinley. "Since you've been so involved, I'm sure you know every detail of tonight's music program. Why don't you tell us -which piece did the SKY Philharmonic choose to headline?"

Brinley's composure slipped for an instant. "I... I don't remember."

Hannah arched a brow, her voice sharpened with disdain. "You don't remember, or you just don't know? You didn't plan any of this banquet, and that's why you can't answer a single question."

Her accusation sent a ripple through the crowd. Murmurs broke out at once.

"Wait-Miss Gilbert didn't even remember 'Midnight Bloom?'That's the featured piece tonight!" someone blurted out.

"And what's even stranger-Miss Scott seems to know everything about this event," another guest remarked, their curiosity piqued.
###Chapter 111 Who Is Your Wife

The guests' murmurs lacked volume, though the clarity made them unmistakable.

Guests exchanged hushed comments, and some began rallying behind Hannah, deepening Brinley's bitterness toward her.

In that moment, any further words were futile. Brinley required an advocate to speak in her place. She turned toward Danica with pleading eyes.

Danica touched Brinley's arm and let out a cold laugh, her words slicing with scorn. "Hannah, you're envious of Brinley.Vincent was kind enough to allow you to help plan the birthday gathering, yet now you're lashing out at Brinley and acting like you orchestrated the whole event."

Hearing that, Brinley glanced at Danica, her eyes glossy."Danica, I am fine. Let's ignore her nonsense. She's not worth our time."

"Miss Scott has been difficult since arriving. Miss Gilbert hasn't had peace because of her," one guest commented.

"Mr. Jones is to blame for ever keeping Ms. Scott around, and Miss Gilbert ends up carrying the burden."

In an instant, Brinley gained the crowd's favor once again.

Hannah regarded Brinley and Danica's performance without reacting, her gaze laced with sarcasm.

Abruptly, a tall man parted the crowd. His blonde hair stood out as he declared, "Ms. Scott, it's a pleasure to finally meet you." Gasps rippled through the guests. Wasn't that the SKY Philharmonic manager? Could it be-he recognized Hannah?

Brinley's face remained unreadable as she didn't recognize the man at all.

Hånnah's expression lit up as she embraced him. "Mr. Smnith,are you leaving?"

Pollock Smith remained courteous and warm, his eyes lingering on Hannah with clear regard. "Indeed. I came just to bid farewell. Everyone in our ensemble adores you. Let's talk longer next time."

"Of course," Hannah answered.

They waved goodbye to each other.

Hannah turned to Brinley, her tone laced with steel,"Miss Gilbert, you said you've known the manager of SKY Philharmonic for years. But why didn't Mr. Smith recognize you,and why did you act like he was a stranger to you? You've been lying all along."

Brinley had missed the exchange entirely, too busy scrambling for her next move. Her pulse stuttered. That man was the SKY Philharmonic manager?

Danica appeared completely stunned.

"This twist is too sudden. So Mr. Jones' fiancée really lied?" one of the guests gasped.

"Of course. Mr. Smnith clearly doesn't know Miss Gilbert."

"I knew Ms. Scott came prepared."

"But isn't Ms. Scott from an ordinary family? How does she know Pollock Smith?"

A fresh wave of whispers filled the room. Some remarks turned cruel, and Brinley's hands curled into fists.

Noticing this, Danica stepped in to confront Hannah, grabbing her hand. "You always bring chaos. Get out. The Jones family doesn't welcome you."

Hannah shook Danica off, a sneer tugging at her lips. "Not welcome me? Yet, you accept the mnistress?"

"Hannah!" Brinley barked, brows drawn tightly together.

Amusement twinkled in Hannah's eyes as she smirked. "Why shout? The mistress label hits too close?"

Brinley's face twitched, her features darkening. "You're just some man's pet. How dare you label me a mistress?"

She took a chance, gambling that Hannah wouldn't expose her secret marriage to Vincent.

The crowd erupted in disbelief.

"Has Ms. Scott lost her mind? She called Mr. Jones' fiancée a mistress?"

"Exactly, who gave her the guts?"

"Is she causing a scene because she feels shortchanged?"

"She probably had her own motives when she approached Mr.Jones."

Hannah stood tall, calmly listening to the audience's speculation. Lifting her gaze, she spotted Vincent stepping in from outside and called out, "Vincent, clear it up-who's your wife?"

Brinley's gamble had failed.
###Chapter 112 She Was The Other Woman

Danica hadn't anticipated Hannah dropping the truth about the secret marriage so bluntly. Her lips twitched faintly, and her face contorted with fury. "Hannah, what trash are you blabbering? Hold your tongue. I handed over those estates for what?"

"What estates?" Vincent's cold tone sliced through the tension,grabbing the room's attention as the onlookers instinctively shifted aside.

Before Hannah could respond,Danica promptly stepped in and attempted to defuse the tension. "Vincent, it's nothing important. Why don't you go bid the guests farewell? I'll settle this."

One glance at the frozen triangle of women was all Vincent needed to grasp-conflict had erupted again. He caught the unease in Brinley's demeanor and instinctively slid an arm around Hannah's waist, attempting to guide Hannah away."Don't cause a scene. Let's leave."

But Hannah shoved him off and retreated a few steps. "I'm staying here until this gets sorted." She raised her volume."Right here,right now-make it clear. Who's your lawfulspouse?"

Vincent stood there in silence, feeling this wasn't the time or place to go public. His brows knit together. "This is my grandma's celebration. Could you not choose such a time?"

Brinley's heart danced with delight. Vincent was unmistakably backing her up. She darted to his side, pretending to be hurt."I don't know what's wrong with Hannah today. She's been attacking me nonstop. I truly have no clue why." Danica hadn't anticipated Hannah dropping the truth about the secret marriage so bluntly. Her lips twitched faintly, and her face contorted with fury. "Hannah, what trash are you blabbering? Hold your tongue. I handed over those estates for what?"

She's been attacking me nonstop. I truly have no clue why."  Danica quickly added, "Vincent, you need to put your foot down. Hannah's lost her grip."

With both Danica and Vincent siding with Brinley, the spectators immediately shifted their opinion-Hannah was cast as the aggressor again.

Hannah felt the sting of their mocking, dismissive glances.Brinley and Danica even shared a brief, triumphant smirk.

Vincent's jaw tensed as his gaze swept across the murmuring crowd.He reached for Hannah once more, but she stormed off before he could reach her-his fingers grazed only the trailing fabric of her gown.

Hannah strode to the massive display in the hall, pulled a USB stick from her handbag, and inserted it into the screen's input.

Guests surged forward in curiosity, eager to witness her next move.

Without a word, Hannah flashed an image of a marriage certificate onto the oversized screen. She'd snapped it onthe day she and Vincent completed their legal registration. She never dreamed she'd one day have to use it to defend her title.It had been such a pathetic marriage. But at least it was ending -today.

As soon as the marriage certificate appeared, the crowd erupted. The "fiancée" was actually the mistress? What a shocking twist!

All gazes swiveled toward Brinley, now laced with distrust and judgment.

Brinley balled her fists, inhaled deeply, and then cast a pitying Look at Hannah. "I'd wanted to spare you the embarrassment,"she said.

Brinley tilted her head slightly, a cunning gleam flashing in her Brinley tilted her head slightly, a cunning gleam flashing in her eyes before masking it with a somber face. "I barely knew you,but I thought you carried decency and pride. So I was crushed -utterly crushed-when I saw that footage."

Brinley hadn't come unarmed. She'd been waitingfor the footage from those four men, but it never came. So, she'd shifted her tactics.

Curious, someone in the room asked, "What footage?"

Brinley paused, seemingly embarrassed to elaborate. "It's... It's a recording of Hannah with four men. Making out. I was stunned.I never imagined she was that kind of person."

Vincent's expression darkened. "Brinley, stop inventing lies."

Danica rushed to her defense, "Why would Brinley fabricate such a thing? She must've gotten something. And who knowS -maybe that is what Hannah is really like."

"I'm not lying, Vincent," Brinley insisted, turning toward the crowd. "It's true. Hannah was..."

With that, she held up her phone and, without pause, streamed the footage onto the wide screen.

Gasps echoed through the venue. Dozens of phones were instantly raised.

The video was short-only five seconds-but horrifying. The frame zoomed squarely on Hannah's face. She was naked,pinned beneath four undressed men. Their faces were obscured,but hers was clearly exposed.

Hannah's breath hitched. The camera clicks she'd faintly heard before passing out now made horrifying sense.

Without saying a word, Vincent strode over and yanked the device from Brinley's grip, terminating the stream at once. "If this footage leaks-even a second of it-everyone here will be this footage leaks-even a second of it-everyone here will be held accountable." His tone was freezing, clipped, and lethal.His gaze swept across the room like blades. Under his stare,everyone froze and then gradually lowered their phones in silence.
###Chapter 113 I'm Deeply Disappointed In You
Danica's cheeks burned with shame, her eyes darting to Hannah furiously. The longer she stared at Hannah,the more her lip curled in open revulsion. "Vincent, didn't I warn you? She's just a filthy whore who never learned any manners."

Vincent's gaze cut straight through the noise. His voice came out icy and clipped as he turned to Brinley. "Erase the video."

Brinley froze for a moment before realizing that Vincent was taking Hannah's side. Disbelief flickered across her features."Vincent, after seeing how shameless Hannah is, you're still defending her?"

"There's no way she'd do something like that," Vincent replied,his voice low and certain.

Brinley's composure cracked. "How could she possibly not?|saw it with my own eyes! She checked into Lightwell Hotel this morning-with four men!" She brandished her phone, waving it like a weapon. On the screen, a photo of Hannah appeared,her hair rumpled and clothes in disarray. "See for yourself,Vincent. This is who she really is-you've been fooled."

Vincent's expression faltered. His gaze lingered on the picture.Those clothes... Weren't they the same ones Hannah had on when he'd found her earlier?

Assuming he believed her claims, Brinley made an attempt to latch onto his arm, her eyes shining with victory.

But before she could say another word, Hannah strode forward and delivered a stinging slap across Brinley's cheek.

Brinley staggered back, disbelief etched across her face."How Brinley staggered back, disbelief etched across her face. "How dare you hit me?"

Hannah's expression never wavered. She drew her arm back and delivered another slap-harder, sharper, echoing through the ballroom. "I know exactly what you did. You paid four men to try to rape me."

At this, the room erupted into gasps and shocked murmurs. A mistress orchestrating an attack on the wife? No one could process such a bombshell.

Brinley stood rooted to the spot, her mind spinning. How the hell did Hannah figure it out? She'd covered every trace,destroyed the footage-there was no way any evidence remained.

Struggling to compose herself, Brinley forced a trembling sob,tears spilling down her cheeks. "The video's already out there.You are still denying it and even trying to frame me for hiring those men? How low can you stoop to?"

Danica didn't hesitate, planting herself beside Brinley like a loyal guard dog. "This is beyond humiliating, Hannah. If I were you,l'd crawl into a hole and never come out. That video is disgusting enough-there's nothing left to say. Shameless doesn't even cover it."

Hannah's lips twisted into a cold, triumphant smile. "Oh, thanks for reminding me," she retorted sharply. "Faking a sex tape and hiring thugs to kidnap and assault me? That's more than enough to put you behind bars."

Brinley met Hannah's glare head-on, her chin raised defiantly."You really think you can just accuse me like that? I see right through it! You're furious I exposed you, so now you're desperate to drag me down with you. Pathetic."

With a scoff, Hannah regarded Brinley as though she were some sad spectacle at a circus. Her gaze was sharp, practically some sad spectacle at a circus. Her gaze was sharp, practically humming with derision. "Drag you down? Why don't you tell everyone what this is, then?"

Hannah strode back to the towering projection screen, each step deliberate and steady. Without another word, she tapped her phone, and an audio file sprang to life.

In the record, Brinley's words reverberated off the marble walls,her tone ice-cold and unflinching. "Do whatever you want with her. Send me the video, and you'll get another million."

Then, a man's voice chimed in, greedy and eager. "Don't worry.We'll make sure you get your money's worth." The record ended.

Without warning, Hannah tapped the replay icon, sending the damning audio blaring through the hall, every word amplified for all to hear.

Brinley stood rooted to the spot, her face draining of color.Panic flashed in her eyes-how could Hannah possibly have that recording? She'd been completely unconscious then.There was no chance she could've recorded that.

Desperate,Brinley lunged for Vincent's arm, fat tears welling up and spilling down her cheeks. "Vincent, please, you have to believe me! That's not real, I swear-someone faked it! I would never do something so awful!"

The crowd buzzed, shock rippling through the guests.Everything clicked into place-Brinley had really hired someone to harm Hannah. Hannah hadn't lied or slandered anyone. It was Brinley who'd tried to frame Hannah after plotting against Hannah.

Vincent's gaze bore into Brinley, cold and unyielding. The photo Brinley had flaunted earlier left no room for doubt-she had a hand in what had happened to Hannah. And Hannah had nearly been violated. Vincent's voice dropped to a glacial calm, each word laced with cutting disdain. "Brinley, I never imagined you could stoop this low. I'm deeply disappointed in you."

He pulled his arm free, and Brinley, thrown off-balance,crashed to the marble floor with a startled gasp.

Danica hurried over to help Brinley up, her voice quivering."Vincent, there must be some kind of misunderstanding. Brinley would never do something like this."

Tears shimmered in Brinley's eyes as she pleaded, her voice trembling, "Vincent, you don't believe me?"

Vincent turned away, jaw clenched, his face a mask of icy indifference.

Brinley dragged herself upright, fury flashing in her eyes. She jabbed a finger at Hannah, her voice piercing."You're a master at twisting the truth, aren't you? Why don't you explain the video of you crawling into bed with four men? Audio can be faked, but that footage is real!" A brittle, mocking laugh slipped from her lips. "You can't argue with what's right there on the screen-your face is unmistakable."
###Chapter 114 The Video Was Falsified
A slow, sardonic smile played on Hannah's lips. "These days,even a child knows how simple it is to fake a video."

That comment left Brinley at a loss, her composure slipping for just a second.

A deep breath later, Brinley found her voice. "Fake? Please.The only reason you'd say that is because you're too nervous to-·explain why you were with those four men."

Standing right þeside Brinley, Danica jabbed a finger in Hannah's direction, voice rising with every word. "Brinley's got a point. You are a wanton woman-leave my son out of your mess. Fivesome? Shame on you!"

"That's enough!" Vincent's jaw clenched, tension visible in every muscle. "I won't hear another word about this."

Not backing down, Brinley interjected, "Vincent, your mom is right-Hannah's a lady of easy virtue."

A hard edge crept into Vincent's tone. "Brinley, shut up!" His glare was cold as he turned from her to Hannah. "This ends here. No more mentioning it."

Hannah's eyes met his, cold and glinting with mockery."You want me to drop it? Vincent, you just want this swept under the rug for Brinley's sake, don't you?" Laughter escaped her,low and biting. "Don't think I didn't catch the warning in that last comment. You're telling me to shut up and move on."

Hannah saw right through it. Whatever the truth was, Vincent didn't seem to care-his real worry was protecting Brinley from any fallout. He always had been too invested where Brinley  any fallout. He always had been too invested where Brinley was concerned. Still, it didn't matter. She would walk away from him today.

Brows knitting with worry, Vincent tried again. "If this gets out,it won't be good for you. I'm doing this for your sake."

Laughter spilled from Hannah's lips, though her eyes were cold."You don't have to pretend you're doing this for me."

Determination flared within Hannah-she wanted the truth about Brinley's scheme exposed for everyone to see. A slow arch of her brow, and she fixed Brinley with a steady look."Tell me, Brinley-where did you get that video?"

Panic flickered across Brinley's features, but she tried to sound confident."Someone sent it to me."

Not letting up, Hannah pressed for more. "Who sent it? Was it one of those so-called four men? Let's call him in right now and settle this."

"I have no idea who he is. It was sent anonymously," Brinley said, her fingers fidgeting as her eyes darted away.

"In that case, the chat history can be pulled up. I know people who can track down the sender's IP address." Hannah reached out her hand, clearly expecting Brinley to hand over the phone.

"I deleted the chat logs," Brinley said, hiding her phone behind her back, forcing an apologetic expression.

Arms folding, Hannah swept her gaze over Brinley. "No contact details. NNo chat history. And you claim you have no idea who your mysterious source is." Thoughtfully, she began to lay out her reasoning. "Here's the thing-I have no memory of ever being with four men. Yet, the video makes it look like I was right there."

Hannah didn't hesitate as she drew her conclusion. "There's only one logical explanation. That video was made with  only one logical explanation. That video was made with deepfake technology."

A murmur ran through the crowd as realization dawned-her argument actually made sense. Advances in artificial intelligence had made such fakes frighteningly believable. Still,suspicion lingered-was Brinley really capable of going this far just to hurt Hannah?

Curious faces swiveled toward Brinley,searching for any flicker of guilt or unease.

Instead of faltering, Brinley returned their scrutiny with a cool,almost mocking smile. Not a single crack appeared in her composure. "Deepfake, really? You'll invent any excuse rather than admit the truth, Hannah."

"Why rush? I've brought proof with me." Mocking amusement colored Hannah's words as she eyed Brinley. "Take a closer look-there's a moment where the face glitches, and the skin looks unnaturally perfect. No pores at all. That's Al, plain and simple."

Countless hours spent studying artificial intelligence for her potential partnership with VitraMind had taught Hannah exactly what to look for in a fake.

"Honestly, whoever tried that face swap didn't even do a good job," Hannah added, her voice cold.

An undercurrent of disbelief ran through Hannah's gaze-she never expected Brinley to go this far out of hatred.

"That's ridiculous. You're just making things up as you go,"Brinley retorted, biting her lip in a desperate attempt to deny everything.

A harsh, scornful laugh escaped Hannah. "Still want to stand by your lies? How about we let a real Al analyst take a look at your video? Experts won't be fooled." Fingers shaking, Brinley reached for Vincent's sleeve, her panic clear. "Vincent, please! You have to trust me. The video's real -I never used any deepfake tricks!"

A heavy frown settled over Vincent's features as he chimed in,"Just apologize to Hannah so we can move past this."

Hannah stared at them coldly. Vincent seriously expected her to drop it like that? She had almost been assaulted and had a fake explicit video of her played publicly. How could she let it go?

"No fucking way would I drop it! Brinley will pay for every bit of what happened today," Hannah said firmly, vowing to never forgive or forget.

Seeing that resolve, Vincent's frown only deepened. His tone sharpened. "Brinley. Apologize now. Dragging this out won't help you:"

Defiance hardened Brinley's jaw as she bit her lip. "And why should I ever apologize to someone who can't stay loyal in her marriage?"
###Chapter 115 Let's Get Divorced
A wave of gasp rippled through the crowd. Hannah had been unfaithful? Whispers darted from table to table, eyes glinting with hungry curiosity. Wasn't it just proven that the sex tape was a fake, Hannah's image stitched together with Al trickery?Was Brinley still pushing her point?

Vincent's patience snapped. "Brinley, enough already. Stop spouting nonsense!"

Brinley squared her shoulders, defiance in her eyes. "That's not nonsense!"

She snatched her purse from the table and rifled through it with trembling hands, finally revealing a document and waving it for all to see.

"Here. This proves Hannah's been unfaithful for a long time-she's even pregnant with another man's child." Brinley jabbed a finger at the abortion record, her gaze never leaving Vincent's face as she waited for his reaction.

Instantly, the ballroom buzzed with speculation, the din rising to a fever pitch. Hannah simply crossed her arms, lips curled into a chilly smile, and surveyed the unfolding spectacle.

Vincent stood paralyzed, his face a blank slate as he stared at Hannah. Just as he reached for the document, Danica snatched it out of Brinley's grasp.

"Hannah, seducing men is bad enough, but getting knocked up by one? That's just utterly shameful!" Danica's voice was sharp with contempt as she raised her hand, ready to slap Hannah across the face.Hannah's reflexes were faster-she seized Danica's wrist in midair and shoved her back with force. Danica staggered awkwardly, only staying upright because Brinley caught her at the last second.

A cold, mocking smile tugged at the corners of Hannah's mouth. So Brinley had really dug up dirt on her-even managed to uncover her miscarriage. Every move was orchestrated,every detail planned. Brinley was as ruthless as she was meticulous.

Danica's chin shot up, her voice sharp. "What? Dare to abort the child but lack the guts to admit it? You've been married to Vincent for five years without a child. Yet, the second you're with someone else, you turn up pregnant. Unbelievable, Hannah.Truly unbelievable."

Danica's cheeks burned with fury, and Brinley hovered close,quietly trying to steady her.

Vincent silently took the abortion record from Danica. His eyes locked on the date-just two weeks ago. Back then,he and Hannah had barely spoken, locked in endless arguments because of Brinley. They hadn't even touched each other. The truth hit him, cold and merciless-this child couldn't possibly be his.

A flash of realization hit him-Hannah and Felix had been nearly inseparable lately. And she'd taken birth control pills after being intimate with him.

A sudden ache twisted in Vincent's chest. Without warning,he strode forward and seized Hannah's wrist, his grip tight enough to make her flinch. His face was shadowed, his words razor-sharp."When did you get pregnant?"

Hannah let out a cold, brittle laugh. "You want an answer?" Her eyes glittered, but her voice was all ice. "I honestly don't remember." She'd buried the memory of that miscarriage deeply since the pain of it was something she refused to drag out again. She couldn't recall the exact date of that long-ago pregnancy-those details had blurred with time.

Vincent's fingers dug into her wrist, his voice low and tense."Don't remember? Then what do you remember? The man you slept with behind my back?"

The question hit Hannah harder than any accusation. For a moment, her calm facade cracked, disappointment flooding her eyes.

All this time, she'd believed V/incent's questions about the pregnancy came from regret-a hope that maybe he'd finally cared, even a little, after seeing the proof of her miscarriage.She'd thought his anger was rooted in the pain of discovering they'd lost a child together. But now she saw the truth: he'd believed every poisonous word Brinley whispered. In his eyes,she was nothing but a liar who'd betrayed him.

Hannah yanked her hand free, a sharp, cold smile curving her lips. "Oh, I remember him," she replied, her voice edged with defiance."And honestly? He was a thousand times the man you'll ever be. I think of him often-and I don't regret a second of it."

"That's enough!" Vincent's face clouded over, his chest rising and falling with rage. "Tell me-whose child is it?" he demanded firmly.

Hannah shot back, her tone sharp and mocking. "How many tímes do I have to say it? You don't get to question me about the child."

"Oh, I don't?" Vincent's fury surged as he closed the distance between them, hands clamping down on her shoulders,knuckles white with frustration. "Then who does? That man you slept with?" His hold was bruising, and Hannah struggled in vain against his iron grip. "Yes, anyone would have more right than you ever did."

Every mention of the child sent a dull throb twisting through her gut, a wound that never healed. She never wanted to relive it, but Vincent refused to let it die, digging into the scar until she bled. Her defenses crumbled, raw grief flickering in her eyes.

Vincent's fingers clamped down harder. Hannah's struggle aggravated her injury from the car incident. She gasped,the sound slipping through clenched teeth.

But Vincent seemed not to notice. He bore down,his tone glacial. "It's Felix's, isn't it?"

A tremor ran through Hannah, but not from fear or chill-only from the bone-deep ache of profound disappointment and heartbreak.He must have rehearsed this scenario in his mind countless times to ask with such certainty. He'd never really trusted her. This marriage was a complete failure.

Swallowing the hurt, Hannah lifted her chin, a bitter smile playing on her lips. "That's right. The child is Felix's. Is that what you wanted to hear?"

A furrow creased Vincent's brow as every suspicion he'd harbored now made perfect sense. No wonder he'd caught Hannah with Felix so often lately. He was supposed to see the truth in all those little details. His gaze flickered, torn between anger and hurt. "Give me an explanation."

Hannah didn't bother to lookup, her voice clipped and cold."There's nothing to say. You already made up your mind.Believe whatever you want."He could accuse her all he liked-she was done trying to justify herself. Yet, a pang of guilt twisted in her chest for dragging Felix into this mess.

Vincent finally let her go, stepping away with a bitter laugh."Did you get rid of your child with him out of guilt for me?"

Hannah rubbed her sore shoulders, her voice carrying a hollow pain. "You've got it all wrong. I never wanted to end the pregnancy. I wanted that child, but fate wouldn't let me have it."

Vincent's eyes burned with barely contained anger. "So you loveFelix that much? Enough to want to give birth to his child?"

He was livid. In stark contrast, one intimate night with him,she'd taken birth control without a second thought.

"That's right." Hannah met his gaze head-on, refusing to waver. "I love Felix. I wanted a child with him. Is that the answer you're looking for?"

Something in Vincent's expression shifted, his lips curling into a cold, bitter smile. "So that's it. All those times you demanded a divorce-you just couldn't wait to run to Felix."

A sharp, humorless laugh escaped Hannah. "You finally figured it out."

She dug into her bag and pulled out a stack of papers, setting them on the table between them. Her voice was flat, almost businesslike. "Here's the divorce agreement. I've already signed.No point dragging this out any longer. Let's get divorced."
###Chapter 116 A WomanWho's Been Unfaithful
Vincent stared at the divorce agreement, overwhelmed by the discovery that his name had already been signed. His brows lowered into a frown as he glared at Hannah. "At what moment did you compose this?"

Hannah responded with icy indifference, "Roughly four weeks ago."

"An entire month." Vincent released a bitter chuckle, sharp with contempt and fury. "You've been orchestrating to divorce from me for a whole month."

"That's right. I've been prepared to walk away for quite some time," Hannah replied bluntly, her gaze emotionless and sharp.

Vincent clenched his jaw, veins bulging at his temple.′′|SFelix the root of this?"

Hannah didn't respond immediately.

For thirty seconds, a tense stillness blanketed the room.

Hannah lowered her head slightly, appearing lost in memories of their shared past. "I don't love you anymore. There's nothing left to feel," she finally stated, her voice flat and drained.

Vincent's breathing grew uneven, a rough growl escaping his throat. "You were the one who pursued me, begged to marry me,and now you're throwing it all away. Why is it always your way?"

A flicker of disdain crossed Hannah's expression. "So what if i pursued you? Through all these eight years, I gave you everything-yet how did you ever repay me? And now you're  everything-yet how did you ever repay me? And now you're acting like some wounded soul, playing the victim? As if I wronged you? Don't be ridiculous."

Pausing, Hannah said with finality, her stare like frost,"I love fiercely and leave neatly. If I care, I go all in. If I'm finished,I walk away without looking back. Let's just end this. A clean break-for the benefit of us both."

A faint twitch disturbed Vincent's features, a chilling aura emanating from him. "You think I won't divorce you?"

"Of course not. I'm waiting for you to finalize the divorce certificate with me," Hannah answered coolly.

Her detached attitude completely pushed Vincent over the edge. His fury erupted like flames. "Fine, let's split! I refuse to be with a woman who's been unfaithful."

Though nis voice cut like steel, Hannah showed no reaction,her gaze cold and unwavering.

The guests gasped, stunned that Hannah, who had just been publicly acknowledged as Vincent's spouse, was already seeking a divorce.

Brinley and Danica shared a glance, clearly thrilled.

Vincent didn't shift his focus from Hannah. "Every time you've brought up a divorce over the last month, I've talked you out of it. But not this time. If you're this resolute, I won't stop you."

He searched her expression for the slightest remorse-there was none.

Hannah's stare was composed, her lips lifting into a faint smirk."In that case, much appreciated."

She added without pause, "Make sure you show up when it's time for the procedure." Checking her watch, Hannah turned toward Brinley with a composed grin. "Miss Gilbert, let's resolve what's between us."

Brinley froze in shock, instinctively backing away.

Suddenly, sirens wailed from the venue's entrance.
a
"Y-you contacted the police?" Brinley stammered, sweat forming rapidly as panic set in.

"Of course. Did you think I was bluffing?" Hannah's voice was firm, her eyes glinting with derision. "| told you-you wouldn't walk away untouched."

Danica's nerves flared, shouting, "Hannah! This is too much!Why involve the police today, of all days? Are you trying to ruin Sharon's celebration?"

Hannah's eyes were cold, her voice like a blade. "Don't bring Sharon into this. If Brinley hadn't crossed the line, I might've stayed quiet for Sharon for the time being. But Brinley hired men to assault me and even made a fake video to destroy my name. I'm not letting that go."

Before attending Sharon's gathering, Hannah had already instructed Rena to contact the authorities. Rena was dependable, and the police arrived quickly.

"Vincent! Please help! I don't want the police to arrest me,"Brinley begged, rushing toward him, hoping he'd shield her again like before.
###Chapter 117 But It Was You Who'd Strayed First
Vincent didn't budge, his expression unchanging, as though Brinley's words had vanished into thin air.

Brinley's eyes flickered for a second, and the next second,her breaths grew ragged and shallow, her hand fluttering to her chest in a dramatic display.

Danica rushed to her side, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. "Brinley, are you okay?"

Hannah arched a brow, a smirk tugging at her lips. "Not feeling well again, Brinley? It's alright. This time, I went ahead and called an entire medical team for you."

The color drained from Brinley's face as three doctors strode purposefully into the hall, their white coats unmistakable.

Hannah's laughter rang out, low and cutting. "Relax, they're the best in town. You'll get five-star care-even while you're being questioned."

Brinley's face changed drastically. Hannah, that vile woman,had her cornered with no way out. Pretending to faint was no longer an option.

Chaos erupted the instant uniformed police officers swept into the hall. "Who here is Brinley Gilbert?"

Danica instinctively moved to shield Brinley, but Hannah stepped in, shoving Brinley forward with an icy glare. "She's the one you're looking for."

Brinley stumbled straight into the police officers'path "You're under suspicion of disseminating explicit material and "You're under suspicion of disseminating explicit material and inciting violence. Come with us," one officer commanded,his voice sharp and unyielding. "Cuff her and escort her out!"

Brinley twisted in their grasp, desperately craning her neck toward Vincent, calling his name again and again.
a
But Vincent never looked up. He just stood there, transfixed by the divorce agreement trembling in his hands.

All around them, the guests whispered in shock as Brinley was led away in handcuffs, the spectacle searing itself into everyone's memory.

The Jones name had taken a vicious hit this day, the family's reputation in tatters.

All around the banquet hall, guests eyed Danica with barely disguised interest, their whispers slicing through her like knives.

Mortified, Danica let her humiliation morph into rage. She rounded on Hannah, shoving her hard. "This is all your fault!You ruined everything. Leave. You're not welcome here."

Her chest rose and fell with frantic anger as she snatched up a glass of wine, poised to drench Hannah.

But Hannah moved fast, seizing Danica's wrist and turning her hand with practiced ease. The wine sloshed out, splattering across Danica's dress and face, streaking her foundation and leaving her hair hanging in sticky clumps.

With a cool, razor-edged smile, Hannah clamped down on Danica's wrist, wringing a sharp yelp from her.

"In a hurry to make a scene, are you? Too bad-I'm not done with you." Hannah's gaze cut into Danica, voice dropping to a dangerous hush. "Tell me-did Brinley give you a document with my fingerprint on it? Something connected to those ten properties?"Danica's eyes darted away, but she tried to sound defiant, even as Hannah's grip tightened. "I have no idea what you're talking about. Let me go!"

Hannah tightened her grip just a little more, voice crisp and cold. "Playing dumb, are you? Let me spell it out for you.The document Brinley had me fingerprint has no legal standing-those ten properties still belong to me."

With a sudden shove, Hannah let go, sending Danica staggering into the edge of a side table, rattling the glassware.

Danica, flustered, fired back without thinking, "Impossible! It's all right there-black and white-the ten properties you signed over are mine again!"

A slow, dangerous smile crept onto Hannah's lips.′′SOyou finally admit it. You were in on Brinley's scheme to abduct me,weren't you?"

Danica's bravado faded, her eyes flickering with panic. She'd only wanted her properties back-maybe she'd heard Brinley had shady ideas, but she'd never asked for details and never thought it would go this far.

Her voice wobbled as she tried to deflect. "I swear, I didn't know. Brinley kept me in the dark-this was all her plan!"

Hannah shot her a frosty, disdainful smile. "You are such a moron. How could a contract signed while | was unconscious be valid? After all your plotting with Brinley, those ten properties you gifted me still belong to me."

Danica faltered, her words drying up mid-sentence.

Vincent's voice sliced through the tension. "What properties are you talking about?"

Hannah flicked a contemptuous glance his way. "The compensation your mother provided for me to leave you." Vincent's gaze swung to Danica, catching her as she quickly looked away, unease painted across her face.

Hannah was done. The ache in her body had grown unbearable,and her patience was gone. She turned to leave, determined to escape the toxic scene.

But Vincent stepped in front of her, cutting off her escape."You're only divorcing me because my mother forced you, isn't that right?"

Hannah didn't hesitate. "That's not it."

His confident mask slipped for a moment.

She moved to brush past him, but Vincent refused to let her go,blocking her way with tense, stubborn shoulders. "How are you planning to explain this to my grandma?" His tone was clipped,demanding.

Hannah's gaze was unreadable, her voice cold and flat. "I'll just tell her the truth."

Vincent's lips curled with a bitter sneer. "The truth? That you cheated? She'd be livid." His voice was edged with a dangerous bite.

Exasperated, Hannah pressed her fingers to the bridge of her nose. "Then I'll tell her we simply grew tired of each other.That we both fell for someone else."

Vincent shot back instantly, a raw edge in his voice, "I haven't fallen for anyone else."

Hannah gave a short, disbelieving laugh. "Oh, come on,Vincent. I know all about you and Brinley. What's the point in pretending, when you're practically engaged to her already?"

Vincent advanced, his features shadowed with frustration."Who told you I'm getting engaged to Brinley?" She edged away, every muscle tense. "Your mother didn't exactly keep it a secret-she announced it to the whole party.Don't tell me you had no clue."

A flicker of barely-contained fury crossed Vincent's face as he shot Danica a glare. "No one told me. There's nothing between Brinley and me, and I've told you that again and again."

Hannah's lips curled into a cold smile. "I believe what I see.I saw those cozy photos of you and Brinley myself. Don't tell me those were photoshopped." She scoffed, a spark of bitter amusement in her eyes. "You spend all your time accusing me of cheating, but it was you who'd strayed first."

Vincent's chest tightened, words catching in his throat.

"I'll explain everything to Sharon myself," Hannah said, stepping cleanly around him, refusing to meet his eyes. She strode toward the doors where Rena stood waiting, her posture unyielding. "We'll finalize the divorce tomorrow."
###Chapter 118 Can't I Stay The Night


One by one, the guests trickled out afer Hannah's departure, their curiosity barely masked behind polite farewells. What they'd witnessed tonight would keep tongues wagging for weeks.

Inside the house, staff swept through the rooms, clearing glasses and quieting chaos, while Vincent stood motionless, as if turned to stone.

Danica stepped closer and tugged gently at his sleeve. "Vincent, they took Brinley in. She's at the police station. Don't you think you should check on her? She's completely alone."

He turned on her, his tone sharp and cold. "Is this what you wanted? Hannah and l-it's over. The divorce is coming."

Danica faltered, her voice catching before she found it again. "Everything I did was for your own good.Hannah was never a match. Her background is just too ordinary. You deserve better."

With each word, her confidence swelled, justifying her choices."|fyour grandmother hadn't insisted on that marriage, I would've never let someone like Hannah marry into our family."

Vincent said nothing.

She softened her voice, hoping it would reach him. "Divorcing Hannah is the right choice. There are plenty of women out there better than her. Brinley, for one-you two go way back."

Vincent gave her a look that made her take a step back. "How many times do I have to say it? I don't like Brinley. You seem so fond of her. Maybe you should marry her instead of urging me to."

Danica stared at him, stunned. "Vincent, how can you speak to me like that..."

Vincent didn't let her finish. "Stay out of my business from now on."

Danica opened her mouth to argue, but he was already moving, taking the stairstwo at a time and vanishing from view before she could say a word. Left behind with her thoughts, she called out after him, "The police took Brinley. You need to do something about it-fast."

Vincent offered no reply.


***

Hannah was escorted back to her apartment in Sterling Heights by Rena.

Throwing a party had been Rena's original plan, a celebration of single life, but Hannah's injuries changed her mind.

Stepping into the elevator, Rena filled the silence with grumbles about Vincent, her words sharp with resentment.

The elevator doors slid open with a soft chime. Heated in their conversation, they stepped out, clueless about the wrong floor, and stopped cold at the sight greeting them.

Miles stood at his door, which was ajar, with his cat batting at the threshold. A young woman leaned in close, rising on her toes, trying to steal a kiss.

Miles pulled back, which sent her-off balance and nearly into his chest. He caught her with one hand-not gently-and held her back. "It's late. You should go."

"But can't I stay the night?" she asked, tilting her head. "If I go now, your sister's going to blame you."

"Please leave," Miles said, his tone turning to ice.

With a huff and a sharp stomp, the woman spun on her heel and walked off.

That was when Hannah blinked out of her daze and reached for Rena's arm, urging her back toward the elevator.

Just then, the cat looked their way, let out a high-pitched meow, and darted straight for them.

Miles had already noticed them. His voice carried across the hallway. "Didn't know you took up spying, Ms.Scott." Caught off guard, Hannah stumbled over her words. "I... I didn't mean to.I got off on the wrong floor."

His expression clouded. "Snowball, get over here."

The cat, completely ignoring him, rubbed affectionately against Hannah's legs.

Recalling his allergy to cat fur, Hannah gently picked the cat up and started toward the door with careful steps, placing the white cat at the doorway.

Once the kitten walked back inside the house, the door slammed shut in her face, making her flinch.

Without missing a beat, Rena tugged Hannah into apartment 2201 and shut the door behind them.

Once inside, Rena exhaled and leaned back against the wall. "That was intense. What are the odds Miles lives in the same building?"

"Didn't see that coming, either," Hannah murmured, sinking onto the couch andrubbing her temple."1"m meeting with Vincent tomorrow to finalize the divorce. I want it clean-no last-minute drama."

Without another word, she unlocked her phone and tapped out a message to Vincent.

Propping her chin in her palm, Rena studied Hannah with narrowed eyes. "You seem to have changed these days."

That made Hannah glance up, curious. "What do you mean?"

"There was a time when your whole world orbited around Vincent. I'm serious-you were completely wrapped up in him. I came over thinking I'd need to pick up the pieces, but here you are, not a trace of heartbreak."

Although the banquet incident lingered in the back of her mind, Rena kept her questions to herself, not wanting to reopen any fresh wounds. Hannah's composure, though, settled her nerves.

A soft smile touched Hannah's lips. "I've outgrown all that. I'm not all about love anymore. Ending things with Vincent isn't the end of me-it's the start of something better."

"That's the spirit. I'm truly happy for you," Rena said as she pulled Hannah into a hug, warmthvoice.
###Chapter 119 You Did This On Purpose, Didn't You


Upstairs in the Jones estate, Vincent dismissed the bodyguards with a clipped order to deliver the four kidnappers to the police station. Alone now, he drifted into the guest bedroom where Hannah had been staying.

He couldn't explain what drew him here. The space felt untouched. Only a handful of dresses hung in the closet, each one carefully spaced apart, proof that Hannah had never intended a long stay. She really had been living here like a guest.

Reaching into his pocket, Vincent pulled out a cigarette and lit it. The first inhale scorched his lungs and triggered a rough cough. Acrid smoke curled across his tongue, leaving behind a bitterness that did nothing to soothe the storm churning inside him.

Sleep had evaded him entirely the whole night. His mind refused to rest, tangled with questions he couldn't untangle.

By morning, his Bentley idled in front of the courthouse. He arrived on time, nine sharp, just as they'd agreed.But Hannah was nowhere in sight.

He didn't bother to call. Instead, he waited, silent and motionless, letting the minutes drag by.

Only at half past eleven did Hannah finally appear, walking up the courthouse steps alone.

Vincent climbed out of the car the instant he spotted her and strode over, tension etched into his posture.

Hannah was dressed in a scarlet dress, her makeup flawless, radiating an almost carefree allure that stung him more than he cared to admit.

A shadow crossed his features. Was she honestly this thrilled to be rid of him? "I've been waiting here forever," he muttered, his voice tight. "You said nine. It's eleven-thirty."

His irritation hovered just below the surface, but Hannah met it with a calm, dismissive smile. "I lost track of how many times I waited for you these past five years. Consider this payback."
With that, she pivoted smoothly and strode for the courthouse doors. "Let's go."

Vincent trailed after her, his footsteps heavy, the distance between them feeling wider than ever.

As soon as Hannah stepped inside, her heart sank at the sight of the snaking line winding through the family law clerk's office.

A restless night of chasing nightmares had left her bleary-eyed and hollow, with dawn creeping in before she finally drifted off. Morning had slipped through her fingers before she even managed to drag herself out of bed. If she'd known it would turn out like this, she might've just powered through the night without bothering to sleep at all.

Vincent arrived a short while later, his gaze immediately darkening when he spotted the crowd. He didn't hesitate-just turned on his heel, intent on making a quick departure.

Hannah reached out and caught his arm, holding him in place. "Where do you think you're going?"

He shot her a scowl. "There are way too many people. I can't stand waiting in lines."

She exhaled sharply, forcing herself to stay calm. "Just find a place to sit down and wait. I'll let you know when it's our turn-but don't wander off."

They were already at the courthouse-she refused to let anything stall this any longer.

Vincent said nothing but stayed close by.

A cheerful clerk ambled over and remarked, "Excuse me-this line's for divorces. If you're here for a marriage certificate, the city hall is several miles away."

"We're in the right place," Hannah replied, her tone brisk. "Divorce."

Vincent offered no response, his jaw set, gaze fixed somewhere in the middle distance.

The clerk nodded, apologizing before drifting away, but not before muttering, "She's dressed so nicely.I thought they were getting married."

Hannah's and Vincent's eyes met for a fleeting moment-a spark of shared discomfort-and both

Moments slipped by slowly. The line barely budged. At last, after four numbing hours, their number was called.

After confirming that both parties agreed to divorce willingly, the clerk asked them to present their documents.

Hannah reached into her bag and produced her driver's certificate, the marriage certificate, and the signed divorce agreement, placing them neatly on the counter.

Vincent remained motionless, hands buried in his pockets, making no move to cooperate.

The clerk fixed him with a polite but pointed look. "Sir, do you bring your documents?"

Vincent's answer was blunt, his tone devoid of remorse. "Nope."

Hannah stared at him in disbelief, abruptly rising from her seat. "What? You didn't bring anything?"

With a lazy roll of his shoulders, Vincent looked entirely unbothered. "I've never gotten divorced before.How was I supposed to know I needed to bring anything?"

Hannah stared at him, nearly speechless. "You had to bring documents to register the marriage, right? Why would the divorce be any different?"

He met her gaze, his voice steady. "You handled all the paperwork when we got married."

She let his comment roll off her back and addressed the clerk instead, "He's already signed the divorce agreement, and he's standing right here. We've waited in this line for four hours-can't wve just file now and bring the rest of the required documents later?"

Vincent watched her in silence, his eyes clouded with something unreadable.

The clerk offered a practiced, regretful smile. "I'm sorry, ma'am, but those are the rules. We need every document at the time of filing-no exceptions."

Five minutes later, Vincent and Hannah stepped back out onto the courthouse steps, the weight of wasted hours heavy on their shoulders.

Hannah's patience finally snapped. She spun toward Vincent, frustration crackling in her voice. "You did this on purpose, didn't you?"
###Chapter 120 Post-BreakupCompensation

Vincent came to a sudden halt and fixed Hannah with a cold glare. "Do you really believe that I, as the CEO,wasted around six hours of my day just to mess up our divorce on purpose? You think I've got nothing better to do?"

Hannah didn't hesitate and snapped right back at him, her words sharp, "Well, thank you for clearing your schedule for our much-wanted divorce. Anyway,same plan for tomorrow-nine a.m. at the courthouse."

She wanted the divorce finalized as soon as possible.

Vincent forced a stiff smile. "Can't. I've got a packed schedule tomorrow."

Hannah's lips pressed together. "How about the day after?" "Still can't do it," he replied, not even pausing to think.

Her patience began to fray. "When are you available,then?"

Vincent replied casually, "I'm tied up all week. Today was the only window I had."

A scowl appeared on her face. "Fine. Then just send Derek in your place."

He shot her a look of disbelief. "Have you lost your mind? I was the one who married you, not my assistant. You expect him to sign off on our divorce?"

Hannah shot up one eyebrow and kept her voice cold."Why not? You've had him do everything else-might as well have him handle the divorce,too."

She hadn't forgotten that he'd had Derek pick up her parents with her and deliver gifts to her parents. And Derek always informed her why Vincent wasn't coming home yet again. Frankly, it felt like she had married Derek,not Vincent.  Vincent's expression clouded over. "Absolutely not.End of discussion."

She shrugged and replied, "Anyway, I'll keep urging you every single day until we finalize the divorce."

The divorce issue was out in the open now. She wasn't going to drag it out with Vincent any longer.

She started to walk away, but he moved quickly,reaching out and taking hold of her wrist. "We need to talk."

Her voice was flat as she answered, "There's nothing left to talk about."

She figured that everything that needed to be said had been said yesterday.

She tried to pull her hand back, but he only tightened his grip. Without another word, he pulled her toward his car and opened the door,practically shoving her inside before hopping in himself and locking it behind them.Arms folded and eyes cold, she stared at him."Get to the point. I have other things to do."

Vincent struggled to keep his emotions in check."Let's decide how to break our divorce news to my grandmother."

"Alright," Hannah replied, her voice giving nothing away.

Eyes darkened slightly, he remarked, "The divorce agreement never spelled out how we'll split the assets.We need to make it official."

She shook her head. "That won't be necessary.Your mom's ten properties cover more than enough."

His brows knit together, and he wondered if she had been hoping for something else. "Take the Lakeshore Villa as well."

That villa was the first place they called home after the wedding. It had memories tied to it.

But she only shook her head again. "I already sold it and turned it into cash. You've transferred it to me a while back." He tried again. "What about a sports car?" The sports car he ordered Derek to pick out for her had yet to be delivered.

She barely glanced his way. "I'm not interested. That kind of thing doesn't suit me."

There was something about her coldness that got under his skin, though he couldn't put a name to it.He loosened his tie and popped open the top few buttons of his shirt. He let out a sigh. "Tell me, what exactly do you want?"

Hannah met his eyes, a flicker of mockery dancing in hers. "Oh? Is that your attempt at making it up to me?"

Vincent had no reply.

"You really are a fan of post-breakup compensation,huh?"

She offered a cold, dismissive smile. "I don't need it.I don't even want you anymore-why would I care about your things?"Without wasting another second, she unlocked the door and stepped out, never glancing back.

On instinct, Vincent reached out, hoping to catch her hand. He only managed to graze the edge of her red dress. The fabric slipped away, light as air, gone before he could close his hand around it.

Left in the car, he watched the envelope on the back seat through the rearview mirror. The truth was, he'd brought all the required paperwork. Yet, seeing her show up made something inside him freeze. He just couldn't bring himself to go through with the divorce.It could have been tied to his grandmother, or maybe it was that uneasy feeling stirring in his chest, the kind he wasn't ready to examine too closely
###Chapter 121 Were Those Wedding Favors


At the Jones Group headquarters, Vincent strode into the lobby just as the workday ended, the tension radiating off him in waves.

The secretarial office instantly fell silent. Not a single employee dared meet his eyes, much less greet him.

The air buzzed with gossip. Word of what had happened at Sharon's birthday banquet had rippled through the building. The press might've kept quiet, but every corridor crackled with speculation.

The most outrageous rumor making the rounds? Hannah-long pegged as Vincent's mistress-was actually his legal wife. Meanwhile, Brinley, once expected to marry him soon, was nothing but the bold and shameless other woman all along.

Many employees found the story believable. Especially the secretaries, who'd watched Hannah come and go from the CEO's office for weeks a few years ago. It all added up now-she'd simply been visiting her husband in plain sight.

Clive, ever skeptical, rolled his eyes at their whispered theories. People were letting their imaginations run wild. Anyone who'd witnessed how cold Vincent was to Hannah would never believe she was his wife. His focus had always been on Brinley.

The memory of that day when Brinley collapsed was still fresh-Vincent had swept her up in his arms and carried her straight to the ER, his concern written all over his face. If that wasn't love, what was?

Believing he knew the truth better than anyone, Clive let the office whispers fade without challenge. He knew exactly where Vincent's heart lay. As far as he was concerned, Brinley would eventually marry Vincent.

With that thought, Clive picked up the newly resized wedding ring and strode to Vincent's office,knocking on the door with calm confidence.

Vincent didn't bother looking up from his paperwork."What is it?"

Clive waved the small velvet box in his hand. "The ring you asked to have resized is ready, Mr. Jones."Without looking up, Vincent offered a curt nod. "Just leave it."

Setting the box gently on the edge of the desk, Clive slipped out of the room.

Left alone, Vincent reached for the ring box and flicked it open. For a moment, he simply stared, almost surprised by its presence-he'd nearly let it slip from his mind. The ring had been meant as a peace offering for Hannah. Now, staring at it, he could only wonder what purpose it served anymore.

With a sharp snap, he shut the box and shoved it aside. A prickling frustration crawled beneath his skin,restless and insistent.

He glared at the mountain of reports scattered across his desk, but the lines and numbers bled into each other, refusing to make sense.

Pushing himself to his feet, he propped a shoulder against the edge of the desk and stared out at the city,hoping the glass would absorb some of his tension.

Suddenly, a burst of noise erupted in the hallway. He caught the unmistakable lilt of Rena's voice threading through the chatter.

Outside his office, the staff had gathered, offering Rena their congratulations.

Rena gave them a sly smile and remarked, "Oh, the celebration is not for me. It's for my best friend."

The air buzzed with well-wishes, right up until Rena dropped her bombshell. "She is getting her divorce.Isn't that something to celebrate?"

A hush swept over the group-then came a few nervous laughs, no one quite sure how to react.

Rena breezed through the crowd, handing out pastel-colored candy bags as if she were tossing out wedding favors.

Grabbing a handful of pastel-colored candies, she made a beeline for Vincent's office. Then, without so much as a knock, she swung open the door and stopped at the doorway. "Good afternoon, Mr. Jones."

Vincent shot her a languid look and slowly turned around."SOyour father still can't keep you in line, even after last time's disaster at the event?"She clenched her fists. He actually had the nerve to bring up the gala? She'd been stuck at home for days thanks to him-and that was precisely why she'd shown up today, to get under his skin.

Rena's lips curled into a sly smile as she gave the open door a few light taps for show. "Mr. Jones, I am here to drop off some documents."

Vincent arched an eyebrow, tone dripping with sarcasm. "The Brown Bank heiress running errands for once?That's a surprise."

She grinned, unbothered. "I'm multitasking, Mr. Jones. Paperwork's just part of it." With a flourish, she tossed a small bag of pastel candies onto his desk. "Here's the real reason I stopped by."

She leaned closer, drawing out every syllable. "On behalf of Hannah."

All trace of amusement vanished from Vincent's face. "What's that supposed to mean?" Were those wedding favors?
###Chapter 122 Not Mrs. Jones Anymore


Vincent clenched his fists. No wonder Hannah had pushed so hard to get the divorce finalized today-she'd been planning to marry Felix afterwards all along. Without that official divorce decree, how could she possibly marry someone else?

Vincent's jaw tightened, his whole demeanor turning icy as anger flickered in his eyes. "Hannah sent you?"His voice dropped to a frigid, cutting whisper.

"Of course not," Rena retorted, her tone quick and dismissive. "If you actually understood Hannah at all,you'd know she'd never send me to deal with you."

She watched his expression darken, a smirk dancing on her lips as she soaked in his displeasure. "I'm just here to celebrate your split and her upcoming freedom," she went on, tone light and irreverent. "Figured I'd bring you something sweet to mark the occasion."

Vincent's brow furrowed, disbelief coloring his voice. "You seriously thought a divorce is worth celebrating?"

Rena gave a casual shrug, completely unbothered. "Why not? Leaving you is too much of a good news to pass around sweets."

Vincent frowned, wondering whether Hannah wasn't intent on marrying Felix. He kept his expression locked in place, though his thoughts raced in a frenzy. His voice dropped, cold and sharp."Get out."

Rena flashed a triumphant smile as she shot back, "Gladly." She pivoted toward the door, clearly savoring the effect she'd had on him.

But just as her hand touched the handle, he called out, stopping her in her tracks.

She spun back, irritation in her voice. "What is it now?"

"Last night, did she stay with you?" His words came out clipped, brittle with tension. Rena squared her shoulders, her reply ringing with satisfaction. "Of course, she did. She looked a whole lot happier with me than she ever did with you."

He gave a curt nod. "Fine.You can leave."

Rena tossed out a muttered curse as she strode away, her heels tapping a quick rhythm down the hall.

The moment the door closed behind her, Vincent felt the tension in his muscles start to unravel. It seemed Hannah wasn't about to marry Felix, or Rena would've dropped the news aIready.

His gaze drifted back to the velvet box containing the pair of wedding rings on his desk. If Hannah would just admit she'd made a mistake, he was open to the option of continuing their marriage. After all, they had once lived happily together, and his grandmother adored her. Forgiveness wasn't impossible. He wouldn't mind making up for ever ignoring her feelings if it meant she would drop the idea of a divorce.

···
Down at the police station, Brinley had spent three full days locked in a holding cell, watching the hours crawl by. Vincent hadn't visited. He hadn't even bothered to answer her calls.

She couldn't risk faking an illness-jail was terrifying, but getting caught in a lie would be even worse.All she could do was sit tight, counting on Vincent to bail her out. She knew him well enough over the years. He might be furious now, but he always forgave her eventually. He wouldn't actually abandon her in a place like this.

But when the fourth day arrived, the person who came wasn't Vincent.

After parting ways with Vincent at the entrance of the courthouse, Hannah headed straight to the police station. The authorities had finally apprehended the four men responsible for her abduction, and she had come to formally identify them.

Once Hannah finished giving her statement, she noticed Brinley lingering nearby and caught sight of Derek emerging from the back office, clutching a thick stack of paperwork. A furrow appeared between her brows as she strode over to Derek. "Did Vincent send you here to get Brinley?"
 
Brinley provoked Hannah with a smug look. Derek replied honestly, "Yes, Mrs. Jones."

Brinley interjected instantly, her tone sharp, "Derek, she's not 'Mrs. Jones' anymore. You should get used to that."

Derek froze, looking utterly awkward, the words catching in his throat.

Hannah kept her voice steady. "She's right. I'm not his wife anymnore. Just call me by my name."

Derek replied with a nod, correcting himself with stiff formality, "Understood,Ms. Scott."

Brinley's smug grin grew even wider.

Without sparing Brinley a glance, Hannah addressed the officer handling the release, "Isn't there enough evidence against Brinley? Why is she walking free?"

The officer,who hadn't forgotten the details of the case, answered immediately, "Miss Gilbert's role couldn't be established. The four suspects alI gave the same story-they said they'd never met her and insisted the kidnapping was a spur-of-the-moment decision."

A chill crept into Hannah's eyes. "That's not possible. I have a recording-proof that she was behind everything."

The officer shook his head. "You mean the audio you submitted? None of the suspects, including Miss Gilbert, admitted it was real. Without their confirmation, we can't use it as evidence."

Hannah's gut twisted as she pressed. "What about the fake video she made?"

"We checked her phone. There's no such file-nothing we can use in court," the officer swiftly explained.

Brinley folded her arms, her lips curving in a wintry smirk. "I'm innocent. You heard the officer. Quit pestering them."

Hannah shot Brinley a glare as sharp as ice. Those words from the officer were enough for her to figure out the situation. Vincent had orchestrated the four suspects' statements, all to shield Brinley from blame.Brinley had only been in holding for three days, yet Vincent was already scrambling to get her released. "You two deserve each other." Hannah scoffed, her voice unexpectedly sharp.

Brinley blinked in confusion. "What did you say?"

Hannah met her gaze, eyes like cold glass. "I said, you and Vincent make the perfect pair. You really should stay together-for life." Her tone turned icy as she added, "That way, you won't get the chance to ruin anyone else's happiness."
Without waiting for a reply, Hannah pivoted and strode away, refusing to give Brinley another glance.It was a strange comfort, knowing she would soon secure a divorce decree and cut all ties with Vincent.
###Chapter 123 Moving To A New Office


After concluding the documentation at the police station, Derek headed straight to the Jones Group headquarters to retrieve Vincent.

Vincent had worked unusually late that night-by the time he exited the office, it was nearing 11 p.m. He walked to the waiting car. Because the lighting inside the car was low, he didn't instantly realize there was someone already occupying the back seat.

"Vincent!" Brinley's tone pierced the silence from the rear, making him flinch.

He scowled. "You're out of custody-why didn't you head home?"

"I just needed to say thank you face-to-face," she murmured with softness. "If not for you, l'd still be stuck behind bars."

She angled closer with a tender grin. Vincent shoved her aside without hesitation. "You believe I'm unaware of the situation?"

Brinley's eyes flooded in an instant. "I'm sorry, alright? | know I screwed everything up."

Vincent's features contorted with rage as he barked, "You nearly got Hannah killed!"

"That wasn't what I wanted," she said hastily. "All I aimed for was to assist your mother in reclaiming those estates. I never instructed those men to assault her-that part wasn't me!"

"Still lying?" he snarled.

"I'm telling the truth!" she insisted, a bit too sharply.

Vincent massaged the space between his eyes. "You're grounded for the next few days. Reflect on your own doings. No chaos. No stunts."

He turned to face the window, voice dropping. "Brinley, your father and brother would hate to see the person you've turned into."

Without continuing, Vincent climbed out of the car."Take her back," he ordered Derek and then walked off.

"Understood."

That evening, Vincent didn't return to the Jones estate. Instead, he stayed in a unit not far from the office.He glanced at his phone-still nothing from Hannah.

He'd figured Hannah would've pressed him to finalize their divorce at the courthouse-but she didn't contact him at all. Perhaps that meant she wasn't that eager to walk away from him.

He expected as much. She had once loved him deeply. How could she possibly bring herself to end things with him? He would just wait and see how long she could hold back from contacting him.



Hannah had been buried in work lately. Her team had recently completed collecting user feedback reports for the hormone-monitoring wristband, and now her team had to absorb reasonable suggestions for system upgrades.

Having majored in computer science, Hannah spearheaded the enhancement of the detection algorithm.

By the fifth day, they had delivered version 3.0 of the wristband.

Before dispatching the units for a new testing cycle, Felix assembled their team of twenty-something members and proposed a celebratory outing.

Applause broke out immediately.

Hannah had an announcement of her own.

"What's the news? Is it about romance?"

"Wow! Who's the lucky guy?"

Once the joking began, the rest joined in, clearly entertained. They had all caught Felix's tender face
whenever he looked Hannah's way.

Exchanging a knowing look with Felix, Hannah spoke up with a laugh."|t′Snot romantic. We're relocating soon-to a far better space."

Excitement swept across the room again.

Felix turned her way, caught off guard. Even he hadn't known about this, and it genuinely delighted him.

"And," Hannah added, "what I know matters most to you all-advancements and bonuses. After version 3.0goes live, everyone here moves up one tier, with a salary raise. Double, in fact. Plus, once we're in the new space, we're expanding the team. That means lighter workloads for everybody."

The room erupted with celebration.

"Thank you, Ms. Scott, Mr.Wade!"

"This deserves a toast. Who's down for drinks tonight?"

The idea was met with loud approval.

Felix beamed and gave a nod.

Hannah couldn't help but grin at the collective excitement. Back when she rejoined the company, there had been whispers that she was just another connected hire. But working closely with her erased all doubt-she'd proven herself as a capable leader. There was something electric about striving toward a shared mission.

"How about we go secure a table first?" Felix stepped in and gave her shoulder a tap.

Hannah gave a nod.

While they walked out, he asked,"So where's the new location?"

She pulled out a clip on her phone. "It's a building near Cerulean Bay. I'll text you the location-it's already all arranged. That district's packed with industry giants."

Jones Group, VitraMind, and several more, had central offices in that zone. Ambition sparkled in Hannah's eyes. "Sooner or later, people are going to know our name too."
###Chapter 124 Spend The Night With Me


After reserving Private Room 09 at Obsidian Club, Hannah and Felix immediately called their teammates over.

Issac never expected to spot Hannah at this place. Lately, her name had been buzzing through their social circles-no longer just Vincent's rumored mistress, but allegedly his legal wife.

The story had grown so wild that people began stalking Jones Group's official channels, waiting for any hint of confirmation. Jones Group, of course, made no statement to respond to the rumors.

As far as Issac was concerned, that silence spoke volumes-the whole"Mrs. Jones" rumor was nothing but a joke.

Then, Issac's gaze drifted to the man beside Hannah, and realization dawned-they were still together. Now,that made the whole situation more interesting.

Within thirty minutes, Nova Tech's staff started pouring in. Soon, Felix and Hannah were leading a crowd of more than twenty employees through the club, ushering them toward the reserved private room.

Issac made his move at just the right moment. Pouring himself a generous glass of whiskey, he sauntered straight into the group's path as if the world belonged to him. He fixed his gaze on a timid woman with downcast eyes, then let his steps falter and"accidentally" doused himself in liquor, splattering the expensive suit.

"This suit cost me one million," he declared, catching the woman's wrist before she could retreat."How do you plan on making that up to me,sweetheart?"

The unlucky target-Sophie Hart from the UI team-froze, her face draining of color. She barely got the words out. "I... I didn't bump into you. You did it on purpose. It's not my fault."

Issac's grip grew firmer as he pressed on. "So you're telling me my drink just flew out of my hand all by itself? Don't kid yourself. Be an adult. Admit what you did."
Meanwhile,Felix and Hannah noticed the commotion and wasted no time approaching.

Hannah stepped between them, shielding Sophie. "What do you think you're doing?"

Issac flashed a mocking grin. "Well, well, if it isn't Vincent Jones's so-called wife. Been a while, Hannah."

At his words, heads turned, curiosity glinting in their eyes.

Felix quietly gathered the rest of the team and steered them into Room 09.

Unfazed by the sudden attention, Hannah met Issac's gaze with a frosty smile. "Shouldn't you be at the hospital? By now, your baby brother's probably arrived. Or did you come here to drown your sorrows?"

Issac gave a sharp, dismissive laugh. "You've got time to fuss over my family? Maybe start worrying about your own people first."

Issac flopped into a booth, legs crossed, and gestured at the mess on his suit. "See this? That girl behind you just soaked me. Since you're so eager to defend her, tell me-how are you planning to fix this?"

"I didn't do it!" Sophie blurted, voice trembling. "He bumped into me on purpose-he did it himself!"

Hannah didn't hesitate as she responded, "We believe you, Sophie."

Felix stepped up beside Hannah, his tone icy but measured. "Name your price. We'll cover whatever you claim the suit's worth."

Issac lounged back with a crooked, arrogant smile. "I'm not desperate for cash."

Hannah's patience was already thinning. She crossed her arms, her voice edged with ice. "Then stop playing games. Just spit it out. WNhat do you want?"

Issac's grin widened, lazy and predatory. He jabbed a finger toward her. "You. Spend the night with me."

Issac still hadn't forgotten the humiliation she'd served him last time-tonight, he intended to even the score.

Felix cut in before Hannah could answer, his expression stormy, "Not a chance in hell."
Issac smirked, tossing out a careless shrug. "Then how about the timid little mouse hiding behind you? She can keep me company instead." His finger jabbed straight at Sophie, who went pale, her whole body trembling.

The implication was clear as a slap. Hannah's eyes flashed dangerously.

A heavy silence stretched between them. Finally, Hannah exhaled, her jaw tight. "Fine. I'Il go with you."

Felix's face drained of color as he shook his head in protest, but Hannah only leaned close and murmured something low in his ear.
###Chapter 125 Taught Issac A Harsh Lesson


Inside the VIP lounge of the Obsidian Club, Vincent realized how long it had been since he last shared a drink with Bobby and the others.

Most nights, when Bobby called, Vincent always had an excuse to bail.

But tonight, inexplicably, Vincent showed up-and spent hours tossing back whiskey in moody silence.

The group could barely contain their curiosity about the swirling rumors. Since Bobby was closest to Vincent, all probing eyes fell on him, silently begging for an opening.

Bobby finally broke the tension, tapping his glass to Vincent's with a lopsided grin. "Hey, take it easy. Good liquor's for savoring, not drowning in."

Vincent's gaze was icy, slicing through the haze. "What gives you the right to lecture me about how I drink?"

Vincent's mood was unmistakably dark. Bobby, realizing he'd picked the wrong moment, fell silent and shrank back, his earlier bravado gone in a heartbeat.

A sudden laugh broke out from a man of the group, his gaze glued to his phone. "Well, look who's finally shooting his shot-Issac Stanley."

Bobby cocked an eyebrow, curiosity piqued. "What's Issac up to now?"

The man grinned, mischief in his eyes. "Apparently, he scored a date with Hannah Scott. Kinda wild,considering she shut him down hard the last time he tried."

He smirked, sneaking a glance across the lounge, clearly hoping to catch Vincent's reaction.

He didn't have to look far-Vincent had silently appeared at his shoulder, eyes narrowed on the glowing phone screen.

"What do you mean by that?" Vincent's voice was low, but the weight behind it made everyone freeze. The man fumbled, nearly dropping his phone in panic.

Vincent's stare grew even colder, the shadows sharpening the angles of his face. "I asked y/ou,what do you mean Issac Stanley has a date with her?"

"I don't know the details. Issac bragged about it himself in the group chat. Said he was at Obsidian Club...I think it's happening right here."

Bobby took one look at Vincent's dark expression and posed the question. "So it's true? You actually married Hannah, and now she's walking out on you?"

Bobby kicked himself for skipping Sharon's seventieth birthday party. Most of their group's parents had attended, and the wild rumors afterward were all hearsay-hard to believe. Like the one about "Hannah going from Vincent's long-term mistress to his wife." The whole thing sounded utterly absurd.

Vincent's jaw tightened, giving nothing away. "You're getting awfully nosy." He set down his glass with a dull clink, then pivoted and strode off.

Bobby watched him leave and then called out, "Done drinking already? Where're you heading off to?"

Vincent didn't bother looking back. "Restroom," he muttered with an even tone.

Bobby leaned in, lowering his voice with certainty. "He's not headed for the restroom. I guarantee it-he's on his way to find Hannah."

"Oh, come on-didn't he just say he was heading to the restroom?"

Shaking his head, Bobby remarked, "You don't get it. Vincent has a possessiveness over her that runs deeper than he realizes."

Bobby prided himself on his instincts when it came to matters of the heart. He remembered one particular night-Hannah drinking alone at a bar, Vincent nowhere in sight. Bobby had texted Vincent, barely finished the message before Vincent came charging in, wild-eyed and ready to start a fight at the first sign of anyone talking to her. Vincent simply couldn't stand seeing another guy anywhere near her.

··· Inside Issac's private room, it was only him and Hannah.

Issac angled his phone and snapped a picture of Hannah, the camera flash catching in her wary eyes.

She shot him a look, suspicion hardening her voice."What's that for?"

Issac barely looked up from his phone. "Isn't it obvious? Gotta show off a little." His fingers flew across the screen, grinning slyly.

Hannah twisted her lips into a sharp, mocking smile.

Issac popped the cap off a bottle of tequila, pouring generous shots into three waiting glasses. "Let's start with a few drinks to get things going," he suggested, his tone teasing.

He nudged a glass her way and remarked, "This one's yours."

Hannah answered with a cool, easy smile, "Sure. I'll drink first." She leaned in, fingers curling around the glass, bringing it just shy of her lips.

Issac's gaze burned with anticipation, every muscle tense as he watched her.

But before he could savor the moment, Hannah hurled the contents of her glass straight onto his face,drenching him in cold tequila.

Issac erupted in rage. "What the hell? Are you fucking insane?" he bellowed, alcohol dripping from his jaw and collar, humiliation burning across his cheeks.

He lunged at her, fingers grasping for her arm, but Hannah slipped out of reach with practiced ease.

"I don't take kindly to threats." Her tone was ice, every word slicing the air.

Her expression hardened into something letal. She slammed the empty glass onto the table's edge-sharp crack, fragments scattering. With effortless bravado, she plucked up a jagged shard and offered Issac a sly,dangerous grin.

After what had happened during the kidnapping, Hannah had learned one thing. To make it out alive, she had to outmatch her enemies, no matter how ruthless. She'd realized that appearing weak only encouraged people with malicious intentions to keep coming. And Issac-who was now harassing her for a second time -was the perfect case in point.

Issac's eyes locked on the shard in her grip, voice shaky as he started to edge away. "What on earth do you think you're doing?"

She tilted her head, never breaking eye contact. "What do you think? Giving you a little lesson."

She launched forward without warning, driving her foot straight into his stomach.

Issac crumpled onto the couch, clutching his stomach, barely able to catch his breath as Hannah pressed the jagged shard against his throat.

A frosty smile tugged at her lips. "Careful now. Try anything and I'll make sure you bleed."

Issac's entire body trembled. "You... If you lay a hand on me, my family will ruin you," he stammered, his words shaking as hard as his hands.

Hannah's voice cut through the air,icy and steady."Oh? But I am dead set on laying a hand on you.What are you going to do about it, Issac?"

She leaned in, the glass biting closer to his skin. Her words dropped to a venomous whisper."Do you really think your father would lift a finger to help you? He's been looking down on you. Always the disappointment,always the mess."

"You!" The words struck him dead-on. He was gasping for breath but didn't dare to move.

"I'll say this once. Stay the hell away from anyone I care about. Next time, it won't just be a drink in your face."

Issac had always assumed Hannah as harmless-a docile woman who'd never raise her voice, much less her hand. He never could have imagined this kind of rage simmering just beneath her surface. He'd read her all wrong.

Raised in luxury, Issac had beenshielded from real danger his entire life. Now, faced with a woman who refused to play victim, he was completely out of his depth.The fear was plain in his eyes as he stared at her, helplessly stammering, "Don't do anything reckless..."

His pitiful attempt at self-preservation only amused Hannah. Men like Issac thrived on picking apart the vulnerable, but the moment they encountered true defiance, their bravado melted away.

With an icy smile, Hannah lowered the jagged shard, using it to slice through the buttons on his shirt one by one. The glass tip wandered across his chest, leaving a trail of torn fabric and shallow scratches. He looked utterly disheveled-his dignity shredded along with his shirt. There would be no talking his way out of this.

A sudden crash broke the tension as the door swung open. Hannah's body relaxed, sure it was Felix bursting in.

She flung the shard aside and pivoted, only to recognize the figure in the doorway wasn't Felix at all.

###Chapter 126 You Are Still My Wife


A scowl formed on Hannah's face as she locked eyes with Vincent."Why are you here?" she demanded.

Vincent didn't answer and strode to Issac, his voice icy as he asked, "What did he do to you?"

Seeing Vincent looming above him, Issac shrank into the couch cushions. His shirt hung in tatters, rumpled and stretched out of shape. There was no doubt Hannah was the one who'd done something to him. Still, he didn't dare say a word.

"That's none of your concern," Hannah replied, her voice cold and clipped.

Before she could say anything else, Felix charged into the room with a swarm of reporters at his heels.

Hannah had laid out the plan for Felix in detail-bring the media here and let Edward Stanley, Issac's father,witness firsthand the chaos his precious son had created once again.

As the reporters barged in, Issac froze up, unable to move. Hannah calmly stepped to the side, clearing a path for them.

Whatever headlines tomorrow brought didn't matter to her. What truly mattered was that Edward would be furious, and this time, there'd be no hiding the scandal.

Felix spotted her in the chaos and wasted no time ushering her toward the door.

Vincent, meanwhile, stood motionless, his glare never leaving the two as they made their way out. From the moment Felix entered, Hannah hadn't looked at him once.

With Vincent standing so close to Issac, the reporters quickly swung their cameras in his direction. However,one warning glare from Vincent made them falter-the intensity in his eyes was enough to send a chill through the room.

They immediately shifted their attention back to Issac.

Expression dark,Vincent landed a sharp kick to Issac's leg and then sormed out without another word.
Once outside, Felix eyed Hannah, ready to check if she was hurt, but he hesitated and drew his hand back.Instead, his voice was gentle as he asked, "You alright?"

"I'm alright," Hannah said, waving off his concern. "Didn't expect you to get the reporters here so quickly."

"You're insane, you know that? Facing Issac alone like that..." Felix had spent the entire time nervously pacing back and forth outside the room. More than once, he'd nearly burst through the door, but his task of guiding the reporters inside the room kept him in check. Luckily, things hadn't spiraled out of control.

"I've had enough of Issac. Figured it was time he learned a lesson," Hannah replied with a careless shrug.After everything Issac had pulled, harassing her twice, treating her like an easy mark, she'd finally snapped.

"Let's get back to the lounge," she added, motioning for Felix to follow as she turned to leave.

Just as she was about to step forward, Felix stopped her, his eyes flickering toward Vincent nearby."Wai there's something on your lip," he murmured, concern slipping into his voice.

Felix reached out, one hand gently on her shoulder, the other inching toward her face. He leaned in a little,angling his head as if trying to get a better look in the dim light.

Hannah didn't think much of it-maybe the lighting was dim and he needed to get closer to see.

From a distance, it looked for all the world like he was about to kiss her.

A frosty voice shattered the moment. "What do you think you're doing?"

Before Hannah could process what was happening, Vincent closed the gap in a flash. He pulled Felix back and, without warning, delivered a hard punch right to his jaw.

Hannah's temnper flared. "Have you lost your mind?" She darted to Felix's side, kneeling beside him as blood trickled from his mouth-Vincent hadn't pulled his punch.

Vincent shot her a look, his eyes clouded with something dark. "So that hurt you more than him, huh?"

"I can't even stand to look at you right now. Get out of my sight!" She gave him a hard shove.

Something twisted sharply in Vincent's chest as he realized just how fiercely she was standing up for Felix.
Felix dabbed at the blood on his lip, his voice steady as he spoke. "Don't worry about me. After dealing with Mr. Jones for days, I've learned to expect the unexpected."

Vincent's words came out tight with fury. "Didn't I tell you to stay away from her?"

Vincent was livid. Despite the warning, Felix had crossed that line. He'd gotten close to Hannah and made her pregnant with his child. And then she lost the baby. Compared to what Felix dleserved, a single punch was barely anything.

Felix ignored Vincent. Instead, he glanced at Hannah, his tone softening.′′My lip's stinging a bit. Could you help me clean it up?"

Concern flickered across Hannah's face. "Of course."

That sight made Vincent's expression cloud over even more.

She reached for Felix, trying to guide him past Vincent, but Vincent stepped in front of her, blocking her way.

"You're not leaving," Vincent said, his voice rough but his gaze focused on Felix. his voice rough but his gaze focused on Felix.

"That's not your call. Our marriage is over," she replied, her words cool and determined.

"We're not done yet," Vincent shot back, a bitter laugh slipping out.′′On paper, you're still my wife."

"The divorce agreement is signed," Hannah retorted, her tone turning glacial. "There's nothing left between us."

Vincent only stared at her, stubbornly holding his ground in the narrow hallway.

Hannah fixed Vincent with a glare. "Get out of my way." Then, she let go of Felix's hand and stepped forward,determined to push Vincent aside.

Vincent's hand shot out, gripping her wrist."No."

Finding no way to escape his grip, she suddenly ducked her head and sank her teeth into his wrist, biting down with all her strength.
###Chapter 127 I Don't Forgive You


Hannah bit down hard enough to draw blood, but Vincent's grip refused to loosen. She eventually eased the tension from her teeth.

Felix advanced to her side. "Mr. Jones, your marriage is over. Stop holding on. She doesn't want this."

Vincent tossed him an icy, sardonic glare. "Don't pretend you understand her. This is a matter between my wife and me. What gives you the right to speak?"

Just recalling the moment Felix kissed Hannah ignited fury within Vincent. She belonged with him. How could she let someone else near her?

Hannah scowled. "I'm telling you, Felix said the truth.I never-"

Defending again. For Felix. Before she got to the end, Vincent abruptly seized her neck and crushed his mouth to hers, all while glaring at Felix like staking a claim.

Hannah's eyes widened in terror, thrashing against him with everything she had.

Felix went rigid, face morphing from stunned to seething. He was just about to act when Hannah suddenly made an unexpected move.

Smack! The sound of her slap on Vincent's cheek rang loud in the hallway.

Vincent barely flinched, just swiped his tongue across his lips and stared blankly at her.

Hannah inhaled deeply,steadying her breath."Do you even realize what you're doing? We're divorced!"

"We haven't secured the divorce decree!" he shot back. "That's still binding."

Silence settled between them.

Hannah had no desire to argue. She made a move to walk past Vincent, but his voice cut through again."I forgive you."
She whirled, stunned. "Forgive me? For what, exactly?"

Vincent's voice was low as he pointed at Felix. "For being with him. I've chosen to forgive."

Felix looked toward her, puzzled.

Vincent continued, voice flat, "As long as you keep your distance from Felix, we can choose not to go through the divorce. We can go back to how things were." The thought of her touching someone else drove him insane. It haunted him.

Hannah let out a sharp, frosty laugh."What makes you think I'd ever want to continue to live with you?"

Vincent shot up one eyebrow. "You regret this, don't you?" She had gone five whole days without urging him to finalize the divorce. That silence screamed hesitation.

Hannah's gaze sharpened. "You're absolutely right-I do regret it."

Hope sparked in Vincent's eyes. He moved closer, a faint smile on his lips. He knew it. She still couldn't let go.

Her palm rose, halting him from getting any closer. She retreated several steps. "I regret not arriving sooner to submit the divorce files. Had I not been late, we could've retrieved the missing pages and submitted them -everything would've been finalized that same day."

It felt like concrete had dropped onto Vincent's chest, crushing the air from his lungs. She must be saying so just to wound him.

Hannah gave him a steady look. "And just so we're clear-I don't forgive you." A direct counter to his earlier declaration.

A sharp,twisting pain spread through Vincent's chest. He couldn't get a single word out.

After the barrage of words, Hannah felt nothing but drained. She faced Felix. "Let's leave."

"Alright."

But as she moved forward, Vincent's hand caught her wrist again. He asked, "That day at the courthouse- did you show up late on purpose? Were you stalling?"

Facing away, Hannah's reply was detached. "You're reading too much into it. I barely got any sleep because of the injuries. I woke up late. And how I got hurt... Isn't that something you already know?"

Vincent stood frozen, eyes locked on her fading silhouette. He wanted to chase-but his feet wouldn't budge. All that echoed in his mind was the coldness on Hannah's face, and it struck him anew-Hannah was truly walking away from him.
###Chapter 128 | Used You


Hannah and Felix walked together, keeping a steady pace down the corridor.

As they moved along, she noticed several VIP suites left wide open, like someone had barged through in a hurry..

A few steps ahead, the owner of the Obsidian Club was muttering complaints to an employee, "Mr. Jones just started storming through rooms without a word. I have no idea who he's searching for, but now half our important guests are furious."

Now the owner had to personally apologize to each VIP, hoping to calm things down.

None of that mattered to Hannah. Vincent's business was the last thing on her mind.

When they reached their private room, Felix gently caught her by the hand. "Can we talk for a minute?"

Hannah understood the reason behind his request for a talk. Given everything that had unfolded, he'd surely pieced together parts of the truth. She owed him a real explanation for using him the way she had.

"Let's get some fresh air," she suggested.

Outside, the night breeze felt cool and grounding as they stepped away from the noise of the club.

Neither of them spoke for a while, a quiet tension hanging in the air. Hannah fumbled for the right words,unsure how to begin.

It was Felix who finally broke the silence, his tone gentle. "You're awfully quiet."

Lifting her gaze, Hannah met his eyes, her expression sincere. "Felix, I owe you an apology.I used you."

She laid everything out for him, with no attempts to dodge the truth.

"At the birthday banquet, things got out of hand. Brinley showed up with some bogus medical report, saying I'd lost a baby and cheated on Vincent-that the child was yours. Vincent bought the lie. I tried to reason with him, but nothing got through, and honestly, I was too furious to try. So I let him believe whatever he wanted. I guess seeing you only made things worse for him, which explains why he's had it out for you all this time."

"So that's what was really going on." Felix let out a small smile, a flicker of hope warming his chest. The fact that she'd confided in him suggested her trust in him.

"It was Vincent's baby, right?" His voice was quiet, but he already knew the truth.

Hannah confirmed it with a nod, her mind drifting back for a moment to the hurt in Vincent's eyes-the way he never truly believed her. She forced herself to push the memory away and let out a long breath. "I figured you'd be angry."

Felix hesitated and then answered,"|was."

Her face fell, and he rushed to explain, "I just wish you'd trusted me enough to tell me sooner."

A weak laugh escaped her lips. "Guess it's better late than never."

Felix swallowed hard, searching her eyes.11SO1, what are you going to do to make it up to me?"

She didn't miss a beat. "I'll buy you dinner?"

He shook his head, grinning. "Not good enough. Take me somewhere fun, something that feels like a getaway."

The request wwas heavy with his ulterior motives, and he knew it, but he couldn't help hoping she'd agree.

"Alright, you're on," Hannah replied without hesitation.

Felix looked away, hiding a wistful smile. Deep down, a small part of him wished Vincent's assumptions were reality, and that Hannah and he really had something going on.

...

Five days had passed without any sign of Vincent at the Jones family estate. Brinley was beside herself with worry,constantly pressuring Danica to lure him back. Danica had just reached for her phone to call Vincent when, out of the blue, someone escorted him home.

Bobby stepped through the door, and Danica immediately recognized him. He and Vincent had always managed to stay on good terms.

"Thank you for bringing Vincent home, Bobby," Danica said with a courteous nod.

"It's no problem, Mrs. Jones. He went a little overboard tonight-just make sure he drinks some honeyed water and gets plenty of rest," Bobby said, offering a reassuring smile as he guided Vincent to the couch.

As Bobby straightened, he spotted a woman hovering close to Vincent. That had to be Brinley Gilbert-the childhood sweetheart everyone talked about. She was living here now? That meant the whispers were real.Brinley and Vincent were seriously on the verge of getting engaged.

Wasting no time, Bobby double-checked that Vincent was settled and then quietly let himseIf out.

Vincent reeked of alcohol, but he wasn't the belligerent type when drunk. Once he was out, he stayed quiet.

Danica shot Brinley a meaningful look and then nudged her gently. "I'll leave Vincent with you, Brinley."

Brinley caught the hint at once. "Don't worry. I'll make sure he's alright."

Now was her moment-an alone time with Vincent.

Brinley reached for his collar, about to undo a button, when Vincent suddenly jerked back and slapped her hand away. His tone was cold and cutting. "What do you think you're doing?"

Brinley flinched, surprise and disappointment flickering across her face before she hidit."1only meant to help. You looked uncomfortable, so I tried to fix your collar."

"I can handle it myself," Vincent replied, his voice flat.

He sat up with effort, feeling the weight of too many drinks. Ever since Hannah left, drinking had become a habit he couldn't shake. It hit him then where he was, back at the family estate. Without another word, he pushed to his feet and made his way upstairs.

"I'll help you," Brinley blurted out, rushing to catch up. Vincent, however, sidestepped her attempt.

Her hand hung in the air, and for a split second, she stood rooted in place, the rejection cutting deeper than she let on. Was he really still so bitter about everything that had happened? He wouldn't even let her get close.

Trying not to let her frustration show, she balled her hands into fists and reminded herself to stay patient.His divorce from Hannah was bound to happen. Sooner or later, the opportunity she wanted would come.There was no need to force things now.

Rather than returning to his bedroom, Vincent drifted down the hall and ended up in the guest room, the very one where Hannah used to sleep. Her scent still lingered on the linens. As soon as he lay down,exhaustion overwhelmed him, and he drifted off to sleep.

When morning arrived, Vincent woke to a throbbing headache.

Downstairs, the quiet clink of silverware greeted him. Danica and Brinley were already having breakfast together. Ever since Sharon left to visit a friend after the birthday fiasco, Danica had been enjoying her days immensely.

Spotting Vincent at the foot of the stairs, Danica called out, "Come join us for breakfast. Brinley made something special for you-she was worried after seeing how drunk you were last night."

"I have work. I'm leaving now," Vincent said, his tone flat as he walked past them, not bothering to look their way.

Danica's fork clattered onto her plate as she hurried after him. "Wait, I need a word."

Vincent stopped and turned, silently waiting for her to speak.

There was a long pause as Danica gathered her courage. She knew this wouldn't be an easy conversation,but she had to ask. "It's been several days... Have you and Hannah already secured the divorce decree?"
###Chapter 129 Redrafting The Divorce Agreement


Vincent's answer was blunt. "Not yet."

"Huh?" Both Danica and Brinley stared at him in disbelief.

Danica's mind raced through the worst possible scenarios. "Did Hannah back out again? Or is she making new demands now?"

Vincent shook his head, a troubled look crossing his face. "That's not it."

"Then what's the problem?" Danica asked, looking thoroughly confused.

Vincent chose his words carefully. "The divorce agreement wasn't fair to her. It needs to be rewritten. We can't finalize anything yet."

Brinley's lips pressed into a thin line, frustration flickering in her eyes.

Danica couldn't hide her irritation. "But l've already signed over ten properties to her! Isn't that more than generous?"

After what happened, Danica had already consulted with a lawyer. Hannah was right-those properties were as good as lost.

Vincent's reply was sharp. "She's still my wife. Everything under my name needs to be split the right way."

"That's ridiculous!" Danica protested, bitterness seeping into her voice. "Hannah did nothing for the company! Why should she get half of what you've built?"

Vincent shot her an icy glare. "I told you-stay out of my business."

Without another word, Vincent turned and walked away.

As soon as he was out of sight, Brinley leaned closer to comfort Danica."on't worry, Mrs. Jones.One way or another, things will work out for us."
Brinley reached out, giving Danica's shoulder a reassuring pat."|t′Ssjust about dividing assets. There's no sense letting this come between you and Vincent. Let him take care of it however he wants. Honestly, he's not listening to us right now anyway-it's best to let him be."

Danica released a weary sigh. "At least that troublesome Hannah is finally out of the picture." Her gaze sharpened with purpose. "Now all that's left is making sure you and Vincent end up together."

Brinley offered a gentle smile, but her eyes quickly turned cold. What really mattered was wiping out any bitterness Vincent still harbored toward her.

·.·
When Nova Tech moved offices, Felix and Hannah surprised everyone by giving the entire team a day off.

Seeing a rare window of free time, Hannah picked up her phone and called Vincent, determined to lock in a date to settle their divorce once and for all.

But,yet again, Vincent gave her an excuse. He couldn't make it.

Not wanting to waste her day off, Hannah tried another approach. "Then just let Derek deal with it for you."

"No," Vincent shot back, his refusal immediate and final.

Hannah's frustration was plain in her voice. "No to everything. Vincent, are you just dragging this out on purpose? If you don't wvant the divorce, why not just admit it?"

The line went silent for a long stretch.

She almost hung up, thinking he'd disconnected. But just before she put down the phone,his voice finally came through. "You're right. I don't want the divorce.".

Hannah's hand stilled, a jolt of disbelief freezing her in place. Had she heard him right? Vincent? Refusing the divorce? But wasn't he and Brinley already on the verge of getting engaged? She chose to brush it off.With a bidding for Miles's company on the horizon, she wasn't about to waste her only free day.

Planting her feet, she spoke with new resolve. "I'm picking you up now. Just give me thirty minutes. Bring the documents, and we'll settle the divorce at the courthouse."
Without waiting for his reply, she ended the call.

Vincent stared at his screen for a wvhile before summoning his legal counsel. "I need a new draft for the divorce agreement," he instructed, his tone measured. "No rush. Do it slowly. Got it?"

The legal counsel gave a confused nod, uncertainty still written across his face.

Twenty minutes later, Hannah pulled up in front of the Jones Group headquarters. She sent a text. "I'm here.Come down."

Vincent's response was swift. "Something's come up. You'll have to come upstairs instead."

Hannah shot back, "No." The last thing she wanted was to parade through his company, attracting more unwanted attention.

He sent another message. "This is about the divorce. It's urgent. If you don't come upstairs, we won't get the paperwork filed today."

With a frustrated sigh, Hannah grabbed her bag and headed inside.

To her surprise, there weren't as many stares or whispers as before. Aside from Clive, who still couldn't hide his dislike, most people seemed to treat her with newfound respect.

She walked into Vincent's office, only to find him in deep conversation with another man. Annoyance flared."So this is the urgent business? You wanted me to watch your meeting?"

Was he messing with her again? She spun on her heel to leave, but Vincent quickly caught her wrist and pulled the door shut behind them.

"He's our legal counsel. He's here to help rewrite the divorce agreement," Vincent explained.
###Chapter 130 The Divorce Will Have To Wait


The legal counsel struggled to keep his composure, inwardly reeling as the gossip he'd overheard was confirm ed as fact. The woman the office had whispered about for years-the so-called CEO's mistress-was, in reality,his legal wife.

"Vincent, I told you already, there's no need for a new divorce agreement. We'll stick tothe old one,"
Hannah declared, her voice unyielding. "Bring the documents and come to the courthouse with me."

A shadow flickered across Vincent's face. The way she pushed for a clean break gnawed at him.

"We're not rushing this," Vincent stated, his tone steady but brooking no argument. "Your divorce agreement is far too harsh on you. We're doing it over."

Hannah remembered how swiftly she and the attorney had thrown together the first draft last time. It was just past nine now-if they moved fast, she could still file for a divorce today and get her divorce decree soon. She gave in with a small sigh. "AIl right. How long do you need? An hour?"

The legal counsel shot a nervous,look at Vincent, his voice unsteady as he replied, "An hour? That's not possible, I'm afraid."

Hannah folded her arms across her chest, her gaze unwavering. "Then give me an estimate. How long?"

The legal counsel hesitated, finally raising three fingers.

"Three hours..." Hannah muttered, glancing down at her phone to check the time. "That's doable. I can work with that."

Vincent let out a sharp, deliberate cough.

The legal counsel instantly straightened, his tone suddenly forceful. "Three days! It'll take at least three days to sort through all of Mr. Jones' assets."

A chill settled over Hannah's features. "In that case, forget drafting anything new. Vincent, you're coming with me to the courthouse.Right now."

Three days? She wouldn't wait even one.

Vincent's expression never wavered. "The agreement needs to be rewritten. After eight years together, I refuse to let you walk away with less than you deserve."

"Come on! Drop the act. Just go through the divorce with me for that damn divorce decree. That's all the fairness I need!" Hannah shot back, every syllable cutting to the point.

His jaw clenched, eyes steely. "If there's no new agreement, there's no filing for divorce. You'll just have to wait."

"I won't accept that," Hannah countered, sharp and unyielding.

Vincent didn't budge, his voice brooking no argument. "That's final."

She met his stare, frustration flickering in her gaze. "You might have all the time in the world, but what about Brinley? Do you seriously want to keep her dangling?"

Vincent shot her a sidelong look. "This divorce is between you and me. Brinley's got nothing to do with it."

Hannah pressed her lips together, refusing to dignify him with another word. Vincent might verbally distance himself from Brinley, but things between them couldn't be untangled with words alone.

The tension between Vincent and Hannah hung heavy in the air, each refusing to yield.

A sudden ping broke the silence-Felix's name lit up Hannah's phone. She paused, eyes flickering over the screen.

Vincent wanted to get her to sit down and hash out the divorce terms-maybe even share dinner later,pretend for one more night that they could talk things through.

But before he could get a word out, Hannah turned and strode away. She left without a glance back, no explanation, no goodbye.

His breath caught in his chest, uncertain if it was rage or something far sharper. For once, he was the one left behind, watching her vanish without warning or excuse. The tables had turned. And the sting of it was almost more than he could stand.




Hannah's phone buzzed with a message from Felix-Nova Tech was in crisis, and he needed to see her immediately.

She slipped out of Vincent's office, only to cross paths with Clive as he sauntered out of the break room.

Their eyes met for a brief second-just enough time for him to toss a cutting remark over his shoulder."Some people can throw themselves at any man they like, but it won't change a thing. A mistress stays a mistress, no matter how hard she pretends to be the rightful spouse."

Normally, Hannah would've brushed off his nonsense if he kept his voice low, but every venomous word rang out, deliberate and sharp. She stopped and turned to face him, her voice steady."Are you talking about me?"

Clive barely bothered to glance her way. "What if I am? You're no better than your parents-always grasping for something that's never going to belong to you."

Fury hardened in her eyes. So, it-was indeed Clive who'd spouted nonsense in front of her parents and made her father faint due to fury.

Without hesitation, Hannah marched up to him, snatched his steaming coffee from his hand, and poured it straight down his head.
###Chapter 131 Daphne Whitaker


Clive's howls bounced off the walls, reverberating through the entire floor.

Every secretary in sight perked up, eager to catch a glimpse of the unfolding spectacle.

With a steely look, Hannah slammed the coffee mug down in front of Clive, her gaze sharp and unflinching.

Outrage colored Clive's face as he stumbled back, finger shaking in accusation. "Have you lost your mind?How dare you treat me like this?"

Hannah's lips curled into a frosty, joyless grin. "Consider this a lesson-loose talk always has a price."

"You..." Speechless and stunned, Clive gaped at her, unable to muster a comeback.

"I'd watch what comes out of your mouth if I were you. Next time you start gossiping about me, you'll have more than just hot coffee to worry about." After delivering her warning, Hannah didn't waste another second.She spun around and strode away, Clive wasn't worth another moment of her time.

Before long,Hannah was behind the wheel, heading for the spot Felix had mentioned. When they finally met, Felix laid out the entire story.

A crisis had erupted at Nova Tech: their supply chain was unraveling. In the span of a few days, vendors who had worked with them for ages were now refusing to cooperate.

Felix had just come back from a failed round of negotiations, the talks ending in disappointment.

With no time to lose, they set out for the next supplier-someone who had partnered with Nova Tech longer than anyone else.

Their hopes were dashed as soon as they arrived. The supplier wouldn't even come to the door, shutting them out withouta word.

Vendor after vendor turned Hannah and Felix away, leaving them with nothing but closed doors and mounting frustration.Finally, a new supplier-a recent addition to their network-reluctantly disclosed the reason after much persuasion, saying they had crossed a big shot.

But no matter how they pressed, he wouldn't name the company pulling the strings.

A disrupted supply chain spelled disaster for their plans, making it impossible to launch mass production of the wristbands. Even more crucially, they wouldn't be able to participate in Miles' company's bidding process, as they lacked a list of suppliers in their proposal. Every step along this path mattered-a single misstep threatened everything.

Setbacks didn't dampen Hannah and Felix's determination. Back at headquarters, they wasted no time and began hunting for fresh suppliers. Yet, as soon as the name Nova Tech surfaced, enthusiasm evaporated-suppliers who had shown interest suddenly backed away. This string of disappointments pointed to one cause: someone with power was working behind the scenes.

Trying another supplier now felt pointless to Hannah. The only way forward was to unmask the mastermind orchestrating the sabotage. Whoever it was had a strong motive-most likely a rival company with something to gain.

All day, the question circled in Hannah's and Felix's minds, but no clear answer emerged for either of them.



Ignoring Vincent's order, Brinley ventured out as she pleased. She split her time between office work and
socializing with friends every single day.

As the date for the bidding for Miles's firm drew near, Brinley grew determined to make an impression on Vincent. She set her sights on befriending Daphne Whitaker, Miles's sister, seeing it as the perfect opportunity.

Leaning into Daphne's gaming obsession, Brinley found ways to bond over every session, quickly winning her trust.

Gossip and curiosity were Daphne's favorite pastimes.

Knowing exactly how to keep Daphne engaged, Brinley spun stories about her childhood connection with Vincent, always casting Hannah as the unwelcome intruder who disrupted their friendship.

Eventually, Daphne let slip that she had caught sight of Vincent wwith Hannah once. A bad feeling had washed over her instantly-she'd pegged Hannah as trouble from the very beginning, but she hadn't realized Hannah was stepping into someone else's relationship.

Resentment for Hannah began to fester in Daphne's mind.

"I can't stand people who wreck relationships. Don't worry, Brinley. The next time Hannah shows her face,I'll be sure to defend you," Daphne said, brimming with righteous indignation.

Brinley's smile wavered, something uneasy flickering in her eyes. "Daphne, let's leave that topic alone," she replied gently."|actually wanted your advice about something else today."
###Chapter 132 Projects Halted


"Brinley, just tell me what you need from me. If there's something I can do, l'll help however I can," Daphne said with her usual straightforwardness. She'd never been one for playing games. Her loyalty to friends was the real deal.

Brinley hid her anticipation behind a warm, composed smile."Isn't your brother's company about to hold a bidding event? Coincidentally, my company has developed a product that might be just what they're looking for."

Pouring Daphne a fresh cup of coffee, Brinley adopted an easy, almost knowing tone. "Do you have any advice? If we wanted to pitch to your brother's company, what should we be ready for?"

Her tone sounded casual, but the intent was obvious-she was hoping Daphne would open a door for her.

Daphne gave a sheepish chuckle, a little embarrassed. "I wish I could help, but honestly, I don't know much about his business. He keeps me out of company stuff. I am afraid I can't be of any help."

"I see." Brinley's gracious smile never wavered, though a faint pang of disappointment tightened her chest."No worries. I'll find another way."

Brinley steeled herself..This bid was hers for the taking-she wouldn't leave it to chance.

Daphne's eyes suddenly brightened, as if a new idea sparked to life. "You know, I actually have a pretty good sense of what my brother looks for. When you've got your proposal ready, run it by me first."

A grateful smile broke across Brinley's face, her spiritš lifting. "You're a lifesaver, Daphne. I can't thank you enough."

This was the opening Brinley had been waiting for. She remembered that night at the gala, how Miles had suggested working together. But when she'd reached out later, he'd coldly redirected her, insisting that everything go through official channels of the bidding. She wasn't about to repeat the same mistake-if she wanted to lock this in, she'd have to use Daphne's influence. Daphne's smile grew warmer.11Come on, don't get all formal on me. Besides, my brother's actually passionate about female safety products. If he knows you're a friend of mine, your proposal will definitely get a real look."

Brinley lifted her cup with a bright clink against Daphne's. "Then I'Il happily accept your help. Here's hoping everything goes our way."

But she knew optimism alone wasn't enough. If she wanted results, she'd have to take on the competition herself. Nova Tech was the biggest threat in their path-a rival also gunning for dominance in the women's safety market.

Brinley's gaze sharpened as she considered her next move.

···
Three days had slipped by since Nova Tech finished settling into its new office space, yet all projects had screeched to a halt. No one had any tasks to work on.

Worse, both of Nova Tech's key leaders-Hannah and Felix-had seemingly vanished.

Day after day, the office buzzed with the same tension. With no direction and no assignments, employees started to whisper anxiously. Had the company relocated only to go under? The uneasy speculation only grew louder.

Evan Sawyer,a programmer, sat frozen in front of his phone. He stared at his banking app, his balance stuck at a meager $187.65. He didn't snap out of it until a coworker gave him a sharp nudge and suggested grabbing lunch.

Meanwhile,Hannah and Felix were still hustling, knocking on supplier doors with fresh business cards and a fake company name-anything to avoid Nova Tech's tarnished reputation.

But their cover didn't fool anyone. Word had clearly gotten around in the supplier circles-many recognized them immediately.

A handful agreed to chat anyway, but the conversations led nowhere. The moment they/ pressed for real information, the answer was always the same, delivered with a wary glance. "Don't ask questions youshouldn't be asking."

Setbacks piled up and morale sank, but Hannah refused to retreat. After hashing out a plan with Felix, she made a radical decision-she packed her things and set up camp right inside one of their suppliers'factories.

Every morning, she plunged headlong into the factory's daily grind, making a point to cross paths with Martin Clay, the factory owner, at every turn. Her relentless presence was impossible to ignore.

After days of this, Martin, exhausted by her sheer tenacity, finally caved. With a weary sigh, he tossed her a lead just to be rid of her. "You want to know who's coming after Nova Tech? Try Cerulean Bay. That's where your answers are."
###Chapter 133 Mr. Jones' Fiancée HHas A Criminal Record


Jones Group and VitraMind stand out as leading companies in the Cerulean Bay area.

Neither had ever competed with Nova Tech, so Hannah quickly ruled them out as suspects.

Hannah pulled up a detailed map of the area, scanning every label and logo, while Felix stood beside her,tapping away on his phone to look up unfamiliar business profiles. Any company with overlapping interests was immediately flagged.

Then, Hannah's eyes landed on a familiar name-Polaris Tech. In an instant, everything snapped into place.Back when Brinley had impersonated Victoria, Vincent had let her run Polaris Tech to pave the way for her.No wonder Brinley had previously approached Felix to acquire Nova Tech...

Hannah's expression hardened, a cold fury simmering in her chest. Brinley still hadn't learned her lesson,even after being imprisoned. First, the kidnapping and the web of rumors Brinley had spun about her. And now, Brinley was gutting Nova Tech's supplier network from the shadows.

A hot, furious pulse beat at Hannah's temples.

Felix frowned and marched to the door. "Let's confront her."

Hannah caught his arm and muttered, "Don't be hasty!"

She knew Brinley had made up her mind to bring down Nova Tech. There was nothing left to discuss-she had no intention of letting Brinley walk away unscathed.

Twenty minutes later, Hannah and Felix pulled up outside the police station in the city center.

They slipped a bribe to secure surveillance footage from around the police station and walked away with grainy screenshots: Brinley, flanked by two officers, hands cuffed behind her back as she was led into the police station.

Without hesitating, Hannah blasted those photos to a swarm of gossip-hungry reporters, adding a barbed message-the precious fiancée of the Jones Group's CEO had a criminal record.

Hannah attached a crystal-clear headshot of Brinley for good measure and then paid extra to guarantee the scandal shot to the top of the trending charts.

Mask pulled low and cap hiding her hair, Hannah slipped out, blending into the crowd, and headed straight for Polaris Tech, posing as a reporter and ready to stir up chaos.

..·
All morning, Brinley had been tied up in back-to-back meetings at Polaris Tech, her phone abandoned on her desk and buzzing with unread messages.

The second she stepped out, her secretary approached with an odd look in her eyes, explaining that a reporter was waiting just beyond the door, eager to interview her.

Brinley didn't catch the subtle tension in her secretary's tone. She simply saw a golden opportunity for some positive press coverage. After a quick stop in front of her compact mirror to fix her lipstick and smooth her hair, she swept into the meeting room and greeted the reporter with polished poise.

Across the table sat Hannah, face obscured by a cap pulled low, her phone already recording and a subtle voice changer masking her identity. Without hesitation, she lifted her phone and started a livestream.

Brinley, fixated on her reflection and every detail of her appearance, remained oblivious to any danger.She gave her secretary a brisk nod, signaling her to keep anyone from disturbing the interview.

Settling into a poised, almost regal posture in front of the camera, Brinley announced,"We can get started."

She had carefully crafted the persona she wanted to project, but the very first question made her face falter.

"Miss Gilbert, can you explain the circumstances that led to your imprisonment?"

Brinley stiffened, her expression clouding with irritation.

"We've also learned you've been called to the police station more than once. What were you accused of?Reports say you were sentenced to at least a year in prison. How did you manage to walk free so soon? Did you break the law, or did someone help you pull strings behind the scenes? Miss Gilbert, why the silence?  hiding something from the public?"

Hannah fired off each question in rapid succession, her disguised voice needling and relentless.

Brinley sat frozen, words caught in her throat, as Hannah pressed on with one cutting question after another.

Finally, Brinley's patience snapped.′′Who put you up to this? Get the hell out!" she barked, her expression twisting in anger as she lunged forward and tried to smack the phone from Hannah's hands.

Hannah backed away step by step, keeping her equipment close. "Are you seriously about to get violent,Miss Gilbert?"

Brinley's composure snapped. "Security! Security! Someone get this lunatic out of here!" she hollered, her voice ricocheting off the glass walls. But no one came.

The meeting room stayed eerily silent except for Brinley's frantic shouts.

Hannah lingered just out of reach, phone recording every second, a calm predator circling.

Brinley stormed to the door and yanked it open. "Didn't you hear me? I said I want security in here!" she bellowed into the hallway.

Instead of help, a wave of reporters flooded toward her, cameras flashing, questions fired in a dozen directions.

Brinley's commands were swallowed by the rising clamor. She looked around desperately for help, just as the first"reporter" pulled off their mask and cap. Her eyes widened in horror-was that reporter Hannah in disguise?

The chaos mounted rapidly. The secretary, finally realizing the situation was out of control, frantically dialed security.

Brinley could barely keep herself together as she snapped at the secretary,"Get the PR team in here now!We must handle those reporters and make sure no one knows about this!"

With a nervous glance, the secretary handed over Brinley's phone. "Miss Gilbert, you're already a trendingtopic."

Brinley's heart plummeted as she unlocked her screen and saw the live feed-Hannah had been streaming her entire downfall for the world to see. Her humiliation was viral.

Blind with fury, Brinley shoved aside an employee's desk, sending files and coffee tumbling to the floor.

The sudden crash brought the whole office to a standstill. Not a soul dared to move or speak.

At that moment, Brinley's phone rang, shattering the silence. She glanced at the caller ID-Hannah.Brinley answered stiffly.

Hannah's voice bubbled with wicked delight. "Hlow does it feel, Brinley? I prepared the whole surprise especially for you."
###Chapter 134 Let's Just Start Over And Rebouild What We Had


"So it was you, Hannah Scott!" Brinley all but shouted into her phone as she burst into her own office, her voice sharp with accusation. She kicked the door shut. "What the hell do you think you're playing at?"

On the other end, Hannah let out a slow, mocking laugh. "Come on, Brinley. Isn't it obvious? I'm just settling the score."

Hannah kicked her feet up on the desk, a frosty smirk curling at her lips.

"You're a rotten asshole!" Brinley retorted, barely able to contain the tremor of rage in her voice.

"Asshole?" Hannah's tone dropped, her amusement fading into icy disdain. "I don't even come close to your level. Let's not forget who started all this-the kidnapping, the smear campaigns, and now you've gone as far as to sabotage every one of our suppliers. If you're looking for the real villain, you might want to take a look in the mirror."

Brinley instantly grasped the key points-Nova Tech's suppliers had all gone dark, and Hannah bet she was responsible.

Recovering quickly, Brinley's tone turned deliberate and smooth. "Before you start pointing fingers, maybe get your story straight. Polaris Tech has Jones Group's full support. If someone's coming after Nova Tech,it's not me-it's Vincent. When it comes to protecting me, he can be utterly merciless."

A mocking sneer curled at the edge of Hannah's mouth. Obviously-how could she ever forget? Vincent would always move heaven and earth for Brinley.

Brinley seized the opening, her eyes glinting as she pressed the attack.′′O maybe Nova Tech isn't the real issue here. Look at you, fighting tooth and nail-what's the endgame? Trying to snag the title of Mrs. Wade?You sure bounce back fast."

Hannah let out a cold laugh as she shot back,′′Mylife is none of your concern. But if you're that desperate for gossip, maybe check your phone. You're all over the internet right now. That livestream? Instant classic. People can't stop passing around clips of your tantrum."

Hannah waited just long enough for Brinley to feel the sting and then forwarded her a perfectly mortifying screenshot. "Congratulations, Brinley. You're officially a viral sensation."

"You!" Brinley didn't get a single word out before Hannah cut the line, leaving her alone and seething, fury burning a hole through her chest.


···

Hannah hung up and immediately steered her car toward the Jones Group, rage pulsing in her veins. She had to face Vincent head-on. It was only a divorce-did he really have to go that far, attempting to destroy her company?

Seething, Hannah strode through the lobby like a force of nature, her glare so intimidating that the staff parted wordlessly to let her pass. No one dared challenge her-not after Clive's infamous coffee incident left him nursing burns and a bruised ego for weeks.①

Hannah barreled into Vincent's office without hesitation, striding past his stunned employees mid-reporting.

Vincent sat at the head of the table, not surprised by her presence. He dismissed his subordinates with a flick of his hand. "You can all step out."

His mind immediately jumped to the divorce agreement as her reason for coming. He motioned for her to sit,but Hannah stayed standing, her eyes blazing."Let's not waste time. What will it take for you to stop going after Nova Tech?"

At that, Vincent's eyes grew cold, a shadow settling over his features. So her purpose wasn't to resolve the divorce-she was here to negotiate on Felix's behalf? Both subjects struck a nerve, but watching her fight this hard for another man stung worse. The truth was plain as day: her heart now belonged to someone else.

He leaned back, masking his irritation behind a veneer of calm. "This is about Felix,isn't it?"

"Don't twist my words!" Hannah shot back, her eyes flashing. "Just answer me. Name your terms. How do l get you off Nova Tech's back?" A cold smile flickered at the edge of his mouth. "There's nothing you could give me that would make me 'change my mind." He paused, gaze unwavering. "Unless you're willing to walk away from Felix. For good."

"Absolutely not," she replied instantly, her voice steady and unyielding.

Vincent leaned back in his chair, lips curling into a self-satisfied smirk. "Then Felix's company collapses.End of story."

Hannah pressed her fingers to the bridge of her nose, the beginnings of a headache pulsing behind her eyes. "What exactly did Felix ever do to you?"

Vincent's tone was glacial. "He got close to you. Our marriage blew up because of him. Did you really think I'd let the guy who wrecked my relationship get off without consequences?"

A dry laugh escaped Hannah. "Don't even try to blame this on anyone else. Our marriage ended because we broke it. That's on us, not Felix."

He shrugged, unbothered. "In that case, why even go through with the divorce? Let's drop the paperwork.Let's just start over and rebuild what we had."

She stared at him like he'd lost his mind. "Are you listening to yourself right now?"

He met her gaze, his expression grave for once. "I'll take a three-month vacation. No work, no meetings.We'll travel-pick any destination you want. You always said we didn't spend enough time together, right?I'l give you that. Just us, no distractions."

He acted like everything could be fixed with a quick vacation, as if their marriage was just a business deal gone slightly awry. The sheer arrogance of it made Hannah's jaw clench. No wonder he kept dragging his feet-he'd never taken the divorce, or her demand, seriously in the first place.
###Chapter 135 Try To Read Your Mail This Time


Across the room, Vincent watched as Hannah fell silent, her eyes fixed on the floor, lost in her own thoughts.He assumed she was giving real weight to what he'd just said. He rose from his seat, crossed the distance between them, and reached for her hand."Let's forget about the divorce. We can still build a future together."

"Stop right there!" Taking several steps back, Hannah sidestepped his touch entirely and fixed him with a cold stare. "There's no future for us, Vincent. Not now, not ever."

Vincent's breath caught, and his fingers turned pale from the sudden force with which he withdrew his hand. He'd lowered himself, trying to bridge the gap, but had done nothing to move Hannah. Her resolve was unwavering, and her indifference stung.

A shadow crossed Vincent's face. "I'm willing to overlook your situation with Felix. What else do you want from me?"

Hannah scoffed. "What I want is a divorce. Can you give it to me now?"

Those words hit Vincent like ice, leaving a chill that wouldn't fade. Fidgeting with his wedding band,he answered with a rough edge in his voice, "Hannah, I don't have the patience to keep talking you down. This is your last chance."

"My last chance?" Her laughter was brittle and brief, her gaze hardening immediately."Let′Sclear something up. We're not a couple fighting over misunderstandings-we're ending a marriage. I don't need your empty promises or sweet nothing. I'm done being your wife."

No hint of softness broke through Hannah's resolve. A wall of cold resolve kept Vincent at arm's length, and every plea he tried to make broke against that wall, falling away useless and shattered.

"Then I guess we're finished here." Swallowing down a surge of frustration, Vincent realized nothing he said would change her mind-pressing further would only strip away what little dignity he had left. His words came out flat and cold. "Fine. We'll settle it. The moment the divorce agreement is drawn up, I'll sign."

A faint, cold smile flickered across Hannah's face. "You say that now, Mr. Jones, but I doubt you'll follow through. My attorney will be reaching out, so try to read your mail this time."

Without another word, she turned around to leave. Carrying on this argument had become pointless-whatever was left between them had already faded to nothing. As for Nova Tech, she and Felix would simply have to carve their own path forward. Challenges lay ahead, but so long as even a thread of hope remained,she would keep pushing.

As she reached the door, Vincent's voice cut through the silence. "Felix's company won't hold out for long."

Hannah tossed a look over her shoulder, lips twisting in scorn. "You know, you could make things easier-why not just help Brinley wipe Nova Tech out yourself? That would save everyone a lot of time."

With her final words, she slipped out of the room without hesitation.

Left behind, Vincent slowly reached into the drawer of his desk, pulling out a velvet ring box. He had meant to offer it as a promise for a fresh start, but Hannah's determination to end things left no room for second chances.

Fine. Since Hannah wanted to walk away, he decided he wouldn't stand in her way. Everyone could be replaced, in the end. It was merely a failed marriage, something he could live with.

Still, the stack of paperwork in front of him blurred together, impossible to focus on.

Discontent simmered under the surface, but Vincent couldn't name the source of his irritation. No matter how he tried, clarity eluded him.

Time slipped by as he sat there, only snapping out of his thoughts when he noticed Brinley had called several times.

When he finally picked up, Brinley's shaky, tear-filled voice spilled through the line.′′Vncent, everything's fallen apart. Hannah-she's destroyed me." "Hannah leaked the photos of me at the police station,"Brinley said, desperation sharpening her words."Now every news site is plastered with my face. Please, Vincent, you have to do something-I can't contain this mess on my own."

"Take it as a hard-earned lesson. You're not blameless here." With that, he ended the call.

The harshness of his reply stunned Brinley into silence. What exactly was Vincent implying?

Rage flashed in her eyes as she turned on the PR team. "What are you waiting for? Unless those articles disappear, nobody leaves this ofice tonight!"
###Chapter 136 Let's Buy The Island


After returning to Nova Tech, Hannah wasted no time and contacted a divorce attorney. Staying focused on the company's urgent problems was her top priority.

Time kept slipping away as the bidding deadline approached, and with no reliable suppliers in sight, Nova Tech's production process was far from complete. The way things stood, there was no chance VitraMind would agree to work with them.

Over two hours passed while Hannah and Felix combed through every potential supplier they could find.But it made no difference. The suppliers on the list were those they'd reached out to last time, most of whom had already rejected them.

A wave of discouragement washed over Hannah.

Felix paused, considering his options. With the pitch coming up soon, he started thinking about asking his family for help.

Neither of them spoke for a while, the quiet stretching between them.

Sinking into her office chair, Hannah absentmindedly scrolled through news stories on her tablet. Suddenly,a caption caught her eye:"Permanent population on Dace Island has grown to 200,000, with half of them being working-age adults. Most depend on fishing and are reluctant to leave their hometowns..."

That news jolted her upright, and a burst of inspiration shone in her eyes. There was their answer-a labor force ready and waiting. By bringing in young locals and setting up a factory right there on the island, they could control every part of their supply chain. Building independence for Nova Tech would mean breaking free from any outside hold.

Energized by the idea, Hannah turned toward Felix. "I just thought of something crazy."

Felix, curiosity piqued, came over to her."What's on your mind?"

"I'm going to buy this island," Hannah said, her excitement barely contained. She tapped her screen, enlarging the article. "We'll build our factory on Dace Island."

Felix leaned closer, studying the article, and then glanced at her with uncertainty."That's a huge gamble isn't it?"

Hannah nodded, willing to admit the risks. "It's bold, but owning Dace Island would help us bypass nearly every roadblock we're facing."

Getting around their supplier shortage was the main goal right now. Since someone tried to shut them out,Nova Tech would simply handle the supply chain on its own.

No doubt, taking over an island and building a factory from the ground up would be tough. Still, giving up before trying was never how Hannah did things. Whenever she had a goal, she found a way to make it real.That was always her way forward.

Felix's head bobbed as a small smile broke across his face. "Alright. Let's go ahead and buy that island."

Hannah didn't waste a second. "Let's set off now," she said, reaching for her bag.

Before she could leave, Felix gently caught her arm and offered a smile. "It's already past eleven. We need some rest. Let's get a good night's sleep and leave first thing in the morning."

That made Hannah pause, and she finally agreed. "Okay, that makes sense."

...
Across town, Vincent was still sitting in his office long after the clock struck eleven. Focusing on work had become impossible with his mind in turmoil.

He stared blankly at the wall, realizinghe couldn't decide which house to return to. All places felt empty without Hannah there.

Out of nowhere, his phone vibrated with a new message from the company's legal counsel. The draft of the divorce agreement was attached.

A wave of frustration surged through Vincent. Without even opening the document, he typed back.11|sthis all the Jones Group owns? You finished sorting the assets this quickly?"

A wave of frustration surged through Vincent. Without even opening the document, he typed back.11|sthis all the Jones Group owns? You finished sorting the assets this quickly?"
Seeing the message, the legal counsel broke into a nervous sweat. To clear things up, he decided to call Vincent straight away. He spoke with caution. "Mr. Jones, I wanted to let you know that Ms. Scott's attorney has already contacted us. They're pushing for things to move quickly and-"

Vincent didn't let him finish. "So you just did whatever they wanted? Just because they want it rushed,you skipped doing a proper review?" His tone grew even sharper. "You're the Jones Group's legal counsel.Should I really have to tell you how to do your job?"

The legal counsel stammered,11|−1understand your point, Mr. Jones. I'll get back to negotiating with Ms.Scott's attorney right away."

Without saying anything else, Vincent hung up. Frustration took over as he tore off his tie and sent it flying across the office.
###Chapter 137 Unable To Reach Hannah


Long before sunrise, Hannah and Felix boarded a private jet bound for Dace Island.

A local guide joined them upon arrival, eager to showcase every hidden corner of the place.

Instead of rugged hills or dense jungle, the island stretched out flat and wide, revealing breathtaking stretches of coastline and easygoing, welcoming locals.

As they wandered, Hannah's attention was snagged on an old, weather-beaten house. Instantly,she saw past the chipped paint and sagging roof, envisioning a modern factory humming with activity.

Once she floated her vision to a few locals, excitement buzzed through the crowd-the promise of new jobs stirred real enthusiasm.

Buoyed by their reaction, Hannah's confidence soared. That was what she wanted.

When the tour ended, she didn't pause for small talk. Felix in tow, she made a beeline for the government office,ready to pitch their plan to buy Dace Island.

Inside, the local officials radiated indifference, barely glancing up as she outlined her proposal.

Annoyance building,Hannah brought her hand down hard on the desk. "I'm putting ten million dollars on the table."

A stunned hush filled the room as all eyes snapped to her. One skeptical official broke the silence. "You seriously have that kind of cash?"

Stepping closer, Hannah's expression didn't waver."Why would I travel all this way just to joke around?"

That shifted the atmosphere instantly. Suddenly, the officials were eager, bombarding them with talk about prime beachfronts and all the investment perks the island could offer.

Catching Felix's eye, Hannah knew-at last, they had everyone's attention.Always impatient with drawn-out negotiations, Hannah sliced through their chatter. "Let's skip the formalities. Bring me the contract."

Recognizing she wasn't bluffing, the officials dropped their bureaucratic act. In no time, Hannah and Felix put pen to paper, making Dace Island officially theirs.

Later, Felix tried to split the payment, but Hannah waved him off.′′Save it.Keep your cash for Nova Tech's payroll."

Felix shifted uncomfortably. "Seriously, I can't let you foot the whole bill."

A playful grin tugged at HHannah's lips. "No worries. I'm quite loaded now."

Eyes scanning the endless blue horizon, she added with a spark of determination,"We'll earn that ten million back before you know it."

Faced with her confidence, Felix surrendered and laughed.

By sunrise the following day, Felix hit the ground running, spreading the word about the factory to the locals.Meanwhile,Hannah was neck-deep in renovation discussions with a team of contractors.

In the middle of reviewing blueprints, she happened to spot a familiar figure touring the island with a local guide. And it was none other than Miles.

Miles, who'd kept his trip hush-hush, stiffened when he spotted Hannah.

She greeted him with an easy nod. "Mr. Whitaker, what a coincidence running into you here."

A shadow of suspicion crossed Miles's face. "What, youtailing me again?"

Hannah just laughed, tugging off her gloves and moving closer. "Not at all,Mr.Whitaker. Let me roll out the welcome mat-this island belongs to me now."

A look of disbelief crossed Miles's face. "You bought this place?"

Sensing his skepticism, Hannah reached into her tote and produced the freshly signed contract, waving it for emphasis. "Sealed the deal just yesterday." Disappointment flickered across Miles's features. Dreams of transforming Dace Island into a luxury resort had been building in his mind. He'd pictured himself leading the charge. Instead, Hannah had gotten here first and snatched the opportunity from right under his nose.

A note of irritation crept into his voice. "Why did you suddenly buy an entire island?"

Hannah didn't miss the edge in his tone. She knew exactly why he was here-he'd come to claim Dace Island for himself. "Simple. I see profit everywhere," she replied, flashing a bold grin, ambition blazing in her eyes.

Unwilling to walk away, Miles asked, "How much do you want? Name your price."

Hannah picked up on his determination, her mind spinning with possibilities. Mischief danced in her gaze."Why not join forces, Mr. Whitaker? Two heads might turn a bigger profit."

A scowl deepened across Miles's brow. "I didn't come here for collaboration," he retorted, his patience running thin.

Hannah stood her ground, not the slightest bit rattled. "That's how it is, Mr. Whitaker. Dace Island belongs to me now. Either you join forces with me or start packing for your flight home."

Miles's glare grew colder. "So you're forcing my hand, trying to rope me into your plans?"

Her smile dropped away, replaced by an unwavering calm. "Nothing like that. It's simple: we can turn this place into something big, pocket the profits, and give the locals a better life while we're at it."

Deep down,Hannah felt certain-Nova Tech's lineup would dominate at the bidding, no underhanded games required.

Miles kept his gaze fixed on her, something unreadable flickering behind his eyes. Several silent moments stretched out before he finally relented.′′A|right.I'm in."


 

Meanwhile, Vincent's grandmother had picked up a stubborn cold after visiting an old friend, prompting Vincent to rush her to the hospital without a second thought. For four days straight, Vincent had tried to reach Hannah, but every attempt ended in silence. No hospital visits. No phone calls. She'd even blocked his number entirely.

Instead, her divorce attorney had started making regular appearances at Jones Group headquarters.Vincent refused to deal with a go-between. If she wouldn't talk tohim herself, what was the point?

He had always needed to feel in control of their relationship. Now, with Hannah completely shutting him out,he was left feeling the power slip from his grasp.
###Chapter 138 We're Not Fighting


Hannah and Felix spent a total of four days on Dace Island. Progress was steady as the factory received its upgrades, new equipment arrived, and the search for skilled workers continued.

What pleased them most was the enthusiastic support from the local residents-everyone seemned excited about the new job opportunities. Once training was complete, full-scale production was almost within reach.

On the morning of the fifth day, Hannah and Felix made their way back to Nova Tech.

Only a handful of days remained until the VitraMind bidding, so they wasted no time and started tackling the final details for their proposal.·

Returning to the office, they found themselves facing an unexpected issue. Evan, one of their programmers,had submitted his resignation.

Human Resources had been waiting for Hannah and Felix to come back before they could move forward with Evan's exit process.

Evan had been a core technical team member and had fought alongside them for several months.

Hannah wished things were different, but Evan's family needed him, and his mind was made up. She respected his decision, asking HR to ensure he left with a generous severance. For someone who had given so much to the company, it was only right to be treated well.

During the past four days, V/incent had been trying to get in touch with Hannah, calling her again and again,and sending message after message. She'd never answered, choosing instead to block his number.

Later that sameafternoon, as Hannah focused on the proposal in her office, Sharon's name appeared on her phone.

She figured Sharon must have found out about the divorce and was calling to talk. After hesitating for a moment, she answered and greeted warmly, "Hi, Sharon."For a second, there was only silence, and then a familiar deep voice broke through."|t′Ssme."

Vincent's voice was unmistakable. Hannah's face hardened, and she didn't let him say another word before ending the call.

Disgust washed over her. Immediately, she called her attorney to check in on the status of her divorce.That was when she learned that Vincent had dodged every meeting her attorney tried to schedule, always making excuses about being "too busy." Yet, he had time to flood her phone with calls and texts? She was not convinced.

Her attorney presented several options. Hannah went with the most decisive one-she told her attorney to take legal action. She also forwarded a folder containing all the photos she had gathered of Vincent and Brinley being close as proof.

Then, her phone started ringing again. She picked up and snapped,′′Vncent, have you completely lost your mind?"

Inside a ward of the hospital, Sharon had set her phone to speaker. She shot a glance at Vincent before saying gently, "Hannah, it's me-Sharon."

Sharon's calm and steady tone made Hannah hesitate, her own voice softening."Oh,hi, Sharon."

Sharon sounded worried as she asked, "Are you and Vincent having some sort of argument?"

Hannah's reply was subdued. "No, we aren't fighting." Divorce was right around the corner, though.

Sharon let out a sigh and let her voice tremble just a bit. "If there's no fight, then why haven't you visited since I got sick and hospitalized? You even missed my last birthday. Did you stop caring about me?"

Shock hit Hannah like a wave."What? You're sick?" Her voice grew tense. "Where are you? What's the room number?"

She wasted no time, grabbing her bag and rushing out.

Felix spotted her sudden panic and quickly followed.′′What happened?"

Worry showed on Hannah's face. "I need to get to the hospital. Sharon's not well." Sharon had revealed that she'd been admitted for three days, which made Hannah's heart pound with anxiety.

Felix didn't hesitate. "Let me offer you a ride."

Hannah didn't want to trouble him. Since they returned, Felix hadn't had a proper rest. Still, he insisted,so she relented and let him take the wheel.


···
As soon as the call ended, Sharon faced Vincent with a serious look. "Tell me what's going on between you and Hannah."

Vincent dodged her eyes, giving the usual brush-off."It's nothing." He left it at that and then moved toward the exit. "I'Il go meet her at the entrance."

Standing just outside the hospital doors, Vincent kept glancing at his watch while he waited.

It didn't take long before a car rolled to a stop. Felix got out first, followed by Hannah from the passenger seat.
###Chapter 139 She Moved Out On Her Own


Felix said he would wait for Hannah in the car.

With a nod, Hannah swiftly got out of the car and darted toward the hospital entrance, her mind consumed by thoughts of Sharon's condition.

In her rush, she barreled past the sliding doors, completely missing the figure waiting nearby.

A firm hand clamped around her arm, jolting her back-unable to stop herself in time, she collided with a man's chest.

Glancing up, she came face-to-face with Vincent. Instinctively, she wrenched free from his grip and put a solid distance between them.

Vincent's features hardened. "Where's the fire? Why are you storming in here?"

Ignoring his question, Hannah kept moving toward the lobby. "Shouldn't you be keeping Sharon company?What business do you have lingering here?"

Matching her pace, Vincent closed the gap. "We need to talk."

"Handle it through my attorney if it's about the divorce," Hannah retorted. Three failed attempts at civil conversation had taught her everything she needed to know-they simply couldn't talk things through.

A few steps ahead, Vincent doubled back to block her path. His brows drew together. "I'm not here to talk about the divorce."

Arms folded, Hannah let out a long sigh, irritation flickering across her face. "Then there's really nothing left for us to say." In her mind, the topic of divorce was the only thing connecting them now.

Vincent's face clouded with frustration, his gaze lingering on her in silence.

Intent on visiting Sharon, Hannah tried to move past Vincent, only to find him standing firmly in her way.
A grave look settled on Vincent's face. "I need you to hold off on telling Grandma about the divorce."

Hannah arched an eyebrow. "You can't keep it from her forever. Secrets always come out." She saw no point in hiding the truth.

Vincent's reply was steady but insistent. "For now, it's best she doesn't know. Her health can't handle that kind of shock."

A quick, dismissive answer left Hannah's lips. "Let me chéck out her condition first."

Were Sharon not seriously unwell, Hannah would have shared everything without hesitation. There were words she wanted to say to Sharon-honest; heartfelt ones-and she preferred to say them herself.

The chill in her tone didn't go unnoticed. Once more, Vincent picked up on the wall she'd put between them.That sense of distance unsettled him.

Hannah reached Sharon's hospital room before Vincent. The doctor just finished his examination when Hannah arrived, so she stepped forward to ask about Sharon's health.

Hearing the doctor describe it as only a mild cold-and Sharon herself as sturdy-put Hannah's worries to rest.

A warm smile spread across Sharon's face as she waved Hannah over. "Don't look so anxious. The doctor says I could have left days ago, but Vincent insisted I stay for proper rest."

Relief softened Hannah's face as she reached out to hold Sharon's hand. "It's good to see you looking well."Vincent remained silent on the sofa, his features difficult to read.

The cold distance between them didn't escape Sharon's notice. "Did something happen between you two?"she asked, concern lacing her voice.

Without hesitation, Vincent answered,"Yes."

Turning her attention to Hannah, Sharon offered a sympathetic smile. "Hannah, I bet he's the one at fault.Tell me everything and I'll put him in his place." She squeezed Hannah's hand in comfort. A wave of emotion caught Hannah off guard-Sharon had always been her greatest supporter.

No longer wanting to keep Sharon in the dark, Hannah decided it was time to share the truth, though gently.
"Sharon, there's something you should know... Vincent and I have separated for now."

She hoped easing into the news would soften the eventual blow of their impending divorce.

Sharon's reaction was swift-her gaze snapped to Vincent, her tone sharp."You foolish boy! How could you throw your own wife out?"

All Vincent did was look at Hannah."She moved out on her own," he said quietly. She'd even gone to lengths to make sure he couldn't find her.

Refusing to let things stand, Sharon replied, "As soon as I leave this hospital, you're bringing Hannah back home-no excuses."
###Chapter 140 It's Over Between Vincent And Me


Hannah looked at Sharon, her tone calm but weighed down. "Sharon, it's over between Vincent and me."

Surprise flickered across Sharon's face as she tried to process the news. Nothing had prepared her for this."Did you two argue that badly? What on earth happened?"

Quick to respond, Hannah shook her head. "No, it wasn't an argument."

Without warning, Vincent sprang up from the couch and reached for Hannah's arm. "Let's talk about this at home."

Sharon's expression grew severe as she spoke, her words crisp. "What are the two of you keeping from me?"

Trying to avoid the real answer, Vincent murmured, "It's just a disagreement." His grip on Hannah's hand tightened as if that could change anything.

Hannah pulled her arm away, every word slow and firm."|t′Snot just a fight. Vincent and I... WVe're already divorced."

Vincent's face darkened, his voice edged with frustration and pain."SCyou don't care about my grandma's feelings at all? That's heartless, Hannah."

Hannah answered with resolve, stepped over to comfort Sharon, and gently rubbed her back to help her breathe easier, "What's heartless is hiding the truth from her."

A few moments passed before Sharon found her composure again. Deep down, she struggled to believe that after just one birthday celebration, the granddaughter-in-law she loved so much was leavig her grandson.Dreams of bouncing great-grandchildren on her knee now seemed to slip further away.

A long sigh escaped Sharon as she gripped Hannah's hand. "When did all this happen?"

Hannah chose her words carefully. "It was just a few days ago." Vincent interjected, his voice sharp and defensive, "The paperwork isn't signed yet."

A pointed glance from Hannah followed. "Those papers will be finished soon enough."

"Hannah, are you sure you're not just mad at him?" Sharon still remembered how much Hannah once adored Vincent.

"Grandma, I've never been more certain. He just isn't the right person for me,"Hannah said, her voice steady and her eyes unreadable.

Sitting across from Hannah, Vincent could not accept her verdict. "Tell me, how exactly are we such a bad match? If we were never meant to be, how did we make it through eight years together?"

A heavy sigh escaped Hannah as she rolled her eyes. "We made it that long because I kept making all the compromises. I'm finished with that. Now this is over."

Vincent retorted sharply, "Marriage goes both ways. Are you telling me I never gave anything up for you?Can you name a single piece of jewelry you wanted that I didn't buy? I missed an important international conference to celebrate your birthday. You didn't like my female assistant? I replaced her with a man,didn't l?"

Hannah didn't so much as flinch. "So what? Are you really going to act like you're the only one who suffered? Those gifts were delivered by your assistant, not by you. Sure, you skipped that meeting, but you just worked from home instead. And about the assistant, you made your feelings clear. You can hire any woman you want now. It makes no difference to me."

Vincent's words caught in his throat. The tightness in his chest only grew worse as Hannah's cool tone pushed him further away.

Sharon glanced from Vincent to Hannah, picking up on every ounce of tension that filled the room. Trouble in their marriage had always been a possibility, but she hadn't imagined things would unravel so quickly.

Noticing the certainty in Hannah's face, Sharon decided not to argue. "If you've really thought this through,honey,I'll support you."

Hearing those words, Hannah felt the pressure in her chest begin to ease. Vincent, on the other hand, refused to let the matter rest. "She definitely thought it through. She started planning to leave me a whole month ago."

Sharon didn't hold back. "Vincent, you have no one to blame but yourself."

Nothing seemed to shake Hannah.

The shadows on Vincent's face grew even darker.

Sharon kept watching Hannah, her gaze filled with quiet sorrow. Leaning forward, she held Hannah's hands tightly. "Oh, Hannah, I truly hate saying goodbye to you."

From the very first moment Vincent had brought Hannah home, Sharon had been fond of Hannah.

There was something about Hannah's cheerful grin and the way she chatted with an elderly lady like Sharon that made it impossible not to love her. Since joining the Jones family, Hannah had always found moments to visit Sharon whenever shecould. Thus, to Sharon, Hannah was truly one of a kind.

It was clear to Sharon that Vincent had failed to treat Hannah as she deserved. Losing Hannah was a great loss for the Jones family.

Tears sparkled in Hannah's eyes. "I'm only leaving Vincent. I'll still come to visit you."

Wlith a gentle smile, Sharon reached out and tapped Hannah on the nose. "You mean it?"

"Absolutely," Hannah said, nodding with all sincerity.

All along, Hannah had hoped for a peaceful separation from Vincent. But he forced her hand by dragging out the divorce, leaving her baffled by his actions. Now, as his soon-to-be ex-wife, she couldn't care less about him.

Sharon's eyes softened as she looked at Hannah. "I'll hold you to that. Don't forget to come see me when you can."

A faint smile appeared on Hannah's lips. "You can count on it."

Vincent watched the conversation between them, his brow creased with frustration. No matter what hewanted to say, there was never a break in their back-and-forth.

The sudden sound of knocking broke through the moment, drawing their attention.

Hannah's smile faded instantly at the sight of the newcomer.
###Chapter 141 Then You Can Expect My Divorce Petition
"Sharon, I stopped by to visit. Has the pain eased?"Brinley entered the room, a sack of fruits dangling from her fingers. Her steps paused when her eyes landed on Hannah, her expression shifting several times as she remembered the humiliation from the recent incident.

Because Hannah had caused the chaos and brought those reporters over to capture the moment, Brinley had burned through plenty of cash to erase every headline from the web. Still, the gossip surrounding her incarceration hadn't faded completely.

Hannah's presence soured Brinley's mood instantly."What are you doing here?" she asked, voice lined with hostility.

"I came to see Sharon. Is that a problem?" Hannah replied with an indifferent lift of her brow.
"Of course not." Brinley walked further in and set the fruit down beside the bed. Then, letting her irritation spill over, she added, "It's just that since you're no longer married to Vincent, it's honestly odd that you're at his grandmother's bedside."

Vincent's features tensed. "Brinley, shut up."

"I'm not wrong, though," she grumbled lowly.

"You're right." Hannah rose with a faint grin,smoothing out her attire. "Given the current situation, it's inappropriate for me to linger. I'Il take my leave." Anyway, she had no plan to stick around and witness the affectionate display between Vincent and Brinley.

Before Hannah could offer her farewvell to Sharon,Sharon placed a steadying hand on her shoulder and made her sit back down.

"Don't leave just yet," Sharon ordered with firmness.Then, she turned to Brinley, her voice sharp as ice."Care to tell me why you find it improper for my granddaughter-in-law to visit me?"
Brinley countered swiftly, "Sharon, Hannah and Vincent signed the papers. She's no longer your granddaughter-in-law."

"In my heart, she still is. She's the only one l accept-regardless of legal status." Sharon's voice held finality and weight.

The message rang loud, and Brinley's mouth twisted in silent protest. She couldn't resist a jab. "Vincent's going to get married again. When that happens,won't you embrace the new granddaughter-in-law?"

The only granddaughter-in-law? Brinley scoffed.Once Vincent married her, she'd love to see how Sharon handled that.

"Marriage is his concern," Sharon said without budging. "But I get to decide whether or not to acknowledge someone."

The jab landed squarely. Brinley's fists curled by her sides.

Not wanting to hear more nonsense from Brinlev.  Hannah turned toward Sharon, her tone gentler."Sharon, I've got something to take care of. I should be heading out."

Sharon immediately tried to get up, clearly planning to walk Hannah out. "At least let me see you to the door-"

"No need," Hannah interrupted gently, guiding Sharon back to lean back. "Rest is what you need."

Sharon then looked toward Vincent. "I really can't move much. Vincent, go walk her out."

"There's really no point," Hannah replied firmly. "I've got someone outside already." She moved back a few steps, aiming for the exit. "I'll come by again soon."With that, she exited.

Sharon gave Vincent a pointed glance. "Well? What are you still standing there for? Go see her off already!"
Brinley, of course, had no intention of letting the two of them be alone. She quickly chimed in, "I'll handle it."
"Sit down and stay put." Sharon pressed Brinley into the chair and turned to Vincent again. "Go on."

Vincent looked hesitant but eventually shuffled forward, muttering, "She said she already has someone waiting for her. Why should I go and make a fool of myself?"

Sharon read him like a book, knowing that he clearly wanted to see Hannah off. Still, she didn't expose him.

Brinley, unable to stay still, stood up a minute later under the pretense of getting some water and slipped out behind him.

When Vincent got outside, he caught sight of Hannah several paces ahead, walking with purpose.He closed the distance quickly and stood in her path."Why so eager to leave?"

Hannah's expression was composed but distant."You came out to bring up the divorce again, right?"
Vincent's brow creased. "Is that seriously all that's on your mind-ending our marriage?"

"What else should it be?" She looked at her wristwatch. The hands hit three o'clock exactly."We've still got time. We could head to the courthouse right now and avoid a legal méss."

"You took it to court?" Vincent's frown deepened further.

"Yes." Hannah folded her arms, tone drained of emotion. "Since my attorney couldn't get through to you, I had no option but to sue. You can come with me to the courthouse to finalize the divorce now, and I'll drop the suit."

"You're impossible," Vincent snapped, his jaw tight."Then let the court handle it." She was so ruthless.

"Alright. Then you can expect my divorce petition."Done talking, Hannah turned on her heel and headed for the hospital parking lot.

"Hannah." Waiting at the foot of the stairs, Felix
waved gently.

Vincent instinctively reached out to stop her, but she dodged his hand effortlessly.

Without so much as a glance backward, Hannah walked right past Vincent and toward Felix.

As Hannah and Felix walked, their striking presence drew several stares from nearby onlookers.

Vincent's hands tightened into fists at his sides.
###Chapter 142 Sharon's Request


Hidden in the shadows of the hallway, Brinley managed to catch Vincent mentioning the court. A flicker of hope danced in her chest-if attorneys were involved, the divorce must be nearing its end.

After witnessing Hannah and Vincent split up, both looking frustrated, Brinley quietly slipped away,careful not to be seen.

Only once his cigarette burned down did Vincent return to Sharon's hospital room.①

With a practiced smile, Brinley presenteda plate with apple slices. "Here, Vincent,have some."

"No, thank you." He waved her off, slumping against the sofa, eyes distant.

Sharon, unable to ignore his deflated demeanor finally broke her silence. "Vincent, why are you and Hannah going through with the divorce?"
Shrugging off the question, Vincent responded,"She's the one pushing for it. If that's what she wants, I'll let her have it."

Sharon immediately picked up on the crux of the issue."And what about you? Do you really want a divorce, Vincent?"

Hope flickered in Brinley's eyes as she watched,eager for Vincent to give apositive answer.

No reply came-Vincent stayed quiet, his thoughts locked away.

The silence weighed on Sharon, who let out a tired sigh. "Whether you want it or not, you need to express it. People can't understand your heart unless you speak up."

Genuine concern filled Sharon's voice. "You have to stop bottling up your feelings. If you're against the divorce, you need to say so. If you're for it, you owe everyone that truth as well."

Eyes cast downward, Vincent retreated further into
his own thoughts.

A heavy silence settled over the room, the question lingering unanswered.

Brinley chewed her apple in quiet contemplation,wondering why Vincent found it so difficult to gJive a straight answer.


***

Meanwhile, over at Nova Tech, Hannah's attorney finalized the divorce petition and submitted it to the court on her behalf.Progress was unfolding on Dace Island. After intensive training, the locals were now skilled enough to handle the new equipment.

This small victory brought Hannah genuine relief-it was the brightest news she'd had in days.

The bidding proposal, however, remained a source of stress. She and Felix had been at it for two days straight, and only now was the first draft starting to come together.
That night, exhaustion crept in as Hannah sat at her desk, kneading her temples to soothe a headache.

When her phone rang, she answered automatically,fully expecting another call about the Blossom Village project.

Sharon's familiar voice, however, greeted her on the line. "Hannah, you sound worn out. Have you been working all night?"

Instantly, Hannah's tone shifted to one of gentleness."I just wrapped things up, Sharon. Is there something on your mind?" A soft smile spread across her lips,comforted by the warmth in Sharon's voice.

A pause lingered before Sharon spoke up. "If you're not caught up with work, could you help me out with something?"

Without a moment's hesitation, Hannah replied, "Of course.What do you need?"

Sharon's worry filtered through the line. "It's Vincent -he's burning up with a fever,and there's no one at the family estate with him. Brinley and Danica areout, and both Aubrey and Derek are away on holiday.I'm not even in town. I just need someone to check on him. Could you do that for me?"②

She tried to persuade Hannah, her voice gentle but persistent. "I know you and Vincent have gone your separate ways, but surely there's still a little concern left? Please, Hannah, just this once?"

A polite but firm refusal left Hannah's lips. "Sharon,I really can't help this time."

Sharon's voice trembled with concern. "Hannah,please. I can't relax knowing he's all alone and sick."

Reluctance wavered, and Hannah eventually gave in."You just want me to stop by and see how he's doing?"

"Exactly, Hannah, that's all I'm asking. Just take a look."

"Fine," Hannah replied quietly.

The call ended, and Hannah immediately let Brinley know about Vincent's condition. Since Brinley was sofond of Vincent, she'd race home the second she heard Vincent was unwell. All Vincent needed was someone to be there. Maybe having his old flame close by would speed up his recovery.
###Chapter 143 Disappointment


Sharon ended the call and gave Vincent's arm a firm yank as he sat next to her. "Did you even hear a single thing I said?"

Vincent's brow was furrowed, his jaw set tight. "I'm going ahead with the divorce, Grandma. You don't have to get involved."

Sharon shot him a look, clearly annoyed. "If you don't want to lose Hannah, you'd better listen to me.Otherwise, I'll call her myself and tell her you're suddenly feeling just fine and ready to get those divorce papers signed."

"Hannah and I are filing for a divorce," he remarked,his tone cold.

Pressing a hand to her chest for dramatic effect,Sharon commented, "You infuriating rascal! If you don't want me to faint out of distress, get your butt upstairs." She ushered him toward the staircase. "Imean it-do what I say this time. Pretend you're not well. Hannah's probably on her way. It'll just be the two of you in the house, so don't waste this opportunity."

With a sigh, Vincent gave a reluctant "okay" and slowly made his way upstairs.

Sharon watched him go, a heavy sigh slipping out.Without her help, the chances of him winning Hannah back were slim.

Up in his second-floor bedroom, Vincent undid three buttons on his shirt and rolled the sleeves to his forearms. He found himself struggling for words to speak with Hannah later on.

Stretching out on his bed, he stared up at the ceiling,his mind blank.

Nearly twenty minutes crawled by before footsteps echoed up the stairs.

The door creaked open with a soft click.
"Vincent,are you alright?" To his surprise, it wasn't Hannah who walked in.Brinley stood there instead.

Vincent shot upright on the bed, his eyebrows knitting together. "Why are you here?"

A note of annoyance crept into his words, though he hardly noticed it himself.

Brinley caught the tone and tried to hide her discomfort with a forced smile. "Vincent, were you expecting someone else?"

Without meeting her eyes, Vincent replied curtly, "No one." He marched over to the window and yanked the curtains wide open. "Why do you come to my room?"

A look of concern flickered across Brinley's face. "I heard you weren't feeling well, so I came to check on you. Are you still burning up?"

She reached out to touch his forehead, but Vincent dodged quickly, making his way over to the vanity."I'm fine," he said,brushing her off. Reluctantly, Brinley let her hand fall to her side. "Glad to hear you're okay."

For a few moments, the silence grew heavy between them.

Brinley tried to play it cool. "So, what's the plan after you and Hannah finalize the divorce?"

"No plans," Vincent said, his expression darkening."If you've got nothing else, I'd like to rest."

Brinley wasn't ready to give up. "Actually, there's something else. VitraMind's holding a bidding event in a few days, and it's Polaris Tech's first time in the ring. I'm kinda nervous. Could you come with me?"

"Just send all the details to Derek," Vincent replied as he turned away from her, making it clear the conversation was over.

Understanding she'd outstayed her welcome, Brinley offered a brief goodbye and quietly left the room.

Once the door shut behind her, anger twisted her features. Hannah had tricked her once again! Vincent's eyes had flickered with disappointment the moment he saw her. He seemed to be waiting for someone, and most likely, it was Hannah whom he wanted. Doubts crept in-maybe Vincent was second-guessing the divorce.

Brinley refused to let that happen. Without wasting time, she pulled out her phone and called the investigator she'd previously hired to dig up dirt on Hannah.

The first thing Brinley asked for was the phone numbers of Hannah's parents. Giving this divorce a push was her goal, even if it meant stooping low.

Using an anonymous number, Brinley fired off a storm of nasty messages to Hannah's parents, each one full of spiteful insults aimed at Hannah.

Elsewhere, Raymond and Margaret were enjoying a walk through their quiet hometown when their phones suddenly lit up with notifications.

As they read the texts, their anger boiled over. Every message was a cruel attack on Hannah."Hannah's so shameless. She's cheating and still won't let go of Mr. Jones."

"What a disgrace HHannah is. How did you end up raising such a disgraceful daughter?"

Raymond and Margaret had lived through this kind of drama before. Last time, they'd fallen for misleading claims and doubted Hannah. This time, they chose to trust their daughter and tried calling her right away.

When every call went to voicemail, Raymond and Margaret made up their minds right there. They would head straight to Dorbarrow. Hannah was supposed to be in the middle of a divorce from Vincent. What had prompted such insults?
###Chapter 144 Confrontation


Two hours later, Margaret and Raymond arrived in Dorbarrow. She intended to contact Hannah, but Raymond intervened. "Let's not go to her first. We should head straight to the Jones family estate!"

They had come to support Hannah, so naturally,they needed to go to the Jones family estate to demand an explanation.

After sending a text message to Hannah, the two quickly set off for the Jones family estate.

Danica had gotten back to the estate sometime after Brinley made her return midway.

Danica didn't anticipate that not long after she reached home, Raymond and Margaret would appear. The household staff had even welcomed them into the parlor and offered them coffee!

Danica's mood soured. "You barge into my home after your daughter brought disgrace upon the Jones family?"

"We came to have words with Sharon," Raymond stated, not sparing a glance at Danica, whom he regarded as despisable.①

"Speaking to her won't do a thing." Danica sneered,"Hannah confessed everything. She was unfaithful during the marriage and once carried another man's child. That's the kind of daughter you people raised!"

Raymond struck the table with fury. "That's impossible! My daughter would never behave like that!"

Brinley, hearing the commotion, hurried downstairs.She hadn't foreseen that Hannah's parents would arrive so quickly. Standing beside Danica, she chimed in, "Everyone heard it at the birthday party.Hannah is still dragging her feet and refuses to finalize the divorce."

Danica had no interest in prolonging the exchange."Go find your daughter instead of lingering in my house," she snapped. "We're about to disinfect the place."

Her breath shortened the longer they lingered. She signaled, and four servants stepped forward to escort them out.

Margaret couldn't hold back any longer. "Even after all these weeks apart, your venom hasn't dried up,"she snapped, seizing a nearby cup and flinging its contents at Danica.

Brinley leapt in front of Danica, her face bearing the full splash.

Danica flew into a frenzy and barked orders to the servants, "Unforgivable! Pin them down now!"

The servants hesitated, unsure of how to proceed.

"Don't just stand there! Restrain them or you're all dismissed!" Danica shrieked.

Not daring to defy her, the servants swiftly subdued Raymond and Margaret. Margaret and Raymond resisted, but couldn't escape. "Let us go! Fetch Vincent!"

"So you enjoy splashing water on others,huh?I'make sure you have a taste of your own medicine today!" Danica hissed. She reached for a cup,intending to splash Margaret.

"Don't you dare!" Raymond bellowed in rage.

Brinley's eyes gleamed with a hint of triumph.Hannah might have outplayed her last time, but she paid back by humiliating Hannah's parents.

But Danica's motion was cut short when somneone barreled into her, knocking her hand aside.

The cup turned in the air and soaked Danica instead,igniting her fury.

Hannah had burst in and shoved away the servants pinning Margaret. She had dashed over after seeing her parents' message, calling her parents multiple times on the way, but never getting through. She didn't expect to see her parents being restrained the moment she arrived.

While prying the servants' hands off her father,Hannah shouted, "Hands off!"

The servants instinctively released their grip.

Danica fumed, "Why are you obeying her? She's not part of the Jones family anymore. Know where your loyalty lies!"

The servants wavered briefly, but as they advanced again, Hannah shot them a blistering glare.

Felix stepped before Hannah, freezing the servants in place.

Margaret teared up as soon as she saw Hannah."Sweetheart, what is going on? Are the Jones family mistreating you?"

Raymond promptly held out his phone for Hannah to see. "Check these messages. No matter the circumstances, your mother and I are with you."
Hannah read the messages in silence, her eyes darkening. It was unmistakably from Brinley...

Hannah couldn't bear the sight of her parents in distress. She fixed her glare on Danica and Brinley,pulling her parents behind her, and slammed her foot into the table leg. The force flipped the table,scattering fruits and china everywhere.

The crashing sound jarred the entire room.

Danica screamed, "Hannah, have you lost your senses?"

Brinley's eyes narrowed with spite.

"Have I?" Hannah stepped across the wreckage,advancing. "You dare mistreat my parents, and I'm not allowed to flip a table?" ###Chapter 145 Taught Brinley A Lesson


Intensity radiated from Hannah, her presence nearly crackling with energy.

Danica shrank back a little but held her ground,drawing strength from the fact that this was still the Jones residence. "Your mother started this mess.Just look at what she did to Brinley!"

Margaret didn't miss a beat. "Maybe next time, keep your mouth in check. You called us broke and accused my daughter of cheating. Honestly, you're lucky all you got was a glass of water thrown at you."She would have surged forward again if Raymond hadn't gently restrained her.

Stepping into the fray, Felix tried to keep the peace."Mr. and Mrs. Scott, please-let Hannah take care of things."

Margaret nodded in agreement, though she eyed Felix with open curiosity.
Danica's patience snapped. "You're all uncivilized.Lèave at once! The Jones family doesn't want your kind here." In her mind, the mere presence of the Scotts brought disgrace to the Jones family.

Hannah scoffed. "You act like I'm desperate to stay.Breathing the same air as you makes my skin crawl."

Without another word, Hannah advanced.

Brinley, feeling the weight of Hannah's stare,instinctively ducked behind Danica for protection.

Nerves stretched taut, Danica sneered, "What are you planning to do now?"

"Why are you cowering?" Hannah grabbed Brinley and hauled her out from her hiding spot. "You actually had the nerve to mess with my parents? Did you honestly think I'd let that slide?"

Brinley barely managed to get a word out before Hannah, quick and unhesitating, twisted her arm behind her back. With a swift move, Hannah drove her knee forward , forcing Brinley to stumble and lose balance.

A single arm pinned Brinley to the floor, and with a sharp, practiced motion, Hannah slammed her hand down. Brinley's scream rang out, pain radiating from her palm.

"Let go! Hannah, please-let me go!" Brinley exclaimed, tears streaming down her face as she thrashed, but Hannah's grip didn't loosen for a moment.

Danica shouted in panic, "She has a heart condition!Stop this right now!"

She lunged to help, only to have Felix block her path,calm but resolute.

"This is their issue. Please, don't get involved," Felix said,voice steady as stone.

Danica's frustration boiled over. "Who do you think you are? Get out of the Jones home!" She shoved Felix, but he stood his ground, unmoved by her anger.

Brinley's cries echoed through the hallways, each one sharper than the last.

Hannah's expression stayed cold and unmoved."Painful, isn't it? You're lucky it's just your hand.I warned you not to mess with my parents. Did it sink in this time?"
Without that, Hannah released her grip-only to seize Brinley's.other hand, pinning it hard against the floor.

Brinley writhed in agony, her screams climbing in pitch with every movement.

Upstairs, the uproar pierced Vincent's sleep,dragging him out of his haze. Maybe he'd slept too long-his head was foggy, and the noise downstairs was overwhelming.

He made his way to the commotion, pausing in shock at the scene that greeted him. A stormny look took over his features. "What on earth is happening here?"

Heads turned instantly to the staircase, all except Hannah's.

At the sound of his voice, Hannah pressed down even harder.

Brinley's shrill plea cut through the chaos. "Vincent,please! Hannah is going to kill me!"

Vincent's anger simmered as he strode over, hand reaching out to pull Hannah away.

But Hannah caught his approach out of the corner of her eye, slipping out of reach before he could touch her.

Seizing her chance, Brinley scrambled upright and dashed to Vincent's side, using him as a shield. Tears spilled down her face as she raised her trembling,bloodied hands. "Vincent, look! She really tried to kill me!"

Felix quickly stepped to Hannah's side. "Are you okay?"

A silent nod was all the answer Hannah gave.
Vincent's gaze swept over the pair, tension crackling in the set of his jaw and the narrowing of his eyes.With a cold edge to his voice, he shot Felix a look and taunted, "Is it necessary for you to bring him everywhere you go now?"
###Chapter 146 The Court Session Is At Nine Tomorrow Morning
Hannah's tone was edged with impatience. "That's my choice."

Vincent was at a loss for words, furrowing his brow.

Danica wasted no time and hurried over to Brinley's side, eager to stir up trouble. "Vincent, I saw everything-Hannah was downright cruel. She barely spoke before flipping the table and slamming Brinley's hands down. And let's not forget Brinley's heart condition!"

Margaret interjected, unwilling to let the accusation stand, "That's not true! You two started this mess.Brinley sure didn't seem sick when she was throwing out insults."

Brinley lowered her head, an anxious expression flickering across her face.
Raymond addressed Vincent, "We're here to set things straight with your family. Since the divorce is happening, let's move things along quickly. We're just ordinary folks, not cut out for the drama of a rich family."

Vincent pressed his lips together. "Raymond,Margaret-"

Raymond cut him off before he could continue. "Let's stop right there. No more excuses."

For a moment, Vincent couldn't find the words to answer.

An uneasy silence filled the room, broken only by Brinley's sobbing.

Vincent eventually pulled himself together and turned to Hannah. "Brinley got a heart condition.Why couldn't you handle things calmly?"

Hannah let out a scoff. "If she's really sick, the hospital is where she should be, not picking fights every chance she gets." Her glare moved straight to Brinley. "If you dare to mess with my parents again,your hands won't be the only thing you'll need to worry about. If you end up in the hospital, I'll make sure you're treated-and I'll even pay the bill. If you can't handle trouble, stop looking for it."

Vincent turned to Brinley, his question clear. "What have you done this time?"

Brinley pretended not to hear, her cries only growing louder.

Danica chimed in, "Vincent, you see, Brinley's in a lot of pain. You should take her to the hospital right away."

Vincent didn't answer Danica. Instead, his attention stayed locked on Hannah.

Hannah glanced down at her phone, just as a new message came in from her attorney. She said to Vincent, "The divorce petition has already been sent to your company. The court session is at nine tomorrow morning." Without sticking around, she quickly left the room with her parents at her side.

Felix fell in step behind them, saying nothing.

Acting on impulse, Vincent hurried out and blocked Hannah's parents' path. "Let me give you a ride."

A cold laugh escaped Hannah. "You never once bothered about my parents in five years.Why put on an act now? It's honestly pathetic."

Raymond ignored the uncomfortable look on Vincent's face and shut him down. "There's no need for that. I've said everything I need to say. Mr. Jones,let's keep things peaceful as we part ways."

Margaret couldn't hold her tongue. "Exactly. What's with all this sudden kindness when the marriage is ending?"

Vincent moved his lips but couldn't utter a word.

Soon,Felix pulled up with the car, and Hannah and her parents climbed inside. Left standing there, Vincent felt a sharp ache settle deep in his chest.

Meanwhile, Danica had waited for Vincent so long that she almost believed he had gone off with the Scott family. She finally hurried outside with Brinley,looking for him.

Danica scowled at the sight of him rooted in the doorway, and there was a scolding note in her voice."Why are you just standing there? Can't you see Brinley looks pale? Get her to the hospital right away."

Her words jolted Vincent back to the moment. He quickly called Derek. "I'll have Derek take you."

Brinley's voice trembled as she asked, "Vincent,aren't you coming with me?"

Vincent was silent for a moment before he replied,"I'll go too."

He needed to figure out why his heart had been hurting suddenly, as it had happened se  already.

Brinley's face lit up with joy, convinced that Vincent still cared about her. She forced a drop of tears down for the effect. "Thank you, Vincent."

Danica gave Brinley a reassuring pat on the shoulder."You don't need to thank him. After all, you might join this family soon."

Brinley glanced down, her shyness making her hands ache a little less.

No emotion crossed Vincent's face.

Derek arrived soon after.

Within ten minutes, all three reached the hospital.

Vincent turned to Derek with a simple instruction to take Brinley to the emergency room for her injuries.Without another word, he headed off by himself.

Brinley hastily called after him, "Vincent, where are you going? I'm hurt so badly. Aren't you going to stay by my side?" He kept walking, answering over his shoulder, "I have something else to take care of. Derek will stay with you."

Brinley bit her lip, puzzled by what could be so urgent at the hospital. It seemed he still held onto what happened last time.

Yet, since he had brought her here in person, Brinley decided not to press her luck. As long as she succeeded at Miles' company bidding event in a few days, Vincent would surely see her in a new light.

Vincent didn't waste time and saw a doctor right away. Under the doctor's guidance, he underwent numerous tests but none revealed any heart issues.

Vincent explained that he'd been having trouble sleeping and couldn't concentrate, so the doctor gave him a prescription for sleeping pills.

A visit that was supposed to provide answers ended with him walking out carrying nothing but two bottles of sleeping pills.
###Chapter 147 She Didn't Show Up


Returning to the Jones family estate, Sharon found the place in disarray. Danica was barking orders at the staff as they hustled to tidy up the mess.

"What's gone on here?" Sharon's tone cut through the commotion, her authority unmistakable.

With a dramatic sigh, Danica laid the blame directly."It was Hannah. She lost her mind, flipped a table,and hurt Brinley's hands. Now Brinley's at the hospital."

A hard line appeared on Sharon's face. Her response was resolute. "That doesn't sound like Hannah.She never lashes out unless she's pushed to the brink.Clearly, something drove her too far this time."

Avoiding a confrontation, Danica mumbled, "You always take her side. Whatever you say."

"What was that?" Sharon asked, narrowing her eyes. Quick to redirect the conversation, Danica raised her voice. "I just meant the court date for Vincent and Hannah's divorce case is tomorrow."

Surprise flickered across Sharon's features. "It's happening that soon?"

Danica seized the moment to air her gievances. "It's ridiculous.She could have handled this quietly, but no-she insisted on dragging things to court. Anyone can see she's just after a bigger payout. She's shameless."

Sharon gave her a sharp look. "Since you've got time to gossip, go pull weeds in the garden."

By the next morning, Sharon refused to set foot in the courthouse to witness the divorce case.

Danica, on the other hand, seized the opportunity to dress to the nines, collected Brinley from the hospital, and made her way to court with Brinley in tow.

Vincent showed up not long after, his attorney  trailing at his side.

As soon as Vincent walked into the courtroom, his eyes swept the room-Danica and Brinley were there,but Hannah was nowhere in sight.

A few minutes before the hearing was set to start,Raymond and Margaret Scott made their entrance,taking their seats quietly.

Vincent couldn't help but glance at the doorway again and again, searching for any sign of Hannah.

But even as the judge took the bench and called the courtroom to order, Hannah's seat remained empty.Across the aisle, only her attorney sat ready on the plaintiff's side.

A deep frown settled on Vincent's face. Hannah had filed the petition herself-so why wasn't she here now?

When the judge requested opening statements,Hannah's attorney rose smoothly and addressed the court, "Your Honor, my client has authorized me toact on her behalf for these proceedings. She's provided a written statement for the record: 'Your Honor, I respectfully petition this court for a dissolution of marriage. Our five-year marriage has reached an irreparable breakdown, with no chance for reconciliation.What remains between us is only shared misery. I believe that ending this marriage serves the best interest of both parties, and I request a divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences."

A tightness gripped Vincent's chest, the ache so sharp that he could barely breathe.



At the same time, Hannah's entire attention was fixed on Nova Tech's proposal.

Felix eventually asked why she hadn't shown up at court. She didn't hesitate. "I trust my attorney to handle it."

A shaft of sunlight caught Hannah's face just as Felix glanced over, lending her an almost ethereal glow. An unfamiliar flutter stirred in his chest.

Snapping her fingers, Hannah pulled him out of his daze. "Hey, quit spacing out. Come see if this plan holds up."

Felix nodded, stepping forward."Sure."

Something about this focused, driven Hannah drew Felix in-the version who poured herself into her work, always charging ahead. It almost felt as if she'd never left the company behind for marriage.

While he leaned over her shoulder to scan the proposal, he blurted out, "Any second thoughts about the divorce?"

Without a pause, Hannah answered, "No regrets there. Honestly, the one thing I do wish I could undo is leaving Nova Tech for my married life. That move cost the company years of progress."

Felix let out a soft laugh, teasing, "If you'd stuck around,we might've gone public by now."

A confident smirk curved on Hannah's lips. "Absolutely," she replied, not a hint of bitterness from hèr failed marriage.



Back in the courtroom, Hannah's attorney presented an array of documents-undeniable evidence of Vincent's infidelity, clearly backing the plea for divorce.

On the other side of the aisle, Raymond and Margaret sat rigid, fists clenched tight. All the doubts and suspicions they'd buried now rose to the surface, proof that their daughter had borne more than anyone realized.

Not a word escaped Vincent as the proceedings dragged on. He stared at the empty chair where Hannah should have been. Her words-delivered by her attorney-haunted him: "What remains between us is only shared misery." How much resentment had Hannah bottled up over the years?

A sharp crack of the gavel snapped the room to attention. With formal gravity, the judge delivered the verdict."By the authority of the divorce act, the following judgment is rendered: First, Hannah Scott's petition for divorce is hereby granted. Second, marital property will be divided equitably under the law. This judgment takes effect immediately. Court is adjourned."

Chairs scraped, voices hushed, and people began to file out. Hannah's attorney wasted no time packing up and disappearing.

Moving as if in a trance, Vincent left the courtroom,his steps heavy, his figure weighed down by a strange loneliness.

Glancing at him, Brinley leaned toward Danica,keeping her voice low. "It's over, Mrs. Jones. You can finally relax."

Danica's mouth twisted in displeasure. "She made off with ten houses and half of Vincent's assets.That's hardly fair."

With a muttered agreement, Brinley made her way quickly toward the exit, hoping to reach Vincent before he disappeared. She fell in step beside him,wordlessly keeping pace as the courthouse faded behind them.

Knowing how raw divorce could leave a person,Brinley chose silence over comfort, understanding this wasn't the mnoment to press him with questions or advice.

Soft reassurances fell from Brinley's lips, but Vincent barely offered more than a stiff nod and distant silence in response.



Elsewhere in the courthouse, Danica's bitter remarks had not gone unnoticed. Raymond and Margaret lingered nearby, overhearing every last word. Just as Danica made for the exit, Margaret blocked her path.

Fixing Danica with a cold stare, Margaret's voice rang out. "Eight years of my daughter's life were spent with your son. She earned every damn cent, and the court's ruling was nothing but just."
Danica bristled, indignation flaring. "Just? You must be joking! Your daughter lived in the lap of luxury,playing housewife while Vincent carried the whole family on his back. She didn't even give him a child.And now she walks away with half of his assets? It's absurd."

A curl of contempt twisted Danica's mouth."You two only showed up to see how big her payout would be.The greed in your eyes was disgusting."

Margaret shot right back, voice cold and unflinching,"Funny, considering your son's infidelity. That's what's truly disgusting."

Without warning, Margaret surged forward, seizing a fistful of Danica's hair and yanking her backward.

Danica shrieked and retaliated instantly, clutching Margaret's hair and pulling just as viciously.

Shouts filled the hallway as Margaret's nails raked across Danica's face, and in seconds, the corridor was thrown into utter chaos.

###Chapter 148 Hannah's Parents Got Into Trouble
Hannah scanned the verdict her attorney had forwarded, her expression flat and unreadable.Everything lined up exactly as she'd predicted-almost perfectly.

But when she caught sight of the asset breakdown,her brows arched ever so slightly. She quickly tallied up the zeroes in her mind-this settlement would leave her far wealthier than she'd dared hope.

A sly smile flickered at the corners of her lips. Filing for divorce had been the best decision she'd made in years. After five years of a messy marriage,it was finally done. A deep sense of relief washed over her,lightening her shoulders.

Felix spotted the happiness glimmering in her eyes and leaned in, his voice ful of gentle curiosity."So?Did the judgment come in?" A bright, genuine smile broke across Hannah's face."It's official. I'm finally free."

Felix let out a warm laugh and remarked, "Congrats!That calls for a celebration-you're buying me dinner tonight."

Hannah replied with a smile, unbothered, "No problem-I'll make a reservation in a few minutes."

By seven, she called Felix and told him to meet her downstairs for dinner.

They were just about to leave the building when her phone suddenly rang-Margaret's name flashed across the screen.

Without hesitation, Hannah answered. "Mom, I won't be home for dinner tonight. I'm eating out with a friend."

Margaret's voice was tight with urgency. "Anna, your dad and I ran into some trouble. There's been an incident. You might need to come to the police station." Her words were tumbling out in a rush. A chill ran through Hannah. She ended the call, face clouded with concern. Turning to Felix, she said,"Looks like I'll have to take a rain check on dinner.Something's happened-my parents are at the police
station."

Felix immediately stepped forward, opening the passenger door for her. "Come on, I'll drive you."

Hannah shook her head. She didn't want to keep relying on Felix for everything. "That's kind of you,but it's all right-I'm driving tonight. You go ahead and have your meal. I'll handle this."

She gave him a grateful glance before rushing to her car. Without hesitation, she sped away, quickly disappearing from view.

Margaret's call had been frustratingly vague, leaving Hannah with a pit of dread and no idea how her parents had landed themselves at the police station.Her foot pressed harder on the gas.

When Hannah finally pulled up outside the station,she spotted a familiar figure. Inside the station, Danica sat across from her parents at a table, a stone-faced officer presiding between them.

The officer recounted the incident in clipped, formal tones-Hannah's mother and Danica had gotten into a physical altercation, leaving Danica injured enough to file a police report.

Sliding into the seat beside her parents, Hannah squeezed their shoulders, murmuring quiet reassurances.

The officer's voice turned severe. "According to the injury assessment provided by Mrs. Jones, both Mrs.Scott and Mr. Scott are being charged with intentional assault. If mediation fails, they may be held in criminal detention."

Margaret, who was usually bold and brash,seemed utterly shaken by the situation. Her hands shook as she tried to steady herself.

Raymond clasped Margaret's trembling hand in both of his, wordless but steady at her side.  Danica leaned back in her chair with a self-satisfied smirk, her gaze flicking sideways to gauge their reactions. "I'm not interested in mediation," she declared, her voice calm but cutting. Then, as if reconsidering, she tilted her head and let a sly note creep in. "But I'm not unreasonable. If you're sincere enough,maybe we can negotiate."

She let her words linger, eyes settling on Hannah.

Hannah's brows drew together, her voice cool and measured."What are you after?"

Danica met her look without flinching. "You walk away from the asset division. Sign a statement waiving your rights, and I'll drop the charges right now."

A scoff broke from Hannah, a sharp edge in her voice. "So that's what this is really about? My attorney fought for those assets. I'm not giving up a dime."
Danica's lips twisted with disdain. "Then be prepared to watch your parents get locked up." She turned her glare on Hannah's parents, voice dripping with còntempt. "Congratulations. This is the daughter you raised-so heartless that she won't even help her own family."

Raymond's expression grew stony as he snapped,"Don't try to drag my daughter into this. She shouldn't be punished for our mistakes-those assets are hers by right, and we'll answer for our own actions."

"It's all right, Dad. Really," Hannah replied gently,trying to steady him.
She turned to scrutinize Danica for a moment. The most striking injury was the scratch on Danica's face.

Hannah eyed the officer with a polite but pointed look. "Could I take a look at the injury report?"

The officer passed the folder across the table.

Danica shifted, visibly uneasy. "What? You think there's something wrong with my report? The officer has already verified everything. The paperwork is
 flawless."

Hannah flipped through the pages, examining the details. "Everything seems in order-the hospital's seal and the doctor's signature check out."

At that, Danica's shoulders relaxed; her face lit up with relief.

But Hannah shat the file with a soft thud. "I do have a question about the injuries described here." She fixed her gaze on Danica, her voice calm but unwavering. "Mrs. Jones, would you be willing to have a second evaluation done right now, in front of everyone? I'll cover any expenses."
###Chapter 149 Danica Shot Herself In The Foot
Danica didn't hesitate to shoot back. "Absolutely not.Your baseless suspicion is adding insult to injury!"

A smug smile played on Hannah's lipsas she ignored Danica completely. Turning to the officer, she spoke up. "I'm requesting a re-evaluation of the injuries.That's within protocol,right?"

The officer confirmed with a nod. "Yes, that's your right."

Hannah looked straight at the officer but speaking loudly enough for Danica to hear. "If it turns out Mrs.Jones's injury report was faked, can I file a counterclaim for slander and false accusation?"

Without missing a beat, the officer answered, "Yes,you can."

Restlessness took hold of Danica, her hands twisting nervously as she tugged at her hair.

Raymond and Margaret watched Danica squirm,feeling some of their own worries melt away.

Seeing her advantage, Hannah quickly typed a message on her phone. She added, "Mrs. Jones,a doctor will be here soon to give you a proper exam.If your injuries match what's written in your report, I'll accept whatever action the officer deems necessary.But if you've doctored the report, I won't let this slide."

A flash of panic crossed Danica's face, sweat appearing on her brow. She lurched forward,reaching across the table to grab Hannah's hand,trying to stop her. "Hold on! I'll drop the charges,okay?"

With a flick of her hand, Hannah brushed Danica away, grinning. "Nervous already? It's too late-the doctor's already on the way!"

Defeated, Danica slumped in her chair, her face pale.It didn't take long for her to recover, hands tremblingas she hurriedly sent a message to Vincent, begging him to come.

After twenty minutes, the doctor walked in and began examining Danica's supposed injuries.

Reluctance marked every move Danica made as she refused to cooperate.

Trusting her medical training, the doctor soon finished her assessment and gave her verdict-Danica had no significant external injuries except for the scratch on her face.

Hannah spoke up for everyone to hear. "So that means the report Mrs. Jones has provided isn't true."

The doctor gave a nod in agreement.

Margaret finally breathed a sigh of relief, having feared that her actions might affect her daughter.

Suddenly, Danica blurted out, jabbing a finger at Margaret, "She scratched my face! I could end up with a scar for life. How can you call that nothing?I refuse to let this go!"  The officer slammed his hand on the table, his tone commanding. "Enough! Quiet down."

Unlike Danica's outburst, Hannah's family stayed calm and collected.

Rising from her chair, Hannah addressed the officer,"May I take my parents home now?"

A nod from the officer gave her permission. "Yes, you can."
Not missing a beat, Danica chimed in, "Officer, I want to drop the charges. I'm not pressing this anymore."

She tried to make a quick exit, but the officer stopped her short. "I'm afraid you aren't free to leave. You're being detained for making a false accusation, interfering with justice, and submitting a fake police report."

Danica widened her eyes. Detained? That was it-she had really shot herself in the foot.

Danica slumped into her chair, her whole posture weighed down by the blow.Vincent stepped out of the courthouse and didn't waste a minute before returning to the office. He dove into the day's tasks with sharp focus, lettingthe hours slip past him.

Clive, seeing Vincent buried in files again, gently reminded him,that he still had three months of unused vacation.

Vincent shut that down without hesitation, firmly saying he had no plans to take time off. He had already set his sights on the next target-doubling the company's market value once more.

He kept at it until long after sunset, not stopping until the clock pushed past eight in the evening.

Upon receiving Danica's message about being detained,he frowned.
Within twenty minutes, Derek pulled up to the police station. As soon as Vincent stepped out of the car,he spotted Hannah and her parents walking out of the station.

Vincent made no effort to avoid them and called out,"What brings you here?"

Hannah caught his eye but strode right past without a word.

Moving quickly, Vincent stepped in front of her. "It's just a divorce, Hannah. No need to act like strangers.If you keep this up, I might start thinking you still have feelings for me."

Hannah responded coldly, "Keep dreaming."

Curiosity got the better of Vincent. "What happened to all of you?" There was a hint of real worry in his voice.

A sharp look crossed Hannah's face, her irritation obvious as she thought of what his mother had done."You should ask your mom about all her 'good deeds."
Without a word for Vincent, Margaret took Hannah by the arm and guided her away. "Don't waste your  breath on your ex-husband."

Raymond followed along, offering Vincent only a frosty stare.

Vincent's frustration grew, and he opened his mouth to ask more, but someone hurried up before he could speak.

Felix came jogging over, a bag in his hand."Raymond, Margaret, is everything okay?"

A smile broke across Margaret's face when she saw Felix. "Felix, what brings you here?"

Raymond returned the warm greeting and reached out to take the bag from Felix.

Vincent watched this exchange, feeling the sting of being left out. The difference in how they welcomed Felix only made his own bitterness deepen.
###Chapter 150 Felix's Cunning Moves


Felix gestured to the bag, a gentle smile playing on his lips. "I figured no one's eaten yet, so I brought over some food." He glanced at Hannah, his tone softer. "Picked up everything you like. I hope it works for your parents, too."

Margaret beamed, reaching out to squeeze his hand in gratitude, "You always make the best choices.We're happy with anything you bring!"

Hannah made her way over, a flicker of surprise warming her features. Felix's thoughtfulness never failed to catch her off guard. In that moment, she made herself a quiet promise-she would grow Nova Tech into something bigger than ever. A grateful smile found its way to her lips. "Thank you, Felix.Really appreciate it."

The four of them fell easily into conversation,laughter weaving between them, the kind of easycomfort that felt like family.

Nearby, Vincent lingered at the edge of the group,clearly left out. Bitterness prickled, and he couldn't resist tossing a snarky comment Felix's way. "You two don't waste any time, ddo you?"

Vincent couldn't handle it, and his dislike toward Felix deepened. What was this? Meeting the parents already?

His words weren't loud, but the edge in his voice made sure everyone heard.

Hannah's brow creased. "If you're looking for something to do, Mr. Jones, maybe go check in on your mother. She's probably still shaken up from everything."

With that, she nudged her parents toward her car."Don't mind him." Turning to Felix, she asked, "Did you drive tonight?"

"Uh, no. I took a cab," Felix replied, rubbing the back of his neck Without missing a beat, Margaret ushered Felix into the front seat. "That works out. Hannah can drive you home."

Felix didn't object-in fact, he flashed Vincent a smug grin as the car rolled away.

The four drove off together, laughter and conversation trailing behind them.

Left alone, Vincent lingered for a moment, discomfort knotting in his chest. As he finally moved forward,a familiar vehicle caught his attention-Felix's car,parked nearby. So Felix had driven here all along.

"Sneaky bastard," Vincent cursed under his breath.

Upon entering the police station, Vincent quickly pieced together the events that had unfolded. His gaze hardened as it landed on Danica, sitting off to the side.

After settling the fine and signing her release, he led her back to the car in silence.

Danica, noticing the tension radiating from him, sat. quietly.
Vincent finally broke the silence, voice low and cold."What possessed you to go after Hannah's parents?"

A defensive edge crept into Danica's reply. "I wasn't the one at fault. Her mother started it-she completely lost it and attacked me. I was only trying to defend myself after she scratched my face."

She kept her real reasons hidden-confessing them would only make Vincent mad at her.

He wasn't fooled. He knew his mother all too well. No doubt she'd provoked Margaret first. "My marriage to Hannah is over. The Scotts are no longer part of our lives. Don't mess with them anymore," he warned,his tone unmistakably serious.

Danica offered a meek, "Alright," lowering her gaze,but behind her quiet answer, her mind was already spinning with schemes.

Scheming anew, Danica fumed inside. Watching half the Jones fortune handed over to Hannah stungmast worse than any injury.

As soon as they returned to the Jones family estate,Brinley hurried over, her eyes wide. "Mrs. Jones,what happened to your face? Are you alright?"

Soaking up Brinley's fussing, Danica slipped her arm around Brinley. "Don't worry, sweetheart. The doctor patched me right up."

Meanwhile, Vincent noticed his grandmother shuffling down the hall, cane tapping the floor.A glance at his watch told him it was well past ten. Why wasn't she in bed?

Sharon cut in, voice leaving no room for argument,"Brinley, help Danica get settled. I need to speak with Vincent alone."

Danica and Brinley nodded in sync and took off without a second thought.

Sharon reached for Vincent. He stepped forward,ready to support her.

Then, out of nowhere, she smacked his hand away like it burned.

A look of bewilderment flashed across Vincent's face."Grandma,what was that for?"

Disappointment sharpened Sharon's words. "Didn't I tell you to fake sickness, to wait for Hannah to come and take care of you that day? And now I came home to find out you two are already divorced?"

Brinley had wasted no time filling Sharon in on the court ruling as soon as she returned.

Determined to get answers, Sharon had stayed up late just for this confrontation.

Cane in hand, Sharon brandished it threateningly,swinging for Vincent as he ducked and weaved to avoid her blows.

Eventually, he managed to grab her wrist, stopping the next swing. "Grandma, listen-Hannah didn't even come to see me that day!"

A flicker of surprise crossed Sharon's face. "She didn't? But she promised me." "Maybe what she meant was sending Brinley in her place," Vincent replied, holding her gaze. "Hannah is determined to divorce me. Nothing could've changed her mind. That plan of yours didn't have a chance."

Sharon seized the moment to jab him with the tip of her cane. "You ungrateful boy-everything I've done has been for your own good. Do you think I want to be involved in-your messes? If I didn't worry you'd grow old and lonely, I'd leave you to your own devices."

A wry smile crossed Vincent's lips."You really should let me sort out my own problems, Grandma. You're seventy now-don't go wearing yourself out for my sake."

Sharon shot him a pointed glare. "Seventy doesn't mean senile. My wvits are just as sharp as ever."
As her eyes narrowed, she seemed to remember something. "Now that I've got you here, let's settle this. Do you actualy like Brinley or not? Out with it."
###Chapter 151| Have Something To Tell You

Vincent's expression grew somber as recollections he wished to forget emerged. "Why do you also assume I have feelings for Brinley?"

"Everyone notices how well you treat her," Sharon responded.

Vincent had always been quiet and withdrawn since childhood, and at times, even Sharon couldn't read his mind.

Vincent's brow furrowed just a little. "While others might be oblivious to the reason I treat Brinley well,you should know the answer well."

Sharon observed his figure, realizing for the first time how isolated her grandson appeared. The burden he bore-that unseen weight-had been suffocating him for years. He was only five when the incident hadhappened. Two lives were lost because of him.How còuld anyone possibly mnove past that?

"And what about Hannah? Do you still have feelings for her?" Sharon asked,her voice soft.

Vincent thought for a long moment before answering, "I don't know."

His connection with Hannah had always been about mutual compatibility. He didn't dislike her, and with his grandmother's fondness for her, marriage seemed like the natural progression.

Sharon sighed quietly, deciding to say nothing.


***

In Hannah's apartment in Sterling Heights, Felix dined with Hannah's family.

During the meal, Margaret and Raymond showed a keen interest in Felix, bombarding him with numerous questions.

Hannah attempted to intervene but struggled to ake any impact.

Once they finished their meal, Hannah eagerly guided Felix toward the neighborhood's exit. Feeling
a little embarrassed, she apologized, "Sorry if my parents were a bit too curious earlier."

Felix paused and glanced at her. "Not at all. I found them warm and welcoming."

"I'm relieved you didn't feel uncomfortable." Hannah didn't linger on the subject, assuming Felix wouldn't interact much with her parents in the future.

Hannah expressed her gratitude earnestly once more. "Thank you for today."

"I didn't do much." Felix seemed to have made up his mind about something, fixing her with a serious gaze."After the bidding meeting, I have something to tell you."

Felix stressed, "It's very important."

"Alright. I have something for you then," Hannah responded with a smile. Felix's ears flushed slightly, and he found it suddenly difficult to meet her eyes.

"Then it's a promise," he said, quickly hailing a taxi.Once inside, his heart raced uncontrollably.

After Felix departed, Hannah headed back home.

As the elevator doors opened, Hannah was surprised to see Miles. She hadn't seen much of him since their encounter on Dace Island.

She greeted him politely, "Mr. Whitaker!"

Miles acknowledged her with a nod.

Silence stretched between them in the small elevator space.

Hannah kept her gaze on the ascending floor numbers, wishing they would move faster.

"Let me clarify something," Miles suddenly said,startling Hannah.

VitraMind had just obtained the roster of participants in the upcoming bids, and Nova Tech appeared among the contenders.

"Our cooperation on Dace Island won't translate to preferential consideration for your organization,"Miles continued. "We stand by impartial standards and ensure identical conditions for all applicants."

"We absolutely acknowledge that, Mr. Whitaker.You can count on Nova Tech to deliver excellence!"Hannah's expression lit up with assurance, a faint grin tugging at her lips.

"You seem incredibly sure," Miles remarked, doubt subtly woven into his voice.

Hannah let out a laugh. "What you're seeing is the product of collective dedication. Confidence is necessary.Mr. Whitaker, I remember when you went solo to seek investors-you displayed certainty and grace."

"You've read quite a bit about me?" Miles lifted a brow with mild intrigue.

"Certainly.Since our firm places significant weight on
its future alliance with VitraMind, gaining insight felt important." Hannah glanced toward the rising floor number. "Mr. Whitaker, this is where | exit. I'll leave you here."

Miles stood momentarily bewildered. Hannah wasn't aligning with the image he had formed.
###Chapter 152 Did You Come With Felix

For two solid days, Hannah and Felix poured all their energy into the bid proposal.

Draft after draft crossed their desks, and the final version only received its approval just a few hours before the submission deadline.

On the morning of the bidding event, Hannah dressed in a sharp black suit that made her look both polished and prepared.

Although the bidding event was set to begin at ten,she and Felix arrived at the venue shortly after eight.An event coordinator showed them the way to the multifunctional hall.

Before they could go inside, they were required to draw lots. Hannah ended up with the seventh slot for her presentation. personally selected by Miles, who only considered products he truly wanted to work with.

Taking on the role of lead presenter, Hannah immediately grabbed her laptop as soon as she sat down, double-checking every detail of the proposal.

A few people in the room recognized her and kept glancing in her,direction, but she didn't let it distract her. Her focus remained locked on the proposal's key sections, making sure her talking points were both crisp and clear, repeating them in her mind.

The quiet didn't last long as the room quickly filled with conversation.

Snippets of talk floated her way, and it didn't take long for Hannah to realize people were gossiping about Brinley and Vincent.

A glance upward made Hannah accidentally lock eyes with Vincent, though she quickly turned her attention away.

Brinley, following Vincent's line of sight, spotted Hannah.

Taking advantage of Vincent being surrounded by company executives, Brinley wasted no time and strode over to Hannah. "This isn't the kind of event you should be attending," she said bluntly.

Hannah calmly shut her laptop, leaned back in her seat, and gave Brinley a cold stare. "And what sort of event is this that I'm not allowed to attend?"

A smirk played on Brinley's lips as she tried to look important. "This is an invitation-only affair for CEOs of companies. Are you one? You shouldn't just walk in here. Leave right now, or I'll call security and have you throwNn out."

Unmoved, Hannah responded, "Go ahead and call them. I'd love to see who dares to try."

Just then, Felix returned from the restroom to find Brinley confronting Hannah. He immediately stepped forward, putting himself between the two women."Miss Gilbert, what are you hoping to accomplish this time?"Brinley's chin lifted with attitude. "Mr. Wade, do you really think it's right to bring someone with no connection to the company into an event like this?"

Felix answered in a calm, even tone, "Hannah is not unrelated. She's one of Nova Tech's partners."

A sharp laugh escaped Brinley. "Mr. Wade, you can't just invent some fancy title to bring your girlfriend here. I'm not that gullible. How could someone who was once a full-time housewife really be your business partner?"

Hannah stood up and stepped forward, meeting Brinley's gaze head-on. "If you don't believe me, why not try to get me kicked out?"

"Think I won't?" Brinley quickly waved over an event coordinator.

Before anything else could happen, Vincent called out, "Brinley, don't start any trouble."

Brinley pulled her hand back, her tone sulky."Vinc ent, Hannah doesn't qualify to attend this event. I'm not causing trouble-l am reasonably suspicious."

Vincent gave Brinley a hard look. "Mind your own business. Other people's affairs are none of your concern."

Brinley's shoulders slumped in defeat. "Fine." The sight of Daphne coming near caught her attention,so she pointed Daphne out to Vincent before going to meet Daphne.

Vincent glanced at Hannah and asked, "So, did you come with Felix today?"

A sharp reply left Hannah's lips as she sat back down and reopened her laptop. "That has nothing to do with you,Mr.Jones."

Felix was just about to sit beside her when Vincent slid in first, bumping Felix out of the way.

Annoyance flickered across Hannah's face. "What are you trying to pull?"

With a shrug, Vincent replied, "I like this spot.It has a

great view." His eyes drifted to her laptop. "Are you working for Felix these days?"

Hannah's patience was running out. "Vincent, why do you care what your ex-wife is doing?"

A stubborn glint flashed in Vincen's eyes. "Who says a man can't care about his ex-wife? And don't flatter yourself-I'm not asking because I can't get over you." He stared straight ahead. "Rest assured, since we're divorced, I won't cling to you."

"That's very reassuring, Mr. Jones." Hannah forced a laugh and stood, tugging Felix along. "You can keep your precious seat. We'll find another spot."

Vincent watched them walk away, a shadow falling over his expression.
###Chapter 153 Defended Her


Daphne's face broke into a bright smile as she spotted Brinley, hurrying over to wrap Brinley in a warm hug. "Brinley!"

A spark of mischief lit Brinley's eyes the instant she caught sight of Daphne. She wasted no time,grabbing Daphne's wrist and tugging her off to the side. Leaning in, she dropped her voice to a hushed whisper. "You won't believe this-Hannah's heretoo."

Daphne's brows shot up, genuine shock flickering across her face. "Wait, what? Didn't you tell me she's just some housewvife? No real job after the divorce,just drifting from one guy to the next for company.What issomeone like that even doing at a bidding event?"

Every word dripped with scorn.

Brinley, sensing an opening, twisted the knife a little deeper. She jerked her chin toward the far corner, where Hannah sat with Felix. "Why else? She's got her little support system. Felix is absolutely obsessed with her. I barely said a word before the two of them jumped down my throat and told me to keep out of their business."

Daphne's face tightened with indignation."Unbelievable. I'm Miles's sister. If anyone has the right to say something, it's me. I'm going over there."She didn't wait for a reply, marching straight toward the pair.

Across the room, Hannah and Felix were locked in conversation. Felix watched her with a soft, lingering smile, the kind that made their rapport impossible to ignore.

That sight fueled Daphne's irritation. Without breaking stride, she squared her shoulders and stalked over, chin lifted, her every movement brimming with righteous superiority. "This isn't a playground for your little romance. We're here for business, so how about you act like it?"

Hannah's head snapped up, surprise flashing acrossher face as she met Daphne's glare. She sat back in her chair, refusing to shrink away. "You might want to watch your language."

Although their words were quiet, the tension quickly drew curious glances from people nearby.

From a distance, Brinley watched with satisfaction. If Daphne managed to get Hannah booted from the event, all the better.

Vincent drifted to Hannah's side, moving on instinct to shield her from the confrontation.

Brinley lunged to intercept him, but he ignored her entirely, striding straight past and leaving her fuming.She stomped her foot in frustration and rushed to keep up.

"You're still putting on that act? Please. Everyone here knowvs you can't function without a man.Career? Your whole career is latching onto various guys!" Daphne's voice cut sharply through the chatter, her words dripping venom. Daphne's words were outright vile. Hannah didn't hesitate as her palm cracked across Daphne's cheek,the sound reverberating off the marble walls.

Daphne's face flamed an angry red, pain stinging her pride as gasps swept through the watching crowd.No one had ever humiliated her so openly. Her shock twisted instantly into outrage. "How dare you slap me? Do you even realize who you're dealing with?"

Hannah met Daphne's glare without flinching,her tone ice-cold and even. "I don't even know you,but you spread lies about me. I am already being nice by retaliating with just one slap."

Daphne's entire frame shook, her cheeks burning with fury. No one had ever dared to speak to her like this before. She jerked her arm up, hand ready to strike, but Felix moved faster-his grip caught her wrist,unyielding. "Enough. Show some due respect,"he muttered, his voice sharp and unwavering.

Felix released her with a sharp flick, sending her stumbling back a step, her pride shredded. Daphne's voice broke, sharp and shrill. "Security! Throw ths damn woman out! She doesn't belong here!"

Two security guards immediately advanced, but before Felix could react, a voice sliced through the tension-cool and steady, but so authoritative that it halted everyone in their tracks. "I'd like to see anyone try."

Vincent didn't raise his voice, but the sheer command behind it made the air itself bristle. The guards froze mid-step, exchanging wary glances.

Brinley, watching from the sidelines, bit down on her lip,jealousy and frustration twisting her features.

Daphne squared her shoulders, glaring at Vincent as she snapped, "I dare you to stop me!"

She wasn't the slightest bit intimidated-this was her brother's territory, and she acted like she owned the place.

Vincent, however, moved in front of Hannah with deliberate, icy resolve, his stare pinning Daphne in place. "If you so much as touch her, you answer to me."

Felix shot Vincent a sidelong look, his face giving nothing away.

Daphne, undeterred, spun toward the security guards and barked, "What the hell are you waiting for? Get that woman out of here-now! Who signs your paychecks,anyway?"

But the guards stayed rooted to the spot, unwilling to risk Vincent's wrath. No one in the room was foolish enough to go up against him.

Hannah, however, was far from grateful. She shoved Vincent aside with a scowl. "I don't need your interference."

Vincent's face went stone-cold as he responded, "I was defending you."

She leveled him with a piercing stare. "I can fight my own battles." She didn't even bother disguising her indifference. "Let me remind you-we're already divorced." Hannah whirled, eyes icy, leveling a sharp finger at Brinley. "And you-do yourself a favor and keep Vincent out of business that doesn't concern him.I don't need some self-appointed hero swooping in on my behalf."

Vincent spoke up for Hannah for the sake of their past marriage, but her icy rebuff left him raw. The way she dismissed him cut deep, and his temper flared. He shot back, his tone firm and resolute, "So what if we're divorced? I'm not heartless enough to let anyone push you around. If that bothers you,that's your issue, not mine."

A heavy hush fell over the room. So, the rumors had been true all along-Hannah and Vincent really had gotten married and then divorced. And Brinley was really the other woman.

A ripple of judgment swept through the crowd, every gaze settling on Brinley with open disdain.

Feeling the weight of their stares, Brinley balled her fists at her sdes and shot Hannah a look burning with resentment. Daphne looked utterly unbothered, barely blinking at the swirling gossip. She'd long ago chosen sides-Brinley's version was gospel. In her mind, Hannah had swooped in and wrecked a perfect childhood romance, stealing Vincent away and shattering Brinley's dreams.

Curling her lip in mock annoyance, Daphne flashed
Vincent a childish sneer, sticking out her tongue."See? You're falling all over yourself to save her, and she doesn't even appreciate it."

The air in the hall felt impossibly heavy, every breath tinged with expectation. For a long, charged moment, not a single person dared make a sound.

Then, a sharp voice cut through the tension."Mr.Whitaker is here!"

Daphne's eyes went wide, her whole face lighting up with relief. Spotting Miles, she darted over and grabbed his arm like a lifeline, her finger stabbing accusingly toward Hannah. "Miles, she hit me!"
###Chapter 154 Brinley Had The Gall To Steal lt
As Daphne approached Miles, Hannah's forehead creased. This girl was actually Miles's sister?

Felix promptly moved forward to clarify, "Mr.Whitaker, there's been a complete misunderstanding."

Miles directed his attention toward Hannah. "Can you tell me what transpired?"

"I told her to get out, and she wouldn't-then she hit me!" Daphne omitted every detail and zeroed in on her accusation.

Hannah refused to be wrongfully accused. She advanced and stated without emotion, "Mr. Whitaker,your sister labeled me as someone who survives by attaching herself to men. I felt insulted and struck her." "I wasn't wrong!" Daphne clutched Miles's arm, her voice petulant. "Someone like her has no business being in an event this important. Just kick her out already!"

Miles's expression hardened as he answered, "No."

That one word instantly drained the color from both
Daphne's and Brinley's faces. Even Miles stood behind Hannah now? What kind of manipulation had she used to sway someone like him?

Brinley pierced Hannah with a hateful look, silently seething.

Daphne protested, "Why not?"

"She's Nova Tech's co-founder.Her name is officially listed," Miles answered nonchalantly, though the revelation sent a ripple through the room.

Felix decided to make it known to all. "Hannah is indeed Nova Tech's co-founder. She's only been out of sight due to private reasons."

Vincent's forehead tensed minutely. Eight years  together, and never once had Hannah mentioned her connection to Nova Tech. What else had she been hiding from him?

Daphne stamped a foot, still defiant. "Regardless,she hit me! That's a fact! She needs to say sorry."

"I will say I'm sorry," Hannah respoonded coolly, "but only if you apologize to me first for the rudeness and offensive comments." Then, she turned in Miles's direction. "Mr. Whitaker, don't you think that's reasonable?"

"Yeah," Miles responded with a neutral tone.

"Miles!" Daphne's voice cracked with emotion. "I'm not going to say sorry to her!" She spun and fled in tears.

Brinley cast one last spiteful stare toward Hannah before leaving after Daphne.

Miles paid his sister no heed and stated, "Everyone,thirty minutes remain for the presentation."

The crowd began to scatter as the participants returned to fine-tune their proposals.

"Right this way, Mr. Jones." Miles motioned toward the judging area.

"No need. I trust your evaluation," Vincent said,casually settling elsewhere.

Miles didn't press it.

Back when Miles was starting from scratch,the market hadn't had much faith in Al development.Raising capital had been tremendously difficult. That was until he approached Vincent. Though Vincent had originally declined, he'd later reconsidered and backed the venture personally. That pivotal funding had allowed VitraMind to scale rapidly. With that,Vincent had become one of VitraMind's original stakeholders.

With half an hour to go, Hannah stepped into the restroom to freshen up and refocus. As she returned,a familiar voice-Brinley's-caught her attention,along with a second one that sparked recognition.She couldn't quite identify it. Believing it to be another messy episode with one of Brinley's former partners, Hannah saw no reason to stick around. But their next words stopped her in her tracks.

Brinley said, "Not bad. Getting you onboard was smart. Nova Tech doesn't stand a chance this round."

A male's voice rang out. "Still a few tweaks left. Let me fine-tune the code."

Hannah went stiff. That phrasing triggered a memory -long nights working, Evan whispering as he took over, "Let me fine-tune it."

No wonder Evan had left so suddenly-he'd switched sides to work for their rival.

A blaze of anger erupted within Hannah. She nearly barged in, but forced herself to inhale deeply and stay composed. Since Brinley had recruited Evan,their product pitch might be dangerously similar to Nova Tech's. Time was of the essence. Back in the hall, Vincent observed the sharp dètermination on Hannah's features as she returned -it was clear something was off. But before he could question it, she walked straight over to Felix.

Given how distant she'd been earlier, Vincent chose not to interfere.

After a swift dialogue with Hannah, Felix rose to request a change in the order of presentations.

Meanwhile,Brinley returned with a confident grin and deliberately claimed the seat next to Vincent. She leaned in, voice sugary as she whispered, "I'm so anxious, Vincent."

Vincent's response was detached and direct. "Just stick to your script. Securing this deal with Miles's firm would be huge for Polaris Tech."

Brinley bit her lip, newfound determination taking hold. Since Vincent valued this pitch that highly,failure wasn't an option. Victory was imperative.

At exactly 10:00 a.m., the pitching round commenced. The teams presented one after another.

Earlier, Brinley had talked Daphne into moving Polaris up to sixth in the queue.

When it was Brinley's turn, she walked up confidently and began her pitch. The product? A smart necklace that monitored hormone levels.

Hannah and Felix exchanged glances. The shape had changed-from wristband to necklace-but the content was blatantly lifted from their project. Brinley had the gall to steal it.

Hannah's eyes stayed locked on the loading screen on her laptop. As long as the update finished in time,she might still be able to modify their system.
###Chapter 155 A Side Of Her He'd Never Witnessed Before
When Brinley launched into her pitch for the hormone-monitoring necklace, she caught the subtle glint of intrigue in Miles's gaze.

That tiny shift fueled her confidence-she straightened her posture and occasionally shot smug,sidelong glances at Hannah.

Hannah, though, remained unmoved. Head bowed,she appeared entirely absorbed in her laptop screen,not reacting once.

A trace of a smile flickered across Brinley's lips. In her mind, the win was already hers.

Meanwhile, the loading bar on Hannah's laptop crawled to completion. As it finally flashed 100%, she fixed her attention on Evan's code. There was no room for second -guessing now. She dove in, fingers racing as she rewrote the handful of lines that actually mattered.

Hannah was just about to close the program when,out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Brinley's triumphant expression. Her own lips curled in a faint,almost mischievous smile. Since Brinley was so certain of victory, maybe it was time to deliver a surprise of her own.

Brinley straightened, radiating poise as she addressed the room, her tone full of conviction, "Up next, we'll be showcasing a live demo of our product's core features. To make everything crystal clear, we've built a code-driven simulation that lays it all out, step by step."

With a click, she shifted seamlessly from her PowerPoint to a browser, the demo springing to life.She scanned the judges, her eyes sparkling with anticipation, certain they'd be impressed.

Instead, a wave of puzzled whispers swept through the audience, rising and falling with barely-concealed skepticism. She instinctively flicked her gaze to Vincent, catching the deep crease in his brow. Her stomach tightened.When she glanced over at Miles, his expression was just as severe.

Miles fixed her with a cold stare. "This is what your company calls a demo?"

A surge of panic twisted through Brinley's chest.Did the concept fail to impress? She forced herself to look calm, inhaling slowly, lips parting as she prepared to highlight the product's features.

Then, her gaze landed on the demo screen, and her entire mind sputtered to a stop. There was no product simulation. In its place, huge lines of flashing,code-rendered text blared from the screen."I'm sorry.I plagiarized."

The words blared across the screen, glaring and impossible to miss.

A hot flush spread up Brinley's neck, burning her cheeks red. She fumbled desperately to shut the browser, but just as her finger reached the remote, another line blinked onto the display. "I messed up.Taking credit for someone else's work was wrong."

Brinley finally managed to shut the whole thing down,but the whispers in the room only grew, rising in volume and intensity. With her hands shaking, she gripped the presenter's remote like a lifeline.Struggling to regain her composure, she pressed her nails into her palm and forced out a clear voice."Next, I'd like to-"

Miles didn't let her finish. He cut in, his tone frigid,"That's enough. Don't waste any more of our time.Next presenter."

Miles had entered the hall expecting a brilliant pitch from "Victoria." Now the disappointment on his face was unmistakable-he saw the whole thing for what it was: a total letdown.

Brinley stood frozen beneath the harsh stage lights,her teeth digging into her lower lip as she scrambled for a way to salvage the situation.

Before she could speak again, Miles signaled to an

event coordinator. The event coordinator approached briskly, her professional smile masking any pity as she gently guided Brinley offstage.

In the audience, Hannah and Felix traded a brief,knowing smile, satisfaction flickering between them.

Settling back into her seat, Brinley immediately angled herself toward Vincent, desperation in her voice. "Vincent, I swear-someone sabotaged me.I would never stoop to plagiarism."

Vincent's face gave nothing away. "Let's discuss this later. Just pay attention to the remaining presentations."

His voice was calm, lacking any hint of reproach or contempt, and that-more than anything-allowed Brinley's nerves to loosen, if only slightly. Still,resentment twisted in her stomach.Who the hell had pulled this stunt?

Hannah finally let herself exhale, her shoulders losing their tension as she mentally rehearsed the strongest points she'd higghlight on stage. The presentations ticked by, one after another, until it was Nova Tech's turn.

Felix reached over, his fingers closing gently around Hannah's hand-a quiet reassurance. "Don't let the pressure get to you. I'll be right here, always."

A quiet smile tugged at Hannah's lips. "I know," she said,her voice steady. "Relax-we've got this."

Vincent sat just a row behind Hannah and Felix, close enough to see every detail. Despite himself, he kept a constant watch on the pair, unable to miss even the smallest exchange. His lips locked tight, his features twisting into a thunderous scowl. The sight of his ex-wife and her suitor exchanging subtle but unmistakable encouragement made something bitter twist inside his chest. Why did it still get under his skin?

Hannah walked to the stage and tapped her remote,bringing up the first slide. The words Hormone Monitoring Wristband flashed boldly on the screen,immediately setting off a ripple of whispers throughout the  room. Without missing a beat, she projected her voice across the audience. "I can tell you're all intrigued.I hope you'll keep that curiosity alive as we introduce what Nova Tech has created. And unlike Polaris Tech,I promise you-this is one hundred percent original work. Plagiarism isn't in our vocabulary."

Her gaze locked onto Brinley, the message sharp as a knife-Nova Tech had drawn a line in the sand, and Polaris Tech was standing on the other side.

Offstage, Brinley's insides churned with humiliation.She wanted nothing more than for this nightmare to vanish,but Hannah's pointed remarks had dragged her and Polaris Tech right back under the harshest spotlight.

A violent urge clawed at Brinley-if she could've, she would've shredded Hannah right then and there.

Five years had slipped by since Hannah last claimed a stage as her own. The experience felt strange and electric all at once-almost as if she were stepping back into the fierce, unstoppable version of herself she'd been in college. She straightened her shoulders and radiated composure, every word crisp,every gesture measured.

At first, Vincent barely paid attention. But as she continued, his focus sharpened, surprise flickering in his eyes. He'd never witnessed this side of Hannah before-undaunted, magnetic, and absolutely in control.
###Chapter 156 Not An Outsider


Hannah introduced version 3.0 of the hormnone-monitoring wristband, guiding everyone through a quick live demonstration of its current features.She pointed out the possibility of adding artificial intelligence, making it easier for the audience to see just how useful the device could become.

Once she wrapped up her explanation, Miles asked,"Can you promise the hormone monitoring feature in your wristband is truly accurate?"

Remaining poised, Hannah replied with steady confidence, "We have put the wristband through several rounds of testing with different groups. Each phase has brought the precision of our hormone tracking to a much higher level."

Other judges soon followed with more questions,Hannah handled each one with remark composure and expertise. At the start, Miles had written Hannah off as just another pretty face. After hearing her speak, his view shifted completely. He hadn't expected such a smooth and persuasive performance, and his impression of her changed right on the spot.

"No further questions," remarked the panel of judges, bringing Hannah's presentation to its official close.

A wave of applause washed over the room. Cheers and clapping echoed as people showed their support.

With her part finished, Hannah finally allowed herself to relax, and relief shone through her features.Hearing the crowd's applause, she knew all her hard work had finally paid off. For five years, people had expected her to fit quietly into the mold of a housewife. Looking back now, she saw just how much of herself had been wasted during those years.

Standing here, she finally felt like she was living the life she was always meant for. A sense of satisfaction welled up inside her that she had never experienced before.

Felix, standing just below the stage and watching her,couldn't help but smile to himself as his heart raced a little faster. This was the real Hannah-bold,bright, and impossible to ignore.

Meanwhile, Brinley's anger was impossible to miss.She couldn't stand to hear even one more word of praise for Hannah. Her hand shot out, grabbing Vincent's arm as she tried to lead him away. It didn't escape her notice, though, that his eyes were locked on Hannah up at the front.

That only added fuel to Brinley's fury. Her glare cut straight through Hannah, her expression hard and bitter. With her voice as steady as she could manage,she said, "Vincent,let's leave."

Derek can take you home. I have something else l need to handle," Vincent said before walking out of the hall.
A short while after the last presentation finished, the organizer stepped forward, waited five minutes, and took hold of the microphone to announce the outcome.

A hush swept through the hall.

"Everyone, I am excited to share that today's top prize, chosen unanimously, goes to Nova Tech for their Hormone Monitoring WNristband!"

The crowd broke into applause once again.

If looks could hurt, Brinley's glare would have burned right through Hannah. She felt robbed of her own chance at glory, watching as Hannah claimed what she thought was meant for her.

Trembling from head to toe, Brinley's features twisted with rage.

Overflowing with happiness, Hannah clung to Felix's hand, unable to find words for the joy in her heart.

As people crowded around to offer congratulations,Hannah and Felix thanked every single person who came up to them. At last, Nova Tech had finally stepped into the public eye. A representative from VitraMind rushed over and asked if someone from their team could come and sign the contract.

Felix reached out and gently pulled Hannah by the arm. "You handle this part. I'll finish things up over here."

She nodded once. "Alright. I'll come find you when I'm done."

Without delay, Hannah walked after the representative and headed straight for Miles's office.Inside, she was surprised to see someone else present. The moment she caught sight of Vincent,the brightness in her face faded away.

Right away, Vincent noticed the shift in her mood.He scowled. "Are you really that upset to see me?"

Hannah didn't answer him at all. Instead, she turned toward Miles and spoke politely. "I didn't realize you had company. I can come back later to sign the contract." She was just about to leave when Miles stopped her."There's no need for that. Mr. Jones isn't an outsider.Let's go ahead and sign everything right now."

Standing still, Hannah kept her voice calm and remarked, "Mr. Whitaker, perhaps you don't realize-one of Mr. Jones's subsidiaries, Polaris Tech, is actually one of my competitors."

Vincent's frown deepened. "The Jones Group is huge. Why would we waste time on a small business like yours?"

Her reply came sharp and clear."Well,who knows?You're certainly capable-nothing's off the table with you."

With that, Vincent picked up on her meaning right away-she was calling him out for putting pressure on Nova Tech. A flare of annoyance shot through him. "If you had just told me that you were the co-founder of Nova Tech, do you think I'd have gone after it? I had no idea. You kept it all from me."

Back then, he had only pressured Felix's company in hopes of making Hannah give up on the divorce. He had no clue she and Felix were partners in business.

Hannah felt like rolling her eyes. The way Vincent spoke made it sound as if knowing the truth would have changed his actions, as if he wouldn't have targeted Nova Tech. She remembered exactly how things happened-he went after Nova Tech for Brinley's sake. Bitterness colored her thoughts.Selective memory.

"Well, it's a good thing I kept it to myself. If you hadn't pushed us so hard, Nova Tech wouldn't have grown as quickly as it did," Hannah said, her voice thick with sarcasm.

Vincent could feel the sting in her words, and he struggled to come up with a comeback.

Miles's eyes moved from Vincent to Hannah, and he lifted an eyebrow with interest. "So, you two... You were together before? Boyfriend and girlfriend?"

"He's my ex-husband." "She's my ex-wife." Their voices overlapped.
###Chapter 157 How Miserable | TrulyWas Those Five Years
In perfect sync, both Hannah and Vincent spoke up.Their eyes locked for a moment before they turned away, almost as if caught off guard.

A realization hit Miles. He finally picked up on the awkward energy swirling between the two. For some reason,Hannah intrigued him even more. At first, his mind had painted her as someone hoping to land a wealthy partner. Instead, she left Vincent and helped launch Nova Tech as a founding partner.

Checking her watch, Hannah didn't want to keep Felix waiting. "I need to get going. Would you mind giving us a moment, Mr. Jones? The paperwork with Mr.Whitaker should be quick,"

Refusing to move, Vincent kept his spot near Miles'desk. "I'm not going anywhere. Miles already pointed out that I am not an outsider," he said. Taking the opportunity to ease the mood, Miles guided Hannah toward the coffee table so they could finish signing the contract.

The moment her eyes landed on the clause for an extra $10 million investment, her surprise was clear."Where did this come from?" she asked.

With a thoughtful tone, Miles laid out the company's reasoning. "We have faith in the product, which is why that investment is in the contract."

Hannah could not help but admire his insight.Satisfied after reading through the contract, she signed her name and extended a handshake. "I look forward to collaborating with you, Mr. Whitaker."

Returning the gesture, Miles replied, "The feeling is mutual," and shook her hand.

That small interaction caught Hannah off guard. She had been expecting him to keep his distance, not greet her with a handshake. Clearly, becoming a business partner changed things-Miles was noticeably warmer.Once the contract was signed, Hannah made for the exit. That was when Vincent reached his limit.Without warning, he seized her wrist and ushered her into the room next door.

Still basking in the rush of her recent win, Hannah did not see it coming.

The adjoining room was a meeting space. Vincent wasted no time, closing the door behind them and turning the lock.

Annoyance flashing across her face, Hannah jerked her arm free. "What exactly do you think you're doing?"

Even Vincent was surprised by his own impulsive behavior. A moment ago, he had watched her trade smiles with Miles, easy and warm,while she treated him like a stranger. That sharp contrast had burned in him. In a burst of feeling, he had dragged her away.

Now, with her staring him down, words failed him. His lips parted as if to speak, but nothing came out at first."I..." She massaged her wrist, leveling a cold glare at him."If you're about to ask me to let Brinley off the hook,you can forget it."

His expression soured. "Who said anything about Brinley?"

Without another word,Hannah brushed past him,heading for the door. "Then I'm leaving."

A series of scenes replayed in Vincent's mind-Hannah's brilliant stage presence, her self-assured smile, and the image of her working closely with Felix, day after day. He could not stand the idea.

Planting himself between her and the door, he caged her in with his arms.
She gave his chest a push, but he would not budge.Abandoning the effort, she simply met his gaze,icy and unblinking, as if daring him to try something new.

A heaviness settled in Vincent's tone as he finally gave voice to the question that had haunted him ever since Hannah's pitch. "Why did you keep your
business plans a secret from me? If you had just said the word, do you honestly think I wouldn't have supported you? Imagine what you could've built if you'd had the Jones Group behind you, instead of relying on Felix."

He couldn't get it. Five years of marriage had gone by, and never once had she spoken of starting her own company. Yet, the ink was barely dry on their divorce papers before she founded one with another man.

Hannah's shoulders slumped with exhaustion. "It's all in the past. No point bringing it up."

But Vincent wasn't letting it go. "What if I insist you explain it?"

With a flash of anger in her eyes, she snapped back,"During those five years of our secret marriage,were you even aware of how your colleagues saw me? I heard every whisper-calling me your mistress,saying I couldn't get a proper job, painting me as some gold-digger feeding off your wealth." Deep creases formed across Vincent's brow. "I kept our relationship quiet for your sake. Didn't you always insist you didn't care about anyone else's opinions?"

He had assumed that keeping the marriage under wraps meant freedom for her-that she wouldn't be hounded by the media wherever she went, nor be obligated to attend social functions by his side.

A bitter laugh escaped Hannah as she met his gaze."You keep telling yourself you did it for me, but in the end, you stood back and watched while people tore my reputation apart. And now you want to know why I never told you about starting a company? If I had accepted your help or let your name near my company, no one would've ever believed I earned my place. I would've always been the woman you kept hidden for half a decade."

Although Hannah spoke evenly, the fury simmering beneath her words could not be missed. "You have no idea how much those rumors hurt me. There were days I wouldn't even dare to leave my own home.So  many nights passed without sleep, replaying every cruel thing people said. The doctor eventually diagnosed me with moderate depression. If it hadn't been for Rena helping me, I might never have found my way back. And you-where were you then, the man I married?"

A painful ache spread through Vincent's chest.His reply came out rough and low. "When did this happen?"

Shrugging, Hannah gave him a tired look. "Does any of it really matter now?" she asked, her voice distant."You've just reminded me how miserable I truly was those five years we spent together."

Holding his gaze, she asked, "Are you still going to stand in my way?"

For a moment, he could not move. At last, he stepped aside, rigid and silent.

Nothing else needed saying. Hannah pulled open the door and left him behind. Left alone, Vincent lingered in the empty room,collecting himself before returning to Miles's office,his features arranged in a mask of composure. He sat back down in front of the desk. "Do you have the contract ready?" he asked.
###Chapter 158 We're Just Colleagues


"Certainly. Review this, Mr. Jones." Miles extended the contract toward Vincent.

Vincent skimmed through the pages and scribbled his signature with mechanical fluidity. "The funds should reflect within forty-eight hours."

Miles, typically not one to pry, couldn't help but ask,"Is there a reason you're funneling ten million into Nova Tech under VitraMind's banner?"

Vincent pressed his fingers to his forehead,weariness dragging down his features. "Had it come from Jones Group, she would've rejected it outright."

There was no doubt about the identity of "she"-it was Hannah.

Miles gave a light laugh. "Mr. Jones, that's awfully thoughtful of your ex-wife."
Vincent simply announced, "I'm heading out."

After exiting the building, Vincent spotted Derek already by the curb. "Where did Brinley go?" he questioned.

"Miss Gilbert returned on her own," Derek responded with formality. "Back to the office, Mr. Jones?"

Vincent gave a clipped order. "Home."

As the vehicle moved forward in silence, Vincent abruptly asked, "Derek, were you ever aware of the gossip in the company about Hannah?"

"Could you clarify?" Derek replied, a littlepuzzled.

"They'd say things like... Referring to her as 'my mistress'..." Vincent trailed off, the words bitter in his mouth.

Derek replied candidly, "Since your marriage to Ms.Scott was kept private, most assumed the worst.You gave no statements, and the narrative took over."

Vincent's eyes darkened. "Were the comments...  harsh?"

"To be honest, some were downright cruel. Yet, Ms.Scott wore the same composed expression, like nothing touched her." Derek observed Vincent in the rearview mirror, stopping short of saying too much.

Silence crept back into the space between them.After a beat, Vincent murmured, "Did you know she had depression?"

Derek's reaction was visible. "No. Should I investigate?"

Vincent's voice sharpened. "Hadn't I told you to look after her while I was away?" His frustration boiled over, though he couldn't articulate the cause. His tone turned brittle and tense.

Derek quickly defended himself. "Mr. Jones, you asked me to provide support if Ms. Scott reached out. She rarely did-only when she couldn't get hold of you. Otherwise, she stayed distant."

After a pause, Vincent found something else to criticize. "Ms. Scott, Ms. Scott... Who said you should stop calling her 'Mrs. Jones'?"

"She instructed me to stop using that title," Derek replied cautiously. "It felt odd initially, but I adapted."

"That's enough. Just drive. No more talking." Vincent shut his eyes, drained.

"Understood, Mr. Jones."

Moments later, Vincent spoke again. "Soon, the press might catch wind of my separation from Hannah."

"I'll handle it discreetly," Derek responded instantly.

"Don't suppress it," Vincent said, his eyes now open."Let it spread. Understood?"

"Understood. But trying to right wrongs now? Might be a bit late..." The words escaped before Derek could stop them.

"Shut it."
Derek zipped his lips theatrically without further comment.

At Nova Tech, Hannah and Felix formally unveiled the thrilling development of VitraMind's collaboration,and the update was immediately shared with the team on Dace Island.

Regarding Evan, Hannah had already dispatched someone to gather concrete proof. An update was imminent.

Relief swept through the staff-employment remained intact, for the timebeing.

"Does this mean we're advancing to Al integration for the 4.0 wristband?" Sophie asked, lifting her hand,eyes gleaming.

"Precisely! Things are only going to escalate from here. But..." Hannah's voice took on an intriguing lilt."Before diving in again, the company's treating you to a two-day retreat at the Maravelle Islands. All expenses paid." "Are you serious?" The group stared in amazement-the gesture was entirely unexpected.

Hannah nodded enthusiastically. "Absolutely! And we know it's hard to relax with supervisors nearby, so Felix and I won't be attending."

"Ms. Scott, you're amazing!" The office erupted with applause and celebration. Spirits soared.

Watching the excitement, Hannah and Felix shared a contented glance.

Someone joked from across the room, asking,11SO1does that mean you and Mr. Wade are locking yourselves in the office instead?"

"Hardly-we've got our own plans," Hannah replied slyly, her smile teasing.

Felix's head tilted slightly as he looked at her, a grin sneaking in while his pulse quickened.

The vague response fueled another round of playful speculation and giggles.To dispel the buzz, Hannah raised her voice. "Don't get ideas-Felix and I are colleagues. That's all."

Felix's expression dimmed momentarily, a flicker of sadness crossing his face.

No one was convinced, and the teasing persisted with laughter.

Hannah finally tugged Felix by the wrist and pulled him into her office-it was the only place that offered peace.

"What's the matter?" Felix asked, sounding a little down.

Hannah showed him her phone screen. "Didn't I promise you a getaway? I've already reserved the flights-we're going to Elaria.Well?"

Felix's eyes sparkled. "You remembered that?"

"Of course. I always retain what matters to people,"Hannah replied warmly. She meant every word.

"No wonder you were glued to your screen in the car. You were booking this!" Felix took her phone gently,his mood visibly lifted.

When he stared at it too long, Hannah made a fake grab for it. "You seem unimpressed. Should I cancel everything?"

"Who said that? I'd love to go on a trip with you."

·Their eyes locked-and in that second, Felix could've sworn galaxies shimmered in hers-luminous and endless.

His gaze was too intense, and Hannah had to be the one to turn away first.
###Chapter 159 Hannah's Three Posts


Vincent dragged himself back to the Jones family estate, every muscle aching with fatigue. All he wanted was a few hours of oblivion, but the instant he sank into bed, his mind ignited with restless turmoil. No matter how he tossed and turned, sleep wouldn't come. By sunrise, he gave up entirely and drove to the office, shadows etched beneath his eyes.

He'd barely stepped into the building before he felt the fallout. News of his marriage-and the recent divorce-from Hannah had exploded overnight,dominating every headline and gossip feed.

Acting on Vincent's instructions, Derek unleashed an aggressive PR offensive, ensuring the story blazed across every major outlet.

Soon, Brinley's social media accounts were inundated with angry messages. Accusations of being a homewrecker flooded in by the minute.

Staring at her phone in disbelief, Brinley watched her name shoot to the top of the trending charts, her pulse spiking as outrage and panic warred inside her.

The idea of Hannah basking in the chaos only made Brinley's blood boil hotter. She snapped her fingers for her PR team and barked out new orders, insisting they bury the story no matter what it took.

All the while, Clive kept spamming Brinley's phone with frantic texts, demanding to know about Hannah's divorce from Vincent. After all, what Brinley had fed him was that Vincent was single, and Hannah was just a desperate woman latching onto Vincent.

Every notification made Brinley's temples throb. If Clive wasn't still marginally useful, she would've chewed him out then and there. Still, she fired off a curt voice message, her irritation unmasked. "How would I know they got married in secret? But why are you panicking? They're divorced now, and I'm the only one fit to be Vincent's wife. Got it?" Clive replied right away, practically groveling."Crystal clear, Miss Gilbert-I've always got your back."

.As the divorce news exploded across the internet,gossip spread through every corner of the Jones Group.

For the first time, Vincent had truly overheard the way his employees whispered about Hannah. No matter how quietly they tried to lower their voices-or how abruptly they fell silent when he walked by-he still picked up enough snatches to know she was at the center of it all. If he'd ever bothered to pay attention before, he might have realized just how vicious their comments had always been. But in five years, he'd never cared enough to listen.

When he finally reached his office,he tried drowning himself in paperwork, hoping to numb the chaos in his mind. After three fruitless hours, he was still staring blankly at the same page. The cutting-edge efficiency that once defined him had completely deserted him.
Restless, he kept searching for some scrap of evidence-some half-forgotten moment-that would prove Hannah had been happy with him, even once,during their marriage.

Suddenly, he remembered his private social account.He'd created the account solely for Hannah, back when she accused him of never giving her enough attention. But as the months wore on and work buried him, her mentions faded away, and so did his attention.

Now, though, maybe that her page still held a trace of the happiness he'd missed. Maybe, tucked somewhere in those snapshots, he could finally find what he'd failed to see.

He stared at the login screen, frustration building with every failed attempt-until, finally, he stumbled on the right password.

Inside, he went straight to the lone name on his  following list: Hannah.

The moment her profile loaded, a sharp ache twisted through his chest.

There were only three posts.

The latest was a stark black-and-white shot of the sky, uploaded two years ago. Her caption tugged at him: "It was thanks to a good friend that I made it out. I want to believe I'm fine now, but am l?"

The second post hit him like a punch to the chest.Unlike the others, it burst with color-a vivid, jarring shot of her palm smeared with blood, fist clenched around glittering shards of glass. The caption beneath it read, "I could feel the glass slicing my skin, but oddly enough, there was no pain."

Vincent's breath snagged in his throat. His fingers shook as he stared at the screen. While Hannah had been suffering from depression, even hurting herself,what had he been doing?

He glanced at the date on the post, but his mind came up empty-he couldn't even remember where he'd been, what had seemed so important at the time.

The oldest post dated back four years: a grainy black-and-white selfie, her features eerily calm. The caption was like a splash of cold water. "This could pass for a halfway decent funeral photo."

If he hadn't happened across these hidden pieces of her pain, Vincent might never have known-Hannah had been fighting depression alone for two years.

He hovered on her page, drawn in by the emptiness of those three lonely posts. After a long moment, he switched over to see who she followed.

Rena's profile popped up first. He tapped in, scrolling through a flood of selfies and daily updates-nothing about Hannah, not a single mention. He exited without a second thought, only to spot another name that jumped out at him-Felix Wade.

Vincent clicked through. The latest post was a single,unmistakable photo: two airplane seats side by side. He recognized Hannah immediately, even with only her profile visible beside Felix.

The caption stopped him cold. "Just the two of us.This trip's going to be perfect."

A shadow passed over Vincent's face. His jaw tightened as a wave of jealousy churned in his chest.
###Chapter 160 A Dream Fulfilled


Vincent abandoned his phone and headed straight for the Lakeshore Villa, making his way to the room Hannah once lived in.

Inside, the walk-in closet was barren-her clothes had vanished, leaving only a row of his untouched suits. Her vanity was stripped of all traces of her daily rituals. The room, once warm with her presence, felt hollow and cold.

But one drawer remained. It was locked.

With no key in sight, Vincent forced it open.

A heap of pill bottles spilled out, rattling across the floor. The label "Fluoxetine" glared up at him-impossible to ignore.

He grabbed a bottle and turned it over in his hand,reading the single word: antidepressant. His breath hitched. The thought of Hannah clinging to these pills, enduring those two years in silence,made his lungs constrict. He sucked in a shaky breath and then dialed for the housekeeper.

Helen Turner, the housekeeper, rushed in,her breath catching as she spotted the scattered bottles. "Mrs.Jones told me to throw those away. She even explained where the key was, but I completely forgot."

Vincent sat motionless at the vanity, shoulders tense,his eyes locked on the tabletop. "Did you ever know she was ill?"

Helen's brows drew together in confusion. "Mrs.Jones always seemed perfectly healthy. She never even caught a cold. I just assumed those pills were for her immune system."

A cold heaviness settled over Vincent's features. No one had realized Hannah once suffered from depression. Not a single person had seen the truth,not even him-he'd bought her story about nightly supplements without question. "Take your leave. The bottles stay," Vincent muttered, his voice low and distant.

Helen replied with a nod, "Got it."

Vincent's gaze lingered on the heap of pill bottles,his chest tightening with a guilt so sharp that it nearly choked him. All this time, Hannah had fought her battles alone, drowning in shadows he'd never even noticed. The realization hollowed him out. He needed to move. Do something-anything-before the grief swallowed him whole.

Instinctively, Vincent reopened Felix's latest Instagram post. Felix and Hannah were now in Elaria.
After a heavy pause, Vincent hit Clive's number.

"The Elaria deal we've been working on-I'm going to handle it in person," Vincent rasped, his throat raw with emotion.

Clive sounded uncertain as he replied, "But Mr.Jones, the team's already on the groundd..."

"Is that a problem?" Vincent's tone went flat, icy  enough to shut down any argument.

"N-no. No problem at all."

"Get the project files to me in ten," Vincent ordered curtly.

"Understood." Clive ended the call, still baffled, but didn't hesitate-he relayed the update to Brinley at once.

When Brinley first heard Vincent was flying out to Elaria, she barely reacted. To her,it sounded like just another work trip, nothing urgent.

Right then, Brinley was wandering through a trendy boutique with Daphne, making small talk about the upcoming pitch event. Brinley secretly hoped Daphne might pull some strings and give Polaris Tech another chance.

But Daphne just shook her head, her tone gentle but firm. "Honestly, I'm not happy about it either. Of all the startups my brother could've picked, why did he have to choose Hannah's? Yet, I was so annoyed by Hannah's presence that I skipped the presentation altogether. Was Hannah's presentation really that impressive?"

"Absolutely not!" Brinley shot back, her words a little too sharp. "Not even close." No way was she about to admit that Hannah could ever beat her.

"That's odd. My brother only ever makes decisions based on merit," Daphne replied, her tone light, not suspecting anything.

"I just froze during the pitch and messed up," Brinley remarked, adding a touch of self-deprecation."Otherwise, maybe Polaris Tech would've sealed the deal."

Her gaze sharpened as she added, "Daphne, would you mind talking to your brother for me? Maybe see if he'd reconsider and give us another shot?"

Daphne paused, uncertainty flickering in her eyes. "I can't guarantee anything, but I'l ask. He mentioned the Nova Tech crew is off on vacation, so maybe there's an opening." Brinley scoffed under her breath. "They're taking a break now, of all times? If it were me, I'd be grinding on that project."

Still, the idea sparked a sliver of hope. Maybe this was her chance.

Daphne tossed it out like it was nothing. "Yeah, I think they went to... Elaria or something?"

"Elaria?" Brinley stiffened, her eyes narrowing in a flash. She yanked out her phone, scrolling quickly to Clive's message-Vincent was on his way to Elaria,too. A jolt of suspicion prickled through her. Was Vincent really flying out for business, or was he chasing after Hannah?

Brinley had jumped through hoops for the VitraMind deal, all to win Vincent's appreciation and finally erase those shadows of judgment.

But now, Vincent and Hannah had landed in the same country? The thought made Brinley's chest tighten.

For a moment, Brinley said nothing, her thoughts tumbling one over another. She knew Vincent still hàrbored old grudges. If she tailed him now, he'd only resent her more. But if she just happened to turn up-like it was a spur-of-the-moment girls'trip-that was something else entirely. She snapped out of it and turned to Daphne with a sudden smile. "What do you think about a getaway? My treat. Why not Elaria?"

Daphne's eyes fluttered in surprise. "Weren't we just talking about my brother and that business deal?"

Brinley's lips curved in a sly grin. "We'll get to that.But you've helped me out so much lately-this is my treat."

Daphne shrugged, flashing a breezy smile. "Sounds good.I'm free anyway."

"In that case, let's head out tonight." Brinley slipped her arm through Daphne's, her gaze sharpening with hidden intent. Meanwhile,Hannah had wanted her parents to join the getaway, but after they heard she'd be traveling with Felix,they politely bowed out.

Once Hannah and Felix touched down in Elaria, they dove straight into the city's charm, checking into a charming little guesthouse tucked away from the bustle,eager to soak up every bit of local culture.

The two of them lingered in thecourtyard, the night sky stretching wide overhead, their voices threading quietly through the warm air.

Felix glanced over, a flicker of gratitude in his eyes."Thanks," he murmured. "I honestly didn't think you'd remember."

Hannah shot him a questioning glance, her brow slightly furrowed.

He let out a soft laugh and looked skyward, the starlight flickering in his eyes. "I didn't think you'd remember I love Elaria."

Years ago, he'd blurted it out in public-"I love Elaria. I want to come here someday-with someone l love"-but Hannah had missed the second half,whisked away by a phone call.

Now, seated beside her in the hush of night,he realized this was it-his dream was fulfilled.
###Chapter 161 He Planned To Confess His Feelings For Her

Hannah smiled. "In that case, make the most of these next three days."

"Definitely," Felix replied.

But the next morning, when he knocked on her guesthouse room door multiple times, there was no response.

Felix didn't insist, knowing she had been exhausted lately. Instead, he spent the day sightseeing alone and didn't return to the guesthouse until around five in the evening.

Inside the lobby, Hannah was seated comfortably,chatting with a group of guests. Her head was slightly tilted back, her smile radiant, eyes sparkling with joy. She looked effortlessly captivating.

As if sensing someone's gaze, Hannah turned her head and scanned the room. Her eyes met his briefly,and in that fleeting second, Felix felt his heart skip a beat.

"You're back. I heard from the manager that you left early," Hannah said, stepping away from the group and walking toward him in a light blue dress.

"Yeah, I went out to explore a few spots," he replied,reaching for a glass of water and taking a few long sips.

"I think I overslept today," Hannah said, rubbing her temples. "Let's go out tonight."

"How about a cruise on the Comet River? I've heard it's one of the highlights here," Felix suggested.

Hannah's face lit up. "Sounds perfect. A cool night breeze would be lovely."

Felix nodded, the corners of his lips curving into a smile he couldn't hide.

Tonight's cruise on the Comet River featured a special wedding experience event. He hoped to share this experience with Hannah, a secret wish of his.He'd spoken to the guesthouse manager the day before to arrange a romantic setting. Once they returned from the cruise, he planned to confess his feelings for her.

***

Meanwhile, Vincent had just landed and gone straight to Hannah'slocation. He wanted to see her,yet the thought alone weighed heavily on him. Guilt wrapped tightly around his chest. He wasn't sure how to face her now.

As Andres Lopez, the project manager, led Vincent through an inspection of the facility, Vincent's expression grew darker by the minute, making Andres increasingly uneasy.

Andres suggested, "Mr. Jones, we've gone over most of the essentials. How about I take you to meet an old acquaintance?"

"An old acquaintance?" Vincent asked, puzzled. As far as he knew, he had no personal acquaintances in  Elaria-only business contacts. The only one who fit the description was Hannah, who happened to be traveling here. His eyes lit up. "She's here to see me?"

"Yes. I gave her the address," Andres replied,watching the subtle shift in Vincent's expression and sensing a rare opportunity to make a good impression.

"Take me to her." Vincent's tone shifted, urgency replacing confusion. If Hannah had gone so far as.to track him down in a foreign country, something serious must have happened.

Andres quickly led the way to the reception area.

But instead of Hannah, they found Brinley and Daphne waiting.

Vincent's brows furrowed. "What are you two doing here?"

Andres blinked, startled. Wasn't Brinley supposed to be Vincent's fiancée? Then why did Vincent's  expression turn colder upon seeing her?

Daphne turned away with a scoff. If not for Brinley's persistence, she wouldn't have bothered facing Vincent's frostbitten mood again. She still nursed a grudge against him from the previous incident.

Brinley greeted Vincent warmly, "Daphne and I are on holiday. When we heard you were here on business,we thought we'd stop by to see you."

Vincent replied coldly, "I see."

"Vincent, am I bothering you?" Brinley asked, her voice tinged with grievance.

He didn't respond.

Seeing the tension rise, Andres quickly jumped in."Oh, no, not at all. Mr. Jones has been swamped since he landed-he hasn't even had time to rest properly. The remaining work is mostly wrap-up tasks. I can handle them."

Vincent turned to him, his gaze sharp. "Since when did you start managing my schedule?"
"I-I didn't mean to overstep-I just thought you could use a break," Andres stammered, sweat forming on his forehead. "There's a special event on the Comet River cruise tonight. Would you like me to reserve tickets?"

Daphne lit up immediately and tugged on Brinley's arm. "Let's go. It sounds fun!"

"Vincent, come with us. You need to relax a little,"Brinley urged,watching him closely.

Andres added, "Yes, Mr. Jones. Don't worry about work. I'll handle everything."

Vincent gave a quiet nod. His mind was in chaos, and a distraction, any distraction, could help him think things through.
###Chapter 162 We're Not A Couple


Above the Comet River, lights from the cruise ship cast a golden haze across the night. On the bow stage, a local group played music, their vibrant tunes and pounding beats thrilling the guests. Everyone moved with the rhythm.

Hannah was dressed in a gown the color of deep teal, her hair swept up with casual grace.

Felix kept sneaking glances at her, wanting to invite her for a dance, but each time he extended his hand,he hesitated and pulled it back.

Just then, Hannah grabbed his hand. "Come on.Let's dance."

Felix glanced at their linked fingers, a bright grin forming on his face.

There were no set steps-only spontaneous movement. She was sometimes flirtatious, sometimes playful, and Felix's gaze was full of admiration, affection, and a hint of nervous anticipation.

Right now, he was dancing with the woman he adored, beneath the stars during a Comet River voyage. A scene he'd never imagined for himself.

"Does this make you happy?" he asked.

"So much!" Hannah replied, her expression alight with joy.

Meanwhile, Brinley and Daphne made their way toward the dancing event, tugging Vincent behind them.

Vincent instantly noticed Hannah and Felix amid the dancers. His mood turned sour.

"This sucks. Let's leave," Brinley mnuttered and grabbed his hand, clearly trying to distract him from the sight of Hannah.

Vincent jerked his hand away from hers. "I'll stay a while."Daphne, too, had caught sight of the couple in the spotlight and remarked, "Hannah and Felix look fantastic together."

Vincent shot her a cold glance. She fell silent at once.

Vincent remained near the dance area, his stare locked onto Hannah.

Then, as the melody hit its peak, Hannah spun like a breeze.Her teal-blue gown fanned out like a blossom mid-bloom, tracing a graceful swirl in the air.

And in that second, her eyes happened to land on Vincent. Surprise flickered through her features, but she quickly steadied herself. No biggie. She would just act like he was a stranger.

Cheers rang out around them.Hannah and Felix gave a bow and quietly stepped away from the dancing crowd.

The band kept playing, and others stepped up to join.

Vincent marched toward Hannah. "Well... This is unexpected," he said after a pause, managing nothing better.

He was full of thoughts-wanted to ask about her meds, her health, and offer help. He wanted to say sorry. But none of those phrases would come out.

Hannah's brows furrowed slightly. What was wrong .with him?

Felix, noticing her tension, moved up. "Mr. Jones,we've got other things to do. Please excuse us."

Suddenly, Vincent gripped Hannah's wrist and tugged her nearer. "Can we talk?"

Above them, on the second deck, a host was scanning the crowd for a pair to feature in a marriage ceremony segment.

A spotlight swung across the lower area,sweeping over guests.

Just as Vincent ended his question, the beam stopped-squarely on him and Hannah. Just as Hannah tried to yank her hand free, the host's voice boomed. "What a stunning young duo!Absolutely perfect-congratulations to you both for being selected for our marriage celebration experience! Our crew will now welcome them!"

Hannah froze for a second and then urgently replied,"We're not-"

But the host ignored her completely.

The music switched to an upbeat tempo.

A cheerful crowd of cruise staff hurried down,gleefully guiding Vincent and Hannah along.

Hannah resisted every step of the way.

One staff member gave her a comforting smile. "No worries-just relax and enjoy the moment!"

"She's here with me!" Felix shouted repeatedly,trying to be heard, but the noise drowned him out.

Brinley, of course, had seen it all, but she couldn't push her way through the crowd. All she could do was watch in bitter frustration as Vincent was led away.

Hannah, utterly lost in the moment, was brought up to the second floor, where stylists dabbed on powder and arranged an orange veil over her hair.

"Orange means joy in our culture," one of the stylists said while adjusting the veil. "You look breathtaking."

Hannah replied earnestly, "You all look wonderful too -but I swear I'm not married to that guy. Please pick a real couple instead."

She attempted to rise, but the stylist gently eased her back down. "Ah, you two must've had a fight,right? Happens all the time-couples argue and then deny they're even married. But the gentleman outside showed us the wedding ring."

Immediately, Hannah held up her hand. "See? No ring! He and I are truly not a couple!"
###Chapter 163 The Accidental Kiss


"Did you toss the ring after an argument? There's still a faint mark from the ring on your finger. Trust me,once you've experienced our wedding rituals, you two will patch things right up, the stylist said with a knowing grin as she draped the veil over Hannah's head.

An overwhelming sense of irritation washed over Hannah.

Two staff members held Hannah firmly by each arm and guided her forward from behind the curtain.

Her eyes met Vincent's, and she instinctively looked away. Every part of her wanted to bolt, but the staff edged her even closer to Vincent.

Onstage, the host enthusiastically announced,"Groom, now's your moment, lift the bride's veil!"

The crowd responded with enthusiastic applause, eager for the spectacle.

Vincent drew in a steadying breath and carefully peeled back the delicate veil.

As the orange-tinted fabric slipped away, Hannah met his eyes with a frozen, unreadable stare.

Hannah then turned to the host, voice sharp. "Is that it? Can I go now?"

Unfazed, the host kept the energy high. "Our bride's in a hurry tonight! But before you leave, let's have the couple exchange floral bracelets. These beautiful pieces are handmade by our team, real flowers, just for you."

Hannah wasted no time, slipping the bracelet onto Vincent's wrist like she was checking off a chore.

Vincent, on the other hand, took his time. "Doesn't this feel a bit like our wedding day, exchanging rings?"

"Not even close. Let's just finish this." Hannah thrust her hand toward him, but Vincent unexpectedly caught her wrist, his fingers tracing gentle circles along her skin. Luckily, there wasn't even a hint of injury, and he let out a quiet breath of relief.

Hannah snatched her hand away and shot him a wary look. "Can't you just put it on? Why the extra touching?"

Vincent offered an apologetic shrug. "I got distracted. Sorry about that."

Vincent grabbed her hand and slipped the bracelet onto her wrist.

As soon as they'd swapped bracelets, the host beamed. "Now, for the most exciting part of all-let's see a kiss to mark this special occasion!"

Chants of "Kiss! Kiss!" erupted from the audience,fueling the excitement.

Off to the side, Brinley and Felix looked thoroughly displeased.

Hannah immediately stepped away and then firmly answered, "That won't be necessary." Vincent was quick to back her upo. "I'll respect her wishes."

At that moment, the host lost his footing and "accidentally" collided with Vincent.

The momentum carried Vincent straight into Hannah,and his lips brushed against hers before either of them could react.

Both Hannah and Vincent froze in shock, wide-eyed and stunned.

A warm tingle lingered on Hannah's lips, while Vincent could hardly steady his own breathing as his heartbeat thundered in his chest.

The crowd responded with wild applause, celebrating the moment.

Not missing a beat, the host amped up the excitement. "Let's give the happy couple a little more time together!"

Under the stage lights, the orange veil danced in the air, casting a soft glow over the pair, making them seem like a perfect match in that fleeting moment.

Daphne watched, caught up in the magic of it all,but quickly leaned over to Brinley, who was clearly upset.She whispered, "Don't let it bother you, Brinley.It's all just for show."

Brinley pursed her lips, saying nothing, her gaze toward Hannah increasingly resentful.

Hannah snapped out of her daze, immediately shoving Vincent aside and retreating, scrubbing at her lips with obvious disgust.

Vincent frowned, clearly irritated. "It's not like this was our first kiss, you know."

Hannah shot him a cold glare while wiping her lips again. "I just want nothing to do with you."

"A simple kiss and you think we're suddenly connected? Didn't know you were so old-fashioned,"Vincent couldn't help but tease.

Hannah didn't hesitate to fire back. "Believe whatever you want. The truth is, my mood soured the  moment I saw you tonight."

Reaching up, she tried to pull off the veil herself.

Suddenly, Vincent's teasing expression vanished,replaced by a serious look. "Don't you see how romantic this is? We're freshly divorced, and here we are, roped into a wedding ceremony together.Maybe the universe is sending a message."

"Nonsense. Our story ended, and that's that,"Hannah retorted, her voice sharp as glass.

Vincent's mood soured, his expression hardening.

Hannah continued trying to remove the veil in vain.

Noting her frustration, Vincent chimed in, "Looks like you could use your ex-husband's help right about now."

Hannah ignored him completely and turned to the staff for assistance instead.

But the staff only shook their heads. "Sorry, the rules say the 'groom' has to take off the veil."A bitter laugh escaped Hannah. This whole situation was beyond ridiculous.

Hearing the staff's instructions, Vincent marched over to Hannah and, without hesitation, reached behind her neck. "Let me handle it," he said.

Hannah frowned, her patience thinning. "Then hurry up."

Vincent leaned in, fumbling with the veil, clearly unfamiliar with how it was secured.

Annoyance prickled at Hannah's scalpas the tugging became uncomfortable. "Are you sure you even know what you're doing?"

Once again, she turned to the staff for help, but they simply gestured for her to be patient and wait.

"Just a second," Vincent muttered, his breath warm against her ear, pushing her patience past its limit.

"That's enough," she snapped, pushing Vincent away. "I'll keep the veil on." Her words were directed at the staff this time. Lifting her dress, Hannah strode forward, then turned to the staff and declared, "I don't need anyone else to give me happiness. I can make it on my own."

The staff stood frozen in surprise as Hannah dashed off, the veil trailing behind her like a burst of color.

Noticing the growing tension, the host quickly jumped in to ease things. "Okay, that concludes our activity. Let's hear it for our pair tonight!"

All eyes followed Hannah as she left. Her steps were light, the blue-green fabric of her dress swirling around her legs, while the orange veil fluttered behind her like a butterfly on the breeze.

Vincent couldn't look away, captivated by her defiant grace. Something inside him urged him to go after her. Before he knew it, he was moving, chasing after her without a second thought.

He caught up as Hannah, startled, collided with his chest. Rubbing her nose, she backed away, irritation flashing in her eyes. "What is it now?"Vincent locked eyes with her. "If this were an actual wedding,would you have said yes?"
###Chapter 164 You Actually Thought It Meant Anything
"You're insane! Go get help and stop bothering me!"Hannah said, her patience clearly at its limit.

Vincent took a step forward. "I'm serious."

Hannah let out a mocking laugh. "It was just an experience. You didn't actually think it meant anything,did you?"

"What if I indeed thought it meant something? That 'wedding'-it was beautiful."

Her face shifted, all amusement gone. "If I had the choice, I wish I'd never married you five years ago."

With that, she turned and walked off without another word.

Vincent remained rooted to the spot, the emotions that had surged just moments ago draining from him completely.

Felix spotted Hannah and hurried toward her.He cast Vincent a cutting glance before gently pulling Hannah to his side and guiding her away.

Seeing how tired she looked, Felix hesitated, then pulled out his phone and messaged the guesthouse manager. "Cancel the romantic setting for the confession of my feelings. We'll reschedule."



Brinley finally caught up with Vincent, only to find him standing there, visibly shaken and hollow. Oddly,that gave her a flicker of satisfaction.

Taking a breath, she stepped toward him and spoke gently. "Vincent, the ship's about to dock. I've already arranged a ride-why don't you come back to the hotel with us?"

"No need. I've got somewhere to stay." He had just booked a room at the same guesthouse as Hannah.

Brinley immediately perked up. "Where is it? We'll tag along.Honestly, it'd be safer for me and Daphne to have a guy around while we're traveling."

She looked over at Daphne.

Daphne gave a casual shrug. "I'm fine with wherever,as long as it's decent."

Clearly irritated, Vincent muttered the address without much thought.

Twenty minutes later, the ship docked.

Hannah and Felix disembarked immediately, heading straight for the guesthouse.

Right behind them, a car pulled up.

Brinley hadn't expected to run into Hannah again so soon. She was about to ask Vincent something when she realized he'd already stepped out of the car.

Hannah didn't look back. She walked into the guesthouse, turned to bid Felix goodnight, and was suddenly interrupted by a loud pop.

Colorful streamers shot into the air, leaving everyone  momentarily stunned.

The guesthouse manager stood frozen, staring at the scene in confusion.Why were there so many people here?

Felix quickly caught the manager's eye and subtly motioned toward his phone.

The manager quickly picked up his device and finally saw the message about the canceled confession.

At this point, Vincent stepped into the guesthouse and glanced around at the romantic setup. "Is this how you usually greet your guests?"

The manager quickly played along. "Y-Yes! It's our special welcome for new arrivals."

Daphne, not suspecting anything, pulled out her phone and snapped a few shots. "Kind of sweet,honestly."

Brinley didn't buy it for a second.

Hannah had zero interest in the theatrics. She walked straight to her room. Felix followed close behind.

Brinley tried to strike up a conversation with Vincent,but he was already heading upstairs, jaw tight and mood darker than ever.

Vincent barely got any sleep that night. The next morning, as he stepped out of his room, he saw Felix standing outside Hannah's door, handing her a neatly wrapped bouquet of yellow roses. They were the same flowers used in last night's setup.

Hannah's eyes lit up. "These are gorgeous! Where did you find them?"

Felix scratched the back of his neck, looking a little shy. "Saw the staff clearing everything out from last night's display. Figured they'd be thrown out, so 1salvaged them.You like them?"

"I love yellow roses." A smile spread across Hannah's face, soft and sincere. "Thank you, Felix."

They shared a quiet laugh-an intimate, lighthearted moment that immediately made Vincent's blood run  hot.

Vincent walked right between them, shooting a pointed look at the bouquet before storming off."Lousy wrapping job."

Hannah watched him disappear down the stairs and then murmured to Felix, "Ignore him. He's lost it."

·Felix wasn't bothered. He'd already reworked his plans with the guesthouse manager. Tonight, he would confess his feelings for her.
###Chapter 165 The Ability To Love Someone

Hannah had considered booking a different guesthouse, but since she and Felix were leaving the following day, she decided it wasn't worth the hassle.

Hannah and Felix spent the whole day out and didn't return until ten that night.

Just as they approached the entrance, the door swung open from the inside.

Felix assumed it was the manager and frowned slightly-hadn't he specifically asked to keep things quiet?

Instead, Vincent stepped into view, his expression stormy. "Do you have any idea how late it is?"

Irritation flickered across Hannah's face. She cast a glance behind her, checking to see if Brinley was nearby. "If you're looking for Brinley, you've got the wrong crowd. She isn't with us."

Vincent's frown deepened. "I'm talking to you." His gaze settled on Felix, and his tone turned sharp. "I'd figured someone had put my ex-wifeinto danger."

Hannah stared him down. "Relax. Felix is a far better person than you ever were. He wouldn't ditch me in the middle of nowhere and ask me to get a cab on my own. My life is none of your concern. Stay out of it."

That jab made Vincent pause, momentarily thrown back to the urgency of the situation that had forced his hand.

Sensing the tension, Felix stepped in and gently guided Hannah past Vincent. He wasn't about to let her waste another second on an old argument,especially not when he had something important to say. "Let's go inside."

Once at Hannah's door, Felix turned to her, a trace of nerves in his voice. "Remember before the bidding meeting, when I said I had something I needed to tell  you?"

"Of course, I remember. Should we discuss it now?"Hannah's expression shifted, expecting Felix to bring .up something work-related.

Felix looked her straight in the eyes. "Meet me in the garden in five minutes. I'll explain everything there."

Hannah didn't hesitate. "Alright. I'll just drop off my things and be right out."

As soon as Hannah stepped inside her room, Felix released a shaky breath. He dashed to his own room,ran a hand through his hair, and swapped his clothes for something more polished. Satisfied with his appearance, he made his way to the garden.

The moment Hannah arrived, she stopped in her tracks, taken aback by the sight.

Yellow roses filled the garden, each bouquet tucked with photos of her, turning the whole place into a collage of memories.

Seeing Hannah's surprise, Felix approached and gently guided her toward the center of the blooms.

A nervous smile flickered across Hannah's lips."What's all this for?"

It was impossible to pretend she still thought this was about work.

Felix met her gaze, his expression earnest. "There's something l've wanted to tell you for a long time.Even though we didn't go to the same university,working with you on that competition was the highlight of my student life. I couldn't pinpoint the moment I started falling for you. All I knew was that every day I got to see you, I felt so happy. I meant to confess my feelings for you in junior year, but you came to me, beaming, to say you'd found someone.So I kept quiet."

"Felix, wait-" Hannah started, but he quickly cut her off. "Please, let me finish. These feelings have been bottled up long enough."

Felix's eyes shone with sincerity. "Co-founding a firm with you was just an excuse to stay close to you. But when you got married and left, it felt like I lost you for good. We didn't speak for five years. I thought I'd finally moved on, until you came back into my life and told me about your upcoming divorce. Suddenly,everything came rushing back. Hannah, would you give us a chance? Will you be my girlfriend?"

Not far away, Vincent, who had wandered out to clear his head, caught every word, never expecting to stumble upon such a confession. His hands balled into fists, tension crackling in the air.

Just as he was about to step forward, Hannah's voice broke through the stillness. "I'm sorry!"

Felix's expression faltered. "What did you say?"

Running her fingers through her hair, Hannah looked uneasy. "Your honesty means a lot to me, Felix.You're the first person who's ever laid their heart out for me like this."

Vincent had never said such things to her. There might have been regrets in the past, but not anymore. Felix forced a weak smile. "Then why apologize?"

Hannah didn't shy away from Felix's gaze. "I can't say yes."

"Why not?" Felix asked, searching her face. "We've had some truly good times together these days,haven't we?"

Hannah dropped her eyes, taking her time before answering softly, "It's not about you, Felix. The truth is, my last marriage left scars I haven't healed from.I think l've lost the ability to love someone. I'm just not in a place for a relationship right now."

A wave of pain tightened in Vincent's chest, her quiet confession cutting deeper than he expected. How much pain must Hannah have endured to speak those words?
###Chapter 166 Not Getting Back Together With You
Hannah looked over at Felix. "We're better off as friends. And about what you've said earlier-l'll just pretend I didn't hear it."

Felix didn't flinch. "I understand you need time. I'm not expecting an answer now. Take all the time you need.I'll wait."

Hannah wrung her fingers together, visibly torn.

"If staying friends helps you feel more comfortable,then that's what we'll be. But when the time comes-if it ever does-when you're ready to try something new, I hope you'll consider giving me a chance."He offered a faint smile. "I mean, I'm not that bad,right?"

Hannah returned a small smile. "You're great."

"Then it's settled. And these," he said, holding out a bouquet, "they're for you. Beautiful flowers for a pretty woman. I had them arranged just for tonight."

Hannah didn't have it in her to refuse again. She accepted the bouquet, dazed, murmuring, "Thank you."

Felix smiled warmly. "That's like the third 'thank you'tonight. Just tell me goodnight."

She gave him a sincere smile. "Goodnight."

"Goodnight. I'll see you tomorrow." Felix turned and walked away, hands clasped behind his back in a feigned show of calm. But the moment he exited the garden, the disappointment on his face was impossible to miss.

Hannah sat down on the swing, bouquet resting in her lap, and let out a deep sigh.

Vincent, unable to hold back any longer, approached her.

Hannah hadn't expected anyone else to be around.She jolted, startled. Clutching her chest, she  frowned. "What the heck are you doing here?"



···

Brinley noticed Vincent's absence about an hour later. After reading his message, any desire to enjoy the rest of the evening vanished.

Daphne didn't want to leave yet, so Brinley returned to the guesthouse on her own.

Brinley knocked on Vincent's door first, but it was empty. Worried that he'd gone to look for Hannah again, she began frantically searching the guesthouse. When she finally spotted him in the garden with Hannah, her expression twisted with fury.

Vincent stood casually, leaning against a column roughly three meters from the swing. "Couldn't sleep," he said. "Came out for a walk and overheard your conversation with Felix."

"You've clearly got too much free time," Hannah muttered, standing up from the swing, ready to But before she could walk away, Vincent spoke again."About what had happened two years ago... I'm sorry..I didn't realize what you've been through. I saw the bottles in your drawer. If I'd known sooner, I wouldn't have let you go through it alone."

Hannah's face remained unreadable. "That's all in the past. There's no need to bring it up."

"There is," Vincent insisted. "You turned Felix down-doesn't that mean there's still a chance for us?I swear, I won't let you face anything alone again."

Brinley, eavesdropping from a distance, felt her blood boil. Was Vincent seriously trying to win Hannah back?

Hannah's eyes were sharp, her voice tinged with sarcasm. "A second chance? So you can break me all over again?"

"| wouldn't."

"Don't tell me you regret the divorce," Hannah said, lips curling into a bitter smile. She thought back to how strangely he'd been acting lately-asking if she'd ever marry him again, lecturing her for coming back late. It all made sense now.

"I indeed regret it," Vincent said, locking eyes with her. "I shouldn't have divorced you."

Since the day they separated, his emotions had been a whirlwind-mood swings he couldn't control, an endless frustration. He hated it.

Hannah let out a short laugh. "Just because I said no to Felix doesn't mean I'd ever go back to you. Every bit of pain I felt in our marriage came from you. You really think I would put myself through that again?Maybe you regret the divorce-l don't. Leaving you was the best decision I've ever made."

Vincent's heart clenched. "I can change. Everything you said-I'll fix it. Even Grandma thinks we should've never split."

"There it is-your grandmother again." Hannah scoffed. "Stop dragging her into this. I didn't divorce
###Chapter 167 Brinley Plotted Against Her Once Again
Vincent's throat rasped. "Couldn't you give me even one opportunity?"

'Hannah's response sliced through him. "An opportunity? Give you that? It's a miracle I don't despise you outright."

The frost in her tone struck like a dagger. Vincent masked the sting and regarded her intently. "Well then, regarding your moderate depression... Do you still need medical attention?"

At this, Hannah's expression shifted as if something clicked, and she scoffed. "So that's the root of your remorse-because you're guilty and eager to atone for it."

"I..." Vincent faltered.

Hannah stared through him. "Let me make this crystal clear. Regardless of your efforts, the wounds you've left can never be undone."

With that unflinching declaration, she pivoted and walked away.

Brinley observed Vincent's defeated posture, biting her lip with a quiet sigh before drifting off silently.She resolved right there and then that she would ensure Hannah stayed confined here forever, never crossing paths with Vincent again.

The thought lit a cold fire behind Brinley's gaze.

On the third morning at the guesthouse, Felix,haunted by rejection, barely caught a wink until daylight crept in. He remained asleep until late afternoon, waking only by five in the afternoon.

Upon waking, he skipped looking for Hannah and went straight to a tavern.

Brinley, who had been keeping tabs on him,silently trailed behind.

As she had suspected, Felix downed several strong drinks as soon as he arrived at the bar. He soon passed out.

Brinley seized the moment to grab his phone,.unlocking it smoothly using his fingerprint.

She located Hannah's contact swiftly, sent over a picture of the unconscious Felix, and then typed a message in the voice of a bartender. "Hi,are you close to this guy? He's blackout drunk here, and we couldn't get any address-mind picking him up?"

Brinley waited with calm anticipation for Hannah's response.

Five minutes later, she received a response from Hannah. "Hi, I know him. Kindly send the location. I'll be there."

Brinley shot back the location. "Mist Bar."

In truth, Felix was passed out in Haven Bar.

Mist Bar, wild and rowdy, was the most unruly spot Brinley had scouted the previous evening-nowhere near the guesthouse.After setting the trap, Brinley returned to the guesthouse.She arrived just as Hannah stepped out.

Brinley casually bumped into Hannah, causing 、Hannah's bag to fall to the floor.

"Oops, I'm such a klutz," Brinley said, crouching down and swiping Hannah's phone swiftly.

Hannah, distracted by worry for Felix, scooped up her things and rushed off without noticing.

Brinley's eyes gleamed with cruel satisfaction as she watched Hannah go.

"Hannah, don't take it personally-today's chaos is just your own doing," Brinley mused inwardly,lips curving in amusement.

Confirming that Vincent and Daphne weren't around,Brinley strode to the front desk and requested a key to Hannah's room, pretending to be Hannah's friend.Inside Hannah's room, she easily located the passport.

Peering at Hannah's passport, Brinley gave ascornful laugh before shredding it and flushing the pieces. She tossed all of Hannah's items into a suitcase without hesitation.

Back at the front desk, Brinley gestured to the case."She asked me to pack her stuff and handle checkout."

A few keyboard taps later, the receptionist nodded."All set, room 103 is cleared."

Brinley offered a polite thank-you. To erase the trail,she drove several miles and dumped the suitcase into a roadside bin. Now, returning wasn't an option for Hannah.


***

Hannah followed the map's guidance for what felt like forever before reaching Mist Bar.

The venue was chaotic, packed with unruly patrons.Inside,judgmental stares greeted her.

Swallowing her unease, Hannah scanned the crowd but saw no sign of Felix. She reached for her phone to call, but it wasn't in her bag. She was certain she'd taken it with her.

She froze, recalling the brief run-in with Brinley moments before her departure. It had to be Brinley.

With no phone and her bracelet left at home for servicing, Hannah turned to leave.

Suddenly, a hulking man with tattoos stepped in front of her. "Hey beautiful, why don't you join me?"

A chill raced through her veins as she managed a strained smile.
###Chapter 168 She Was In Trouble


Hannah steadied her nerves and said, "Looks like I came to the wrong place."

Without warning, the tattooed man grabbed,her purse, rifled through it with little interest, and then pulled her even closer. "No need to panic,sweetheart. I promise I won't hurt you. I'm a gentle guy."

Hannah tried to sound calm. "My friend's on their way.They'll be here any minute."

A deep laugh rumbled from the tattooed man. "Even better. More company means more fun for all of us."

No matter how hard Hannah resisted, he was simply too strong. She found herself pulled into a private room against her will.

Inside, the scene shifted: several women reclined on plush couches, and fit young men hovered nearby, ready to serve.

The tattooed man finally released his hold on Hannah and then addressed the woman in the center with deference, "She's here."

"Don't be scared, sweetheart. You're in good hands."The woman offered a sly smile. Her sharp features and dramatic makeup were impossible to miss, her attire bold and eye-catching. With a flirtatious tilt of Hannah's chin, she purred, "A face like yours is rare.Tonight's little visit of mine just got a lot more interesting."

Forcing herself to remain composed, Hannah asked quietly, "What do you want from me?"

"Wrong question, darling," the woman answered,though a threat lingered beneath her sweet words."You should be grateful. If itweren't for me, the wolves out there would've torn you apart."

Pretending to play along, Hannah asked, "Could I use your phone? I need to call someone." At this point, Vincent's number was the only one she could recall. Even if she had every reason to resent him, right now, he was the only person she could rely on.

The woman's lips curled into a meaningful smile. "Of course, sweetheart. But not just yet. Wait until morning, and then you can make your call. And by the way, I'm Paige Morphew."

With a quick wave, Paige left the room with her entourage,leaving Hannah alone.

Hannah headed for the door, only to find it locked tight-there was no way out. Her eyes darted around the space, landing on a security camera pointed squarely at her.



Daphne returned to the guesthouse.

Brinley wasted no time, pulling Daphne aside with an eager glint in her eye.

"Word is, Hannah packed up and left by herself," Brinley said, her eyes twinkling as if she'd uncovered juicy gossip. She emphasized the phrase "by herself"more than once.

"Is that unusual?" Daphne didn't quite catch her drift.

Leaning in conspiratorially, Brinley explained, "You have no idea! Felix confessed his feelings to her last night. She probably rejected him-said he wasn't good enough or something. Now the poor guy's drowning his heartbreak at a bar."

"Oh, now I get it!" Daphne's face lit up with curiosity."Brinley, where did you hear all this? You have to give me the scoop!"

Brinley spun the tale with a bit of flair and then shifted the conversation to their flights home the next morning, her gaze repeatedly darting toward the entryway.

Time passed as they lingered in the lounge, waiting,until Vincent finally wandered back in.

Brinley sprang up to greet him, immediately catching the faint trace of alcohol on his breath. "Vincent,actually, Daphne and I are heading out first thing in the morning. Why not join us? It's always safer to travél together."

"I'll stick around for a few more days," Vincent answered, though his eyes betrayed him as they lingered on Hannah's closed room door.

Brinley didn't miss his reaction as her hands curled unconsciously into fists.

"By then, it'll just be you and Felix left here!"Daphne's tone was playful.

Vincent looked puzzled. "What do you mean?"

"Hannah already left for home. Once we fly out,it'll just be you and Felix," Daphne answered plainly.

"Hannah already left?" Vincent repeated, his disbelief clear.

"That's right," Daphne confirmed with a nod.
A deeper crease formed between Vincent's brows. So Hannah was going out of her way to avoid him...His mood shifted, his voice low. "In that case, I'leave with you tomorrow."

A triumphant smile tugged at Brinley's lips. This was exactly why she kept Daphne close-no need to say anything herself, and no one would ever suspect her involvement.

Later that night, Felix stumbled back to the guesthouse,clearly wasted. He started pounding on Hannah's room door, his voice echoing down the hall."Hannah, open up! I'm not finished-I need to talk to you.Come on! Let me in!"

The commotion drew the attention of the front desk staff, who hurried over to intervene. "Sir, I'm sorry,but that lady already checked out."

"Checked out?" Felix blinked, the fog in his eyes clearing for a split second. So Hannah was avoiding him completely-she wouldn't even travel home together.

The realization sobered him instantly. With heavy steps, he trudged back to his own room, defeat written all over his face.

By the fourth morning, Felix, Brinley, and Daphne packed their bags and headed for the airport-everyone except Vincent.

The Elaria project hit an unexpected problem, forcing Vincent to take-charge and sort things out.

Brinley felt a wave of anxiety, but reminded herself this was a work problem-she had no right to meddle. Still, a flicker of relief surfaced. Hannah had been tricked into that unruly place, with no passport or a phone on her. There was no way Hannah could leave that place.

Meanwhile, Hannah hadn't dared to close her eyes all night, anxiety gnawing at her.

Just as dawn broke, Paige breezed into the room,smothering Hannah with exaggerated affection, even planting kisses on Hannah's cheeks. "My darling,you're  something else. I was right about you."She added a few more kisses for good measure,leaving Hannah bewildered. "Wait. What's happening?"
###Chapter 169 Learned Of Her Missing


Paige pointed at the surveillance camera."See that?Behind it are eyes-so many eyes-watching you."

She leaned in close to Hannah's ear and murmured,"And those people? They're not just anyone. You have caught the attention of a highly influential figure."

That was when Hannah realized-this wasn't a rescue. It was just another trap. "What you're doing is illegal!" she said, voice trembling as she jerked her hand free and stepped back.

Paige stayed composed. "Well, I always respect a lady's choice. It's a shame, really. But if you're unwilling, I won't force you."

She snapped her fingers, and the door to the private room creaked open. "I'll let you leave. Go ahead."
Hannah stood frozen. On the other side of the doorway were several men, their gazes sharp,watching her like hunters sizing up prey.

Paige examined her manicured nails, her tone casual."I'll count to three. If you're still here by then,I'll take it as a yes-you're staying."

"Three."

'Hannah's heart pounded.

"Two."

Hannah knew the moment she stepped through that door, she'd be subdued by those men, probably facing a far more grim fate.

"One."

Hannah realized she couldn't leave just yet. Playing along with Paige was the only way to survive.

Hannah drew a breath and steadied herself. "About what you've said... Is there any payment? I really need the money." She strategically portrayed herself as hungry for money and easily bought. Paige's smile returned. "Of course. You'll get what you're worth. Handle things well, and you won't just have wealth-you'll have power."

Hannah fidgeted with her fingers. "Alright... I'll do it.I just...I don't know how."

"I knew I wasn't mnistaken about you. You're wise.Don't worry-we'll train you." Paige tapped her nose."You'll be our star."

Hannah smiled faintly, all while quietly planning her escape.



Felix had not seen Hannah at work all day after he returned from Elaria. When she still didn't show up the next day, he sensed something was wrong.Even if she were avoiding him, she wouldn't ignore work.

He called her, but her phone was off. Concerned, he called her parents-only to learn she hadn't returned home.Panic took hold. If Hannah had returned from overseas, she would've gone straight to her family. Felix immediately reported it to the police and confirmed that Hannah hadn't crossed the border.She was still in Elaria. His chest tightened. There was no time for self-reproach for not double-checking her supposed departure. He immediately began reaching out to contacts for help.

Despite everything, Felix acknowledged that with Vincent's power, locating Hannah might prove easier.

Felix found Vincent's contact and called several times, only to be sent straight to voicemail. Left with no other option, he sent a message. "Hannah is missing."

Meanwhile, Vincent was on a private jet, mid-flight back home, when he saw the message. He called instantly. His voice was sharp. "What do you mean,Hannah's missing?"

Felix explained clearly, "She's still in Elaria. No one can reach her. You need to start looking."

Vincent didn't hesitate. "I'll find her."He ended the call and gave a cold order to the pilot."Turn the plane around. Head back to Elaria."

An hour later, Andres stood stunned at the airstrip.Hadn't he just seen Vincent off? Yet, there Vincent was again, striding down the steps of the jet.

Vincent didn't waste a second. He organized a search immediately and moved out with his security team. He couldn't sit still. Every moment counted.



For two days, Hannah remained locked inside a private room. Even bathroom breaks required an escort.

Paige's "training" was simply making Hannah watch disturbing videos on how to cater to powerful men,mentally draining and demoralizing.

On the third day, Hannah finally saw Paige again.

Paige entered the room with a flick of her wrist, and someone promptly switched off the surveillance camera. Paige pinched Hannah's cheek, smiling sweetly."Darling, today's lesson is the most important one-and I'm teaching it myself. So listen carefully."

、"Yes, I will," Hannah replied with a forced smile.

Paige's lesson was nothing more than a manipulative monologue, meant to wear down resistance and plant seeds of obedience.

After Paige finished, Hannah asked cautiously,"What's planned for tomorrow?"

Paige waved her hand, and someone stepped forward with a small pill. "This is a beauty supplement," she said.

Hannah took the pill without hesitation.

Paige grinned. "Oh, and it comes with a side effect.You'll need a monthly antidote, or you'll be in unbearable pain. And that antidote? Only I have it."

Hannah lowered her gaze. That was the weapon-how Paige controlled those wealthy women so completely. She poisoned them. "Tomorrow, I won't be the one escorting you.Someone else will deliver you to the gentleman."Then, Paige leaned in and whispered, "The bed there is very comfortable, I've tried it myself."
###Chapter 170 Took A Blade For Her


Paige's breath warmed Hannah's ear, yet it sent a shiver down her spine.

Suppressing her nerves, Hannah responded, "I hear you. Anticipate my update."

Determination flashed through Hannah's eyes.Tomorrow marked her single opportunity to flee! She had to seize it.

Paige exited with a sly grin, and the monitoring resumed.

Hannah faced away from the lens, faking interest in training footage, while stealthily retrieving the tablet tucked beneath her tongue and grinding it into fine dust with her thumb.


***

Vincent's men tapped the GPS of the cab  Hannah  once rode in to track down the Mist Bar and cross-checked their systemn to confirm an illicit deal was scheduled in a few days.

.They urged Vincent to remain composed. But Vincent was nearing his limit. He barged into the bar multiple times, always without spotting Hannah.

Then, on the second day, three vehicles departed the Mist Bar, each heading a separate way.

Vincent split his squad into three segments for pursuit.

Vincent and two of his men followed the third car.

Meanwhile, inside a vehicle, Hannah guessed the car had already driven far from the Mist Bar. She silently slipped off her slender belt, butas she attempted to raise her arm, she realized her energy was gone.

Her vision spun, and it dawned on her that, given Paige's cautious tendencies, she had been sedated to eliminate risk.

Still, this was her one opening-she couldn't let it vanish. She bit down on her lip, the metallic taste of blood sharpening her focus.

The two men ahead, perhaps thinking Hannah was incapacitated, had lowered their vigilance.

Hannah abruptly surged forward, wrapping the belt around the driver's throat, yanking hard, causing the ,car to jerk out of control.

Vincent and his team, noticing the erratic swerving,accelerated in pursuit. Through the window,Vincent spotted Hannah inside.

Vincent quickly drove ahead, maneuvering his car to force the other vehicle to a stop.

Hannah let go, disregarded the gasping driver, and pushed the door open to flee.

The man in the front passenger seat shook off his haze, snatched a blade, and gave chase.

Seeing Hannah through his mirror, Vincent leapt from his vehicle and dashed toward her.
The drug muddled Hannah's thoughts, but she sensed  footsteps gaining on her and forced herself onward.

The sounds behind her grew louder.

Her pursuer swung a blade, but she didn't see it coming.

Suddenly, a figure dashed in, pulling her close to take the hit in her place.

Red splashed across her face, blinding her. Still, she heard the voice calling "Hannah" over and over. That voice belonged to Vincent.

Before Hannah could respond, darkness overtook her,and she blacked out.

***

Two days on, inside a medical center, Hannah regained consciousness, jolting upright, fearing she had been relocated again.

Scanning the space, she noticed her hospital gown
and exhaled in relief. She was no longer in danger.

Then, the blade came to mind-the one from right before she passed out. It seemed Vincent had shielded her.

Not spotting Vincent, Hannah turned to the nurse changing her IV drip and asked, "Excuse mne, where's the person who came with me?"

The nurse thought a moment before replying, "He sustained grave injuries and is still in the ICU."

After the IV was changed, Hannah hesitated, but eventually asked about the ICU location and walked out with the drip stand.

Outside the ICU, she noticed a nurse covering someone with a sheet. The monitor beside the bed displayed a flatline, with all readings at zero.

Hannah froze, stunned.

The nurse spotted her and asked, "Are you his relative?"
Caught off guard, Hannah gave a dazed nod.

The nurse offered a gentle sigh. "He didn't make it.My condolences."

Hannah kept flashing back to that moment-falling into Vincent's embrace, hearing her name in his faint voice. His voice had sounded so fragile then. Was the wound deep enough to take his life?

Hannah stood still, unable to accept that Vincent was gone because of her.

The nurse asked, "Would you like a final moment with him?"

Hannah slowly shook her head, unable to handle the sight. "No,thank you."

Tears welling, she turned aside, her fingers loosening from the IV stand, lettingit slip downward.

Right then, a hand reached forward, steadying the stand.

Vincent's complexion was pale, but he managed a smirk. "Not dead yet. Save the tears for later."
###Chapter 171 He Still Held A Place In Her Heart
Hannah turned her head, wanting to wipe her tears,but when she noticed the IV line in her hand, she simply lowered it. "I wasn't crying," she said awkwardly.

Vincent turned his head, catching her expression. He leaned in slightly. "Your eyes are red. Still denying it?You were worried about me." It was a quiet, confident observation, delivered with a faint smile.

"I was just worried you'd drop dead in a foreign country and I'd be the one stuck claiming the body,"Hannah replied flatly, stepping back a few paces."Your grandmother would've been heartbroken."

"So you were indeed worried," Vincent said, the cloud hanging over him the past few days lifting in an instant. That stab wound? Totally worth it. His voice turned playful. "Doesn't that mean I still hold a place  in your heart?"

Hannah's brows drew together as she shot him a look. "Sounds more like the knife missed your stomach and scrambled your brain. That's the only way you'd come up with something so ridiculous."

Vincent didn't argue. He was in far too good a mood to be bothered.

Still, Hannah hadn't forgotten the scare earlier."Why weren't you resting? Why were you wandering around?"

"I didn't like the bed in that room," Vincent answered without hesitation, like it was the most reasonable explanation in the world. His gaze remained fixed on her. "So I had them move me to another room."

"You're completely spoiled," she muttered.

Vincent pointed to the bandage on his abdomen."The injury makes it hard to sleep. I figured a better bed might help."

Hannah narrowed her eyes. "And why exactly are you telling me this?"

"I just didn't want any more misunderstandings between us," he replied, eyes locked on hers, his tone serious. "From now on, if there's anything unclear, I'll explain it."

His voice was so sincere that it gave her goosebumps. She grabbed the IV bag from his hand."No need. I'm just your ex-wife. You don't owe me explanations."

Without waiting for a reply, she turned and walked back to her hospital room.

Vincent followed her, grinning. Then, without warning, he scooped her up into his arms.

Startled, Hannah squirmed as curious eyes from hospital staff and patients followed them.

"What are you doing?" Hannah squirmed, and Vincent winced with a hiss.

Hannah stopped struggling the moment she saw the pain flicker across his face. "Put me down," she whispered, voice trembling with urgency.

"Don't move. It hurts," Vincent said, his face pale.

"Then why on earth are you still carrying me?"

"I wanted to carry you back," he replied.

Faced with his stubbornness, Hannah had no choice but to let him.

Inside the hospital room, Vincent gently placed her on the bed and hooked up the IV bag.

The television was on, playing a news segment-Paige's face appeared on the screen. Mist Bar had been raided, and she was now a wanted fugitive.

Vincent's expression turned cold. His people had already alerted the authorities, but to him, the consequences still felt too lenient. Worried the broadcast might bring up painful memories for Hannah,he stepped over and turned off the TV.

When he didn't leave, Hannah gave him a look. "Why are you still here? Do you need something?" "I just tore my wound open again because of you,and now you want to kick me out?" Vincent said with a wounded expression.

.Hannah stared at him blankly. "Don't act like it was for me. You were just showing off."

Vincent had no comeback-but he didn't leave,either.

Seeing how stubborn he was being, Hannah decisively pressed the call button.

Vincent looked at her IV, assuming she must be feeling unwell.

A moment later, a nurse walked in with a new IV bag.She glanced up, clearly annoyed. "This bag's still half full. Why'd you press the button?"

Vincent opened his mouth, but Hannah cut in and pointed at him. "It wasn't me. He moved too suddenly earlier and reopened his wound.Can you take a look?"

Vincent blinked. So, Hannah had called the nurse for

him. If she cared that much, didn't that mean he still mattered to her? A small smile tugged at his lips.

The nurse walked over and lifted his shirt. "Tsk. This much bleeding-and you didn't feel it?"

Hannah looked over, frowning when she saw the gauze soaked through with blood.

The nurse chided gently, "Bet you wouldn't have kept toughing it out if your girlfriend were not around.Don't be so stubborn-your health comes first."

Vincent thoroughly enjoyed hearing the nurse referring to Hannah as "his girlfriend."

Hannah quickly corrected, "Ex-wife. I'm his ex-wife,not his girlfriend."

But before the last syllable had fully escaped her mouth, the door creaked open, and in walked a familiar figure.
###Chapter 172 Is She Really Gone For Good

The moment Felix stepped in, Hannah was reminded of his previous confession of feelings, and the air between them grew subtly tense.

Felix, however, remained composed and casual as he entered the room.

Vincent's smile vanished the instant he laid eyes on Felix. "What the hell are you doing here?"

"The same thing you are, Mr. Jones," Felix replied coolly. He had flown over as soon as he'd made contact with Vincent. Turning his attention to Hannah, concern softened his features. "Are you alright?"

"I'm fine. There's no need to worry," Hannah responded gently.

The nurse, caught off guard by the unexpected
appearance of a second man, froze for a beat.

Hannah turned to the nurse and pointed at Vincent."Please take him back to his ward and redress his wound."

Snapping out of it, the nurse quickly nodded. "T'll take care of it now."

"There's no need. It doesn't hurt," Vincent said coldly. He clearly had no intention of leaving Hannah alone with Felix.

Hannah's expression shifted. She instructed, "Ignore his words. Just take him for the dressing."

An uncomfortable silence settled in the room.

Eventually, Vincent stood up, unwilling to argue over something so minor. Hannah's insistence, after all,only proved she cared about his injury. "I'll go," he said, shooting Felix a glance before walking out with the nurse.

Now alone, Hannah and Felix stood quietly for a moment.

"You..."
They spoke at the same time and paused.

Felix let out a small laugh. "You go first."

Hannah didn't hesitate. "I wanted to ask-does your ,phone have any record of a message sent to me?Someone used your phone to lure me to the Mist Bar that day."

Only then did Felix knowv about it. He immediately retrieved his phone and handed it over. The message history was empty.

Hannah let out a humorless chuckle. "Whoever it was must've wiped it."

Felix shared what he'd discovered at the guesthouse."I went back and found that whoever checked you out had cleared out all your belongings. It was like you'd vanished without a trace."

Hannah brought up the key point. "My passport is missing." Clearly, someone didn't want her to return home.

She asked, "Did you find out who checked me out?"

"I asked the front desk, but the receptionist couldn't remember. Said there were too many guests. But l got hold of security footage-the person was careful."

He handed her the phone. In the video, the figure wore a hat and kept their head down, avoiding every camera.

But Hannah recognized the figure instantly. It was Brinley. She connected the dots-Brinley bumping into her on purpose before she left, luring her to Mist Bar, and Paige's so-called "training." It had all been a trap to keep her from going home.

Hannah's face turned to stone.


At the Jones estate, Brinley and Danica sat comfortably, sipping coffee and nibbling on pastries.
Danica leaned in, eyes gleaming with curiosity. "You said Hannah's not coming back-what do you mean?Is she really gone for good?"

A smug smile played on Brinley's lips. "Of course.I've got a friend overseas who knows how to make someone disappear permanently."

Brinley had crossed paths with Paige by chance and kept her business card after learning she specialized in sourcing beautiful women for powerful local figures.

The thought of Hannah becoming someone's plaything thrilled Brinley to no end.

Just then, Brinley's phone rang. Seeing Paige's name, she assumed it was a call of gratitude now that the job was done. She stepped aside to answer,a hint of glee in her voice."Hey."

But Paige's tone was far from thankful. "Mist Bar got raided. Since you seem so interested in our work,why not invest and partner up? That rich guy you're cozy with should have money to burn..." Brinley's stomach dropped. She didn't want to hear another word. "What about the woman I handed over?"

"Oh, her? She escaped. Screwed up everything."

Brinley ended the call abruptly. "Useless trash," she muttered through clenched teeth.

Unbeknownst to her, just behind a nearby column, an elderly figure had overheard everything. With a stunned expression, the elderly figure turned quietly and walked away.
###Chapter 173 Flew Back With Her


Inside Hannah's hospital room, Felix cycled through every topic he could think of, but soon he ran out of words and gave a reluctant sigh as he rose to his feet. "Now that I know you're all right, I can finally breathe easy. I told your parents you were with some friends here and decided to extend your trip, so make sure you stick to that story."

A grateful smile flickered across Hannah's lips. "I got it.Thank you."

The IV beeped to signal it was finished. Hannah pressed the call button, and a nurse appeared to remove the needle.

Hannah swept aside the blanket and started to swing her legs out of bed, but Felix quickly stopped her."Don't bother walking me out. I'll get back on my own-I am staying at that same guesthouse."

"I was heading out anyway. I have to get my passport
reissued if I want to go home," she replied, bracing herself to stand.

Felix's brow creased with worry. "Seriously, there's no need to rush. Just focus on getting your strength back."

"I'm not waiting around," Hannah responded, her voice steely with resolve. Just thinking about Brinley's actions sent a surge of restlessness and mounting fury through her veins.

Felix hesitated and then ran a hand over the back of his neck. "Then I'll go with you. After everything you've just been through, there's no way I'm letting you go off alone. Not as your friend."

He put extra weight on the last word, hoping she wouldn't shut him out.

She hadn't planned to drag him into her mess, but his persistence left her no room to argue. With a reluctant smile, she agreed."Alright." Meanwhile, in Vincent's hospital room, the nurse quietly changed his dressing while he drifted out of consciousness,woozy from the blood loss.

When he finally came to, night had already fallen,shadows stretching across the floor.

Vincent wasted no time, heading straight to Hannah's ward to check if she'd eaten. But when he opened the door, he froze-a stranger lay in the bed,and Hannah was nowhere in sight.

Vincent's eyes hardened, the coldness in his stare sending a chill down the corridor. He stopped a passing nurse. "What happened to the patient who was on that bed? Did she switch rooms?"

The nurse paused and then snapped her fingers in recognition. "Oh, you mean the young lady? She checked out. She barely finished her IV before she dashed off. Young people these days don't know how to rest."

Vincent's jaw tensed as her words sank in. Without saying a word, he turned and walked away. That
heartless Hannah, slipping away from the hospital without a word to him. A bitter frustration smoldered in his chest, leaving him with nowhere to direct his angér.

Just then, Andres arrived, arms weighed down with a basket of glossy fruit. He took one look at Vincent's stormy face and tried for small talk before turning to leave.

Vincent stopped him with a clipped command. "Get the discharge papers ready. I'm done here and going home."

Andres kept his tone low and measured. "I'll arrange a private jet right away."

Vincent shot Andres a look, his voice glacial. "Don't bother. I want you to find out which flight Hannah's on. I'll be on it,too."

Andres nodded and got to work, keeping all questions to himself.

That evening, after an exhausting sprint through
embassy red tape, Hannah finally had her replacement passport in hand. She and Felix managed to book seats on the flight home.

First class filled slowly with weary travelers.

Hannah burrowed under her blanket, eager to shut out the world. Just as her eyelids fluttered closed,she felt a shadow fall over her. She looked up-and Vincent stood at her side, his face drawn and cold.

Vincent regarded her with a stony face. "Didn't waste any time making your departure, did you?"

Felix turned and shot Vincent a sidelong look.

Hannah sat up a little straighter. "Why are you on this flight?" she demanded.

Vincent spoke with a detached, almost mechanical tone. "I'm heading home."

What Hannah really wanted to say was, "You're still hurt. Why didn't you just take your own jet? Why put yourself through a commercial flight with us?" But she swallowed the questions-there was no point
arguing when Vincent hnad clearly made up his mind.

Vincent's brow furrowed as he posed a question."Why didn't you let me know you were leaving the hospital?"

"I just forgot," Hannah murmured, her eyes drifting away, unwilling to get into it here.

The way she shut him out made Vincent's chest tighten. His wound throbbed, a dull ache blooming sharper as he stared at her. His voice dropped,edged with frustration. "Even after our divorce,we can still be friends. Are you really so bitter that you'd sneak out of the hospital without saying a word,especially after I risked my life for you?"

Hannah arched an eyebrow, a hint of challenge in her gaze. "You're absolutely right. I am that bitter.I don't play at being friends with my ex-husband." She paused, her tone sharpening. "And let's get one thing straight-I never asked you to take that knife for me."

Vincent hissed under his breath, "You ungrateful little thing." She obviously cared. She just couldn't bring
herself to admit it. And yet she'd slipped away from the hospital without a word, leaving him smoldering with frustration.

Vincent's hand hovered protectively over his abdomen, pain creasing his features. Hannah noticed, her eyes narrowing. "You really followed us all the way out here just to talk about this?" Instead of resting like he was supposed to, he was here-forcing himself through the pain just to argue. What was he thinking?

Vincent shrugged off her question, muttering, "No.The scent of disinfectant dlidn't sit right with me.l didn't want to stay."

He lowered himnself gingerly into the seat beside her,a faint groan escaping through gritted teeth. Turning to her with a crooked half-smile, he murmured, "lf staying friends is off the table, we could always just go back to being married, you know?"

Hannah rolled her eyes and yanked the blanket up her head, shutting him out completely. With his gentle attentiveness, Felix leaned in and asked if she wanted to take his seat. Hannah shook her head, politely refusing.

After an endless flight-nearly eleven hours-the plane finally touched down. Hannah and Felix made their way out together.

Vincent suddenly seized Hannah by the arm. Before she could snap at him, his face went stiff with alarm."My grandma was hospitalized again."
###Chapter 174 The Person In The Video Is Brinley
Vincent winced as the pain in his wound flared during the trip, leaving him restless through the night. By the time he landed, he looked drained, and then came Aubrey's message: Sharon had been hospitalized.

Hannah, setting aside her frustration with Vincent,followed him straight to the hospital.

When they arrived at the private suite, Hannah spotted Sharon calmly eating breakfast, and only then did the weight in her chest ease.

Hannah walked over and took a seat beside her."Sharon, you really gave me a scare. Is your blood pressure under control now?"

Vincent stood nearby, his voice low and concerned."What happened? What caused the sudden spike? You fainted."

He had already spoken to Aubrey on his way, trying to piece together what had led to Sharon's abrupt collapse.

"Don't worry about me," Sharon replied, gently taking Hannah's hand and giving her a once-over."It's just you... I'm so relieved you made it back safely. The Jones family is at fault for what you've been through." Her voice trembled, laced with emotion.

Hannah's eyes widened slightly, realizing that Sharon's hospitalization was connected to what had happened to her. And there was only one likely source: Brinley.

Hannah's hands clenched in her lap as anger surged through her.

Vincent's expression darkened. He sat beside Sharon, lightly patting her back. "Who told you about Hannah's incident?" Before Sharon could answer, Hannah cut in."Who else do you think?"

At that moment, Brinley and Danica entered the room, carrying a basket of fruit. Their faces lit up when they saw Vincent-until they noticed Hannah.The sight of her instantly soured both their moods.

.Brinley managed to keep her expression neutral, but the thought that Vincent and Hannah might have returned together intensified her resentment toward Hannah. Trying to mask her irritation, she casually asked, "Vincent, why are you with Hannah?"

Hannah didn't miss a beat. "Why not ask me directly?" she shot back, her tone sharp as she gently patted Sharon's hand, unconcerned with the fallout.

Sharon gave Hannah a slight nod, silently encouraging her.

Hannah rose to her feet and slapped Brinley across the face. "Surprised to see me back?" Brinley held her cheek, stunned. "I don't understand what you mean."

Danica jumped up. in outrage. "Hannah, are you 、insane? Why did you hit Brinley like that?" She turned to Vincent, screeching, "Throw this lunatic out!"

But Vincent didn't budge.

Hannah stared Brinley down. "You destroyed my passport, tossed my luggage, and led me straight into that nightmare of a bar. You planned for me not to return, didn't you?"

Vincent's eyes turned razor-sharp as he turned to Brinley."Was it you?"

Brinley had never seen Vincent look at her that way before. Forcing herself to stay calm, she said,"Vincent, how could I do something like that? You know I came back with you-you of all people should understand!"

Brinley told herself that she couldn't afford to panic.Hannah didn't have hard evidence. Hannah wasn't done. Her expression cold, she pulled out her phone and played the video Felix had sent."How do you explain dragging my suitcase out of the guesthouse?"

Brinley glanced at the footage. "That person's bundled up. That could be anyone."

"If it wasn't you, then maybe it was Daphne. Should call her right now and ask?" Hannah retorted coldly,flipping through her contacts.

Brinley stiffened, her fingers tightening. Daphne was the last person she wanted involved. She had worked hard to build that relationship.

Vincent spoke before Hannah could make the call.His voice was quiet but firm. "No need. The person in the video is Brinley."

He knew Daphne didn't have that slim build. He stared at Brinley, disappointment washing over his features. "Why? Why would you do this? Do you realize you nearly got Hannah killed?" "| didn't... | swear, I didn't," Brinley stammered,clinging to his arm. "Vincent, she's lying. How could you just take her word for it?"

"Enough!" Sharon's voice cut sharply through the room. "Hannah is not lying. You put her through the nightmare."
###Chapter 175 Severing All Ties


Heads swiveled toward Sharon the instant she opened her mouth.

Brinley seethed, unable to fathom why Sharon, that meddlesome hag, insisted on inserting herself into every matter. Utterly insufferable.

With a teary, wounded look, Brinley said, "Sharon,just because you're fond of Hannah doesn't mean you can go around saying things like that."

Unmoved, Sharon handed her phone straight to Hannah."Play it."

Hannah, tamping down the flare of fury in her chest,tapped the video open. The recording was unsteady,but every word rang out crisp and unmistakable.

It turned out, on the day in question, that Sharon had gone for a stroll and happened to overhear Brinley and Danica whispering.Catching fragments aboutHannah, she'd hit record without a second thought.

Now, inside the vast hospital room, Danica's and Brinley's voices echoed from the speakers.

Danica had said, "You just said Hannah isn't coming back-what's that supposed to mean? Is she really gone forever?"

Brinley had replied, "Obviously. I've got a friend overseas who can make sure Hannah never returns again." The record ended.

Danica's voice trembled as she rushed out her defense. "This has nothing to do with me! Brinley's the one behind all of it-I wasn't involved."

Vincent shut his eyes, his disappointment plain and unguarded.

Hannah's stare could have sliced through steel as she turned to Brinley. "I always thought it was odd,the way Paige was waiting for me that day. So I was right-you two were in this together. Care to explain yourself now?"With Vincent's cold gaze fixed on her, Brinley clung desperately to denial. "I don't know any Paige. I've never even heard of 'Mist Bar.'"

.Vincent's patience snapped. "That's enough. Just stop lying. Hannah never mentioned 'Mist Bar' to anyone.So,how do you know that name?"

Brinley's composure crumbled, panic flashing acrosS her face. "Vincent-please, just let me explain..."

Brinley reached out to grab his sleeve, but Vincent pulled away, shaking her off. She stumbled, left clutching at empty air.

Vincent's eyes stayed fixed on her, his face cold and unreadable. "What is there to explain? That you nearly got Hannah killed?" His tone was sharp and piercing. "I don't even know who you are anymore."

Brinley broke down, collapsing onto the polished floor as tears spilled unchecked down her cheeks."Vincent, I did everything for you! I just love you too much. Even after your divorce, Hannah wouldn't let you go. I just thought... I figured that if she disappeared, maybe you'd finally notice me. -I wasn't thinking straight..." Her words dissolved into desperate sobs. "Please, Vincent, just this once-just forgive me. I'll never do anything like this again, I swear."

She grabbed at his hand in a frantic plea, but Vincent wrenched free, turning away, jaw clenched, refusing to give her a single glance.

Hannah's voice cut through the tension, icy and unwavering. "Brinley, you don't owe Vincent an apology. The person you hurt is me. And even if you begged, I'd never forgive you."

Sharon's tone left no room for argument. "I want Brinley gone from the Jones estate this instant. From now on, she's cut off from us completely."

Brinley's breath hitched, her sobs trembling in the silence. "Vincent, please... You can't just cast me out. This is all I have-this family is everything."

Danica's voice quavered, unable to hold back. "Isn't this going too far? How could you do this to Brinley?" "Too far?" Hannah's bitter laugh sliced through the tension. "Wasn't it cruel when she set me up like that?"

、Danica shrank back, at a loss for words.

Desperate, Brinley's eyes scoured Vincent's face,hunting for the slightest hint of hesitation. Buthis expression was cold and unyielding-utterly merciless.

Vincent agreed with Sharon's decision. "We'll do as my grandma says." He turned to Brinley, his gaze icy."For years, I've put up with your antics. I never thought you'd actually try to take a life. From now on,the Jones family severs all ties with you."

Brinley crumpled on the floor, her face drained of all color, looking as though her entire world had just collapsed.

Hannah crouched beside Brinley, her voice low and taunting. "Must sting, doesn't it? After everything you did, I'm still the one left standing." "You!" Brinley, shaking with rage, swung her hand at Hannah's cheek, but Hannah snatched her wrist with ease.

"Slapping, huh? Don't make me laugh. I've got way more experience than you!" Hannah snapped back,twisting Brinley's arm and landing two sharp slaps across her face. "Consider that payback."
###Chapter 176 Face The Consequences Of Her Actions
Two sharp blows landed across Brinley's face. Tears streamed down in an unstoppable flood as she turned toward Vincent, desperate for any sign that he might come to her rescue.

Vincent kept his gaze elsewhere. He didn't so much as blink in her direction.

For Brinley, every mistake, every risk she had taken,had always been for Vincent, so how could he turn his back on her now? A deep sense of despair clouded her vision as she looked at him.

Standing tall and cold, Hannah fixed her eyes on Brinley. There was not a hint of kindness in her stare."Did you really think it would end like this?"

Brinley raised her head to meet the challenge, unable to hide the bitter anger twisting her face.  going to make sure you answer for what you've done. The evidence against you is overwhelming,and you'll likely spend the rest of your life in prison,"Hannah declared, her tone as frigid as her expression. "Now, let's see who is still willing to shield you."

As she spoke those final words, her gaze flicked .toward Vincent-completely devoid of emotion.

Vincent said nothing, but his silence made it clear where he stood.

With panic taking over, Brinley collapsed onto her knees before Vincent. Her voice shook as she begged, "Vincent, please, I can't go to jail. I'm too young.I promise I'll change. Just help me this one time. Please, Vincent, I'm begging you."

Vincent shook her hand off his sleeve and answered in a tone that was steady and low, "You're an adult.You need to face the consequences of your actions."After thinking it over for a few moments, he relented just a little. "I'll get a lawyer to defend you. That's all l can do." Brinley broke down completely. "Vincent..." Her v/oice was a hollow echo of defeat.

Inside the hospital room, Brinley's sobs drowned out everything else. Hannah, growing irritated by the noise disturbing Sharon's peace, reached for the phone and spoke to security. "Someone's causing a disturbance here, affecting the patient's rest. Could you send someone over?"

Caught in her sorrow, Brinley didn't even react until two security guards moved to escort her away.

"On what grounds are you kicking me out? Let go!"Brinley fought against their grip, but her protest faded as she was led down the hall, leaving the room finally quiet.

Danica, slumped on the couch, looked pale and worn. Not long after, she muttered an excuse and slipped out.

Vincent, lost in thought, soon followed, mumbling a reason as he left.Left alone, Sharon squeezed Hannah's hand, her thoughts tangled. "Hannah, when I overheard Brinley's exchange with Danica, I was worried about you.Seeing you safe makes me feel like I'm halfway to recovery."

Seeing Sharon so frail tugged at Hannah's heart. She sat close and spoke softly. "Sorry for making you ·worry."

"What matters most is that you're safe now."Hesitation crept in before Sharon added, "Hannah,please don't hold it against Vincent. He has his reasons for letting Brinley off so easily."

Choosing not to linger on the topic, Hannah offered a gentle promise instead. "Don't worry about it now.I'll stay by your side until you drift off."

A smile of gratitude appeared as Sharon replied,"Thank you. That would help."

Sharon knew she couldn't get involved in the tangled history between Hannah and Vincent, so she let the subject drop. Fatigue weighed on Sharon, and before long, she slipped into a peaceful sleep.

Moving as quietly as she could, Hannah left the hospital room, only to nearly bump into Vincent waiting in the hallway. She leveled a steady look at him and spoke in a calm but firm tone. "Let Sharon rest. Give her some time before you go back in."

"Alright," Vincent said, his words rough, as though he hadn't spoken for a while. "I was waiting for you."

"I need to go back," Hannah said, her refusal clear.

"I promise this won't take long," Vincent answered,his eyes not leaving her.

Refusing to entertain him further, Hannah walked away. Vincent dropped his gaze for a moment, but then he hurried after her, gripping her arm and steering her toward a quiet corner.

Hannah pulled free from his hold and challenged him directly. "What is it that you need?"

Getting straight to the issue, Vincent said,  "I didn't  know what Brinley had done until now. I'm here to apologize for everything she put you through."

"No apology can undo what she's done. She'll answer for her mistakes, and if you're hoping I'll show her mercy, that's not happening," Hannah said,her stare as cold as her words.

Vincent's tone shifted to one of gravity as he held her gaze. "You've got it wrong. There's something l need you to understand about all this."
###Chapter 177 You're Not Worthy Of Another Opportunity
Hannah shot Vincent an impatient look, clearly unable to grasp what he was trying to say.

Vincent had wrestled with himself for a long time. He had stayed silent about everything between him and Brinley, believing it was something he could manage alone. But now, Brinley had gone so far as to hurt Hannah-and that, he realized, was a direct result of his silence and past indulgence. That made him just as much to blame.

His mind wandered, slipping into an old memory."Brinley, her brother, and I grew up together," he began slowly. "When I was seven, I dragged her brother to come with me to the beach. The waves were too strong. We got swept away. Her father came running-he saved me first. But when he went back for his son... Neither of them came back." He  paused, his voice tightening. "Brinley was only five.Ever since then, I've given her everything she wanted. The way she turned out... That's on me."

He blamed himself for failing to guide Brinley as he should have.

Hannah's eyes flickered with surprise, but the emotion vanished almost instantly. "You're telling me this now so that I'll feel bad for you?" she asked,her tone flat. "So I'Il understand how hard life has been for you?"

Vincent's face darkened. "Of course not. I'm telling you because I owe you a real apology, and to make it clear that I only view Brinley as a little sister. Nothing more."

"You don't need to apologize," Hannah replied coolly."You made your choices. Now you live with the consequences. And whether Brinley's like your sister or someone you failed to guide properly-it's got nothing to do with me."

Vincent frowned, urgency creeping into his voice. How can it have nothing to do with you? You used to mind her so much. You always thought something was going on between her and me. I'm telling you now-there wasn't. There never was."

Hannah let out a low chuckle. But just as quickly, the smile disappeared. She looked at him coldly."How many times did I ask you about her? Hundreds, at least. And each time, you said nothing. But after we divorced; now you come to explain yourself? Don't you think that's ridiculous?"

"There's still time to make things right," Vincent said,stepping closer.

"No, there isn't," Hannah replied icily, her voice distant. "I don't care about your little history with Brinley."

Vincent's brows pulled together. "You don't believe me? Or do you still think there was something between me and Brinley? If you don't believe me,ask my grandmother."

"I'm just your ex-wife," Hannah said, her voice void of emotion. "Does it really matter what I believe?"

"It matters." Vincent stared at her. After a pause, he added, "Because I regret everything. I don't want to be your ex-husband. I want another chance. I want us to try again."

That was why Vincent had poured everything out-he believed that explaining his past with Brinley could erase the misunderstandings and start over. But Hannah's reaction clearly disappointed him.

Suddenly, it clicked for Hannah. So this was what it was all about. He thought that unravelling the mess with Brinley could undo the damage. That it could fix them."You think that just because you cleared things up with Brinley, I'll say yes to marrying you again?"she asked sharply.

Vincent's face remained serious. "Isn't that the point? You used to mind her so much."

"Vincent, don't be so naive." Hannah's frustration grew. "Brinley was just the trigger. Even if there was nothing between you and her, the real issue is that  you let her hurt me. And now, what-those things don't count because you've 'explained' them?"

"I'll make it up to you," Vincent said, his voice sincere.

Hannah's lips twitched downward. "You'll make it up to me again? For the nights I cried, the pain I endured because of you-do you really think you can make up for that?"

Vincent said nothing.

Hannah didn't let up. Her tone was cutting. "What makes you think I'd pretend none of it ever happened and just take you back?"

"You still love me, don't you?" Vincent's voice quickened, desperation creeping in. "Back when we were abroad, you were so worried about me...Doesn't that mean you still care?"

Hannah met his gaze, calm and unwavering. "Even if it hadn't been you-if a total stranger had died trying to save me-I still would've cried. You're not special.I stopped caring about you a long time ago."

Something flickered in her eyes. She took a step forward, studying him. "Let me ask you something...That stab wound you took for me-did it hurt?"

Vincent hesitated and then gave a small nod.

Hannah reached out and pressed against,his abdomen through his shirt."Was it here?"

Vincent caught her hand and guided it lower, holding her gaze. "Here. Right here."

He was sure of it-she still cared.

But then, without warning, Hannah pressed hard on the spot.

"Ah-" Vincent gasped, his face contorting in pain.His eyes searched hers, confused and stunned.

Hannah lowered her gaze. Her voice came quiet,emotionless. "Hurts, doesn't it?"

She looked up, meeting his eyes. "But that pain? It doesn't even come close to one-tenth of what you've put me through. I was broken because of you. Why would I ever go back to you? Recall this pain. And don't even dare mention "remarriage" in such a casual manner. You're not worthy of another opportunity."

With that, Hannah stepped around him and walked away without a backward glance.

Vincent left behind, defeated.
###Chapter 178 Brinley's Suicidal Attempt
Brinley went back to the Jones family home by herself. She sat motionless at the dressing table, her expression hollow, eyes void of life. Vincent didn't believe her anymore-not even a little.

She couldn't just sit by and let everything collapse.
She couldn't go to jail. Her eyes drifted downward to a razor blade lying on the table.

With trembling fingers, Brinley picked it up and gently dragged it across her wrist. The pressure was faint, barely nicking the skin.

It wasn't enough-not nearly enough. If she wanted Vincent to pity her, she needed to bleed.

Clenching her jaw, she pressed down harder, carving a deeper cut into her wrist.

The blade bit into her flesh, sending a sharp jolt of pain through her arm as blood began to trickle down,staining her wrist before dripping to the floor.

She grabbed her phone, took a photo of the wound,and sent it to Vincent. "Vincent, I really messed up.lf my death can make things right, then I'm willing. My only regret is letting you down."

Afterward, she messaged Danica as well, thanking her for everything, and attached the same photo.

To make sure nothing went wrong, Brinley set a timer to alert emergency services. Hannah didn't die, so she couldn't die either.

In the mirror, her gaze turned cold-steeled with resolve.

Hearing footsteps echoing upstairs, she quickly collapsed beside the bed, letting her body go limp,feigning unconsciousness.

Danica had just arrived home when the message came through. Heart pounding, she raced upstairs,calling Brinley's name again and again. But Brinley didn't move. Panic surged through Danica's voice as she ordered the house staff to call an ambulance.

***

At the hospital, Vincent stood in the hallway,motionless, his thoughts in disarray. Hannah had rejected him twice. With Brinley and Felix no longer obstacles to their remarriage, Hannah still persistently refused him. Fine. So be it. It wasn't the end of the world.

He was the CEO of Jones Group. Surely, he could find a woman more suitable than Hannah. Other women could also win his grandmother's approval.

But still, why did it feel so hard to breathe? What exactly was he so upset about?

Later, he returned to Sharon's hospital room.She had just woken up.

Seeing how pale he looked, Sharon frowned in concern. "You look awful. Are you not feeling well?"

"I asked Hannah to remarry me," Vincent said quietly, voice dull.

Sharon's eyes lit up. "That's wonderful news."

Vincent sank into the sofa, gaze downcast. "She turned me down.Twice."

Sharon didn't look surprised. She had expected it.

"Grandma... Was I really that terrible to her?" Vincent asked,his voice distant.

Sharon met his eyes with a steady look. "It's not about that, Vincent. But you neglected her. You failed her as a husband. After she married you,her smile had faded little by little."

Vincent fell silent, the weight of her words sinking in.

Sharon added gently, "If you're serious about winning her back, don't just say it. Show her. Do the things people do when they're courting-bring her flowers, ask her out to a movie, take an interest in what matters to her. Woo her."

Vincent furrowed his brows, deep in thought. "Forgetit. She's already made up her mind. I won't force her."It almost sounded like he was trying to convince himself.

"You're just being stubborn," Sharon sighed, shaking her head.

Vincent instinctively picked up his phone to check his messages. The moment Brinley's photo appeared on the screen, his expression shifted. But then, he saw Danica's message and exhaled in relief.

His grip on the phone tightened. He suddenly stood up. "Grandma, if you need anything, let Aubrey know.I need to head back to the office."

He felt there was no reason to tell Sharon about Brinley's suicidal attempt.

Sharon waved him off. "Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Go do what you need to."

Vincent left the room and made his way to the ICU, a heavy regret settling over him. He shouldn't have spoken so harshly to Brinley earlier. If anything happened to Brinley now, how could he live with that,especially after her father and brother had passed away partly because of him?

The same paralyzing dread that had gripped him as a child-the one he felt at seven years old-rose in his chest again,suffocating and cold.
###Chapter 179 Who Sent The Roses


After a long while, Brinley was finally wheeled out of the emergency room.

Once Brinley was settled into her hospital room, she soon regained consciousness. Upon seeing Vincent nearby, she reached out and clutched his sleeve."Vincent, I have something to tell you."

Vincent gently pried off her grip and said in a soft,low voice, "You should rest. I'll go ask the doctor about your condition."

With that, he turned and left the room. After confirming with the doctor that Brnley was no longer in danger, he exhaled in quiet relief.

In the past, at moments like this, he would have stayed by Brinley's side, driven by self-reproach. But now... He didn't return to her room. Instead, he went straight back to the office. Having his mother there was enough. Back in the hospital room, Brinley lay still, her face pale, her eyes fixed longingly on the door.

Danica noticed the look in her eyes and gently suggested, "Brinley, try to rest. Vincent has already gone back to the office."

"He's still angry with me," Brinley murmured, her gaze dropping to the edge of her blanket.

Danica offered a warm, reassuring smile. "Don't think like that. Vincent is still very worried about you. He was pacing back and forth outside the emergency room earlier."

"Really?" Brinley's eyes lit up with a flicker of hope.

"Of course. Vincent only spoke that way out of frustration. Once he cools down, he'll be concerned for you again," Danica said, confident in her son's nature. After all, Vincent had been taking care of Brinley since he was just seven. There was no way he didn't care.
 
Danica added, "But you must never try to commit suicide again. You can't play around with your life, no matter how upset you feel."

"I was just scared Vincent would end up hating me..."Brinley whispered. "I won't do it again."



At Nova Tech, Hannah returned and immediately sifted through the information the staff had compiled on Evan. They had secured clear photos of Evan interacting with Brinley-concrete evidence that he had breached the company's confidentiality agreement.

Felix, upon seeing the materials, looked grim. "What are you planning to do?"

"Since Brinley went to such lengths, she deserves a fitting payback," Hannah said, carefully storing the files. "Now, we need to push the release of the wristband 4.0-before anyone has the chance to accuse us of stealing their work."

She planted her hands firmly on the table. "Have the representatives from VitraMind come here?"

Felix gave a slight nod. "Yes, they've arrived."

"The Al integration is critical. I'll oversee it myself."

"Alright." Felix paused and then asked cautiously,"What about the overseas issue? How do you plan to handle that?"

"I'm collecting proof to hold Brinley accountable,"Hannah replied with a faint, unreadable smile.

Felix watched her intently and then said with quiet sincerity, "If you need anything, just say the word.I've got your back."

"Thank you," Hannah responded, her tone softer now.

The tension from their last meeting had faded,replaced by a sense of camaraderie. Working closely together had melted away the awkwardness that once stood between them.

Hannah spent the entire day collaborating with VitraMind's technical team, working tirelessly to advance the Al features in the new watch. Near the end of the day, she was unexpectedly handed a large bouquet of red roses-no card, no name.

The team at Nova Tech instantly began teasing her about a secret admirer, but Hannah only laughed it off.

Thinking it might be Felix, she joked, "Did you send me flowers as a reward for working so efficiently?Thanks, I'll take that as a compliment."

She tried to brush it off with humor, but Felix simply replied, "I didn't send those."

An awkward silence followed.

Realizing Felix wasn't the sender, Hannah's thoughts turned to Vincent. Could this be his way of trying to win her back? Determined to avoid another misunderstanding like last time, she removed Vincent from her block list and sent him a photo of the bouquet. Vincent was in the middle of a meeting when he saw Hannah's message. His expression darkened instantly.

Unable to restrain himself, he typed. "Is Felix pursuing you? Red roses? How unimaginative."

Then, he wrote again. "Are you trying to show off?"

A thought struck him, and he tapped his screen. "Or are you dropping a hint of wanting me to send you flowers?"

He gripped his phone tightly, sending only three messages-barely holding back more. His eyes flicked to the screen every few seconds.

Five minutes passed. No reply. He couldn't resist and sent one more message. "Why aren't you replying?"

But this one failed to deliver. Hannah had blocked him again. Vincent's jaw tightened, his face shadowed with frustration.

Meanwhile, Hannah, reading over Vincent's messages, realized one thing clearly. He hadn't sent the roses either. Then who did?
###Chapter 180 Still Intent To Kick Her
Brinley had spent several days recovering in the hospital, but Vincent hadn't visited her once. She made sure to mention her hospital stay to Daphne.

Within the hour, Daphne showed up clutching a bag of fruits. "Brinley, are you alright?"

A slight paleness lingered on Brinley's face as she shared the news. "According to the doctor, I'm all clear now."

Brinley started to extend her left hand-wrapped in gauze-to gesture at the chair, but just as quickly,she tucked it back beneath the covers.

Daphne, eyes sharp, caught the movement right away. "Brinley, what happened to your hand?"

Brinley faltered, her eyes welling up before tears  spilled over. "I just... I didn't want to keep living." Daphne's entire demeanor shifted, her voice low and urgent."Tell me-what happened?"

"Hannah and Vincent may be divorced, but she's still hanging onto him. And now-" Brinley broke off,pressing trembling fingers to her eyes as fresh sobs shook her shoulders. "She even said she wants to marry him again. She wants me out of the Jones estate for good."

She wept harder, carefully watching for a reaction.Daphne's expression darkened with outrage as she believed Brinley's manipulative words without hesitation. "She didn't act like this when we were overseas.Why is she showing her true colors after returning? That woman is absolutely shameless."

After a pause, Daphne promised fiercely, "Don't cry,Brinley. I'll stand up for you!"

Brinley made a mock attempt to caution Daphne."Daphne, please-don't get yourself dragged into this because of me. Hannah's ruthless."

Daphne's chin lifted in stubborn defiance. "My brother's got my back. I'm not scared of her."

A sly, almost triumphant little smile crept across Brinley's lips.

Once Daphne left, quiet settled over the hospital room.

Later, Brinley heard from Danica that Vincent had been making regular trips to visit Sharon. Though her ward and Sharon's shared the hospital building,he hadn't appeared in front of her even once.

A restless anxiety churned in Brinley's chest. In the end, she caved and sent Vincent a message.

Not long after, Vincent finally appeared at her door.

The moment she spotted him, she pushed herself upright, hands trembling as she tried to sit up straight.

Vincent's gaze remained frosty as he stepped inside."Don't get up. I'm only here for a minute," he said, his voice clipped and distant.
Brinley forced a faint, apologetic smile, her words spilling out in a rush. "I'm truly sorry about what went down with Hannah. I promise it won't happen again.Can you forgive me?" She straightened her posture,trying to brush everything off.

Vincent offered no comfort. His voice was as measured as ever. "We only live once. You shouldn't ·throw yours away so recklessly."

He hesitated, the silence heavy between them,before adding, "Think about your father and your brother. They wouldn't want to see you like this."

Tears welled up in Brinley's eyes as she whispered, "I only acted that way because I thought you'd stopped caring about me. I wasn't thinking straight...I won't ever do it again." Her face remained ashen, but every word trembled with seemingly earnest regret.

Vincent stood silent for a long moment, his gaze unreadable, before finally saying, "You still can't stay at the Jones estate any longer."

Shock rippled across Brinley's face. The words landed like a blow, and tears slid down her cheeks in an unstoppable rush. Her voice broke, thick with despair. "Vincent, you're still going to kick me out?"

Vincent met her gaze with cool composure. "Didn't I already give you an apartment? From now on, that's where you'll stay. We're not actually siblings. It's not good for your reputation if you keep living in my family home. I should've thought that through sooner."

Brinley's sobs shook her thin frame. "Do you really have to make me leave?"

"If you don't want that apartment, I'll find you a different place," Vincent muttered, his voice steady,leaving no room for argument.

She wept quietly, searching his face for any hint of mercy. Seeing none, she tried a tentative plea."Could I stay at the Lakeshore Villa instead?"

"No." Vincent shut her down without a moment's pause. That villa had been his and Hannah's former home-there was no way he'd let anyone else live  there.

Vincent, clearly done with the conversation, gave a curt wave of dismissal. "If it's about where you stay,take it up with my mother."

He straightened his cuffs, a crisp snap of fabric punctuating his words, and then rose from the sofa with chilly efficiency. "Get some sleep. I've got work to do."

Brinley said nothing, her knuckles turning white as she clenched her fists beneath her blanket,refusing to let any emotion show.

Meanwhile, inside the gleaming offices of Nova Tech,Daphne swept in, trailed by her brother's tech consultant.

She wasted no time nitpicking, her every comment dripping with disdain as she picked apart minor flaws and watched the staff scramble in her wake.

With all the arrogance of a pampered heiress,Daphne c nearest manager. "Ms. Scott doesn't dare face me herself, so she sent you lot to brush me off?" She folded her arms with a scoff. "I'm not that easy to deal with."
###Chapter 181 You Really Know How To Reel Men In


At that moment, Hannah was sitting in her office. For several consecutive days, she had been receiving flowers-each bouquet different from the last. Curiously, not a single card bore a sender's name.

A subtle sense of unease began to take hold of her.

Suddenly, the hallway erupted in noise, and the next moment, someone stormed right into her office.
Daphne wasted no time making herself at home. "So this is how you treat your company's visitors, Hannah?Not even a proper greeting?" She perched herself on Hannah's desk, acting as if she owned the place.

Quickly sliding the bouquet of roses out of sight, Hannah offered her assistant at the door a silent nod.Catching on at once, the assistant slipped out and closed the door without a word.

No detail escaped Daphne's eye. Spotting the flowers stashed below, she slid off the desk, scooped them up with a smirk, and teased, "You really know how to reel men in, huh?"

Judgment colored her gaze, as if Hannah were the type of juggling admirers for sport.

Rather than getting worked up, Hannah steered the conversation back to business. "Why are you really here?"

Daphne's lips curled in a mischievous grin. "I came on behalf of my brother's firm. Someone has to check up on our star partner." Without warning, she sneezed onto the roses."Oh dear, hope I didn't ruin your bouquet. Totally accidental."

With a careless flick, she tossed the flowers aside, sending petals tumbling to the floor.

Unmoved, Hannah kept her voice steady."It's no trouble. I've been wondering what to do with those anyway, so thanks for the help." Turning to business, she continued, "If you're visiting on Mr. Whitaker's behalf, we'll have a team member show you around in just a bit."

Daphne didn't mask her intent to stir things up. "Forget anyone else. I want you to show me around today." Hannah reached for her laptop and checked the time on her watch. "Unfortunately, I have other pressing matters. There's no space in my schedule for this right now."

A thinly veiled threat followed. "Walk out on me and your company's getting a big, fat zero from me,"Daphne warned.

"That's your call. I won't stop you," Hannah replied, her calm unshaken. "But ask yourself-do you think Mr.Whitaker will cancel the collaboration merely due to a zero-point evaluation done out of personal spite?Knowing his standards, you might even end up getting scolded for not handling things professionally."

"You-" For a moment, Daphne seemed at a loss for words, her anger boiling over.

Stepping past Daphne, Hannah made for the door. Right then, Daphne threw out a bitter remark. "You look pretty pleased with yourself, don't you, Hannah?"

Direct as ever, Hannah replied, "Sealing a deal with VitraMind? I'd say I have every reason to be."

Daphne dismissed the answer with a scoff and closed the distance between them. "That's not what I meant.I'm talking about snatching up someone else's man-bet you're proud of that."

Hannah's demeanor never shifted. "Did you not listen to the last bidding session, or did you just choose to ignore it? Vincent stated, in front of everyone, that I'm his ex-wife. Not a mistress." For the sake of future business dealings, she made a point to spell it out.

A bitter scoff escaped Daphne, saying, "Spare me the speech. I already know what's really going on. You pushed Brinley into playing the other woman, and now you're divorced and still won't leave her man alone.Do you have any idea she tried to end her own life because of all this?" Agitation twisted her words tighter."You almost drove her to death!"

Hannah raised an eyebrow. Brinley attempted suicide? No one had ever told her this before. Ice crept into her features. "Were you there, Daphne? Did you see me force her to do anything? Did you see me put a blade in her hand? If she decided to hurt herself, how is that my fault?"

Outrage burned in Daphne's cheeks. "You're unbelievable! Someone nearly died because of you, and you act like you don't care!" Hannah replied calmly, "That's enough. If she refuses to value her own life, that isn't something I can fix.Why am I expected to carry the weight of her choices?" Her voice stayed steady, unwavering. "If you're so concerned for Brinley, shouldn't you be at her side instead of coming here just to pick a fight with me?"

Fuming, Daphne retorted, "You just wait! Cross me, and you cross my brother too. We'll see if your company can handle the consequences!"

Not so much as a flicker of concern crossed Hannah's face. "Childish," she responded simply.

Hannah walked straight out of the office, leaving Daphne stomping in frustration behind her.

Pausing in the hallway,Hannah checked her, phone for the date, piecing together her own silent countdown.The timing was just about right. Hearing about Brinley's suicide attempt only hardened her resolve.If Brinley thought this was rock bottom, then she had no idea what was still coming. The real chaos was set to hit in just a few days, and if she couldn't handle today, she would shatter under the pressure of what was next.

A string of days spent in the hospital brought Brinley no comfort. Eventually, she accepted that Vincent had no intention of visiting her. Back at Polaris Tech, she barely made it through the front door before being hit by a wave of setbacks and headaches waiting to be solved.
###Chapter 182 Lovely Little Gift She Prepared For Brinley


Several employees from the PR department came rushing in, and one of them reported, "Miss Gilbert, the plagiarism scandal we managed to suppress earlier has resurfaced. It's trending online now. What should we do?"

Brinley snapped, her voice sharp and furious, "And why are you asking me what to do? Bury it! I don't care what it takes or how much it costs-just get it off the internet!"

"Yes, Miss Gilbert," the PR staff replied stiffly, gritting their teeth.

Brinley pressed her fingers to her temple, her head throbbing with frustration.

Moments after the PR staff left Brinley's office, they returned. Without looking up, she barked,"Didn't you hear me the first time? Why are you back? Get that story taken down now! Go!"

But instead of answering her tirade, they tossed their ID badges onto her desk with a loud clatter. "We quit."Brinley slammed her palm against the table. "Useless! All of you-get out!"

As the disgruntled employees stormed out, an HR representative arrived, escorting two men dressed in crisp suits before waIking away himself. "We're from the Department of Commerce and Regulation,"one of two men stated. "Brinley Gilbert, correct? We've received allegations of business misconduct involving your company.We ask for your full cooperation in the investigation."

Brinley forced a tight smile. "That's absurd. There must be some kind of misunderstanding."

Just as she rose from her chair, the HR representative returned-this time with two uniformed officers."Brinley Gilbert?" one of them addressed her."We're with Interpol. You're under suspicion in connection with an international criminal case. Please come with us."

As the crowd swelled in Brinley's office, the HR representative quietly slipped out, joining his colleagues to gossip with thinly veiled curiosity.
Brinley stood frozen. For a moment, she couldn't decide which disaster to tackle first. "Just give me a moment," she said, struggling to maintain a polite tone as she stepped into the adjacent meeting room.

Inside, she quickly dialed Vincent Jones's number, her fingers trembling. NJo answer.

Right then, her phone buzzed with an incoming call. It was Danica. Brinley answered immediately."Mrs.Jones,is Vincent home?"

"He's not," Danica replied briskly. "I actually called to let you know-your belongings have been packed and delivered to the apartment near your office. Sharon made the arrangements. Starting today, you're not allowed back at the Jones estate."

Got it." Brinley's expression darkened as she ended the call. Sharon had made sure to strip her of every shred of dignity.

Without pause, Brinley dialed Hannah's number, her voice seething. "Was this your doing?"

"So what if it was?" Hannah answered coolly, her tone calm as she idly scrolled through Polaris Tech's market valuation charts. "The plagiarism exposé, the Department of Commerce and Regulation, Interpol-all part of the lovely little gift I prepared for you. So? What do you think-did you like it?"

She gave a soft, almost amused chuckle."Oh, and I reminded Sharon to help pack up your things.Thoughtful of me, don't you think?"

"You're trying to destroy me?" Brinley growled through clenched teeth.

"Destroy you?" Hannah scoffed. "You've got it allwrong. You were the one who nearly destroyed me. I'm just returning the favor-legally. Compared to you, I'm being kind. I only want you to serve time."

She leaned back in her chair, completely unbothered. "I hear prison for international criminals has a special kind of charm."

Brinley's fists clenched tightly at her sides. "Hannah, I swear, I will never let you get away with this!"

Hannah's laugh was cold and cutting. "Before you start making threats, maybe take a good look around.Your company's value is plummeting. Brinley-this time, you're finished."
With a scream of frustration, Brinley hurled her phone to the floor. She then kicked the table and chairs,sending them crashing violently against the walls, but the fury boiling in her chest refused to subside.She hadn't even become Vincent's wife yet-how could everything be falling apart already?

Meanwhile, after work, Vincent sat in the back of his car, heading toward Nova Tech.

Online, the scandal surrounding Brinley had exploded into a firestorm. Derek, glancing at the trending headlines, couldn't hold back. "Mr. Jones, are you really not going to step in about Miss Gilbert? Aren't you worried she might do something drastic again?"

Vincent's expression darkened.

Noticing his reaction, Derek quickly shifted gears. "May I ask why we're visiting Mrs. Jones today?"

Vincent shot him a cold look. "Do you always talk this much while driving?"

"No. Not at all," Derek replied instantly, clamming up.

Vincent turned the wedding ring on his finger slowly, lost in thought. Even he couldn't fully explain why he was headed to Nova Tech. He had already decided to let go and had forced himself not to look back, not to care. But in the stillness of the night, his thoughts always drifted back to Hannah. Even the sleeping pills prescribed by the doctor couldn't silence her name in his mind.

Perhaps it was those roses. They'd been haunting him for days. And now, he was desperate to know-Was someone else chasing after her?
###Chapter 183 Power Outage


Justice had finally caught up with Brinley, which left Hannah feeling lighter than she had in weeks. Things at the office seemed to be falling into place as well.

Spotting Hannah's upbeat mood, Felix decided to mark the occasion with a bouquet of cheerful yellow roses.

Finding another arrangement of flowers waiting on her desk, Hannah felt her smile waver when she noticed,once again, there was no name on the card. Could the sender have switched their preference to yellow this time? The ongoing mystery over who kept sending her anonymous bouquets continued to unsettle her.

Felix found her deep in thought, gazing at the flowers. He couldn't resist a playful jab. "You look troubled.Have yellow roses gone out of style for you?"

Surprise flickered across Hannah's face. "These are from you?"

Confirmation came with a nod. "I saw Evan's public statement online, just like we planned. Polaris Tech is backed into a corner now. That felt worth celebrating, so I brought flowers."

Relief softened Hannah's features. "Thanks, Felix. I'm glad these are yours."
For days, she had been getting red roses every evening, each bouquet as mysterious as the last. Now that the delivery had stopped, maybe the unwanted game was finally over. She allowed hersel to relax a bit.

"Work's wrapped up. Would you like to get dinner together?" Felix asked, trying to sound casual.

Things between them had been tense after he confessed his feelings, but their routine at work slowly helped them slip back into an easy familiarity.

Taking his time, Felix knew Hannah was fresh out of a broken marriage. Patience came easily to him-he could wait as long as she needed.

She turned him down with a gentle shake of her head. "I've got to stay behind and work on the program a bit more. It'll be a while. How about a rain check?"

He tried again, suggesting, "Want some company while you work?"

A quick answer followed. "No need. I'll just be running tests. It shouldn't take long."

Felix let it go at that. "Alright. Just let me know when you're home safe."

"I will," she replied.

Gradually, Nova Tech emptied as employees clocked out for the evening, until only Hannah remained in the quiet office.

Meanwhile, inside a Bentley stationed near the building, Derek glanced at the dashboard clock, realizing it was nearly eleven. He let out a tired yawn and asked, "Mr. Jones, is it that you don't know which floor Nova Tech is on?"

"Nineteenth floor, Building Nine, Cerulean Bay," Vincent answered right away.

Learning about Hannah and Felixlaunching Nova Tech together had prompted Vincent to memorize every detail about the company.

Given how long they'd been waiting, Derek spoke up. "If you're that familiar, why are we still out here? Why not go up and see her?"

They had watched employee after employee leave, yet Hannah was nowhere in sight.

Seeing her car parked close by, Vincent figured Hannah must still be working late. He waited a moment before replying, "What reason do I have to go up?"

Their offices both occupied buildings in the Cerulean Bay district-if she happened to spot him on the street, he could pass it off as pure chance. Climbing up to her floor, though-what message would that send?

Vincent had no intention of coming across as someone who would pester her after the divorce and even chase her all the way to her company. She already had enough reasons to find him exasperating.
Suddenly, the entire building went pitch black.

"Looks like a power outage," Derek remarked.

Vincent's reaction was immediate. Hannah did not do well in the dark. "I'm going up. Do we have an emergency flashlight in the car?"

"We've got one," Derek replied.

A quick handoff followed as Derek retrieved the flashlight and placed it in Vincent's grip.

Meanwhile,upstairs, Hannah's progress had been painstaking. She watched her program crawl up to 90%,but then the screen went dark, erasing a night's worth of effort.

A glance out her window revealed the rest of Cerulean Bay glowing with light. The blackout seemed to be limited to her own building. Not wasting a second, she activated her phone's flashlight and got ready to leave.

Encouragement echoed in her mind, telling her to go straight for the exit without looking back.

Passing by the front desk, something unexpected stopped her in her tracks. A strange red light flickered to life on the marble reception counter, painting the area in crimson.

Without thinking, she jerked backward, the cold doorframe pressing against the back of her neck.

Somehow, a bouquet of red roses had appeared atop the marble, as if conjured out of thin air.

Weakness crept into her knees, but she pushed herself toward the emergency stairwell, holding her breath as she hurried down the steps.

Midway down, a prickling sensation told her something wasn't right. The echo of footsteps-ones that weren't hers-filled the stairwell.

Realizing she wasn't alone, her heart pounded harder. She yanked off her heels and darted faster, desperate to escape, but a misstep sent her ankle twisting painfully. ###Chapter 184 Carrying Her Down


Hannah clenched her jaw, pushing through the sharp, relentless pain as sweat dotted her forehead. She gripped the railing tightly, limping carefully down the stairs.

The footsteps behind her grew louder and nearer. Quietly, she fumbled in her bag, clutching the pepper spray tightly, holding her breath to steady the frantic beat of her heart.

"Hannah!" A voice echoed sharply through the darkness.

Vincent? Hannah's brows knitted together in confusion. What was he doing here?

Still, recognizing the voice eased her fear slightly. She steadied herself against the railing and cautiously continued downward.

When a beam of light from below flickered up the stairwell, Hannah called out weakly, "I'm here."

Hearing her voice, Vincent quickened his steps and quickly reached her side.

"Are you hurt?"

"What the hell brought you here?"

They spokesimultaneously.

Hannah switched off the flashlight on her phone and shook her head dismissively. "I'm fine."

Vincent exhaled sharply, visibly relieved. Ignoring her question, he asked coldly, "Does your company rely solely on you to stay afloat? It's nearly eleven, and you're still not home."

For a brief moment, seeing Vincent appear out of the darkness had made her feel genuinely grateful. But after hearing his sharp remark, her gratitude faded instantly. "Exactly. And whose fault is that? Nova Tech wouldn't be struggling this much if it weren't for you."

Vincent fell silent, unable or unwilling to argue back.
Hannah asked, "So why are you here?"

Vincent brushed past her, taking the lead. "I was just passing by."

Hannah followed closely behind, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "What a convenient coincidence."

Vincent paused, allowing her to move ahead.

Just as he stepped behind her, the flashlight in his hand flickered unsteadily before plunging the stairwell into darkness.

Hannah immediately tried switching her phone's flashlight back on-only to discover it had died.Panic rising, she clutched the handrail tighter. "Where's your phone? Turn on your flashlight!"

Pitch black enveloped them. With her night blindness, Hannah felt utterly vulnerable, frozen in place.

Vincent had already begun patting his pockets the moment the flashlight went out, but he couldn't find his phone. "I forgot it. I'll guide you down."

He reached out to take Hannah's wrist, but she stubbornly clung to the railing. "I...I'll just go slow."

The darkness in front of her seemed endless, every step feeling like a dangerous leap into the unknown. She inched forward, hesitant and afraid.

Impatient, Vincent decided not to waste another moment. Swiftly, he stepped two stairs down, turned around,and lifted Hannah onto his back in one fluid movement.

Hannah yelped in surprise, her voice echoing sharply through the stairwell, "What are you doing?"

"Carrying you," Vincent replied calmly, readjusting her weight securely.

His shoulder dug awkwardly into her chest, and she wriggled uncomfortably. "Put me down! I can walk."

"Stop squirming," Vincent warned firmly. "If I trip, we'll both go down."

Reluctantly, Hannah ceased struggling, though she didn't give up protesting entirely. "Then put me down already."
Vincent didn't answer, simply continuing down the staircase with steady determination, Hannah secured on his back.

Behind the fire exit they had just passed, a shadow moved quietly, slipping away unnoticed.

When they finally emerged into the brightly lit space outside, Vincent carefully set Hannah down.

She wobbled slightly, barely able to stand. Vincent's eyes drifted downward, his expression darkening when he saw her badly swollen right ankle.

He crouched beside her foot. Hannah instinctively tried to step back, but he firmly held her in place."You call this fine?" he asked, his voice tense with concern.

"None of your business," Hannah retorted sharply, forcing herself to limp forward stubbornly. Her only wish now was to hail a cab and get home as quickly as possible.

But before she could take another step, Vincent scooped her effortlessly into his arms. Ignoring her startled protests, he swiftly carried her to the waiting Bentley and shoved her inside.

As Hannah reached for the door, Vincent silently signaled Derek, who promptly locked it.

Frustration clear on her face, Hannah glared at Vincent. "Now what are you up to?"

Vincent stared straight ahead. "Taking you to the hospital."
###Chapter 185 I Didn't Mean Anything By It


The emergency room at Dorbarrow Hospital ruled out any fracture in Hannah's ankle. The doctor handed her an ice pack, reassuring her she only needed to rest and let time do the healing.

Hannah casually tossed the ice pack over her ankle and grabbed her phone, finally charged after what felt like hours of waiting.

Sure enough,missed calls piled up from her parents-each notification like a tiny stab of guilt.

She called them back, not even bothering to sugarcoat the truth about her injury. The moment they heard "sprain," her parents insisted on coming to the hospital. She tried to protest, but there was no getting around their worry.

With a sigh, she ended the call and then suddenly flinched as she felt warm hands on her ankle. Startled,she yanked her foot away and shot Vincent a glare. "Why are you still here?"

Vincent perched himself on the edge of the bed, gently pulling her ankle back toward him with gentle fingers. "The doctor said you need to ice it, but you're supposed to massage it,too."

"I'm perfectly capable of handling it myself. My hands work just fine, you know." Hannah tugged her foot away and nestled the ice pack back over her ankle. "Just leave already."

He shot her a dry look, then got to his feet and strode out of the room.

Without sparing him another thought, Hannah grabbed her phone. A breaking alert flashed across the screen: Polaris Tech stock nosedives to record low-bankruptcy fears intensify.

Her brows knit in concern as she scanned the headline.

Roughly ten minutes later, Margaret and Raymond burst into the emergency room, out of breath and visibly shaken.

Margaret immediately bent to inspect her daughter's ankle, her expression tight with worry. "How did you manage this? Your ankle's completely swollen, Hannah."

Hannah tried to play it down. "It's not broken. Just a bad sprain."

Raymond's frown deepened, confusion flickering across his face. "What happened to the company's electricity? Why did everything suddenly go dark?"

Hannah shook her head, puzzled herself. "I'll call property management tomorrow and find out."

She glanced out the window at the glowing skyline-every other building in Cerulean Bay sparkled with light.Only Building 9 sat in darkness, as if it alone had been singled out.

Before Hannah could announce she was ready to leave, the door swung open again.

Vincent came back, pushing a wheelchair forward.

Irritation flickered across Hannah's face. "Why haven't you left?"

Margaret's voice sharpened, bristling with accusation. "Mr. Jones, it's time for you to go. Don't hand your mother another excuse to make trouble for my daughter."

Raymond stepped forward, his expression turning stormy as he placed himself squarely between Hannah and Vincent.

Vincent wanted to greet Hannah's parents politely, but with their evident dislike for him, the words caught in his throat. Instead, he parked the wheelchair quietly by the bedside. "I just brought this for you."

Hannah's gaze drifted to the wheelchair. It wasn't a standard hospital wheelchair-she had no idea where he'd gotten it, but with his connections, getting his hands on one wouldn't have taken much effort. She looked away, her tone cool. "You don't need to go to all that trouble. The hospital already has plenty."

Margaret's voice was sharpo and dismissive. "Take it and leave. We don't want anything from you."

Raymond's voice went colder than ever. "You're already divorced from our daughter. Don't make things messier than they already are."

Vincent's fingers tightened around the wheelchair's handles, knuckles paling. "I didn't mean anything by it. This chair is just more comfortable than the hospital's. I thought it might help her."

Margaret, patience fraying, nudged Vincent toward the doorway. "Enough. Leave. Don't show up in front of us again."

Before Vincent could get a word in, the door swung open and Danica swept in like a thundercloud, planting herself squarely between him and Margaret.

Danica shoved Margaret aside. "Don't touch my son!"

Ever since the fiasco with Brinley, the Jones family estate had witnessed uniformed police officers come and leave to collect evidence. The whole ordeal had bothered Danica deeply, haunted by the idea of being mocked for this scandal by the upper society. Due to the mounting distress, her migraines had been relentless, prompting this hospital visit.

Now, running straight into Hannah's family, Danica didn't hesitate to lay blame where it suited her. In her mind, Hannah was the reason the Jones family had unraveled into chaos.

As soon as Danica stormed in, Hannah instinctively pulled Margaret back, her gaze hardening as she fretted that Danica might once again attack her mother.

Vincent quickly tried to urge Danica out. "Mom,please leave now."

Danica, face flushed with rage, refused to budge. "I saw everything, Vincent! That shrew is nothing but trouble!"

Danica's shout cut through the room. The sting of Margaret's past insults burned fresh in her mind-there was no way she'd let it slide.

Margaret, already in a foul mood, bristled with indignation at Danica's words. Her jaw tightened, words poised to fly-but Hannah reached over, gently pulling her mother back before she could unleash her temper.

Hannah's voice sliced through the tension, cold and piercing. "Oh, so my mom's a shrew? What does that make you, then-a bitter woman who lashes out at everyone around her just to make herself feel better?Didn't you learn your lesson last time? Or are you hoping to follow in Brinley's footsteps and see what jail time really feels like?"

Danica's breath came in ragged bursts, fury boiling over inside her. The last few days had been nothing short of hell, and now Hannah's taunts tipped her over the edge. Her gaze flicked wildly across the room and then landed on a pitcher of water within arm's reach.

Before anyone could react, Danica snatched it up and hurled its contents straight at Hannah's face. "I'll wipe that smug grin right off you!"

But the water never reached Hannah. Vincent moved faster than anyone thought possible, stepping in front of Hannah at the last second and taking the icy splash square in the chest.

"Vincent!" Danica gasped.

Water dripped from Vincent's clothes as he fixed Danica with an icy glare. "What's wrong with you? Have you completely lost your mind?"
###Chapter 186 Someone Was Watching Her


Danica acted purely on instinct, so much so that she forgot Vincent was still standing there. The reality of what she'd just done hit her, and her arms fell limply to her sides, leaving her at a loss for words.

Vincent flicked the droplets of water from his shirt without much concern and then turned toward Hannah and her parents. "Sorry for the disturbance. We'll be going now."

"Wait! Mr. Jones, you left something behind," Hannah called out before he could leave.

With a clear note of irritation, Margaret shoved the wheelchair forward.

Vincent didn't bother looking back. His tone was even as he said, "That's for you."

Hannah's voice was icy. "I don't want it. I don't want to accept any favors from you." She turned to Raymond. "Dad, move that thing out of here.I don't want to see it."

"Alright, whatever you say." Raymond promptly wheeled it toward the doorway and stood there, clearly waiting for Vincent and Danica to leave.

A glance at the wheelchair darkened Vincent's gaze, but he said nothing more and walked out. Danica scrambled to catch up.

The door slammed shut behind them with a sharp bang.

Vincent kept his head slightly bowed, eyes downcast.

Unable to hold back, Danica muttered, "Talk about ungrateful."

Vincent gave her a brief, disapproving look but continued forward, his frown deepening.

Danica rushed after him, blurting, "Vincent, are you alright? I didn't mean to splash you back there..."

Vincent came to a halt, his eyes cold. "So it was alright if you'd thrown the water at Hannah instead? And what if that water had been hot? You didn't even check-you just threw it!"
Danica latched on to the wrong detail and panicked. "It was hot? Oh my! We need to get you checked by a doctor right now!"

She reached for him, but Vincent recoiled, pulling his arm out of reach. "From this moment on, stay away from Hannah and her family."

"I wasn't here for them, you know. I only came to the hospital because I needed to see a doctor," Danica replied. "And for what it's worth, I was actually worried about you."

Vincent shut her down before she could say more. "That's enough. Just do as I say." Without another glance, he strode ahead.

Danica called after him, "What, you're just going to leave your mother like this?"

"I've got something to take care of," Vincent replied over his shoulder without slowing down or looking back.

Danica stomped her foot in frustration, anger still simmering. The Scotts always meant trouble. She'd poured years of her life into the Jones family, but Vincent seemed to be slipping further and further out of reach.

Meanwhile, Vincent made his way to the parking lot. As soon as he slid into his car, his phone rang-Derek was on the line.

Vincent had previously asked Derek to look into the blackout at Building 9 in Cerulean Bay.

Derek said, "I've finished the investigation, Mr. Jones. Turns out there wasn't any technical issue. Someone deliberately cut the main circuit."

Vincent's tone hardened. "Did you find out who did it?"

"Not yet. Whoever did it took out the building's security cameras too."

A heavy silence followed before Vincent issued a short command. "Assign someone to discreetly follow Hannah for the next few days. Report anything unusual." Hannah spent the next two days recovering at home, grateful as the swelling in her ankle finally began to fade.

That afternoon, she received a message from Interpol. "The evidence is solid. Brinley Gilbert indeed colluded with Paige Morphew. She's been handed a ten-year sentence for her part in human trafficking."

At last, Brinley had been taken into custody-Hannah felt a rush of relief and triumph.

With the Al-integrated wristband project entering a crucial phase, Hannah wanted to be there in person.By the third day, she was back at her office, determined to keep things on track.

Felix came by her office as soon as he heard she was back. "Why not give yourself a bit more time to recover?"

"I'm fine, really. The swelling's already gone down," Hannah assured him, flashing a smile."|just need to oversee the Al integration. As soon as it's set, I'll head home and take it easy."

"Very well, if you insist," Felix said, though he still looked a little concerned.

A sudden thought struck Hannah. "Did the building management ever find out what caused the blackout?"

Felix's expression darkened. "Nothing with the wiring. Still don't know who was behind the power outage.I'll give you a ride home tonight, just to be safe."

Hannah didn't argue-safety came first. Then, another worry surfaced. "By the way, I wasn't at the officethe last two days. Has anyone sent roses?"

"I haven't seen any new deliveries," Felix answered, thinking it over.

Hannah exhaled a quiet sigh of relief. Maybe the prank.was finally over.

But right before she could leave for the day, the receptionist appeared at her office door, holding a bouquet of fresh roses.

Hannah accepted the flowers, staring in confusion. She almost tossed them aside, expecting the usual anonymity, but this time something was different-a small card was nestled among the blooms. It read,"You've been away two days. I missed you more than you know."A chill ran through Hannah. Her heart skipped.Someone was watching her.
###Chapter 187 Vincent's Woman Smells Amazing


Over the next few days, Hannah found herself overly cautious. She'd reported her concerns to the police,but with no real harm done, they couldn't do much for her.

Playing it safe, she started limiting her trips to the office. Whenever she did need to be there, she made sure to leave right on time, with Felix insisting on driving her home every evening.

Her ankle was nearly back to normal-she still couldn't run, but at least walking was no longer a struggle.

Something else dawned on her: ever since she began mixing up her schedule, the mysterious roses had stopped arriving. Maybe whoever was behind the prank had gotten bored and given up.

On this particular day, Hannah avoided the usual morning crowd by heading out just after 10:30 a.m.

She kept switching up her speed on the road-sometimes zipping ahead, other times slowing down-and soon spotted a car in her rearview mirror, matching her every move.

Thankfully, Hannah's driving skills hadn't faded. With a series of sharp turns, she mnanaged to shake the tailing vehicle, ducking into the Cerulean Bay parking garage and locking her car swiftly.

While she waited by the elevator, she scrolled through her phone, glancing at work messages. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed someone approaching, a man with his hat pulled low. Assuming he was just another elevator passenger, she stepped slightly aside to make room.

But something about his body language set off alarms. She carefully studied him, not wanting to seem obvious.

The man was bundled up, face hidden, and clutching what looked disturbingly like a stick.

Hannah's hand clamped tighter around her phone. Her heart hammered in her chest.

The elevator doors opened with a ding. Reacting fast, she stepped back, grabbed her pepper spray, and sprayed several quick bursts in his direction. Without looking back, she sprinted for the stairwell,her instincts screaming at her to run.

The man flinched away from the pepper spray, furious. He snatched up the stick he'd dropped and charged after her.

Hannah dashed up the stairs, determined to reach the first-floor lobby where she could finally call for help.

Her hand was on the door when he caught up, clamping a hand over her mouth and pressing close,inhaling the scent of her skin. "Vincent's woman smells amazing."

His voice rang with an eerie familiarity, though Hannah couldn't quite place where she'd heard it before.

Acting on instinct, she bit down hard on his hand. But instead of retreating, the man seemed to relish it,tightening his grip as he tried to drag her further down the stairs.

Hannah refused to go down easily. Letting go of his hand, she twisted sharply and drove her elbow straight into his stomach.

The blow caught him off guard, making him grunt and loosen his hold.

Hannah pulled herself free and bolted up the stairs.

But before she got far, something slammed into the back of her neck. Her vision spun. As darkness closed in, she barely registered the stick clattering to the floor-and the man's low, threatening murmur,"SO stubborn... Looks like you'll need a little nap."

Then,everything faded to black.

Elsewhere, Vincent was on the phone with the bodyguards he'd assigned to shadow Hannah. "We've lost her," one of the guards reported.

A stormy look crossed Vincent's face. "Did she spot you?"

"No, Mr. Jones. But we just saw Ms. Scott's car parked at Cerulean Bay," the guard answered, trying to reassure him.

"That doesn't prove anything. I want you to verify that Hannah is actually safe," Vincent ordered, his voicewas sharp, leaving no room for argument.

"Understood. We're heading to Nova Tech now."

As soon as the call ended, Vincent began pacing restlessly across his office floor. He couldn't stand waiting around any longer.Snatching up his jacket, he decided to go to Nova Tech himself.

As soon as Vincent arrived, the bodyguards reported that Hannah was nowhere to be found in the office.

"Pull up the security cameras," Vincent said, his expression dark and tense.

"Right away."

In no time, the guards had the footage queued up.

Vincent leaned in, replaying the video repeatedly, his eyes locked on every detail at each entrance and exit.

The last trace of Hannah was in the parking garage. After that, she never appeared on any of the exit cameras.

"Spread out and sweep the entire parking level and nearby areas," Vincent instructed. "Lock down every exit in this building. No one leaves until we find her."
###Chapter 188 A Close Call


Vincent and the bodyguards split up to search every corner, but Hannah was still nowhere in sight.

Vincent's gaze grew darker as he ran through every scenario he could think of. Was there something he'd missed? Then, a detail surfaced in his mind-the layout of Building 9 he'd glimpsed before. If he remembered right, the eleventh floor was now empty after the previous tenants moved out.

Without wasting a second, he gave a new order, "Search the eleventh floor. Now!"

···
Meanwhile, Hannah slowly regained consciousness, only to find her wrists and ankles lashed tightly to a chair, unable to budge an inch.

"Look who's finally awake. I've been waiting for this moment." The man grinned as he reached out to touch her face.

She jerked her head away from his hand. "Who are you? What do you want?"

"You really don't remember me? That's a little dlisappointing, but it's fine. I'm going to sleep with you anyway." A nasty sneer curled his lips. "Let's see what Vincent's ex-wife is really like, shall we?"

The man's face twisted with cruel excitement as he pulled down his pants, leaving only his underwear.

Disgust churned in Hannah's gut. She could guess his intentions, and as he stalked toward her with a predatory grin, she shouted, "Wait! Aren't you worried Vincent will come after you?"

The man laughed, utterly unbothered. "Him? What's there to be afraid of? The only reason anyone listens to him is because of his father. I've never understood why people act scared around him."

Hannah didn't interrupt him, working her wrists against a jagged nail she'd felt behind the chair, hoping she could somehow cut herself free.

"I could've had you that night when the lights went out," the man continued, rage simmering in his eyes.
"But Vincent barged in and ruined everything.I've had to wait all this time because of him-damn him to hell!"

He leaned in so close that Hannah could feel his breath on her skin. "You owe me for that little setback.Make it worth my while."

"So you're the one behind the roses? You also killed the power?" Hannah kept stalling for time.

A wicked grin split his face. "That's right. Every single rose was from me. Red suits you best, don't you think?" He stripped off his shirt, his gaze hungry.

Out of nowhere, he produced a bouquet of. crimson roses. "Today, with these as our witnesses, we'll have our fun. No one's coming to stop us. I can't wait anymore," he said, lunging toward her with dangerous intent.

"Wait!" Hannah cried out.

He paused, scowling. "You're stalling, aren't you?"

"No." She shook her head, dropping her gaze. "I know there's no getting out of this. But... It's daylight.I'm embarrassed. Would you close the curtains first? Please, just... Don't hurt me. I'll do whatever you want."

He let out a coarse laugh. "That's more likeit. Be good and I'll treat you well. I guarantee I'll be better than Vincent-in bed and out of it."

He trailed a hand down her cheek before finally turning away, half undressed, to draw the curtains.

Revulsion nearly overwhelmed Hannah, but she held on to her composure. If she was going to escape, this was the only chance she'd get. Her fingers worked furiously at the rope, and just as he tugged the last curtain closed, the knot around her wrists finally gave way.

Wasting no time, she freed her legs and made a break for what she thought was the door.

A furious shout erupted behind her. "You tricked me!"

Hannah continued to bolt, desperate, only to discover the wall of glass offered no escape. With nowhere else to turn, she snatched a glass tumbler from the table and raised it, her voice shaking bout defiant. "Don't

A twisted smile flickered across the man's face as he lunged. Hannah hurled the tumbler as hard as she could.

The glass exploded against his head, a jagged piece cutting across his temple. Blood streamed down, but the hit only seemed to excite him further. "Interesting... This is more fun than tying you up."

Hannah tried to dodge him, but he moved faster. He kicked her in the knee, forcing her down onto the floor.

He stood over her, stripping away his underwear. Grabbing a fistful of her hair, he dragged her closer."Do it.Lick it."

A wave of disgust and rage surged through Hannah. Out of the corner of her eye, she spotted a gleaming shard of broken glass. Her hand closed around it, every muscle trembling.

The moment the man forced Hannah's head toward his groin, she drove the shard into his penis with all her might.

A scream tore from his throat as he crumpled, writhing in agony. Blood poured from his wound, and her own hand dripped red, but she didn't stop to check. All that mattered was getting away.

She scrambled to her feet, adrenaline and fear pushing her forward.

Suddenly, glass shattered behind her, and a rush of air swept through as someone kicked the door open.The next instant, she was wrapped in strong, familiar arms.

Vincent's voice came from above, calm and commanding. "Don't look. It's filthy. Just keep your eyes on me."
###Chapter 189 Time For Them To Go Bankrupt


A frosty glint flashed in Vincent's eyes as he took in the chaos before him.

"We're getting out of here," Vincent murmured, locking an arm protectively around Hannah and steering her toward the door.

Meanwhile, the man sprang up, snatching the stick off the floor and swinging it at Hannah's head. Vincent reacted instantly, twisting to shield her. The stick crashed down on his shoulder.

Pain ripped through Vincent, but he barely flinched. Whirling around, he drove his boot into the man's chest,sending the latter sprawling. For a moment, Vincent's expression was all shadows and murder, cold,unyielding.

Hannah stared at Vincent, stunned-she had never seen him so utterly furious.

Just then, Vincent's security team burst onto the scene.

Vincent didn't spare the man another glance. "He's all yours," he said in a voice like ice, keeping his arm tightly around Hannah as he led her out.

The second they made it ouutside, Hannah's legs buckled. She collapsed, and Vincent caught her before she hit the ground.

Fury simmered in Vincent's voice. "Did that bastard drug you?"

Hannah tried to respond, but the strength left her body, and everything went black.

Vincent swept her into his arms and headed hastily for the hospital.

From a dark corner, a hidden camera lens snapped a photo of Vincent carrying Hannah away.

Inside Dorbarrow Hospital, the doctor's reassurance that Hannah was neither injured nor drugged has finally allowed Vinċent to exhale, relief washing over him.
Then, his phone rang-it was one of his bodyguards."Mr. Jones, we have a name. Darren Wolfe, CEO of Aetherion Corp. He claims he saw Ms. Scott at a bidding event and became obsessed. The eleventh floor is owned by his uncle."

"Where is he now?" Vincent's voice was low and raw, his eyes rimmed red.

"We still have him," the bodyguard replied with a firm, respectful voice.

"I'll be there soon." After ending the call, Vincent called Rena, asking her to stay with Hannah before he left quietly.

Meanwhile, in the Jones Group's private parking garage, Darren was bound tightly to a concrete pillar.

Upon arrival, the self-control Vincent had managed to hold onto snapped. He unleashed a barrage of punches,not giving Darren a moment to plead for mercy.

It didn't take long for Darren's face to become an unrecognizable mess, blood streaming down as he struggled to stay upright.

Finally, a bodyguard stepped in. "Mr. Jones, if you keep going, he won't survive."

Vincent paused, breath ragged. He wiped the blood from his knuckles with a handkerchief and let it drop to the ground without a second glance..

"Should we hand him over to the authorities?" the bodyguard asked.

A cold, derisive chuckle escaped Vincent. "Let him off that easy? Not a chance."

Vincent strode toward his car, voice flat. "Ship him to the casinos."

The moment Darren was thrown into that world, debts would begin stacking higher and higher, shutting the door on any chance of reclaiming his former life.

Vincent rested one hand on the car window, eyes glinting."Oh, and while you're at it-destroy his company and his uncle's too... time for them to go bankrupt."

"Understood," the bodyguard replied with unwavering respect. Vincentdrove away, never looking back.

···
Hannah spent a full day and night lost to sleep. When she finally woke up, the first thing she saw was Rena seated patiently at her side.

"Rena... Why are you here?" Hannah's voice was still weak, her complexion drained of color.

Rena's eyes were rimmed with red as she leaned forward and hugged Hannah tightly. "Hannah,I heard everything.Thank God you're okay."

Hannah managed a small, reassuring smile and gently patted Rena's shoulder.

"Felix has also been waiting for you to come to, but work called him away for something urgent,"Rena continued.

Rena chattered on for a bit, her words tumbling out in a rush before adding,"And Vincent-he really gave that bastard a brutal lesson."

Hannah's expression grew serious. "Who was that man?"

"I dug into it. He's the CEO of Aetherion Corp. CEO, my ass. The kind of scum who does this doesn't deserve the title."

The name triggered something in Hannah's memory. During the VitraMind bidding event, when her company had wonthe bid, the CEO of Aetherion Corp had come up to congratulate them. No wonder his voice had struck a chord of recognition.

Rena was still steaming. "You wouldn't believe it-Vincent didn't just beat that bastard up. He crushed that bastard and forced it into liquidation. And as if that wasn't enough, he had that bastard dumped in a casino.Just one day in and he's already up to his neck in loan shark debts. Honestly, prison would've been a mercy."

She gave an exaggerated eye roll. "I never thought much of Vincent before, but I'll give credit where it's due.This time, he really delivered."
###Chapter 190 Erica Stanton


Hannah listened quietly, her face betraying little, though a hint of confusion lingered in her eyes. One question stuck with her. How had Vincent managed to appear at exactly the crucial moment? "Where is Vincent?" she asked suddenly.

Rena's voice brimmed with concern. "You're worried about him? Hannah, don't let a handful of heroic acts sway your judgment. You can't just forgive everything he's done."

Hannah gave a gentle smile. "That's not it. I just need to ask him something."

Relief swept over Rena. "Alright, I just didn't want you to go soft on him. Still, I heard his shoulder injury wasn't minor."

"Do you know which room he's staying in?" Hannah asked after a moment's thought.

Rena hesitated. "I do... Are you thinking of visiting him?"

With a soft laugh, Hannah shook her head. "No, but he did save me. That's something I can't ignore. Could you thank him for me instead?"

She pulled out a bank card and handed it to Rena. "There should be a million on this. It's for him-and for the bodyguards who helped."

Rena hesitated, reluctant. "I doubt Vincent would ever need your money."

"That's not the point. He saved my life, and he got hurt doing it. I just want to repay the favor, no debts left behind," Hannah said calmly. No matter if it was back when she was in danger abroad or the recent ordeal,Vincent had come through for her, and he'd gotten hurt because of it. She didn't want to owe him anything -it was best to settle it now.

After a moment of hesitation, Rena nodded and accepted the card."Okay.I'll make sure he gets it."

A while later, Rena arrived at Vincent's ward. She handed him the card, and his expression tightened, a deep crease forming between his brows."What's this about?" he asked, voice sharp.

"Hannah told me to give you this. One million, to settle the debt. She said that makes you even. No debts,no ties."

Vincent's frown only deepened. "She actually said that?"

"She did. She also-"

But before Rena could finish, Vincent snatched the card from her hand and strode out of the ward without another word.

"Hey! Where are you going?" Rena called out, hurrying after him.

Inside her ward, Hannah heard the commotion in the hallway and perked up, expecting Rena's return and slightly surprised by her efficiency. But when the door swung open, it was Vincent standing there, not her friend. The word "Rena" died on her lips.

"What's the matter? Didn't think it was enough?" Hannah asked.

Vincent, still in hospital clothes, stood by her bedside for a long moment, staring at her in silence before finally offering the card back. "I don't need your money."

Hannah's voice was detached. "Just take it. I don't like owing anyone."

"You don't owe me a thing," Vincent replied,voice lower now.

"Take it anyway. Give it to your bodyguards as a bonus or something," she replied as she slipped the card into his pocket.

Vincent frowned at her stubbornness.

Before the tension could thicken further, Hannah spoke again.′′One more thing. Why did you show up right when you did?"

Vincent took a breath and then answered honestly,′′After the blackout, I haven't figured out who was behind it and couldn't shake the feeling you might be in danger, so I had people keeping an eye on you. I just never thought we'd still be almost too late."

With Vincent's explanation, Hannah's suspicions finally faded away. Keeping her voice level, she said,"Mr.Jones, next time you pull something like this, at least give me a warning. Having strangers tail me is seriously unnerving."

Vincent offered a quiet apology and added, "I thought you'd refuse if I asked."

She brushed it off. "Never mind. There won't be a next time anyway." Done with the conversation,she made a subtle gesture toward the door. "That's alII wanted to discuss. You can go now."

A dry,humorless laugh escaped Vincent. "Not even going to ask how I'm doing?"

Hannah's tone was cool as she answered, "I'm sure someone like you will receive the best medical care."

Vincent lingered, silent, just watching her.

Suddenly,a cheerful woman's voice cut through the room."Vincent! I heard you were hurt and came as fast as I could. How's your back? Let me see!"

Without waiting for an answer, the speaker stepped forward, hands reaching for Vincent's hospital gown.

Vincent immediately retreated, frowning in discomfort. "Erica, what are you doing here?"

Erica Stanton was the daughter of Sharon's late comrade-in-arms. After the comrade's death, Sharon had adopted Erica. Erica, Vincent's senior by two years, had spent most of her life working far from home since Vincent's college years.

Erica pouted. "I should be asking you! I just got back and heard you'd been injured. By the time I reached your ward, you'd already disappeared."

Then, her gaze shifted to Hannah, sitting upright in the hospital bed. With a purposeful tug at Vincent's sleeve and a calculated grin, she asked, "So, is this your new girlfriend? You're not going to introduce me?"

Hannah's response was perfectly composed. "You're mistaken. I'm his ex-wife." Vincent's expression clouded over . Erica's mouth fell open in mock shock. She slapped a hand over her lips. "Hold on-you're Hannah Scott?The one who landed Brinley in prison?"
###Chapter 191 She Wanted To Be The Woman By His Side


Hannah arched a brow, making no effort to deny the obvious.

Only then did Erica remember to introduce herself. "Hi, I'm Erica Stanton, Vincent's aunt. Work's kept me out of town for a long time."

Letting out a gentle sigh, she continued, "I missed your wedding entirely. Never imagined I'd come back to find you two in this situation. It's really such a pity."

Hannah met her gaze with a cool, almost amused smile."It's not quite a pity. You still get to attend Mr.Jones' wedding when he remarries."

Erica's heart skipped a beat. She asked tentatively,′′WVait, are you saying you and Vincent are getting back together this quickly? Freshly divorced, and now a remarriage is on the horizon? Then it's time for the preparation of the big day."

Realizing Erica got the wrong idea, Hannah remarked, her smile slipping away, "You've got it wrong. He is free to marry whoever he wants-just not me."

Vincent's gaze fell to the floor, his expression unreadable.

Erica glanced at him and then gave Hannah an awkward smile.

The hospital room fell into an uncomfortable hush.

After a moment, Vincent headed toward the door, his voice quiet but firm.′′Weshould get going. Let's not disturb her any longer."

Erica nodded and trailed after him.

Not long after they left, Rena breezed in, curiosity sparkling in her eyes. "Hannah, who was that woman with Vincent just now?"

Without looking up, Hannah unlocked her phone and scrolled through a news app. "His aunt," she answered flatly.

"His aunt?" Rena's brows shot up in surprise. "She looked so young." She then lowered her voice in a whisper. "I saw her trailing after Vincent, standing outside your room for a while before finally coming in.Honestly, it looked like she came here just for you."

Hannah remembered Erica's earlier words and gave Rena's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Don't worry. I'm done with the Jones family. No more tangled connections."

Aside from Sharon, Hannah had no intention of ever dealing with any of the Jones family again.

Meanwhile, in Vincent's hospital room, Erica lingered at the foot of the bed after a few questions about his condition, visibly hesitating before she spoke. "Life's funny, isn't it? I honestly thought you left Hannah because of Brinley, but now look-Brinley's locked up."

Vincent's eyes turned stormy as he muttered, "I never had any romantic feelings for Brinley."

Masking her glee, Erica pressed on. "Then what really happened? Why did you and Hannah split up?"

Keeping his tone icy, he answered, "She's the one who wanted the divorce."

Erica masked her eagerness to know his feelings toward Hannah with a light tone. "Oh? From the way you're sulking, don't tell me you're still hung up on her?"

Vincent's patience snapped. Erica had been digging into his love life since her return. He turned away,refusing to respond.

Erica shifted into his line of sight. "Vincent, I just care about you, that's all."

He scowled, his jaw tight. "If you're that worried, maybe focus on my work instead of my private life."

Lately, Vincent had thrown himself into launching a high-stakes project-one with the power to double the Jones Group's value if it took off. The entire company was watching his every move.

Erica let out a soft laugh. "What's the point of worrying about whether you've faced any obstacles in work when you're that exceptional? You've always handled business better than anyone."
An awkward quiet settled between them, the silence stretching until Vincent finally broke it. "How long are you staying this time?When do you plan to head back?"

"I'm not leaving this time," Erica declared, her gaze drifting to the window, a faint smile softening her features.

Vincent's brows lifted in mild surprise, but he quickly regained his composure. "That's good. Grandma will be glad to hear it."

A wistful smile curved on Erica's lips. Years ago, everyone thought she'd stormed out of the Jones family estate after some petty spat with Sharon. But the real reason had always been Vincent-she couldn't stand the prospect of him getting engaged to Brinley, so she left before her jealousy could swallow her whole.

Later, when Brinley moved overseas, Erica had dared to hope again. Maybe, finally, it was her turn. But Hannah had arrived in Vincent's life like a storm, and once more, Erica had been forced to wait on the sidelines.

After hearing about Vincent and Hannah's divorce, Erica hadn't even been delighted as she was certain Brinley would marry Vincent soon. No one saw Brinley's downfall coming-until she was handed her prison sentence.

Erica had never wanted the role of Vincent's aunt. She yearned to be the woman by his side. This time, she was determined to fight for her chance, no matter the cost.

Still, the way Vincent spoke about Hannah made it clear-his heart hadn't let go. And as long as Hannah lingered in his life, Erica knew she'd never stand a chance.



Two days later, Hannah was discharged from the hospital.

To thank Rena for taking care of her over the past few days, Hannah invited her out for a little retail therapy at Vista Mall.

They wandered into an upscale boutique. Rena moved slowly between displays, examining handbags with quiet fascination, while Hannah settled onto a plush sofa nearby, stretching her legs and letting herself relax.

The peaceful atmosphere shattered as a sharp, mocking voice rang out from across the showroom.

"Ma'am, be careful where you're putting your hands. If you break anything, you won't be able to pay for it," a male sales assistant sneered, her arms folded and chin lifted in contempt. "These are designer handbags,not bargain-bin ggroceries."

The target of her scorn-lrene Whitaker, dressed in simple, unfashionable clothes-smiled politely,undeterred. "Don't worry. I'm being very gentle. Could you please show me the red one up there on the top shelf?"

The sales assistant shot her a look of pure disdain. "Absolutely not. Those are part of our premium collection.If you mess one up, you think you could pay for it?"
###Chapter 192 Miles' Mother


Irene lowered her head awkwardly and quietly placed the designer bag from her hand back on the shelf.

Unable to watch any longer, Hannah stepped forward, her tone firm as she addressed the male sales assistant, "As a salesperson, it's your job to treatevery customer with respect. Your attitude is completely out of line."

The sales assistant looked Hannah up and down, clearly unimpressed by her simple outfit, and scoffed,pointing at Irene. "And how exactly did I mistreat her? I showed her everything she asked for, didn'tl?"

"Then take down all the bags on the top row and let her have a look," Hannah said, her gaze unwavering.

The sales assistant stood motionless, his disdain unmistakable."Do you even know how much those cost?You think I'll just take them down because you asked? The cheapest one up there is at least a million dollars.Shocked?"

Without a word, Hannah pulled a black card. "Can we see them now?" she asked coolly.

The sales assistant's expression stiffened for a moment, but he quickly masked it with mockery as he glanced at her face. "What's so impressive about getting a black card by hooking up with a rich guy? I don't serve gold-diggers," he sneered.

Irene, standing beside Hannah, became furious. "How could you say something like that about her?"

"Did I say anything wrong?" the sales assistant fired back. "She's so young and already holding a black card. If not by relying on a man, how else could she have it?"

Hannah didn't waste another word. Her palm landed hard across his face.

Stunned, the sales assistant stared at her, eyes wide. "How dare you slap me?"

"You insulted me first. What's wrong with me teaching you a lesson?" Hannah replied, pulling Irene over to the sofa. "I will pursue this matter. Get your manager here."


Rena,who had heard the commotion, rushed over. "Hannah, what's going on?"

Hannah gave her a quick rundown. "This sales assistant accused me of getting my black card by relying on a man. I'm about to speak to the manager."

Rena's expression darkened instantly."My friend earns her cash through running her own company. She doesn't need to depend on anyone."

Now visibly nervous, the sales assistant quickly approached the store manager, who had just arrived. "She hit me! You need to stand up for me!" the sales assistant hastily said.

But the manager didn't even look at the sales assistant. She walked straight toward Hannah and Rena,her voice respectful. "Ms. Scott, Miss Brown, how can I assist you?"

Both Hannah and Rena were on the store's VIP client list. The manager had only stepped away briefly, and in that short time, everything had gone sideways.

Hannah spoke slowly but clearly. "Your employee insulted me. How do you plan to handle that?"

The manager drew in a breath. "He'll lose three months of commissions and bonuses."

Hannah let out a light laugh. "Still not enough."

"Then we'll terminate his employment immediately. Will that suffice?" the manager asked tentatively.

The moment the word "terminate" was mentioned, the sales assistant erupted. "You're really going to fire me? I'm your boyfriend! Who knows where these two women even got their money from-"

"Enough!" the manager snapped, signaling her subordinates to remove the sales assistant at once.

The manager apologized repeatedly. Hannah gestured toward Irene. "This lady was interested in a few bags.Please assist her."

"Of course, ma'am. Which would you like to see? I'll bring them over myself," the manager said to Irene, all smiles and eager to salvage the situation.

The mood ruined, Hannah and Rena exchanged a glance and quietly exited the store. Watching the two VIPs leave, the manager stood frozen, regret written all over her face. She'd just kissed a hefty amount of commission goodbye.

Irene made a prompt decision, selecting two limited-edition bags and footing the bill before leaving.

As Hannah and Rena strolled slowly through the mall, a voice called out behind them.

"Young lady!" Irene jogged up to Hannah.

Hannah greeted her politely. "Ma'am, is there something else you need?"

"This is for you," Irene said warmly, offering a wrapped handbag. "Thank you for what you did earlier."

Hannah shook her head. "I didn't do much. I really can't accept it."

Rena chimed in to help politely decline the gift. Irene, though disappointed, respected their decision and relented. Then, as if something occurred to her, she asked, "I heard you run a company. My son's also in business. Could I have your card? Maybe you two could have some business dealings."

"Of course," Hannah replied, retrieving a card from her bag and handing it over.

Irene took a moment to memorize the name on it before carefully putting it away.

Just then, a familiar voice called out, "Mom, what are you doing?"

They turned to see Miles approaching.

Hannah blinked in surprise, looking from Irene to Miles. This woman was his mother? What were the odds?
###Chapter 193 It Looked Like They Were On A Date


Miles hadn't anticipated crossing paths with Hannah here, of all places. He'd only heard bits and pieces about her recent ordeals.

Irene warmly called Miles over and said to Hannah with a bright smile, "This is my son-he's just tagging along while I shop."

Hannah met her gaze, offering a composed, cordial smile. "We're already familiar with each other."

Irene glanced at Miles, her eyes brimming with silent questions.

Miles nodded slightly, his tone neutral. "Our companies have worked together before."

A subtle glint sparked in Irene's eyes, as if a plan had just occurred to her."Well, then, you two must have plenty to catch up on. I'll give you some space."

With that, she gently steered Rena away.

Rena caught the hint immediately. She leaned closer, lowering her voice. "Mrs. Whitaker, are you matchmaking my best friend with your son?"

Irene let out a soft laugh, a faint blush rising in her cheeks. "Was I really that obvious? I can't help it-l just have a soft spot for her. She has the kind of energy I really admire."

Rena kept her thoughts to herself. Miles had a reputation for being icy and detached, his demeanor uncannily reminiscent of Hannah's ex-husband. In her eyes, Miles was hardly an ideal match for her friend.

But since Irene was determined to play cupid, Rena wasn't about to get involved. Whatever happened next would be up to Hannah and Miles.

As it turned out, Hannah actually had business to discuss with Miles, and this unexpected run-in saved her the trouble of seeking him out.

Spotting a cozy café just across the way, the two slipped inside and found a quiet tabe by the window. Miles broke the silence first. "I heard about the mess with Daphne at your company. Rest assured-she won't be causing any more trouble again."

"Glad to know," Hannah replied, pausing to take a careful sip of her coffee. She set her cup down and met his gaze, her tone shifting. "But that isn't what I wanted to discuss. Have you seen the latest news about Polaris Tech?"

Miles gave a slight nod. "I caught some headlines, but I haven't really kept up with the details."

Hannah slid her phone across the table. "See for yourself."

Miles scrolled through the files she'd pulled up, his brows lifting as the pieces fell into place. "You've got a whole dossier on Polaris Tech. Are you trying to buy them out?"
A faint smile tugged at Hannah's lips. "That's the plan. I did a bit of digging-turns out Brinley's been busy poaching game developers. I want to acquire Polaris Tech and use it as Nova Tech's entry into gaming."

He handed her phone back, his gaze steady. "Nova Tech will handle the acquisition. Why loop me in?"

Hannah's tone was frank, her posture relaxed but resolute. "Polaris Tech is supported by the Jones Group.Given my history with Vincent, neither Felix nor l is the right person to make contact."

She had no intention of letting Vincent know her plan.

"So this really comes back to Mr. Jones." He hesitated and then asked, "Why tap me?"

Hannah met his eyes without flinching. "We've worked well together twice now. That's reason enough for me." She straightened, giving him space to consider. "You don't have to answer now, Mr. Whitaker. Just think about it."

Miles responded without a moment's pause, "No need."

Hannah had braced herself for rejection, and she wasn't too deflated by his response. "Understood, Mr.Whitaker." Her polite smile stayed firmly in place.

Noting she had gotten the wrong idea, Miles, corrected her, his tone dry."1meant there's no need to consider it. I'm in."
The corners of Hannah's mouth lifted, her eyes warming as she raised her coffee cup to clink his. "I'm certain we'll work well together."

Miles held her gaze, impassive as ever. "I'm not doing this for you. I just see promise in the gaming market."

Hannah gave a quick nod. "Absolutely. I know you care about profit."

They hashed out the basic split of shares and ironed out the initial logistics-enough to get the ball rolling.All that remained was to put it all into writing.

Hannah had braced herself for pushback but found none. Surprisingly, the negotiations went off without a hitch. She couldn't resist commenting, "You know, you're a lot easier to work with than you used to be, Mr.Whitaker."

Miles paused, sipping his coffee, his expression unreadable. "Was I really that difficult before?"

She grinned, not holding back. "Difficult? You were impossible. Getting you to agree to anything was like chasing the wind."

He gave her a sidelong look, all business again."Our legal teams can sort out the paperwork. If that's all, I'll get going."

She raised her hand in a friendly wave, her smile bright. "Have a nice day, Mr. Whitaker."

Rena had wandered off,bored of waiting.

Irene, meanwhile, had been watching the scene unfold from across the way. As soon as Miles stepped out of the café, she swooped in, a hint of curiosity in her voice. "You two looked pretty deep in conversation. Are you and Ms. Scott close?"

"Mom, Ms. Scott and I are not close," Miles answered, his tone clipped as he kept walking.

Irene kept pace with him, a smile brightening her face.′′Come on, don't try to fool me. I saw you smile at her."

"I didn't," he shot back, brushing off her question without missing a step. "Done shopping? Let's go home." Irene simply smiled to herself, unbothered by his evasiveness-if anything, her son's reaction only made her
more intrigued.

Across the room, Erica sat by the window, sipping her coffee and catching every nuance of the exchange between Hannah and Miles. Her gaze narrowed as a plan took root. Without hesitation, she picked up her phone and quickly typed out a message to Vincent."Vincent, how do Hannah and Miles know each other?From where I'm sitting, it honestly looks like they're on a date."
###Chapter 194 You Into Hannah Now


While finalizing details for the Bluebay Shores development project, Vincent received a message. The word "date" leapt out at him, snagging his focus like a burr. His gaze sharpened.

Checking his watch, he realized the meeting had dragged on for less than half an hour. This sort of meeting was hardly worth his time, but he'd insisted on attending anyway. Staying busy was the only thing that kept his mind from spiraling.

The next stretch of days blurred by in a storm of meetings and flights. He even flew abroad to track down a top defense attorney for Brinley, bargaining for a lighter sentence on her behalf.

When Brinley asked to see him, he refused outright. He wouldn't let himself waver again.

As soon as word reached him that Miles was making moves to acquire Polaris Tech, Vincent didn't hesitate-he went down to the company himself.

Jones Group had no intention of letting Polaris Tech slip away. In fact, Erica had been relentless lately,throwing her full weight behind the plan to wrest control. Vincent hadn't agreed.

Vincent met Miles at Polaris headquarters, cutting straight through the pleasantries. "What's suddenly got you so eager to buy Polaris Tech?"

The air between them was always brisk, never clouded by manipulation or false fronts. Miles didn't bother to hide anything. "This started because of Hannah," he answered with his usual bluntness. "She pitched me on a partnership. Plus, I see real potential in gaming, so l agreed."

Vincent's eyes narrowed. He picked up on the real game immediately.′′She asked you to step in so l wouldn't find out?"

Miles replied with a nod, cool and unapologetic, "That's right."

"Got it." Vincent's expression shuttered, impossible to read. Without a flicker of hesitation, he made up his mind. "Polaris Tech is yours for half its market price."
Miles arched an eyebrow in surprise. The deal was falling into his lap, but the undercurrent was obvious.
"Funny. For someone who claims not to care about Hannah, you've certainly gone above and beyond for her."

Miles had noticed it. From funneling ten million into Hannah's company to unloading Polaris Tech at a loss,every move pointed back to her.

Vincent's stare turned ice-cold. "Whatever I do for Hannah is none of your concern."

Catching the warning in his tone, Miles let it go. The paperwork was signed and sealed in record time.

As Miles started to leave the conference room, Vincent's voice stopped him, quiet but with a bite beneath the politeness. "Hold on. I hear you've been... going on blind dates with my ex-wife recently?"

There it was, plain as day. Miles almost denied it, but after catching the look in Vincent's eyes, he went against the truth instead. "Indeed, Mr.Jones."

Miles made it sound casual, but the answer was deliberate-he wanted to see what Vincent would do with it.

A crease formed between Vincent's brows. "Thought you couldn't stand blind dates."

"I can't," Miles said, his mouth twitching with a wry smile. "But when my mom sets them up, I'm not exactly in a position to refuse."

Vincent's gaze turned even more unreadable. "So? You into Hannah now?"

Miles just lifted a brow, voice steady as ever. "Not at the moment."

Vincent didn't have the nerve to ask Hannah what she was thinking. The longer he brooded over it, the more the tension seemed to coil in his chest.

Vincent eventually let Miles go and lingered in the empty conference room, sinking into silence as the hours crawled by.

That evening, Vincent returned to the Jones family estate to find Danica perched on the sofa, a thick photo album open across her lap. She beckoned him over with a bright wave. "Vincent, come take a look at this."
The album wasn't just glossy portraits-each page was crowded with/names, family trees, and carefully typed phone numbers.

Danica tapped on a particular page, her eyes shining with hope."Here-what do you think of this lady?"

His jaw tightened as he eyed the page."What is this supposed to be?"

Danica gave a small, knowing smile. "I know you're not going to love this. But it's been a while since the divorce. You can't stay single forever, Vincent. After everything that happened with Brinley... It's time to settle down." She figured that maybe if he remarried, the endless gossip among the socialites would finally die down.

Now, thinking back to that ill-fated birthday party-introducing Brinley as his fiancée-Danica winced inwardly. The scandal made her the joke of their group, with people saying she couldn't spot a gold digger from a criminal. Desperate to salvage her reputation, she threw herself into finding him a respectable match.

"I'm not interested," Vincent stated, his voice devoid of emotion.

"At least consider them. These women come from respectable families," Danica insisted.

He lingered over the album, flipping through a few pages without expression. "Alright. I'll take a look."

Danica's entire face brightened, relief flooding her voice. "That's all I ask! If anyone stands out, let me know."

He carried the album up to his room, the weight of it oddly heavy in his hands. Once the door clicked shut behind him, Vincent called Derek to track down Irene's number.

When Irene realized Vincent was on the other end of the line, her heart skipped.

"Mrs. Whitaker," Vincent began, his eyes still fixed on the album, his voice even but deliberate."Itseems you've been giving Miles a hand with his dating life recently."

He let the line hang for a momment and then continued,"Coincidentally, I might have a promising introduction for him. Would you be interested?"
###Chapter 195 I'm Not Interested In You


The core program for Nova Tech's Smart Wristband 4.0 was finally complete, awaiting only minor finishing touches.

As Polaris Tech's primary shareholder, Hannah swiftly initiated major reforms within the company. She placed emphasis on recruiting talented individuaIs with expertise in gaming, providing them significant creative freedom. Gradually, Polaris Tech regained its momentum, steadily getting back on track.

During this busy period, Hannah received an unexpected call from Irene.

"Hello, Hannah. It's Miles' mother," Irene warmly said.

"Hello, Mrs. Whitaker," Hannah politely replied.

"I'd like to invite you to dinner as thanks for your help the other day. Are you available tomorrow?" Irene extended the invitation.

Hannah instinctively declined. "There's really no need, Mrs. Whitaker. I didn't do much."

Irene insisted firmly, "I won't feel at ease until I've properly thanked you."

Irene's persistent sincerity made it impossible for Hannah to continue declining. Eventually, she conceded."Alright, Mrs. Whitaker. Tomorrow it is."

Delighted, Irene immediately ended the call and sent Miles a swift message. "Gilded Restaurant tomorrow-you must come."

Miles rubbed his temples as he read his mother's message. Recently, his life had become a whirlwind of blind dates, thanks to Vincent's maneuver. He couldn't help but silently grumble at Vincent's over-the-top retaliation, all sparked by a casual remark.

Miles texted back to his mother. "Who's it this time?"

Irene responded quickly, "What are you thinking? I'm thanking Ms. Scott tomorrow, not arranging another date for you!"

Miles breathed a sigh of relief and wrote. "Alright." As long as it wasn't another forced date, he was fine with whatever his mother planned.

Miles' rapid response amused Irene. She had noticed his various excuses whenever the topic of blind dates arose. After numerous failed attempts, she decided to give up on the list of potential matches provided by Vincent and discreetly shifted her matchmaking intentions toward Hannah.

Irene also messaged Daphne, inviting her to join them.

However, Daphne, recalling Miles' previous.annoyed reaction when she introduced a friend of hers to him,politely declined, and Irene didn't push further.

The following day, Irene arrived early at Gilded Restaurant to ensure everything was perfect and ordered their meal.

Hannah and Miles arrived almost simultaneously.

Spotting Hannah, Miles immediately understood why his mother had been so insistent that he leave precisely at ten. Clearly, she hoped they would "coincidentally" run into each other. He sighed inwardly.

Elegantly dressed in a lake-blue dress, Hannah greeted Miles naturally, "Mr. Whitaker." She wasn't surprised. Irene had informed her that Miles would aIso be present.

Walking alongside Miles, Hannah naturally engaged him in a professional conversation.

Vincent had just parked his car when he spotted the two walking side by side. His expression darkened subtly as he stepped out of his car, calling out, "Mr. Whitaker!"

Both Hannah and Miles turned around.

Approaching them calmly, Vincent spoke to Miles, though his eyes fixed on Hannah. "What a coincidence."

"Mr. Jones, what brings you here?" Miles asked, recalling the blind date list Vincent had given to his mother.Feeling mischievous, he leaned toward Hannah, making it look like he placed his hand around Hannah's waist while he didn't. Vincent's gaze sharpened at Miles' subtle action. "Business meeting," he replied curtly.

Miles swiftly added, "We're here to have dinner with my mother."

Hannah glanced at her watch and gently reminded, "We should hurry. We shouldn't keep your mother waiting."

"Of course." Miles agreed. "Excuse us, Mr. Jones."

Vincent watched the pair leave together, his expression inscrutable. Was Miles now introducing Hannah to his family?

Inside the elevator, Miles cast a thoughtful look at Hannah.

Feeling his gaze, Hannah asked uneasily, "Is there something on my face?"

"You seem rather distant with Mr. Jones," Miles remarked straightforwardly.

Hannah smiled faintly, responding lightly, "Have you ever seen former spouses who were particularly friendly?"

Miles withdrew his gaze, apologizing softly, "Sorry for earlier. That gesture was inappropriate."

Hannah understood what he meant and responded graciously,"It's fine. You didn't actually touch me."

"Aren't you curious?" Miles prompted.

Of course, Hannah was curious about the tension between Miles and Vincent, but she maintained a neutral face,shaking her head calmly. "Not particularly."

Miles,however, felt compelled to explain. "Vincent recently flooded my mother with blind date profiles."

Hannah couldn't immediately see how that related to her.

Just then, the elevator chimed open, and Miles stepped out first, adding quickly, "Don't get the wrong idea -I'm not interested in you."

Hannah blinked, slightly confused. Her mind hadn't even wandered that way.Once they entered the private dining room, Irene greeted them joyfully, seating Hannah and Miles side by side.

As the dishes arrived, Irene engaged Hannah warmly in conversation. Suddenly, aknock at the door interrupted them.

Miles, assuming more dishes had arrived, opened the door casually, only to be met by Vincent, bottle of red wine in hand, smiling cheerfully as he greeted, "Irene!"
###Chapter 196 Come See My Brother's Future Bride


For a moment, Hannah stiffened, caught off guard.

Vincent stepped past Miles, entering the room with a confident air as he addressed Irene, "I heard you were hosting a dinner, Mrs. Whitaker, so I brought a bottle of wine as a little gift."

Vincent's gaze swept over the seating arrangement. The moment he saw Hannah sitting next to Miles,every question he had vanished-Miles really was introducing Hannah to his mother.

Suddenly,Vincent felt the bottle in his hand seemed to burn wvith heat.

Miles accepted the wine smoothly, not missing a beat. "This is such a fine wine. Thanks, Mr. Jones. We'll be sure to enjoy it."

Irene offered a warm, welcoming smile."How considerate of you, Mr. Jones. Why not stay and join us for dinner?"

This time,Hannah found her voice.′′Ms.Whitaker, I'm sure Mr. Jones has a packed schedule. Let's not keep him."

Vincent replied with practiced ease, "Actually, I had a meeting scheduled, but it was canceled at the last minute."

Irene immediately cleared a spot at the table. "That works out perfectly. Please, Mr. Jones, have a seat."

Vincent pretended to hesitate. "Are you sure? I really don't want to intrude."After a few polite back-and-forths, Vincent finally agreed. "Well, if you insist."

He chose the seat directly across from Hannah.

Hannah didn't object since this dnner was hosted by Irene. Still, any desire to enjoy the dishes disappeared in an instanf. All she wanted was for the meal to end as soon as possible. Noticing her change in demeanor, Miles leaned closer. "Are you alright? You seem a bit off."

Hannah forced a quick smile and brushed off his concern. No way she could say, "I'm only uncomfortable because my ex-husband just sat down across from me."

Vincent noticed the quiet exchange between the two and couldn't help himself. "Since when did you two become so close, Mr.Whitaker?"

Miles responded calmly, "Working together brings people closer. We've partnered a few times-it adds up over time."

That was the truth. It was the same way Miles had cometo be on friendly terms with Vincent.

Irene glanced between them, her curiosity piqued. "Wait a minute, Mr. Jones, you're saying you already know Ms.Scott?"

With an easy motion, Vincent raised his wineglass, took a measured sip, and fixed his eyes on Hannah."Absolutely. She's my ex-wife."

Hannah's expression didn't change at all.

Shock was written all over Irene's face as her mouth dropped open.

Anyone younger or more active online would have known the story of Hannah and Vincent's past. Irene,however, rarely went near the internet and had no clue there was any connection between them.

Irene tried to cover her surprise. "Oh my. Here I am, making things awkward. Let's eat, shall we? I hope you all enjoy the meal."

For a moment, everyone grew quiet, and the group started eating in uneasy silence.

Just then, the door to the private room swung open.

Daphne entered with a bright smile. "Mom! I happened to be here with some friends, so I thought I'd come see the woman you're hoping will be my brother's future bride..."

Her words left the room frozen. The second Daphne spotted Hannah, her face changed. "Hannah Scott? What are you doing here?"

Irene was quick to step in, gently pulling Daphne aside. "Hannah is here as my guest."

Daphne froze, her eyes wide. "Wait, Mom, is she really the one you've been trying to set my brother up with?"

Hearing this, Vincent tossed back the last of his wine in a single swallow, his jaw set.

Irene hurried to press a hand over Daphne's mouth. "Careful with your words."

Turning to Hannah and Vincent, Irene offered an uneasy smile, clearly trying to keep the peace.

Daphne quickly pulled her mother's hand away. "Why are you stopping me from speaking, Mom?" Raising her voice, she added, "I don't care who you choose, but it can't be Hannah. She's not a good person!"

Irene gave her daughter's arm a sharp tug. "That's enough-I never meant it that way."

Daphne refused to back down and spoke even louder. "Don't ie to me. This whole dinner was meant to set her up with my brother. And I'm telling you now-she's not worthy of my brother. She's divorced, for crying out loud! You honestly believe someone like her fits into our family?"

Hannah didn't flinch. She'd heard worse before-and plenty of it.

Miles finally lost his patience. "Daphne. That's enough. Apologize to Ms. Scott."

Daphne's eyes filled with angry tears. "No. Why does everyone keep taking her side over mine?"

Miles let out a sigh. "We've spoiled you for far too long."

Daphne's lips began to tremble, and her eyes grew red with frustration.

Whatever good mood the group had was long gone. The dinner had completely unraveled, and no one tried to hide their discomfort anymore. Hannah decided she'd had enough, picked up her bag,and got to her feet to leave.

The sight of Hannah walking away pushed Daphne over the edge. In a burst of anger, she grabbed a glass and hurled it at Hannah's back. "Here's to your shamelessness in seducing my brother!"But the glass never even got close to Hannah. It struck Vincent, who had leapt forward to shield the attack,right on the forehead with a dull thud. He winced, caught Daphne's wrist before she could react, and fixed her with a cold stare. "Really? Is this what your family thinks is acceptable behavior?"
###Chapter 197 Can't You Stop Going On Dates With Other People


Under Vincent's forceful grip, Daphne cried out in pain, pleading for help from her brother and mother.

Miles, however, didn't intervene. He believed his sister needed this lesson. "We should've taught her better manners," he said to Vincent.

Irene felt distressed watching her daughter suffer, but knew deep down Daphne was in the wrong. Resorting to violence was unacceptable.

Hannah had been on her way out when she heard the thud. She turned to find Vincent with a visible red mark on his forehead.

Hannah's face clouded over. Daphne's hostility toward her wasn't new. She approached, gently freed Daphne's wrist from Vincent's grip, and waved her own hand in front of Daphne's eyes.

Nursing her sore wrist, Daphne snapped, "What are you doing?"

"Oh, so you can see after all," Hannah remarked, lips briefly curving upward before turning ice-cold."If you can see, why are you blind to the truth?"

"Are you insulting me now?" Daphne retorted loudly.

"No, just giving you a necessary lesson," Hannah replied without hesitation."Use your judgment instead of blindly trusting others. How foolish of you to buy whatever Brinley tells you. You're an adult-maybe start using your brain!"

Daphne stubbornly pouted. "Stop trying to drive a wedge between me and Brinley. She's nothing like you."

"Indeed, she's different from me." Hannah raised an eyebrow. "After all, she's currently serving time overseas.I certainly can't match her."

"What?" Daphne froze in shock. Brinley hadn't been reachable for days. Though online rumors about Brinley had surfaced, she'd dismissed them and even defended Brinley.
"You're lying," Daphne instinctively fired back.

"Brinley is in prison. Check it yourself if you doubt me,"Hannah stated plainly. "And one more thing-I put Brinley there myself. If you'd like to experience prison life personally, keep spreading slander. I'm quite familiar with the legal process."

Hannah's mocking smile intensified as she picked up a glass of red wine, splashing it unceremoniously onto Daphne's face. "Keep your apologies. Consider this drink a lesson for your reckless mouth," she said coldly turning sharply and striding away with Vincent following closely behind.

Daphne wiped her face furiously, turning to Miles, tears welling in her eyes. "Miles, why didn't you help me when Hannah humiliated me?"

Miles pinched the bridge of his nose, exasperation evident. "Haven't you caused enough trouble already?"

Irene sighed deeply, genuinely disheartened by the meal's unpleasant end. She liked Hannah, who had barely eaten anything before leaving.



Hannah reached the parking lot.

Vincent caught up swiftly, blocking her path to the driver's side. "Gunter Kirby is dead-beaten by loan sharks," he said.

"Oh." Hannah lowered her gaze, considering that scum deserved it.

She attempted to open the car door, but Vincent stubbornly remained in her way.

Frustration evident, Hannah sighed. "You've said your piece. Let me leave."

Vincent pressed on. "You hardly ate anything. How about we visit your favorite restaurant? They've got a new truffle foie gras dish.Interested?"

"Move!" Hannah replied curtly. "I have no interestin dining with my ex-husband."

Noticing her eagerness to escape, Vincent's irritation flared slightly. "You'd gladly have dinner with a date

Date? Hannah paused briefly, realizing Daphne's careless remarks had led to a misunderstanding.Without bothering to clarify, she calmly responded, "Ten minutes? Two years ago, I called you twenty-nine times while hemorrhaging. Where were my ten minutes then?"

Vincent's pupils shrank, visibly shaken. "What hemorrhage?"

"Don't act concerned now." Hannah scoffed bitterly.""It's far too late." Her eyes were cold with indifference as she uttered those final words.

Vincent's voice softened, complicated emotions evident."I'm sorry."

"If you truly mean it, step aside," Hannah stated firmly, attempting to push past him again.

Vincent remained unmoving. Unwilling to continue arguing, Hannah turned around sharply, heading back toward the restaurant. If he was determined to block her car door, he could stand there all night!

But Vincent quickly followed.

Suddenly, a black car raced wildly toward Hannah.

Before she could react, strongarms pulled her forcefully aside.

They crashed heavily onto the ground, the speeding vehicle narrowly missing them.

Shaken, Hannah tried to rise, but Vincent's grip tightened around her. "Don't move-it hurts," he murmured.

Uncomfortable with their proximity, Hannah struggled, but VVincent pulled her closer, leaving their faces mere inches apart.

Anger flickered in her eyes, but Vincent spoke first, his voice muffled and vulnerable."Can't you stop going on dates with other people?"
###Chapter 198 We Were Married Once


Hannah wasted no time pulling herself free from Vincent's hold and getting to her feet. "This is my life. You don't get to tell me what to do."

On the ground, Vincent let out a small groan. "I... I don't think I can stand up right now."

She moved aside, folding her arms, her tone cool. "Spare me your act." For someone who worked out as much as he did, he should have been sturdy enough to get up on his own.

"I'm not faking," Vincent said as beads of sweat started forming on his forehead. "Lend me a hand, will you?"

He extended his arm, hoping she'd pull him up.

She paused, considering, but instead of grabbing his hand, she stepped behind him and gave him a solid shove upward. The scrape on his back was already bleeding, his shirt torn and stained red. Her brow knit in irritation. "I could've avoided that car myself."

Vincent turned and met her eyes. "There was no time to think. I couldn't risk it."

Her gaze grew stern.

A faint smile flickered on his lips. "Were you scared something might happen to me?"

Hannah frowned.""Don't fool yourself."

"It's nothing serious. Just a few scrapes and bruises," he said casually, though he never took his eyes off her.

"You should get checked out at the hospital,"she said, her patience running thin.

He took a cautious step toward her. "How about you take me there?" He let out another groan, a little dramatic. She immediately backed away, her face full of annoyance. "Your legs work just fine. Why should I be the one to take you? I've got things to do."

His voice dropped, sounding almost hurt. "It really hurts. I can't drive like this." After a beat, he added quietly, "We were married once, you know..."

So he was going to play the sympathy card now? Her expression turned cold. "Don't try to guilt me. There's nothing between us anymore."

Vincent fell silent, caught off guard.

Without another word, Hannah spun on her heel and headed for her car. Vincent was quicker, cutting her off and planting himself right in front of the driver's door. "You seriously won't even give me a ride to the hospital?" His frustration was impossible to miss.

From a hidden spot nearby, Erica watched the whole scene unfold. She had already parked the black car some distance away before returning here.

Originally, she'd tailed Vincent here, hoping to stage a "coincidental" meeting and maybe spark a conversation. Yet, the last thing she'd expected was to spot him with Hannah.

Jealousy had struck so fast that it drowned out every rational thought. Acting on impulse, she'd jumped into a random black car, slammed on the gas, and sped straight toward Hannah. If Vincent hadn't pulled Hannah back at the last second, Hannah might not have survived.

Hatred flashed in Erica's eyes for just a second. By the time she approached them, her expression had changed to one of calculated innocence. Putting on her best act, she smiled as if it were nothing more than an accidental encounter. "Vincent? Ms. Scott? You two had dinner here too?"

Erica's gaze landed on the cut above Vincent's eyebrow, and she gasped, voice full of real concern. "What happened to you? Why did you get hurt?"

Vincent turned away, refusing to meet her eyes. "It's nothing."

Hannah seized the opportunity. "Well, your timing is perfect." She gave Vincent a determined shove in Erica's direction. "He's got a bad scrape on his back. You should get him to the hospital." Vincent didn't move an inch, his attention still fixed on Hannah.

But Hannah had already climbed into her car and pulled away, never once glancing back.

Erica noticed the direction of his gaze and frowned. "Honestly, what is it with you? Every time she's around,you get yourself hurt. If your grandmother hears about this, she'll be heartbroken."

After a pause, she finally voiced what had been on her mind all along, "You really need to stop seeing Hannah. You two are divorced. It's time you moved on."

He barely looked at her. "I know what I am doing." With that, he headed straight for his own car.

Erica reached for his keys, hoping to convince him. "Let me do the driving."

"There's no need.It's not serious." He slid behind the wheel, shutting the door before she could stop him.

She made a move toward the passenger side, but the car was already pulling away. He hadn't even thought about waiting for her.

Erica called after him more than once, but he ignored her completely. She stood alone, watching as he disappeared down the road, her expression growing troubled.

Worried, she decided to drive to the hospital just in case he showed up there. But when she arrived, he was nowhere to be found.

After asking a few questions, she learned that Vincent hadn't come to the hospital for treatment at all-he had gone straight back to his office. Unsure what else to do, she picked up some ointment from the pharmacy and headed over to his workplace.

Vincent, meanwhile, was buried in paperwork. He had done a quick job of tending to his wounds and switched into a fresh shirt.

When his secretary informed him that a wwoman was waiting in reception with medical supplies, his first thought was-Hannah.But as soon as he walked in and saw the figure waiting, it wasn't her.
###Chapter 199 She's Dead


With his lips drawn in a tight line, Vincent walked into the room, his face icy. "Is there something you needed?"

Erica placed a collection of medical supplies on the desk. "Take your shirt off. I picked up some medication from the hospital."

Vincent remained still, making no move to comply.

She softened her tone. "Come on. Don't be shy. Let me treat those wounds."

He simply reached for the ointments and bandages. "I'll handle it myself."

Her brow furrowed as she tried again. "You can't even see your own back. How are you going to manage?"

He didn't respond, keeping his focus on the supplies.

Knowing how stubborn he was, Erica decided to let it go. If she pushed any further, it would only make things more awkward. She offered a few quick instructions on how to use the ointment and then turned to leave the room.

Just before stepping into the elevator, she paused, pretending to scan around. That was when she overheard Vincent quietly telling someone to investigate the black car involved in the attempt on Hannah's life in the parking lot.

She tucked away that bit of information and then slipped into the elevator. It was clear to her that the car needed to disappear-and quick<ly.

···

On the other side of town, Hannah's life was slowly getting back on track. She had finally put together the version 4.0 prototype of her wristband and was one of the first to give it a try

At Polaris Tech, a brand new gaming division had been launched, and development was aready in the early stages.

That evening, Hannah was on her usual drive home from work when she spotted something suspicious in her rearview mirror-a car was tailing her.

Her expression hardened. Without a second thought, she removed Vincent's number from her blocklist and gave him a call. Her tone was anything but friendly.′′Ae you having me followed again? If you are, the least you could do is give me a heads-up."

Vincent's voice took on a serious note. "I didn't send anyone to follow you."

The answer caught her off guard."What?" Her heart skipped a beat. So, who was trailing her now?

Vincent interjected, "Try not to panic. I'l get someone to look into it-"

But before he could finish, the line suddenly went dead.

Vincent acted on instinct, sending a team out right away to protect Hannah.

But Hannah hadn't been the one to hang up. Her call had been hijacked. Someone had jammed the signal and forcefully cut the connection.

When she tried to slow the car, she realized the brakes weren't working. Her eyes flicked to the rearview mirror, and a jolt of fear shot through her. A figure was emerging from the trunk-a man dressed all in black,his twisted grin enough to freeze her blood. He moved toward her with eerie calm, like something out of a nightmare.

Without giving herself away, Hannah pressed the button on her wristband. The new model did more than just send her live location to her emergency contacts-'it alerted the police directly.

Her voice came out even, steady despite the terror pulsing through her veins. "Who sent you?"

The man leaned closer, pressing a blade to her throat. "Fifty million bought your head," he replied, eyes cold.

Not a muscle in her face moved. "I'll pay you a hundred million.Just walk away." He sneered, "Nice try. But people in my business don't break contracts.",

She felt the knife nick her skin, leaving a thin line of blood behind. He added, "Still, for the right price, I could leave your body in one piece."

"So much for bargaining," she said, mind racing for any way out. The steering wheel beneath her hands was her last shot.

She acted before he could react. With a sharp stomp, she floored the gas pedal. The man yelled in panic,"What are you doing?"

Her jaw clenched. "Saving myself. Isn't it obvious?"

Eyes flashing, Hannah yanked the wheel hard to the side, aiming for the guardrail.

"You're out of your mind!" His terrified scream was swallowed up by the sound of metal smashing and glass shattering.

The car rolled violently.

The man in black crashed into the seat, knocked out by the force of the impact.

Airbags burst around Hannah. Her head spun, but she clawed for consciousness, fighting to unbuckle herself and crawl out of the car through the jagged opening.

Glass ripped at her skin, but she barely noticed. It felt like freedom was finally within reach. But then, as she staggered upright, reality crashed in-her ordeal wasn't over yet.

A row of men dressed in black suits stood silently outside the smoldering wreck.

Darkness crept into Hannah's vision, and her body collapsed to the ground.

Without hesitation, those men advanced, dragged a woman's lifeless body over, and dumped it inside the crushed remains of the car.

One of them instructed coldly, "Burn it all."

The others answered at once, "Understood." Each man flicked open a lighter and tossed it onto the wreck. In seconds, a heavy whoosh filled the air as fire swallowed up the vehicle.

Someone tore the wristband from Hannah's arm and threw it down by the burning metal.

In an instant, they all climbed into a waiting black van and sped off into the darkness.

When the police finally arrived, the flames had mostly died down. All that was left was the blackened shell of the car.

Meanwhile, back at the office, Vincent found himself unable to focus. Every paper on his desk became a blur as he stared at his phone, checking the,screen over and over.

Suddenly, a bright flash caught his eye."DANGER ALERT" appeared across the display.

He shot out of his chair. Right then, his bodyguard called. He grabbed the phone in an instant. "Did you find anything? Who did this?"

A grim voice came through. "Not yet. Those people knew exactly what they were doing. This was no amateur attack. It'll take some time to find out who's behind it."

Vincent's voice was tight. "What about Hannah? Did she make it home safely?"

There was a pause on the line. The guard's tone grew cautious. "Mr. Jones... Ms.Scott...She-"

Vincent had a sinking feeling. "Tell me. What happened?"

"She's dead."

The words slammed into Vincent."What are you saying?" he barked, breath coming in short bursts.

"I'm on-site," the guard replied. "The police have confirmed that nobody inside made it out alive. The license plate-it was hers." ###Chapter 200 Disrupting The Funeral


Vincent refused to accept it. "Where?" he asked, his voice sharp.

When the bodyguard gave Vincent the address, Vincent checked the GPS on his phone. The locations matched perfectly, and a wave of disbelief nearly knocked him off balance.

Without thinking, he rushed out and jumped into his car, speeding away without another thought.

Pushing the accelerator to the limit, Vincent·reached the scene in under ten minutes.

The site was a mess, with people crowding around to see what had happened.

Police had already roped off the area, and the flames from the wrecked car had been put out.

Shaking, Vincent forced his way past the tape, desperate to get closer.

A police officer moved to block him, but his bodyguard quickly stepped in. "Please let us through. Mr.Jones' wife is involved in the accident."

The officer paused for a moment before reluctantly allowing them access.

Vincent collapsed beside the burnt-out car, his eyes locking onto a forensic investigator who was holding up a license plate inside a clear evidence bag. He recognized it instantly-it belonged to Hannah. She had just been talking to him.How could she be gone so fast?

Still clinging to hope, Vincent grabbed an officer's arm. "Is she really gone?"

A hand landed on his shoulder as the officer replied, "I'm sorry for your loss. The body was completely burned.Only fragments and some bone remain."

Vincent shook his head, unable to believe it. He staggered as he stood up, and his bodyguards had to steady him-still, he couldn't accept what he was hearing.

Every trace of his usual calm had vanished. One of his bodyguards, hands trembling, held something out to him. "Mr. Jones, this is the only thing we found that belonged to your wife."

Vincent stared at the wristband the bodyguard offered. Tears welled up in his eyes, blurring his view until the wristband in the bodyguard's palm was nearly impossible to see.

With shaking hands, Vincent reached out and took the wristband. It was unmistakably Hannah's. Even though he still didn't want to believe it, there was no denying that tragedy had struck Hannah. This time, he knew deep down he had truly lost her.

The horror of that realization drained all color from Vincent's face. He pressed a hand to his chest as a cough wracked his body, blood splattering onto his shirt. His knees buckled, and he seemed ready to collapse.

The bodyguards hovered nearby, worry etched on their faces.

Vincent wiped away the blood with the back of his hand and then gently brushed the dust from the wristband before fastening it around his wrist.

Barely able to keep himself standing, Vincent delivered his orders, each word heavy with meaning."Whatever it takes, track down whoever did this. I want them to suffer for what they've done."

The bodyguards replied as one, "Understood."

Close by, a police officer looked on and shook his head. With a body burned beyond recognition and the scene conveniently left without camera coverage, there were no easy answers. Even the police found themselves at a loss.

Not long after, Hannah's family received the official notification of her death.

The shock sent Raymond and Margaret into a spiral of grief and illness. Felix hurried to the hospital to help care for them, refusing to accept that Hannah was truly gone. He kept messaging her, clinging to the hope that she would respond.

When Miles heard what had happened, confusion and sorrow took hold. He spent three days in mourning,dressed in black for Hannah. Erica soon learned about Hannah's death. She hadn't expected her fifty million on hiring the professional assassin to be this well-spent. Even more surprising was the news that two lives had been lost in the wreck,meaning the assassin had died along with Hannah in the flames. That meant there was no chance it could be traced back to her. She had managed to get rid of Hannah without any complications.

Erica felt a rush of satisfaction.

Vincent chose not to share the news of Hannah's death with anyone from the Jones family, and Erica made sure to stay silent, not wanting to stir up trouble.

The police reached a dead end in their investigation and eventually issued an official report confirming Hannah's death. After discussing things with Margaret, Raymond decided to keep the funeral simple for their daughter, then planned to return home and never come back to this painful place.

Hannah's parents organized a quiet service, inviting only a handful of close friends and business partners.

Rena, Felix, and Miles all struggled to hold back their tears.

Without any warning, Vincent arrived at the funeral, throwing everything into chaos. He refused to let the ceremony go on.

Tears streaming down her face, Margaret struck Vincent with trembling hands. "How could you be so cruel?My daughter is gone, and you still won't leave her be! You bastard, get out of here!"

Raymond tried to hold off Vincent's bodyguards, who seemed unwilling to use force against him and restrained themselves.

Vincent stayed silent through the chaos. Spotting Hannah's portrait at the front, he marched over and ripped it down. "If anyone dares to hold a funeral for Hannah, I'll destroy it every single time."

Rena couldn't hold back her outrage. "Vincent, have you lost your mind? Did you not care about Hannah at all? How can you do this to her now?"

Felix held her back. "Leave him be. His heart has always been frozen."

Miles studied Vincent with a thoughtful frown. From what he knew of Vincent, Vincent might have uncovered something that the rest of them hadn't to behave like this. Was it possible that Hannah was still alive?
###Chapter 201 How Does It Feel To Lose Someone Precious


The funeral was irreparably ruined.

Vincent didn't spare a glance for anyone as he stormed out. He left a small team behind, ostensibly to keep an eye on things.

Margaret and Raymond sank to their knees, sobbing uncontrollably, while Rena and Felix, their eyes swollen and red, struggled to console them.

Miles hesitated briefly before following Vincent out. "Vincent," he called out. "Hannah isn't really dead, is she?"

Vincent paused, fingers brushing the wristband on his wrist, and gave a bitter smile. "No one wishes she were still alive more than I do."

He would trade his own life for hers without hesitation. The mere thought of losing her was suffocating.

Miles frowned slightly. "Then why disrupt the funeral? Wouldn't you want Hannah to rest peacefully?"

"Because I felt like it." He loathed funerals. Those mournful colors were nothing but a painful reminder of Hannah's death. He despised them to such an extent that he couldn't help but tear it all down.

Without another word, Vincent continued walking away.

If anyone had paid attention, they'd notice that Vincent hadn't slept more than a total of three hours over the past few days. Each night, he'd drive to the spot of Hannah's accident, pacing restlessly until dawn.Then, he'd head straight back to the company, putting on a facade of normalcy, though his body was already nearing its breaking point.

The investigators he'd dispatched returned empty-handed. His complexion deteriorated by the day.

Derek, who had been following Vincent closely, grew increasingly worried. He even suggested Vincent drown his sorrow with large amounts of alcohol, hoping to numb his pain. But Vincent adamantly refused, saying only pain made him feel alive.

Derek knew Vincent was punishing himself. No amount of persuasion could change his mind.

Erica observed silently from the sidelines, knowing that interfering now would only make things worse. She believed time would eventually fade Hannah's memory from Vincent's mind.


***

One evening, while working late, Vincent received an anonymous email.

The sender provided no name-just a few provocative lines: "How does it feel to lose someone precious?The mighty CEO of Jones Group, brought low in anguish-when was the last time you felt this on edge?Watching you suffer has become my nightly entertainment."

Vincent immediately knew someone was spying on him. He typed quickly. "Who the hell are you?"

A prompt response arrived. "You must miss her terribly."

Vincent's hands trembled as he wrote. "Is she with you?"

Instead of another text, the sender forwarded a video.

Vincent opened it, and his eyes instantly filled with tears. It showed Hannah asleep, and he watched it dozens of times just to confirm she was indeed breathing.

Regaining composure, he sent another message."What do you want?"

The reply was chillingly clear. "Come to Riley Island alone-no bodyguards. Otherwise, you know exactly what will happen. Your wife is quite attractive. Cross me, and I'll have my fair share of fun with her before putting a bullet in her damn head."

Vincent's jaw clenched in rage. As he tried sending his response, it bounced back, undelivered.

He immediately summoned a hacker to track the email's IP, only to find it originated from a virtual,untraceable account. Clearly, he was the target. From the threatening tone, the culprit was obviously an enemy. He thoughtfully touched the wristband, formulating a strategy.

Vincent sent the wristband to Felix, instructing him to repair its tracking program, emphasizing the importance of accuracy.

Felix initially hesitated, but once he heard it involved Hannah, he fixedit overnight.

Vincent also instructed Felix that as soon as the tracking was activated, he must immediately notify Miles to arrange Hannah's rescue.

Late into the night, Vincent and his bodyguards meticulously examined maps, planning every step. Vincent would arrive first, alone, while his guards would approach discreetly from another island.

At dawn, Vincent boarded a private jet, bound for Riley Island.


***

When Hannah awoke, she discovered she was imprisoned. She was confined in a hotel room, heavily guarded outside.

Daily, she received good food and drink, but surveillance cameras constantly monitored her. She had repeatedly attempted excuses to leave, but her captors ignored every plea.

Without a phone or clock, Hannah lost track of how long she'd been held captive. She never met the mastermind behind her abduction or understood their real intent. Her mind raced anxiously-could Brinley have escaped from prison?

Suddenly, a deep male voice resonated outside, and finally, the tightly locked door swung open.

At last, she faced the orchestrator of her captivity. The man was short and wore a contemptuous sneer as he ordered, "Clean her up and get her ready. Our honored guest will arrive soon. Such a beautiful woman should look her best. WNe wouldn't want to disappoint."

Immediately, four women stepped forward, guiding Hannah forcefully from the room.
###Chapter 202 The True Mastermind


Hannah thought "getting her ready" would mean something simple or routine. She never imagined she'd end up wearing a white wedding dress and a veil.

A cold sense of dread settled in her chest. What could her captors possibly be planning?

Once Hannah was fully dressed, she was led to a long table to sit down. Someone draped the veil over her face, and the moment she was in place, an armed guard took position at her side, watching her closely as if she might try to escape.

Carefully, Hannah studied her surroundings. It didn't take long to figure out she was in a hotel.

Mason Quill, the short, stocky man from before, caught her checking the exits. "Don't get clever,sweetheart," he remarked.

She gave him a nod, pretending to cooperate. Her mind raced. Who exactly was this honored guest? Was she about to be traded away? Her eyes flicked to the pistol at the guard's waist. If it came to that, she was ready to risk it all.

Just then, the hotel's main doors swung open. Vincent walked in at a steady pace, dressed in laid-back clothes.

The sight of Hannah in the wedding dress stopped him in his tracks. He stared, unable to believe what he was seeing, like someone lost in the desert stumbling upon a spring, afraid to even blink in case it vanished.Then, his pace quickened on its own.

Hannah's eyes widened the instant she saw Vincent. The truth dawned on her right away-he was the one they had been waiting for all along.

As Vincent drew closer, Mason signaled a group of guards. They moved in and stopped Vincent two meters from the table, guns drawn. At Mason's command, they frisked him, making sure he was unarmed.

Once they finished, Mason approached, looking very pleased with himself."Very cooperative, Mr. Jones. Just like the lovely Ms. Scott here."

Vincent shot him a cold look. "And you are?"

With a smug smile, Mason stuck out his hand. "Forgive my manners. I'm Mason Quill."

Vincent took a moment and then accepted the handshake.

Mason swept a hand toward Hannah."We put the bride together especially for you. I hope you're happy with what you see."

Someone lifted Hannah's veil.

Hannah's and Vincent's eyes met across the table.

In that instant, Hannah saw everything in Vincent's gaze-relief, shock, and a storm of deeper emotions, all quickly forced down and locked away.

Vincent straightened the rumpled collar of his shirt beforetaking a seat directly across from Hannah at the long table. His eyes swept over her, searching for any visible signs of harm. When he saw she was unhurt,he finally let out a quiet breath. He didn't waste a second. "Let's get to the point," he said in a cold tone."You lured me here. What do you want?"

Mason took the seat beside Vincent, letting out a low laugh. "I like a man who's direct."

He gave the tabletop a tap, and someone handed over a folder. At the top of the first page, bold words read,"Transfer of Trade Rights-Port of Agosphia."

A single glance at the paperwork was enough for Hannah to figure it out-they had taken her as leverage,hoping to force Vincent's hand.

She understood Vincent well. Even if things had turned cold between them, there was still history-he would never turn his back on her. But she also knewv the price they were demanding was outrageous. Billions in globál trade rights-all just to save her? No one should have to make that choice.

Vincent saw the truth right away-this was their real objective. His eyes skimmed the contract, and in the corner of his vision, he noticed Mason sneaking glances at the upper level. With a snap, Vincent shut the folder. "Fine. The terms are clear. I'll sign. But you let her go first." He nodded at Hannah for emphasis.

Mason flashed a smug look. "You must realize, Mr. Jones, this building is packed with my men. Do you really think you're in any place to make demands?"

Again, Mason's eyes darted toward the second floor. "Once the contract's signed, you get your bride back-unharmed, that's a promise."

Vincent leaned back, tossing the folder onto the table. "If I signed that right now, neither she nor I would leave here alive." His fingers drummed lightly on the wood. "You've got more men hiding out than the few in this room."

Vincent had noticed the hidden guards the moment he stepped inside. Their numbers weren't as few as Mason pretended.

That wiped the smile off Mason's face. "Mr. Jones, you really don't miss much, do you?"

Vincent's eyes narrowed."My patience is running out. Let her go and keep me instead. Isn't it me you really want?"

Mason hesitated, eyes flickering upstairs again.′′We∥1−′′

Before he could finish, Vincent sprang into action. He reached out and locked Mason in a tight chokehold."If you're not the boss, bring out the person who is."

Hannah's heart pounded-so Mason wasn't in charge after all.

A deep, mocking chuckle echoed from above. A group of guards came down the staircase, surrounding a man with a cane.

Vincent let go of Mason and shot a cold smile toward the newcomer. "I knew you'd show your face."

The man with the cane grinned. "I see you're not surprised to see me,are you?"
###Chapter 203 | Can't Stand To See A Woman Bleed


The gentleman leaning on the cane went by the name Hoffman Francis. In the past, he shared a business venture with Vincent. But their clashing perspectives pushed Vincent to single-handedly remove him from the partnership list.

When the document regarding the port trade rights transfer surfaced, Vincent had sensed something,especially as Mason repeatedly glanced toward the second level. His instincts had warned him that Hoffman had orchestrated everything from the shadows.

Vincent cast a steely gaze at Hoffman. "It wasn't hard to speculate."

Hoffman burst into loud laughter."All these years, and your instincts remain razor-sharp."

Hoffman hobbled over to where Hannah was and suddenly turned violent, seizing her neck with an iron clutch.

A wave of suffocation overwhelmed Hannah. She resisted Hoffman's grasp, but the pressure never relented.

Vincent's brows drew together in fury as he crushed the impulse to charge forward and kill. His tone was like ice. "Still enjoy tormenting women, don't you?"

Hoffman gave a crooked grin, entertained by Vincent's fury. "What, already feeling protective?"

He loosened his grip on Hannah's throat.

Hannah gasped and grasped her throat, now scored with crimson bruises from his hand.

Hoffman gave a low laugh. "So the heartless Vincent finally has Achilles' Heel. What a surprise."

Initially skeptical when his men reported Vincent's profound feelings toward Hannah, Hoffman had staged Hannah's fake demise, watching Vincent writhe in anguish for days until he finally believed Vincent had a fundamental weakness. Just now, he provoked once more, and although Vincent seemed unbothered, a flicker of murderous rage betrayed him. Capturing this woman was indeed a calculated triumph. Hannah remained calm inside, knowing that Vincent would rescue her not from affection, but out of obligation, since she had fallen into danger because of him. She lowered her face, her eyes flicking discreetly toward the nearby guards.

Vincent's stare drifted coldly from Hannah over to Hoffman. His voice cut like frost. "Whose weakness would be an ex-wife?"

With backup still distant, Vincent knew he needed to prolong the conversation and buy some time. "You've gone to great lengths to lure me here, not just for the port in Agosphia, right?" he asked plainly.

Hoffman laughed. "I appreciate dealing with sharp minds. Let's not waste words. This isn't merely about the port in Agosphia-I want to revive the partnership we abandoned."

Vincent's expression darkened. "What if I decline?"

Hoffman chuckled lowly. "Then all you'll carry home is your bride's corpse. Blood on a wedding gown-it paints such a chilling image." His face contorted into something cruel.

Vincent's demeanor grew heavier. "If this is a deal, act like it." He gestured toward Hannah. "I'll remain, but she leaves."

Hoffman paused briefly and then gave a direct answer. "Fine, though-one term applies."

He withdrew a pistol from his coat. "Since we're settling terms, let's balance our accounts." He pointed to his leg. "That fracture you gave me-my right leg-surely you haven't forgotten?"

Vincent's face hardened.

Hoffman squeezed the trigger. "To make this alliance smoother, I'll spare you the pain, Mr. Jones. But the price of that injury, your woman will repay it. That's only just."

He finished speaking and aimed the weapon at Hannah's leg.

Hannah clenched her gown, chilled sweat dotting her brow.

"Stop!" Vincent vaulted across the table, forcing Hoffman's gun hand upward toward the ceiling. The guards moved fast to encircle them, but Hoffman raised a hand, signaling them to wait. "Getting protective again, Mr. Jones? Didn't you claim she wasn't your weakness?" Hoffman tucked the weapon away with a knowing look, like he'd expected interference.

Vincent's lips curved faintly, but his stare was ice. "Weakness? No. I just have a principle-I can't stand to see awoman bleed."

Hoffman gave a throaty laugh and slid the pistol across the table toward Vincent. "Then you'll have to take this wound yourself, Mr. Jones."

Hannah sprang up from her seat and raised her voice. "Vincent! Don't listen to him."

But a bodyguard promptly stifled hercry.

Vincent lowered his lashes and took the weapon. His fingers curled around it as he pointed it at Hoffman's forehead.

In a flash, the guards drew their guns and locked onto Vincent.

"Mr. Jones, what's your move?" Hoffman's brow lifted. "If I die here, you and your beloved will join me in the afterlife."
###Chapter 204 Take Her Away


Vincent kept his faceblank while he aimed the gun at his own right leg and pulled the trigger.

The blast drove him down to one knee, and the pain carved deep lines into his forehead as his veins stood out.

Hannah fought desperately, trying to break free from the bodyguards who held her in place.

Hoffman sneered, "I see you mean business, Mr. Jones."

The gun was pried from Vincent's hand by the bodyguards without delay.

Driven by resolve alone, Vincent rose to his feet and reached out a steady hand toward Hoffman."L Hannah go," he said.

"Don't rush. Sign the contract first." Hoffman's eyes glimmered with satisfaction as he motioned for his men to bring the contract over from the table.

Holding the contract up, Hoffman flashed Vincent a sly grin. "Once you sign, she can leave."

Vincent stared at the contract pushed toward him, and after a pause of three seconds, he finally wrote his name.

Looking pleased, Hoffman said, "Mr. Jones, I admire your quick decisions."

One of Hoffman's men grabbed the contract and stood by his side.

As Vincent was about to demand the release, a thunderous blast rattled the doors, sending shockwaves through the lobby and injuring several bodyguards.

Hoffman stood frozen for a moment, confused, just before Vincent sent the table flying and kicked Hoffman hard with his good leg, knocking Hoffman off his feet.

Immediately, Hoffman's bodyguards turned their guns on Vincent. The chaos gave Hannah an opening. She yanked a gun from the nearest guard's belt and spun around,firing at the bodyguard behind Vincent. He dropped with a heavy thud.

Her hand was steady and her eyes never wavered, the shot landing right where she aimed.

Vincent saw a whole new side of Hannah then, and for a moment, his expression changed with a tangle of feelings.He wasted no time in dragging Hannah behind a nearby column for cover.

The bodyguards kept storming in, but they fell one after another, picked off by a sniper from outside.

Hoffman struggled to his feet, looking both angry and shaken. "Vincent, you set me up!"

Gunfire exploded throughout the hotel lobby.

Acting fast, Vincent pressed the tracker on his wristband, trigggering the hotel's alarm system as expected.He fastened the wristband on Hannah's wrist with a look of resolve and leaned in to whisper, "The tracker's active. Miles and Felix are almost here to fetch you. I'll watch your back."

As Hannah listened, she ripped a strip from her dress and used it to wrap Vincent's bleeding thigh. Hearing his instructions, she paused, concern flickering across her face. "You're not leaving with me?"

Steadfast in his decision, Vincent shook his head. "You go first."

Holding onto his hand,Hannah remarked, "This isn't going to be easy. Hoffman's men are out there, and the snipers are around. We should leave together."

Since Vincent's whole purpose had been to save her, she couldn't bear the thought of him risking his life for her sake.

Once more, Hannah refused to budge."We have to go at the same time."

Suddenly,hurried footsteps echoed nearby.

Vincent leaned against the column, slowly straightening up."T一here's no time left." He scanned the lobby quickly, keeping a firm grip on Hannah's wrist.

After spotting a clear escape route, he pointed it out. "Head that way. I'll distract Hoffman." The two agents Vincent had stationed earlier made their way over. Pushing Hannah toward them, Vincent said, "Get her out of here."

"We're on it."

With the wristband clutched in her hand, Hannah understood she couldn't change Vincent's mind, so she decided to go find reinforcements. She trusted that Miles and Felix would never arrive empty-handed. They would definitely have extra help.

Without another word, Hannah hurried after the two agents.

A bodyguard handed Vincent a gun, and he used it to create an opening for Hannah and her protectors. His movements exposed him, and most of the gunfire was now directed his way.

Hoffman spotted Hannah making her escape and shouted, "Don't let her get away!"

At once, the bodyguards shifted their focus and aimed at Hannah.

Vincent took down each of them with quick, precise shots, making sure they couldn't get close to her. His gaze locked on Hoffman, and he sneered, "You won't have another chance."
###Chapter 205 Seriously Wounded


After Hannah escaped, Hoffman dispatched more of his subordinates and instructed them to intensify their assault, rendering Vincent and his men overwhelmed.

Splashes of blood painted Vincent's face and shirt. By then, only five bodyguards managed to still stand by his side, while the rest either lay seriously wounded or dead.

Hoffman's men outnumbered Vincent's several times. He had been planning forthis moment for a long time. Only a small slip-up had allowed Vincent to strike back moments earlier.

Encircled by foes, Vincent and his battered crew saw there was nowhere left to run.

Only at this point did Hoffman dare to appear, his boots grinding into the dirt as he sneered,"You almost took down half my men. That's quite a feat, Vincent."

Wiping blood dripping from his mouth, Vincent shot Hoffman a freezing glare. "Too bad I haven't finished you just yet."

An icy chuckle escaped Hoffman. "Take a look around. You're trapped, and you know it. Here's my offer-get the Jones Group to open up all its ports for my shipments. I'll give you a thirty percent cut."

Without hesitation, Vincent retorted, "Forget about it. That's never going to happen."

Hoffman's tone turned lethal. "Then there's no need for talk. Folks,finish him off."

Securing the port transfer contract had always been Hoffman's main objective. Everything else was a bonus. Vincent's refusal left only one option-he couldn't walk away alive.

Guns were raised as Hoffman's subordinates prepared to shoot Vincent and his men.

"Fire," Hoffman commanded, his gaze fixed and emotionless as he looked on.

A single gunshot shattered the tension. One of Hoffman's subordinates crumpled, a bullet through his head. Confusion twisted Hoffman's face. He snapped his head toward the source, his face clouded over. There stood Hannah, who had slipped away-she had not come back alone.

After escaping from this place, Hannah had wasted no time meeting up with Miles and Felix. She put them in charge of getting reinforcement, but insisted on going back alone first. Luck seemed to be on her side-she made it back just in time.

As soon as Hannah burst through the doors, Vincent's attention locked on her. Gunfire crackled, but she weaved through it, sprinting straight for him, the tactical squad trailing her.

Watching the new arrivals, Hoffman's expression soured. Those officers came prepared for war, and his own crew looked hopelessly outgunned.

A quick scan of the chaos told Hoffman all he needed. He barked at Mason to stay with a few men, ordering them to cover the escape. With a tight circle of bodyguards, he raced up the stairs.

Vincent caught sight of Hoffman vanishing and gave a low order for his wounded guards to fall back and recover.
Hannah skidded to Vincent's side. Before she could say anything, he motioned to have a unit of the tactical.team follow him. He then glanced at her. "I'll be right back," he said before disappearing into the fray.

It was obvious to Hannah Vincent was hunting Hoffman. The tactical unit shadowed himn, and she trusted they could handle whatever lay ahead.

The remaining officers wasted no time. Within moments, Hoffman's men were subdued, while Hannah moved quietly to administer first aid to Vincent's wounded bodyguards one by one, patching them up in the lobby.

Meanwhile, Vincent led the chase. He and the tactical unit burst onto the second floor, where a giant helipad loomed just beyond the exit. Hoffman was trying to flee.

Without hesitation, Vincent lifted his weapon and squeezed off a shot in Hoffman's direction.

Narrowly avoiding the shot, Hoffman ducked behind his line of bodyguards, glaring over his shoulder. "ls this really all you brought? You think this handful of men can kill me?" Vincent did not even blink. "I don't need anyone else to do it."

At Vincent's signal, a wave of tactical officers stepped out from the dim corners, moving fast to confront Hoffman's bodyguards. The bodyguards, already battered and struggling, stood little chance against the highly trained squad now closing in on them.

A flicker of panic crossed Hoffman's face. He fumbled for his pistol, fired a wild shot at Vincent's chest,and staggered backward on his cane, desperation written all over him.

Moving fast, Vincent twisted aside, dodging the shot with barely a breath to spare.He squeezed the trigger,sending his bullet straight for Hoffman.

Nothing could have púshed Vincent further-this time, Hoffman had gone too far. Mercy was out of the question.

A storm of bullets rained from Vincent's side. Hoffman barely managed to lift his weapon. He scrambled for cover, desperation fueling every move, while his eyes darted toward the sky, searching for the telltale whir of his rescue chopper.

Suddenly,pain exploded through Hoffman's left leg as a bullet ripped into him. He crashed down hard,trying to claw his way forward. Shot after shot followed, tearing through his body-first his gut, then his shoulder, and finally his chest.

Blood pooling beneath him, Hoffman could do nothing but lie there, frozen and fading, the last spark of life slipping away. All of his remaining bodyguards had been taken down by the relentless tactical unit.

Meanwhile, things had quieted downstairs. With the gunfire dying down, Hannah's concern pulled her up the stairs to investigate.

Vincent heard Hannah approach, turned, and let his gun fall. He hobbled in her direction, pain etched in every step.

At that moment, everyone assumed the fight was over. Hoffman was subdued.

Only Hannah caught the faint movement-Hoffman, still breathing, reaching inside his coat with trembling hands. With a crooked grin stretched across his face, Hoffman fixed his eyes on her. Though no sound left his mouth, his lips murmured the threat with eerie precision, "If I die, none of you live."

Shock flooded Hannah's face as she realized what he meant. She screamed, "Get back! He's strapped with explosives!"

Chaos erupted as the tactical unit scattered for cover.

Reacting instantly, Hannah grabbed Vincent, dragging him away from the blast radius. His wounds slowed him,forcing her to shield him with her own body at the last possible second.

An eruption shattered the air. When silence returned, Vincent blinked against the dust and pain. He reached for Hannah, shaking her gently. His fingers came away wet, stained with blood.

Where white silk had once shimmered, a crimson patch spread across Hannah's wedding gown.

Watching his trembling hands, Vincent felt the world tilt, grief swallowing him whole.
###Chapter 206 Hannah Couldn't See Anymore


The rooftop of Dorbarrow Hospital pulsed with activity. The helicopter descended, and Vincent passed Hannah into the care of the medical staff.

Vincent trailed them directly to the ICU. A nurse gently advised him that the procedure would take hours and recommended he address his own injuries, yet Vincent declined with a silent shake. Right then, his focus was singular-he needed confirmation from the doctor that Hannah would survive.

Hannah's parents wept nonstop on their way to the hospital once they heard their daughter was still alive.They barged inside, only to learn she'd been admitted to the ICU, and Vincent was stationed outside by himself.

Margaret, swept up in sorrow, threw a punch at Vincent, sobbing, "What happened? Why is Hannah in the ICU? Didn't I warn you to keep away from her? Why is she hurt again because of you? I can't imagine living without her."

Margaret broke down entirely, and Raymond tried in vain to settle her distress. He refused to meet Vincent's eyes,waving him off immediately. "Leave now-we don't want you here."

Vincent bowed, taking in their grief and fury. "I'm sorry. I failed to protect her."

Margaret's tears and fury showed no signs of stopping. Vincent, barely standing on his bleeding leg,propped himself up against the wall, his posture unstable.

Danica and Erica arrived in a rush.

After learning from the bodyguards that Vincent had been shot, Erica had quickly informed Danica. They hadn't anticipated witnessing such a scene upon their arrival.

Danica, still recalling Vincent's earlier warning, was originally reluctant to interfere. Yet, witnessing the aggression toward Vincent, she stepped in, shoving Margaret aside. Her rage ignited, ignoring all earlier warnings. "Your loss is tragic, but my son is not to blame for it. Can't you see he's wounded? It's fortunate he's no longer your son-in-law."

Her words rendered Margaret and Raymond speechless with rage

"Shut up," Vincent muttered, pale and breathless. "Hannah was injured trying to protect me. Could you calm down and stop causing trouble for her parents?"

After that, Vincent doubled over, coughing intensely.

Danica stood frozen. She made to pat his back and comfort him, but Vincent sidestepped, avoiding her touch.

Danica awkwardly retracted her hand. "Still, unleashing all this rage on him wasn't right," she muttered with clenched teeth.

Margaret and Raymond exchanged a glance, finally understanding the reason behind Hannah's injury, their reactions now conflicted.

Erica, who had kept quiet until then, stepped closer to Vincent. "Vincent, you need to see the doctor.You can't delay treating your leg injury,"she advised.

As if to explain her earlier actions, Danica added, "Yes, we came the moment we heard you were hurt. We mean well,truly."

Vincent didn't bulge, his gaze anchored toward the ICU.

Seeing that he wouldn't move, Erica and Danica chose to stay by his side.

Two agonizing hours passed before Hannah was finallywheeled out by the doctor.

Vincent darted over and asked, "How is she?"

"She's stable now. Once she wakes up, she'll just need time to regain strength," the doctor answered,allowing them all to breathe a sigh of relief.

Only Erica clenched her fists in silence.

As Hannah was being taken to the recovery area, Vincent tried to follow, but Raymond blocked his path."I don't want you anywhere near my daughter."

Vincent stopped in his tracks.

Unable to stay silent, Danica muttered, "The Scott family could at least show some gratitude. We've been waiting by the ICU for so long after all."

Vincent shot her a frigid glare. "You never know when to shut up, don't you?"

Without another word, he walked away, Erica following in silence.

Vincent refused anesthesia despite the agony during,the bullet extraction. The injury was severe, and both Erica and Danica grimaced during the procedure, but Vincent endured with only suppressed groans.

Once the treatment concluded, Vincent fell asleep from exhaustion, only waking up the next morning. He made straight for Hannah's room, desperate to know if she had awakened.

Upon entering,he found Hannah sitting upright. Relieved, he was about to greet her when she asked, "Are you the nurse? Could you turn on the light?"

Vincent stiffened. The space was clearly illuminated, and sunlight streamed outside... He inched toward Hannah, waving a hand before her eyes. She didn't react in the slightest. Hannah couldn't see anymore?
###Chapter 207 | Didn't Save You Because | Cared


Vincent's mind spun with confusion. Before he could settle his thoughts, Hannah's parents swept into the room, bringing a doctor along with them.

As more people crowded the space, Hannah's voice cut through the tension."Why aren't the lights on?" she asked, sounding puzzled.

She had difficulty seeing in the dark and couldn't see anything without light. She disliked darkness and could never sleep without her lamp casting a soft glow.

Stunned, Vincent was rooted to the spot.

Margaret shot him a glare and marched over, trying to nudge him toward the exit. "You are not welcome here," she said,her words sharp.

Vincent managed to keep his balance, his voice shaking. "I just wanted to see how she was doing..."

The moment Raymond noticed Vincent, anger flooded his face."A∥I of this happened because of you! How dare you show your face here?"

For a moment, Vincent could not find any words at all.

Hannah tried to understand their conversation until the truth abruptly crashed down on her. The darkness wasn't because the lights were off. Was she unable to see anymore? Blindly reaching out, she searched for her mother's hand. "Mom?"

Margaret rushed to Hannah, tears streaming down her cheeks. She wrapped her arms around Hannah,her words trembling as she tried to soothe Hannah. "I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere. Sweetheart,everything's going to be alright. There's no need to be scared. The doctor's here now, so let's listen to what he has to say."

Hannah tightly held Margaret's hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. Raymond looked on, eyes shining with tears he couldn't hold back.

After a thorough examination, the doctor finally spoke up. "It appears the explosion caused a blood clot. It's pressing on the optic nerve, and that's why she can't see for now."

The idea of blindness settled heavily in the room.

Raymond's voice came out thick with worry. "If we begin treatment immediately, is there hope for her sight?"

"We believe this blindness may be temporary," the doctor replied, his expression serious. "But we cannot rule out the possibility of permanent blindness. We'll need more tests to know for sure."

These words hit Raymond and Margaret hard, leaving them unsteady on their feet. How had their perfectly healthy daughter ended up like this?

Those last few words, permanent blindness, echoed in Vincent's mind, filling his eyes with tears. "I'll get in touch with overseas specialists right away."

Hannah's vacant eyes drifted in the direction of Vincent's voice. "That's not necessary," she said quietly.

To her, their marriage was already behind them. Now that the immediate danger had passed, she saw no reason for her blindness to keep Vincent tethered to her life.

Stepping forward, Vincent's words came out rough. "All of this happened because of me. I just can't leave you alone."

Hannah remarked, "I didn't save you because I cared. Anyone in your shoes would have gotten the same help from me."

She was telling the truth. She had saved him without any personal feelings involved. She'd simply done what was right.

A shadow crossed Vincent's face. His wounded leg began to throb, and he could not stop himself from wincing.

Catching sight of Vincent's injury, the doctor's expression turned stern. "Your leg is bleeding again. Don't you feel that? You need proper care and rest."

No answer came from Vincent, who just stood there, unresponsive.

Shaking his head at Vincent's stubbornness, the doctor turned to Hannah's parents. "Your daughter needs a calm environment and absolutely no stress. I'll arrange things with the nurse and get the tests ready."

With instructions given, the doctor made his exit.

Not hesitating for a second, Margaret nudged Vincent out and shut the door behind him. "Leave. We don't want to see you," she said, her tone firm.

Vincent lingered outside Hannah's ward for a few moments before deciding to go. At noon, having arranged for a few doctors to come by, he planned to sneak a peek at Hannah while her parents grabbed some midday rest.

When Vincent arrived at the doorway of Hannah's hospital room, he found her alone.

As Hannah reached out blindly, feeling for her water glass, Vincent hastily entered and moved toward her.

A nurse was who Hannah expected, but Vincent's unique scent quickly gave him away.

Carefully, Vincent pressed the glass into her hands, but she kept her fingers curled and refused to accept it."Why are you here again?" Hannah asked, her brow furrowing.

Rather than explain himself, Vincent said, "Just drink some water. You were thirsty, weren't you?"

Hannah's voice turned cold. "I'm not thirsty anymore." She added,"My parents don't want you around.You're only making things harder."

Her meaning was clear-her blindness was more than enough for her parents to worry about, and she wanted Vincent to stop adding to their distress.

"Everything's been settled between us. You don't owe me anything," Hannah said, her voice even but distant.

Not missing the cold edge in her words, Vincent recognized her stance. His gaze dimmed, and though he wanted to speak, he didn't know what tosay.

The silence stretched between them.

Just then, a female voice shattered the awkward silence. "I figured I'd find you here."

Erica walked in, rolling a wheelchair she'd fetched for Vincent. She posed a question to Hannah in a polite tone. "Ms. Scott, how are you feeling?"

"All good," Hannah replied, keeping her answer short.

Growing more attuned to the world through sounds.and smells, Hannah had no trouble identifying Erica."Good timing. You can take him away now."

Erica's expression softened with concern. "Vincent needs to rest. His leg isn't healing well, so I'm here to bring him back." As she helped him settle into the wheelchair, her eyes flicked to Hannah.′′MIs. Scott, is your vision gone?"

"That's right," Hannah answered lightly.

Vincent interjected, "She'll recover." Hope burned in him, unwilling to accept any other outcome.He was determined to find a way to restore her sight.

Feeling his profound worry for Hannah, Erica's hands tightened around the handles of the wheelchair.Without further delay, she wheeled Vincent back to his room, planning to talk through everything that had happened.

But once back to his ward, Vincent grabbed his phone, launching into a rapid conversation with a specialist in another language.

Although the details escaped Erica, she was certain his call had everything to do with Hannah.

Erica's jealousy flared up. Since her return from abroad, Vincent hadn't paid much attention on her. A shadow crept over her face as she watched him.

Citing to run an errand, Erica left Vincent's room. Moments later, she disguised herself as a nurse, altered her voice, and made her way to Hannah's bedside. Acting every bit the diligent nurse, Erica escorted Hannah from her room for a11rotutine check."

With gentle direction from "the nurse" and no reason to suspect otherwise, Hannah followed the guidance,never guessing anything was amiss as the elevator carried them upward.
###Chapter 208 | Would Never Take My Own Life


Vincent had just received a clear update from the doctors and was about to set off and speak with Hannah's parents when the hospital room door burst open.

Hannah's parents charged in,their faces contorted with fury.

"Where did you take my daughter this time?" Margaret shouted, nearly hysterical.

"She's missing?" Vincent's eyes instantly darkened. Grasping the gravity of the situation, he sprang out of bed, ignoring the stabbing pain in his injured leg, and bolted out the door.

He moved with such urgency that Hannah's parents barely registered his swift exit.

Vincent raced straight to the hospital's security room, terrified that Hoffman's remaining associates might have abducted Hannah as revenge, especially with her blindness leaving her particularlyvulnerable.

He forced himself to remain composed, meticulously scanning every surveillance feed, desperately seeking any sign of her. Finally, his gaze locked onto the elevator footage.

Zooming in, he noted with dread that the elevator was ascending to the rooftop. His heart skipped violently,and without a second's hesitation, he raced toward the stairs.

Meanwhile, on the rooftop, Erica guided Hannah forward with a gentle touch on her arm. Suddenly, Hannah hesitated, sensing something was off. "Why can't I hear any doctors?" All she could hear was the wind whistling around them.

Erica casually lied, "They're busy with their rounds. I'm the only one operating the machine today."

Still uneasy, Hannah cautiously stretched out her hands to feel her surroundings.

At that precise moment, Erica withdrew her support, coaxing softly but deliberately, "Just like that, step forward a little more. I'll get the equipment ready."

As Hannah moved hesitantly, Erica stepped back with a sinister smirk. "That's perfect. Lie down right there. Everything's ready."

Erica's eyes narrowed as she closely observed Hannah's movements, repeating her instructions.

But Hannah abruptly stopped-her foot brushed against something. Instinctively sensing danger, she drew back.

Erica's face contorted in frustration. It was clear-she'd have to take matters into her own hands. All Hannah had to do was fall-it would appear as suicide, plain and simple. No one would trace it back to her. There was no way Hannah could survive a fall from thirty-plus stories.

Erica hissed inwardly, "Hannah, don't blame me-blame yourself for still occupying Vincent's heart even after the divorce."

Erica crept closer, each step silent as a shadow, her breath shallow with tension. Her hand hovered mere inches from Hannah's back.

Yet, Hannah, perhaps sensing the imminent danger, swiftly turned and caught Erica's wrist in a tight grip.Her voice cut sharply through the wind. "Who are you?"

Caught off guard, Erica froze momentarily. The act was up. With a decisive move, she shoved Hannah toward the rooftop edge, triggering a desperate struggle between them.

Driven by survival instincts, Hannah exerted her utmost power to fight back. She could feel her heart pounding, the adrenaline pumping. The fight was evenly matched, neither gaining an advantage.

Suddenly, rapid footsteps echoed from the stairwell. Cursing under her breath, Erica disengaged and disappeared through another rooftop exit.

Vincent burst onto the rooftop, heart pounding as he saw Hannah perilously close to the edge.Holding his breath, he cautiously approached, determined not to startle her.

Hannah steadied herself and managed to catch her breath. She mistakenly took Vincent's approaching footsteps for her attacker's and cried out, "Stay back!"

"Don't do anything reckless," Vincent urged, his voice shaking despite his effort to remain steady. "The doctors said there's hope-a way to fix the blindness."

"Vincent?" Hannah immediately recognized his voice.

"Yes, it's me." Slowly and carefully, he extended his hand. "Take my hand and come back from there."

Reassured by his familiar voice, Hannah reached out toward him, longing for safety.

Vincent immediately grasped her hand so tightly that it made her wince.

Hidden in the shadows, Erica watched with bitter resentment before slipping quietly away.

"Ow, you're hurting me," Hannah complained, trying to pull free.

But Vincent tightened his grip even further, swallowing hard. His voice thickened with emotion."Why would you try to end your life? If you really died, I-" He paused abruptly, changing his next words quickly. "What about your parents? Have you ever thought about their feelings?"

He understood how devastating sudden blindness could be, especially given Hannah's previous struggles with depression. Such trauma could easily push someone to the edge.

Hannah quickly pieced it together. No wonder Vincent was so shaken-he thought she'd intended to take her own life. "Did you really think I was trying to jump?" she asked.

Before Vincent could reply, she calmly continued, "I'd never take my own life."

She had already survived so much-slander, heartache, countless failed suicide attempts. She had withstood all that, and blindness seemed trivial by comparison. She had learned to accept life's trials. The good and the bad-she'd embrace them both.

"Ever since our divorce, my life has only improved," she remarked confidently. "Why would I kill myself over mere blindness?"

Oddly enough, instead of relief, a frown deepened on Vincent's face.
###Chapter 209 I Don't Want Things Between Us To Just End


Vincent caught the implication instantly-Hannah hadn't come up to the rooftop by choice. "Someone led you up here on purpose?"

Hannah nodded, brow furrowed in thought. "That person claimed to be a nurse from the hospital, but something didn't feel right. The voice sounded like a man's, but when I tried to break free, I could tell it was a woman."

Earlier, as Hannah grappled with the figure, the contact had made one thing certain-it was a woman. But whoever it was had likely slipped away by now.

Vincent's jaw tightened, his tone deadly grim. "I'll find out who's behind this." Every instinct of his screamed that this had Hoffman's fingerprints all over it-a loyalist making their move.

He stepped forward, offering his arm. "Let's get you downstairs." He bet her parents were probably panicked with worry by now.

Hannah didn't argue-she wanted out of this place just as badly as he did.

With no elevator up to the rooftop, they were forced to take a narrow, winding stairwell.

Vincent steadied her with one arm, his steps uneven from his injured leg, while Hannah-unable to see a thing-clung to his sleeve, the two of them inching cautiously down, relying on each other to keep from falling.

Trying to ease her worries, Vincent shared some hopeful news. "I've arranged for an ophthalmology specialist to fly in. She'll be here in two days to examine you."

At that, Hannah came to a halt, brow creased. "You don't need to go out of your way and do this."

Vincent stepped in front of her, blocking her path with quiet resolve. "It's my responsibility."

She shook her head, her tone stripped of emotion. "It isn't. My temporary loss of eyesight is my own burden -you don't owe me anything."

Since the divorce, Hannah had turned down his favors time and again. Vincent's jaw tensed as he stated,
"Fine. Then consider it a favor between friends."

"I don't keep ex-husbands as friends." Hannah shot back, her tone flat.

He had no answer for that-her words left him standing in silence.

"My eyes are my problem. You don't need to get involved," she added, her voice clipped.

He pressed his lips into a thin line. "I've already set up an appointment with the specialist. She'll see you in a few days. By then, I'll arrange for someone to pick you up. That's all there is to it."

Without waiting for her protest, he slipped his hand into hers and quietly guided her down the rest of the stairs.

Hannah didn't want to drag out the conversation. Whether or not she saw the doctor was her own business -Vincent had no say in it.

They walked the rest of the way in strained silence, neither willing to break it until they finally reached the elevator.

Without warning, Vincent broke the quiet. "Your marksmanship... It was impressive."

She froze, caught off guard.

His voice softened, barely above a whisper. "And I don't want things between us to just end."

She heard every word. Her lips parted, as if 'searching for a response, but nothing came out.

Meanwhile, Hannah's parents had been panicking to the point of nearly calling the police. When spotting Vincent leading Hannah back, Margaret's relief melted away, replaced by fury. She strode over and slapped Vincent hard across the face. "So, it was you who took her away! Haven't you done enough damage to her already?"

A bright red mark instantly bloomed on Vincent's cheek. He didn't say a word-just pressed his tongue against the inside of his cheek.

Raymond stood off to the side, arms folded, his face carved from ice.

Margaret, cheeks still flushed with rage, looked seconds away from lashing out again, but Hannah stepped in before she could. "Mom, stop-this isn't what you think. Some stranger dragged me up to the roof.Vincent's the one who brought me back."

Margaret paused, her anger faltering just enough to let doubt flicker across her face. But she was still displeased with Vincent. "That doesn't change anything. Every time he's around, you end up getting hurt."

Vincent's jaw clenched. Shadows flickered in his eyes.

Raymond gave a silent nod in agreement, his expression grim.

Hannah steered her parents into her hospital room. The door slammed shut behind them, right in Vincent's face.

Meanwhile,Erica had already peeled off her disguise as the nurse, all costume tossed into a dumpster. Not wasting a second, she'd slipped seamlessly back into her own clothes and returned to Vincent's ward to fetch the wheelchair. She'd pushed the wheelchair toward Hannah's room, silently watching as Vincent was scolded.

Once she decided the moment was right, she rolled over, putting on a breathless, worried act. "Vincent,there you are! I've been searching for you everywhere. WNhy didn't you rest in your room? Your mom brought food-she was worried sick when she couldn't find you."

Vincent didn't have much of an appetite. He was barely holding himself up, his body slumped heavily against the wheelchair. The reckless way he'd been moving had split his wound wide open, fresh blood trickling down his leg.

Erica,noticing the fresh bleeding, couldn't help but scold, "Seriously, Vincent? Do you really want to bind yourself to a wheelchair forever?"


He rubbed his forehead, not bothering to answer. Erica wheeled him back toward his ward. A short while later, a nurse carefully rebandaged his leg with practiced efficiency. Holding nothing back, she issued a blunt warning. "If you tear this wound open again, you could do permanent damage. Starting today,you're not allowed to move it at all. Wheelchair only, understood?"

Hearing that,Danica immediately nodded in agreement.

Once the nurse stepped out, Danica pulled Erica into the hallway under the pretense of fetching water.She pressed for details and quickly learned that Vincent had dragged himself around the hospital, risking his injury just to track down Hannah.

Irritation simmering beneath the surface, Danica walked back into Vincent's ward. She spoke softly, forcing calm into her voice. "If you want to thank Hannah, there are a thousand other ways. You didn't have to put your leg at risk for this."

Erica folded her arms and shot Vincent a disapproving look. "Exactly. You need to take this seriously. You two aren't married anymore-there's no sense in putting your life on the line for someone who's moved on."

Danica jumped in with a quick, "That's right!"

Their words grated on Vincent's nerves. He ordered both women out. The moment he was alone, his expression turned icy. He picked up his phone and issued orders for a full security sweep of the hospital staff. Until they caught the culprit, he wouldn't let himself relax.

···
Hannah had spent nearly three days confined to her hospital bed.

Felix and Rena had both stopped by, each bringing business cards for top ophthalmologists they'd managed to track down.

Hannah had taken the contacts with a grateful smile, promising she'd follow up and do everything she could to regain her sight.

What gutted Hannah most wasn't the darkness itself-it was the helplessness, the constant need to depend on others for even the smallest things. Her parents tried to be there as much as possible, but they couldn't stay glued to her side every second.
Just then, a sudden knock jolted Hannah from her thoughts. Heart racing, she slowly straightened. "Who's there?"

A voice she knew all too well broke the silence, oozing with contempt. "Hannah, what's the deal? Are you really blind or just putting on a show?"

It was none other than Daphne.
###Chapter 210 Don't You Worry That She'll Resent You For It


Hannah assumed that Daphne had shown up to stir up trouble again, and a quiet unease began to settle in her chest.

"Show some respect," said a voice sternly.

Only when Hannah heard Miles' voice did her guard drop. Surprise colored her words. "Mr. Whitaker? !didn't expect you."

Daphne grumbled a few words in dissatisfaction.

"Not just him, I'm here too," a female voice chimed in.

"Mrs. Whitaker!" Hannah couldn't help but smile at the familiar gentleness in Irene's voice.

Setting down a basket of fruits, Miles addressed Hannah, "Word got around that you weren't well. I wanted to see how you were holding up. I hope this isn't a bad time."

Quick to reassure him, Hannah responded, "Not at al. I actually hoped to speak with you, Mr. Whitaker."

Guessing her intention, Miles asked, "Is this about Polaris Tech?"

Oddly enough, although Hannah couldn't see for now, and her eyes were vacant and unfocused, Miles felt he'd just seen the glint of excitement in her eyes. There was no hiding that spark.

"Right again," Hannah replied with a soft laugh. A sense of relief settled over her, knowing that Nova Tech was making strides on the wristband project based on user feedback, so there was little left for her to worry about.

Eager to share, Miles filled Hannah in on the latest progress with Polaris Tech's gaming line.

While their conversation grew more animated, Irene quietly slipped away to wash some fruit.

Miles explained every detail in a calm, measured tone. Hannah felt the weight lift from her shoulders. The gaming project was on track, and her anticipation for the finished game quietly grew.

Standing off to the side, Daphne eyed Hannah suspiciously."Dyou even know anything about gaming?"she blurted out.

A swift look from Miles silenced her. "You're speaking out of turn again."

"It's fine, Mr. Whitaker." A gentle smile spread across Hannah's face as she turned in the direction of Daphne's voice. "I actually have a good grasp of gaming."

Not letting the moment pass, Miles gave Daphne a pointed look. "You do remember the real reason you're here,don't you?"

Daphne twisted her fingers and murmured, "I'm sorry." Her voice was almost inaudible.

Hannah didn't catch it and asked in confusion, "What is it?"

Drawing a deep breath, Daphne hissed, "I said I'm sorry. Satisfied?" Her gaze shifted to Miles as she uttered the last word.

Without waiting for a reply, Daphne dashed out of the room.

Watching his sister's retreating figure, Miles let out a resigned breath. "She's always gotten her way since we were kids. Please forgive her behavior and what happened before. I apologize on her behalf."

"It's alright, Mr. Whitaker. It's all in the past," Hannah assured him. So much had happened since that day,and she had long since let it go.

Before Hannah could add anything else, a chorus of cheerful voices spilled in from the hallway. Her parents,along with Miles' mother, were approaching. They chatted and laughed, creating a lively atmosphere.

Irene had bumped into Raymond and Margaret while searching for the right hospital room.

As soon as Irene mentioned Hannah, Raymnond and Margaret had instantly grasped her intention.Once they started chatting,they'd hit it off instantly.

Smiling, Margaret's attention landed on Mil es, and she posed the question to Irene. "So this is your son? He's quite dashing."

Irene responded with genuine warmth,"Your daughter is absolutely lovely."

Curiosity got the better of Margaret, who peppered Miles with questions, leaving Hannah to massage her temples in resignation.

Throughout the conversation, Miles answered every question with patience and politeness.

When Hannah's parents' enthusiasm became a bit much, Miles gracefully cited work as his excuse to leave.

Slipping out into the hallway, he immediately noticed'Vincent waiting nearby in awheelchair,watching him quietly.

Vincent's expression was somber."Let's talk."

Nodding,Miles pushed his wheelchair down the corridor, heading toward the hospital's garden walkway.

Out of nowhere, Vincent remarked, "Hannah's parents are very pleased with you."

Miles couldn't resist poking Vincent for fun. "Yeah. It's gotten a bit out of hand. I heard someone gets chased away every day."

Day after day, Vincent found himself halted at the threshold of Hannah's ward, always sent away before he could see her.

Vincent glared at him. "You seem to know quite a lot."

Miles only lifted an eyebrow, unfazed. "Let's cut to the point."

Vincent sat up straighter. "I need you to think of a reason, any reason, to take Hannah away from here."

Confusion flickered in Miles' eyes. "What exactly are you trying to do?"

Without holding back, Vincent explained firmly, "She needs expert care. I want her to get proper treatment,but I don't want her parents to worry themselves sick." He grasped that Hannah's parents would only feel at ease if they assumed he wasn't the one who had proposed the treatment plan and arranged every detail. "Have you even talked to Hannah about this? Would she agree?" Miles asked, clearly doubtful that Hannah wanted Vincent involved in her decisions.

Vincent lowered his gaze. Hannah would never agree. She wouldn't accept his help. At this point, however,her wishes took a back seat to what he saw as urgent.

Vincent sidestepped the question entirely and said in a firm voice, "Everything's been arranged-the facility,the medical team. She's going to get the best care possible."

A moment of hesitation crossed Miles's face. "It sounds more like keeping her locked away. Don't you worry that she'll resent you for it?"

"If that's what it takes,'then so be it." Vincent's voice came out rough with emotion. Night after night, every time he shut his eyes, all he could picture was Hannah's struggle with daily needs due to her blindness.For him, nothing else mattered. If there was even a chance her sight could be restored, he was ready to sacrifice anything.
###Chapter 211 Proceeded With The Treatment Plan


Miles narrowed his gaze in puzzlement. "Wouldn't it be easier to introduce the doctor to HHannah?" Mr.Jones, this felt unlike how you typically handle things."

In Miles' mind, Vincent had always been decisive and efficient, never inclined to take a roundabout approach. Strangely, how he'd navigated this divorce was anything but clean-cut.

Vincent refused to delve into details. "Just consider it.me overstepping."

Miles hesitated. "I'll need time to mull it over."

Vincent said nothing.

Following a brief silence, Miles found himself asking,11|sthis all because you still have feelings for Hannah?"

A flicker of uncertainty flashed across Vincent's gaze. "I'm unsure." Lately, his thoughts had been completely chaotic.

Miles leaned in. "Then are you doing this out of remorse?"

Vincent shut his eyes. "Don't ask anymore. I'm counting on you for this."

···

Afterward, Miles made his way back to Hannah's ward, bringing along a suggested therapy plan for her vision, courtesy of Vincent.

Once Miles clarified why he was here, both Margaret and Raymond beamed with joy and repeatedly expressed gratitude.

Miles responded with composure,"Nlo need to thank me. Ms. Scott and I are business partners-it's only natural to help."

Hannah's parents took time absorbing the document. Everything looked formal and thoroughly prepared. Miles added, "This doctor is internationally acclaimed. There's a 95% chance of success. Opportunities like this are rare."

"We want to proceed," both Margaret and Raymond said in unison.

Hannah recalled the specialists she'd reached out to over recent days-all had delivered grim projections.Her parents had been extremely distressed. Now presented with this renewed possibility, she saw no grounds to decline. "Could I have the location, Mr. Whitaker? I want to head there immediately."

Miles lifted an eyebrow. "I'm en route myself. I'll bring you along."

Hannah paused a moment and then replied, "Thanks,Mr.Whitaker."

In the end, she chose not to include her parents, concerned that if the outcome turned grim, they wouldn't handle it well.

Not long after, Miles's vehicle pulled out, Hannah quietly seated in the rear.

They chatted casually on the way. Having interacted often recently, their exchange had grown increasingly comfortable.

"Mr. Whitaker," Hannah remarked with a gentle grin,"you seem more approachable now."

Miles let out a soft laugh. "Are you implying I was difficult before?"

Hannah giggled. "I just mean you seem easier to talk to now."

Recognizing that she was alluding to his earlier aloofness, Miles admitted,"1used to have a bias against you..."

But gradually, he'd witnessed her strengths-how she acted decisively and stayed calm under strain. Only after getting to know her did he truly begin to grasp her true character.

Seeing a subtle weariness across her features, he asked, "Didn't sleep well last night?"

Hannah gave a faint nod. "Yes. I felt anxious."

Miles paused. It suddenly hit him-everyone felt Hannah appeared unfazed by her condition. But in truth, she only put up a front. She was hiding her fear. Deep down, she lay awake at night. She was terrified of the results. This whole thing wasn't easy on her at all.

He swallowed hard before finally saying, "Close your eyes. I'll let you know once we get there."

The address Vincent had provided was situated in a place named Mapleridge, and the trip there took a full two hours by car.

By the time Miles and Hannah reached the facility, both Vincent and the eye specialist, Dr. MAarie Heidemann,stood by the gate awaiting them. Vincent's leg had healed enough for a cautious but stable walk.

As the car came to a halt, Marie gently assisted Hannah in stepping out. Miles stayed put inside the vehicle.

Once Hannah had gone ahead, Vincent placed a hand lightly on Miles' shoulder.

Miles understood instantly-it was Vincent's silent show of gratitude.

Feeling conflicted, Miles said nothing and eventually pulled away, calling Hannah's parents during the drive to give them an update.

When the call ended, his face hardened. It belatedly occurred to him that maybe he had gone too far in offering help this time.

Meanwhile, inside the consultation room, throughout the check-up, Marie's approach remained calm and courteous. At no point did Hannah feel uneasy.

Yet, after the tests ended, Hannah wasn't allowed to leave. Her phone wasn't returned either, and the results were delivered with little clarity.

Eventually, Marie exited the room and didn't return, leaving Hannah locked in by herself.

The sheer absence of answers and lack of ways to reach the outside world unnerved Hannah. A deep fear began to stir within. As she groped around the unknown room, her hand struck a cup, sending it tumbling with a sharp clang. The sound made her gasp in alarm.

Not far away,Vincent had been reviewing reports with Marie.Hearing the commotion, he rushed toward Hannah at once. Holding back the concern tugging at his expression, he silently supported her.

Yet, his unique scent lingered on him-Hannah could recognize it anywhere. Her brows drew together as she asked, "Vincent?"
###Chapter 212 Feeding Her Medicine


Vincent didn't hesitate. "It's mne," he admitted, his voice low but steady. He'd meant to stay in the shadows,letting Hannah recover in peace, but she'd caught on faster than he'd planned.

Hannah's posture stiffened, every muscle tense. "Why are you here?" she demanded, bracing herself for whatever explanation he might spin.

Sidestepping her question, Vincent scanned the floor, spotted shards of broken glass, and immediately stepped closer. Without warning, he swept her off her feet, his arms circling her securely.

The abrupt lift sent Hannah's pulse racing. She clung instinctively to his neck, voice sharp with panic."Vincent, what on earth are you doing?"

He caught the slight tremor in her grip, and for an instant, the rigid lines of his face softened. Cradling her,he carried her straight into the adjacent sunroom and set her down with tenderness, guiding her gently into a chair.

Settling in, Hannah couldn't shake off the unease she felt from the way Vincent moved through the place,like he was familiar with the layout. A thought flickered through her mind. Doubt crept into her mind like a shadow. She kept her voice cautious, every word measured. "When can I go back?"

Vincent paused, weighing his words before finally answering, "You can leave when you've fully recovered."

Hannah's chest tightened. Her tone shot up, sharp and raw. "So it was you who arranged all this."

Vincent remembered the doctor's warning-staying emotionally steady was crucial during this recovery phase. He gentled his tone,careful not to agitate her. "Take it easy. You're safe here. Everything in this place was arranged for your treatment."

Hannah rose from her chair, defiance blazing in her posture. "I want to leave right now!"

Every nerve in her body bristled at being managed like this. She hated being placed in situations without her knowledge or consent. He could've just talked to her. Vincent kept his words measured, his face unreadable. "The best specialists are here-your ophthalmologist, your therapist, round-the-clock staff. You'll get everything you need."

His tone stayed even as he added, "After you recover, you're free to walk out whenever you want."

"You... You're holding me here against my wil!!" Hannah spat, her breath coming fast, anger crackling in every word.

Vincent hesitated, knowing there was no easy fix for her resentment. She needed time to accept this. "You should get some rest," he said quietly.

He made his way to the door. Hannah's voice cut through the silence, brittle with displeasure. "You never cared about what I wanted. Not before, not now. You just make all the choices and expect me to follow."

Vincent's gaze fell to the floor. As expected, she hated him for this arrangement. "Believe whatever you like," he muttered.

He lingered at the doorway, eyes tracing her outline, unwilling to leave but unable to stay. At last, he slipped out and closed the door behind him.

For days after, Hannah isolated herself, ignoring anyone who tried to speak to her and tossing aside every cup of medicine left on her bedside table.

Vincent kept his distance, watching her through the cold, flickering feed of the security camera. He'd deliberately vanished from her daily life, hoping a little space might soften her defiance. Instead, she only grew more withdrawn.

With a worried tone, Dr. Claire Morgan, the psychologist, raised a serious concern. "If Ms. Scott stays cooped up in her room much longer, I'm afraid she'll sink into depression."

Without warning, Vincent spun on his heel and headed for the door. "She's my wife," he declared over his shoulder, his tone low and unwavering.

The caregivers and Claire traded uneasy looks.

Vincent marched straight into Hannah's room. Without hesitation, he lifted her and carried her out into the sunroom, settling her carefully onto a lounge chair. "The doctor says you need sunlight," he murmured,tucking a blanket around her.

Hannah remained silent.

He reached for the medicinal brew a caregiver had just delivered. "I know you don't want me here. But you've been refusing your medicine, so I'm going to make sure you take it this time."

Vincent gently blew across the surface of the steaming liquid and then brought a spoonful to her lips.Hannah clamped her mouth shut, refusing to cooperate, her stubbornness unmistakable.

"This will help get rid of the blood clots in your brain," he explained gently, bringing the spoon a little closer,his patience holding even as her resistance remained.

Vincent's eyes turned cold. "There's only so much patience I have," he muttered, his voice flat as stone.

In the next instant, he took a measured sip of the bitter medicine, seized her face in his hand, and pressed his mnouth to hers, forcing her lips apart in one swift motion.

The caregivers nearby instantly averted their gazes.

The sharp,medicinal taste spilled over Hannah's tongue. Startled and furious, she clutched the open collar of his shirt, her fingers curling around the loose fabric."YOU-"

The warmth of the medicine spread through her mouth as his tongue pushed it in, the bitterness mingling with the faint, crisp scent clinging to his collar.

She bit down on his lip, hard enough to draw blood. Metallic warmth mingled with the medicine as it slid down her throat.

Their mouths finally broke apart. Hannah lashed out, swinging for his face, but her palm landed uselessly against his chest. "You bastard!" she growled, breathless.

Vincent seized her flailing hand with a swift, practiced grip, one eyebrow arching in faint amusement. "So you finally speak after all?"

Some part of him was relieved-at least she still had fight left in her. For days, he'd worried she'd gone withdrawn completely and lost the ability to speak.

Hannah scowled, her lips drawn tight as she wiped the bitter taste from her mouth with the back of her hand. "Who told you to use your mouth?"

Vincent's lips curved into a faint smile. "You wouldn't drink it, so I had to take matters into my own hands.Want me to do it again?"

Hannah clamped her lips together, exasperated, and then thrust out a hand. Vincent immediately pressed the bowl into her palm.

She finished the rest in one fierce gulp, grimacing as the bitterness burned down her throat.

Before she could complain, Vincent slipped a piece of candy between her lips. "This will help with the aftertaste," he said in a gentle tone.
###Chapter 213 Her Medicine Was Tempered With


Hannah kept searching for an escape, but the medical staff always seemed to be watching her. Coupled with her blindness, her desire to run away gradually faded, replaced by a reluctant acceptance of her recovery at this place.

One major reason for her change of heart was Vincent's absence. He barely showed himself at all. She went for days without even hearing his voice.

Slowly, she came to understand that since Vincent kept his distance, there was no need to resist the treatment.Now, her recovery took priority. Healing her eyes became the only thing that mattered.

Unbeknownst to her, Vincent was never really far away. He spent most of his time upstairs, hidden away in the monitoring room. He had shifted his corporate duties to remote management.

On a quiet afternoon, Hannah decided to wander out to the garden, tapping her cane along the gravel.Suddenly, she lost her balance and landed hard on her knee. Vincent, having seen this on the monitor,immediately left an international meeting to rush to her side. As soon as he noticed the blood trickling down her knee, his expression turned grim. Those caregivers had failed in their duty to tend to her.

Recognizing his footsteps, Hannah looked in his direction. "You hardly ever show up. What brings you here today?"

Vincent helped her to the nearest bench, barely looking at her as he said, "Had some business to take care of.That's all."

He fetched the first aid kit without another word and knelt to clean her wound. Hannah jerked away and murmured, "I don't need you to do this. The medical staff can handle it."

Without replying, Vincent kept treating her knee. He left as soon as he finished, disappearing before she could say anything else.

Once he left, Hannah felt much more at ease.
It was only much later that she learned Vincent had docked all caregivers' salaries for the entire month.

After that, the caregivers were almost too attentive, hovering around her in a way that left her feeling awkward and uneasy.


···

A full week had passed since Hannah began her medication, and Marie ran a test on Hannah to assess the progress of clearing the blood clot.

Marie sighed. "There hasn't been the slightest improvement in removing the clot. It's time we switched to a different prescription."

A wave of disappointment washed over Hannah. She resignedly accepted that regaining her vision would be no quick victory. Patience, it seemed, would have to become her constant companion for this slow road ahead.She released a quiet sigh.

To prepare a new prescription, Marie took the concoction the caregivers had brewed for Hannah.

She didn't suspect anything amiss at first, but when a peculiar scent drifted up, she paused in confusion.That odd smell raised an alarm. The medicine had clearly been tampered with.

Night settled over the whole place by the time Marie sought Vincent out, delivering the latest results in person.

Vincent's demeanor shifted instantly, his eyes cold. "How could it have no effect at all?"

"Don't worry, Mr. Jones. I've already written up a new prescription for your wife." Marie hesitated before adding, "But I need to ask-have you been keeping something from me?"

Confused, Vincent frowned at her, his gaze intense.

Marie's words tumbled out quickly, nerves getting the better of her. "I found traces of contraceptives in her medicine. I thought you'd ordered the caregivers to add it.Contraceptive drugs are hormone-based and can easily interfere with treatment. If you don't want children, you should have informed me in advance so l could adjust the prescription while preserving its effectiveness..." planation only deepened the chill in Vincent's expression.

she could finish, Vincent turned on his heel and strode toward the staircase.

after, the butler gathered every caregiver in the main hall.

oice that brooked no argument, the butler asked, "Who tampered with Mrs. Jones' medicine?"

ng onto the sofa, Vincent swept his icy gaze across the trembling staff, his patience clearly gone.

, coming up from behind, stared in shock and covered her mouth as she realized someone was erately trying to sabotage Hannah's recovery.

avy tension settled over the room, and Marie slipped out without making a sound.

caregivers looked at each other, uncertainty written on their faces, but nobody admitted to anything.

cent pointed at several caregivers who were visibly shaking.

ching on the silent command, the butler singled them out. "If you don't come clean, I'll have to get the ce involved. Drugging someone is a serious offense."

e threat worked, and the trembling caregivers, terrified, pointed at the one who had tampered with the dicine.

icent leaned forward, his face growing even more serious. "Who gave you the order to do this?"

th his intimidating voice hanging in the air, the frightened culprit broke down and revealed the identity of He held back his anger."Why shouldn't I be back?"

"That's not what I meant. I'm glad you're home." News had already reached Danica through Erica that Vincent and Hannah had been staying together at a villaoutside the city.

At first, Danica had been furious-she couldn't understand why a divorced couple would choose to live together. She'd tried visiting, but guards kept the gates closed to everyone, and she had to give up.

Judging fromm the way Vincent carried himself now, Danica guessed he must have had a fight with Hannah.A bit of satisfaction flickered in her eyes, happy to see him come back.

Masking her glee, she leaned in and asked, "Are you hungry? I can ask the kitchen to fix you a meal if you'd like."

Vincent ignored her question and stared her down."Is there anything you'd like to tell me?"
###Chapter 214 A Confrontation Between Mother And Son


Danica indeed had something to tell Vincent, but her courage failed at the last second. "It's late. We can talk tomorrow morning," she said quietly.

Vincent didn't budge, his expression dark. "No. We're having this conversation right now."

"Fine. Just let me grab something first." Danica paused, slipped back to her room and returned with a small stack of photographs.

She fanned the photos 'out across the table. "Here, Vincent. Last time, you took the albums without saying a word. I figured none of them interested you, so I picked out new ones myself. These women have good backgrounds, decent personalities, and they're all attractive. See anyone you like?"

An even deeper scowl crossed Vincent's face. With one swift movement, he ripped the photos to pieces and let them flutter to the floor.

Danica's voice rose, her frustration showing. "Seriously? You could've just said no! There's no need to destroy them."

His eyes were hard and unyielding. "I expected you had something important to say, not another round of matchmaking."

A jolt of fluster made Danica's heart skip. "Important? Like what, exactly?" Danica's hands twisted nervously, her nerves fraying. She'd indeed bribed a caregiver to slip infertility drugs into Hannah's medication the moment she learned Vincent and Hannah lived under the same roof.Searching for a way out, her mind scrambled for any excuse that might save her.

Words from the bottom of her heart tumbled out before she could stop herself. "Vincent, I swear,everything I did was for your sake. Hannah's your ex now. You two shacking up together? I was worried she'd get pregnant,tie you down again, and make us look bad in front of everyone."

A cold laugh escaped Vincent. "For me? That's the story you always tell. Honestly, I'm tired of hearing it."Shadows settled on his face. "When have you ever done anything for me?"

Resentment had become a permanent fixture in Vincent's heart whenever he thought of Danica. No matter what she claimed, her choices always benefited her first.

He couldn't forget the time Brinley's brother and father passed away after saving him. Danica had forced him to kneel on their doorstep for hours, even though he had only been a shaken seven-year-old. All the while, she'd disappeared with friends, enjoying their card games. Sharon had been the one who stepped forward and brought him home.

Later on, when his father died and the Jones Group's stocks plummeted, Danica, eager to distance herself from the chaos, had jetted off abroad with Brinley. The worst part? Danica had deliberately left before her own husband's funeral, her hasty packing just for skipping the ceremony.

At that time, since Sharon was bedridden, Vincent, just sixteen then, had bitterly realized that he had no one but himself to rely on to keep the family business afloat. He couldn't afford to break down despite the overwhelming stress on his shoulders.

And those women Danica had set up for him? She'd only considered how his marriage would reflect on her,never the couple's compatibility or his happiness. Brinley, along with every other so-called suitable candidate, had only met her standards of making her look good in the upper society.

Thus, either before or after he married Hannah, who hailed from an ordinary background, Danica had managed to make Hannah's life miserable at every turn, insisting on her own standards and never once asking what he wanted. Selfishness seemed to come as naturally to Danica as breathing.
When Vincent finally spoke, his words landed like a slap. "You only know how to look after your own interests."

Danica's cheeks burned, stung by his accusation. "So now you're picking a fight with your mother in the middle of the night, just to take Hannah's side?"

"That's exactly what I'm doing," Vincent replied, his voice cold and unwavering. "Tell me. Those first few months after Hannah and I got married and lived in this house-did you also slip infertility drugs into Hannah's meals?"

Danica didn't back down. Her voice grew sharp. "And if I did? She was never good enough to bear your child." She glared at him. "That girl comes from nothing. She would never gain my recognition. She doesn't have the status, and she sure as hell isn't worthy of bearing an her for the Jones family. I couldn't just stand by and let her taint our family's bloodline."

Hearing those words, Vincent's eyes flew wide. The raw truth struck him hard, and he had been oblivious the whole time until now. He met her gaze with steady conviction. "I chose Hannah myself. Grandma gave her blessing. Hannah never played any dirty games or wormed her way into my bed with underhanded tricks.How does that make her unworthy of bearing my child?"

Vincent's words pierced Danica's heart with each syllable. Every single word was meant to mock her.

After all, Danica had fought her way into the Jones family by manipulating every situation she could,including drugging Vincent's father, playing dirty to sleep with him, and getting herself pregnant for a shotgun marriage. Post-marriage, she had gotten the lifestyle she wanted, but real love was never part of her plan.

Danica's cheeks flushed with anger. "How dare you talk about your own mother like that?"

He gave a short, cold laugh. "Mother? I don't consider you a mother at all."

Vincent made for the door, ready to leave, but Danica's phone started ringing, her brother's name flashing on the screen. A late-night call indicated something was amiss.

She answered the phone quickly and, upon hearing her brother's words, she rushed to intercept Vincent."Your uncle needs your help. Go take care of it." Vincent retorted without hesitation,"NO."
###Chapter 215 She Knew About It All Along


Softening her tone, Danica acted as though their earlier argument had never taken place. "Vincent, your uncle's business is in trouble. All it would take is a phone call from you to straighten things out. He's family and that company's still part of the Jones Group."

A sharp glare flashed in Vincent's eyes. "You've got a lot of nerve bringing that up. If you hadn't forced my hand, none of this would've happened. The company wouldn't be his, and the Jones Group wouldn't be the punchline to everyone's jokes."

No warmth lingered in Vincent's expression as he watched her.

Words dried up in Danica's throat, but the memory of her brother's desperate phone call drove her to push on.She edged closer, her voice pleading. "Vincent, please, we're talking family here. Are you really going to stand by and watch your uncle's company get shut down? His whole family depends on him."

He didn't blink. "You've got it wrong. They're not counting on him. They've always counted on you. All the money you've siphoned off to your side of the family? You actually thought Grandma and I didn't notice?"

A cold laugh escaped her. "What, so my family suddenly doesn't matter to you now? We're supposed to be one and the same."

"Grandma is the only family member I care about. The rest don't matter111Vincent replied, his mouth twisting in distaste.

Shock overtook Danica's face at his harsh words. "How dare you talk like that?"

Without hesitation, Vincent moved for the door. "I'm not lifting a finger for him. His company's got flammable materials stacked up, and people died because of shoddy production. It got reported."

Danica opened her mouth to make one last effort, but Vincent didn't give her the chance. "I'm the one who reported it."

Her skin turned pale as the truth hit. "You reported your uncle?" Everything suddenly made sense- Vincent's late-night return and furious confrontation. "So this is all about Hannah, isn't it?"

"Consider it a lesson for you," Vincent replied, his tone unyielding. "Cross the line again, and I won't hold back."

Danica's audacity in slipping the contraceptive drugs into Hannah's food and medication to keep her from getting pregnant was something Vincent would never forgive.

With a sharp motion, Vincent swung open the car door and hurled a parting shot over his shoulder."1fyour brother means that much to you, then move out of this place. I'll explain to Grandma for you."

Danica's hands trembled with fury. "You! You're nothing but an ungrateful child! All those years, wasted on raising you!"

"Raising a kid means pouring in time and love. You only gave birth to me, but you never raised me," Vincent replied, his voice unflinching. In his heart, Sharon was the one whno'd truly brought him up.

A squeal of tires marked Vincent's exit as he sped off into the night.

Left standing alone, Danica pressed her hand to her chest, a cold pallor settling over her face.

From the shadows, Erica lingered just out of sight, having overheard every barbed word exchanged. She had egged Danica on to drug Hannah, never guessing Vincent would figure it out so quickly or that he would side with Hannah so decisively. Nothing about the situation had unfolded as Erica hoped.

Stepping out, Erica approached Danica, her words soft and soothing, though they did little to help.

···
At the villa in Mapleridge, Vincent rolled in past three in the morning. He didn't go upstairs to his room like he usually did. Instead, he walked quietly into Hannah's room.

He stood near her bed, staring at her sleeping face in silence. He didn't turn to leave until the first hint of dawn crept in through the curtains.

When morning arrived, Hannah immediately sensed something had shifted. The usual caregivers were nowhere to be found, having been replaced overnight. She brought it up with the butler, who gave a half-
hearted reply about some being dismissed for pulling off some tricks or not pulling their weight.

Later on, as Hannah moved through the garden, tapping carefully with her cane, a sharp trace of Vincent's cologne drifted into her nostrils. Unable to see, she played it off like she didn't notice.

But he didn't let the moment slide. He called out to her.

Hannah kept her tone steady as she replied, "What brings you out here?"

A weight lingered in Vincent's eyes as he spoke. "Marie prescribed you new meds."

"I know." A question hovered on Hannah's mind, prompting her to tilt her head. "If my vision never returns,do you intend to keep me trapped here forever?"

A faint parting of Vincent's lips signaled hesitation. "That's not what I want."

Hannah stiffened, left uncertain whether he meant her eyes would heal or he wouldn't keep her caged. No urge compelled her to dig deeper for clarity.

Vincent's stare grew intense. After a long pause, he said softly, "I'm sorry."

Hannah's hand stilled on her cane, a faint smirk tugging at her lips."Anapology doesn't cut it. I'm not forgiving you for keeping me captive here."

A dry rasp colored Vincent's next words, emotion catching in his throat."My mother..." He faltered, voice cracking. "She had your meals and medication laced with infertility drugs. I can't tell you how sorry l am."

A short, almost bitter laugh left Hannah. "So that's what you apologized for."

Shock rippled across Vincent's features. "You already knew?"

"Of course," she answered, her tone cold and distant.

Danica's cruelty had never come as a surprise to Hannah. A few years back, even after Hannah had packed her things and left the Jones family estate behind, Danica had still found ways to slip contraceptive drugs into her meals. She had skipped every tainted meal and confronted Danica, drug analysis report in hand.

However, Danica had brushed Hannah off without a care and counted on Vincent never listening to Hannah's calls. And she wasn't wrong. Vincent hadn't bothered to pick up a single call.

Back then, Hannah had been shattered. But now, she felt a strange kind of freedom.

"Why didn't you tell me?" Vincent asked, his voice tight and hoarse.

Hannah responded coldly, "What difference would it have made?"
###Chapter 216 Try My Eyes


A tight ache twisted in Vincent's chest at the way Hannah held herself, so composed that it almost seemed cold. When he finally spoke, his voice cracked with a desperation he hadn't meant to reveal. "I could have defended you and made my mother pay for ever tampering with your meals. I swear | would-"

The vow-"I would stand with you, no matter what"-was on the tip of his tongue, but he couldn't get it out.All the old wounds he'd inflicted on her came rushing up, choking off his words.

Before he could recover, Hannah's calm voice slipped between them, gentle but unyielding. "And then? You would end up fighting with your mother, caught in pain and anger, maybe even a complete break?"

Everything that had happened last night, she predicted it all.Vincent forced down the lump in his throat,silent.

Hannah's composure never faltered."Vincent, it's pointless. Arguments, rifts, punishment-none of it can undo what's already been done. My body's broken, and my spirit's scarred. There's no undoing it."

A dry, bitter laugh slipped from her lips. "Telling you? What difference would it have made? What was the point of discussing it now?"

"At the very least, you wvouldn't have to go through it alone." Vincent's reply was rough-edged, a faint quiver betraying the storm beneath his calm.

She thought of all those endless, sleepless nights-the gnawing depression, the crushing weight of forced infertility-everything she'd suffered behind closed doors, while the man she called husband remained oblivious. The irony stung.

"I faced the worst of it on my own. Anger, resentment, hatred-I've made it through all of that." Hannah drew a careful breath, her tone unshaken. "I've already embraced that Chapter of my life. Your reaction now only makes it hard for me."

Vincent's gaze dropped, shadowed by regret.
Hannah drew a steady breath and tipped her chin up, defiant. "I've long given up on you. I see everything for what it is now. I don't waste time on impossible hopes-like fitting into your family, or thinking you'd finally break free from your mother and stand up for me. Letting go of those illusions? That's what set me free.Walking away from you, from the Jones family-that was the best choice I have ever made."

Her words landed like iron against his chest, each one leaving a bruise. After a long silence, he managed a hoarse, "I'm sorry."

His voice was rough, as if the words scraped his throat. For all their weight, they still felt hollow and insignificant.

"Since I lost my sight, every day has been suffocating. The darkness swallowed me whole. Just because l was strong doesn't mean I was unaffected, especially... Being imprisoned by you pulled me straight into the worst memoriesof our marriage."

A chill ran through Hannah's smile, leaving it hollow and emotionless. "If you really feel sorry, then set me free. Everything that ever existed between us is already over for me. Clinging to the past just throws my life into chaos. I can't stand it."

Hannah's calmness built an impenetrable wall between them-more effectively than any outburst of anger could have. Her quiet detachment shut him out of her world completely.

Vincent's reply was barely more than a whisper. "I understand."

He decided to let her go.

But by then, Hannah was already gone-her heart far beyond his reach.

···

Nearly two weeks had passed since she moved in. Though she'd settled into the rhythm of this new life, a constant ache tugged her back toward the world she'd left behind. She missed the comforts of her old routihe-her family's warmth, the chatter of close friends, the sense of purpose her work gave her. That was where she belonged.

But every attempt to reach out was barred. The excuse was always the same: contact could compromise her safety, drawing danger to her doorstep.

With no room for argument, Hannah could only swallow her frustration and obey.

Day after day, the monotony of recovery pressed in, each hour blurring into the next.

Vincent watched from a distance, silent and ever-present. Since that difficult conversation, he'd kept his distance, leaving her alone in the quiet that now defined her days.

Marie returned with a fresh update, her face brightening as she shared the good news: the blood clot in Hannah's brain had finally dissolved.

Vincent pressed his fingers to his temples, frustration simmering beneath his calm. "Then why hasn't her vision come back?"

Marie answered without hesitation, "That's what concerns me. The explosion might've damaged more than just her brain. There's a chance her eyes were injured as weIl. For her vision to recover, she might need a retinal transplant surgery."

She paused and then added, "I've already uploaded her medical details to the transplant registry. The moment a matching donor appears, we'll get the call."

Everything had been arranged with meticulous care.

Vincent looked up, his voice quiet but urgent. "How long will it take?"

Marie gave him the hard truth. "It could be as little as six months. Or it might take three years."

Vincent leaned in and murmured, "That's too long to wait." The wait would be unbearable to Hannah.

Marie replied quietly,"Six months is already fast. Some people wait their entire lives."

A heavy silence settled between them.

Vincent suddenly spoke."Try my eyes."

Marie froze and then gently reminded him,"Mr. Jones, you really need to reconsider this. If you're a match and the transplant goes ahead, you won't be able to have another surgery anytime soon. You'd be blind for at least three years."

Vincent let out a soft, self-mocking laugh. "Three years? That's nothing." It was still shorter than the five years he and Hannah had spent as husband and wife.

With a cautious tone, she pressed on. "Mr. Jones, please know that the risks are substantial."

Vincent gave a humorless smile. "Risks? It's a risk I must take." He turned on his heel and added over his shoulder, "Just see if the match aligns first."

Marie doubted they'd match. What were the odds?

Three days later, the test results arrived. To Marie's astonishment, it showed that Vincent and Hannah were an exceptionally rare match. The chances of rejection were almost nonexistent. Vincent's retina could be transplanted to Hannah.

Quiet and unwavering, Vincent gave his only instruction. "Don't tell her."

The surgery was set for a month out.
###Chapter 217 Hlis Hidden Motives


News from Marie brought an unexpected burst of joy to Hannah. The blood clot in her mind had finally dissolved, clearing the way to have retinal surgery in just a month. Finally, there was progress in her eye treatment.

Waves of relief crashed through Hannah as she listened. It meant she'd be out of this place one month later.Hope had stirred inside her for the first time in what felt like ages.

Not everything changed for the better, though. Vincent started turning up by her side nearly every single day. Silent most of the time, he simply lingered nearby-watchful, yet saying nothing at all.

One day,without warning, Vincent showed up carrying a pile of Braille books in his arms. When Hannah's fingers swept across the covers, she turned to the caregiver and asked, "Are these for me?"

A light laugh slipped out of Vincent."NO,not for you," he said.

Mentally, Hannah couldn't help but scoff. She hadn't asked him. Why did he answwer her question? And who else would need Braile books here besides her? The idea that the books might be for someone else was laughable.

Actually, Vincent didn't lie. He'd brought those books for himself. With no one suitable to step in and take the reins of the Jones Group, he had begun preparing for the worst-case scenario. If blindness ever came for him post-surgery, he still needed to keep the company running.

Reading Braille became his fallback plan, just in case he ever had to review confidential reports or balance sheets without relying on anyone else. He'd thought things through. If he ever went blind, he would vanish abroad under the excuse of business, so nobody suspected he couldn't see.

Yet, the idea that this month might be the last time he would ever be near Hannah haunted him. That fear pushed him to hover in her presence these limited days as much as possible.

Thus, these days, caregivers often caught Vincent by Hannah's side. Questions about Hannah's
whereabouts had become routine-Vincent would quietly ask and then trail after her without a word,blending into the background.

This evening was no exception. Finished with paperwork, Vincent dropped into the seat beside Hannah, his fingers tracing Braille letters with intense concentration.

Restlessness gnawed at Hannah, who did her best to pretend he wasn't there. Silence hung between them until she finally broke. "Why're you so into learning Braille anyway?"

Letting herself get sentimental over his sudden interest in Braille wasn't part of her plan. She wouldn't be moved because of this.

A sly edge crept into Vincent's tone as he leaned closer. "How did you know..."

If it were in the past, Hannah would have pulled away from his advances, but being temporarily unable to see,she had no clue he'd inched toward her and stayed where she was.

Boldness pushed Vincent to close the gap between them further until barely any space remained, their faces nearly touching, though he dared not go further.

Hannah didn't respond to his question. She could tell from the rustle of pages and his focused vibe. And just now, she'd pickedup his quiet footsteps, his presence growing even more obvious. Instinct made her lean back, putting a little distance between them.

Vincent noticed her reaction, a trace of annoyance slipping through his face. Fixing his gaze on her, he asked, "Want to try reading it?"

Without skipping a beat, Hannah answered, "I'll pass."

Persistence filled Vincent's voice. "Come on. Just give it a shot." He didn't wait for approval, sliding next to her and wrapping his arms around her.

Hannah squirmed, swatting at him. "Back off."

Vincent stated in a serious tone, "I'm trying to teach you Braille."

He placed his hand over hers, guiding her finger so she could feel the pattern ofraised dots along the paper.

Hannah felt uneasy with him being so close, so she sprang to her feet. "I don't need to learn this," she said.

Vincent kept his eyes on the floor. "I know," he said quietly. He remembered her upcoming surgery. She wouldn't need Braille.

With her cane in hand, Hannah turned away and began walking off.

Vincent called out after her, "The word you just touched? That was Scott."

Hannah kept going and did not look back.

Vincent tried again. "Your last name."

She didn't pause, walking away without responding.

He let his fingers rest on the page, head lowered. He could feel disappointment settle inside him. The first word he'd ever learned to read in Braille had been her name. But she couldn't care less about it.Or him.


···

Since that episode, Vincent eased up on his watch over Hannah. She finally got the chance to talk to her parents.

Inside the sunroom, a caregiver stepped in to help her make the call.

Hannah spilled the news about her surgery, and they were more nervous than she was.

After the call, the caregiver took the phone away.

Hannah sensed Vincent was nearby and couldn't help but comment deliberately, "What's the harm with letting a blind person keep her phone? Taking my phone away this quickly? You're making this way more dramatic than it needs,to be."

Vincent's expression did not change. "It's better to be careful," he replied. Even then, his nerves would not settle. His team still had no leads on whoever had brought Hannah up to that hospital rooftop weeks earlier.
Hannah pressed her lips together, soaking up the sun to kill time.

Vincent leaned over and asked her, "Are you bored?"

With clear irritation, Hannah retorted, "Isn't that obvious?" She waved him away. "Go study Braille and quit bothering me."

Vincent refused to move and made himself comfortable next to her. "How about I fill you in on what's happening with your company?"

Hannah's eas perked up, alarm bells ringing. "What's going on with my company?"

He kept his eyes on her. "Nothing serious. Just a few things I thought you'd want to know about."

She stretched her hand out. "Give me my phone. I'll check for myself."

He shook his head. "That's not happening. Either let me tell you, or you can keep sitting here, bored. The choice is yours."

Hannah had no real options. She had been desperate for updates on how her company was doing,especially Polaris Tech's gaming projects. She let out a breath. "Fine. Go on."

Vincent jumped right in, sharing the glowing feedback on the Nova Tech wristband and highlighting the major progress made with Polaris Tech's gaming projects. He laid it out clearly, tossing in his own sharp insights.

Every idea he brought up seemed to fit with what Hannah had imagined for the company's future. She found herself pulled into the discussion, even offering her own thoughts here and there.

This marked the first time she'd ever talked business with Vincent, and his sharp business sense took her by surprise. He was more than capable-he knew how to cut through complications with real precision.

Finally, Hannah said, "Thank you."

He didn't hesitate to ask, "If you really want to thank me, come out with me tomorrow." ###Chapter 218 Cemetery


Hannah leaned back and let her irritation show. "Then I'll take my gratitude back."

Vincent's gaze was locked on her. "Just think of it as getting some fresh air."

Vincent's thoughts wandered to the plans for tomorrow, and a shadow flashed through his eyes.

She tried to set boundaries. "I don't mind getting some air, but I'II go by myself."

A frown appeared on Vincent's face. "That's not happening."

With a sharp laugh, Hannah dismissed him. "Then don't even think about making me go." She had no desire to be alone with him.

Vincent said nothing, his gaze steady, and he let the matter rest for now.

But the next day, as Vincent was about to head out, he saw Hannah fumbling around the yard with her cane.His resolve hardened, and he forcefully pulled her toward the car.

Amid her struggle, her cane slipped from her grip, and panic washed over her.

Without missing a beat, Vincent picked up the cane and placed it in her hand, letting her catch her breath.

His movements softened as he carried her toward the car and gently settled her inside it. He had picked a stretch Lincoln so she would feel comfortable during the ride.

She figured out she was inside the car and snapped, "You're forcing me again!"

Vincent pulled a blanket over her lap. "This is the last time," he remarked.

Hannah leaned back, stubbornly turning her face away.

Although Vincent didn't say more, he kept glancing her way as the car moved on.

Time seemed to drag until finally, the car came to a stop. Vincent guided Hannah out of the car.
Hannah's heart started pounding in the unfamiliar setting. She clung to her cane and asked, "Where are we?"

Vincent answered simply, "We're at the cemetery."

Confusion crept across her face. "Why did you bring me to a cemetery all of a sudden?"

"Today is the anniversary of my father's death."

His words came out heavy and quiet. He longed for one last moment with his father before he might lose his own sight. And he wanted nothing more than to have Hannah by his side for this.

Hannah went quiet. Back when they were together, whether dating or married, Vincent always clammed up whenever she asked about his dad. Now, post-divorce, here he was, bringing her to his father's resting place. She nearly laughed at the irony but managed to keep her tone level. "We're not together anymore.I shouldn't be here."

Vincent dropped his gaze. "Just this once."

"No." Turning away, Hannah made for the car.

Vincent let her go without protest.

But once inside the vehicle, she realized the driver was fast asleep, snoring for all the world to hear.Now that she had lost her sight, every little sound felt magnified to her.

Barely two mninutes later, she stepped out of the car.

As she stood next to the vehicle, a faint noise caught her attention. Without thinking, she gripped her cane tightly and moved toward the stone steps. In that moment of fear, even being near Vincent, who usually got on her nerves, didn't seem so bad.

She inched forward carefully, but when her foot missed a step, her body pitched forward, off balance.

Vincent's arms caught her around the waist, drawing her in close. His voice rumbled right beside her ear."Careful!"
Reflexively, Hannah tried to pull away and nearly lost her footing again, but Vincent held her steady.

A moment later, she found her balance once more.

Vincent did not ask what changed her mind. Instead, he took hold of her wrist and led her up the steps,patient and unhurried.

He didn't ask, and Hannah didn't explain.

Eventually,they made it to a section of the cemetery. To their surprise, a few people were already waiting.

Vincent locked eyes with Erica and Danica.

"Vincent," Danica said, squeezing out a few fake tears. She'd known Vincent would visit his dad's grave today and had come early to see him.

Hannah recognized Danica's voice right away, and a knot tightened in her stomach.

Vincent's face was unreadable. "I don't want a fight in front of my father's grave."

Danica's eyes were red-rimmed, her voice shaky with calculated emotions. "I've been crying nonstop since you left, Vincent. I know I messed up." She turned to Hannah. "You came too, Hannah. I want to apologize I'm sorry for what I did. I never should have slipped those infertility drugs to you. Please forgive me." She clutched Hannah's hand, sounding seemingly sincere.

A wave of revulsion ran through Hannah, and she quickly pulled her hand away, her expression turning cold.

It was clear to Hannah that Danica's sudden apology was only because Vincent had confronted her abou the drugs.

Without hesitation, Vincent stepped in front of Hannah, his voice firm. "Keep your hands off her."

His words stunned Danica, and Erica shifted uncomfortably, a sour feeling twisting in her gut.

Hannah wiped her hand, her expression blank as a slate.

Vincent's tone stayed hard. "If you really felt bad, you wouldn't be waiting here for me. This is all abou wanting me to step in for your brother,right?"
Her motives exposed, Danica faltered for a bit and then broke down in tears, hoping to sway Vincent."Vincent, his company's been seized, and now he's in custody. He's your uncle, almost sixty years old, for Christ's sake! How can you just let him rot in jail?"

A cold look settled on Vincent's face. "How does it concern me in any way? He brought this upon himself."

Danica dropped to her knees, desperate. "I'm begging you, Vincent. If your dad were still around, he would never want this..."

Vincent narrowed his eyes and cut her off. "Don't you dare mention my father's name! You really think I don't know how he died?"

Hannah's heart skipped with surprise, though she kept her expression neutral.

Danica went still, her voice trembling. "N-no. It's not me. I never hurt your father."

Her eyes darted away, avoiding Vincent's piercing stare.

Vincent's gaze was cold as steel. "You know the truth better than I do."
###Chapter 219 Why Get Married


Vincent stared straight at Danica, his tone colder than winter. "All these years, you have never once shown up for my father's death anniversary. Now, the moment your family runs into trouble, you appear without delay. This is nothing short of disrespecting his memory."

Erica chimed in, trying to ease the tension, "Vincent, we're all family. Don't be so harsh. Danica was just anxious and let her emotions get the better of her."

He cut the conversation short. "I've said my piece. You can leave now."

Taking Hannah by the hand, Vincent guided her past them toward a worn gravestone.

Danica's voice erupted behind him. "You're really just going to walk away from your own mother?"

Vincent stayed silent and never looked back.

Danica almost protested again, but Erica quickly stopped her with a shake of the head. They finally left the cemetery.

Vincent dropped to one knee and carefully brushed the dust from the grave.

Hannah clung to her cane, a storm of questions in her mind. After a moment's pause, she remarked,"YOU parents-"

But she swallowed the rest, knowing it was pointless. Vincent never opened up about this stuff.

He kept his eyes on his father's gravestone and said nothing.

Just as she expected, he stayed quiet. She didn't feel surprised at all.

Then, out of the blue, Vincent broke the silence, his voice low as he kept looking at the gravestone."M parents' reunion was nothing more than a shotgun marriage. As far back as I can remember, there was neve any love between them."
Memories darkened his mood. "When I was sixteen, the company was slammed by a smear campaign. My father was bedridden. Mom fired everyone, letting him miss the critical window for treatment. He died of a heart attack. She's why he's gone, but she didn't even show up for his funeral."

A strange calm stayed in his voice.

A wave of sadness washed over Hannah. Even though Vincent spoke simply, the weight of his parents' failed marriage was impossible to ignore. Everything about their relationship had led to disaster. She could not help but ask, "If there wasn't any love between them, what made them get married at all?"

That question lingered in her mind, along with another-maybe loveless marriages were just how things worked for the Jones family. But she kept that thought to herself.

Vincent's tone grew quieter. "The Jones family always cared more about appearances than anything else."

Hannah bowed her head, questions piling up in her mind. What about her? Vincent never loved her,and they didn't have a child before marriage, yet he'd dated and married her. But they had already split up, so maybe the reason was meaningless now.

Still, eight years was no small ###Chapter. Not a lifetime, but not a quick mistake either. She needed answers for those eight years. She could not let their story end without answers.

"Vincent," she said, her voice even.

He rose, turned, and looked at her sideways.

Hannah squared her shoulders and asked him, "Why'd you marry me back then? You didn't love me either."

A shadow crossed Vincent's eyes, and his brow drew tight at the question.

She waited for an answer. When he finally spoke, his words hung heavy in the air."At the time, it just felt like you were the right fit."

Hannah stood completely still, uncertain if he was simnply brushing her off. Anyone could see that Vincent had the money and charm to choose anyone he wanted from the high society. In contrast, she came from an ordinary background, so how did that make her a suitable fit for him?
Heat built in her chest. "If you don't wanna say, just say so. Don't feed me some half-baked excuse."

"I'm not-" Vincent moved a step closer, picking up on her anger. He swallowed, nerves tightening his throat. A quiet moment stretched before he spoke in a gentler voice. "Grandma liked you."

Hannah's whole body tensed, and her reply was quick and sharp. "So that's it? You married me because your grandma liked me?"

Vincent's gaze shifted away, landing somewhere distant. He gave a quiet yep.
Thoughts raced through Hannah's mind, and she began to understand what he meant by"suitable fit." His grandmother's approval made her seem like the perfect match, and that was all it took for him to marry her.

This wasn't exactly a shock, but she had never expected the reason to be so simple. It explained why he'd pushed for remarriage a few times, all for Sharon's benefit.

If she could see him now, she would be scrutinizing him, since she realized she might never have truly known him. He never seemed willing to open up or consider what he wanted from life. Even for something as significant as marriage, he prioritized his family's wishes. Sharon mattered to him, so her opinion was all that mattered.

As if double-checking, Hannah asked, "But what about you?"

A hint of confusion flickered in Vincent's eyes. "Me? What are you asking about me?"

Words tumbled out before she could stop them. "Didn't you ever wonder about what you want? What you feel and what you hope for. Don't they matter at all?"
###Chapter 220 Don't Rush Into Another Marriage


Vincent froze, genuinely startled by the question. Nobody had ever cared enough to ask him that.

His father, in his pursuit of grooming a perfect successor, had never allowed him to express any preferences or desires, so he had grown accustomed to suppressing his feelings.

His mother, even more relentless, orchestrated every aspect of his existence-his education, his career, and even his marriage-always chasing her own satisfaction, never sparing a thought for what he might want.

Vincent had never been taught to search for his own desires. The habit of ignoring his emotions was ingrained deeply. Appeasing his parents and keeping them content was the only way he knew how to survive their world wvithout sparking another round of bitter conflict.

Hannah's arrival in his world had been purely by chance. In the beginning, he'd found her presence jarring-he kept her at a distance, his demeanor icy and unwelcoming.

Yet,everything had shifted the day his grandmother, after a brief encounter with Hannah, took an immediate liking to her. Vincent had always cared deeply about his grandmother's opinions, so her approval lingered in his mind, slowly softening his attitude. He'd begun seeing Hannah differently and started dating her with marriage in mind.

As months passed, it'd become clear that Hannah was a rare find-someone who not only fit seamlessly into his life, but also earned his grandmother's unwavering affection. For him, that alone seemed to justify his decision to marry her.

Vincent paused, his voice barely above a whisper. "My feelings don't matter."

Hannah met his eyes, steady and sincere. "Your feelings matter. You're not some machine but a person with your own preferences and desires. If you ignore your own feelings, what's left of you? Isn't it your life, your marriage-not your grandmother's?"

Vincent's jaw clenched hard enough to ache. She was the first person to make him think about his own
feelings, the first to tell him what he felt actually mattered.

That idea ran counter to everything his father had ever taught him. Confusion and vulnerability flickered in his eyes. He stared at Hannah, struggling to form words, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed back a dozen unfinished sentences.

He finally said, his voice barely above a murmur,"My feelings really matter?" The words hovered between a question and an attempt at seeking confirmation.

Hannah met his gaze without wavering. "They do. More than you realizer′′she said, her tone gentle but unwavering.

Her words seemed to linger in the air, reverberating through him. He fell silent.

Unable to see, Hannah didn't catch his reply, and a flicker of regret crossed her mind for having spoken so candidly. Still, his decision to marry her solely based on assuming she was the right fit for him had caused her so much pain in their marriage over the years.

She couldn't keep it in any longer. "Here's a piece of unsolicited advice. If you continue to prioritize your grandmother's approval over your own feelings, don't rush into another marriage. You'll only end up hurting someone else again. Unless you learn to break that habit, you're not suited for marriage."

She'd lived the reality-she knew how suffocating that kind of marriage could be. Only now did she truly grasp why it had failed: the answer was both painfully obvious and maddeningly complex, yet in the end,she could finally draw a clean line beneath it. She felt at peace-there was nothing left for her to regret.

A shadow passed over Vincent's eyes as her words sank in. He hadn't meant to cause her pain, but the damage was done. His voice was a rough whisper. "I'm sorry..."

A heavy silence stretched between them before Hannah finally murmured, "Alright. I accept it."

Previously, she'd been unable to let go of the lies he'd spun around her life, but now, in the quiet shadow of the cemetery, she found herself able to forgive the stark truth he'd laid bare. This was the first time she'd truly acknowledged his apology-not just in passing, but with a clear heart. Maybe it was the somber weight of this place, or maybe it was the raw honesty he'd offered her at last. Whatever it was, she chose to let go.
For a moment, Vincent's gaze drifted, the world blurring at the edges.

Neither of them spoke.

After a pause, Hannah broke the hush. "Shall we go?" she asked quietly, her voice steady but spent.

Vincent's voice carried a quiet ache. "Let's stay a bi longer. We might not get another chance like this."

Hearing his words, Hannah felt a strange twinge in her chest-but she quickly suppressed it. "You can come by your father's gravestone whenever you feel like it," she replied, her tone cool and distant.

He offered a soft, resigned "Yeah."

After a moment, he added, "In a month, I'll let you go."
He lowered his gaze. One month left, and the last threads binding them would finally snap. All the pain and sadness he had caused her would vanish along with his departure. She would gradually forget him...

Unaware, Vincent's fingers curled in on themselves, tension flickering through his hand.

"Thank you," Hannah murmured, her voice low and gentle. She wasn't thanking him for the promise of freedom, but for ensuring she'd be receiving the best medical care. He'd been wrong to keep her captive.Setting her free was the only decent thing left to do.

Vincent's eyes lingered on her, unreadable and shadowed. One month later, she'd be back to her old life.
Once he left the country, their paths would never cross again. This visit to his father's gravestone was
nothing but a silent goodbye.

A long, loaded pause hung between them before Vincent reached for her wrist, his touch gentle but resolute. "Let's go. I'll take you back."

They moved through the quiet together, neither speaking, each tangled in their own thoughts.

Hannah navigated every step with careful deliberation, while Vincent replayed her earlier words over and over in his mind.

As they drew near the car, Vincent spotted Erica standing beside it, arms folded and waiting. Vincent's brows drew together in a frown. "You're still here?"
###Chapter 221 Her Unguarded Joy


Erica's voice was gentle as she said to Vincent,"Your mother's already gone. I stayed because there's something I wanted to discuss with you."

She paused and then tossed out a question with practiced nonchalance. "So what kept you in the cemetery so long?"

Vincent avoided her eyes, answering simply, "We just talked for a bit."

Erica shifted her attention to Hannah, studying her carefully. "How are your eyes, Ms. Scott? I heard Vincent's brought in quite a few specialists to help."

Hannah kept her response crisp. "The surgery's set for next month."

A faint smile curved Erica's lips. "That's great news. Maybe now Vincent can stop torturing himself with guilt over your condition." She then changed the subject. "You've saved Vincent from a serious harm-I haven't even thanked you properly. Let me take you out for a meal sometime."

Hannah's reply was cool and direct. "That's not necessary. We're not that close."

Erica's smile faltered, a flash of awkwardness crossing her face.

Vincent, done with the conversation with Erica, gently guided Hannah toward the car and declared,′′Whave things to take care of. We'll be heading back now."

Before he could close the door, Erica quickly slid into the front passenger seat. "Mind giving me a lift? I just stuck my neck out for you and had a bit of a showdown with your mother."

Vincent's eyes dropped to the floor mats, but he didn't object. He indeed had something to discuss with Erica:

The limousine glided down the tree-lined avenue, Erica occasionally twisting around to make small talk with Vincent. He responded with little more than polite indifference, barely meeting her gaze. Erica noticed his lack of enthusiasm.

Soon, the limousine rolled to a stop in front of the villa.

Vincent quietly directed the caregivers to help Hannah out of the car, making sure they supported her every step. Meanwhile, Erica announced she wanted to step out of the car and have a good look at the place, but Vincent stopped her. "Erica, stay in the car. There's something I need to discuss with you."

With just the two of them left in the car, Erica felt a strange sense of excitement. Unable to hide her curiosity, she slid from the front passenger seat to join Vincent in the back. She flashed him a warm grin."It's easier to talk like this."

She angled her body toward him, eyes bright with anticipation."So, Vincent, what's on your mind?"

He hesitated for a moment, his expression unreadable. Then, in a low, steady voice,he finally said,'"In 0month, I'll be leaving the country."

A subtle smile tugged at the corner of Erica's mouth as she quickly asked, "Is it a work trip? Do you want me to come along?"

His answer was crisp. "It's not a business trip. This time, I'll be gone for quite a while."

Her eyes brightened with hope. "So you've got a tough deal to close? I could go with you-help however you need. For years, you've shouldered the company's burden alone while I was away and couldn't do anything.But now I'm back, Vincent. Let me share the burden. You don't have to do it alone anymore."

She seized on the idea, unwilling to pass up her chance to get along with him alone.

He blinked and looked down to hide the shift in his expression. "I'll be abroad for at least three years,maybe longer.What I really need is for you to look after my grandma while I'm away. That would help more than anything."

The news blindsided Erica. "Three years? Are you planning to move there for good?"

A faint crease appeared between Vincent's brows."Don't press for details. I have things sorted out. Just help me take care of my grandma," he said, his voice low. Erica failed to keep her emotions in check, and they slipped into her voice. "If you go abroad, what about the company?"

"I'll oversee things remotely," Vincent replied flatly.

A sharp intuition gnawed at Erica. "Vincent, are you hiding something from me?"

His face remained impassive, eyes distant. "No."

The silence between them stretched, thick with things left unsaid. At last, Vincent broke it. "I'll have the driver take you home."

Erica composed herself, offering a smile. "We're already here. Aren't you going to invite me in fo a bit?"

"Hannah needs peace and quiet. Now's not a good timne," Vincent replied, stepping out of the car and leaving Erica behind, her hopes wilting in the backseat.

Once Vincent walked inside, he caught sight of Hannah laughing as she played with the water, the caregivers close by. It had been ages since he'd seen such unguarded joy on her face. For a fleeting moment, he stood frozen, captivated by her radiance.

She truly was beautiful-he'd always known, but moments like this made it unmistakably clear once more.

Claire observed with a quiet smile. "She looks like she's in a great mood today."

Vincent couldn't take his eyes off Hannah. "You think so?"

Claire replied with a gentle nod, "Absolutely. You really should take her out more."

Vincent glanced down, his expression unreadable, shadows flickering in his eyes.

The cool splash of water brought relief from the summer heat, and Hannah's laughter carried on the breeze.If only she could see the sunlight sparkling on the water, it would have been even more wonderful.

Lost in her play, Hannah didn't notice someone creeping up behind her until she suddenly collided with a solid chest.

Vincent's presence made the caregivers quickly halt the water hoses. "What's going on?" Hannah asked, a hint of worry in her voice.

The contact caused Vincent's entire frame to tense, his breath catching as words abandoned him.He stepped back, dazed, and then quickly turned to leave.

Hannah blinked, confusion settling over her.
###Chapter 222 Back Off


After that day, Vincent couldn't shake the odd tension that swept through him whenever he was around Hannah. Therefore, he abandoned his original plan to stick to her side and instead barricaded himself in his top-floor suite, a self-imposed exile. He started avoiding face-to-face encounters, monitoring her movements through the ever-watchful security cameras.

Meanwhile, Hannah relished the sudden peace that came with Vincent's absence. She tossed him from her mind without a second thought.

One night, she went to bed early, only to be jolted awake at the crack of dawn by a sharp pain in her lower abdomen. A hot flush spilled out of her and soaked the sheets, and dread curled in her chest.She threw off the covers and slid from bed, panic nipping at her heels. She remembered stashing her sanitary pads in the second drawer of her wardrobe. Blindly, she edged forward,hands stretched out.

In her rush, her knee smacked hard against the cabinet's edge. The pain made her double over,clutching her leg with a stifled gasp.

Upstairs, Vincent's eyes were glued to the monitor,his jaw tightening as he watched Hannah's face contort with pain. Assuming she'd collided with something dangerous-maybe shattered glass-he didn't stop to reconsider. He sprang from his chair and charged for her room, urgency driving every step.

Still wincing, Hannah finally reached the drawer.Her fingertips found the cool metal handle just as the bedroom door banged open behind her, splintering the quiet.

"What's going on?" Vincent's voice rang out, low and sharp, but he stopped short the second he saw the scene before him. A wide, dark stain had blossomed across the bed, while Hannah knelt on the floor, herskin chalk-white. Scarlet streaked the hem of her silk nightgown, stark against the pale fabric.

His gaze fell lower-blood was trailing down her bare thigh. A flash of alarm shot through him, recalling the time she'd mentioned an episode of heavy bleeding.His expression turned grim, a muscle ticking in his jaw. What sort of illness could make her bleed like this?

Without a second thought, he swept her into his arms, his tone edged with urgency. "I'm taking you to the hospital,now."

Caught off guard by the sudden lit, Hannah struggled against his chest, protest flaring in her eyes. "No! I'm not going to the hospital!"

Inside, she rolled her eyes-this was just her period,nothing remotely life-threatening.

But Vincent wouldn't budge. "You're losing way too much blood. We're going, end of discussion."

It finally clicked for Hannah-he'd completely misunderstood what was happening. Mortified and bristling, she snapped, "Who said anything about heavy bleeding?"

Vincent stiffened, bafflement flashing across his face."Wait-it's not that serious?"

Hannah's eyes narrowed, her frustration flaring. "No,obviously not!" She squirmed in his arms, voice rising."Put me down. Right now."

Only then did Vincent glance down, finally noticing her fingers digging into her abdomen, knuckles white.

A slick line of blood slid down her thigh, smearing across his wrist where his grip hadn't loosened.

Time seemed to freeze; even the air grew heavy,charged with awkward silence.

For a few suspended seconds, Vincent's mind blanked out. But he wasn't that clueless-his cheeks flushed, understanding flickering in his eyes.

Flushed and desperate to escape, Hannah squirmed free from his hold. Her trembling hands searched blindly for the sanitary pads, heart thumping in her chest.

Vincent hastily snatched a tissue, swiped at his wrist,then reached for a light blanket and draped it around her shoulders. Hannah protested, twisting away.

"You don't want to catch a cold," Vincent muttered,voice gravelly and taut with something he couldn't name.

His gestures were fast, bordering on rough.

Without another word, he spun on his heel and stalked into her walk-in closet.

She heard him fumbling through drawers, his uneven breathing and the restless swish of fabric betraying an urgency rare for someone usually so composed.

A flicker of curiosity ran through Hannah. What was he frantically looking for? Was he actually looking for her sanitary pads? Did he have the faintest clue where she kept them?Vincent reappeared, a fresh pack clutched in hís grip.He pressed it into her palm, silent and brisk. "Go handle it," he muttered, his fingertips lingering just long enough for a flicker of warmth to pass between them.

Hannah snatched the pack, shuffling hastily toward the bathroom.

Vincent hovered outside, his jaw clenched tight with uncertainty. Remembering she couldn't see for now,he called out, "Need help?"

"Absolutely not." Hannah shot back, her words bristling with indignation and mortification.

A sudden crash rang out from the bathroom. Vincent didn't pause. He twisted the lock open and barreled inside.

"What the hell are you doing? Get out!" With a startled edge to her voice, Hannah pulled the towel around herself in a rush.

Vincent's eyes swept over the mess strewn across the floor as he took a step forward. "Come on,Hannah. We've been married before. What's left to be embarrassed about? Just let me help."

He scrubbed his hands at the sink, deliberately slow,and then turned to her. A faint red crept up his neck,but due to her sightless eyes, she didn't notice.

Hannah snapped, "Back off!"

Ignoring the sting, Vincent edged in, determined.The bathroom looked like a war zone, as if they'd been brawling.

His efforts were awkward-every gesture stiff, every movement hesitant-but he pressed on, refusing to leave her struggling alone.

Hannah, weakened and pale, triedto push him away,but the cramps sapped her strength, leaving her powerless to resist.

Eventually, Vincent took charge,sorting out the mess himself.

He tugged at his collar, swallowing against a throat that felt parched. His nerves were shot-more shaken than he'd ever been clinching a billion-dollar merger.

Just as he turned to go, Hannah caught his wrist,her tone sharp as a blade. "Not a single word of this to anyone.Got it?"

"Yeah, okay." Vincent agreed, her touch still burning on his skin as he stepped away.
###Chapter 223 Challenged His Position As CEO

One morning, the board of directors demanded Vincent's immediate presence at the company.His secretary relayed the news-there was a major acquisition on the table, and the board needed everyone present to weigh in and approve the deal.

Not sensing anything amiss, Vincent simply told the butler to watch over Hannah and then swept out of the villa without another word.

Hidden in the shadows, someone clocked Vincent's departure and wasted no time passing the update along.

Meanwhile, at Jones Group's headquarters, the board of directors had gathered on the top floor.

Sunlight spilled in through the soaring windows, but it did nothing to ease the underlying tension. Board members sat in rigid silence around the sprawling mahogany table, a hush hanging thick in the air.

At the head of the table, Vincent held himself with crisp, unyielding poise, the platinum wedding ring on his finger flashing beneath the icy overhead lights.

For ten minutes, he combed through the stack of documents, his brow gradually knitting in displeasure. "Is this acquisition really worth all this fuss?" he asked at last, voice smooth but edged with irritation.

A billion-dollar deal, mapped out with risks and rewards as clear as daylight-he hardly needed anyone's opinion to make the call. It was apparent that the board's intention in summoning him back was not focused on this acquisition.

To his right, Erica sat perfectly composed, every detail of her makeup flawless as she leaned in and spoke in a quiet, deferential tone. "Vincent..."

"Address me properly in this setting," he interjected his words carrying a frosty weight that prickled the skin.

The words sliced through the tension. Erica didn't miss a beat, immediately correcting herself. "Yes, Mr.Jones." Her voice carried a deliberate regret."I called this meeting because we need to address a matter that threatens both the company's future and your reputation."

Vincent leaned back slightly in his chair, resting his elbow on the armrest and pressing his fingers to his temple. His frosty stare bored into Erica, the tension in the room spiking with his silent authority.

Just days earlier, Erica had uncovered Vincent's secret: his plan to travel overseas was for Hannah.He'd quietly undergone a medical evaluation for retina donation, and the results suggest his retina matched. He'd intended to give Hannah his sight.The CEO of Jones Group couldn't afford to be blind,so he planned to vanish overseas post-surgery.What a calculated plan!

But Erica refused to accept it. The idea of Vincent sacrificing his vision for Hannah was intolerable.There was no way she'd let him go through with it.She had already tried, more than once, to talk to him out of it, but he'd stonewalled her every time.Seeing no other way forward, she'd resolved to let the board force his hand.

"Mr. Jones, if you've really made up your mind,then the board deserves an explanation." Erica's voice cut through the air, rising in pitch and bristling with accusation. "Everyone, let's be clear-Mr. Jones intends to abandon the group's core business just so he can be overseas for at least three years-for the sake of his ex-wife, Hannah, who is now blind! He's risking the stability of the group's vast assets and the jobs of countless employees."

Still, Erica chose not to expose Vincent's plan to donate his retina. She wasn't ready to turn the meeting into an all-out war.

The moment her words landed, the meeting room erupted into a storm of shouting and outrage.

"Three years? Are you out of your mind, Mr. Jones? This isn't some child's game!" Keenan Castillo, one of the board members, shot to his feet, his palm striking the table with a force that echoed through the tense conference room.

The silver in his hair glinted under the overhead lights as he glared at Vincent, every word sharp and deliberate. "Our group is knee-deep in critical ventures-the Al city, the overseas acquisitions-none of them can move an inch without you at the helm. Running off overseas now is

Before Vincent could respond, Mayer Ramsey,another one of the board members, surged forward in his seat, his temper flaring as crimson crept up his neck. "If you're about to tank the entire company over a woman, then what's the point of this board,huh? We're not here to watch you throw everything away!"

His voice thundered over the clamor, shaking the nerves of the quieter directors. "We demand an explanation right now! If you refuse, don't think we won't start the process to remove you as CEO!" The rest of the board erupted in support, voices overlapping in a wave of outrage.

"We deserve an explanation!"
"This is completely irresponsible!"

Vincent remained unruffled at the head of the table.He slowly lifted his gaze, his voice slicing cleanly through the uproar. "Are you all finished?"

The uproar collapsed into uneasy silence.

Vincent leaned forward silently, his tone glacial. "Mr.Castillo, that champion racehorse you bought with the three hundred million in misappropriated funds-just snapped its leg in Prirpool. Would you like to explain that?"

Without pausing, he flicked his phone, casting a damning video onto the wall.

Vincent's gaze shifted. "And Mr. Ramsey, should I congratulate you? Your mistress just booked a VIP maternity appointment this morning. Want me to pass that along to your wife?" His thumb slid across his phone, swapping the evidence on display yet again.

Vincent spoke quietly, his voice carrying a subtle warning. "Should I go on?"

The board members he'd called out stiffened, their throats tight with fear.

Vincent rose from his seat, every inch of him radiating an unshakable authority that pressed down on the room. He surveyed the table and then asked in a tone that brooked no dissent, "So, anyone still interested in challenging my position as CEO?"

No one dared to respond; a tense silence swallowed the room.

Without another glance at the board, Vincent turned to leave.

Just then, his phone buzzed with a message from the butler. "Mrs. Jones has fled away."

A cold shadow flickered across Vincent's face.
###Chapter 224 Will You Leave With Me


After days of anxious waiting, a group of people,lurking around the villa, finally spotted their chance-Vincent had departed at last.

The leader of the group wasted no time, dispatching someone to spark a small fire near the property-a perfect diversion for the others to slip in unseen through the back door.

Meanwhile, Hannah was dozing in the courtyard,curled in a creaking rocking chair, her eyes closed to the late afternoon sun. The sudden rustle of footsteps set her on edge. She was about to cry out,but a rough hand clamped over her mouth. "Don't be afraid. We're just..."

Before the intruder could finish, Hannah's teeth sank hard into their palm.
 
The intruder stifled a curse but didn't let go.Trying not to draw attention, another figure slipped behind Hannah and struck her sharply on the neck.Her world tipped into darkness.

Everything happened in eerie silence-the mission executed with swift, practiced efficiency. In moments, Hannah was whisked away.

When Hannah finally came to, the steady drone of a car engine filled her ears. Her fingers searched for her white cane, but it was missing. A tremor of fear ran through her.

No ropes bound her, but Hannah sat stiff and wary.Who would go to such lengths to kidnap her?

The car eventually rolled to a stop. She picked up the muffled sounds of someone climbing out, and then a newcomer's voice she instantly recognized.

The moment the newcomer slipped into the car and softly called her name, every trace of tension melted away from her. The ride resumed, but now she was anchored by a familiar presence.
"Hannah, I can't believe I'm finally seeing you again!"Rena blurted, practically bouncing as she pulled Hannah into a fierce embrace.

Hannah hugged Rena back, dropping her voice to a hush. "Rena, were those people arranged by you?"

Rena released the embrace and held Hannah's hand."Yeah. Felix and I set the whole thing up."

Hannah blinked in mild surprise. "Felix... He's here as well?"

Rena shook her head, her tone light. "Not right now.We agreed to meet at my place later. He'll come by then."

Rena leaned back with a dramatic sigh. "Honestly,Vincent is way too cautious. He kept you locked up in that villa and hardly left. Today was the first time he actually left, giving us a chance to get you out."

Her gaze swept over Hannah, searching for any signs of injuries. "How are you? He didn't do anything to you,did he?" The question triggered a flash of awkward, chaotic memories for Hannah-those ten ridiculous minutes spent fumbling in the bathroom, equal parts confusion and embarrassment. She shook her head,managing a faint smile. "Nothing happened."

Pulling Rena in for a tight hug, Hannah murmured,"Thanks, Rena. Really. And sorry for causing you concerns."

Rena grinned, eyes twinkling. "Actually, there's someone even more concerned than me,you know who l mean."

Hannah's head dipped, her fingers absentmindedly twisting at the hem of her shirt.

It was true-even as an outsider, Rena had noticed how anxious Felix had been these past few days.

Rena nudged Hannah playfully. "So? Tell me-how do you really feel about him?"

Hannah found herself at a loss for words. She'd already made things clear with Felix the last time they spoke.

Catching the awkwardness hanging in the air, Rena offered a gentle smile and steered the conversation elsewhere.


--
When Vincent stepped back into the villa, his eyes immediately landed on Hannah's cane, abandoned on the polished floor. He stooped to pick it up,brushed away a smudge of dust, and frowned. "She left without her cane. What makes you so sure she had run away on her own?" His voice was low and clipped.

The butler's forehead glistened with cold sweat."Because there weren't any signs of a struggle..."

"Go find her-now." Vincent cut the butler off mid-sentence, his voice edged with urgency.

"Yes."

Vincent's men wasted no time. Within the hour,someone reported a sighting-Hannah had turned upat the Brown family estate.

Relief swept through Vincent. Rena had orchestrated Hannah's escape. It hadn't been a month yet-he never imagined she'd vanish from his world so abruptly. And now, just like that, she was gone. Far too early.

For a long moment, Vincent stood motionless with her cane in his hand, lost in the quiet ache of her absence. Finally, he slipped into his car and gave a low order. "Drive to the Brown family estate."
He understood there was no chance of bringing her back. Still, he had to see her one last time. At least,he needed to hand back the cane she'd left behind.

Meanwhile,at the Brown family estate, Hannah was quietly settled into Rena's room.

Felix arrived a few minutes later, his steps brisk with worry.

Sensing the atmosphere, Rena slipped out quietly,leaving them alone to talk. Felix dropped into the seat beside Hannah, his eyes flickering with emotion. "Hannah, it must've been agony for you."

She paused, thoughtful, and realized it wasn't true.The caretakers had treated her kindly, never letting her want for anything. "Honestly, I haven't suffered at all," she said with a small, honest smile.

Relief softened Felix's features. "I'm glad to hear that." He paused and then pressed on, voice firm with conviction. "From now on, V/incent won't be able to take you away again. I promise-we'll mnake sure you're safe."

He clenched his fists in silent resolve, vowing not to let anyone hurt her again.

Hannah's smile turned playful. "You don't have to worry so much. I'm tougher than I look."

In the quiet that followed, Felix remembered all the words he'd swallowed back at the hospital-the ones he hadn't dared to say until now. After all this time,seeing Hannah again cracked his composure. "Hannah, losing your sight doesn't mean your world has to shrink. Let me be the one to guide you through it," he said softly, his thumb brushing the back of her hand with steady reassurance.

Carefully, he lifted her hand to his face, inviting her touch-her fingers grazing his eyelids, hesitant, as if searching for an answer only she could find.

But Hannah's expression tightened. This wasn't the comfort she sought.

Suddenly, the door banged open, the sharp sound shattering the fragile moment.

Hannah's fingertips still lingered above Felix's brow as Vincent strode inside, the cane in his hand striking the floor with a commanding thud. "I hope I'm not interrupting," he said coldly, the challenge in his eyes unmistakable.

Rena rushed over, cheeks tinged with embarrassment. "I tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen," she admitted, voice low. Felix and Vincent traded barbed remarks, tension crackling between them.

The room fell silent, thick with words unspoken.

At last, Vincent's voice broke through, lower and steadier than before. "I've come to bring you back,Hannah. Will you leave with me?"
###Chapter 225 Could You Try To See Me In A Better Light, Just Once
The moment Vincent's words settled in the air, Felix lunged ahead without a second thought, stepping in front of Hannah without hesitation. "There's no way Hannah is coming back to you. She's already had enough," he said, steady and defiant.

Vincent didn't even bolink. "I'm talking to Hannah. Not you," he retorted, his tone clipped and impatient.

"You..." Felix started, but nothing else came out.

Vincent's gaze was intensely locked on Hannah. His voice carried a hint of barely concealed anger.

Hannah rose from the couch and managed a soft answer. "I'm not going back with you." She thought of how long she'd been away from home and knew it was time to return.
 
A wave of relief washed over Felix. A genuine grin  spread across her face. "Did y/ou hear that, Mr.Jones? She doesn't want to leave with you," he said,delight coloring his words.

Sensing the moment, Rena chimed in, determined to wrap things up, "It's best if you leave now, Mr. Jones.Hannah needs her rest," she said, gesturing toward the door.

Despite Rena's prompt, Vincent didn't budge. He fixed his stare on Hannah and pressed on. "Is this really what you want?"

Without missing a beat, Hannah nodded."Yes.I've made up my mind."

A storm of emotion churned in Vincent's eyes, dark and unfathomable. He looked frustrated as he took a purposeful step in Hannah's direction.

Rena's heart pounded with worry. Was Vincent about to take Hannah away by force? But Hannah had clearly said she didn't want to go!

Just as Rena prepared to intervene, Felix moved first,

planting himself squarely in Vincent's path when Vincent was still several feet from Hannah. Felix frowned. "What are you trying to do?"

Vincent merely cast a cold glance at him and then swept past him, heading straight for Hannah.

Before Hannah could process what was happening,Vincent caught her hand in his.

Hannah struggled slightly and calmly asked him,"Are you planning to drag me back against my will?"

Vincent's frown grew sharper. Instead of answering,he silently pressed the cane into her hand.

All at once, the anxiety that had been gnawing at Hannah eased as her fingers closed around the cane.She now realized his approach was meant to pass her the cane. Since losing her sight, the cane had become her anchor, her comfort.

"Could you try to see me in a better light, just once?"Vincent observed her expression, responding to her earlier accusation of him trying to force her back. Yet, Hannah, caught up in the quiet comfort of having the cane back, barely registered Vincent's words. She smiled and asked, "What did you just say?"

Her unguarded smile flickered, lighting up her whole face for an instant. Vincent's gaze faltered-his pupils darkened and his breath caught, but the mask of cold detachment settled over him again before he could let himself feel anything more. "It's nothing."

With heartfelt sincerity, Hannah thanked him while her hand tightened around the cane. His simple gesture had provided exactly what she needed most in that moment.

Vincent raised an eyebrow and shifted the conversation. "It's alright if you've decided not to return." He had already planned to let her go. Holding onto her seemed pointless. "Tell me where you'll be staying. I'll make sure the caregivers and doctors are sent over to help you."

A quiet sigh of relief passed between Rena and Felix as they realized Vincent wouldn't forcefully take Hannah back.

Finding his suggestion too much, Hannah quickly shook her head. "Thanks, but there's really no need.My place is tiny, and I can't fit that many people inside."

Vincent's lips parted slightly. "You don't need to concern yourself. I'll make the arrangements." For him, solutions came easily. If Hannah settled somewhere, he would simply buy a new place nearby.

An awkward silence fell as Hannah held back from arguing further. She understood that Vincent never changed his mind once he made a choice, but she disliked the notion of troubling him.

Observing her discomfort, Felix decided to step in and help. "Mr. Jones, no need to concern yourself about Hannah. Hannah's in good hands with me."

His tone might sound casual, but his words held an underlying meaning. Vincent paid Felix no mind, his attention firmly on Hannah. After a glance at his watch, he spoke quietly. "Don't overdo it with your eyes. Try to get some rest now."

Before leaving, he added, "You don't need to rush into making a decision. Just let me know once you've made up your mind."

Having said his piece, Vincent turned and left,leaving the three of them in the room, momentarily still.

Once inside his car, Vincent hesitated, unsure of his next destination. Only when the driver prompted him did he finally say, "Take me to the office."

Not long after the car started moving, a message from Erica popped up on his phone. "Vincent, you need to come home now. Sharon's condition is worsening!"

Vincent immediately called her, instructing the driver at the same time, "Turn around and head back to the Jones estate!"
###Chapter 226 Sharon's Disagreement


The vehicle hurtled down the road, with Vincent unable to reach anyone at the Jones estate despite his frantic calls.

Thirty minutes afterward, Vincent eventually reached the estate.

He rushed indoors, only to discover his grandmother lounging peacefully on the sofa. With a scowl, he turned toward Erica standing nearby-they had plotted together to fool himn into rushing back.

Erica averted her eyes and softly said, "I'm sorry,Vincent. I did it for your own good."

Her plan to force Vincent into giving up the idea of donating his retina to Hannah with the board session had ended in defeat, leaving her frustrated.Therefore, she'd approached Sharon and revealed everything to her. She figured that the board held no authority over him, yet surely his grandmother,being closest to him, could sway him.

Sharon gazed sternly at Vincent. "Are you seriously going to give your retina to Hannah?"

"I am," Vincent answered, pausing several feet from Sharon.

Once Sharon heard him confirm, her chest swelled with rage, and she rose, her cane striking loudly against the floor. "You reckless boy, are you throwing away the Jones Group? Do you understand how many generations have poured their heart and soul into the company? You..."

Momentarily overwhelmed by her fury, Sharon staggered, prompting Erica to help her ease back down.

Vincent swiftly went to Sharon's side, gently patting her back to help her steady herself.

Placing her palm against her head, Sharon spoke sincerely. "You mustn't act without thinking. The Jones Group cannot collapse, nor can you lose your sight."

Vincent, with deliberate wording, took her hand and responded, "Grandma, I'll ensure everything is handled. Neither I nor the company will fall apart.Believe in me."

Sharon pulled her hand away. "I don't believe you.You'll lose your sight, and once the board discovers your blindness, you'll be stripped of power, and the company will inevitably fall into outsiders' hands."

Vincent's expression was unwavering. "They won't find out." Even if they did, he had nothing to fear. It would merely bring more trouble, nothing he couldn't control.

Sharon's eyes sharpened. "You think your plan of relocating overseas is flawless? Many eyes are fixed on the Jones Group and you, plotting the company's downfall. You might manage to fool others for several months, but over time, they'll surely suspect something. The exposure of your blindness is just a matter of time."
Sharon's anger mounted, tears shimmering in her stare. The Jones Group had previously encountered grave peril, and it was Vincent, at age sixteen, who'd single-handedly rescued it and expanded it into an international powerhouse. The journey was far from smooth.

Vincent's eyes held an unreadable depth, their chill as vast as a bottomless pit. "That works perfectly.While I'm recovering, I'll eradicate the deep-rooted rot within the Jones Group."

"What?" Sharon faltered briefly, stunned by Vincent's words.

Erica was just as taken aback upon hearing this. She suddenly grasped what Vincent had meant by his strategy. She remembered the "flaws" in the board members Vincent had identified earlier that day,realizing his strategy had already been underway.

"The Jones Group has experienced many triumphs,but corruption has infiltrated it. I've wanted to cleanse it for a long time. This overseas trip is my perfect chance." Vincent's stare was piercing, a faint, sly grin on his face, radiating dominance over every detail. His blueprint had long been in place, and this situation had only hastened its execution.

"Even so, you shouldn't be so impulsive. We can find another retina match for Hannah. Anyway, the head of the Jones Group cannot be blind," Sharon said gravely.

Vincent fell silent for a while and then gently said,"Grandma, this is something I owe her." Regardless of the past or present, he felt he was indebted to Hannah.

Sharon grasped Vincent's underlying meaning,her brow tightening. "Even if you feel indebted to her,this is too much. You can't act on emotion."

Erica had kept silent until now, but hearing this, she finally couldn't suppress herself. With a frown, she voiced her thoughts, "Vincent, Sharon's right.Besides, you've already divorced Hannah. There's nothing left to repay."

If it was just about repaying a debt of gratitude, financial compensation would be enough. But she wisely held that thought back.

Vincent simply gave her a frosty look without uttering a single word.

Erica knew that stare-it meant he disliked her interference. Still, she felt the urge to speak up.Like Sharon, she couldn't accept the idea of Vincent losing his sight.

Sharon remarked, "The Jones Group rests on your shoulder. You carry way heavier responsibility than Hannah." Her logic was simple-Hannah was just an ordinary person, unlike him.

"Grandma, that's not true," Vincent replied, a faint bitterness curling his lips. "Hannah is in charge of two companies. You undervalue her."

Just as he once did, his grandmother had underestimated Hannah. He had witnessed Hannah's brilliance onstage, and he couldn't let her drift into darkness through blindness. He would never allow that to happen.
###Chapter 227 A Hunger Strike


A hush fell across the grand hall as soon as Vincent's words sank in.

Sharon's lips quivered. She drew in several shaky breaths before rising once more, her posture rigid with determination. "I'll handle the search for a suitable donor for Hannah myself. I'm asking you one last time-are you absolutely certain about donating your retina to her?"

"Yes," Vincent replied with conviction.

"If that's truly your choice." Sharon's composure faltered, and she nearly stumbled-Erica rushed forward, steadying her just in time.

Tears shimmered on Erica's lashes as she pleaded softly, "Vincent, please don't upset your grandma."

Vincent lowered his gaze and turned to leave. Sharon's tone turned cutting as she stared at Vincent's back. "If you insist on donating your retina,I swear I'll go on a hunger strike until you come to your senses. If you lose your vision, I may as well not go on living."

Erica's heart stuttered with a surge of hope. Maybe this was enough to shake Vincent. Vincent always cared about Sharon, and with her saying this, he couldn't possibly stick to his decision.

Vincent cast Sharon a weary sideways look, letting out a faint sigh. "Grandma, you're overthinking it. It's not like I'll be blind forever." He softened his voice,trying to reason with her. "In another three or five years, if the right donor comes along, I can get an operation to restore my sight."

But Sharon wouldn't hear it. The concern gnawed at her-if his father were still alive, maybe the company could withstand Vincent being away for years. But now, with his father gone, how could the company possibly survive such a long absence? She refused to take any chances. Her voice rang with quiet steel. "This is the only time I'll say it-unless you change your mind, I'm refusing to eat."

Vincent's brow creased in frustration. "Grandma,please don't joke about your heath."

Sharon's gaze sharpened. "And you aren't making a mockery of your own?"

He met her eyes, answering with a rare sincerity, "It's not the same."

"Then tell me-how is it any different?" Sharon's challenge lingered between them.

Words failed Vincent. He could only stand there,silent.

Without another word, Sharon turned away and quietly retreated to her room, leaving the air thick with unresolved tension.

By the next morning, Sharon had barricaded herself inside her bedroom, turning away visitors and refusing so  much as a sip of water. Vincent, equally resolute, refused all food in a show of defiance. He stood vigil outside Sharon's door,trying every plea and gentle coaxing he could think of, but she didn't respond-her silence was absolute.

Three days passed in this deadlock, and Sharon's frail condition noticeably weakened.

Erica approached Vincent carrying a tray. "Vincent,you haven't eaten in three days," she said softly."Please-have something."

But Vincent refused to leave his post, stubbornly rooted at Sharon's door, his features set in weary defiance.

Erica's concern deepened. "It's already the third day.Even if you can hold out, your grandma's body can't take much more." She paused, weighing her words,and then finally urged, "Vincent, don't be so hardheaded. Her health can't handle this. Just give in, at least this once."

A storm of tension gathered in Vincent's features.His jaw tightened, and a shadow crossed his eyes, a palpable aura warning others to keep their distance."You never should have dragged my grandma into this," he said, his voice edged with frustration, every syllable weighted with accusation.

Erica's shoulders tensed, and she looked away,searching for justification. "I only did it because I can't bear the thought of you losing your sight for someone who isn't even family. It isn't worth the cost."

He refused to answer, holding the silence like a drawn blade. At last, he stepped forward and knocked on Sharon's door, the motion deliberate,his voice smooth but unwavering. "Grandma, I've changed my mind. I won't donate."

Sharon's feeble reply drifted from the other side,trembling with exhaustion. Moments later, the door creaked open, and she appeared, her face drawn and almost ghostly. Her eyes searched Vincent's face."Have you thought it through?" she whispered, each word thin and fragile.

He nodded, his face impassive. "Yes, I'll listen to you. Please-eat something now."

Erica wasted no time summoning the servants, and only then did Sharon finally relent and eat something.

For a fleeting moment, the rigid line of Vincent's mouth softened, and the tension in his jaw eased.

Sharon glanced over her shoulder, her voice low but steady. "I'll keep Hannah's situation in mind. You have my word."

Vincent nodded, all business again. "I have things to handle at the company. I'll be leaving now."

He turned and strode out of the estate without a backward glance.

At the threshold, he nearly collided with Danica, who was just returning from a family visit. He brushed past her without a single word or glance, his expression cold and impenetrable.

Danica froze, her smile faltering. A wave of indignation rose up in her chest as she watched Vincent disappear down the steps, not even acknowledging her presence. Such an ungrateful son!

After stepping inside, Danica listened to Erica recount everything, her resentment for Hannah deepening with every word.

Meanwhile, Vincent skipped the company entirely and headed straight to the villa where Hannah once lived to recover. He felt bone-tired, and it was the one place that offered him any semblance of peace.

On the way, he called Marie, "Reschedule the surgery -move it forward." He'd already decided-he would go through with donation and sort out the aftermath later.

Before Marie could respond, he thought of Hannah's condition and asked, "Is Hannah in a condition to go through the surgery? Any issues?"

"No, none at all. She is doing well."

"Good." He hung up without another word.

For the past three days, he'd been too stretched to check on Hannah, and now he had no idea how she was holding up. Still, if all went as planned, she wouldn't need the round-the-clock doctors and caregivers much longer. Soon, she'd be able to see again.

Exhaustion weighed on him, yet sleep remained elusive. He slumped back in the backseat, closing his eyes,letting the motion of the car offer what little relief it could.

When Vincent finally arrived at the villa, the caregivers were still bustling about their duties.

Without pausing, he made his way to the top floor. As he passed the sunroom, a familiar silhouette caught his eye. Drawn in by instinct, he found himself stepping quietly inside.
###Chapter 228 A Farewell Kiss


Rocking gently in the chair, Hannah let herself soak up the sunlight with her eyes closed. A soothing comfort settled over her, putting her at ease.

The sound of Vincent's voice, rougher than usual,drifted across the room."You're back."

Blinking open her eyes, Hannah repolied in a quiet tone, "Yes. Dr. Heidemann wanted me to come for a follow-up."

All the medical equipment required for her checkup was here, which prompted her visit.

Instead of speaking, Vincent simply watched her,silent and attentive.

Time passed before he finally broke the silence."How have things been for you lately?"

With a casual shrug, Hannah said, "Things have been
Lewis & Clark Grad School alright."

Behind that simple answer, plenty of worries had piled up. Her parents had struggled to tend to her daily needs, and while she'd wanted to hire some help, they'd been determined not to spend extra money. A lifetime spent saving every penny had convinced them they could handle everything themselves.

That stubbornness had led to arguments, leaving Hannah hurt and frustrated more than once. Her parents' way of seeing things was very different from hers.

She hadn't cared much for public opinion, but her father always had. His pride had kept him from letting others know his daughter had lost her sight, even though she would restore her sight after the upcoming surgery. Because of that, he'd refused to let her go out, insisting it was for her own good.She'd understood where he was coming from.

Just to get permission to see the doctor at the villa,she'd had to convince her father for quite some time. Finally reaching the villa, she felt a wave of relief wash over her.

Vincent swallowed hard before he spoke. "You know you'll be having surgery soon, right?"

Hannah gave a small nod. "I know." She followed it up with a quiet. "Thank you."

Her appreciation came from the heart.

A slight crease formed on Vincent's brow. "You've said 'thank you' many timnes." To him, her politeness was her way of putting distance between them.

Hannah kept her tone calm. "It's only fair to express my gratitude. You've done a lot for me."

Vincent's gaze was fixed on her. "Your surgery is just a few days away. Stay here and get plenty of rest."

Hoping to soften the impact of his words, he added,"Does that sound alright to you?" He wanted to make sure there were no complications before the surgery. Hannah thought for a moment, recalling the conflicts with her parents, and finally agreed. "Alright, but l have one condition-I want my independence respected."

A slight crease formed between Vincent's brows."just want you to be safe."

No response came from Hannah. She stood her ground in silence.
Vincent noticed the stubborn set of her jaw, so he finally gave in. "'If that's what you want, I'll respect it."

Over the following two days, Vincent took care of every detail. He instructed Derek to book his flight,and all his trusted employees at the company were informed of his plan to flee abroad.

Every night, Vincent made a point of sleeping at the Jones estate so his grandmother would not worry and suspect a thing.

The last day before the surgery, as the evening settled in, Vincent caught sight of a caregiver
 bringing medication toward Hannah's door.

The clock on the wall read just past seven.

On impulse, he stopped the caregiver. "Let me bring it to her this time."

"Of course."

Tomorrow marked the day for her retinal transplant.Post-surgery, he would leave the country, and she would return to her old life dynamics. There wouldn't be any more chances to talk after tonight.

Raising his hand, Vincent knocked lightly on Hannah's door. "It's time for your medicine," he announced.

The sound of his voice, low and calm, made Hannah pause."Why are you bringing the medicine today?"

With a casual air, Vincent offered an explanation."The caregiver got tied up for a bit."

Hannah wasn't convinced. There were plenty of staff,but she let it go without saying more.
Vincent's hand reached for hers, guiding her fingers carefully so she could feel the cup and the small pill in his palm."Take the pill with water."

Following his guidance, Hannah took the pill and then sipped the water, the water chasing away the pill's bitterness.

Finished with the medicine, she returned the cup.Vincent took it from her with care, his fingertips inadvertently brushing against hers, leaving a lingering warmth.

Vincent remained rooted to the spot, not making any move to leave.

A sudden hush settled over the room, as if the air itself held its breath.

Hannah could feel his gaze fixed on her for quite a while, the weight of his attention impossible to ignore.

Breaking the silence, Vincent finally said,"Everything's in place for your surgery tomorrow." A quiet "mm" escaped Hannah as she nodded, yet her heart started to pound faster at the thought of what awaited her. Uneasiness lingered, nerves tightening in her chest.

Taking a deep breath, Vincent's words came slower and heavier than usual. "Dr. Heidemann is among the best. The entire surgical team is top-notch, and she's confident the chances for a good result are high."

With her fingers wrapped tighter around the cane,Hannah whispered, "Alright."

She understood his omission of the risks, all for calming her nerves.

Silence returned, and Hannah sensed Vincent getting closer.When she furrowed her brow, ready to voice a question, Vincent acted. No hesitation marked his movement. There was nothing uncertain about it.

In a sudden rush, Vincent bent down, his hand closing firmly around the back of her neck, the grip unyielding, while his other hand clamped over her wrist, the one that had just dropped, his knuckles pale from the force he'd used.

A moment later, his lips crashed against hers with undeniable force
###Chapter 229 She Could See Again


The kiss crashed down on Hannah, fierce and unrelenting.

Vincent's mnouth burned against hers, his desperate lips parting hers with a hungry insistence, as though he meant to drink in every last breath she had.

Hannah's mind went utterly blank. The world, already plunged into darkness by her blindness, seemed to lose every trace of sound and air, every sense but the shattering urgency of his kiss-so consuming that it threatened to obliterate her.

"Mm..." A muffled whimper escaped her, but even that small sound was lost between them, swallowed whole by his intensity.

At last-after what felt like forever-Vincent tore himself away. He drew back, breath harsh, hands unclenching from her wrist and the nape of her neck. Then, he let his forehead drop, heavy and unsteady,until it pressed against hers.

"Promise me you'll live your best life," he murmured,his voice raw and ragged, as if the man who'd just kissed her so fiercely was someone else entirely.

After speaking, he hurriedly slipped out of the room,pulling the door shut with careful restraint.

Hannah sat alone in thequiet, her lips still tingling from the heat of his kiss, the ghost of his grip lingering on her wrist. What drove Vincent to kiss her?

The question spun through her mind until, unable to bear it, she slammed her fist into the pillow, cheeks flushed in frustration. She'd actually let herself melt for that split second. Ridiculous. It must be the medication that had clouded her thoughts.

Meanwhile, out in the hallway, Vincent leaned against the wall, his pulse racing so hard that he could feel it in his throat. Only after regaining his composure did he leave. With surgery scheduled for tomorrow, Hannah barely slept that night, tossing and turning as worry gnawed at her.

By morning, a caregiver carefully guided Hannah into the car. The gentle hum of the engine and the plush seats soon coaxed her into a restless doze.

Vincent had arrived at the hospital before her. He'd double-checked the treatment plan with Marie, his nerves stretched taut as a bowstring. Now, all that remained was for Hannah to arrive.

But half an hour crawled by with no sign of Hannah.

He dialed the driver's number-no answer. His pulse spiked as he quickly rang the butler, who confirmed Hannah had gotten into the car as planned. Still,the driver's silence gnawed at him.
An hour later, the driver finally picked up, his voice trembling with panic. "Mr. Jones, I'm sorry. Someone drugged me and the bodyguards. They took the car."

A cold chill shot through Vincent. Someone had taken Hannah? The words detonated in his mind. Not even bothering to end the call, he charged out of the hospital, barking rapid-fire orders to his bodyguards and the butler-everyone was to fan out and start searching for Hannah immediately.

A sense of dread twisted in Vincent's gut. Had Hoffman's remaining followers finally made a move against Hannah? And at such a critical time,no less!



Hannah drifted awake, her mind foggy, as fragments of conversation floated above her. Men's voices tangled in the gloom. She kept her eyes closed,feigning unconsciousness.

"Just toss her here, all right?" growled one man, his voice rough like gravel.

"What else? You want to drag her down the main road instead?" another snapped, impatience crackling in his tone.

The first speaker pressed on. "Now that we've got the cash, let's get out of here already. This blind woman is already worthless to us."

A brutal kick struck Hannah's side, her forehead slamming against cold stone.

"She looks rich. Maybe she has something valuable on her?"

"Then get moving and start searching."

The two men rifled through her things, snatching her necklace and earrings without a second thought.After that, they yanked a rough sack over her head.

"Let's get out of here before her man comes looking," one muttered, anxiety sharpening his tone."I've heard he's the last person you want after you."

Their footsteps echoed down the path, growing fainter until Hannah was alone.

Fighting a wave of nausea, Hannah forced herself upright and struggled free of the sack.

On reflex, her fingers searched the ground for her cane. And then she froze. For a split second, her own hand came into focus, pale against the dirt.

Her breath caught. She blinked, hard. The blurry world sharpened, shadows and colors slowly snapping into view. She could see... She could really see again!

A dizzy, wild joy swelled inside her chest. Scanning her surroundings, she realized she'd been dumped in a forgotten,overgrown park.

After walking for a long time, Hannah drifted onto a bleak, empty street, the silence pressing in from every side.

With no idea how much time had slipped by, she finally managed to wave down a passing car. The driver eyed her suspiciously, hesitating until she coldly named a reward: ten thousand dollars, cash.Greed won out over caution. With a grunt, the driver agreed to take her.

She rattled off the address of Sterling Heights first,but the  navigation app blinked back a dauntingthree-hour drive. So she opted for the villa at Mapleridge instead-just a twenty-minute drive away.Without hesitation, Hannah settled on the closer destination, her mind already racing ahead.

By the time she reached the villa's entrance, her nerves had finally settled. The facial recognition panel blinked green, confirming her identity and unlocking the gates with a quiet mechanical click.

Inside, an unsettling silence hung in the air. The place felt almost deserted-far fewer caregivers bustled about than she remembered. As she wandered down the echoing hallway toward her room, the absence of familiar voices pressed in around her.

When she searched her bank card for the driver,her fingers brushed against a folded sheet of paper. She drew it out, puzzled, and recognized the surgery consent form she'd signed not long ago.

A glance at the document made her heart jolt-Vincent's name leapt out at her, inked with  unwavering certainty.

Only after rereading the line twice did the truth hit her: it was Vincent, not a stranger, who had agreed to donate his retina to her.
###Chapter 230 Embrace


Noise in the backyard drew the caregivers' attention,making them think an intruder was lurking nearby.The currently careless security system at the villa meant it wasn't impossible for someone to slip inside.

The caregivers grabbed wvhatever objects they could find, brooms, vases, even a shoehorn, ready to confront whoever had broken in. Yet, the moment they glimpsed the silhouette of the intruder,all their weapons dropped from their hands in shock.

One caretaker stammered out, "M-Mrs. Jones?"

All the caregivers were dumbfounded. Who would have guessed the woman everyone had been searching for was actually in the villa? But only hours earlier, they'd watched her being taken away in a car.

Hearing footsteps, Hannah turned and held out a card to a nearby caretaker. "Please give this to the driver out front," she instructed with quiet authority.

In a daze, the caretaker took the card and wandered outside to deliver it.

Hannah, meanwhile, wandered into another room,her movements unhurried and deliberate. The other caregivers exchanged confused glances. Had her vision returned?

Snapping out of her daze, one caretaker whispered to her colleagues, "Watch over Mrs. Jones. I'll call the butler," then hurried off to place the call.

Wherever Hannah went, a trail of caregivers followed.

The sprawling villa seemed both familiar and foreign to Hannah. Every hallway was padded for safety, and Marie's medical setup was far more high-tech than she had imagined. Inside Marie's office, stacks of surgical notes and a thick compatibility report caught her eye.

A step into the sunroom revealed a sanctuary made of glass, brimming with flowersof every kind. In the garden, there was a sparkling fountain, a new addition, the caregivers explained, commissioned by Vincent just for her.

Curiosity led Hannah upstairs to the villa's top floor, a place she'd never explored, which the caregivers called Vincent's private retreat. She found a wall of surveillance screens.

A closer look at his desk revealed a surgical consent form, its date even older than her own. Nearby, a property deed lay waiting, confirming that he had already signed the entire villa over to her.

Rows of Braille books were stacked beside the papers, each one made for the visually impaired.

Only then did understanding dawn on Hannah-the meaning behind Vincent's words that day finally clicked into place. Those Braille books indeed weren't bought for her-they were for him. He had arranged everything. He had brought her to the cemetery and told her, "There won't be another chance." That kiss, sudden and unexplained,had left her stunned, especially when he urged her to live thebest life she could.

Only now did she realize why his parting words felt so irrevocable, like the closing of a ###Chapter.

Heavy with shock, the sheet of paper in her grip seemed to weigh her down, and a trembling started in her limbs that she could not control. Why had he made such a momentous decision without asking her?


***

Vincent's first thought was that Hoffman's crew was behind Hannah's disappearance. Without wasting a second, he gathered his men and stormed out,heading straight for the gang's known hideout.

A while later, seventeen black Land Rovers smashed against the fencing of an abandoned auto shop on the city's edge, once known as "Fortune." Within three minutes, the fencing was torn through.
Metal screeched as hydraulic tools tore the main roller door wide open, clearing the way for Vincent to
step directly into the chaos.

Bodyguards swarmed in behind him, raising their guns and pinning every scrambling figure in their sights.

Amid the scrambling figures, one bald man made a desperate dash for freedom, but he didn't make it far. Within seconds, hewas pinned to the floor.

Flattened against the concrete, the bald man began to beg, panic choking his voice. "I won't do it again, I swear! Please, just let me go."

A slight nod from Vincent was all it took. Instantly, a guard planted his boot on the bald man's head,grinding the latter down without mercy.

Vincent's question was ice-cold and unmistakable."Where is she?"

The bald man hesitated, recalling he and his crew had indeed kidnapped a married woman a few days ago. Desperate, he pleaded, "I'm sorry, I never would've touched her if l'd known she was your woman!"
Fury burned in Vincent's expression. "What did you do to her?" He wasted no time, snatching a gun from his bodyguard's side and pressing the barrel to the bald man's forehead, his finger ready on the trigger.

Suddenly, a ring broke the tension, a call for one of the guards.

Answering quickly, the bodyguard's expression shifted as he listened. He leaned over to Vincent,speaking quietly but urgently. "Mrs. Jones has turned up.She's safe."

Vincent halted, his finger froze on the trigger.

A heavy, uneasy silence fell over the shop, broken only by the shallow breaths of the men pinned to the floor.

Every gun was still aimed, every gaze frozen.

The bald man, subdued on the floor, stared up with wide, terrified eyes, but that fear slowly gave way to puzzlement. Calmly, Vincent withdrew the gun and passed it to his guard. "Let's get out of here," he ordered, his tone cool and final.

His bodyguards wasted no time, securing their weapons and streaming out in silent formation.
The call had ended too quickly for the group to hear the butler's next words, "She has regained her sight."

Once the car pulled up to the villa, Vincent didn't hesitate. He sprinted straight inside, his eyes searching until they landed on Hannah standing by the sunroom window. Excitement and disbelief crashed together in his chest, his heart pounding wildly.

Feet barely touching the floor, he closed the distance, too intent on reaching her to notice what she was holding.

Without a word, he swept her up in an embrace so fierce that it nearly knocked the air from her lungs."Thank God you're safe."
Hannah was trapped in his embrace, his strength almost suffocating. She had just clearly seen his current disarray-his eyes rimmed red, jacket ripped,every inch of him was scattered and undone.

Determined, she broke away from his hold,holding up a piece of paper, and demanded, "Vincent!Explain this to me!"

Their eyes met, and Vincent stared back, searching her face. "You can see now?"
###Chapter 231 Only You


Vincent asked, seeking confirmation, "You...You can actually see now?" His voice wavered, thick with a feeling he hadn't yet named.

Something unsteady flickered in his eyes, but before he could reach for Hannah, she edged away, her tone sharp and uncompromising. "Don't move. Stay right there. Answer me-what on earth is this?" She leveled the surgical consent form at him.

His gaze darted to the sheet, realization hitting him with a jolt. "So you know everything now."

Hannah's expression didn't waver. "Vincent, just tell me the truth. Is it you who'll be donating your retina to me today?"

"Yes," Vincent replied, meeting her gaze without a hint of evasion.

Hannah barked out a short, scathing laugh-gone as quickly as it appeared. Her eyes burned with cold fire. "If you go blind, what does that leave for the Jones Group? Planning to have your subordinates prepare all future contracts translated into Braille so that you can read with sightless eyes?"

Vincent straightened his back, his jaw set with quiet determination. "I can handle the company. That's not your concern."

She shot him a look laced with disbelief. "So, you think reading Braille contracts is a brilliant strategy?"

His answer came without hesitation, his voice unyielding. "All I care about is you getting your sight back. And this is the quickest, surefire way to make it happen."

"Quickest? Surefire?"' Hannah scoffed, the sound as sharp as a slap. Instead of leaving, she stepped toward Vincent, her eyes blazing with challenge."Vincent, drop that self-sacrificing act. Let me make it clear one more time. I leapt and shielded you from the explosion because it was the right thing to do. lt had nothing to do with you. I don't need you to sacrifice your retina to prove I'm that special to you,and I definitely don't need you to help speed up my recovery 'for my own good!' Had you even bothered to ask me about my wishes and feelings? You never had!"

Frustration burned in her chest, fueling every word.She couldn't stand his self-appointed savior complex.

Vincent couldn't fathom her tirade. Her words landed hard, slicing straight through his heart. All these days, he'd been hounding doctors for the progress of her recovery, losing sleep over her blindness. And he'd been treating her as if she might shatter at the slightest touch, tending to her every whim. Yet now,her words trampled all over the care and efforts he'd poured into her.

"Ask about your wishes and feelings?" Vincent's down mood twisted into a simmering fury, his tone lowering to a quiet snarl. He closed the distance between them, his shadow looming over her like a thundercloud. "What? You seriously think your sightlessness is none of my business?"

His jaw tightened, frustration bleeding through every word. "You lost your sight because you saved me!That's the damn truth! I don't want to owe a woman,and I sure as hell don't need anyone to tell me how to repay this life-saving favor!"

The air crackled with the intensity of his presence,the entire room seeming to shrink beneath his stormy glare.

Hannah's patience snapped, his response fanning her rage to a white-hot blaze. "Vincent, open your damn eyes!" she fired back, sweeping down to snatch the consent form and thrusting it inches from his face. "Voluntarily assume all risks, including permanent blindness! You really think surrendering your eyesight for my sake will move me?"

Pausing to let her words sink, she added, "No! This isn't selflessness-it's your ego talking! You want to be the hero so badly that you can't see how you're shoving your don't-owe-anyone complex onto me.You think sacrificing your retina gives you the right to brand me with this for life? You think I'll bow down and thank you for hanging this over my head?" Her voice splintered the air, shaking with fury.

"Brand you?" Vincent's jaw went rigid. Her accusations landed hard-too hard. He seized her wrist, his grip rough, the form nearly slipped from her fingers. "Hannah, don't be ungrateful! Do you know how many people would beg for what I'm offering?I'm willing to give up my eyes for you, and no one else on this planet could push me this far-only you!What the hell do you want from me?"

"Let go of me!" Hannah jerked her wrist, heat flaring beneath his vise-like grip, but he wouldn't budge.

She snapped, her voice raw and shaking, "I don't need you to go this far for me! We're already divorced! Papers signed, money taken, done deal!We're even, I said it before!"

Vincent's jaw set, a muscle ticking as her defiance landed. She hurled these same lines at him again."Even? Divorced?" He didn't loosen his grip. Instead,he drew her in, his eyes blazing with relentless determination. "That divorce agreement means nothing to me. You're still mine, Hannah. No stack of papers changes the fact that we've been together,that you saved my life. Nothing changes my commitment to owning this!"

Vincent's possessiveness crackled in the air, an uneasy blend of obligation and a raw, territorial longing he couldn't tamp down. He couldn't stand her trying to cut him off.

"Your eyesight's back. Wonderful. But I said I'd see this through, and I will. I'm not asking for permission.I'm laying it out for you-period." His voice dropped,cold as steel.

Their gazes clashed, neither willing to retreat.

Tension shimmered between them until, at last, a single, burning tear slipped down Hannah's cheek,startling him.

And just like that, Vincent's fury fizzled like a snuffed-out flame, replaced by confusion. He reached for her, gentler now. "Hannah... Why are you
###Chapter 232 | Once Thought You've Changed
Hannah dragged her palm across her cheeks,scrubbing at the wetness with a harshness that reflected her fury. She avoided glancing at Vincent,locking her attention on the constellation-filled darkness beyond the glass, while her knuckles curled inward unconsciously.

A burning irritation boiled beneath Hannah's ribs,pressing harder than her lack of vision had ever done. Vincent's self-righteous interference and vice-like grip over her condition chilled her deeper than anything before.

Vincent's reply came level, each syllable slow. "There was no other donor when I signed that consent form."

He laid out his reasoning to Hannah with stiff clarity,driven by pragmatism rather than impulse. With Hannah pleading for release, offering his own sight was the fastest resolution.

Vincent advanced slightly, halting mere inches from her, his gaze tracing her outline. "Anyway, you've regained your vision now. That's what matters."

Hannah sliced through the tension with her tone like frost. "That's what matters? Yeah, I bet it does for you. Your signature on the consent form, your grand act,your way of fixing things. From beginning to end,this has always been you, Vincent, steering everything."

She leveled her stare directly at him, enunciating each word deliberately. "Were you the one who blinded me? No-I jumped in to shield you from harm,and I accept the consequences. Did I ask you to donate your retina to me? I never have, and I never will."

Hannah inhaled slowly, subduing the storm inside into an eerie composure. "If I hadn't regained my sight, and we'd gone through with the surgery, I'd be buried under the shadow of your grand sacrifice, bound to your side because of it. Was that your aim?"

Vincent caught the crux of her statement."Hannah,I never expected something like that from you." His tone dropped, weighted with something dense."But l made my choice. Hate me or resent me,whatever.I only did what I thought was right. That consent form?It's just a piece of trash now. You've got your sight back, I don't need to donate my retina, and that's the end of it."

Vincent fixed his eyes on hers, his voice bearing unshakable force.

Silence grew between them like thick fog.

Then, Hannah shattered it without warning."I once thought you've changed."

Hannah's mind flashed to that day at the cemetery,when they'd both let their guards down, and she'd started to see Vincent in a new light.

In her early blindness, his dominance had grated on
her, but she couldn't ignore the quiet ways he'd been there for her.

She remembered waking ravenous in the early light one day, and Vincent had quietly whipped her a bowl of oatmeal.

She recalled those chaotic ten minutes during her period, how he'd left, only to return holding a drink to ease the ache.

And when she woke up from the nightmare one night, unable to fall back asleep, leaving her sitting dazed on her bed, he'd come to her doorway and asked in a gentle voice, "Anything else bothering you besides your loss of sight? Talk to me."

Every moment of care from Vincent was scorched into Hannah's thoughts. Piece by piece, she'd dropped her guard, convinced he was changing bit by bit. That was the reason she'd come back to the villa. She'd hoped their next meeting could be civil,maybe even kind. But what faced her now? She couldn't stomach it. The magnitude of the sacrifice was too much for her to accept. "I was so naive," Hannah muttered, her laugh dry and sharp. "I honestly believed you'd begun to consider what others feel, even just a fraction."

Vincent's chest tightened sharply, her comment hitting like a blow.

Her glare turned frigid. "I'm human, Vincent. I get to chart my journey. Even if that road means staying in the dark or clinging to the tiniest thread, I'd still walk it proudly. But you? You handled me like I was some object on your board. You never respected me."

Her voice trembled slightly before she took a deep breath, holding her tears back.

Vincent, for once, had no reply. He managed, "1didn't view you as some object."

To Hannah, his words felt hollow. She didn't meet his eyes, fatigue overtaking her limbs. "That oatmeal you served? It tasted terrible. But believing you'd changed, only to face this? That's what truly turns my stomach."  Vincent felt a paralyzing pressure tighten around him, alien and unbearable. His usual logic,calculated decisions, and outcome-driven mindset collapsed under the realization of the damage he'd done.

Stillness settled thickly in the room.

Vincent's jaw clenched, struggling to keep himself composed. "You've just recovered your vision. Don't get worked up. I'll get a physician."

Vincent attempted to divert the moment, his instinct to command still there, though concern laced every word.

Hannah moved to exit, but Vincent's arm intercepted hers, firm and immovable. "You're not stepping out until we confirm you're stable!"

Hannah's eyes stung, too drained to argue on this.Once the doctor gave her the all-clear, she slipped out while Vincent was distracted.

Upon noting her departure, Vincent's eyes darkened as he turned to his guards. "Don't let her out of
###Chapter 233 They Make Such A Perfect Match
Since their heated clash, Hannah and Vincent hadn't crossed paths again.

Hannah buried herself in her role, dedicating sixty days to catapulting Polaris Tech and Nova Tech into industry dominance.

Nova Tech's hormone-detecting wristband launched with a frenzy, selling out instantly during pre-sales and exploding across digital platforms.

Polaris Tech's immersive narrative game, Mirror Souls, surged to the summit of platform rankings at beta, receiving stellar feedback and accumulating major revenue.

Hannah's fearless choice to spotlight a greenhorn head creator, despite resistance, turned into a legendary move within the professional circle. Within two months, Hannah's resolve and brilliance attracted admiration, quieting critics who had once labeled her a clueless kept woman or those who'd once underestimated her post-split and vision loss.

That afternoon, after a session ended, Hannah entered her workspace. Felix presented her with an elegant gold-lettered card for Silverwood University's hundred-year ceremony-a distinction reserved for elite alumni.

Hannah's chest fluttered. It marked her debut receiving that honor. Before now, she'd only seen such an invitation go to Vincent.

"Should be fun," Felix remarked, studying her expression. "Planning to attend?"

"Maybe," Hannah muttered, flinging the card aside.Mingling wasn't her thing.

"You've been running nonstop for weeks. Take time off. The invite says you can show up with loved ones,associates, or friends," Felix uurged.
 Hannah, sorting documents, looked up. "You are desperate to go?"

Felix hesitated and then gave a subtle nod. He was craving uninterrupted time with Hannah-something their recent workload hadn't allowed.

After pondering a beat, Hannah relented. "Alright,we'll attend." She figured she could use a break.

Felix's delighted expression radiated enough joy to brighten the entire building.

******

When the centenary bash at Silverwood University arrived,high-profile guests flooded the entryway.

Just as Hannah and Felix exited their glossy vehicle,she noticed familiar figures engaging nearby.

Tyler Craig, an economics professor, was laughing beside the distinguished academician Bjorn Haywood.Flanking Bjorn was Miles.

Hannah wasn't quite surprised. She'd done her  homework on Miles while investigating VitraMind.He'd graduated from Silverwood University, three years ahead of her. Bjorn and Miles seemed tight,with Miles attentively nodding as Bjorn spoke.

When Hannah's gaze met Miles's, Miles gave Bjorn and Tyler a nod before approaching Hannah.

Felix and Hannah exchanged courteous greetings with Miles.

"Caught you off guard, Mr. Whitaker?" Hannah joked,spotting the flicker of shock across his face.

"A bit," Miles admitted. Back when Hannah pitched her proposal, she hadn't mentioned a thing about them being alumni. He straightened his gilded eyewear.

Hannah offered a playful smirk. "Didn't realize you wore glasses."

Miles arched a brow. "Not my vibe?"
  
"No, they suit you," Hannah replied, holding her grin.  "Mr.Whitaker, I've got some thoughts on Polaris Tech's next moves I'd love to bounce off you,"Hannah added.

They dove into a spirited back-and-forth, ideas flying.

Felx stood off to the side, struggling to jump in.

Nearby, Tyler and Bjorn observed Miles and Hannah's exchange, faces glowing with unmistakable appreciation.

Tyler leaned over and said quietly, "They make such a perfect match. Think the online buzz about them dating has some truth?"

The internet had been swirling with talk of Hannah and Miles being romantically linked, based on their constant appearances together.

Bjorn nodded. "I'd like it to be real. They're well-matched. Imagine their kids, total heartbreakers!"

Tyler's tone mellowed. "Yeah. Alas, too bad about Hannah and Vincent. They were wild about each other back then."

Bjorn waved it off. "Too bad? Please. Hannah is dominating her field, and Vincent's career thrives.Best-case scenario. Their intense, messy ###Chapter? It ended neatly-with no bitterness."

Lurking behind, Vincent heard every word, each sentence a jab to the gut. His gaze narrowed on Hannah and Miles, the dazzling pair everyone adored.

As the university's president, Connor Todd, paused mid-tour to gesture at a landmark, he froze, chilled by Vincent's abrupt shift in demeanor. The trailing administrators exchanged tense glances, baffled by Vincent's sudden mood change.

Erica, tracing Vincent's focus, pieced it together."Isn't that Ms. Scott with Mr. Whitaker? They're awfully close. Maybe the rumors online weren't far off."
###Chapter 234 Maybe Find Someone To Tie The Knot With
Vincent's expression darkened further.

Erica got ahead of Vincent, moving toward Hannah's circle with an easy grin. "Mr. Whitaker, Ms. Scott, it's been such a long time!"

Hannah stopped mid-sentence, glanced at Erica,and resumed her discussion with Miles, unfazed.

Miles had never met Erica and didn't acknowledge her presence.

Felix sensed the strange tension and asked,"Hannah, are you familiar with her?"

Hannah answered like it was obvious, "No."

Hannah casually scanned the group trailing behind Erica, her eyes briefly locking with Vincent's. She looked away, cool as ice.
.Vincent caught the coldness in her look, and his features tightened.

From a distance, Connor noticed Hannah and approached with energy. "Hannah, you're here!Wonderful to see you! Time's flown. You and Vincent -both doing great! I remember those days under the oak tree..."

Hannah cut him off, her tone polite but firm. "Mr.Todd,you're too kind."

She lifted her gaze and collided with Vincent's shadowed stare.

Connor continued enthusiastically, "Vincent, you see,Hannah's been making waves lately! I read her feature in that finance piece. Incredible work!"

Vincent gave a brief nod, his presence strong but remote, his reply monotone. "Yeah, I caught that too."

Vincent's eyes returned to Hannah, and a subtle grin emerged as he addressed her, "Ms. Scott, congrats. Your company's on a roll."

In just two months, Hannah had shown serious guts and drive.

Hannah replied politely yet distantly, "Thank you."She turned to look at Connor. "The business owes a lot to my two co-founders."

Hannah introduced Felix to Connor and pulled Miles into the conversation.

Erica stood off to the side, irritated that Hannah was praised. Unable to hold back, she jumped in. "Ms.Scott, your name is everywhere lately. Such a powerhouse! Partnering with those two sharp minds -impressive! But overworking leads to burnout. You push so hard-it must be draining! Maybe consider settling down with someone like Mr. Whitaker-young and accomplished."

The mood shifted instantly. Miles finally turned toward Erica, disdain etched across his face. Felix's demeanor also soured. Connor and the faculty nearby sensed the growing discomfort.
 Vincent furrowed his brow, sending Erica a hard,measuring stare.

Before Hannah could reply, Vincent spoke with chilly precision."Erica."

Erica bit down on her tongue, furious. She'd always hated it when Vincent used "auntie," but now,hearing her name brought no comfort. His tone was a clear order to zip it.

Hannah reacted like Erica had told a bad joke. Her gaze drilled into Erica, not with rage, but like someone observing something beneath notice. "Ms.Stanton? If memory serves, this is our third encounter?"

Her voice stayed composed, but each syllable cut."Your obsession with my career and personal life? It's crossing a line. And whether ambition wears me down? That's for me to decide. What I do know is building my own career beats hoping for a man's charity."

Hannah dragged out her next words, her tone biting.
"And it seems to me that your unsolicited advice suits you better since you've got nothing better to do than trying to meddle in my life. Maybe find someone to tie the knot with. With your mindset, I doubt you can achieve anything at work."

"You..." Erica stood there, words failing her. Feeling the judgmental glances from the nearby crowd, she silently balled her fists.

Erica straightened up, firing back with forced calm,"Ms. Scott, getting personal like that? That's a low blow."

Hannah, mid-turn and her gown lifted, halted and glanced. back, brow slightly knit. "Please use Ms.Scott." Her stare was cutting, and her tone brooked no challenge. "Low blow? I didn't throw the first one."

Erica didn't move, locked in place and fuming.

Hannah ignored Erica and turned to Felix. "Let's go inside."

Vincent's gaze stayed glued to Hannah, so intense that he forgot to chew out Erica. Hannah fully embodied the fierce reputation she'd earned in the media.

Miles leaned toward Vincent, speaking quietly. "Mr.Jones,thank you."

Miles was grateful for the behind-the-scenes cash and resources Vincent had funneled to Polaris Tech.

"No thanks needed. I'm just an investor." Vincent hadn't shown favoritism, but HHannah's brilliance had shattered every bar he'd set. She was exceptional.
###Chapter 235 Familiar Suit


Silverwood University's hundred-year festivity unfolded without a hitch, culminating in the night's lavish feast and formal ball.

The gathering occurred within the freshly unveiled Diamond Dome Hall.

Hannah, Miles, and Felix found themselves surrounded by prominent industry magnates,drawing attention effortlessly.

At the edge of the dance floor, Erica mingled smoothly, offering dazzling grins to a cluster of elite women. However, her gaze continually shifted to Hannah, whose presence seemed to captivate everyone.

A frosty grin tugged at Erica's mouth as she glanced slyly at a nearby young waiter. He was carrying a platter of red wine, poised to navigate through the partygoers.Feigning an outfit adjustment, Erica subtly slid out her left leg, tripping the waiter with a calculated nudge.

The waiter gave a startled cry, flailing as he collided into Hannah,who had been deep in a discussion.

The tray flew from,his hands, launching about seven glasses in midair, their red contents flinging toward Hannah like a crashing wave.

With a split-second reaction, Miles's pupils widened,and he sprang into action, throwing himself in front of Hannah.

The sticky wine splashed across Miles's back.

The waiter, ghostly pale, mumbled frantic apologies,completely paralyzed with alarm.

Miles's dark blue designer attire was completely saturated, with the scent of alcohol spreading rapidly.

Observing nearby, Erica noted her ploy hadn't gone as intended, though another opportunity bloomed in her thoughts.Drawing a few socialites into her circle,her expression brightened with mischievous delight."Did you catch that? Looks like Mr. Whitaker and Ms.Scott are totally an item."

A woman clad in a violet gown beamed. "For sure-he totally shielded her!"

Someone in a lemon-colored gown released a dreamy sigh. "I've caught Mr. Whitaker watching MMs.Scott all night. Those online whispers might be true."

Erica grinned softly while swirling her wine glass.Since her stunt didn't go as she expected, she just made sure to twist it into playing right into the rumor mill. These high-society ladies craved drama, and before the night ended, chatter about Hannah and Miles would dominate every conversation.

Felix, still locked in a conversation with a professor regarding a drone prototype, missed the entire incident. Alarmed by the ruckus, he hurried to Hannah."Hannah, are you hurt?"

Hannah gave a slight shake of her head."Nothing happened." Her gaze shifted to Miles, anxiety coloring her voice. "Mr. Whitaker!"

Miles straightened slowly, wine soaking through his shirt, and answered in a steady tone, "I'm alright."

"You should go change," Hannah said, her voice tinged with concern.

With a nod, Miles walked briskly toward the staircase leading up to the VIP dressing rooms.

Upon reaching there, Miles stared at the ruined outfit and dialed his assistant, Kenneth. "I'm in the furthest dressing area upstairs. My suit's ruined. Bring my default dark gray suit here within fifteen. Same brand."

"Understood, Mr. Whitaker!" Kenneth repolied,urgency clear in his voice.

However, after fifteen long minutes, Kenneth was still nowhere in sight. Miles had only managed to pat down the stains with a small towel.
 
Miles' phone buzzed with an incoming call from Kenneth. "Mr. Whitaker, I'm afraid I can't show up anytime soon. I'm trapped in traffic on the way over.It'll take at least another hour."

Miles inhaled slowly, forcing calm into his tone."Fine."

Right before the call ended, Kenneth hesitantly added, "Um, there's a suit in the trunk of the car you drove today. It's the one Ms. Scott gifted you. You asked me to discard it, but I forgot..." His.voice trailed off.

"Alright." Miles ended the call. After standing still a moment, he rang up his chauffeur and requested that the shopping bag be delivered immediately.

The driver arrived promptly, and Miles lifted the dust cover to find a flawless indigo outfit. It included a crisp white dress shirt and a silver-gray tie, still wrapped in bits of packaging film.

When Miles received the outfit months ago, he had dismissed the gesture, his prejudice against Hannah making him cast off anything coming from her. At that time, he had doubted her motives and instructed Kenneth to get rid of it. He never imagined it'd save the day now.

With no alternative, Miles slipped it on. He braced for it to hang awkwardly, but it molded to his frame flawlessly, as if custom-made.

Soon after,Miles walked into the grand hall, exuding poise. He made his way straight to Hannah.

When Hannah spotted him, she exhaled in relief though a flash of recognition flickered in her expression. That outfit looked familiar-something about it stirred her memory.

Felix caught sight of the ensemble and his jaw dropped. He immediately recalled that Hannah had purchased that exact suit.

Right at that moment, Vincent stepped through the entrance beside Connor. They'd previously been in a lengthy discussion about funding contributions.

The moment Vincent stepped in, his attention snapped to the indigo fabric Miles was wearing.The sight stirred something deep and personal in his recollection.
###Chapter 236 Not For Him


The indigo suit, with its distinctive platinum buttons,hit Vincent like a bolt from the blue.

That suit triggered a flood of memories. He could picture it vividly, as if it were yesterday. Hannah had bought that suit.

For the longest time, Vincent had believed she'd chosen it for him. But all the constant arguments and their eventual split had turned everything upside down.

After their divorce, he'd spent ages searching their home for that suit in vain. Once, he'd even wondered if Hannah had taken it with her out of spite during one of their blowups. After all, so much had happened between them, and somewhere along the way, he'd convinced himself she just didn't want him to have it anymore. Still, he never expected to see Miles wearing it. Now that suit's familiar color and fabric felt almost glaring.

A wave of chill swept over Vincent. Was that suit never meant for him? Did Hannah intend it for someone else this entire time?

The thought pierced Vincent's carefully built armor of control, shattering the illusion that any lingering warmth from her was his to claim.

Vincent's hands curled into fists, his knuckles turning pale. Across the room, Hannah and Miles shared an easy conversation, her smile for Miles open and sincere.

Vincent's bitterness mounted. Had Hannah ever looked at hm with that kind of radiant smile? Even back when she'd lost her sight and he devoted himself to her care, that sort of warmth had never been reserved for him.

A shadow passed over Vincent's features as Connor quietly ushered him toward the VIP area.

A server offered Vincent a glass of wine. He knocked it back, chased it with another, and then went for a third, each gulp an attempt to wash away the ache in his chest.

A cluster of business heavyweights, intent on a toast,stopped short, unsettled by the storm brewing in Vincent's eyes.

Erica picked up on the tension radiating from Vincent and chose to remain silently at his side. She hadn't a clue what had triggered him, but one thing was clear.He wasn't looking for conversation.

A full twenty minutes passed before Connor took the microphone, delivering a brief speech before calling out, "Let the dancing begin!"

With a graceful melody flowing from the band,couples drifted onto the dance floor.

Hannah, now a rising name in the business world,became the center of attention almost instantly.

She glided through the crowd in a velvet gown the color of midnight seas, a single diamond necklace catching the light and drawing admiring glances.

A mix of accomplished men, young and old,approached Hannah as her conversation drew to an end.

Felix, standing close, ignored them and flashed her a hopeful grin. "Would you honor me with a dance?"

The air grew thick with tension.

The men hesitated, momentarily thrown off guard.

Felix's hopeful invitation pulled Hannah back to the day he'd confessed his feelings toward her months ago. At that time, she'd turned him down clearly, and now, she didn't want to give him false hope.

That was when Hannah caught movement in her peripheral vision.

Miles stood nearby, deep in conversation with a board member and swirling a glass of champagne.Despite the distance between him and Hannah, when his eyes met hers, a faint, knowing smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. Felix reached out, hoping for her hand, but Hannah pivoted away with effortless poise. "I'm sorry, Felix."

The disbelief on Felix's face lingered as Hannah moved right past him, his disappointment sinking in with each step she took toward Miles.

Without missing a beat, Hannah stopped in front of Miles. Her tone was even, her intent clear. "Mr.Whitaker,would you care to join me for this dance?"

Miles didn't miss a beat. He handed off his champagne, dipped his head in a polite bow, and extended his hand toward her. He bowed slightly,offering his hand. "It would be my honor, Ms. Scott."

Hannah slipped her hand into Miles's, and together they swept across the dance floor, capturing the attention of everyone around them.

Felix's defeat couldn't have been clearer. His smile faded, and he tightened his hold on the glass before gulping down what was left and storming out of the hall. Meanwhile, Vincent stood apart on the terrace,surrounded by top-tier executives engaged in weighty discussions.

He looked the part of a composed mogul, wine glass in hand, until his eyes landed on Hannah and Miles spinning across the floor. In an instant, his grip on the glass tightened, knuckles blanching.

Conversations around him blurred into background noise as his stare grew colder, a hint of bitterness taking over.

Elsewhere, a group of socialites traded hushed gossip."Did you see the way Ms. Scott turned down Mr.Wade? Guess they really are just colleagues."

"And Mr. Whitaker? He stepped in right on cue. If it were me, I'd have picked him, too."

"No chance for the rest of us. My gut says Ms. Scott and Mr. Whitakerare totally an item."

Vincent gulped down his wine, set the empty glass aside, and walked purposefully toward the dance
###Chapter 237 Swapping Partners Mid-dance
The band played a gentle melody as Hannah followed Miles's lead, her dress swirling gracefully with every turn.

Every subtle detail-Hannah's effortless poise, the spark of confidence in her eyes-Vincent noticed all of it. Yet, when his focus dropped to their clasped hands, a flash of something fierce and unsettled crossed his expression, like a storm threatening to break.

Erica stepped closer, offering him a soft smile."Vincent,would you care to dance with me?"

She reached out with her hand, waiting patiently for Vincent's response.

But Vincent didn't even acknowledge her, his gaze locked on Hannah and Miles as they moved across the floor. Without a word, he strode past Erica,making a direct line for the center of the ballroom.

Erica's smile vanished, her cheeks went pale, and she stood frozen, feeling the sting of rejection in front of everyone.

Meanwhile, at the heart of the dance floor, the music drifted on, and Miles kept a respectful space between him and Hannah.

That was when Vincent stepped in. Moving with the authority of someone used to getting what he wanted,he closed the distance. His left hand moved -not abrupt or forceful, but precise and intentional-swiftly swapping Miles's hold for his own.

In a blink, Vincent slipped his hand into Hannah's,seamlessly taking over where Miles had left off. At the same time, his right hand settled firmly against the small of her back,possessive and exact.

The whole transition was effortless-a silent show of command that left no room for argument. Not a single word was needed. Pure, unwaveringpossession radiated from Vincent.

Miles barely had time to react before Hannah was pulled away, swept from his hold by Vincent's undeniable force. Just like that, he was sidelined,reduced to an outsider.

"Pardon us, Mr. Whitaker." Vincent's tone was smooth and quiet, carrying an air of unshakable command, like swapping partners mid-dance was simply how things were done.

Stunned, Hannah suddenly found herself pressed against Vincent's cold, firm chest, a chill mixed with intense pressure wrapping around her.

As soon as their hands met, the storm in Vincent's gaze eased, if only a little.

"Vincent!" Hannah hissed, her words tight with frustration.

"What? Not pleased to see me?" he muttered, his voice barely above a whisper, eyes tracking her every reaction.  Hannah felt like rolling her eyes. No one enjoyed being passed between dance partners without warning.

Hannah started stepping back, purposely throwing off the rhythm Vincent tried to set. With every move,she aimed to make her way back to Miles's side.

But Vincent anticipated every move, closing the gap each time she tried to slip away. His grip tightened,pulling her closer, nearly pinning her to his chest.

Anyone watching would've seen the struggle playing out right in the middle of the dance floor.

"Oh dear!" A woman dressed in a champagne-colored satin gown let out a startled gasp, hand flying to her lips. "Wait, am I seeing this right?Vincent? He's dancing with Hannah? Doesn't he know Hannah is dating Miles?"

"Doesn't Vincent usually avoid these events?" a woman in emerald green remarked, her brows knitting together. "Mr. Jones never sticks around.He always just makes an appearance and disappears.
Tonight, not only is he actually dancing, but he swoopoed in and took Miles's date right in front of everyone..."

The whispers spread like wildfire, stirring up excitement and confusion all at once.

Off to the side, Erica stayed rooted in place, her hands unconsciously balled into fists as she watched everything unfold.

Beneath the dazzling chandelier, the music carried on, soft and elegant.

Vincent kept his arm locked around Hannah's waist,refusing to let her pull away.

As they turned together, Vincent leaned in, his voice barely above a murmur. "Miles makes a fantastic business partner."

His tone was casual, asif he was making small talk about work, his gaze fixed on the swirl at the top of her head rather than her eyes.

Hannah said nothing, allowing him to guide her into a
sharper, more forceful spin.

As the spin ended, the space between them disappeared, forcing Hannah even closer.

Vincent's voice dropped even lower, his breath warm against the curve of her ear. "Lately, I've noticed how closely he's been looking out for you."

He hesitated, searching for the right words."Impressively attentive."

His attention slid downward, settling on her lowered profile.

"And this... The attentiveness he shows-"He swallowed hard, his jaw tense, as if what he was about to say took every ounce of his strength. "Has it gone beyond a strictly professional relationship?"

Hannah's head shot up, eyes blazing with anger."That's quite the question, Mr. Jones," she replied coldly, each syllable razor-sharp.

"Whatever Mr. Whitaker and I have, whatever boundaries exist or don't..." A frosty smile tugged ather lips, devoid of any warmth. "It's not your business anymore-ex-husband."

She made sure to emphasize "ex-husband," letting them cut deeper than anything else she could have said.

A deep line etched itself between Vincent's brows.
###Chapter 238 Faking A Romance With Me

Hannah didn't give Vincent the slightest opening to speak. With a swift, elegant spin, she leaned away,just a hint of distance, yet it felt like she'd placed a canyon between them.

"And you want to talk about attentiveness?" Her tone shifted back to its former composure, though now it carried a frostier bite. "Mr. Jones, you've been navigating boardrooms for years. Surely you understand what really earns trust between partners."

Her eyes locked onto Vincent's, unflinching and bold."It's about respecting boundaries-knowing to stay out of someone's personal affairs. Not-" She paused pointedly, glancing at his possessive hold on her before letting her voice cut with cold sarcasm."Not masking interrogations as casual business chat.Not dragging your ex-wife into a public scene just to chase down nonsense rumors about her private life."
Vincent's eyes lit up as he caught the most important detail. "Wait, you and Miles aren't actually dating?"

A frown tugged at Hannah's brow. "Absolutely not."
Her days were packed from dawn till dusk that she barely had a moment to spare, let alone for romance.

She shot back her answer, firm and unwavering. It was enough to steady the turmoil inside Vincent. The tension in his expression eased. His furrowed brow relaxed.

As the music neared its end, Vincent stopped moving, but he didn't let go of Hannah's waist. They were close enough now to feel each other's breath.

Other couples danced on, but the two of them stood still, an island at the center of the floor.

Some in the crowd exchanged confused looks. "If that's all it is, a rumor, why not set the record straight?" Vincent's words came out in a rush, his breath mingling with hers.

They were far too close.

Hannah found herself unable to break free. She shot him a sharp glance and then gave a brittle laugh."Set the record straight?"

Her lips twisted into a chilly, practiced smile. "Mr.Jones, can't you see? I'm just starting out in business..."

Her gaze flicked to his arm, her words edged with a cool,matter-of-fact logic. "A little chatter and some harmless rumors-free publicity at its finest. What's the downside?"

She tipped her head, eyes glacial and remote."Isn't it the easiest,cheapest marketing there is?"

Vincent, however, replied seriously, "That's not true."His voice carried a note of sharp assessment.

Hannah's brows knit together. "Why?" Vincent dipped his head, a hint of an amused smile tugging at his lips. "You're after publicity, right? As your ex-husband and the head of Jones Group..." He let the words hang, almost daring her to challenge him. "Wouldn't getting involved with me be a far better headline than with Miles?"

Hannah stared at him, genuinely thrown, a crease deepening on her forehead. "Are you listening to yourself right now?"

Vincent pressed on as if he hadn't heard. "Think about it-a man branded as 'the ex-husband left behind by the new business queen. The tabloids would eat it up, and the buzz would be nonstop. You want a cost-effective way to boost your name? I'm the best marketing tool you've got." His smile broadened, as though he was pitching a flawless plan.

"So tell me-" Vincent's gaze locked on hers,lingering for emphasis. "You want to go ahead with faking a romance with me?" he asked.

What? Hannah froze, completely blindsided. Her eyes went wide, and her whole body stiffened in his arms. "Have you lost your mind?"

She couldn't fathom it. What was all this about playing the part of a scorned ex-husband, and how could Vincent even say something so ridiculous? And since when did the CEO of Jones Group get tangled up in gossip like this?

"I'm not losing it," Vincent replied, his deep voice putting a stop to her protest.

"But there's something worse-" His throat tightened as he spoke. "To watch the tabloids pair you with Miles, painting the two of you as if you're some perfect match... This is driving me insane!"

A flicker of hurt flashed in his eyes, as if old wounds had split open. He let out a slow, shaky breath. "Do you have any idea wvhat these last two months have been like for me?"

After their blow-up and he'd cooled down, he'd promised himself he wouldn't reach out. Just another woman, he told himself-he was likely to have no trouble moving on. Her sight had returned, and there was no more responsibility tying him down. They were divorced. They were supposed to go their separate ways.

For two months, he kept his word, refusing to call or message Hannah. He thought it would be a simple thing to move on from her. Instead,he caught himself scouring articles online, searching for any mention of their names together.

Even now, at the university celebration, he could have simply made a donation and skipped the event.But he came in person. Because he knew Hannah would be here. He couldn't explain what had compelled him, but the pull was impossible to ignore.

Hannah looked up at him, searching his face, her voice edged with disbelief. "Are you actually jealous?"

But how could Vincent be jealous because of her?
###Chapter 239 He Avoided The Question

Jealousy? Vincent always saw himself as above emotional entanglements, certain he could maintain his composure even when it came to matters of the heart.

Even when Hannah had been constantly surrounded by admirers before their marriage, he had never let it get to him because he trusted that her heart belonged to him alone.

But somewhere along the line, the sight of other men around Hannah began to gnaw at him. It started with Felix entering Hannah's world while she was still his wife.Back then, though, he only felt mild annoyance.

After their divorce, something in him changed.

Whether it was Felix's open declaration of love or the relentless gossip tying Hannah to Miles, Vincent found himself trapped in a whirlwind of emotions he couldn't control. He hated the feeling. After all, he'd built his life around control, and this left him rattled.

Right then, the final notes of the music faded away.

Vincent's hand fell away, and Hannah slipped from his grasp at last. The question about jealousy hung unanswered, but it no longer mattered to her.

The gala pressed on, and Vincent stood by, his gaze cold and distant as he watched Hannah walk away.



In the days that followed, Hannah immersed herself in work, determined to leave everything else behind.

Things mostly ran smoothly, except for one hitch.Felix kept avoiding her.

Hannah knew he was still smarting from what happened at the dance. Her rejection had been unmistakable, and there wasn't much more she could say. At a company meeting, Nova Tech began discussing the push for international growth, which meant sending team members abroad to open up new markets.

Expanding into overseas markets was nno small feat,and it would demand years of effort, not just months.

When Hannah first brought up the idea, the room fell silent. She understood why. Uprooting one's life for work was no small ask.

Right as Hannah was about to suggest tabling the discussion for another day, Felix, quiet until now,suddenly broke his silence. "I'll go."

The whole room turned, caught off guard.

Felix's voice rang out again, steadier this time. ＂門handle the foreign markets."

Hannah looked over at him, searching his face."Have you thought it through?" He gave a firm nod. "Yes." For a moment, Hannah weighed her options. From a purely business standpoint, Felix was talented and gutsy, the obvious choice for the job. She quickly made the decision. "Alright, it's settled then. Let's wrap up for today."

The decision was made so quickly that it left everyone else in the meeting momentarily stunned before they slowly began filing out.

Rising from her seat, Hannah offered Felix a supportive pat on the shoulder. "Safe travels. You'll do great."

"| figured you'd try to talk me out of it," Felix said quietly as Hannah was already halfway to the door.

Hannah paused for a moment, silent, and then continued on without a word.

Felix remained behind, a faint, bitter smile playing on his lips.

When the day of Felix's departure arrived, senior staff from both Nova Tech and Polaris Tech gathered at the airport to see him off.

Felix bid them farewell, lingering at the gate until the last possible moment.

Everyone there could tell who Felix was really hoping to see, but in the end, she never showed.

Some distance away, Hannah watched the scene unfold, standing apart from the group and out of their sight.

Her assistant, unable to hold back tears, sniffled beside her. "Ms. Scott, aren't you going to miss him?"

"We're not saying goodbye forever. I'm proud of him -he's headed toward bigger opportunities." Hannah watched Felix disappear into the boarding tunnel,silently wvishing him success from afar.

As soon as he was gone, Hannah put on her sunglasses and pivoted without a second thought."Let's get moving. There's work to be done."

Nova Tech had just rolled out their latest project-a smart athletic wear line called "VelaCore." Hannah had set up a meeting to pitch it to the Fontaine Galleria's procurement director. On the green at an exclusive Dorbarrow club,dressed in a clean white athletic outfit, Hannah strode beside Forrest Acosta of Fontaine Galleria as they made their way down the seventh fairway.

Forrest tried to sound authoritative, clinging to tired industry clichés. "Ms. Scott, our analysis shows that men still drive most purchases in luxury lingerie.They care more about looks than comfort. Maybe your brand is targeting the wrong buyers?"

As Forrest shared some investigated data, Hannah listened without interruption. "Mr. Acosta." She didn't rush to counter, focusing first on her swing, smooth and effortless, as the golf ball soared in a flawless arc toward the flag.

Her words were even, yet unmistakably firm. "Your interpretation of the data is methodical but lacks precision." Forrest's gaze instinctively shifted elsewhere.

Picking up on his line of sight, Hannah paused,stopping just ahead of him. "Forgive my bluntness,Mr.Acosta, but the way you're quoting statistics and the fact that you haven't really engaged with the product make me question whether you actually have final say on this partnership."

A sharp, knowing smile curved on her lips. "Maybe I'd be better off discussing this with the gentleman waiting at the ninth pavilion, the one who actually understands the real market challenges?"

This strategy was one she'd picked up from Vincent:always follow the real decision-maker.

As their conversation unfolded, she couldn't help but notice Forrest fumbling over statistics, setting off warning bells in her mind. Moreover, throughout the match, his eyes kept drifting toward the ninth pavilion, and in that instant, everything clicked for her.

Eventually, Hannah received an invitation to meet there. When she arrived and started to introduce herself, the man inside turned, slid off his sunglasses, and offered a knowing smile.

Hannah's breath caught-of all people, it was him?
###Chapter 240 You Always Surprise Me


"Claude." The name slipped from Hannah before she could catch herself.

Her chest tightened with a rush of emotion-never in her wildest dreams did she imagine the Fontaine Galleria deal would bring her face-to-face with Claude Hobbes, the once adopted son of the Scott family.

She remembered how, at ten years old, Claude had left to reunite with his biological parents. After that,he'd vanished from her world.

Now, standing before her, Claude was nothing like the boy she once knew. He wore a sharp, custom suit that only amplified his tall, commanding presence.

Hannah quickly masked her shock, shifting into her polished, professional persona.

Claude's eyes narrowed ever so slightly at the sound of his name. A visible thrill swept through him, a slow,satisfied smile curving his lips. "Anna," he murmured,his voice deep and rich, laced with old affection."Finally got to see you again. After all these years."

He rose and closed the distance between them with deliberate steps.

Hannah's keen gaze caught a familiar quirk-his right thumb absently rubbing his index finger, the same old nervous habit from childhood. She found herself staring at someone both intimately familiar and strangely changed.

"Mr. Hobbes," Hannah began crisply, bringing the conversation back to business. "This wasn't what l expected, but I trust you've seen VelaCore's numbers and proposal. VelaCore's getting into Fontaine Galleria would benefit us both."

She was ready to dive into her pitch when he cut her off with an easy, offhand comment. "Don't rush,Anna."

Claude stopped right in front of her, eyes studying every detail of her face. "It's been over a decade,Anna." There was a bittersweet warmth in his voice."How are your parents?"

"They're doing well," Hannah replied, her composure unshaken. "They've retired, and life is peaceful for them now."

Her answer was measured, emotions carefully kept in check, but Claude's eyes hinted at something deeper. "I'm glad to hear that," he replied quietly.

"Back then, I didn't have a real choice. Leaving wasn't what I wanted, and I still owe the Scott family an apology." He took another step closer, regret clouding his gaze.

Conflicting feelings flickered through Hannah, and her tone softened just a little. "That's all in the past now. My parents never held it against you. Mr.Hobbes, let's get back to business."

"Just call me Claude," Claude insisted, his tone suddenly firm, almost commanding. He met Hannah's eyes with a faint, challenging smile. "'Mr. Hobbes' sounds far too distant."

Hannah hesitated, instinctively aware that the name blurred boundaries, but quickly composed herself.It was just a name. No biggie.

"Claude," she said, her gaze steady as she reclaimed her poise. "Let's dive into our brand project..."

She steered the conversation sharply back to the main point.

"Absolutely, we can talk about the project," Claude interjected with a low chuckle, his pace unhurried."But how we discuss it is up to me. Fontaine Galleria isn't in the business of giving handouts.I'll need solid evidence that both VelaCore and you, Anna, are truly aligned with Fontaine Galleria's values."

Hannah's eyes narrowed in wary suspicion. "Mr.Hobbes... Claude, what exactly are you suggesting?"

He leaned in, eyes alight with a predator's thrill."We're standing on a golf course. Let's settle it right here. A single hole decides the winner." His grin was downright mesmerizing. "If you come out on top, I'll personally make sure your brand gets a prime spot in Fontaine Galleria, with the best terms possible."' He let the moment linger, clearly enjoying Hannah's reaction. "But if you lose, then you spend dinner with me every night for a month. Just you and me." His voice dropped to a low, teasing, slow speech, making it clear his interest in her went beyond the project itself.

Hannah weighed his proposal for only a second before nodding with conviction. "You've got yourself a deal. We'lI do as you said."

After a quick warmup, they each found their spot on the course, ready for the challenge ahead.

Claude's swing was smooth and confident, his ball landing in a spot that would give anyone pause.

He moved aside, never taking his eyes off Hannah.Finally, the woman who'd haunted his thoughts was within arm's reach, and he could hardly hide his excitement. Staying composed, Hannah took her time analyzing the distance, the contours of the green, and the pace of the turf. She selected her putter, dropped into her stance, and centered her breathing.

Her technique was flawless, controlled, practiced,and self-assured. With a clean strike, she sent the ball rolling.

It clicked neatly against the cup and dropped in wvith a single putt.

"I won." Hannah handed off her club to the caddy,a hint of a smile tugging at her lips. "Shall we talk about that contract?"

Claude met her gaze, grinning wider. "Anna, you always surprise me."
###Chapter 241 She Never Lacked Male Admirers


Hannah's victory was nothing but the result of her own lovesick determination. Back then, she'd thrown herself into golf solely for Vincent-blowing through her savings on private lessons,only to face his rejection of her advances every single time.

At first, she'd only wanted to master the basics. But Vincent's infuriating indifference had driven her to hammer ball after ball down the fairway, turning every swing into an outlet for her frustration. Before she knew it, her persistence had transformed her into a natural.

After the contract was signed without a hitch, Hannah made to leave, but Claude insisted on giving her a ride back. No matter how many times she declined, he simply wouldn't take no for an answer. So, she found herself gliding through the city in Claude's glossy black luxury car as it cruised toward Sterling Heights.

Hannah leaned her head back and shut her eyes, quietly resting while Claude stole glances at her from the driver's seat.

The car eventually rolled to a gentle stop at her building.

"I'm home. Thank you-really." Hannah unclipped her seatbelt,hand already on the door handle.

Claude had already stepped out, the perfect gentleman,swinging the car door open with a practiced flourish.

Hannah slid out, standing across from him just as a soft breeze swept past, carrying a tiny leaf that settled in her hair.

Claude's eyes immediately caught the stray leaf. He lifted his hand on instinct, but before his fingers brushed her, Hannah's
hand on instinct. but before his fingers brushed her. Hannah's gaze flickered upward-she unconsciously edged away from him.She'd lost the habit of accepting his casual tenderness. Those easy, wordless moments between them were relics of a childhood closeness now buried by years apart.

Claude's hand faltered, hovering awkwardly mid-air. Was she avoiding him? For a heartbeat, disappointment and unspoken frustration tightened his handsome features. Was she really so guarded with him now?

Instead of retreating, Claude pressed on, his movements brisk and deliberate as he deftly plucked the leaf from her hair. He spoke quietly, his voice tight with suppressed anger as he twirled the leaf between his fingers. "It's just a leaf. It landed in your hair."

Hannah offered him a courteous, distant smile. "Thank you,
Claude."

She was ready to leave when Claude's question cut through the air. "Have you held it against me all these years?"

A shadow crossed Claude's eyes.

Hannah met his gaze, steady and unflinching. "That's all behind us now, Claude." There had been bitterness once, back when they'd gone their separate ways, but she'd let it go.

"My parents must be so happy seeing how well you're doing these days," she added, her expression softening into a genuine smile.

Claude felt a stir in his heart. He pressed his words gently but firmly. "Anna, please send my regards to them. Don't forget...We're still family."

"I will," Hannah promised, her voice steady as she turned around and walked off.

Derek lifted the leaf to his nose, inhaling the faint scent of her
Derek lifted the leaf to his nose, inhaling the faint scent of her hair-an intimate memory that sent a sharp ache through him.A beat later, he crushed the brittle leaf in his palm, the gesture tight and resolute, shadows falling across his face. What happened just now was nothing more than an inconsequential Chapter. Surely, he and Hannah could find their way back to how things used to be. They had to. 1

Inside a car parked nearby, a soft metallic flick broke the silence as a lighter snapped open somewhere in the shadows.

The rear window of the sleek SUV glided down a crack,letting in the night air.

Vincent snapped the lid shut on his polished silver lighter, the gesture oddly final. He should have gone home, but instead,he'd told Derek to drive to Hannah's apartment complex.

From the darkness, Vincent had watched everything play out.His control had wavered-emotion surging in his chest,threatening to drown out reason. He knew the man on sight: Claude, the sharp-eyed new director of Fontaine Galleria.

Hannah had spoken to Claude-used his name, her voice carrying just enough warmth to make Vincent's hands clench in his lap.

Vincent was simmering with frustration. Hannah was always quick to accuse him of being swarmed by women, but in truth,she never lacked male admirers herself. First Felix, and now Claude-her ever-changing circle was nothing short of impressive.

Vincent had sorted out his relationship with Hannah, at least that was what he thought. He told himself it wasn't jealousy knotting his chest. The root of his volatility was their divorce That was why he'd crafted a reconciliation proposal, biding his time, searching for the right moment to hand it over.

If his previous attempts at remarriage had been for the sake of
If his previous attempts at remarriage had been for the sake of his grandmother's wishes, this time, he wanted it for himself.Remarrying could set everything back on track.

Yet,the proposal stayed tucked away, undelivered. The scene he'd just witnessed had thrown his hard-won composure into chaos all over again.

Derek, unsteady from his fever, caught sight of Vincent's stormy expression and ventured, "Want me to go get her?"

Since returning from medical leave, Derek had shadowed Vincent day and night, privy to the reconciliation proposal tucked away, waiting for its moment.

The ex-couple hadn't contacted each other in over two months, which had made things tough for Derek. He was forced to update Vincent on Hannah's every move. By now,he could have drawn a map to her apartment from memory.

But Vincent stayed silent, eyes distant.

"Mr. Jones?" Derek tried again, voice tentative.

Vincent's throat bobbed in the rearview, his reply clipped."Let's go."

Claude slightly turned his body, watching the luxury SUV drive away. A dry,amused laugh escaped him. "So that's Anna's ex-husband. What are the odds... I bet his expression is a sight to behold."

With a flick of his wrist, Claude seized another leaf and crushed it between his fingers, the veins snapping beneath his grip.
###Chapter 242 Remarriage Agreement

"Mom, Dad, I bumped into Claude today," Hannah mentioned while slipping on her slippers at the door.

"Claude?" Raymond glanced up, his spectacles sliding lower on his nose with astonishment. "That boy from the Hobbes family?Hasn't he been out of touch for a long time?"

Margaret's look held mixed emotions. "Is everything alright with him?"

Hannah settled between her mother and father on the couch,holding a throw pillow close. "He's actually thriving. He's now running Fontaine Galleria. We spoke about a future joint venture today."

"I had a hunch there was more going on with his background when his actual dad arrived to collect him at that time,"Raymond said.

Margaret exhaled slowly. "He went through so much back then after his mom abandoned him. Living on the streets at five...It's good to see him rise above that."

"Come on, let's have dinner first!"

***

In the study of the Jones family estate, Vincent stood silently with his back to the door, facing the towering glass panel. His whiskey tumbler had long since been empty.

A gentle knock sounded, and the door opened with a slight creak.

Erica stepped in, carrying a dainty white porcelain bowl
Erica stepped in, carrying a dainty white porcelain bowl."Vincent, drinking alone at this hour?" she asked softly. "I heard you didn't touch your meal, so l prepared some broth. It's best while still warm."

She set the tray on a corner of the large table, her eyes habitually scanning the room. Her eyes landed briefly on a file resting nearby, though she couldn't make out its contents.

A feeling inside warned Erica that it held weight.

Vincent, deep in thought, scowled faintly at the intrusion but didn't shift.

Erica moved with careful steps toward the file. "Skipping dinner isn't good for your health..."

Her tone was gentle, pretending to adjust the tray while drawing nearer to the chair.

All at once, she appeared to lose her footing, gasping as the tray lurched! The porcelain shattered on impact, spilling hot liquid across the ornate rug.

"Oh! I... I didn't mean to-I'll fix this immediately," Erica blurted,her voice breaking with emotion. Amid the mess, her eyes caught a few words on te sheet-"remarriage agreement",and Hannah's name stood out.

The noise dragged Vincent from his daze, and he pivoted around abruptly. "Leave!"

"I'm going! I'll clean it and go right now!" Erica quivered,frantically dabbing the floor, nearly running out of the study,softly pulling the door shut.

But her expression turned icy the instant the latch clicked.

Once inside her bedroom, a wave of shadow swept over her features. Remarry? Her scream was silent, but the jealousy in her gaze burned like fire. Was Vincent planning to remarry
her gaze burned like fire. Was Vincent planning to remarry Hannah?

Erica's nails pressed into her palms, thoughts spiraling about how long she'd waited to become his bride, hoping endlessly for the day she would claim the title of Mrs. Jones.

She had stood by as Vincent split from Hannah and Brinley's imprisonment. Surely, now was her time to ascend as Mrs.Jones. He wanted to remarry Hannah? Not a chance. She had to act. She couldn't delay any further.

At 3:30 a.m., clad only in a sheer silk slip, Erica hesitated outside Vincent's bedroom. She eased the handle-the door moved. Victory! He hadn't locked it.

Erica's chest swelled with glee as she stepped in, gently closing the entrance behind her.

Adrenaline surged through her veins, heat rising to her cheeks.She reached the mattress-only to find it vacant. So, Vincent was still in the study?

Acting swiftly, she returned to the study. Just as she guessed,he was resting there.

She quietly lifted the duvet and slipped under it, letting her gown fall beside the bed. When morning came, the game would be hers.

By sunrise, she held onto the covers as if anchoring herself,rising to a seated position, weeping. "Oh... Vincent, how could you... How could you betray me like this... I'm your aunt! How can I face anyone after this..."

She embraced the role of a heartbroken woman flawlessly.

The sobbing brought Danica first, who, hearing a woman inside Vincent's study, turned the knob and was surprised it was unlocked. She froze upon seeing the room's contents and then quickly instructed a servant to summon Sharon.
Sharon entered moments later, assisted by Aubrey. her demeanor stern. "What's happening in here?"

Erica, face wet with tears, opened her mouth to answer-then noticed the man next to her stirring. She turned her face away,continuing to cry.

A strange male voice, sleepy and confused, cut through the tension. It wasn't Vincent!

Erica went still, her entire body numbing.
###Chapter 243 | Won't Care For Your Answer


Derek gaped at the woman who had materialized at his bedside.Clutching his bathrobe sash in a white-knuckled grip, he scrambled backward until his shoulders pressed against the headboard. "M-Ms. Stanton?" His voice wavered. "How on earth did you even make it in here?"

A charged silence crackled in the air.

Just moments before, Erica's wails had filled the room-and now, her sobs cut off as suddenly as they'd begun.

Erica's face was frozen in confusion, her eyes wide. How did things end up like this? Was Vincent not the one who had been in the study?

Sharon's brows drew together as she recognized Derek,her voice pitched with incredulity. "Derek-how did you end up in Vincent's study, and where's Vincent?”

Still dazed, Derek struggled to piece together a response. "I-I brought some documents to Mr. Jones last night. I had a fever and felt pretty out of it, so l ended up giving him the wrong ones. Mr. Jones went in person, and afterwards I was allowed to rest quietly in the study..." His voice trailed off into a whisper.

Erica's face burned, and she squeezed the blanket closer, her knuckles white with mortification.

Sharon struck her cane sharply against the floor, her tone brooking no argument. "No one is to mention what happened here today."

The servants bowed their heads. "Understood."
"Out. All of you."

Flustered, Derek and the servants scurried out of the study.

Once the room emptied, Sharon turned her piercing gaze on Erica."Erica,come into my room."

Erica nodded faintly. "Alright."

As Sharon reached the door, a series of wild, desperate screams echoed from inside, punctuated by heavy thuds against the wall. She stopped and let out a long, weary sigh.



At dawn, Vincent did something out of character-he invited Miles over for coffee.

Before the coffee maker had even finished sputtering, Vincent cut straight to the point. "Tell me-what's Claude Hobbes's connection to Hannah?"

Miles raised an eyebrow. Vincent's behavior was unmistakably off. Vincent hadn't spoken a word to him in more than two months,barely acknowledging him at the recent ball. But now,out of nowhere, Vincent summoned him for coffee at the crack of dawn, only to interrogate him about another man.

Miles sipped his coffee slowly, his voice flat. "All I know is Nova Tech's new product just made it into Fontaine Galleria. That's it.I've got nothing else."

That lined up perfectly with what Vincent had managed to dig up-just that single thread.

Vincent pressed his lips together in a thin, unreadable line.

Miles continued, "Polaris Tech's shareholders' meeting is this afternoon. Are you showing up?"

"I'll be there." Vincent held a modest three percent of Polaris
"I'll be there." Vincent held a modest three percent of Polaris Tech's stock-a stake he'd acquired directly from Miles.

This meeting was the first for shareholders since Polaris Tech restructured its organization.

The afternoon soon arrived. The building hummed with activity as shareholders trickled in, mingling in hushed, cautious clusters.

Hannah swept through the lobby in a tailored off-white suit,every inch the picture of cold composure as she ushered a board member toward the meeting room.

Mid-stride, she suddenly froze. Her gaze darted across the crowd, locking onto a familiar face-Vincent.

Vincent lingered just a few steps from the doors, alone-no assistant trailing after him, no entourage in sight.

Hannah arched a brow, a flicker of surprise crossing her face.What on earth was Vincent doing here? Polaris Tech and Jones Group's core business weren't even remotely related!

She quickly smoothed away her reaction, drawing in a steadying breath and arranging a calm, professional smile as she strode toward him. "Mr. Jones, are you here to see Mr. Whitaker?"

Vincent shook his head, his expression unreadable. "No. I came for the shareholders' meeting." His tone was calm and flat without a hint of emotion.

Yet, in that instant, Hannah keenly picked up on the information -he was a Polaris Tech shareholder. When had that even happened? But it was irrelevant now-he was standing right in front of her.

She held onto her pleasant smile, letting a touch of gentle curiosity slip into her voice. "Really/? So you're betting big on Polaris Tech, Mr. Jones?"

"The people here seem pretty decent." His answer was
"The people here seem pretty decent." His answer was intentionally vague, giving nothing away as he strolled into the meeting room.

Hannah's brows drew together. What on earth was that supposed to mean? Still, she kept her composure, locking away the rush of doubts spinning through her mind. For now,all that mattered was pulling off today's shareholders' meeting without a hitch.

Nearly every seat around the expansive circular table had been claimed.

Hannah acknowledged Miles with a subtle nod, her attention quickly catching on Vincent-already settled in a seat that managed to be both discreet and impossible to ignore.

Vincent's gaze stayed trained on the summary of Polaris Tech's latest financial report, his features sharp with icy concentration.

On the towering projection screen, vivid concept art for Polaris Tech's next flagship game, "Celestial Voyage," glowed above the room.

Hannah stepped forward, her voice unwavering as she laid out the company's strategic roadmap for the year ahead, every word crisp and assured.

A scatter of polite applause drifted from one end of the table."Impressive pitch, Ms. Scott. Ambitious, to say the least. But..."

The recent speaker, Keenan Castillo, who controlled five percent of Polaris Tech, let his words hang in the air,savoring the sudden hush and the way every eye swung toward Hannah.

"If I may speak frankly, gaming is a relentless, cutthroat arena,"Keenan said, his voice dripping with arrogance. "Women might have a knack for the small stuff, but let's face it-when it
have a knack for the small stuff, but let's face it-when it comes to making tough calls and handling pressure, they're just not up to the task."

The meeting room was consumed by tension.

Hannah's team bristled, and Miles's expression darkened.

Hannah's easy smile evaporated, replaced by a steely glint.Her tone stayed calm, even edged with dry amusement. "Mr.Castillo, are you implying that my gender somehow makes me unfit to lead this company? Even though I spearheaded the development of 'Threshold: Echoes'-the blockbuster game that raked in billions for us?"

Keenan drew breath to retort, but Hannah hed up a hand,slicing across his words. "Don't bother, Mr. Castillo. I already know I won't care for your answer."
###Chapter 244 Is That Your Boyfriend

Hannah's voice carried a steady authority as her gaze cut across the room. "Polaris Tech stands for relentless innovation and true breakthroughs. What drives us isn't gender-it's vision,technology, and the courage to push boundaries."

She leaned in, the quiet force of her presence impossible to ignore. "If anyone here refuses to accept that basic truth,maybe they shouldn't have a seat at this table."

Keenan's cheeks flushed crimson, but before he could spit out a comeback, another shareholder jumped in, anxious to support Keenan. "Ms. Scott, let's be fair-Mr. Castillo just wants what's best for the company. XR tech might sound exciting,but do you realize how massive an investment it'll take? There are real technical obstacles, and what if we pour all our resources in and get nothing back? Isn't it smarter to stick with safe, proven games that turn a profit, instead of charging headlong into something this risky?"

Hannah was ready to dismantle their shallow objections with hard data, but a steady, low voice cut through the tension. "It's normal to have doubts about investment."

It was none other than Vincent. He set his booklet aside,leaning in just enough to command the room's attention. His previous words had reassured the shareholders with a measured tone, but then a cold edge crept into his tone. "But that kind of thinking is limited-deeply shortsighted."

He glanced at Hannah, his eyes distant, as if seeing beyond her to something further. "Investing in this technology is like pouring the concrete for a skyscraper's foundation. Sure, it eats up resources, takes time, and you can't see the final
eats up resources, takes time, and you can't see the final structure yet. You're right about that."

He let the words settle and then fired off the blow, sharp and final. "But while you're hesitating, others will have already built sky-high. If you're still stuck on the foundation then,it'll be far too late."

A razor-thin smile flickered across his face, sharp and dismissive. "By that point, all you'll be able to do is stand by and watch everyone else cash in."

His gaze sliced through the crowd-intense, self-assured, and just a touch disdainful-as he delivered his final verdict."Getting in now isn't just bold. It's strategic. If you sit back and wait for opportunity to knock, aren't you just setting yourself up to lose?"

A wave of discomfort swept through the room. Beads of sweat broke out on more than one shareholder's brow.

Vincent's blunt words landed like stones, shattering the group's composure and sending quiet shockwaves through the assembled shareholders.

Hannah felt a jolt of surprise-his logic mirrored her own,yet he'd managed to strip it down to something devastatingly clear.Vincent's sharp instincts and strategic vision, hisgift for analysis and smooth, effortless rhetoric-none of that could be denied,no matter how tangled her personal feelings had become.

The last time she'd heard him share his insights with this kind of precision and conviction, she'd still been blind, left to judge the world by sound alone. He was more than just the affluent,untouchable CEO of the Jones Group; beneath the title, he was a force to be reckoned with-a man whose talent made others fade into the background.

Hannah drew in a slow, steadying breath, taming the turmoil beneath her cool exterior. She dipped her head to Vincent in
beneath her cool exterior. She dipped her head to Vincent in subtle acknowledgment. "Mr. Jones's perspectiveis exceptionally sharp."

There was no need to heap on praise. The sentiment carried itself in the air between them.

Without missing a beat, she turned to address the rest of the shareholders, her tone crisp and authoritative as she smoothly guided the meeting forward.



The meeting with the shareholders was finally over.

Hannah gathered the last document, pausing when she caught Vincent's figure still looming by the expansive window.

He remained motionless, outlined in the fading light-his broad shoulders and rigid stance radiated a quiet dominance that was impossible to ignore.

After a calming breath, she walked over,pausing just behind him.Basic courtesy demanded she acknowledge him, no matter what lingered between them.′′Mr. Jones, you're still here?"she asked softly.

Vincent's voice carried a detached chill. "I'm waiting for someone."

"Thank you for your help today," Hannah remarked, meeting his gaze head-on-her eyes clear, her tone direct,unwilling to hide behind pleasantries.

Vincent's tone remained calm and unruffled. "I'm merely pointingout the facts."

Before Hannah could respond, her phone vibrated in her suit pocket. The alert pierced the silence. Reflexively, she slid a hand into her pocket and grabbed her phone.
She tapped the screen to unlock it, the glow lighting up her features. Out of the corner of his eye, Vincent caught the sender's name-Claude.

Claude had asked Hannah out for dinner later.

Before Hannah could type her response, Vincent's low,enigmatic voice slipped in from her side. "Is that your boyfriend?"

She hesitated, a faint ripple of surprise in her eyes, but recovered almost instantly. "Mr. Jones, is my personal life really that fascinating to you?"

Vincent met her gaze head-on, stepping closer until she could feel the weight of his presence. "Fascinating? Not quite."

His voice dropped, quiet and indifferent. "I just want to make sure you aren't inviting unnecessary trouble,Ms.Scott.After all..."

He let the silence stretch for a moment and then added with a measured smile, "Because whether you like it or not-we're a little more entangled than before."

A subtle crease appeared between Hannah's brows as uncertainty flickered across her face. "There's nothing between us."

A teasing glimmer lit his gaze. "The connection I mean is-" he murmured, closing the space between them, "I'm a Polaris Tech shareholder now. Did you think I was hinting at something else?"

Color bloomed on Hannah's cheeks, caught off guard by his answer. She quickly sidestepped, taking a few steps forward to put several feet between them.

He pivoted, his face unreadable as he warned in a low, even tone, "Be careful around Claude Hobbes. The man's always scheming, never showing his hand. You'd be wise to keep your distance."
###Chapter 245 Too Close

Most days, if Hannah had heard Vincent talk like that, she would have lost her patience right away and thought he was butting in again. But today, in a surprisingly good mood,she found herself with more patience than usual.

With a spark of interest, she asked, "Why do you ask? Did you have an issue with Claude? Did he offend the Jones Group?"

A flicker of tension appeared along Vincent's jaw, while something stormier darkened his eyes. "In business, clashing interests are just part of the game," he replied, letting his voice drop to something low and intense. "The real reason is..."

He paused, either searching for the right words or trying to push down whatever was swirling inside him.

Suddenly, his thoughts jumped to Claude gently brushing a stray leaf from Hannah's hair, and the soft way she called his name.

"He's standing too close," Vincent finally remarked, his voice rough,letting out the vaguest answer.

His roundabout response struck Hannah as funny, so her curiosity took a lighter turn. She turned to him with eyes that sparkled. "Then tell me, Mr. Jones, how much space do you consider safe? Is this far enough?"

She paused,moving in a step, her gaze flicking to the tension in his jaw. "Or this distance?"

"All too close," Vincent murmured, barely loud enough to hear,grinding the words out between his teeth.

"Really?" Hannah looked genuinely entertained, and a bright,chilly smile stretched across her lips. Instead of pulling away,
chilly smile stretched across her lips. Instead of pulling away,she leaned a bit closer, using the moment to meet his eyes."So, Mr. Jones, you're aware this is crossing the line?"

Drawing out her words on purpose, she let every syllable hang in the air. "I still remnember the ball that night. You wouldn't let go of my waist the entire time we danced. Every spin brought your nose right up to my ear, and with each step, your breath warmed my skin. Why didn't you think that was too close at the time?"

Her eyes grew sharper, throwing his double standards right back at him.

Vincent didn't flinch. "That's a different situation," he replied.lt was true. Dancing did mean being up close

But what he forgot was that he had claimed her as a dance partner precisely because of the close contact between her and Miles.

Hannah replied without missing a beat, "No, it isn't different."

That night, she'd felt like his captive, his arms locking her to his chest. So close that there was hardly any space left between them.

Vincent sidestepped the topic of the ball, starting anew. "Even with a safe distance, anyone can cross it if they want to. One step is all it takes, especially when you have no idea where the other person's boundaries are."

"Claude isn't like that," Hannah retorted, lifting her chin, her confidence steady and unshaken. "I know I'm not wrong about him. He would never hurt me. I trust him on that."

Even if years had passed since they last spoke, she valued the connection they'd built together as kids.

Vincent pressed his lips into a hard, cold line, watching her closely. He meant only to warn her, yet she had so much faith
closely. He meant only to warn her, yet she had so much faith in that man.

Without letting him say anything else, Hannah took charge, her voice calm once more. "The meeting is over, so if you'll excuse me,Mr. Jones."

While she spoke, she moved toward the meeting room door.She had just turned the handle when Miles appeared, ready to walk in.

Stopping for a moment, she asked, "Mr. Whitaker, did you need something from me?"

Miles answered with a shake of his head, "No, I'm actually here to see Mr. Jones."

"| see." It became clear to her that Vincent had been waiting for Miles. She offered Miles a brief nod before making her way out of the room.

Miles stayed by the doorway, watching Hannah as she walked away, his mind lost in thought. He realized Vincent must have sent him out earlier just to speak with Hannah alone. Turning to Vincent, he asked, "Did you get everything sorted out?"

Vincent continued to gaze out the floor-to-ceiling window."Yes."

Miles stayed put, not coming any farther into the room. "Shall we head out?"

"Who is Claude to Hannah, really?" Vincent asked, not turning around, his mood clearly heavy.

With a faint frown, Miles replied, "I believe I already told you.He's in charge of Fontaine Galleria, and he's working with Ms.Scott through a partnership agreement."

"You're sure it's nothing more than business?" Vincent asked,pushing for more.
Miles didn't say anything in response.

"Let's go," Vincent said, leaving the meeting room with Miles.
###Chapter 246 | Stole Your Wife


Hannah exited the elevator, fatigue slamming into her like a collapsing wall. Convincing those shareholders had left her completely depleted.

As she made her way through the spinning glass, she caught sight of a gentle mist beginning to descend.

Her vehicle was undergoing service, so she reached into her purse to summon an Uber. A voice reached her before she could tap the screen. "Hannah."

Hannah lifted her head, eyes straining through the drizzle.

Claude stood a few steps away, a jet-black umbrella shielding him,his stance effortlessly refined. A dark gray Bentley purred at the edge of the sidewalk, its passenger door swung wide.

"Claude?" Hannah raised an eyebrow.

"Why didn't you answer my text?" Claude closed the distance,smoothly offering shelter beneath the umbrella.

"Apologies. Something came up." Her thoughts circled back to how her earlier conversation with Vincent had knocked it from her mind.

"You forgot, huh?" Claude replied,his tone edged with teasing."I booked that restaurant you enjoy. Care to join me?"

"I'm completely spent. Maybe a rain check?" Hannah instinctively retreated a step, keeping a sliver of distance.

Claude's grin didn't flicker. He moved with her, realigning to keep her under the umbrella.
"The table's already been booked. I ordered your usual-white truffle chicken pasta. Come with me, and afterward, I've got a place to show you." His voice carried a low insistence, difficult to dismiss.

He reached out, placing a courteous but assertive hand against the outside of her elbow.

Inside Hannah's chest, that old discomfort flared. Claude hadn't changed. Still unyielding, just as he'd been during childhood. Her brows drew together, her tone laced with weariness and a spark of annoyance. "Let's dine together another day."

"The drizzle's worsening. Let's get going," Claude urged,undeterred. His grasp on her elbow firmed slightly as he nudged her toward the vehicle.

Right then, Vincent's Cullinan eased from its parking space. The rear pane slid down partially.

Vincent, only half paying attention as Miles rambled beside him,glanced over toward the building's front. His gaze sharpened,his jaw set.

From Vincent's view, Claude was far too near, essentially wrapping Hannah beneath the umbrella, his arm nearly encircling her. His palm hovered at her elbow's edge.

And every signal from Hannah's body spelled unease. Her brow was knit, her posture stiff. She tried to edge away, but Claude's hold prevented her retreat.

Vincent's face clouded over. Hannah wasn't okay with this.Claude was pressing the boundary. Despite what Hannah might've claimed about Claude being harmless, this felt invasive.

Miles noticed the interaction but dismissed it as old familiarity,seeing no cause for alarm.
Vincent's expression turned thunderous. "Pull over," he snapped at the driver.

Before the vehicle even came to a halt, Vincent leapt out, rain soaking his blazer as he strode toward Hannah with controlled fury.

Meanwhile,still keeping his persuasive rhythm, Claude said,"I'm not merely your childhood pal. I'm your business partner. You're not gonna leave me hanging,are you?"

Hannah exhaled, defeated. "Fine. I'll come." She figured there was no point dragging this out.

As she stepped closer to his Bentley, an icy presence surged forward.

"Get your hands off her!" Vincent's words slashed through the rainfall,low and absolute.

Both Hannah and Claude turned in surprise. Without acknowledging Claude, Vincent swatted his hand off Hannah's arm with unmistakable force.

In that instant, Hannah was enveloped in Vincent's energy, his protective demeanor dominating the space.

Inwardly, Hannah wondered if Vincent thought she was being cornered.

Claude's fingers hovered in the air, Hannah's touch still ghosting on his skin. He raised his gaze, locking eyes with Vincent in a deliberate stare.

Instead of backing down, Claude's mouth curved with faint intrigue. So, this was Vincent. The one who'd once had Hannah and then lost her. The real power behind the Jones Group.Worse, Vincent had consistently outplayed him in business deals. At last, their paths crossed.

"Well, well, Mr. Jones," Claude muttered, voice smooth but
"Well, well, Mr. Jones," Claude muttered, voice smooth but edged. "I've heard plenty. Gotta admit, you do live up to the talk. It's a pleasure. Though..."

He trailed off, eyeing Vincent's arm protectively stationed in front of Hannah. "What's with this protectiveness? I'm offering her dinner. No reason to bare your fangs. Anyone might think l stole your wife. Oh, wait. Ex-wife."

He dragged the last phrase out, each syllable like a dagger.
###Chapter 247 It's Not Coercion

A chill seemed to radiate from Vincent, his entire expression rigid and cold as steel. He dismissed Claude's provocation entirely, his cold gaze boring straight into Claude's eyes.

"Nervous? Hardly," Vincent replied, voice steady and deep-though it rumbled with underlying menace. "What I saw was someone who refuses to accept 'no,' keeps crossing boundaries, and doesn't care when they're not welcome."

The implication in his words needed no explanation.

Claude scoffed, as if Vincent's accusation were a joke. His grin grew, but his gaze sharpened into something frostier. "All that over a simple dinner invitation, Mr. Jones? Don't you think you're overreacting?"

A dark storm brewed in Vincent's eyes, anger almost breaking through his calm exterior. "There's a difference between being persistent and ignoring someone's discomfort. When you won't stop after they say no, that's not determination. That's crossing the line! That's coercion!"

Vincent had seen the way Hannah recoiled-the way her body language screamed refusal. There was no mistaking it.

Claude's smile slipped away, replaced by an icy, stony glare.

All the while, Hannah stayed behind Vincent, startled by how much he'd noticed. Had he really caught everything? And how could he read her signals so clearly, when others always missed them? A mix of surprise and something softer stirred in her chest.

Claude's voice sliced through the tension, sharp and cold as
Claude's voice sliced through the tension, sharp and cold as glass. "Coercion, you said? Impressive, Mr. Jones. You sure know how to throw around accusations."

Drawing in a slow breath, Hannah finally stepped out from behind Vincent's shield. She faced him, her features still tired but her eyes resolute. "Thank you, Mr. Jones."

She sent Claude a pointed look, noticing how his expression had turned to stone, and then turned back to Vincent. There was exhaustion in her voice, but also a calm honesty."I know what you think you saw, and I get why you'd see it as coercion."

Vincent's jaw tightened, his frustration evident as he asked,"Wasn't it?"

"He didn't," she answered, her tone steady and sure. "Claude isn't the sort of man who would force me physically or drag me somewhere against my will. He never crossed that line."

She searched for the right words. "He can be... relentless.Sometimes, he gets so caught up in what he thinks is best for me that he stops listening. Yes, he grabbed my arm, and yes,his voice got harsh, but it wasn't coercion. I'd already agreed to dinner."

"You agreed to it?" Vincent's frown deepened, his disbelief showing in every word. He couldn't help raising his voice. "I saw you trying to pull away. Your expression said you wanted nothing to do with him. He was practically dragging you toward the car, and you're telling me that wasn't coercion?"

His questions tumbled out, raw with concern, as if he needed her to confirm the truth he believed he'd seen.

Hannah's patience wore thin under the barrage. With a weary sigh, she spoke frankly. "Yes, I did try to pull my arm away-that part is true. I just wanted to go home and rest, but Claude was insistent. Dinner was his idea, and he wouldn't let it go."

Af+er=briefnause she added. "He wasn't trving to hurt
Afterr a briof pause, she added, "He wasn't trying to hurt me.There was no coercion, no real pressure. This is just how he is -bullheaded, convinced he knows what's best for everyone."

The momnent her words fell, Claude's jaw unclenched, and a strange, almost triumphant satisfaction flickered across his features. She understood him completely, right to his core.

In his warped view of the world, Hannah hadn't changed since childhood. The loyal girl who'd always have his back, no matter what he did. His gaze was fixed on her, smugness practically radiating from him.

At Hannah's calm explanation, Vincent's stiff posture faltered,only slightly, but enough to notice. Showing care in that way?That was what she called it? So all that pressure from Claude,all the pushing and refusal to listen-she simply chalked it up to concern? And by the sound of it, she not only understood it,but she seemed to accept it.

Vincent's eyes darted from Hannah's steady expression to the triumphant glint in Claude's.

A knot of fustration tightened in Vincent's chest, fierce and burning. "You know him that well?" His voice came out rough and sharp. "You're really that used to his so-called 'care'?"

Hannah froze for a moment. After everything she'd just explained, and still, he didn't understand? Swallowing down a tangle of emotions, she replied softly, "Think whatever you want." She turned her attention to Claude. "Let's just go.Dinner's waiting."

She figured there was no point dragging this scene out any further.

She'd barely taken a step toward the car when Vincent's voice rang out behind her. "Wait!"
###Chapter 248 There Will Never Be Another Chanc...

Vincent's hand shot out on reflex, hovering in the space where Hannah's arm had been. He caught himself, leaving his gesture unfinished as Hannah, unbothered, glided into the Bentley's back seat without the faintest hesitation.

Claude slid in after her, his expression tinged with barely disguised victory.

With a low purr, the car eased into the rain-slicked street.taillights fading into the downpour.

Vincent stood unmoving in the storm, rainwater streaming down his temples, plastering his hair to his forehead and leaving cold tracks on his skin.

A Rolls-Royca Cullinan coasted to the curb, engine humming quietly.

The passenger door swung open, and Milos gostured Vincent in.Vincent ducked inside, settling into tho loathor soat as Miles glanced over with a knowing grin

"Seems you've found yourself a fierco rival. Mr. Jones," Miles remarked, voice casual but his ayas sharp with implication.

Vincant stayed oilont for a moment, his oyos tracking the city lights flickering boyond the glass Undor his breath, he muttered,′′Arival, huh?"

The word tolt torolan on Vincent's tongue. In the businos5world, Claudo wao navor worth a socond thought.

But with Hannah, Vincont found himsolt oft-balanco-unsottlod in a way that rattlad him. He doopised the toolina. It was timo

in a way that rattled him. He despised the feeling. It was time to move things forward.



Within the private dining space of a fancy restaurant, Hannah's white truffle chicken pasta sat mostly untouched.

"Not to your liking?" Claude's gaze lingered on Hannah from across the candlelit table, his eyes bright with mischief."That white truffle chicken pasta," he noted, a hint of nostalgia threading his words. "When we were kids, you loved eating every last bite without fail."

He paused just long enough for tension to flicker in the silence.His tone turned light, but the question beneath was pointed."Or is it Vincent still haunting your thoughts?"

Hannah's fingers faltered for a heartbeat before she steadied herself, fatigue flickering in her eyes despite her calm facade."It's not about him," she replied softly, her voice edged with weariness. "I'm just tired, that's all."

Claude carved a neat slice of venison and then set it delicately onto her plate. "Try this. Snow deer-flown in fresh. Supposed to melt the second it touches your tongue."

He slid her wine glass closer with a deft nudge, his movements smooth and almost intimate. "Pairs better with the Burgundy than you'd think."

With a practiced composure, Hannah lifted the meat and tasted it,moving with elegant restraint.

Setting aside his silverware, Claude swirled his wine, his eyes never leaving her face. "I hear Vincent's Project Echelon just scored a huge deal with one of the global telecom giants. His edge stays sharp as ever-ruthless and spot-on. Not many in the industry can still go toe-to-toe with him."

He took a leisurely sip, quietly watching for any ripple in her
He took a leisurely sip, quietly watching for any ripple in her expression.

Hannah's lips twitched, though there wasn't quite a smile. Odd,how Vincent and Claude seemed preoccupied with each other when speaking to her.

She finally met Claude's eyes, her own gaze cool and unwavering. "Vincent's always had sharp instincts-he knows how to work a project from every angle. Project Echelon's risky,sure, but they planned every move. You can tell his team did the research."

Her words were measured, impersonal-one professional sizing up another, no more.

Claude leaned in, curiosity flickering beneath the casual tone."How did you two end up together?" You and Vincent never seemed like you belonged in the same story." His question landed softly, but the intent was clear.

Hannah rested her fork on the linen, her posture composed as she leveled her gaze at him. Not a flicker of emotion crossed her face. "I was just too young back then. Too impulsive. I got married because I wanted to-no plan, no second thoughts."

She could hardly believe it now-how carelessly she'd rushed into marriage.

The memory hovered in the air, her voice even and remote, as if she were describing a stranger's life instead of her own.

Across the table, Claude slipped his phone from his pocket and began scrolling, feigning disinterest as his thumbs danced over the screen.

Meanwhile, on the top floor of the city's flashiest auction house, Vincent was deep in conversation with several heavyweight investors. Miles hovered nearby, orchestrating introductions with a practiced ease.
Just then, Vincent's private line buzzed in his pocket. He reached for his phone and caught sight of Claude's name on the display-a contact he'd saved years ago, mostly to get Claude off his back.

Vincent lifted a hand to quietly halt the discussion, then slipped away and answered the call.

Back at the restaurant, Claude's lips curled in a sly smile.Without missing a beat, he set his phone-screen down-on the table, somewhere near Hannah. The movement was relaxed,almost careless, as if he were just clearing space for dessert.

He leaned in, his voice gentle but probing, as if testing the water. "So, you've really let go of Vincent? There's no way back-is that it?"

Hannah didn't waver. Her reply was crisp, her tone cool and composed. "Letting go? I don't think that's the right word. You have to be holding something to let it go."

Her head tipped, a hint of wry amusement in her smile. "There was nothing between us. It's just business now. We're on separate paths."

After a brief pause, she met Claude's gaze head-on. "There'll never be another chance between him and me."

The finality in her words echoed through the line, heavy and absolute.

Across the city, standing before a wall of glass and the city lights,Vincent caught every syllable-each word slicing through the silence, impossible to ignore.
###Chapter 249 Never A Good Husband


"Letting go? Letting go? I don't think that's the right word. You have to be holding something to let it go There was nothing between us. It's just business now. We're on separate paths.There'll never be another chance between him and me."

Hannah's words rang out crisp and clear, each word striking Vincent like a sudden clap of thunder that refused to fade from his thoughts.

He squeezed his phone so tightly that his knuckles blanched,his face drained of all color.

A split second later, the glass in his other hand snapped with a piercing crack. Slivers of glass pressed into his skin, but he hardly noticed the pain. So, to Hannah, whatever they'd had was a ghost. Nothing left to hold, no reason to hope.

Meanwhile, at the restaurant, Claude's grin grew. "They say Vincent could freeze you out of a room. Must have been a hell living with someone so icy, right?"

Hannah raised her glass, a small, knowing smile on her lips."Cold? He's an unmatched businessman-but never a good husband. At least, not the sort I ever needed."

Claude slid another dish across the table, his voice warm. "Try a little more of this."

They lingered over the meal, sharing a peaceful quiet that needed no words.

As dinner drew to a close, Claude volunteered to take care of the bill and suggested Hannah wait for him in the lobby. She agreed with a polite nod and made her way out ahead of him.
But the truth was-Claude had already settled the bill ages ago.The only unresolved matter left on his mind was with Vincent.He could practically see the look on Vincent's face-pain etched deep, his pride in ruins.

That image alone sent a slow, wicked satisfaction swirling through Claude.

Claude reached for the phone lying face-down on the table.The call hadn't been disconnected.

Bringing it to his ear, Claude spoke, his voice soft and deliberate, every word sharpened to wound. "Did you catch that, Mr. Jones? Hannah said it herself..." His voice oozed with deliberate emphasis, every word honed to a razor's edge."There will never be another chance between you two."

Before Vincent could even utter a word, Claude ended the call.He slid his phone away, composed himself, and strode out the door with a quiet confidence.

Outside,he found Hannah waiting. She thanked him softly for the meal and gently hinted she was ready to head home.

Claude gave her a simple nod and, with a practiced gesture,led her toward the far end of the building-straight to the private elevator reserved for the hotel's upper floors.

Hannah didn't fully grasp what was happening until they reached the elevator. Claude had gently, but decisively,steered her there. She'd simply fallen in step beside him.

The elevator doors glided open with barely a sound.

She hesitated, brows knitting. "Claude? This isn't the way to the parking garage."

He reached out, his grip courteous yet unyielding. "There's something I want to show you."

She wasn't given a moment to protest. Suddenly, it struck
mn She wasn't given a moment to protest. Suddenly, it struck her: Claude hadn't just remained persistent despite the passage of the years-he'd grown bolder, more assertive, less inclined to take no for an answer.

The elevator climbed at a brisk pace. Moments later, Claude was ushering her into a suite, where a stylist slipped her into a buttery-yellow velvet dress that hugged her perfectly, the fabric hugging softly along her collarbones and shoulders.

Hannah stared at her reflection, confused. "What's going on?Where are we headed?"

Claude's lips curled into a secretive smile. "Patience. You'll find out soon enough."

A few minutes later, they stepped onto the top floor. Only then did the realization hit Hannah that Claude had brought her straight to the auction.

Stepping into the preview hall, Hannah's eyes widened at the spectacle, and Claude caught the flicker of surprise. Leaning in,he murmured, "So? What do you think? Intriguing, isn't it?"

She managed a quiet nod. "It's definitely one of a kind."

A hint of satisfaction played in Claude's voice. "I knew you'd like it."

But Hannah was already drawn to the sparkling jewelry displays,her curiosity leading her away.

As soon as the preview wrapped up, guests began making their way into the grand auction hall.

The auctioneer was moments from declaring a winning bid on a stunning pair of violet gemstone pendants when-

"Three-point-five million." The words rang out, low and unmistakable, from the very back of the room.
Everyone's attention shifted instantly. There sat Miles, one arm draped carelessly over his chair, a sly, knowing smile just barely touching his lips.

Next to him was Vincent, sharp in his signature black suit, his face a mask of calm detachment.

From their vantage point, every lot and every reaction in the hall was under their quiet scrutiny.

Hannah's breath caught the moment she spotted Miles and Vincent. Surprise flickered in her eyes, though deep down she'd expected they would come.

From the second Hannah entered, Vincent hadn't looked anywhere but at her. And she was standing side by side with Claude, perhaps a bit too near for comfort. He lifted a glass to his lips, every movement stiff and deliberate, his gaze never leaving her.

That was when Hannah noticed Vincent's right hand-bandaged,white gauze stark against the black sleeve. Her brows knit together in concern. What happened to his hand?
###Chapter 250 The Shawl

Miles slid a glance at Vincent, who sat beside him, silent and stoic as ever.

Miles and Vincent had made plans to come to the auction together right after their meeting, and for Miles, there was only one goal: the violet gemstone pendants. He was determined to win them for his mother's upcoming birthday.

Miles's gaze drifted for a moment to Vincent's hand, still wrapped in fresh bandages. The memory of what had happened barely an hour ago flickered through his mind: Vincent answering a call, his face darkening as he listened,then-without warning-crushing a wine glass in his fist.Burgundy wine had spilled in streaks across the carpet,mingling with blood, shards of glass wedged deep into Vincent's palm.

Even for Miles, who'd seen his share of chaos, the suddenness of it had rattled him.

"Three-point-five million dollars, going once...Any higher bids?"The auctioneer's clear voice cut through Miles's thoughts. He forced himself back to the present just as the gavel came down with a decisive crack.

"It's yours-congratulations!"

A faint, satisfied smile flickered on Miles's face as he acknowledged the result and signed off on the auction house's tablet, the gesture smooth and unhurried.

During the intermission, Vincent's attention drifted across the bustling venue. His gaze stopped cold when he caught sight of a familiar figure in the rear rows.

Hannah sat near the aisle, her arms loosely folded, slender fingers unconsciously tracing idle circles over her bare skin
There was a slight pinch between her brows-a nearly invisible shiver that didn't escape Vincent's notice

Next to her. Claude was turned away, engaged in animated conversation with a nearby guest, oblivious to Hannah's discomfort.

Vincent's jaw tightened Without breaking his composure, he made a subtle gesture to the attendant standing quietly at his side.

Top-tier patrons were each assigned dedicated attendants

Vincent, voice pitched low. issued a quiet command. "A blue shawl's in my car. Go get it for the woman over there-right away."

The attendant gave a nearly invisible nod and slipped away.In no time, he came back, holding a deep blue velvet box-elegant and unmarked. He moved up the aisle without a sound.pausing at Hannah's seat. With practiced care, he set the box on the armrest beside her, then leaned in and murmured softly."Ma'am, Mr. Jones noticed the AC might be chilly. He hopes this will help you stay comfortable."

Without waiting for a response, he withdrew-his presence vanishing as quickly as it had appeared.

Hannah blinked, caught off guard. She lifted the lid. Nestled inside was a midnight-blue cashmere shawl, impossibly soft, the very picture of understated luxury.

Claude turned just in time to catch the glint of deep blue velvet-and the instant he recognized the fabric, his easy smile faltered for a heartbeat. He reached over, deft and unhesitating,catching her wrist before she could lift the shawl.With gentle but unyielding authority, he swept it aside.

"Hold on," he murmured, the softness in his voice undercut by quiet command. "That shade's much too severe for this room
quiet command. "That shade's much too severe for this room It'll drown you out."

Before Hannah could answer, Claude was already sliding out of his tailored jacket, draping it across her shoulders with practiced care. "Here. This suits you far better."

Warmth settled over her shoulders. The luxurious shawl Vincent had sent over now lay forgotten, its velvet box closed with a quiet finality beneath Claude's hand.

Vincent watched it all unfold-expression unreadable,jaw tight -as Hannah rejected his gesture and instead wore Claude's jacket. It was a glaring sight.

"Ladies and gentlemen." The auctioneer's voice rang out, riding a fresh surge of anticipation through the room. "Now, let's move on to tonight's grand finale-The Tear of Andara."

A narrow spotlight swept over a rare, raw emerald resting atop black velvet. Inside its crystalline depths shimmered a pale,frozen lattice-an ice-like structure perfectly preserved by chance and time. Beyond its beauty, the emerald was rumored to conceal geological secrets-clues that could guide the Jones Group to an elusive mineral vein.

Claude sat forward in his seat, sharp eyes tracking every flicker of the bidding display. He raised his paddle repeatedly, each gesture crisp and impatient, hunger barely masked beneath a veneer of composure.

The room buzzed as bid lights flared in rapid succession, the price rocketing higher with each passing second.

Vincent, his face unreadable, betrayed nothing. His left hand hovered over the bidding tablet, fingers moving with mechanical precision. Every bid he placed landed like a silent gauntlet thrown-methodical,relentless, and utterly cold.

When the bid edged toward the unthinkable, the entire room fell into a hush. Breath caught in every throat. Only Claude's
fell into a hush. Breath caught in every throat. Only Claude's daring stare sliced through the tension.

Vincent didn't flinch. He pressed the button again, and the display blazed to life with a number so astronomical that even the seasoned auctioneer stumbled.

"We have ten million-front row. Mr. Jones." The auctioneer's voice trembled with awe, echoing through the spellbound hall.

The gavel fell, sealing the outcome.

Vincent stood, slow and unhurried, every movement rippling with unspoken authority as the room froze around him. A hundred eyes tracked him-some stunned, some awed-while he offered the auctioneer a faint, imperious nod. It was the kind of gesture that erased all doubt about who ruled the night.

He kept his injured hand concealed at his side, the pristine white bandage nearly invisible.

Whispers swept the crowd as the tension broke and people began to stir.

Claude slipped an arm over Hannah's shoulders, projecting easy confidence as he navigated through the crowd and toward Vincent and Miles, who were now hemmed in by a tight ring of high-rollers and society's elite.

"Congratulations, Mr. Jones." Claude's smile was cold perfection as he extended his hand, every inch the gracious rival."That kind of determination-you won't find it anywhere else in this room."

Vincent didn't acknowledge the handshake. His eyes swept right past Claude, landing unwaveringly on Hannah.

The tailored jacket wrapped around Hannah's shoulders burned in Vincent's sight, impossible to ignore.

"Excuse me." Vincent's voice slid through the tension, cold and
"Excuse me." Vincent's voice slid through the tension, cold and crisp, as he advanced without acknowledging Claude's presence.

Claude, sharp enough not to interfere, moved aside in silence.

Walking past where Hannah and Claude sat, Vincent's eyes caught a glimpse of something beneath the chairs. The shawl he'd sent-a midnight-blue swath of cashmere-lay tossed aside, carelessly forgotten, its elegance lost in a careless heap.Hannah hadn't bothered to take it with her. She'd left it behind like an afterthought.

For just an instant, Vincent's confident pace wavered, a crack in his relentless composure.
###Chapter 251 His Sudden Hug

In the auction house's delivery hall, Vincent was moments away from stepping into the private elevator when a familiar voice brought him to a sudden stop.

Across the polished floor, Claude led Hannah by the hand toward a glass display. "Come on. Let me show you what l snagged tonight."

Inside the case gleamed the treasures Claude had acquired-a diamond-and-enamel brooch and a rare art deco desk seal,both catching the light.

Claude turned to her, tone easy and inviting. "What do you think?"

Hannah's answer was coolly precise. "Investment-wise, the brooch's diamonds aren't particularly large, and the style is a bit too vintage for mass appeal. Still, its rarity makes it a real prize."

Her evaluation was quick, confident, a mark of someone who knew exactly what she was looking at.

Yet, even among all these finds, she found nothing came close to the emerald crystal Vincent had claimed earlier-The Tear of Andara.

Claude, catching sight of movement behind them, shifted closer to Hannah and dropped his voice into an easy warmth."I actually thought of gifting these to your parents. How does that sound?"

Hannah's immediate reaction was a shake of her head. "They're far too lavish."

"Too lavish?" Claude chuckled softly, lowering his voice to
"Too lavish?" Claude chuckled softly, lowering his voice to playful reproach. "What are you talking about? After all your parents did for me? Treating me like family when I had nowhere else to go? No present could possibly make up for that."

A beat passed. He studied her expression, letting a trace of vulnerability show. "Or... Could it be that I'm no longer considered part of the Scott family?"

Hannah caught the shadow of disappointment settling in his eyes. "Claude, you've got it wrong..."

Her gaze fell to the thoughtfully chosen gifts."It's just-"

"Just what, Hannah?" Claude pressed, gentle but insistent, his look searching. "All those years spent under the same roof mean nothing now?"

His voice was soft, but each word carried the gravity of something deeply personal.

After a quiet moment, Hannah relented. "Thank you," she murmured, sincerity woven through her tone. "No matter what,my parents will always see you as family. That's something no one can ever change."

A flicker of wild hope sparked in Claude's eyes-almost feverish in its intensity. But he wasn't satisfied. "And what about you, Hannah?" His next words trembled, barely masking the nerves beneath his calm exterior. "Who am I to you?"

Her thoughts wandered back in time-he'd once asked her that same question, long ago, when they were just kids growing up side by side. Time and distance hadn't erased that bond. Life had pulled them apart, but here they stood again. In her heart,he would always be family-a brother, steadfast and irreplaceable.

"You'll always be a brother to me," she replied, her voice calm and unwavering.
A wave of emotion broke over Claude, leaving him trembling.Without thinking, he drew her into a tight embrace. It was as if,for a heartbeat, he wished he could fuse her into his bones-never letting go.

"Hannah, not a day's gone by that I haven't thought of you,"he whispered, his voice thick with emotion. He'd dreamed of giving her "The Tear of Andara," a gift worthy of everything she meant to him. But Vincent had taken it with a single,crushing bid.

That didn't matter. Claude was determined-he would keep searching,keep offering her the world, one piece at a time.And when the storms came, he'd be the one standing in front of her. Just as she had stood between him and the world all those years ago.

Hannah stiffened for a moment in Claude's embrace,her body instinctively going rigid-but in the end, she let herself remain there. After a small pause, she tentatively lifted her hand and offered a gentle pat to his back, her words barely above a whisper, laced with warmth. "Welcome back."

A short distance away, Vincent saw the whole exchange. A sharp pang twisted inside his chest, cutting deep.

Claude noticed Vincent out of the corner of his eye, and a subtle, self-satisfied smile played at the edges of his lips. He gradually released his hold, yet kept one hand gently at the small of her back-as if keeping close to her came as naturally as breathing.

"Mr. Jones?" Claude called out with feigned surprise. "What are the odds?"

Vincent didn't acknowledge Claude, his gaze fixed on Hannah as he closed the gap between them. His eyes, intense and searching,never left hers. "Didn't you always say midnight blue was your favorite?"
A flicker of astonishment crossed Hannah's face. He remembered that?

Before she could respond, Vincent's tone hardened, brimming with pain he could no longer hide. "So why did you toss the shawl I gave you aside, like it was nothing?"

A faint blush crept up Hannah's neck. She had completely forgotten about it. She drew a breath to explain, but Claude was quicker, stepping in with his usual, courteous composure."Women always know which gifts are worth keeping and which ones to return. It's never without meaning-there are boundaries."

He let his words hang, subtle but pointed. "Isn't it a bit much to interfere with a woman's choices, Mr. Jones?"

"Shut your mouth!" Vincent's voice came out borittle and raw.The anger in his eyes burned, unmasked and fierce.
###Chapter 252 Her Full Attention On Another Man

Vincent's eyes bore into Hannah. "Hannah. I want to hear it from you."

He was desperate for her to speak, anything at all. Even a distant, cutting explanation would have been better than silence.

Hannah drew in a measured breath, fully aware of the weight of his stare-so intense that it threatened to swallow her whole.But Claude had a point. There should've always been boundaries between them.

Her gaze didn't waver as she answered Vincent, calm and direct, "It wasn't my intention to leave the shawl behind like that. I should've taken better care of it. But I didn't throw it away."

For a split second, something in Vincent's face relaxed. Deep down, he'd known she'd never be that heartless.

But her next words landed cool and precise, each one steady and impersonal.

"Claude was right. Considering where things stand between us,that kind of gift shouldn't have been exchanged."

Vincent's entire face went still, every muscle tensing as if turned to stone.

She continued, "That was a lapse in judgment on my part-l shouldn't have accepted it in the first place." Her gaze held Vincent's, calm and unyielding. "I'll have it cleaned and properly repackaged. It'll be returned-exactly as it was."
Standing beside Hannah, Claude wNore the look of a man who'd just claimed victory, his smile widening.

A hollow laugh escaped Vincent, all bitterness and no humor."That won't be necessary." Her words had just severed the last hope he'd managed to hold on to. His hand clenched at his side,trembling ever so slightly. "Just throw it out." Whatever softness had lingered in his eyes vanished. He looked away,gaze distant.

Hannah glimpsed something hidden beneath the surface-a flicker of emotion she couldn't quite figure out.

A heavy silence blanketed the space.

Breaking the tension, Claude rested a hand on her shoulder, his tone warm. "Hannah, could you pick up my items from the staff? They should be ready by now."

Still lost in thought, she answered with a quiet,"Of course."

Following the staff member away, Hannah didn't notice Claude's eyes trailing after her every step.

Vincent moved to leave, but Claude blocked his path without warning.

"Leaving already?" Claude's voice rang out tauntingly. "That hand of yours-looks like you're bleeding right through those bandages."

He leaned in close, dropping his voice to a venomous whisper."Hurts, doesn't it? Not so easy to ignore, is it?" Then, with a manic glint and a voice that carried, he added, "And still-she stood right there and didn't even spare a glance."

Claude's grin was all teeth. "She walked right past."

Vincent flinched, the pain raw and visible.

"Want to know what I did when I heard you two split?"
--
"Want to know what I did when I heard you two split?"Claude's eyes sparkled with unhinged delight. "I popped open the best bottle I had and celebrated her freedom until sunrise."He let the words build, each louder than the last. "Five months.That's all it took for me to be welcomed back into her life. And pretty soon, she'll belong to me."

That was the final straw. Vincent snapped. His fist lashed out,sending Claude crashing to the floor, streaks of blood from Vincent's hand wounds painting Claude's face.

Vincent didn't hesitate. He pulled Claude back up by the jacket,his voice a barely controlled snarl. "Don't you dare set your sights on her."

Catching sight of Hannah rushing over, Claude's lips twisted into a wicked smile. "How about we bet on it? Let's see who she really chooses."

He let his body slump back with a dramatic groan, making it look for all the world like Vincent had thrown him.

"Stop, Vincent!" Hannah's voice rang out as she rushed forward,shoving Vincent away from Claude. "What is wrong with you?"

She wasn't strong, but the force was enough to make Vincent stumble back. He locked eyes with her but didn't utter a word.

Hannah dropped to her knees beside Claude, urgency lacing her voice. "Claude! Talk to me. Are you alright?"

Claude slumped into her arms, feigning weakness, eyelids fluttering as he whispered, barely above a whisper, "I'm okay.Just a little lightheaded."

"Don't talk. I'm getting you to the hospital." Wasting no time,Hannah scrambled up, struggling to steady Claude as they half -staggered,half-limped away

Vincent watched in silence as she walked off, her full attention on another man. His own hand continued to bleed, but she
on another man. His own hand continued to bleed, but she hadn't spared it a single glance.

Meanwhile, Claude,eyes glazed,head drooping against Hannah,slowly twisted just enough to face Vincent. Through the blood smeared across his cheek, he flashed a triumphant, crooked smile. With blood at the edge of his mouth, he silently mouthed two unmistakable words: "I... Won."

Then, as if surrendering the last trace of awareness, Claude let his head drop onto Hannah's shoulder, slipping fully intothe part of the helpless victim.

Vincent caught every detail. Every syllable, every taunt. She had chosen-without hesitation-to shield another man.

A wave of fury crashed through Vincent. He drove his fist into the nearest glass display. A violent crash split the air as the glass burst into shards, scattering in every direction.

Blood continued to trickle down his knuckles, leaving crimson trails across his skin.
###Chapter 253 Caring So Much


Just now, Vincent had driven his fist straight into a mahogany display cabinet anchored to the wvall.

A thin stream of blood began to slide down his knuckles,leaving red drops on the marble beneath him. He barely reacted.

He kept his gaze fixed in the direction Claude and Hannah had disappeared, his tall figure seeming to give off a deep, empty grief.

All of the staff stood frozen, gripped by fear, none of them daring to step closer. Some hurried off to find the security manager and the supervisor.

Both the security manager and the supervisor rushed over, but as soon as they saw Vincent, their faces turned ashen and their breathing grew shallow.

An uneasy chill filled the entire room.

Only a few moments passed before Miles entered from the VIP lounge. Having just wrapped up a round of smooth talking with important clients, he walked in looking perfectly composed,still wearing a careful, distant expression.

Miles glanced down at Vincent's bloodied hand, his brow furrowing for just a split second. He chose not to ask questions.

The security manager started to mumble, "Mr. Whitaker, about Mr. Jones..."

Miles lifted his hand, silencing the manager with that simple gesture. Without even glancing Vincent's way, he spoke in a
gesture. Without even glancing Vincent's way, he spoke in a steady voice. "Send a detailed invoice to the Jones Group.Price the damages at the top market value."

The supervisor, taken aback by Miles's calm authority, nodded frantically. "Yes. We'll get right on it and send the letter to the Jones Group."

Miles whispered a few more instructions, and the security manager scurried off.

A doctor hurried in, took one look at Vincent's injury,and let out a quick gasp. Right away, he began cleaning and wrapping up the wound. When he was done, sweat beading on his forehead, he ventured, "Mr. Jones, you need to visit a hospital.That cut is much deeper than it looks."

Vincent lowered his eyes, staying completely silent.

Neither Vincent nor Miles said a word once they settled into the car.

After a while, Miles broke the silence. Their companies had a joint project on the table.

"The city's east side land deal is almost locked in with the government. The initial demolition hit some snags, but I talked to Robin Gill. He'll budge if we bump up the compensation by one percent," Miles said, scrolling through data on his tablet,his tone all business.

Vincent acknowledged with a deep sound, rough at the edges,as if his voice had just woken from sleep.

Miles swiped his finger across the screen, closing the file. With a shift in his tone that signaled genuine curiosity, he asked, "So,you and Hannah. What's the deal now?"

Not bothering to turn his head, Vincent kept staring out the window, a tightness building in his throat as he fought back a tidal wave of emotion.
Just when Miles figured Vincent would stay silent, Vincent muttered, barely audible, "No deal."

Miles replied in a gentle voice, "Is that so?" After a few seconds, his words took on a deeper, more serious note."Come on, man. You care about her so much. Even more than back when she lost her sight."

Vincent let his eyelids fall shut for a moment and then opened them, his features settling into a calm, blank stare as he tried to shake off what Miles had just said. Changing the topic back to business, he spoke. "About the land on the east side. Robin's got big plans lined up."



Since the auction, Vincent had been grinding through a brutal week, running on fumes like an overclocked machine. He hadn't come home once.

Having skipped the hospital trip altogether and only received basic treatment, the injury on his hand kept flaring up, never healing,while a pale flush colored his face with fever.

One day, Derek entered Vincent's office quietly, placing the finalized East District proposal on the cleanest spot he could find on Vincent's cluttered desk. "Mr. Jones, I've got the last draft for the project."

Vincent didn't lift his head, only offering a gruff hmm.

Derek lingered. Vincent had been swamped, barely touching the ground, so Derek saw his chance to bring up Erica's situation. "Mr. Jones, I have something to report."

But before Derek could continue, a sharp bang echoed through the room. Vincent collapsed into his leather chair and lost consciousness.

Derek hurried to Vincent's side, instantly noticing how hot
Derek hurried to Vincent's side, instantly noticing how hot Vincent felt with a fever. Without wasting a second,he called for assistance, and together they rushed Vincent to the hospital.

After fluids and a routine of hospital procedures, Vincent finally regained consciousness. The harsh scent of antiseptic made him wince.

Derek spoke. "Mr. Jones, your fever was through the roof. The doctor says you can't keep working yourself like this."

"Get out," Vincent rasped, his throat scratchy and congested.

Holding back anything else he wanted to say, Derek left the room, deciding to fetch something Vincent could eat.

Vincent pushed himself upright, his head spinning as a thick fog clouded his thoughts.

A few moments passed before he pulled the IV from his arm.Paperwork and contracts still waited for him back at the office.

Clouded by fever and stubborn determination, Vincent drove himself straight back to work.

When Derek returned with a tray of food, he stopped short,finding the hospital bed empty.

"Back to the office? Vincent just won't quit," Derek muttered to himself.




Hannah had clocked out and returned to her apartment building.She stepped out of the elevator, only to stop in her tracks.Someone tall, unmistakable even from a distance, stood at her apartment door.
She recognized Vincent immediately. posture stiff and formal.
###Chapter 254 Did He Really Come Here For Her


As Hannah walked closer, confusion showed on her face "Vincent? Are you trying to find Miles's apartment? He lives upstairs, not on this floor."

That was when Hannah spotted an odd redness coloring Vincent's face. Before she could ask what was wrong,his next move caught her completely off guard.

Gradually, his blurry eyes found focus. Without warning, he rested his head against her shoulder, moving as if in slow motion.A faint,heat-soaked groan slipped from his mouth.

His forehead,blazing with fever, pressed into the soft spot at her neck, and the sudden warmth caught her off guard. Each breath he took sounded rough and uneven, every exhale scorching against her skin.

Then, a raw, almnost sleepy whisper slipped out. "I've... been waiting for you... for so long."

The words were slurred but unmistakably clear. Hannah's eyes went wide in surprise. Did he really come here for her?

Their closeness felt overwhelming. Part of her wanted to put space between them right away. Still, his burning skin made her hesitate.

She steadied him and dragged his heavy frame toward the couch inside her apartment.

With her heart pounding and sweat beginning to bead on her forehead, she grabbed her phone to call Derek.

Her fingers had barely started to punch in the number before
Her fingers had barely started to punch in the number before a scorching hand wrapped weakly around her wrist. His grip had no strength, only the desperation of a man burning with fever.

Turning toward him, she caught his half-closed eyes staring at her.

"Stay here..." he remarked, his voice thin and almost lost.

Something strange and sharp cut through her chest. The heat from his hand seemed to rush straight into her blood. She tried to pull away, keeping her voice soft. "I need to call Derek. You need to be taken to a hospital-you're burning with fever."

"Don't... go." Right now, he was nothing like the powerful,distant CEO she remembered. Instead, he looked unguarded and vulnerable. distant CEO she remembered. Instead, he looked unguarded and vulnerable.

Drawing in a steady breath, she glanced at the deep flush spreading across his cheeks and the disoriented glaze in his eyes.

Eventually, she let out a soft sigh. Gently freeing her wrist from his hold, she went to get some fever medicine and filled a glass with water.

Taking a seat at the very edge of the couch, she leaned closer.One hand cradled the back of his neck, while her other hand pressed the pill carefully to his mouth. "You need to take this.Open your mouth," she instructed.

Obedience came unexpectedly from him. He swallowed the medicine quietly, almost as if he were in a trance.

Her gaze dropped to his right hand. When dragging him inside earlier, she thought she'd brushed against his wound. Fever and hand injury? What had he been through?

Gently, she touched the edge of the gauze wrapped around his hand and asked in a hushed voice, "How did you get hurt?"
She hadn't expected a response. But then-hoarse,slurred-came a barely audible murmur. No real words, just a raw,unfocused mumble.

A puzzled look crossed her face, uncertain of his meaning.

Even so, she quietly redressed his hand, making sure the bandage was neat and secure.

Maybe the medicine had begun to work, because Vincent's body slowly relaxed and his breathing settled into a calm,steady rhythm as he drifted off to sleep.

Not until then did Hannah stand up, moving toward the nearby window. She pulled out her phone and dialed Derek. "Vincent is at my place right now. You need to come pick him up," she said,getting straight to the point as soon as the call connected.

A pause hung between them before Derek's sigh came through,heavy with relief. "That's a relief. I'm glad to hear it. How is Mr.Jones doing now?"

"I gave him medicine for the fever. He's sleeping now," she replied, her eyes wandering back to Vincent as he lay quietly on the couch.

"That's unusual. He hasn't had proper sleep in days. The thing is..." Derek's voice changed a bit, a trace of hesitation slipping in. "Something urgent just came up here. I can't get away tonight. I'll come over first thing in the morning. Would you be alright with letting him stay overnight?"

He picked up on her hesitation, so he spoke again, a little more quickly. "It's probably safer not to move him much right now.He needs a real rest."

Derek's thoughts spun in every direction. He knew full well that if he went to get Vincent right now, Vincent would just hole up in his office, running himself into the ground with work even while sick.
"Fine," Hannah replied. She figured it wasn't a big deal. Claude had taken her parents out of town for a couple of days-there wouldn't be anyone else coming home tonight. Spending one night alone with Vincent seemed manageable.

By the time morning light crept in, Vincent slowly stirred awake.

Sitting upright, he let the blanket slip from his shoulders, and right away, he noticed his right hand had been wrapped.in a fresh bandage. The wrapping was different from the medical staff's usual way. A bit clumsy, maybe, but it showed a gentle touch.

"Not a fan of the wrapping?" Hannah's voice floated in from the kitchen, having caught his uncertain expression. "If it bothers you, I can take it off. Want to redo it yourself?"

His reply came almost at once. "No." The answer slipped out before he could think, her voice pulling something inside him to the surface. He gave a small shake of his head.

A crease formed between his brows as bits and pieces of last night came back to him. He remembered yanking out the IVin the hospital and making his way to the car. The plan was to return to the office. But then-

His chain of thought broke as footsteps approached.

Hannah walked over, carrying two bowls of porridge, her hair pinned up loosely, dressed in a plain set of loungewear.

Their eyes locked for a moment.

Dragging himself toward the table, Vincent asked, "How did get here?" His voice was rough from sleep. Faint memories flickered-he remembered clinging to her last night and begging her not to leave.
###Chapter 255 What Did You Think I Was Going To Do

Seated across from Vincent, Hannah didn't glance at him.Resignation slid into her tone. "I wish I knew the answer, Mr.Jones.Why,with a fever of 104 degrees Fahrenheit, would you ignore the hospital's top-tier room, pull out the IV, and drive over..." She lifted her gaze to his face, gaze unwavering. "To my doorstep and faint?"

Vincent felt color rush up the side of his neck, his ears prickling hot. Flashes of the previous night-the confusion, the ache-pulsed behind his eyes. Avoiding her stare, he managed,"Guess I took a wrong turn."

A flicker of something crossed Hannah's face, but she didn't press further.

Vincent soon disappeared into the bathroom to take a quick shower and freshen up, the sound of running water filling the silence.

Roughly twenty minutes later, he emerged, looking noticeably more awake. He rejoined her at the table, the scent of the porridge still lingering.

"Want some?" She nudged a bowl of porridge his way, her voice gentler now.

Vincent picked up the spoon and consumed the porridge in silence. "So, your parents," he started, voice barely above a murmur. "They're not home?"

Hannah met his eyes, her answer light and unconcerned."They're off traveling."

He dipped his head again, falling quiet as he focused on his
He dipped his head again, falling quiet as he focused on his food.

A few minutes later, Hannah set her spoon aside with a gentle clink.

He watched, gaze drawn to her as she stood. She moved around the table, and before he could react,she leaned in-so close that her scent, soft and sweet, curled around him.

Vincent froze, muscles taut as a drawn wire. He could make out the tiny flutter of her lashes, trembling ever so slightly.Why...why was she suddenly this close to him?

His pulse thrashed in his chest, wild and uneven. His grip on the spoon tightened until his knuckles shone bone-white. He swallowed hard, Adam's apple jerking, a flash of surprise and nervousness flickering across his face-so fleeting that he barely registered it himself. "What on earth are you..."

Before he could finish, Hannah reached out, placing her hand on his forehead.

He blinked. So, she was just checking his temperature. That was all.

As quickly as she'd closed the distance, she drew her hand back, catching the way his breath hitched and his posture went stiff.

She stepped back, standing straight, her clear eyes meeting his still somewhat dazed gaze. A gentle, teasing smile tugged at her lips. She tipped her head, voice lightly edged with mischief."What did you think I was going to do?"

Her words, tossed out so breezily, sent a cascade of embarrassment through Vincent-like stones dropped into still water, each word rippling outward. He jerked his face aside,heat flooding his ears, the faint blush crawling up his neck as if he'd been branded by the brief, lingering touch of her fingers.His throat constricted, choking off any words before they could
His throat constricted, choking off any words before they could leave his lips.

Hannah's playful spark faded, giving way to a tangled ache. She caught the moment he stiffened, his bewilderment radiating like static in the air, and it only deepened her own uncertainty.

She gathered herself and took a step back, coldly reestablishing the gap between them. Her voice returned to its previous calm, even carrying a hint of deliberate detachment,as if the earlier teasing was an illusion. "Your fever's gone." She paused for a moment before adding, "I'll have Derek swing by to pick you up."

Before Vincent could muster a reply, she turned away, phone in hand. Her movements were brisk and unhesitating-unlocking,scrolling,finding the right number, and making the call, all in a practiced rhythm.

Once she'd hung up, a hush drifted over the living room.

Hannah didn't return to the table but poured him a glass of water.

The silence pressed down, thick and unyielding, until Hannah finally cut through it, nudging the glass of water toward him."Here, have some water." Her voice remained even, without fluctuation. "Derek should be here soon."

Vincent's eyes flicked up from the rim of his glass, settling on her face as if searching for some trace of warmth. He parted his lips, voice rough as gravel. "You..." But the rest caught in his throat,lost.

She avoided his gaze. Her words came out crisp and distant."You should let a doctor take a look at your hand when you get back. Keep it dry and don't let it get infected."

Her advice landed with the brisk efficiency of a stranger,not someone who'd just watched over him all night.
"Thank you." The syllables felt stiff on his tonguJe,husky but unmistakably sincere.

Suddenly, the sharp chime of the doorbell sliced through the hush, jolting Hannah out of her thoughts. She stiffened,assuming Derek had finaly shown up

She inhaled deeply, steadying her expression before reaching for the knob.

From the other side, Margaret's voice called out, light but puzzled. "That's strange. The door's locked. Anna should be inside... Anna, open up! Claude's with me-we're back!"

Vincent, halfway to the entryway, froze in place. He straightened his clothes by reflex, running a hand through his hair.

Hannah's eyes narrowed, a jolt of panic darting across her face Weren't they supposed to be out of town? Why were they home so early?
###Chapter 256 Hiding Him In Her Room


In a flash, emotion overtook reason.

Hannah whirled with such speed that she barely managed to explain anything to Vincent. She glanced his way and then seized Vincent's uninjured hand in a swift, demanding yank.

Vincent lurched from the unexpected pull, wide-eyed. He glanced at their joined hands, startled."What's happening-"

"Quiet. Come." Hannah's words were hushed and shaky, loaded with haste. Her hold was alarmingly firm.

Before Vincent could ask anything, she was yanking him straight to her bedroom, almost toppling him.

A voice rang from outside the apartment-Margaret's, tinged with alarm and increasing volume."Hannah? What's happening in there? Open the door,
darling! Claude's with me!"

Hannah stiffened. Claude was with her mom? She faced Vincent and fired out a trio of orders, low and fast. "Hide. Stay inside. Keep silent."

With a muffled noise, the bedroom door shut behind her.

Vincent leaned against the cold frame, heart pounding-not from illness, but from the sheer madness of the scene. He'd just been tucked away like something scandalous. Because beyond the wall were her parents. And Claude.

Back in the living room, Hannah adjusted her rumpled top, tugging at the collar. She drew in a breath, setting her face before swinging the front door open. "Dad? Mom? What brings you back so early?" Her voice rose in artificial brightness, feigned surprise.

Raymond and Margaret entered, both grinning.Behind them stepped Claude, neat in a pale lounge suit, carrying a fruit basket with grace.
"We were having fun," Raymond began,”but youn mother caught a chill last night and had a bit of a headache. We thought we'd return earlier."

"You alright, Mom?" Hannah asked, tone soft with worry.

"It's nothing serious," Margaret replied with a wave-but her sharp gaze had aready started its sweep of the apartment. Her eyes locked on something. TwO used bowls on the dining table. And beside one of them-a man's watch. She froze.

Hannah traced the direction of Margaret's stare. Her gut twisted.

Margaret gestured toward the bowls and the unfamiliar timepiece, her brow tightening. "Hannah,do you have company?"

Meanwhile, in the bedroom, Vincent caught every word-clear and distinct. The watch was his. A Patek Philippe Celestial. He had removed it earlier and forgotten to retrieve it.
Thoughts collided in Hannah's head. Her lies came out brittle and uneven. "A friend wasn't feeling great and dropped by. We talked. It got late, so l offered some food. She-she left early this morning.Rushed out. Forgot to pick up the watch."

She avoided meeting Margaret's stare.

Claude's grin remained easy and warm-but the panic behind Hannah's eyes hadn't escaped him.There was a flicker of steel in his gaze, though the smile stayed in place. He chose not to expose her.Instead, with the smoothness of playing along, he chimed in, "Hannah, that friend of yours has expensive taste. Be sure she comes back forit."

Color rose to Hannah's cheeks. She gave a stiff nod."Yeah. I'll remind her." Desperate to move on, she turned to Margaret. "Mom, I'm heading in to change."

The door of her bedroom had barely clicked behind her when Vincent lunged forward without warning.Before she could react, his injured hand shot up,slamming against the wall just beside her ear.
In an instant, she was caged between the door and the searing heat of his chest.

A faint, derisive laugh escaped Vincent-quiet but sharp as a blade.

His tone was husky, thick with dark amusement. He tipped her chin up gently. "Hannah, the situation right now..." He let the words hang, his eyes locked on hers, and then added with biting calm, "Doesn't it feel like we're sneaking around?"

His words threw Hannah off guard. Flushed with a mix of embarrassment and anger, she tried to push him away-but he held her with unyielding strength."You're being absurd!" she snapped, panicked.

"AmI?" Vincent didn't budge. He leaned even closer,breath warm and steady. "What are you afraid of?"His voice dropped, but the words sliced clean."Terrified Claude might find out that you've stashed a man in your room?"

Her blood ran cold.
Vincent's emotions surged wildly, every word laced in poison. "He matters to you that much?"

His breath, still warm with fever, brushed her neck."You don't want him to see me here? Worried he'll be upset?"

Through the door came Margaret's voice in the living room-soft, curious. "Claude, just now, did you catch a noise in Hannah's room?"

Claude chuckled meaningfully, the corner of his lips rising. "Hmm... yes. Sounded like something strange."
###Chapter 257 An Accidental Kiss


Vincent's questions hung in the air, and Hannah turned her head away to avoid his eyes.

A heavy hush settled between them.

The stillness seemed to stretch forever, laden with sorrow.

No answer came from Hannah.

Vincent's gaze remained locked on her. Under his relentless questioning-after he'd laid everything bare-she chose silence. Her refusal to speak wounded him far more than any argument or denial ever could. To him, that silence was as good as confession.

He stopped pressing for answers. His hand,which had been locked under her chin, slowly released its grip. Even the tension in his other arm vanished as he dropped it from the door. No longer boxing her in, he
straightened, retreating without a word.

Instinctively, Hannah reached out, searching for something,anything to hold onto.

Suddenly, MAargaret called out from the hallway,worry coloring her tone, "Hannah? Are you in there with someone? Open the door and tuck away your friend's watch. It's expensive!"

The doorknob rattled as Margaret tried to force it open.

The lock held fast.

Vincent's gaze flickered to the lock, hoping the door would open and Hannah's family would find him inside her room.

Hannah wasn't too panicked as she had locked the door.

The door remained shut.

Hannah had been ready to brush her mother off when she caught sight of Vincent reaching for the
door handle. Absolutely not.

Alarm bells rang in Hannah's mind, every instinct screaming at her to act. Her parents could not find him here, no matter what. Reflex took over before her thoughts even had time to catch up.

In one swift move, she lunged at Vincent, desperate to block his path. Her whole weight pressed against him, and her knee found his abdomen in the chaos.At the same time, her palm slammed down on his bandaged right hand.

A strained groan tore from Vincent's throat as his body doubled up from the pain.

Their struggle sent them careening backward,neither able to stop their momentum.

With a bone-jarring thud, Vincent's back crashed against the wall.

A loud thud shook the air, and right behind it came a crisp clicking sound.

Vincent had collided with the wall, his weight
pressing against the light switch.

Instantly, the gentle glow from the wall sconces vanished. Pitch darkness swallowed the room. Every sound and touch became painfully vivid.

Just as Vincent tried to make another dash for the door, Hannah caught his injured hand, yanking him toward her.

Pain etched across his face, Vincent tried to wrench free,but she pulled him in closer.

Both tumbled onto the bed in a tangled heap.

Unexpectedly, Hannah's lips brushed right against his mouth, open from his pained gasp.

A jolt of electricity seemed to crackle between them.With the world reduced to black, every nerve in their bodies felt on fire.

For a split second, time stood perfectly still.

Every ounce of fight, anger, and pain in Vincent seemed to evaporate at the soft, unexpected warmth
that pressed against his lips. Loose strands of Hannah's hair drifted down, brushing teasingly against his heated skin. Shallow breaths escaped her, each one mingling with his.

Shock had rooted Hannah in place, leaving her mind a blank slate. Vincent's lips moved ever so slightly,the faint friction brushing against hers, causing Hannah's breath to catch momentarily.

Margaret's concern sharpened as she called out from the other side of the room, "Hannah? Why did you turn off the light? What's happening?" More urgent knocking rattled the door, her tone rising."Open up! Unlock the door!"

That interruption struck like lightning, snapping Hannah out of her daze. She scrambled to push Vincent away, her hands shaking. Inhaling slowly,she fought to steady her voice and disguise her nerves."It's nothing, Mom. I was just looking for something to wear, and everything tumbled out. I must have hit the wall and turned the lights off by accident."

One flick of the switch flooded the room with light,
causing both of them to blink in the sudden brightness.

The chaos seemed to settle. Vincent quieted down,his urge to leave gone.

Margaret continued, "Then let me in-I'll help you find it!"

Thinking quickly, Hannah fired back, "Mom, I'm still changing! With Claude waiting outside, shouldn't I at least look presentable? How could I face anyone like this?" She raised her voice deliberately, balancing shyness with a hint of youthful defiance toward her mother.

Margaret conceded, her voice softening, "Claude's practically family." With that, she finally moved away.

Meanwhile, Vincent's thoughts remained tangled around the kiss, his words coming out rough and unsteady. "Why?" He wondered why she kissed him.

On instinct, Hannah reached out to gently cover his mouth, whispering, "Quiet now."
###Chapter 258 Were They About To Get Engaged

Vincent's breath was warm against Hannah's palm, catching her off guard with its intimacy.

Hannah snapped her hand back, heart thudding. She turned away abruptly, avoiding his piercing, unreadable stare. Her tone softened, edged with embarrassment. "That wasn't intentional."

She rattled on, hoping to cut the tension, but her gaze darted to the blood welling on his hand. "We've kissed before.Why are you so rattled now?" she demanded, her voice tight."Shouldn't you be worrying about your injury instead?"

A flicker of surprise and frustration darted across Vincent's features, but before he could find his words, Hannah's fingers were already flying across her phone. She fired off a brisk message to Derek and then glanced up, catching the ashen look on Vincent's face. Without missing a beat, she said, "Listen.Right now. Take care of your hand. Don't let blood drip all over the place."

She jerked her chin toward the first-aid kit tucked in the corner, her voice leaving no room for argument.

"In a few minutes, I'll pull my parents and Claude into the study,"she continued, calm and precise. "Once they're in, I'll unlock the front door. The second you see your chance, get to the elevator and don't look back. Move swiftly-no hesitation."

She angled her phone, letting him glimpse the screen. "I've already texted Derek-he's downstairs in the parking garage,waiting for you."

Her voice was crisp, steady. Not a trace of the earlier panic lingered; she radiated calm control. Every detail of her plan
lingered; she radiated calm control. Every detail of her plan revolved around a single goal: removing this human catastrophe from her life as soon as possible.

Vincent studied her profile, struck by its icy resolve-as if the earlier kiss hadn't touched her at all.

The moment she stepped out of the room, he snatched up a roll of gauze and slapped it against his bleeding hand, the motion sharp with irritation.

From the living room drifted the sound of cheerful conversation-Margaret, Raymond, and Claude laughing together.

When Hannah walked back in, Claude sat up a little straighter,his face shifting to something earnest as he turned to Margaret and Raymond. "Actually, I've wanted to bring this up for a while ... Do you think I could cal you Mom and Dad again, like I did before? Calling you Mr. and Mrs. Scott just feels... wrong."

The last words tumbled out, tinged with embarrassment.

Raymond and Margaret exchanged a look, something thoughtful flickering between them. Raymond kept his tone steady. "It means a lot that you'd say that, but you don't have to. You have your own father."

Margaret, however, jumped in with a gentle laugh."Oh,what harm is there if it's just between us? Claude's always been such a considerate boy, bringing gifts like this-we shouldn't overlook that."

Claude brightened and jumped at the chance, grinning as he called out, "Mom."

Margaret's smile deepened, her eyes softening with affection.

Raymond didn't say another word.

Claude glanced over at Hannah and queried, "What about you,
Claude glanced over at Hannah and queried, "What about you,Hannah? Are you fine with it?"

She only half-registered the question, flashing a cordial smile."Sure,why not? We're family. It's nice to feel close like this."Without missing a beat, she shifted the focus. "By the way,Dad,Mom, Claude-didn't we have some old photos of the four of us in the study? Why don't we go check them out?"

Margaret and Raymond perked up, clearly delighted, while Claude's gentle smile remained steadfast.

They all voiced their agreement, and together they strolled down the hallway toward the study's closed door.

Trailing just a step behind Hannah's parents, Claude suddenly stopped in his tracks. He gazed intently at their backs and then raised his voice, calling out in a clear, confident tone,"Mom!Dad! Careful where you step, okay?"

His words landed with the casual warmth of someone long at home in this family, filling the still corridor with the comfortable timbre of belonging.

From the bedroom, Vincent caught every syllable,the sound slicing through the quiet like a crack of thunder. A chill swept through him, leaving him momentarily stunned and struggling for air. Claude, addressing Hannah's parents like family-was he courting her?

Vincent's mind raced. Claude had wedged himself right into the heart of the Scott family, assuming the effortless air of a future son-in-law. Worse, Hannah's parents seemed to have already opened their arms to Claude, as if welcoming a replacement into their circle. Were Claude and Hannah about to get engaged? And Hannah-she was allowing this, making no move to push Claude away? She'd allowed Claude to enter her home to make their relationship official?

In that instant, it all fell into place for Vincent. No wonder
In that instant, it all fell into place for Vincent. No wonder Hannah had hidden him from her parents and Claude. No wonder she'd dodged his questions. Silence, after all, was as good as admission.

A fierce surge of rage crackled through Vincent, threatening to blow his composure apart. The familiar sensation of unraveling from the inside out clawed at his chest-sharp, raw, like something splitting open beneath his ribs.

He couldn't bear to linger another second. He needed out.

His hand was just curling around the doorknob when Hannah opened the door. "Great timing. Just go."

Vincent ignored her completely, spine rigid as he moved past.

"Wait-your watch." She thrust the watch toward him as he hit the threshold.

Before he could respond, the door slammed behind him-clean,final, no hint of hesitation.

His footsteps echoed down the hallway, leaden and unsteady,until he emerged into the dim parking garage.

Derek had barely made it out of the car when a voice rang out from the elevator lobby, halting Vincent in his tracks.
###Chapter 259 Compassion Isn't The Same Thing As...

"Mr. Jones." A crisp, unruffled voice echoed across the empty parking garage.

Claude emerged from a sliver of darkness near the elevator,his footsteps deliberate, his silhouette slicing through the haze.He'd slipped away from Hannah's study moments ago, feigning a quick errand to justify his sudden absence upstairs. Just as he'd guessed, it was Vincent who had been hidden in Hannah's room.

The realization twisted Claude's features, a shadow passing over his eyes as everything clicked into place.

Vincent didn't bother to face Claude. He just drew himself up a little straighter, shoulders squared in silent defiance.

Claude stopped just out of arm's reach, his voice cool and almost bored. "If you're feelingill, you should be resting somewhere quietly. Disturbing others is not right."

He didn't say Hannah's name, deliberately reducing her to a faceless "other"-each word severing any remaining tie between Vincent and her.

Vincent pivoted to face Claude, eyes burning with challenge and the promise of a fight.

Claude didn't flinch. He looked back with effortless confidence,a hint of laziness in his posture but none in his authority.′′Anna has a soft spot for people. That's the only reason she let you stay-a moment of pity, nothing more."

His tone was smooth, but the edges were sharp and precise."She's always been sentimental, too quick to show mercy to
"She's always been sentimental, too quick to show mercy to anyone from her past." He took a step closer, dropping his voice. "But don't mistake her kindness for something deeper.Compassion isn't the same thing as care."

He let that hang in the air, his gaze unwavering. "So, Mr. Jones,I'd appreciate it if you didn't disrupt our lives again. That's what's expected of an ex-husband."

Vincent's gaze sharpened, cold and predatory, a steely glint surfacing in his eyes. His words came out rough but unwavering,each syllable laced with disdain. "So tell me, Claude Hobbes-who the hell do you think you are?"

A crooked, calculated smirk played at the corner of his mouth -not warmth, but the kind of arrogance bred from years of dominance. He refused to cede a single inch, his tone clipped and distant. "Save your little speeches for the day you actually become Hannah's spouse. Until then, don't presume so much."

With a brief pause, he added, "So until that day comes, you're not in a position to say anything."

His words were cutting, cold contempt threading every syllable.

Without another look at Claude, Vincent pivoted away,his jaw locked tight. He yanked open the car door with a brittle show of control, slid inside, and slammed it behind him.

The engine growled to life, and the sleek black sedan peeled away, vanishing around the bend without a single backward glance.

Claude remained rooted to the spot. His fingers curled involuntarily into fists, that polished charm dissolving in an instant-replaced by a fierce,tightly coiled anger.

...
In the top-floor CEO office, Derek stood stiffly in front of the vast executive desk, fingers tightening around the folder in his
vast executive desk, fingers tightening around the folder in his hands. He drew a shaky breath and started, voice hesitant."Mr.Jones, there's something I should report. You've had so much on your plate lately that I haven't found the right time to bring it up..."

A nervous pause lingered. "Some time ago, Ms. Stanton went into your study," he said, his words measured and wary.

Vincent's brow creased, annoyance flickering in his gaze. "Get to the point."

Derek's eyes fluttered shut for a split second, as if bracing himself, before he rushed out the truth. "She went in late at night, under the impression you were the one sleeping there."

His confession hung heavily in the room, silence stretching.

Vincent turned his head, movements slow and deliberate, his features carved from stone.

Derek hurried on, tension clear in his voice. "She's been showing up at the company, insisting on seeing you. I've been dodging her, telling her you're unavailable."

Vincent didn't bother to answer instantly. A moment later, his deep, flat voice sliced through the hush. "Revoke Erica's access. Effective immediately. She doesn't set foot in this building again."

His order left no room for argument.

Derek straightened, answering briskly, "Understood!"

Derek hesitated before adding, "Also, your grandmother's been trying to call. She says it's urgent."

Vincent exhaled. What else could her grandmother want, if not to bring up Erica again? He slumped deeper into his chair,exhaustion dulling his voice."Got it."
Derek slipped out, letting the heavy door sigh shut behind him.

The office fell into that uncanny quiet once more, oppressive and absolute.

Vincent's eyes drifted back to his desk. The tablet before him glowed cold and blue, bathing his face in icy light.

He wasn't scrolling through emails-Fontaine Galleria's dossier filled the screen, details glaring back at him.

Within thirty minutes, a ruthless plan to crush Fontaine Galleria took shape. He tapped his finger once on the glass, his eyes flat and unreadable.

"Go ahead and execute it." His order swept out with efficient finality.

Meanwhile, at the entrance of the Jones Group building, Erica showed up as she had all week, carrying a thermos of soup Aubrey had made for Vincent.

Today, though, the receptionist didn't even look up. Erica wasn't allowed inside; her name no longer appeared on the access list.

Erica dialed Vincent's private number without a second thought.The line rang, droning on-unyielding, impersonal, and endless.

She dialed again and again-once,twice, over a dozen times-each attempt ending in that cold, endless busy tone before a mechanical voice informed her the number couldn't be reached.It finally sank in: Vincent had blocked her.

The only explanation she could think of was the incident in his study being exposed. She tried calling Derek next, only to discover Vincent had also stripped her of building access. So that was it-Vincent was shutting every door in her face. Not
that was it-Vincent was shutting every door in her face. Not even a chance to plead her case.

Anger simmered under her skin. A sudden notification lit up her phone. The private eye she'd paid to watch Hannah's house had just sent her a photo-Vincent, caught on camera coming and going from Hannah's house, the timestamp a mocking reminder it was only last night. So that was how it was.

Jealousy and resentment coiled inside her chest, dark and poisonous. "Hannah Scott, you brought this upon yourself," she spat, her voice low and trembling with fury.
###Chapter 260 Wedding Anniversary


At Nova Tech, inside her office, Hannah kept her gaze fixed on the stack of proofs, her pen tapping lightly against the glossy paper. Before she could respond, her assistant, Meagan Harris, appeared at her side, practically shoving a tablet under her nose."Ms. Scott, you need to see this-Fontaine Galleria's all over the headlines!"

A bold notification from the finance app flashed across the screen: "Exclusive: Core Supplier Shakeup at Fontaine Galleria Sends Shares Plummeting Nearly 8% at Open."

Hannah gave the alert a glance and slid the tablet back toward Meagan, her tone even, unruffled."I see."

Meagan's voice broke in from across the table, laced with anxiety. "Our flagship's on the third floor of Fontaine Galleria, and the contract's already
finalized. The deposit's in. With the current negative reviews, is this going to blow back on us? Should we consider alternative locations?"

"There's no need." Hannah's response was brisk,leaving no room for debate. "We picked Fontaine Galleria because its steady flow of high-end customers is the result of decades spent building its reputation in the city's core commercial zone. A supplier switch is an internal shake-up, not something that changes our store's visibility or target market. As long as people keep coming, our exposure holds steady. Relocating and starting over would come with bigger expenses. Stick to the plan."

She barely finished before her phone buzzed sharply.Glancing at the caller ID, she answered without hesitation."Claude?"

Claude's voice came through the phone, smooth and inviting. "Dinner at seven tonight, Cloudtop Restaurant. Your parents are joiningus. Let's all sit down together-there's something I'd like to talk about."
Hannah glanced at the time and nodded,her answer soft but firm. "Okay, I'll be there."



When the clock struck seven, Hannah arrived at the Cloudtop Restaurant and slipped quietly inside. The soft glow of amber pendant lights illuminated her parents, who were already at their table, their expressions tinged with a hint of nervous anticipation.

Claude was seated beside her mother, his posture easy, his smile gentle as he murmured a few words to put her at ease. The moment he noticed Hannah, he rose from his seat, his eyes alight with affection."Anna."

Claude pulled out Hannah's chair himself, the gesture smooth and practiced-a quiet show of attentiveness.

He gave a discreet signal to the waiter, and soon,each artfully plated dish appeared on the table, their aromas mingling in the air.
With Claude steering the conversation into easy,cheerful territory, even Raymond and Margaret-who had arrived tense-slowly let their guard down.

Laughter started to thread through their dinner as they swapped stories from Raymond's wild younger days.

Suddenly, a muted vibration buzzed from the inside pocket of Claude's suit jacket-sharp and persistent.His easy smile didn't falter. He met everyone's eyes,polite as ever. "Excuse me, I need to take this."

He stood with effortless grace and made his way toward the balcony at the far end. The glass door whispered open and then closed behind him.

From where she sat, Hannah could only watch his silhouette, unable to make out any hint of his expression.

A few minutes later, Claude slipped back into his seat beside Hannah, that familiar gentle smile still in place. He took a long drink of water, as if washing away whatever tension lingered from his call.
"Everything alright? Was that about work?" Hannah's gaze flickered over him, picking up on the faint tremor beneath his calm surface.

Claude's eyes met hers, his smile unwavering, voice easy. "It's nothing-just a minor thing."

Hannah didn't push. She glanced away, letting the matter drop.

The mood at the table stayed light and untroubled.

Then, Claude set down his fork, quietly brushed his lips with a napkin, and shifted toward Raymond and Margaret. His expression grew earnest, a gentle resolve in his voice as he addressed them. "Mom,Dad, I brought everyone together tonight because there's something important I want to talk about."

He let the silence stretch just long enough to capture everyone's attention. "Your 50th wedding anniversary is just around the corner. I'd love to throw you a golden anniversary party."

Margaret's smile dropped as she waved her hands in
protest. "Absolutely not, Claude! That's way too much.Honestly, a quiet family dinner is all we need."

Raymond immediately backed her up, his voice resolute. "She's right, Claude. We really appreciate you wanting to do something, but there's no need for all that fuss."

Hannah chimed in, her tone steady and composed,"Claude, with their age, something big would just wear them out. We should keep it simple and warm-they'll enjoy that more."

In a heartbeat, the easy warmth in the room vanished, replaced by a strained hush.

Claude's smile faded slightly but did not vanish.Fixing his gaze on Margaret, he spoke with a warmth that was both reassuring and quietly insistent. "Mom,a party isn't too much. A golden anniversary only comes once in a lifetime. I just want you both to have no regrets."

He paused, his breath slightly heavier. "Trust me,I'll take care of everything."
Margaret and Raymond shared a look, uncertainty flickering between them.

Before Hannah could voice her hesitation, Claude gently clasped her hand, his tone coaxing. "Anna,let's just do it this way, all right?"

Hannah's lips pressed into a thin line. After a long moment, she gave a silent nod, resignation flickering in her eyes.



Meanwhile, from the far end of the corridor, the discreet door to a private suite slid open without a sound, and Vincent emerged, having just wrapped up a draining business engagement.

He drifted toward the edge of the observation deck,intending to clear his thoughts with a distant view-but his eyes caught on something below, and he stopped short.

Down on the terrace, Hannah's family and Claude sat clustered together, laughter blending with the warm
hum of conversation. Claude, with practiced ease,reached out and enveloped Hannah's hand in his own, his gesture intimate and unhurried. Hannah didn't recoil. She simply let him hold her.

A cold jolt ripped through Vincent. He spun away from the railing, his expression hardening, the very air growing brittle with his fury.

Derek instinctively edged backward, rattled by the sudden storm that seemed to roll off Vincent in waves.
###Chapter 261 Sudden Fire


Opening day at the VelaCore flagship brought a surge of energy to the Fontaine Galleria. The atrium overflowed with eager shoppers, their curiosity piqued by the futuristic glow spilling from the store's pristine windows.

Inside, beneath the spotlights, Hannah cut a striking figure in her tailored champagne skirt suit. Poised beside the ceremonial ribbon, she ran through the last-minute details with Meagan, her composure unflappable.

"Any word on Mr. Hobbes?" Hannah asked quietly,casting a glance at her watch.

Meagan's fingers flew over her phone, her nerves barely concealed. "Ms. Scott, his assistant says the meeting's still going. They'll do their best to get him here before the ribbon-cutting."

Given the recent media storm, Hannah could easily
imagine Claude being pulled in a dozen directions.She drew a steadying breath and replied, voice calm and assured, "We're moving forward. The ceremony starts on time-Mr. Hobbes or not."

Moments later, applause thundered through the atrium as the ribbon snapped and colorful confetti rained down, officially launching VelaCore's grand opening.

Hannah commanded the room, her presence steady and assured as she laid out the brand's vision to a sea of press and guests.

The event was reaching its peak, with the fitting experience zone buzzing and the crowd swelling.

Then, chaos ripped through the calm. A thick, acrid plume of smoke exploded from a ceiling vent, cutting through the air with the sharp stench of burning.

"Fire!" someone shouted, voice slicing above the music and chatter.

Flames erupted in a sudden burst from a seam
overhead, licking across the panel as smoke rolled down in choking waves. In seconds, the entire space filled with blinding haze.

Panic seized the crowd. They surged toward the exits in a wild stampede, frantic and disoriented-every second increasing the danger of trampling and disaster.

Hannah felt her pulse spike, but she forced down every instinctual tremor. Determination steeled her expression as she took charge. "Meagan! Launch the emergency evacuation protocol-now!"

Her tone sliced clean through the chaos, unwavering and absolute. "Security Team One, move! Use the green exit signs and guide everyone out-keep them moving and stay visible!"

She pivoted, projecting her voice over the din. "Team Two,get a loudspeaker.Direct people to stay low and stay calm. Tell them to use wet towels or sleeves to cover their mouths and noses. Nobody touches the elevators-take only the emergency stairs."
Every instruction rolled out crisp and fast, no room for doubt. Her eyes swept the terrified crowd,sharp and assessing. "All staff-assist whoever's nearest to you. Don't wait.Move."

The force of her authority snapped the staff into action, and the worst of the panic gave way to a shaky but coordinated evacuation.

But just as the crowd began to move-disaster struck again.

A desperate cry pierced the chaos. "Ms. Scott-there's a problem!" A staff member, her cheeks streaked with ash, stumbled over in a breathless panic. "There's a fire by the fitting area-sparks are shooting from the AC vent and spreading through the ducts! And a mother with her baby is trapped in a fitting room. She's unconscious!"

Hannah's pulse slammed. That corner was the most tucked-away section-and now thick, acrid smoke was rolling in fast. To make matters worse, she'd used elegant, heavy drapery there, all of it perfect tinder.
"You keep the evacuation line secure. I'm going in,"Hannah said sharply.

Snatching a half-empty water bottle from the staff member,Hannah doused her sleeve and pressed it to her mouth and nose. Heart pounding, she dropped into a crouch and sprinted straight into the smoke-choked corridor, making for the far corner fitting rooms.

Before long, she noticed the young mother slumped against the wall, clutching a screaming baby.

Smoke clawed at Hannah's throat, and she struggled to breathe. Her voice rasped through the smoke."Come on, you have to move!" She lunged forward,arm outstretched for the woman as she tried to gather the screaming baby against her side.

Suddenly, a violent crash tore through the chaos-chunks of flaming ceiling and twisted metal dlucts slammed to the floor, sealing off the closest exit with a wall of burning debris.

The mother crumpled, sobbing uncontrollably,
"We're trapped-we can't get out!"

Meanwhile, in the VIP lounge of the five-star hotel next to Fontaine Galleria, Vincent leaned back in an armchair upholstered in deep brown leather, his expression unreadable. His long fingers drummed quietly on the armrest as a regional director of a major luxury brand droned on about cross-brand initiatives and market projections.

The room's atmosphere was cool and formal-voices low, every gesture restrained.

Right then, Derek's phone buzzed. Without hesitation, he slipped behind Vincent, leaning in just enough to murmur, his voice nearly swallowed by the ambient noise. "Mr. Jones, urgent news-there's a fire at Fontaine Galleria. It's severe. Firefighters are already on the scene."

Vincent didn't so much as blink. His eyes stayed locked on the director across from him, betraying nothing. He offered the barest nod.

The director pressed on, every word measured and
impeccably smooth.

Soon, Derek's face changed again-a faint flicker of tension, his phone vibrating with a fresh update. He bent close a second time, dropping his tone to a sharp whisper laced with urgency. "The fire broke out on the third floor-right beside Ms. Scott's new store."

That landed like a gunshot. Vincent bolted upright,his composed mask obliterated by a split-second burst of naked panic.

"Meeting adjourned." His voice cut like ice. Without another word, he stormed out, moving with a suddenness that stunned the room.

The business associates present remained rooted in place, whispering anxiously among themselves, none of them quite sure what had just happened.

Derek gave a hasty bow, stammered a brief apoology and darted after Vincent.
When Vincent reached the scene, he was breathing hard,icy sweat prickling his brow.

Firefighters were already locked in battle with the flames.

Vincent spotted Hannah's assistant and demanded,"Tell me-where is Hannah?"

Meagan's lips trembled as she answered, her eyes raw and red, "Ms. Scott... she's still trapped in there."

Staring at the blaze, Vincent felt something seize in his chest-a cold, suffocating fear that rooted him to the spot.
###Chapter 262 No Chance Of Survival


Vincent barreled through the chaos, shouldering past firefighters and security without a flicker of hesitation. "Out of my way!" he barked, his voice cutting through the noise.

Someone attempted to block his way. "Sir, it's too dangerous! You can't go in!"

"| said move!" Vincent's intense gaze and commanding presence cowed those trying to stop him. He shoved past the barricade, uncaring of the consequences.

Smoke billowed thickly, stinging Vincent's eyes."Hannah!" he yelled, desperation raw in his throat.

Through the smoke, he glimpsed a shadow moving near the fitting rooms.

Without asecond thought, he yanked off his suit jacket, spotted a pool of water beside the fire hose,
and plunged the jacket in. Water streamed from the soaked fabric as he flung it around his shoulders and charged headlong into the smoke.

The fallen decorative panel crashed to the floor with a deafening bang, sending splinters skittering across the scorched tiles.

An instant later, flames tore through the opening,roaring straight toward Vincent.

Hannah whipped around, eyes wide with disbelief.Vincent-how had he forced his way in?

"Watch out!" Vincent barreled forward, ignoring the fiery tongues that licked at his back and shoulders.

He forged his way to Hannah and the mother clutching her child, stripping off his burning jacket and tossing it aside.

His voice rasped through the smoke, resolute and unyielding."This way-stay close!"

Hannah moved swiftly, her gaze locking onto the frightened mother. "Can you stand?" she queried,
urgency threading her words.

The woman gave a faint nod, her arms trembling.

"Hand me your child!" Hannah insisted, reaching out without hesitation and gathering the little one close against her chest.

Hannah then urged the mother, "Hold on to me and don't let go. Stay low-follow him, and keep your mouth and nose covered!"

Smoke surged thicker, swallowing the room in a choking haze.

Vincent moved fast, shoving aside burning debris to clear a path toward the window. He called over his shoulder, "Search for the thickest fabric you can find,and dampen it well!"

He needed something heavy enough to smash through the glass.

Eyes stinging, Hannah quickly scanned the smoky room. A metal cabinet loomed in the corner, its door hanging open. Cleaning supplies were stacked
inside.
"Over here!" She pressed the child back into the mother's trembling arms and lunged for the cabinet,groping through the shelves.

Her fingers closed around a handful of heavy,somewhat clean rags."Here-these will work!"

"Okay." Vincent snatched up a half-empty water bottle and drenched the rags without hesitation.

"Cover your nose and mouth!" he instructed,thrusting the soaked cloths into their hands. Without wasting a second, he charged at the blazing fireproof window, his fist wrapped in wet fabric as he hammered at the weakest corner.

Glass exploded outward with a sharp bang, leaving a jagged hole.

"Move!" Vincent shouted, urgency flaring in his voice. He scooped up the child, thrust him into the mother's trembling arms, and then seized Hannah's wrist in a vise-like grip. His palm radiated heat, but
his grasp was rock-solid and unyielding.

"Jump now! The air cushion's right there. Don't hesitate!" he ordered.

Vincent's every move was deliberate, not reckless.Before coming in, he'd mapped out the escape after quizzing Meagan about the building's layout andthe fitting room's location. He'd made Derek coordinate with the firefighters, ensuring the safety cushion was waiting directly below.

Clutching her child tightly, the mother stepped forward. Vincent steadied her, and she jumped,holding her child's head carefully, landing safely beyond the broken window.

As Hannah stepped forward, a splintered steel beam above groaned and threatened to collapse, sending a shower of burning debris crashing down. Vincent spun, pulling her tightly into his arms, shielding her as the wreckage fell.

For a heartbeat, the world held its breath in silence.
Fear crept into Hannah's voice as she called out,"Vincent?"

A tense, guttural sound escaped Vincent as he finally replied, "I'm alright."

Relief washed over Hannah; she exhaled shakily,forcing herself to stay calm.

Steeling himself, Vincent moved swiftly, urging Hannah toward the window.

After she landed safely, he was the only one left.He climbed onto the searing window ledge, took a breath, and hurled himself toward the air cushion waiting below.

But the moment his feet left the frame, a sudden whoosh split the air-a dormant side flame roared to life, unleashed by a hidden surge of fuel. A wall of fire burst from the opening and chased Vincent as he fell.

From below, rescuers and bystanders stared upward in horror. A deafening blast split the sky as a column
of fire shot up, instantly engulfing Vincent's falling silhouette in a blinding inferno.

The explosion's roar and the raging pillar of fire blasted through the crowd, silencing everyone in an instant. Every face blanched in terror, eyes wide with disbelief.

"My god, he must be gone-there won't even be bones left," someone whispered, panic breaking loose into a wave of horrified voices.

Derek's jaw tightened. He shot a glare at the murmuring crowd, his voice a sharp whisper. "Shut up!"

"Vincent!" Hannah's scream fractured mid-word,raw and desperate.

Her world seemed to tilt and freeze; air vanished from her lungs. Her legs buckled, trembling so violently that she nearly crumpled to the pavement.Did Vincent give his life to keep her safe?

A firefighter hurried over, catching her just before
she collapsed. "Ms. Scott!"

But the mutters behind her refused to stop. "No chance of survival..."

"Not even the rescue team dares go in there..."

###Chapter 263 Who Do You Want To Go With


The inflatable cushion sagged under Vincent's weight, his motionless body sprawled in the center.

Hannah's heart seized in her chest. For one endless instant, everything inside her turned to ice-breath caught, thoughts blank, the world frozen.

Then, a subtle movement broke the spell; a twitch at the cushion's center.

Slowly and painfully, Vincent dragged himself upright, wracked by harsh, guttural coughs. Each spasm contorted his battered body, agony etched into every breath. Soot smeared his features, blood and sweat mingling on skin split and torn by cuts. His shirt hung in charred ribbons, exposing patches of blistered, seared flesh beneath.

Vincent clawed at the smoke-choked air, gasping,
every rise and fall of his chest a battle for breath.

A stunned hush swept across the crowd before erupting in disbelief.

"Holy crap, he's alive!"

"No way-he actually made it? That's impossible!"

Vincent lurched upright from the battered air cushion, his body racked with violent coughs.Smoke still clung to his skin and hair. For a heartbeat, he seemed disoriented, lost in the chaos-until his gaze found Hannah in the mass of faces. She stood motionless, pale and trembling, braced by the supportive arm of a bystander.

Derek blinked away tears and, without a word,crossed over to Vincent's side.

Hannah's mind still reeled, but her body carried her forward on instinct alone. She pressed through the wall of onlookers, step by shaky step, until she finally stood just a few feet away from Vincent, swaying uncertainly. Her words came out thin and raw. "You...
you're alive?"

Vincent lifted his head, catching the single tear that slid down her cheek and struck him like a blow. The sight seemed to scorch right through him.

He struggled for breath, voice rough with pain and lingering smoke. "Guess I got lucky... hit the cushion at just the right angle. Most of the force missed me.Just knocked the air out of my lungs."

He tried to explain why he'd lain there so long-why he looked half-dead on that cushion. But the moment he saw the tears streaming down her face, any explanation withered away.

"Thank you..." Hannah's sobs tumbledout with the words.

Suddenly, she lunged forward. Before Vincent could process what was happening, she wrapped her arms around him-clinging tight, her whole body trembling.

The hug hit him like a tidal wave-desperate,
overwhelming,real.

That single "thank you" wasn't just gratitude for dragging her out of the fire-it was relief he was stil breathing.

Pressed against his chest, Hannah's body shook with silent cries. Vincent stood rigid, caught off guard.Then, almost involuntarily, his fingers curled at his sides, heat flaring up beneath his skin, flooding his aching limbs. For a moment, the world shrank to just her in his arms. His pulse thundered, wild and unsteady, as if his heart was fighting its way back to life.

Vincent's hand hovered at her waist, holding her as if she were spun glass, every muscle in his arm tensed by awe and uncertainty. For a breathless instant, he simply held her-unsure, almost reverent, afraid a single wrong move might shatter the fragile moment.

But the second his arm settled, something inside Hannah jolted violently awake. Cold logic crashed over her, drowning out every raw impulse. Her spine locked up; panic pulsed through her chest. What on
earth was she doing clinging to him like this?

Flushed with embarrassment, she tried to break away.

"Ah!" As she made to draw herself back, Vincent sucked in a ragged breath, pain lancing through him,his jaw clenched against it.

His arm instinctively tightened around her, his knuckles white as pain flickered across his face."Don't move. It hurts." His voice came out strained and uneven, the final word barely audible-a single,shattered breath.

That frail sound pinned Hannah in place, her eyes flying wide as heat rushed to her cheeks.

Just as she was about to react, the charged stillness snapped.

"Hannah." Claude's voice, deep and proprietary,sliced through the commotion. He barreled forward,brushing aside anyone in his way.

Within seconds, Claude was beside Hannah, ignoring
Vincent entirely as he seized her wrist with a grip that brooked no argument.

The abrupt yank nearly knocked her off her feet sending her stumbling into Claude's chest. Pain shot up her arm where his fingers dug into her skin.

Vincent's arm was ripped away from her waist so abruptly that pain shot through the wound on his back, wringing a raw groan from deep in his chest.

His head jerked up, fury flaring in his eyes-a blaze of outrage at being torn from her side.

For a split second, his balance faltered, and Derek darted in, steadying him with a firm hand.

Claude's gaze never left Hannah. "Are you hurt anywhere?" His voice was heavy with worry.
Hannah stiffened under the scrutiny, quickly shaking her head. "I'm fine. Just... breathed in a little smoke."

Relief flooded Claude's face. He exhaled shakily and moved in closer, lining himself up protectively beside her. Glancing at Vincent, he offered a clipped
apology. "Mr. Jones, please forgive the abruptness.I acted out of urgency."

He lifted his chin, pride simmering beneath his measured politeness-a territorial edge unmistakable in the way he held himself. The corner of his mouth twitched with a hint of a smile. "Your courage today-putting your life on the line for others-I'll remember that."

Vincent didn't acknowledge Claude. Instead, he turned to Hannah, eyes fixed on her, and reached out a steady hand. "Come with me. Let's go to the hospital."

Claude's expression hardened. Without hesitation,he clamped onto Hannah's wrist, making his intent clear. "That won't be necessary. My medical team is almost here."

His fingers bit into her skin, the possessiveness in his hold impossible to miss. Her breath hitched, a flash of discomfort in her eyes.

Vincent's hand remained outstretched, his voice
unwavering, quiet but resolute. "It's your choice.
Who do you want to go with?"
###Chapter 264 False Hope


A heavy stillness settled over the place, prickling with tension.

Claude shot Hannah a sidelong look, clearly awaiting her decision.

But Hannah didn't look at Claude. Her attention stayed locked on Vincent, and his question made her brow knit in exasperation. He still found time to bicker about this? If Derek weren't practically holding him upright, Vincent would have already crumpled.He was the one who desperately needed medical treatment.

Exhaling softly, Hannah slid her wrist free from Claude's grip.

Claude's hand hovered in midair, stunned by her quiet defiance.

As she strode toward Vincent, disbelief flared in
Claude's eyes. For a moment, he looked ready to shout, but all that escaped was a ragged, strangled gasp.

Vincent's heart hammered wildly as Hannah drew closer, every footstep tightening the thundering in his chest. A wave of elation crashed over him,drowning out every throb of pain in his body. She was worried about him-she still cared.

The tender spark from their earlier embrace had ignited a fragile hope, a longing so sharp that he could barely breathe.

Swaying slightly, Vincent reached for her, the rest of the world fading to a distant blur. All he wanted was to take her hand, to escape this place with her by his side.

But just as his fingers were about to brush hers, just as he opened his mouth to speak, his eyes tinged with irrepressible joy, Hannah stopped, one step away. She didn't glance at his outstretched hand.She didn't spare a look for his pale, drawn face.
Her eyes cut past Vincent, zeroing in on Derek behind him. She spoke with steady, unwavering authority. "Mr. Barrett, what are you waiting for?Rush him to the hospital. Now. His injury needs immediate treatment-any delay could make it worse.Move."

Derek immediately straightened. "Yes, Ms. Scott!" he answered loudly, hurrying to steady Vincent's swaying frame.

The faint light in Vincent's eyes flickered out. All the hope that had surged up moments before drained away, leaving his face drawn and colorless. So that was it-she hadn't walked over to leave with him.She'd come only to ensure someone took him to the hospital.Just that. Nothing more.

Vincent's voice came out strained and low, barely above a whisper. "And you?"

She turned aside, refusing to meet his gaze. Her voice came out calm and unyielding. "Claude already brought his medical team."
Something in Vincent's chest gave way-a brittle,hollow snap. So that embrace had been meaningless.He'd convinced himself she still cared, that her heart might have softened toward him. But he'd only been fooling himself.

Claude's anger evaporated, replaced by a sudden flash of victory. He strode forward with bold,unrestrained confidence and clutched Hannah's wrist, as if staking his claim. "Let's go," he said, his voice gentler than before but unmistakably possessive.

Hannah dropped her eyes, refusing to look at anyone.She replied softly, almost inaudibly, "Alright."

"Mr. Jones, let me help you to the car," Derek said urgently, eager to get Vincent away from the scene.

But Vincent didn't budge. He remained motionless,as if the ground itself refused to let him go.

"Mr. Jones?" Derek's gentle prompt barely reached Vincent.
Vincent stood transfixed, staring after Hannah and Claude as they vanished into the waiting car. Claude opened the door with a protective flourish, shielding Hannah. The door slammed with a finality that sent a tremor through Vincent's chest, severing his last glimpse of her.

Only when the car had vanished around the corner did Vincent blink and force himself to move. "Let's go," he muttered, his voice rough and scarcely more than a whisper.

Derek released a slow sigh and carefully helped Vincent into the back seat, handling him as if he might shatter.

Across town, Erica lounged back, swirling her wine with a smirk as the TV flickered with breaking news.She'd just lifted the glass to her lips when her phone buzzed.

Seeing the caller, she answered with bored satisfaction, "I already know. The rest of the payment's on the way."
Just as she was about to hang up, the caller spoke,voice tight, breathless, brimming with urgency."Hannah Scott survived-the fire didn't kill her."

Erica's triumphant smirk vanished in an instant. Her fingers clenched around the glass, eyes narrowing into icy slits as fury flared in their depths.

The caller continued, "And Mr. Jones... He was there.Ran straight into the flames for her. He almost didn't make it out."

Erica snapped. The wineglass struck the floor and exploded, scattering glass across the tiles.

She shot upright, breath ragged and eyes blazing."How could Vincent once again save that woman!"she spat her words through clenched teeth. "He really couldn't let her go? He'd die before walking away from her?"

Defeat twisted her face, resentment burning in every line. Why? Why was it always Hannah-only Hannah -that Vincent saw?
Erica dragged in a trembling breath, wrestling her fury back under control. "Useless bastard," she muttered, unclear whether she meant the caller or someone else.

She strode over to the window, voice suddenly cold and measured. "Proceed with the next step. As planned."
###Chapter 265 His Notes


Two days later, Hannah remained solitary within the frigid inquiry chamber of the police station.

Opposite her, the officer arranged documentation while declaring with authority, "Ms. Scott, according to findings thus far-including location analysis,security camera review, and preliminary material evaluation-the blaze's source was conclusively traced to the electrical circuit cluster within your store's renovation section. The initial explanation indicates an unplanned ignition caused by excessive heat buildup in deteriorated wiring, which subsequently lit surrounding flammable decorative components."

"Unplanned ignition?" Hannah's head jerked upward,her intense gaze flaring with skepticism. "Officer,every electrical circuit in my store underwent thorough verification during remodeling. We carried out an extensive safety inspection just seventy-two
hours before launch-there's absolutely no chance the wiring condition was degraded enough to trigger this. In what world could that happen spontaneously?"

Her voice rose with agitation. "Additionally, the flames accelerated in an unusual pattern back then,erupting nearly at once from several directions.That's incredibly suspicious! I believe there's foul play..."

The officer cut in with emphasis. "Ms. Scott, your apprehension is acknowledged. We're equally intent on uncovering the full story. Yet presently, the trail of evidence supports unintentional ignition tied to circuitry malfunction. Arson evaluations require verifiable facts-not gut feelings or assumptions.Should you acquire fresh information or solid proof,do not hesitate to alert us. But as of this moment,this stands as our initial determination."

Hannah bit her lower lip, recalling the strange silhouette she'd seen before the incident-someone garbed in Fontaine Galleria's attire loitering near her
renovation materials, but the security footage failed to reach that corner. No proof existed now, and confronting law enforcement using only hunches would be fruitless.

Once her statement was recorded, she exited the police station-and at that moment, her phone buzzed. It was Derek on the line.

She picked up, her tone holding a trace of emotional distance. "Is something wrong?"

"Ms. Scott," Derek's voice came through clearly, "I saw you coming out. If you're free, could I speak with you briefly? I'm parked left of you, in the black Maybach."

Hannah glanced over and spotted the recognizable vehicle stationed beside the curb not far away. Her brows pinched slightly, and she instinctively asked "Did Vincent send you?"

"No!" Derek responded firmly, his words quickened with urgency, "Ms. Scott, this is something I need to share. It involves Mr. Jones, but I assure you, this
isn't his order."

He hesitated and then added, "I saw you coming to give a statement, so l waited here for you."

Hannah paused, her eyes filled with conflict as they landed on the vehicle. After a few beats of indecision, she stepped toward the car. After all,Vincent had ended up wounded while protecting her.

Entering the rear seat, Hannah casually inquired,"What's the pressing issue?"

Derek didn't reply right away, but instead, appearing grave, reached over to retrieve a plain brown envelope from the front and extended it toward Hannah:

Hannah accepted it with curiosity and jokingly asked,"Are you pitching a collaboration? Why the secrecy?"

"You'll get it once you open it." Derek offered a weak smile.

Hannah, eyeing him warily, unfolded the flap and pulled out a small collection of printed sheets. What
she saw stopped her-it wasn't business-related material.

Instead, they were candid pictures of herself, each captioned with brief remarks.

One showed her during a vision checkup. Vincent had scribbled, "Week two post-sight recovery-monitoring progress is essential."

Another captured her requesting a vegetable salad with a warm latte. He'd noted, "Salad? She never liked it before." Then, heavily struck through,replaced by: "Making healthier decisions is encouraging."

One revealed her surveying a developed commercial property recently. He'd written, "Is the workload intense?"

And there was a snapshot of her dining out with team members, grinning among them. He'd commented,"What brought her such joy today?"

She noticed the timestamps on the images-they
aligned with the period shortly after her eyesight returned. During those two months, neither of them had reached out.

As Hannah kept going, her expression grew darker."Has Mr. Jones decided to moonlight as a private detective?"

"Please don't take it the wrong way." Derek quickly caught the chill in her voice and explained, "Mr.Jones absolutely wasn't tailing you constantly! He was just in a dark place back then. A few times, he couldn't restrain himself-he lacked any justification to see or contact you, so he sometimes requested updates about you, just to be reassured you were safe. There was no ill intent-Iswear!"

She lifted her gaze, replying only with an indifferent "Hmm," her tone unreadable. "You approached me just to show these?" She scowled slightly, her eyes narrowing at him.
###Chapter 266 Just Returning A Favor


Derek continued cautiously, each word laced with urgency, "What I'm attempting to convey is that Mr.Jones tends to be... overwhelming in how he treats you, and at times, he could be quite stubborn-though he doesn't intend any damage. It's just... he lacks the ability to handle things appropriately.Especially when it comes to you. He always seems to handle things the absolute wrong way..."

Handled things the wrong way? Hannah fell into thought, unsure if she was really listening to Derek's words.

With a long inhale, Derek pushed forward. "Ms.Scott,could you please try to persuade Mr. Jones?"

A subtle flicker crossed Hannah's brow, but she gave no verbal reply.

Derek's words came faster, tension rising. "The injuries across his back are serious. The doctor
strongly recommended bed rest, as the wounds might otherwise scar and become easily infected. On top of that, jumping through the window left him with minor fractures and damage to his lungs, leaving him terribly fragile and needing recovery."

He gave her a short break to register the details."He's only been admitted for two nights, and the moment the fever reduced a little, even while still aching from the bones, he's been pushing himself to handle business matters. He's behaving recklessly,dead set on checking himself out and getting back to work. He won't listen to medical instructions,brushes off his grandmother and mother with just a 'I'm fine. And now he says he wants to dlischarge tomorrow!"

Derek's tone grew thick with desperation. "You know his temper, stubborn as a bull! Once he settles on something, nobody can stop him! His workload has been intense lately, and I worry he'll collapse again,like last time. That's why I'm pleading for your help;maybe he'll take your words seriously, even if only a little."
The car sank into stillness.

Hannah turned to the window, watching the street lights blur by. After what felt like minutes, she finally replied, her voice void of tone, like making a neutra observation, "Don't talk like he would listen to me.Besides, he and I are already no longer married."

She shifted slightly and suggested, "If he insists on leaving the hospital, have the doctor accompany him 24/7. That's the most practical route."

"Ms.Scott..." Derek tried one more time.

"Drop me off at the next intersection," Hannah instructed, pointing toward the illuminated signal ahead.

"Yes, Ms. Scott," Derek answered hesitantly, easing on the brakes.

The vehicle glided to a stop beside the curb.

Hannah undid her belt and reached for the handle.

Derek added softly before the door closed, "Ms.
Scott! The night the divorce was finalized, Mr. Jones sat alone in the study and drank until morning. When I cleaned up afterward, your name was carved deeply into the desk."

He murmured the words like they were meant for no one.

Hannah's motion halted for a second, her eyes clouded as if staring into space, her face unreadable.She offered no comment, stepped out, and walked forward without looking back, vanishing around the block.

Derek watched her vanish, breathing out slowly as the black Maybach merged into the moving traffic.



***

Hannah found herself in the grocery store, her steps inexplicably halting in the fresh produce section, her gaze involuntarily landing on the neatly packaged beans in the counter...

By the time she realized, she'd returned to her
doorstep, a full bag of veggies and ham in hand.

She brought the items toward the kitchen.

Her mother sat nearby, engrossed in a melodrama.She looked up in surprise when she saw Hannah getting ready to cook. "You're making food yourself,Anna? No takeout tonight?"

Hannah replied vaguely, "Mm."

She didn't smile as she walked into the kitchen and began preparing the meal.

Her mother, sensing the lack of cheer, figured she must be exhausted and said nothing else.

Inside the kitchen, the broth simmered steadily,the scent of the stew gradually filling the room.

Hannah stared into the pot, ladled a bit into a bowl,and took a taste. The spices were balanced, and the flavor had depth. Still, it feIt flavorless. The liquid caught in her throat, unwilling to go down.

With a scowl, she shoved the bowl away.
"Why should I care?" came a cold internal remark.

Hannah walked off for a bath and then lay down in bed afterward, eyes shut, feeling like each minute stretched forever.

She twisted beneath the covers. Derek's words about "discharging tomorrow" echoing in her mind.

She peeked at her phone-it read 11:00 sharp.

Suddenly, she bolted upright. With a quiet sense of defiance, she pulled on fresh clothes, picked a clean thermal flask, and poured in the hot broth, tightening thelid.

The warmth from the container pressed into her palm like a scald. Just returning a favor. That was it.Nothing more.

At Dorbarrow Hospital, Vincent rested against the headboard, a soft cushion supporting him. His face was tight with strain, fingers tapping lightly on the laptop keys, the monitor casting a blue hue over his pale complexion.
Hannah inhaled deeply, tapped twice on the door,and then entered without invitation.

Vincent's head snapped up at the sound, eyes locking onto the visitor. When he saw Hannah, his eyes slightly widened, fingers stilling.

"Am I not welcome?" Hannah asked, breaking the silence.
###Chapter 267 Maybe | Have Been A Bit Unpredictable Lately


Vincent's gaze flicked to the glowing digits on his monitor-11:47 p.m. His brows furrowed even deeper.His voice rasped with exhaustion, the roughness betraying both sickness and too many sleepless nights. "You decided to check on a patient this late?"

Hannah dropped the thermos onto his nightstand with a purposeful clatter. She angled her face away from him, dodging his intense eyes. Her tone was brisk, edged with a forced nonchalance that didn't quite hide the tension beneath. "Why not? I've barely had a moment to breathe. This was the only window l had."

"Even with your schedule packed... you still made time for me." Vincent's stare lingered on her, quiet and searching. "Were you concerned?"

His mouth curved, the hint of a smile barely there.
Hannah ignored his question entirely,busying herself with scooping soup from the thermos, her movements brisk and precise. She extended the bowl toward him. "Try a bit."

Vincent's gaze lingered on her face, reading her expression before he finally looked down at the bowl.He didn't take it right away. Instead, he looked up,meeting her slightly evasive eyes. "Did you cook this?"

Her denial came sharp and fast-almost too fast."No, obviously not." Her voice hitched, betraying a flicker of embarrassment. "I just picked it up from a restaurant."

She thrust the bowl into his hands, hiding her discomfort behind a prickly edge. "Come on-before it gets cold."

Vincent didn't press further. He accepted the bowl in silence. He sipped at the soup unhurriedly, each taste echoing in the hush of the room-only the quiet scrape of his spoon and the soft sound of swallowing filled the space.
After a few spoonfuls, he shattered the silence. "So what dragged you here at midnight?"
His words were gentle, barely above a whisper, but in the stillness, they seemed to hang between them.

Hannah made a show of adjusting the thermos lid,but the motion faltered for a second at his words.She kept her gaze lowered, her voice deliberately sharp. "I just wanted to check if you were still breathing.Heard from Derek you're planning to check yourself out tomorrow? Are you trying to get yourself killed?"

Hannah finally looked up, meeting his eyes with a flash of dry defiance. "Vincent, you really believe the company will fall apart just because you're gone for a day?"

Vincent's grip tightened ever so slightly on his spoon, but he let the jab slide. Instead, he studied her for a long moment, taking in every nuance of her expression. "What about you? How are you holding up?"
The question caught her off balance, and her lips parted in surprise. "Me? What are you even asking?"

He leaned in, voice deepening, steady as a heartbeat. "After the fire, didn't Claude rush you to the hospital? Are you all right?"

Hannah shifted in her seat, suddenly uneasy beneath the weight of his gaze. The raw concern in his voice threatened to unravel her composure, and she found herself glancing away. "I'm fine," she replied, her voice clipped, every syllable sharp with distance.

She leaned in, shifting the topic. "But you, Vincent-what on earth are you thinking? Your back's still a mess, your fracture's nowhere close to healed, and now you're talking about heading back to work tomorrow? What are you, made of steel?"

Vincent's posture stiffened under her barrage, her frustration cutting through the air. He dropped the bowl on the nightstand. He studied her for a moment and then spoke in that steady, matter-of-fact way."You're concerned about me."
There was no hint of a question-just quiet certainty.

Hannah shot back instantly, her voice rising with indignant denial, "Concerned about you? Get over yourself!"

She even unconsciously took a half step back.

Vincent dropped his gaze, reaching for the now-lukewarm soup sitting on the nightstand. He gave it a slow stir, the spoon circling with a faint clink as he searched for something to say. "The soup's not bad,"he murmured.

Hannah's tone returned to its earlier sharpness."Forget the soup! I want an answer-are you seriously planning to discharge yourself tomnorrow?"

Vincent stayed focused on his bowl, taking a slow spoonful. He swallowed, waited a beat, and then replied in his steady, unreadable way, "I am."

Hannah's expression clouded over. Her lips parted,ready to unleash another tirade.

But Vincent looked up, eyes locking on hers, the hint
of a smile flickering at the corner of his mouth. The icy mask he'd worn all night melted just enough for a sliver of warmth to break through. "But, actually," he said, voice softer, "my mood's better now. Since I'm feeling decent, maybe there's no rush to leave after all."

The sudden shift' in his demeanor left Hannah momentarily speechless. She found herself blurting out, "Unbelievable. You really are impossible to figure out."

Vincent barely reacted to her barb, only following her words with a thoughtful frown, as if weighing her accusation seriously. "Maybe I have been a bit unpredictable lately," he admitted, voice low and even.

He brushed aside the thought and steered the conversation toward the fire report. Hannah summarized the current report, explaining that investigators blamed the incident on a wiring fault-just an accident, as far as anyone could tell.

Vincent listened, his expression unreadable, until a
hard line creased his brow. "Claude's got some explaining to do about all this."

Hannah shot back without thinking, "You can't pin everything on Claude. He might've been in charge,but he was blindsided like the rest of us. Fontaine Galleria took a real hit."

Vincent's face turned to stone. "You never miss a chance to shield him, do you?" His voice dropped to an icy whisper. "How touching. Tell me-are you two already planning your happy ending? Is this your big reveal?"
###Chapter 268 And He Knows How To Charm You


Hannah paused briefly, something dawning on her.Her lashes fluttered, and she cocked her head at Vincent. "Are you upset?"

"No," Vincent replied, eyes shifting away. "I'm fine."The final syllables dragged out, strained through gritted teeth.

But Hannah stared at him like a code had been cracked, her gaze glued to his face, tightened with suppressed fury.

This marked the second occasion she'd witnessed his temper sparked by another man by her side. The first had been when she shared a dance with Miles,and his glare had carved straight through the crowd like a blade, suffocating in its sharpness.

But Vincent had never reacted like that before.
During their marriage, when admirers circled her, he had worn the same blank mask, unaffected and silent. No anger, no questions, as though men orbiting her were no more unusual than air.

That had once convinced Hannah that Vincent held no affection for her. Yet after their separation, those hidden expressions emerged-clear, unfiltered. He was furious because another man stood too close to her.

That understanding sparked a quiet intrigue in her, as if she had just uncovered a crucial piece of a puzzle.So, she let her lips curl, faintly amused, as if she'd just heard a brilliant punchline, and with a deliberately flammable sweetness, said, "Why not?Claude is truly remarkable."

Her gaze pierced his, and she added, "He treats my parents with such kindness, and he's even more considerate to me."

Vincent's stare turned frigid. "Then leave," he said flatly, tone as final as a slammed door. "Go be with Claude."
He even lifted one arm to gesture toward the exit, the motion stiff from the strain in his spine.

"Alright," Hannah answered sharply, as if those words had been a long-awaited cue. She pivoted on her heel,her pace brisk, not a shred of hesitation slowing her down.

Her swift decision hit Vincent like a dagger plunged straight into his chest.

As her hand reached for the metal knob, Vincent,acting on pure instinct, rose from the mattress and snatched her wrist with a grip that brooked no refusal.

"Ow..." The jerk awakened pain in his back, and a groan escaped him as he staggered slightly,his body recoiling in agony. Still, his hold on her wrist remained unrelenting, tightening in reflex as his pain intensified.

The jolt tugged Hannah off balance, forcing her a step backward toward the bed. Her footing wobbled,and she nearly landed on the mattress's edge,
cutting the space between them in half.

She raised her eyes to his, finding a hurricane swirling behind them. "Vincent." She noticed how pale he'd gone, the sweat clinging to his brow,and blurted,"You..."

She wanted to scold him for his recklessness, but what escaped her mouth was the question that had kept her awake all night. "Why do you react like this every time Claude is involved?"

Her voice, carried at such close range, rang sharp and unwavering, demanding a reply.

Vincent's pulse thudded violently beneath his ribs,erratic and loud beneath the pain. The contact of her skin against his sent a flush straight through him,scattering his thoughts.

"Because..." he rasped,voice nearly swallowed by his own hesitation, dry and broken. He fumbled for language that could carry the weight and finally surrendered two syllables. "Jealous, perhaps."
Hannah's eyes widened slightly, a hint of disbelief dancing before shifting into something more curious."Jealous?"

She leaned in, inching closer until her breath warmed his skin, echoing his admission with a voice drenched in mockery. "You're jealous of him? You, Vincent,jealous of Claude?"

Her breath grazed his cheek, and his heart stumbled over itself before sinking deeper into trembling chaos.

"Yes." He shut his eyes for a moment, and when they opened again, defeat shimmered within the shadows."He knows how to charm your parents."

A trace of sourness slipped into the words, so faint that he didn't even realize it.

The phrase "and he knows how to charm you"trembled on the edge of his tongue, but he crushed it down, releasing only a heavy exhale.

Stillness claimed the space between them.
Hannah's eyes never left him. Her voice dropped,heavy with meaning and laced with something deeper than before. "Vincent, when the building was burning, why did you risk your life to rush in?"
###Chapter 269 You've Fallen In Love With Me


Vincent paused, shoulders tense, and then finally met Hannah's gaze. "Honestly? I didn't dwell on it.You were inside, so I went in."

Hannah's eyes sharpened, her tone growing weightier, pressing himn for more. "Then explain why you had someone watching me for those two months after | regained my sight."

He let out a breath, the faintest trace of a bitter smile tugging'at his lips. "Curiosity," he admitted, the word rough in his throat. He wanted to know how she'd been without him.

His voice held a trace of awkwardness and bitterness. Even after cutting her out and trying to convince himself he was done, that stubborn,gnawing urge to know how she was holding up without him had refused to fade.
The admission sat between them, heavy and raw.

Hannah's mouth thinned, her fingers curlíng unconsciously against her palm, something uncertain shadowing her eyes. She didn't let the silence stretch. Leaning in, her stare pinned him,voice low and unwavering. "And the gala? Why did you insist l be your dancing partner, even if it meant facing off against Miles?"

A muscle jumped in Vincent's jaw. When he spoke,his voice was brisk and edged with something sharp."Didn't want you to dance with someone the tabloids already link you to."

No hesitation.Just brutal, unvarnished logic.

Hannah's lips curved in a knowing smile-a small,luminous shift that said she finally understood something.

Before Vincent could react, she closed the distance between them in a single, graceful movement.Her lashes brushed the edge of his cheek, stealing the air between them.
His thoughts splintered; eyes flaring wide, he stiffened, swallowing hard as heat climbed his neck.

"Vincent..." Her whisper was silk against his ear-breathless and electric, landing with the force of a confession. "Don't you see it by now?"

He could only manage a hoarse, "What?" His voice barely rose above a whisper, the world narrowing to her nearness, every sense on high alert.

She didn't respond immediately. Instead, she studied him, gaze lingering as she slowly lifted her right hand and pressed it to his chest, the thin cotton of his hospital gown offering no barrier to the frantic rhythm beneath.

Thump, thump... His heartbeat thundered against her palm, wild and unmistakable, echoing between them in the stillness.

Her eyes never left his, searching, unflinching.She drew a breath, lips parting as she spoke with steady,unshakable confidence. "You've fallen in love with me."
Her voice was soft, but there was no mistaking the certainty in her words. "This heartbeat doesn't lie.It's all the proof I need."

While she spoke, her fingertip brushed over his heart in a slow, delicate circle.

Vincent froze, tension locking every muscle. A dizzy rush swept through him, leaving his head hot andhis pulse roaring in his ears.

A wild storm brewed in his eyes, every thought drowned out by the thunder of his own heartbeat.

He couldn't think straight. His gaze slid from her steady eyes to the curve of her lips-soft, inviting,dangerously close. His body moved before his mind could catch up.

Guided by pure instinct, his eyelids fluttered low, a raw need flickering in his expression as he bent closer-drawn to Hannah's lips, desperate to quiet her in the most undeniable way.

Their breaths collided-hot, shallow, mingling in the
narrow gap that barely separated them.

Just as hislips hovered, trembling, a heartbeat away from hers, Hannah suddenly turned aside, swift and sure. His mouth brushed nothing but the hush she left behind.

Her hand, steady and unyielding against his chest,gave a sharp push.

Unprepared, Vincent toppled backward, hitting the pillow with a jarring thud. Agony lanced through his spine, wrenching a rough groan from his lips and dousing his fevered mind in cold, brutal clarity. Blood drained from his face as reality crashed back in.

Hannah had already put distance between them,composed and poised, her gaze cold and unflinching. A mocking curl tugged at her mouth, her voice heavy with finality. "Too bad. I don't love you anymore."

Not pausing, she swept a hand down her sleeve,spun on her heel, and strode for the door-every step clipped, brisk, unmistakably resolute.
Her words echoed behind her, cold and razor-precise, carving a merciless path straight through Vincent's chest. He remained there, watching her retreat, a numbness flooding in so suddenly that it left him reeling-as if the ground had been yanked away and he was left hovering in freefall.

Then, the thought struck, slicing through the fog.Ridiculous, jarring, and impossible to ignore. Was he in love with her? No way. He was Vincent Jones-the architect of empires, a man who thrived on control,calculation, and power. He didn't unravel over a woman. He didn't throw himself into something as chaotic, as pointless, as love.

Every instinct in Vincent screamed at him to kill the feeling, to slam the gates shut and bury the words in scorn-just as he always had.

But Hannah's voice-"You've fallen in love with me"_refused to fade. The phrase echoed relentlessly,battering the cold defenses he'd spent a lifetime perfecting.

For the first time, Vincent had drifted in unfamiliar
territory, genuinely adrift.
Across the corridor, Hannah strode off at a quick pace, but inside, her pulse remained astonishingly steady.

The answer she'd once ached for-eight years of desperate hoping, of soul-baring pleas for a scrap of tenderness-had finally materialized.

It hadn't come in the form of a heartfelt confession of feelings. Instead, it was the steady proof of his racing heart. And now, having received what she'd once wanted more than anything, she felt no surge of joy,no giddy triumph. Just a profound quietness.A sense of quiet closure, as if every tangled emotion had finally clicked into place, and she could-at last-let go.
###Chapter 270 Defamation


Following internal restructuring, VelaCore resumed operations quietly from its position on the third tier of Fontaine Galleria.

Hannah altered her business tactics, emphasizing selective high-end VIP treatments and a digital-first booking system.

Retail functions were mostly restored. But online slander started gaining traction.

Everything kicked off through vague insinuations published on lesser-known local forums. The headlines were lurid.

"Tech Queen? Discover What Hannah Scott Allegedly Traded for Her Association with the CEO of Fontaine Galleria!"

"Nova Tech's Lingerie Is Murderous? Read This User Horror Story!"
Though the pieces lacked sophistication, they were expertly aimed. Within seconds, coordinated troll accounts activated-spamming timelines, duplicating threads, unleashing a digital onslaught.

Accusations alleged Hannah had performed "unethical exchanges" with Claude, the head of Fontaine Galleria, implying physical appeal was her method for securing a prime location and ongoing support from Fontaine Galleria.

Low-quality, skewed snapshots of alleged "private encounters" were offered as supposed "proof".

Worse still were anonymous "victims" alleging VelaCore smart underwear caused "long-term allergic reactions", with its material said to harbor "dangerous cancer-causing agents".

Alongside these claims were disturbing dermatological photos and falsified chat exchanges.

The firestorm thrust Hannah under public scrutiny.
"Ms. Scott! This is awful!" Meagan dashed into the
boutique, nearly tripping, her expression ghostly as she extended a tablet toward Hannah. The display showed venomous messages and distorted images that were rapidly being shared.

Preoccupied with elite guests, Hannah hadn't yet reviewed media updates. A short glance was all it took-her gaze hardened, the fury in her stare nearly piercing the screen.

As hostility surged online, some VIP patrons silently considered leaving the premises, only for three average-looking middle-aged women to storm in like launched projectiles.

"Hannah Scott, you wicked woman, fix my daughter's severe, persistent skin allergies!" bellowed a plump woman who dropped to the floor, sobbing, hoisting a banner with scarlet script-"Hannah Scott Sells Poisoned Lingerie That Destroys Skin! Face the Consequences!" and "Fontaine Galleria's Claude Hobbes Covers for His Mistress Hannah Scott,Endangering Everyone!"

The explosive accusations shattered the store's
composed atmosphere.

Before anyone could collect themselves, another furious woman yanked two heavy black garbage bags from beneath her jacket, filled with revolting,dense sludge. With a crazed glint, she shrieked,"May ruin fall on all of you!"

She flung the bags straight at the glass case displaying high-end wearable tech.

A thunderous shatter followed as dark red goo exploded across the showroom, releasing an overpowering chemical reek. Costly lace garments were drenched in grime.

The store fell silent, soon broken by the terrified screams of a few VIP customers.

The store staff stood motionless, covering their mouths in shock.

"Protect the customers!" Hannah's tone remained composed. She swiftly positioned herself as a barrier between chaos and the unsettled VIP clientele.
"Security, guide all VIPs to the private chamber via the secure route." Her voice rang with unmistakable control and confidence.

Disorder was abruptly suppressed. Simultaneously,two guards snapped out of their daze and restrained the troublemakers.

The woman attempting to record the scene on her phone had her device confiscated.

"Call the police," Hannah instructed Meagan sharply,her stare never leaving the troublemakers.

Turning to the chaotic scene, she raised her voice,making an unwavering declaration to both employees and any potential covert photographers."Take note-our surveillance network captured every instance of slander, defamation, and vandalism! Each detail is recorded.The authorities will be here shortly."

Hannah calmly surveyed the wrecked store, a bold plan forming in her mind.

In parallel, Fontaine Galleria's primary portal released
an official clarification affirming that the collaboration between Fontaine Galleria and Hannah adhered strictly to formal business ethics.

Soon afterward, Claude posted on a social platform."Hannah and I are seriously dating."

At the same time, Vincent escalated the investigation to maximum priority-he demanded that all source IPs tied to the defamatory campaign against Hannah be identified within the day.

As Vincent made ready to leave for Fontaine Galleria,his gaze fell upon Claude's social media post. All his calm vanished-his frame turned rigid instantly. A memory surged-Hannah's voice echoing, "I don't love you anymore." So she had feelings for someone else. She and Claude were already an item...

With a sudden burst, Vincent slammed the tablet onto the desk, producing a heavy, lifeless bang.
###Chapter 271 Fontaine Galleria Will Stand With You


At VelaCore's flagship store, the three troublemakers were still hurling curses, drawing curious stares from the growing crowd.

Hannah turned to Meagan and spoke briskly. "Get the testing center on the line. Have them send a team down here-equipment and all. I want evidence collected on the spot."

"On it," Meagan said, already halfway out the door.

But Hannah stopped her with a sharp gesture."And call the reporters. Tell them we have a scandal worth broadcasting. Invite them to cover the whole thing live-they won't want to miss this."

"Right away." Meagan dashed off, her phone already pressed to her ear.

Hannah faced the three troublemakers, her eyes
glinting coldly. "You keep insisting my company's lingerie is toxic, that it'll ruin someone's skin after a single wear."

She stepped forward, her posture defiant, her voice ringing out for everyone to hear. "I'll prove it right here. I, Hannah Scott, will wear the set myself-publicly, in front of everyone, for a full day. Let's see if you still have the nerve to talk after that."

Gasps rippled through the onlookers, silencing the store.

The store manager stepped forward, his tone measured. "Ms. Scott, is this really wise? Shouldn't we rely on the test report..."

Hannah cut him off, her eyes flashing with resolve."We have to do this. Reports take days. The internet moves in seconds. People's minds are made up before the facts even land. I'm not letting these lies destroy us. I'll clear our name right now, in front of everyone."

Without waiting for a reply, she spun on her heel and
signaled to a staff member nearby. "Fetch a sealed set from the warehouse-the exact style everyone's been gossiping about. The one they've been saying is toxic. We'll unbox it here, for all to see."

The staff member snapped to attention. "Right away!" He hustled out of the warehouse, returning with a fresh, factory-sealed mesh sports bra.

Hannah snatched it from his hands, tearing open the plastic with a practiced flick. She held the spotless lingerie high for everyone to see, her every movement decisive and unflinching.

Her attention then shifted, eyes cutting sharply to the security supervisor who had just appeared by the entrance."Please see to it that those three women take a seat in the lounge area over there.Make sure they stay put until I'm done."

The security supervisor gave a brisk nod and,without missing a beat, ushered the bickering trio over to the designated seats, planting himself nearby with a watchful stance.
The three women's faces darkened in unison, their protests now reduced to tense, furious whispers.

Hannah, without even glancing back, strode to the fitting rooms, clutching the new lingerie in her fist.

The door slammed behind her with a satisfying thud.

Silence swept through the store. Every eye in the crowd locked onto that closed door, breath collectively held, waiting for what would happen next.The three troublemakers went dead silent.

Moments ticked by before Hannah finally reappeared, stepping out with calm, deliberate grace.

She wore the new pale-toned lingerie-no mistakes about it-layered beneath a matching silk cardigan,the store's fluorescent spotlight catching on the delicate fabric.

Gasps and scattered applause filled the air. There was no denying it now. Hannah stood tall, every inch poised and unflinching, right at the center of
attention. The so-called "toxic" lingerie clung to her figure, looking immaculate. She radiated composure,utterly free of any discomfort or allergies the three troublemakers had claimed.

Hannah swept her gaze to the three troublemakers,whose faces had gone ashen. Her eyes glinted,her voice cutting through the din with crystalline authority. "Look closely. I'm standing right here, and I feel perfectly fine."

Reporters surged into the store alongside the testing personnel, their cameras flashing as technicians began taking meticulous samples from the disputed lingerie.

While everyone watched, Hannah faced the cameras with effortless poise, launching into a crisp explanation of VelaCore's design philosophy-her voice ringing with confidence, her presence commanding attention.

Across the room, the three troublemakers shrank into themselves, ducking away from the reporters' lenses,trying in vain to escape the crowd's hostile glare.
Moments later, the police strode in, uniforms pristine and expressions unreadable.

Without missing a beat, Hannah gestured toward the three women under security's watchful eye."Officers, those are the ones you're looking for.They've broadcast blatant lies, savagely defamed my company's products, and stirred up a scene. The testing team has already taken samples-the official report will be ready soon. For the matter of public disorder, please handle it as the law reqquires."

As the police officers prepared to detain the three women, the heavyset woman stalked past Hannah,shooting her a look brimming with venom and spite.

Abruptly, she let out a shrill cry, feigning a stumble as she lurched forward-her movements clumsy yet calculated. She swung her shoulder at Hannah with clear intent, trying to send Hannah sprawling straight into the pool of black liquid that had been spilled earlier.

A voice rang out from the crowd."Careful!"
But Hannah moved with effortless poise,sidestepping at the last second, her every motion controlled and graceful.

The heavyset woman's frame carried her forward,and with a wail that pierced the air, she pitched headlong into the puddle herself, landing with a spectacular, wet thud that echoed through the mall.

Hannah didn't flinch. She stood tall, her lips curled into a calm, confident smile as she turned to the rolling cameras. "I trust everyone saw what just happened. This is exactly what slander looks like."

"No doubt about it." A warm, reassuring voice rose above the murmurs, drawing every gaze.

The crowd instinctively gave way, parting in a wave as a man strode forward. He reached Hannah's side,meeting her eyes with an easy, unshakable smile."Fontaine Galleria will stand with you, Ms. Scott."

Hannah matched Claude's smile and subtly shifted to stand side by side with him.
High above, on the fourth floor, Vincent watched it all unfold. He'd rushed straight from the office, not even pausing for breath. In mere minutes, he'd seen Hannah turn the tide-her composure and fearless energy impossible to miss, blazing in the chaos.His lips, tense and tight since he'd arrived, finally eased into a softer line.

But when Claude materialized at her side, Vincent's jaw clenched, and with a flash of frustration, he tore off his tie.
###Chapter 272 The Most Effective Way To Quell Those Baseless Rumors


Vincent's gaze stayed fixed on Hannah-her expression hinted she hadn't expected Claude's arrival, yet she didn't shy away either.

The pressure in Vincent's fists turned his knuckles pale as stone. Just for a heartbeat, the urge to stride over and yank Hannah from the scene pulsed strongly.

Yet, a lifetime navigating boardrooms had forged in him an eerie composure that masked even the fiercest fury. He touched the concealed earpiece,tone frosty. "Move in. Quietly. No one's to be alerted."

In an instant, members of Vincent's undercover protection detail mobilized with quiet efficiency. Two of them seamlessly joined the on-site officers to assist in maintaining order, ensuring the three
troublemakers had no chance to cause further disturbance.

Simultaneously, another squad assumed unobtrusive control of the cloth specimens' custody-securing the delivery and erasing any chance of interference.

Several others, outfitted to mimic ordinary cleaning staff, began wiping away the strange ebony fluid scattered across the shop floor.

Taking it all in, Hannah figured Claude had been behind the extra help.

The entire maneuver was executed with unflinching accuracy and barely a ripple of interruption.When the lead agent returned with a flat, "Task complete,"Vincent gave a slight inclination of approval. "Good.Pull back."

"Yes."

Throughout this whole incident, Hannah had taken on the livestream solo. From aesthetic vision to garment structure, she spoke with clarity and grace,
drawing the attention of the viewers without missing a beat.

The live stream concluded with the clock ticking past ten at night.

Claude hadn't lingered for long and had already departed, called away by a sudden job demand.

Left to handle closing duties alone, Hannah briefly felt her legs weaken-not just from fatigue, but the emotional weight of the entire ordeal. She steadied herself quickly, keeping her face composed,though Vincent-still watching-caught the moment.

Then, a thick male coat landed around her shoulders,its familiar scent unmistakable.

She stiffened. The coat had come from behind, and she hadn't noticed anyone getting near.

At that same beat, a branded paper bag was gently placed beside her, pristine and white flats tucked inside.

Jolted,she turned fast-only glimpsing a tall man in
dark leisurewear merging swiftly into the crowd.Vincent? When had he arrived?

Suppressing the surprise, she wrapped up the work with the store staff and departed without a word.

Back in her apartment, she let the steaming water of the shower soothe her muscles, easing away the tension bit by bit.

Only afterward did she reach for her mobile device.

Online, the tide had turned. The rumors-about "toxic" lingerie and "her advancing her career with physical appeal"-were now being drowned beneath applause. Users praised her for handling everything with professionalism, calmness, and class.

A gentle but rare pride unfurled within Hannah.

Until a familiar name on the trending headline grabbed her gaze-Claude.

Blinking in surprise, she tapped the headline. Every word hit like a dropped match in dry grass. Claude had publicly declared they were romantically
involved.

More confused than anything, Hannah froze. That wasn't his usual style.

With zero delay, she dialed his number.

The connection was instant.

"Hannah, are you home?" Claude's voice carried a hint of smile.

"| saw your post." Hannah didn't beat around the bush. "Why did you post such a lie?"

There was a brief silence on the other end. When he finally spoke again, his voice had deepened. "The way the netizens said about you... That was too harsh. I couldn't stomach it any longer."

He paused and then added plainly, "I have discussed options with my PR team, and this blunt move is the most effective way to quell those baseless rumors."

His explanation was calm and rational.

Hannah wasn't sure how to respond.
Silence stretched between them.

After a pause, Claude added carefully, "Five years of people calling you a mistress or worse. I've had enough."

During those five years, he'd dedicated himself to chasing the Hobbes succession. At that time, he could only sit by, unable to offer any substantial help to Hannah. But now, the game had shifted. Now,he had the power to shield her from any harm.

The words landed somewhere deep inside Hannah.And just like that, the truth became clear to her.Claude's post was a subtle way of defending her reputation. A public stand against the injustice she'd suffered as Vincent's hidden wife, mislabeled as Vincent's kept woman. Claude was livid on her behalf. And he refused to stay quiet.

Warmth spread through Hannah's chest, slow but steady. She took a breath and softened her tone."Claude,that Chapter's closed."

She paused, her voice firmer this time. "But still-
thank you."

As she resumed browsing the rest of the comments,a sudden thought struck her.
###Chapter 273 No Loose Ends


Hannah couldn'tignore the cost Claude was paying for this "relationship announcement." For a man in his position-his every move dissected by the public -even pretending came with a heavy price. The rumors alone would hound him for weeks, if not months.

A sharp twist of unease ran through her. She softened her tone. "You didn't have to go this far for me. It's really not fairto you." After all, it had pulled him right into the center of a public firestorm-staking his reputation to shield hers.

On the other end, Claude clicked his tongue,his voice teasing. "Come on, think of it as doing me a solid-now l've got an excuse to shake off those unwanted admirers."

He stretched out the words with mock frustration."You have no idea how many women keep trying
their luck. It's really annoying. Now they'll finally back off." After all, not just anyone could compare to Hannah.

Hearing Claude joke like this again, Hannah was swept back to their childhood days, nostalgia curling around her like a warm breeze. A soft, unguarded laugh escaped her lips-unexpected, lifting the weight of the past days in one breath.

Claude caught the sound instantly, his tone turning brighter, almost relieved. "You've really been through the wringer lately."

The glowing headline on her screen still blared her name. Determination flickered in her eyes. "If things turn out right, that's all I care about."

She fixed her gaze on the screen, voice measured and fierce. "Claude, I've got a new strategy."

Energy crackled in her voice as she reveled in the surge of momentum, eyes glued to the analytics screen where the numbers soared higher with each passing second.
Across town, sunlight spilled over the opulent apartment.

Erica had just hurled a crystal ornament against the wall, exploding into glittering shards.

Reflected in the cold bolue glow of her screen, a tidal wave of praise for Hannah's livestream swept across the internet. The very smear campaign she'd engineered-meant to derail Hannah's new brand-had been completely overpowered by a forceful counterwave.

A bitter sneer twisted Erica's lips. "What a bunch of incompetents!" she snapped, voice chillingly even."Can't even pull off a basic job."

The so-called professionals she'd paid to sabotage Hannah hadn't just failed-they'd handed that bitch an opportunity to ride the chaos straight to ev/en greater popularity.

Sure, Erica had caught the trending headline of the
relationship announcement linking Claude and Hannah. She'd scrolled through that post over and over,picking apart every carefully chosen word in the caption that had now gone viral.

A sly scoff escaped her as she dragged a fingertip across Claude's image, eyes narrowing. "So that slut really clawed her way up and snagged the Hobbes family's golden boy,huh?"

Still, a nagging question gnawed at her-why hadn't Vincent made a move? Did he not care about Hannah anymore? It made sense. They were already divorced. They had no right to meddle in each other's affairs anymore.

"Great. If she's with Claude now, maybe she'll finally leave Vincent alone." A faint, calculating smile curved Erica's lips.

Despite the years she'd spent away, she'd never stopped bracing herself as Vincent's future wife.Years of her life had vanished into endless etiquette lessons, business textbooks, and a meticulous catalog of Vincent's every like and quirk.
More than that, she'd quietly funneled money through a string of shadowy factories-places that never saw a profit because their real purpose was to launder cash and provide safe havens for covert meetings with "friends" best left unnamed. Basked in Sharon's generous funding, she'd kept her sprawling spy network humming and indulged in opulent comforts.

All of it fueled a singular obsession-she dreamed that one day, she could step into the spotlight beside Vincent, not as a shadow, but as his rightful wife.

Now,Hannah-her most persistent rival-had been neatly sidelined, cut out of the running in a way even she hadn't anticipated. As Claude's girlfriend,Hannah would finally keepo to her place.

Days of bitter envy and buried resentment at last found a crack to seep through, and Erica let it surface, icy and triumphant.

Claude's relationship with Hannah had erased any hope of Hannah ever crawling back to Vincent-exactly the outcome Erica needed.
With her biggest rival out of the way, Erica figured she finally stood on the threshold of everything she'd schemed for-the title of Mrs. Jones. And she couldn't afford to leave a single loose end. Those three useless pawns? She couldn't risk them running their mouths.

A new chill crept into her gaze, one that glittered with icy, lethal intent. She plucked a burner phone from her desk drawer, her fingers moving with unhurried precision, and dialed a number unlisted in any contacts.

The line connected almost instantly-one of her so-called "friends" at the factory.

The call was picked up almost instantly.

"They've been caught. Take care of them-no loose ends," Erica murmured, her voice silk-smooth and terrifyingly serene.

On the other end, there was a pause before a cold,professional reply came. "Understood. In a place like prison, it's easy enough to make accidents happen."
She ended the call and set the phone aside with a flick of her wrist. The sharp clap of her hands sliced through the quiet. From the shadows of the bedroom, a man in a blindfold emerged, obedient and silent.

Without hesitation, Erica settled into his lap, her movements unhurried and intimate. Leaning close,she traced his jaw with her fingertip and whispered,"Vincent, kiss me."

###Chapter 274 Congratulations


The man's real name was Logan Grant. But to Erica,he was only ever "Vincent." That was the name she insisted on-nothing else would do. He'd been handpicked, molded, and conditioned into the perfect step-in of Vincent for her.

When Erica whispered, "Kiss me," Logan responded instantly, bending toward her with practiced submission and just the slightest flicker of desperation, sealing his lips to hers.

His mouth felt cold. Every movement was a flawless imitation, refined by endless rehearsals to match exactly how Erica believed Vincent should kiss-steady, commanding, with a cool reserve beneath the surface.

Erica let her eyelids flutter closed, melting into the kiss. A soft sound of pleasure escaped her, her body yielding to the moment.
But then, Logan's throat moved, and he murmured her name in a low voice, "Erica..."

"Hush!" she snapped, eyes flying open and snuffing out all warmth in a heartbeat.

Her nail pressed sharply against his lips, biting into the flesh as a warning. "Quiet. Don't say a word," she hissed, her tone as chilling as ice. "The second you start talking, you're not him anymore."

Surgery had already given Logan Vincent's face-an eerie likeness, except for the eyes. This was why she always made him wear the blindfold.

Logan stiffened, all desire draining away, leaving behind nothing but raw fear and obedience. He swallowed hard, smothering both the urge to speak and every last shred of the real Logan Grant.

Sensing his renewed obedience, Erica's hunger returned, wild and blazing, satisfaction and madness tangled together.

She seized his face and kissed him again, this time
rougher, nearly savage.

When she finally pulled away, her breathing was ragged, her cheeks flushed with feverish excitement."I'm in a good mood today," she murmured, voice trembling with manic delight. "Let's do it right here."

She was more than ready to savor her own private Vincent Jones.



A few days later, the long-awaited report of Hannah's company's lingerie-commissioned from a top-tier agency-finally dropped.

The verdict was crystal clear: the products not only passed every national safety standard, but they outperformed sev/eral brands within the same market on several key measures. The "toxic lingerie" scandal was exposed as nothing more than a baseless,spiteful attack.

That same day, Hannah uploaded the full report to her company's official account and her personal one,
pinning it to the top.
The post set off another surge of online chatter.

Without wasting a minute, Hannah printed out the report and headed straight to the police station. She pressed for updates on the three women who had stirred things up. Their appearance had coincided too perfectly with the smear campaign-someone had clearly orchestrated it. If she could get them to talk, maybe she'd finally find out who was really pulling the strings. And that mysterious fire from before? Was it somehow connected too?

But the officer's response was a gut punch. "Ms.Scott, I'm sorry to tell you this, but two days ago,those three women got into a violent brawl while detained. By the time we intervened, all of them had suffered critical injuries. None of them made it."

"A fight? All three of them?" Hannah's voice was tight with disbelief. "No warning signs? No evidence of anyone else involved?"

She couldn't accept it. Was the whole lead gone just
like that?

The officer let out a tired sigh. "Everything we've collected, from the scene itself to the statements from their cellmates, points to ongoing grudges among those three women. Things spiraled and ended in tragedy. There's no solid proof anyone else was involved. Admittedly, it feels a little too neat. Still,we're closing the file as a mutual assault that turned fatal."

Hannah let out a low, bitter sigh. "How convenient."

This wasn't some random tragedy. It was a clean sweep-a calculated erasure, done with chilling precision.

A storm of frustration and despair churned inside her. She'd been on the verge of real answers, and now everything had gone cold.

Hannah turned to go, but barely made it down the hall before her eyes landed-almost by accident-on a familiar silhouette in the waiting area, stopping her in her tracks.
He stood there with his back to her, voice low as he spoke with an officer. The precise cut of his black coat emphasized the strength in his framne, giving off a subtle but unmistakable authority, even from behind.

She wondered why Vincent was here.

Almost as if he sensed her staring, Vincent wrapped up his conversation. The officer nodded respectfully and stepped away.

Vincent turned around, and his eyes locked onto hers from across the room.

For a moment, neither of them moved. The silence thickened.

In the end, it was Hannah who broke the silence.She drew a steady breath and closed the distance,halting just a single step in front of him. "Mr. Jones, I never got to thank you for the other day," she said,her voice steady but marked by a gentle formality.She meant the shoes and the coat he'd sent her.
Vincent's eyes lingered on her face for a moment before his usual stoic expression returned. There was the faintest curve at the corner of his lips-barely there. "Don't mention it. I didn't do much," he replied,voice cool and distant.

Without pause, he shifted gears. "Claude's always liked the direct route." He hesitated for only a beat.Then, in a voice stiff with formality, he added,"Congratulations."

A single word, uttered with a rigid, almost ceremonial formality.
###Chapter 275 Let's Forget It Ever Happened


Hannah dismissed the implication, interpreting Vincent's remark as a casual nod to how seamlessly she'd navigated the fallout. Holding his stare without a trace of faltering, she flashed a polished,boardroom-perfect smile. "Appreciate it. The drama slashed my advertising costs."

To Vincent, the way she said it said everything. So,it was true-she was indeed seeing Claude now... His eyes dimmed ever so slightly.

Hannah was just about to brush past him when Vincent's voice cut in, steady and low. "Regarding your question that evening..."

A brief flutter shot through Hannah's chest. That night, overwhelmed by a tangle of realizations and emotional weight, she had said something wild -"You've fallen in love with me." Now, that careless
remark hung around her like a chain-something she wished she could erase.

Despite her inward fluster, she didn't recoil. Instead,she raised her chin and stared back at Vincent, eyes steady. Her voice held steady, not rising or dipping."At that time, it was too late. I wasn't in the right headspace.Whatever I babbled-it means nothing."

She paused, studying the unreadable depths of his gaze, and then curved her lips into a faint,professional smirk. "Just a meaningless blurt. Let's forget it ever happened."

Without waiting for his response-or even glancing to see how he reacted-she nodded slightly, the way one might acknowledge a polite stranger before leaving. "I won't take up any more of your time. I have another engagement.Excuse me."

Vincent stood in place, watching her retreating figure, his eyes unreadable. The more she tried to brush it off, the sharper her words from that night echoed-so sharp that they lacerated. And seared.And now, she was seeing someone else...
Irritated, he yanked at his collar, loosening the first button.



After the chaos died down, Hannah wasted no time harnessing the tidal wave of buzz triggered by the report's release. At the company's meeting, she delivered a shocker.

"We're ditching the expected route." Her tone climbed with energy, lined with daring boldness."We're launching an all-out lingerie extravaganza-one designed to alter how women's undergarments are seen. I'm naming it... Metamorphosis."

She remained standing at the front of the room, gaze unwavering as she addressed the team, "The report has stabilized things for now, but audiences forget,and buzz dies fast. We just got a blast of unmatched visibility-under terrible timing. That, ironically,makes it golden."

Heads bobbed in cautious agreement, but Douglas Blake, the man in charge of risk and compliance,
raised his voice. "Ms. Scott, this is reckless. You're wagering everything we've got! A lingerie show? We only just scraped off the 'hazardous product' label,and now you're leading us into something this incendiary? Folks will see nothing but a stunt-cheap and desperate."

Hannah's gaze sharpened as it cut to Douglas. Her words were sharp and unshaken. "Mr. Blake, risk management isn't about talk. Right now, you don't even have a report backing your claim. Your objections carry no weight."

She stood tall, palms anchored to the table, her presence commanding. "Caution at this point doesn't eliminate risk and still reeks of guilt. What I want is to ride this wave and rise. And as for the controversy over a lingerie show..."

Her lips twitched into a razor-thin smirk, radiating absolute control. "Let them talk. I'm here to upend this field."

Douglas flushed with indignation and slammed his hand on the table. "If Mr. Wade were still around,
he'd never sign off on something this reckless. You pushed him to that remote international assignment -do you honestly believe he wanted to go?"

Hannah slammed a folder onto the table.

The sharp thud silenced the room.

She stared Douglas down without flinching, her voice rising. "Felix's redeployment was an executive decision-and completely within my jurisdiction.You're in charge of risk and compliance, and act like one. Ten minutes. I want a first draft of an emergency mitigation plan on my desk. Bring answers. Not whining. Not speculation."

Her voice sank into ice. "And if you can't deliver, then step down. I don't keep dead weight on my team."

The tension in the room turned crushing.

Without casting anyone a look, Hannah declared her decision, "Seven days from now, the Metamorphosis lingerie showcase will premiere at the Verris Contemporary Arts Hall. Alice Dubois will beour
closing model. I'll secure her myself. That's final."

As Hannah left the room with measured steps, a voice murmured, "Isn't Alice almost impossible to sign? Think Ms. Scott can actually land her?"
###Chapter 276 A Visit To Jones Group


The moment Hannah announced the Metamorphosis lingerie show, the internet erupted.

Across forums and social media, audiences split into two sharply divided camps.

Some female users cheered with excitement, while others rolled their eyes, accusing Hannah of "stirring up drama right after clearing her name."

Meanwhile, in Vincent's office, a real-time media analytics report on the Metamorphosis show scrolled steadily across the expansive screen.

Vincent's sharp gaze swept over jarring phrases like "desperate stunt" and "cheap publicity," though his expression gave nothing away.

Derek stood silently nearby.

"The buzz is intense," Vincent remarked in a low
unreadable tone.

His eyes paused at a single, easily overlooked line near the bottom of the report: "Final headliner rumored to be international supermodel Alice Dubois.Not yet confirmed."

Looking up, his voice calm but commanding, he said "Check Alice Dubois's public itinerary for the next month. I want to know if anything overlaps with Hannah's."

"On it," Derek responded and then exited swiftly and without a word more.



Hannah hadn't anticipated her conversation with Alice to unfold so seamlessly.

Alice had been visibly moved-both by Hannah's authenticity and by the bold, empowering vision behind Metamorphosis. The custom storyline, The Queen of Metamorphosis, struck a personal chord with her desire for true self-expression.
"Ms. Scott," Alice said, taking a sip of coffee, her eyes gleaming with excitement. "Metamorphosis isn't just a fashion show-it's a statement. I'm obsessed.It actually gave me goosebumps. I'm in."

Overjoyed, Hannah immediately instructed her legal team to draft the most favorable contract terms possible. The very next day, she hand-delivered the final documents to the luxury suite where Alice and her agent were staying.

Hannah was already brimming with ideas for the headline announcement that would set the internet ablaze. But the moment she stepped into the suite,she sensed a shift in atmosphere.

Alice still looked radiant, her smile warm, her demeanor kind-but when Hannah handed over the contract and pen, a faint hesitation shadowed her features.

"I'm so sorry, Ms. Scott..." Alice said softly, her lips tightening as she exchanged a glance with her agent.

Her agent, Vicki Langford, stepped forward with a
smooth, professional expression. "Ms. Scott, I'm afraid we won't be able to sign today. Something unexpected came up last night. Alice just finalized an exclusive endorsement deal with another major brand. For the time being, all her commercial appearances and image usage must be cleared by that company first."

Vicki offered a diplomatic smile. "So for now, she won't be able to sign this personal runway contract."

The fire inside Hannah cooled in an instant. Still, not the slightest hint of surprise or frustration flickered on her face. Her expression merely sharpened, calm and composed, as she closed the contract.

"I see," Hannah replied evenly, voice steady and deliberate. Her gaze fixed on Alice. "Then what we'll need next is a formal authorization from your new agency."

Alice's regret was evident. She offered a sincere apology. "Ms. Scott, I really do love your show-the concept is brilliant. But I can't violate the terms. The contract | signed has very strict exclusivity clauses."
Lowering her voice slightly, she added, "Their legal team plays hardball. But... maybe if you reached out to my new employer directly, there could still be room for discussion."

"Which company?" Hannah asked.

"Jones Group," Vicki answered without missing a beat.

Hannah went still. She hadIn't seen that coming.

Later that day, Hannah arrived at the Jones Group headquarters-alone. The private elevator carried her straight to the executive floor.

As though anticipating her arrival, Derek was already waiting. He greeted her politely, then led her to the office door and gave a soft knock.

"Come in," came the low, familiar voice from inside.

Hannah stepped in.

Vincent sat at his desk, casually flipping through paperwork, every movement measured and
composed.Only when he heard her footsteps did he look up. Those deep, unreadable eyes met hers, calm and deliberate.

"Ms. Scott. What a surprise," he said slowly, his tone low and edged with lazy amusement. "Is this about Alice?"
###Chapter 277 Spend A Month With Me


Hannah didn't jump straight into the deal. She opened with a question of her own. "Signing Alice Dubois-was that something you decided on the spot,Mr.Jones?"

That move had blindsided her, coming just hours before she was set to ink their partnership. The timing reeked of calculation.

Vincent relaxed into the leather of his chair, fingertips laced in a posture of effortless confidence. His expression gave nothing away; he radiated the unflappable composure of someone who treated business like a high-stakes chess match.

"Jones Group's new premium skincare brand demands a spokesperson who stands out-someone with a rare, global allure," he answered in a measured, unhurried voice. "Alice fits those requirements. Her market influence is undeniable.
The decision to bring her on was purely strategic-a move that benefits both sides. Nothing more, nothing less."

His delivery was crisp, almost clinical, as if reading from a script.

Hannah scrutinized him, searching for any hint of emotion, but Vincent's face stayed as inscrutable as ever, as though bringing Alice on board had been just another tick on the corporate checklist.

Her hands tensed at her sides before she drew in a breath and offered him a meaningful smile. "You make a good point, Mr. Jones. Alice is the kind of talent any brand would scramble to sign." She paused, letting her words linger between them."But the timing was extraordinary. Almost too precise. I have to admit, I'm impressed by how quickly the word must have traveled. Practically the moment she and I reached an agreement, your team swept in and closed the deal-like clockwork."

Hannah's tone stayed gentle, but the subtle steel beneath it was unmistakable. "Honestly, the whole
thing felt so perfectly choreographed that, for a second, I thought you'd orchestrated it just to get under my skin."

A subtle shift rippled through Vincent's posture; he leaned forward ever so slightly, interest sharpening his gaze. Instead of bristling, he remained composed, his fingers drumming an absent rhythm against the gleaming surface of his desk.

"So, you think I engineered all this just to rattle you,Ms. Scott?" His reply came with effortless poise. "My company's search for a spokesperson began long before your negotiations. Alice earned her spot after we evaluated every option. The decision to sign her stemmed from hard-nosed corporate reasoning. And as for this allegedly precise timing..."

A faint smile touched his lips. "Maybe the real issue is that details about your schedule travel faster than you'd expect, Ms. Scott."

His words ricocheted the blame back at her,transforming her suspicion into a flaw of her own overexposure.
A knot formed in Hannah's chest. He always had this way-building an impenetrable fortress out of cold logic and razor-sharp phrasing. She could never crack his facade.

Determined to stop dancing around the point,Hannah locked eyes with him, her patience fraying."So you're saying Alice's contract has absolutely nothing to do with Metamorphosis-my lingerie show?"

Vincent didn't answer her question. Instead,he stood slowly and strolled around the edge of his oversized mahogany desk, every step he took radiated an unspoken power, compressing the air until it thrummed with tension.

He halted just short of her, close enough for his shadow to eclipse hers.

In an instant, she was swallowed by his nearness-his clean, cool scent, the impenetrable wall of his presence, the magnetic pull that seemed to bend the very space between them.
Their height difference forced Hannah to tip her chin,meeting his eyes where they lingered just above her.

"You're asking if it was intentional?" His voice,pitched low and velvety, slid between them like a secret-intimate as a caress, yet edged with a chill that made her skin prickle.

He leaned even closer, and she could trace the sharp plane of his collarbone beneath his shirt.

His breath teased a stray lock at her temple, trapping her in a hush so dense that it felt suffocating.

Unblinking, Hannah stared back, refusing to look away. "That's right. I want a real answer. lf..."

Vincent silenced her with a level, implacable voice."Yes. I did it on purpose."

Every trace of pretense vanished. There hadn't been
a flicker of remorse on his face. His company had stuck to the rulebook-right up until he'd seen her schedule. Then, without hesitation, he'd advanced
the signing by two full weeks.
"You..." Hannah's breath stuttered, her chest tightening. For a split second, her composure cracked as shock widened her eyes. She'd braced herself for negotiations, manipulations, even covert sabotage-but not for such bald, unapologetic honesty.

"Why?" Her voice wavered, rough and frayed at the edges. She fought to keep herself steady. "To humiliate me? Is that it? Did you want to watch me stumble-just for your own satisfaction? Vincent, this isn't your style."

He answered with a thin, icy smile-one that pressed down on the room like a tightening vise. Rather than pulling away, he angled closer, his presence looming over her, every inch of his frame radiating deliberate pressure.

"Why?" He repeated her question, the word rolling off his tongue, laced with a mocking amusement that didn't reach his eyes. "It's far simpler than you imagine.I simply wanted to find out..."
He raised his hand-not to touch, but to hover with calculated intent, pausing directly above her heart. "I wanted to see what you'd give up for your precious little lingerie show."

She didn't flinch. Her eyes met his, steel-sharp and steady,the old composure snapping back into place.
"Let's not beat around the bush, Mr. Jones." Her tone turned pointed, the edge of a negotiator returning."Name your terms. How much for Alice's authorization to show up in my company's event?"

A low, rich laugh rolled from Vincent's lips. He let the silence stretch and then replied, voice steely and unyielding, "It's easy." He leaned in, his words slipping into her ear like a dare. "You spend a month with me.Day and night. No distance."
###Chapter 278 All Just To Confirm Your Own Feelings


Vincent's words hit like a strike of iron, and Hannah's eyes widened instantly. "Absolutely not!" she snapped without the slightest pause.

She drew her sharpest weapon without hesitation."Mr. Jones, have you forgotten? I'm currently Claude's officially acknowledged girlfriend. You make a request like that-so blatantly-aren't you worried the Jones Group will be plastered across every financial headline by morning, dragging your stock price down with the scandal?"

A flash of ice-cold anger flickered through Vincent's eyes. But instead of backing off, he suddenly leaned forward, planting both hands firmly on the desk,bracketing her in.

His presence surged over her-intense,commanding, and inescapably dominant. "I don't
give a damn," he hissed, voice low and simmering with control on the edge of a storm.

Their faces were just inches apart. His breath grazed her forehead; their exhales collided in a tightly wound current. "You think I give a damn what tomorrow's headlines say?" he added.

Hannah's spine met the edge of the desk with a sharp jolt. Every nerve in her body was on high alert.Before she could stop herself, the words tumbled out. "Vincent, are you trying to make me your hidden lover again?"

The question landed like a blade drawn clean.

"No," he shot back-fast, sharp,absolute.

But then, with a slow curve of his lips, he added,"If that's your concern, I can announce you as my girlfriend right now. That way, no one will ever call you a hidden lover."

His gaze was unflinching, every word deliberate and weighted. "But answer me honestly-are you willing
to break up with Claude this instant?"
The challenge struck like thunder, splitting the fraught silence. Hannah's breath stuttered, anger snuffed out in a heartbeat. That was when she felt it -a flash of unmistakable jealousy. The realization sliced through the haze in her mind, lightning-fast and bright. All at once, every odd behavior and the "coincidence" made perfect sense.

The fury faded from her eyes, replaced by a glint of clarity-and unmistakable amusement. Rather than retreat, she let out a soft, knowing laugh and stepped closer. "So that's what all this is really about.Vincent, are you seriously jealous and still pretending you're not?"

Her words teased and challenged him, edged and light at the same time.

Vincent's reaction was instinctive. His voice snapped out, cold and defensive,"I am not jealous."

He denied it with such haste that it only made his inner turmoil more obvious.
"Not jealous?" Hannah echoed, her voice rising,slicing through the distance. Her eyes flashed as she closed in, driving Vincent backwards-until he hit the wall,trapped.

They were close enough to feel every unsteady breath between them.

She locked onto his eyes-eyes that instinctively flickered away before trying to regain composure-and fired off a barrage of pointed questions. "NJot jealous? Then why do you care so much about Claude being my boyfriend? Why are you so intent on making me cut him off? And why are you so desperate to keep me,your ex-wife, by your side?"

Each word landed hard.

Vincent stood immobilized, caught in her crosshairs.His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed. "I just needed to be sure."

"Sure?" Hannah arched a brow, leaning closer. "Sure of what,exactly?"
"Sure of what you said that night," Vincent replied instantly, eyes fixed on her face, now just inches away.

Hannah's gaze sharpened, everything clicking into place. She remembered that night in his hospital room-her hand on his chest, her voice cutting and merciless as she'd declared, "You've fallen in love with me." And now, this precise, self-controlled man had orchestrated everything-every scheme, every thread pulled-just to keep her near. All for what? To confirm his feelings?

Her voice dropped, edged with incredulity. "So you went to all this trouble-set the whole stage,cornered me, pushed me to break up with Claude-"She stepped in, eyes unyielding. "All just to make sure you really loved me?"

His jaw locked, his gaze darkening with the storm brewing inside. "It's the most effective way. If you stay by my side for a month, I'll-"

"You're wrong, Mr. Jones." Hannah cut him off, her voice ringing clear, unwavering. "This is not the most
###Chapter 279 Let's Do That Again


"I've got a faster method," Hannah said, lifting a brow with smooth certainty.

Vincent's stare paused for a moment, his eyes flickering with something unreadable as he stared directly back at her.

A quiet, confident smirk curled faintly at Hannah's mouth's edge.

She dropped her gaze and then promptly retrieved her phone from the polished handbag resting beside her.With a brisk motion, she tapped a contact.The name appeared. Claude.

Vincent's jaw tightened.

Without hesitation, she activated speaker mode right in front of Vincent.

"Hannah." Claude's recognizable voice came through
the line.

"Claude?" Her cadence was steady and formal."Hope I'm not intruding. I've just wrapped the project review and wanted to pitch some thoughts your way."

She purposely avoided glancing at Vincent, ignoring the heated tension swelling beside her.

Claude's resonant voice came through with its usual authority and calm. "Trouble with the project?"

"For the finale, I'm thinking of scrapping the traditional fixed runway poses. What do you think?"Hannah responded crisply. "The snag is, the motion-responsive lighting needs high-end technical backing, and our syncing with the vendor remains rocky. It's been giving me a bit of a headache."

"Then don't push it. I'll swing by after your shift."After a slight pause, he added, his voice laced with a trace of inquiry, "Your parents are out this evening.How about a date between you and me?"

That one word-date-caught Hannah slightly off
guard. A flash of surprise sparked in her gaze. After merely a few exchanges, he'd delivered exactly the cue she wanted. She turned to meet Vincent's gaze,locking onto his reaction.

Date. That word struck Vincent like a blade. He wouldn't allow it.

The frustration inside Vincent's chest exploded in an instant. He moved fast-one long stride brought him right in front of her. No pause. No warning. Hannah didn't get the chance to dodge.

Both his hands cupped her face tightly, fingers pressing into the softness of her cheeks, blocking any chance for her to turn away.

And then, his head dipped down, and his mouth crashed onto hers with razor precision.

"Mmph-" Her startled gasp was smothered beneath the force of his kiss.

Her phone remained clenched tightly in her grasp.The call was still active on speaker.
Claude's voice continued casually, "Feeling any cravings? What sounds good for dinner?"

And in the backdrop of that question, the office filled with obscene, unmistakably intimate noises-tongues tangling, lips squelching, teeth grazing.

Hannah's muffled protests escaped in soft gasps,her breath snagged in her throat.

Vincent's breathing turned hoarse and ragged, every exhale steeped in dominating anger.

Each movement-every moan, every exhalation-was caught by the phone and delivered straight to Claude.

On the other end, silence settled in.

The realization hit Hannah. The call hadn't ended. As her fingers reached out to terminate it, Vincent noticed. He didn't like her wandering focus. The fact that her attention was still partially on Claude sharpened the menace in his features.

In one fluid motion, Vincent cupped her face tighter
and yanked the phone from her grasp with his other hand,tossing it away.

The screen landed face-up. The speaker was still on.The call hadn't ended.

"Let him hear this." Before the last syllable left his lips, Vincent dove in again, mouth crashing harder onto hers with ruthless hunger.

The kiss turned savage. Their mouths collided, teeth scraping, the faint taste of blood joining the mix.Sloppy, wet, ravenous noises echoed throughout the office-each one crystal clear through the microphone.

Claude heard every sound. Hannah was with Vincent.And he was kissing her?

Claude's grip tightened around his device. Without another comment, he stood and immediately headed for the Jones Group.

Back in the office, ragged gasps and slick, vulgar smacks of mouth on mouth still lingered in the
charged air.

"Enough!" Snapping out of the haze, Hannah tried to shove Vincent away with all her strength.

His hold eased just a fraction, allowing their lips to part enough for ragged air to rush in. Their panting collided between them.

Her chest rose and fell rapidly. Crimson bloomed across her face from oxygen deprivation. She wiped her lips roughly with her thumb. "Vincent, I believe your feelings are clear now."

She jabbed a finger toward him, tone clipped and pointed. "You're jealous. You kissed me. That confirms it-it didn't take thirty days at all."

Vincent stood there, breathing hard, gaze locked on her.

Hannah gathered her breath. Her stare regained that lethal sharpness she brought into every pitch meeting, like nothing had just happened. "So, Mr.Jones," she said coolly, "when exactly will you keep
###Chapter 280 Don't Keep Giving Her A Hard Time


"What?" Hannah blurted, startled.

"| didn't feel it clearly enough just now," Vincent replied, his gaze fixed on her lips, eyes dark with a desire that bordered on possessiveness. It was clear he wanted another kiss-something deeper to make up for the one that had ended too soon.

"Vincent, you-" Hannah started, her alarm and frustration showing in her wide eyes.

Before she could finish, he was already leaning in again-

"Mr. Jones, your grandmother's here," Derek called out from outside, his voice followed by a sharp knock at the door.

At this point, Vincent's lips were just a breath away from hers.
Acting on pure reflex, Hannah pushed hard against his chest, forcing him back with all her strength.

Bang! Someone knocked heavily on the office door from outside.

In that split second, Hannah glanced at Vincent and spotted it-a bold swipe of lipstick right at the edge of his lips. Oh no! There was no time to think as her body moved on its own.

As Vincent wavered from the shove, an annoyed crease forming between his brows, Hannah reached up abruptly and scrubbed the color from his lips with the back of her hand.

Her touch was quick and rough, enough to make Vincent flinch, brow furrowing.

A heartbeat later, the office door swung wide.

Sharon entered, supporting herself with à cane. She was dressed in animpeccable Chanel suit, her silver hair swept back into a flawless bun. She hadn't even stepped fully inside when her voice, edged with
worry, floated in from the doorway. "Vincent, I've been searching everywhere for you and-"

She stopped short, eyes sweeping the room and landing on an unexpected scene. "Hannah?" Her expression flipped instantly from concern to delighted surprise, whatever she'd planned to say lost in the moment.

Hannah quickly patted her hair into place and offered a warm smile. "Sharon, it's been a while."

She moved in for a hug.

Sharon clung to Hannah and then pulled back,searching Hannah's face as if committing every detail to memory, her gaze lingering especially on Hannah's eyes. There was a tremble of worry in her words. "Your eyes... Have they really healed? No more trouble at all?"

Sharon reached out, hand hovering in midair, hesitant to touch as though afraid of breaking something precious.
The gentle concern made Hannah's heart swell. She nodded softly, voice steady and comforting. "Yes,they're perfect now." Just to ease Sharon's nerves,she even flashed a playful wink.

"That's such a blessing, truly," Sharon whispered,eyes shining as a genuine smile spread across her lips. She kept nodding, emotion thick in her voice."You've been through so much, sweetheart. But now you're whole again-and that's all I care about."

Her hand rested lightly on Hannah's, the gesture overflowing with affection.

Then, remembering Vincent's presence, Sharon's sharp eyes flicked to him, instantly picking up on the strange current in the room and adjusting her expression accordingly. Her smile dimmed a touch,replaced by a spark of playful suspicion as her eyes flicked between the two of them. In a gentle, teasing voice, she asked, "What exactly were you two..."

"Nothing happened." Hannah was quick to shake her head, her denial sharp and absolute.
Vincent's gaze shifted back to Hannah, deep and mysterious.

Hannah's tone shifted instantly back to businesslike coolness. "Sharon, I just stopped by because l needed his signature on a document. That's it."

"I see." Sharon's warm smile returned, eyes twinkling as she nodded along.

But then her tone shifted, laced with the quiet authority of an elder, and directed squarely at Vincent-like a subtle reprimand. "Since Hannah came to you on business, you should treat her with the respect she deserves. Don't keep giving her a hard time."

Vincent didn't reply right away, his body tense. After a long pause, he finally answered, his voice low and a little reluctant, "Alright."

Only then did Sharon seem to remember why she'd come. The smile faded, concern taking its place."Vincent, I actually came because of Erica. She's disappeared. It's been days since she got back to the
family estate, and she hasn't replied to any of my calls or messages. She doesn't really have close friends, either... I can't shake this terrible feeling. Do you think something's happened to her?"
###Chapter 281 She Absolutely Is Not Family

Concern flickered across Sharon's features. "Has Erica come to the company to see you lately?"

Vincent pivoted, his movements deliberate and unhurried.Instead of looking at Sharon, he swept a glacial glance toward Derek.

Derek, standing in the corner, understood the cue and stepped forward slightly, bowing slightly as he reported in a clear and steady voice, "Mr. Jones, Ms. Jones-Ms. Stanton hasn't appeared at the company these last few days."

The efficient reply shut down any further inquiry Sharon might have pressed.

Vincent turned his attention to the city skyline out of the window, his expression unreadable. "I'll have someone track her down."

He pulled out his phone from his pocket and, after a brief pause, dialed. His words were clipped and cold. "Find Erica Stanton's whereabouts. Immediately."

Sharon exhaled, shoulders loosening, though the lines of worry didn't leave her face. She found herself pleading again for Erica's sake. "Vincent, I realize you're still angry about what happened in the study, but Erica... She grew up alone, with no one to rely on, and she's been drifting ever since. She acts impulsively sometimes, but it all comes from that loneliness-she never means any real harm. Please don't hold it against her.When you track her down, just try not to be so harsh."

Vincent's grip on his phone turned white-knuckled, and the corners of his mouth lifted in a faint, wintry smile.He simply
corners of his mouth lifted in a faint, wintry smile. He simply replied, his tone clipped and distant, "Fine."

Sharon's heart sank at his chilly response. After a beat, she recalled something else, her voice suddenly sharper, tinged with gentle accusation. "And you-no matter how buried you are in work, you still have to come home. Back when you and Hannah were still married, I told you again and again: visit the family estate at least once a week. If I hadn't been so anxious about Erica today-and decided to corner you here at the office-would you have even remembered me?"

Vincent finally turned away from the window, his gaze settling on Sharon. His eyes lost a bit of their chill, but his voice stayed steady. "It's not like that."

Sharon glanced at him, let out a weary sigh, and for a moment,couldn't find the words to continue.

The silence lingered, a thin thread of tension in the air, until Hannah-who had quietly observed the exchange-chose her moment. She stepped forward briskly, pulled a contract from her briefcase, and set it on the table with practiced efficiency.

"I've brought the authorization documents, Mr. Jones. Would you mind signing now?" Hannah's smile was poised and professional, her tone ringing with crisp assurance.

Vincent's attention drifted from Sharon to the document, then up to Hannah's composed expression. His lips pressed into a faint line, but instead of reaching for the papers, he spoke coolly. "Just leave it on the table."

His posture clearly indicated a desire to delay.

Hannah didn't waver. Her pleasant smile remained,though her voice turned unmistakably firm. "Mr. Jones, I'm on a tight schedule." She leaned in, her fingers drumming softly against the contract, adding just enough pressure to hint at urgency.

Vincent leaned forward, folding his hands atop the table, his
Vincent leaned forward, folding his hands atop the table, his gaze trailing over the contract. "A contract of this magnitude -one that impacts the entire Jones Group-deserves a line-by -line review, wouldn't you agree, Ms. Scott?"

He lingered on "Ms. Scott," making each syllable ring out with deliberate weight, an unspoken provocation hanging in the air.

The edge in his tone wiped the composure from Hannah's face for a split second, leaving her momentarily adrift, scrambling for a stronger retort.

Before she could rally, Sharon, who had been silently watching with concern etching deeper into her brow, finally stepped forward.

"For heaven's sake, Vincent!" Sharon stepped forward, her patience worn thin. She fixed him with a pointed stare. "It's just a contract. Must you make everything such an ordeal? You're the CEO-are you telling me you can't trust Hannah's judgment? She's always been meticulous,you know that better than anyone. You used to..."

Sharon halted mid-sentence, visibly recalling that Hannah was no longer Vincent's wife, but she pressed on, her irritation barely concealed. "I don't care about all that. You need to sign it right now! Hannah is..."

She shot a quick look at Hannah, doubling down. "She's as good as family to us!"

Something about Sharon's insistence seemed to soften Vincent's mood; his fingertips drummed once on the table.

A tense silence stretched between them before Vincent finally reached for the pen.

Just then, the imposing mahogany door creaked open. Claude entered with deliberate ease, his eyes flickering with warning as he strode toward Hannah. He addressed Sharon in a cold,measured tone, "Ma'am, I think you're mistaken. Anna and
measured tone, "Ma'am, I think you're mistaken. Anna and Vincent have been divorced for quite some time. She absolutely is not family to you anymore."
###Chapter 282 I'd Marry Her Tomorrow

The receptionist looked as though all the color had drained from her face. She followed Claude in a flustered panic, her voice trembling on the edge of tears. "I-I'm so sorry, Mr. Jones!I tried to stop him, but I just couldn't..."

Vincent's glare was frigid. His left hand, resting on the chair's arm, tightened-just barely, but enough to make his knuckles stand out stark white.

Derek, quietly observing from the sidelines, caught the cue instantly. He gently escorted the receptionist out, shutting the door with barely a sound.

A heavy silence settled over the office. The atmosphere now buzzed with tension, the new arrival shifting the mood completely.

"Claude?" Hannah stared at the man who'd just walked in,thrown off balance."Why are you here?"

Her mind whirled, replaying everything that had happened moments before. Then it clicked. Her phone. Vincent had tossed it aside. Her eyes shot to it. The screen still faintly lit up,the display showing "In Call." That kiss-the breathless struggle,every sound-had Claude listened to it all in real time?

Panic flashed across Hannah's face. She lunged for the phone,snatching it off the table and ending the call, her hands trembling ever so slightly. She took a steadying breath, trying to compose herself, and then faced Claude. "About what just happened..."

Claude's eyes paused on her tense fingers gripping the phone,but his face stayed composed and warm, not giving anything
but his face stayed composed and warm, not giving anything away. He didn't mention the call. He offered no accusation.Instead,he moved closer, meeting her gaze with quiet care. "I was worried about you," he said, his voice gentle. "So I came."

His words were direct-protective, yet pointed. "You're okay?He didn't lay a hand on you, did he?"

Hannah shook her head right away. "No, not at all. It was just work stuff. Things... just got a little heated, that's all." She tried to make it sound like nothing but a workplace spat.

Claude studied her for a second and then offered a small nod,letting the subject rest.

Meanwhile, Sharon had been quietly sizing up their unannounced guest-a polished young man with a quiet authority, whose protectiveness toward Hannah hadn't gone unnoticed. A trace of curiosity and skepticism flickered across her face. "And you are..."

Hannah opened her mouth to respond, but Claude beat her to it. He stepped in closer, slipping a gentle arm around her shoulders and nodding courteously. "Glad to meet you. I'm Claude Hobbes, Hannah's boyfriend."

"Boyfriend?" Sharon's eyes flew wide, the news clearly taking her by surprise. She glanced back and forth between Claude and Hannah and then shot a quick look at Vincent-still standing silently and looking none too pleased-before returning her gaze to Claude.

"Hannah, you have a boyfriend already?" Sharon asked, a mix of astonishment and something more complicated in her voice.

Claude's hand tightened just a fraction on Hannah's shoulder,and in that moment, she knew exactly what he was doing-stepping in to shield her. She didn't offer any further explanation. instead, she met Sharon's eyes and gave a tiny,silent nod, quietly backing Claude's claim.
From the instant Claude entered, Vincent's eyes had never left Hannah. The word "boyfriend" had set his jaw rigid, and when he caught her silent nod, a dangerous heat sparked in his gaze,raw and unrestrained.

Claude, for his part, easily picked up on the undercurrent in Sharon's surprise, and he didn't miss the crackling tension pouring off Vincent. He offered a smooth, courteous smile."Hannah is... truly remarkable and endearing."

Affection colored every syllable. With a slight turn, he aimed his next words directly at Vincent. "Mr. Jones, you've already made a name for yourself in the business world-formidable and accomplished. Maybe it's time to think about settling down?"

He let the suggestion linger and then added, voice cool but sharp, "It doesn't exactly look good to be hanging around someone else's girlfriend, does it?"

The implication was crystal clear-and provocative.

Claude's arm tightened protectively around Hannah's shoulders,drawing her closer in a clear display of where he stood.

Claude's move was nothing short of a public claim,unapologetic and clear.

Time seemed to freeze for a few seconds.

Vincent's face gave nothing away, but his gaze darted to Claude's arm around Hannah, chilled and sharp, as if his stare alone could scorch it off. Then, he looked at Hannah, his words flat as he said, "No rush for that."

Claude picked up on Vincent's stiff reply, and for a moment,a glimmer of amusement, tinged with something almost cutting sparked in his eyes. He pulled Hannah even nearer. "Is that so?Funny, because we're in a bit of a hurry."

He leaned in a little closer to Hannah, his eyes softening as
He leaned in a little closer to Hannah, his eyes softening as they lingered on her. Then, in a voice full of quiet conviction,he said, "If it were up to me, I'd marry her tomorrow."

With that, he pressed a gentle kiss to her hair, his expression a mix of satisfaction and open, possessive pride.
###Chapter 283 They Were Kissing

Suddenly,a heavy silence fell over the room. All eyes went to Hannah.

As soon as Claude declared, "I'd marry Hannah tomorrow,"a sharp glint flashed in Vincent's eyes. He didn't bother looking at Claude. Instead, he fixed a frosty stare on Hannah. "Really eager to get married?"

His words sliced through the air, cold and biting

Heat rushed to Hannah's face, her cheeks burning in response to his challenge. She jerked her chin up, meeting his gaze with a mix of embarrassment and defiance. "Absolutely not."

Her voice wavered, betraying how rattled she felt.

Finally, Vincent shifted his focus to Claude, his tone cool and detached. "She's not in any rush."

Just five words, but each one landed like a subtle blow.

Claude sensed the subtle shift in Hannah's body as she stiffened beside him. He took a steady breath, tamping down his own irritation. Instead of losing his cool, he casually relaxed his hold on her, his posture easy. "Taking it slow has its perks,"he said smoothly. "Gives me longer to plan the most unforgettable wedding anyone's ever seen."

Silence settled once more.

Claude looked at Hannah, a gentle smile on his lips. "Because my girl deserves nothing less."

With Claude so close, speaking of grand gestures and lavish promises, Hannah couldn't help but feel awkward and flustered
promises,Hannah couldn't help but feel awkward and flustered.A swirl of emotions left her unsettled; Claude's performance as her "boyfriend" was starting to blur the line, leaving her genuinely confused.

Vincent's gaze remained locked on Hannah. To him, the way she lowered her eyes suggested an almost bashful excitement -a woman swept up by the idea of a grand wedding. The air around him seemed to crackle, simmering with a fury he fought to contain.

Claude caught sight of Vincent's stormy expression and let his own smile grow just a shade more pronounced. He turned to Hannah. "Come on, Hannah. Let's go."

She gave a small, affirmative nod. "Alright."

Claude kept his arm securely around her as he strode toward the door, confidence and pride trailing behind him like a victorious flag.

Hannah kept close, never faltering as they headed for the door.

But as they neared Vincent, she couldn't help buttense for just a heartbeat-still, she didn't stop or glance back.

"The contract." Vincent's voice cut through the room,cold and measured. "You're not interested in discussing it anymore?"

Hannah stopped in her tracks, glancing back over her shoulder with casual indifference. "Honestly, Mr. Jones, are you really in the mood to talk business right now?"

With that, she looked back ahead, walking out with Claude and leaving Vincent behind without a second thought.

The office doors swung shut behind them, sealing in the heavy,lingering silence.

Sharon leaned on her cane, her eyes lingering on the closed
1Sharon leaned on her cane, her eyes lingering on the closed doors as she exhaled softly. "Vincent, they truly do look good together." Then, after a pause,her voice grew quieter, heavier -with the weight of certainty. "You and Hannah... That Chapter is closed for good."

Her words fell with the weight of a verdict, shutting off any hope Vincent might've clung to.

Vincent jerked his head toward his grandmother. His face had darkened beyond anger, nearly pale with contained rage. His jaw was clenched so hard that the veins at his temples pulsed visibly. He opened his mouth, wanting to refute her words,but nothing came out. Words failed him as he couldn't think of a single thing to say.

Suddenly, a quiet knock shattered the tension.

Derek entered, looking grave. He made his way straight to Vincent,bending down to speak in a hushed tone. "Mr. Jones,we've found Ms. Stanton."

The heaviness in the room broke in an instant.

"Where is she?" Vincent's voice was ragged and sharp as steel.

"Rosevale," Derek answered, measured and calm. "In an old neighborhood-she's been renting a place there."

Sharon's whole demeanor changed in a flash. She straightened,her eyes wide with shock. "Erica is living somewhere like that?"Disbelief and worry colored her words. "Take me there. Right now."

Clutching her cane, Sharon hurried out of the office, Derek trailing behind.

Vincent stood there, alone in the office.

Outside, rain lashed against the windows, the world lost in a furious storm
A wild surge of emotions crashed over Vincent-rage from wounded pride, possessiveness burning hot, and a deep,twisting panic at the thought of losing Hannah forever.

With a violent sweep of his arm, he sent everything on his desk crashing to the floor. Glass shattered. Papers flew. Utter Chaos.

He braced both hands on the cold edge of the desk, his chest heaving as a choked, guttural roar of anguish ripped from his throat.

Vincent didn't bother waiting for his driver. He drove himself,making straight for Nova Tech. The moment he pulled up at the curb, he flung the door open and leapt out of the car.The downpour instantly drenched him, soaking him to the bone.

But before he could head inside, something caught his eye.Not far from the side entrance, in the temporary parking zone,he spotted Claude's car.

Through the half-lowered window on the driver's side, Vincent spotted Claude bending close to the passenger seat-moving in toward Hannah. The angle said everything. They were kissing.

The sight felt like a punch to the gut. The numbness vanished,replaced by a searing ache and a violent surge of helpless jealousy that devoured him whole.
###Chapter 284 He Didn't Come

Inside the car, Hannah and Claude had just been chatting about the lingerie show when Claude's eyes caught sight of Vincent,standing out in the rain some distance away.

A spark of mischief lit up behind Claude's calm expression."Don't move," he murmured, voice gentle. "You've got a bit of lint in your hair."

He leaned in, closing the space between him and Hannah until only a whisper separated their faces. Instead of focusing on Hannah, he turned his head slightly, his gaze cutting through the rain and locking straight onto Vincent, who stood outside,drenched and motionless.

A faint, mocking smile played at Claude's lips. He lingered there,his breath brushing Hannah's ear with deliberate warmth.

Hannah tensed, caught off guard. "Claude?"

His hand hovered over her hair, never actually making contact.His expression stayed gentle. "All done."

She beamed at him. "Thanks." After a moment, her tone softened, edged with sincerity. "And, for before. You really sold it."

Claude's smile faltered, just for a heartbeat. "You thought I was pretending?"

His eyes locked onto hers, so intense that it made her heart stumble.

A strange feeling stirred inside her. She parted her lips to speak,but nothing came out. The look in his eyes was too much-bare,
but nothing came out. The look in his eyes was too much-bare,unfiltered, impossible to meet. She turned away her head,letting her gaze wander to the hazy streetlights glowing beyond the window. Wasn't it all just an act? The question echoed in her thoughts.

Claude noticed the subtle way she pulled back. He meant those words uttered inside Vincent's office. He longed for Hannah-every part of her. He wanted her to belong to him,and no one else. But that tiny flicker in her eyes? It doused the fire in him like a bucket of ice.

Now wasn't the time, he cautioned himself. He knew her too well. Push her now, and she'd slip right through his fingers. He'd waited this long, watching her slowly slip away from Vincent.He couldn't risk a single careless move. One mistake, and she'd vanish from his life for good. Some pursuits, he reminded himself, demanded patience.

Quickly smoothing over the storm in his gaze, Claude replaced it with his usual gentle smile. "Did I frighten you?"

His tone was mellow, almost comforting.

Hannah misunderstood, thinking he was referring to the impromptu "wedding" line he'd tossed out in front of Vincent.She shook her head, her voice regaining its usual sharp clarity."No,not at all."

The truth was, she hadn't even paid Claude any heed at that time, all her attention on Vincent's reaction to Claude's abrupt appearance.All she could see was Vincent-staggered, furious,for once completely stripped of his composure. She'd seen it all. And for some reason, seeing Vincent unravel-so raw and exposed-made something inside her relax. The breath she'd been holding for so long finally slipped free. And strangely, it felt good.

Claude reached over and gave her head a gentle pat. "Good."
This time, Hannah simply angled her head away-she didn't pull away. After everything, the stiff formality that used to define their relationship had faded away. What remained was a comfortable, almost sibling-like familiarity, filled with the freedom to tease and be at ease.

Claude glanced at her office building. "Heading back upstairs?"

Hannah shook her head instantly. "No." With Vincent,nothing was certain. The contract could fall apart-or worse, spiral into more chaos. Always pragmatic, she made the call without hesitation. "Let's go meet that model you mentioned."

Earlier, Claude had brought up a model whose style fit the upcoming lingerie show perfectly. There was no better moment to set things in motion. No matter what, this show had to go off without a hitch. Backup plans were essential.

"Absolutely," Claude replied, easing the car into traffic as the rain hammered down.

Outside,the storm grew even fiercer. Vincent stayed rooted in place, his gaze fixed on where the car had vanished, fury still smoldering in his eyes.

Meanwhile, in a run-down corner of the city, a subtle black sedan idled at the entrance of a narrow alley.

Erica sat in the back seat, her makeup flawless and her Chanel suit perfectly tailored-an image of sophistication that couldn't have looked more out of place against the backdrop of peeling paint and trash-strewn pavement.

She lounged back, absently spinning her phone between her fingers.

The screen flickered on as a new message flashed. "The target is en route.Fifteen minutes."

A cold, victorious smile curled across Erica's lips. "So that old
A cold, victorious smile curled across Erica's lips. "So that old witch finally took the bait?"

She smirked. Good. Just what she'd been counting on-Sharon scrambling straight to Vincent. Every piece was sliding neatly into place.

She slipped out of the car and disappeared into the rundown building.Navigating the dim hallway with effortless confidence,she settled onto a battered old couch she'd scavenged from a junkyard just for this occasion.

With slow, deliberate motions, she began to dismantle her perfect appearance, smearing lipstick, wiping away the foundation, twisting her hair into a tangled mess.

Footsteps pounded up the stairs, hurried and desperate.

The door burst open, and Sharon appeared, eyes locking on Erica, who was now curled up on the filthy couch, the picture of misery.

"Erica!" Sharon gasped, real distress in her voice.

"Mom," Erica whispered, lifting her head with a trembling sob."I messed up... I swear I'll never do it again."

Even as Erica spoke, her eyes darted anxiously toward the doorway. She asked in a fragile voice, "Where's Vincent?"

She was bracing for Sharon to say, "He's just outside," or maybe, "He'll be here any second."

After all, she'd done everything she could to look completely broken.

But Sharon only replied, "He didn't come."

Erica's head jerked up from Sharon's embrace. All her plotting,all the careful theatrics, and still, Vincent hadn't shown? He wouldn't even spare a single glance her way?
###Chapter 285 You're Nothing Like Him

The model Claude had endorsed was a remarkable pick-her figure and aesthetic resonated precisely with the vision VelaCore intended to express. Regrettably, the outcome veered from expectations.

"Ms. Scott," Meagan murmured regretfully, placing the phone down as she turned to Hannah, who had just stepped out of a meeting. "The model's agent just got back to me. She inked a solo agreement with an emerging global athletic label two days ago-at a premium offer."

The agent had conveyed genuine remorse, though business was business.

Hannah frowned slightly, tapping the table. Top-tier models-especially those who fit a niche brand vision-were always in short supply.

"Understood," she replied evenly without a hint of irritation."Keep tracking any prospects that match our tone. Prioritize those with haute couture runway experience. Adhere to the original timeframe-don't let this impact the event's preparation sequence."

"Got it, Ms. Scott," Meagan affirmed promptly, scribbling notes swiftly before getting to work.

Because of Hannah's clear-headed command, momentum wasn't lost despite the modeling hurdle. The team immediately shifted into high gear.

Several days afterward, Hannah had just wrapped up a remote session and was skimming logistics assessments when a faint rapping echoed at her worksnace ontrance
Meagan entered quietly, holding a modest parcel. "Ms. Scott,this came in. Needs your attention. No sender listed."

Hannah halted her reading and looked up. "Leave it here."

Meagan placed it gently on the broad desk and exited without a word.

Hannah eyed the package-no inscriptions, no branding. She assumed it was yet another contract or procurement document.

She picked up the letter blade and split the seal. But as the contents revealed themselves, she stiffened.

It was the same contract she had once personally delivered to Vincent's workplace-genuine, advantageous, and fair-only to be greeted by his outrageous proposition to "stay with him for a month" in return for his cooperation.

And beneath the final page of terms, there it was, his signature,bold, graceful, and unmistakably imprinted. He actually signed it! No strings. No callbacks. No messages. No warning. Just quietly mailed over?

Hannah gazed at the contract, her eyes moving between the clean lines of clauses and that familiar, commanding signature.Her fingertips instinctively folowed the deliberate sweep of his signature.

A sensation she couldn't fully place began to unfurl-quiet,steady, and expanding like gentle ripples from a tossed pebble.A flicker of something unspoken shimmered in her look, but it vanished almost instantly, smothered by sheer control.

Realigning herself, she banished the daze his signature had triggered. Without hesitation, she picked up her device and dialed with brisk precision. Her tone was composed and executive. "Alice, it's me. The deal's locked in. You're headlining the finale-no one else even comes close."
Elsewhere, in an opulent residence, Erica reclined on a grand velvet couch, her silk robe left loosely open.

One of her hands trailed idly along the jawline and cheek of the man on top of her. This face-after all that cosmetic work -resembled Vincent's even more now.

Logan remained obedient, eager for affirmation, as she caressed his skin with idle strokes.

"Mmm..." Erica purred, her eyes glazed and sensual. "You feel better today..."

Her touch dropped to his throat, fingers clenching subtly.Logan responded with a hushed gasp, drawing nearer, thrusting into her with more force.

As his pace intensified, Erica hooked a finger under his chin, but her mind was already elsewhere.

Last time, after Sharon tracked her down, she had returned to the Jones family estate with Sharon. But Vincent still shut her out. He even refused to appear.

The thought triggered a fierce spasm in her chest. Emotion surged,her voice spiked-sharp, wild. "Why didn't you show up?Vincent, speak to me! Why didn't you see me?"

The hand that once teased Logan's chin snapped to his neck,tightening mercilessly.

Her grip was savage. Logan's face reddened as he tumbled away, his hands clawing at hers, choking out frail,terrified gasps.

Just as his vision dimmed,her fingers released.

A glimpse of lucidity flickered in Erica's expression as he crumpled beside the couch, panting and pleading.


"Get out"cho qiachod bor robo clorod not coaring him-
"Get out." She cinched her robe closed, not sparing him a glance. Her voice was razor-sharp, her tone dismissive, like banishing a stray. "You're nothing like him-especially when you're groveling like this."

Logan bolted, humiliated but grateful to escape.

Erica grabbed her device from the low table. The screen lit up instantly, and a headline cut through her like a blade."VelaCore's Lingerie Show Metamorphosis Made Official-Supermodel Alice Dubois Confirmed to Headline."

Hannah's triumphant moment, as if Erica would let that unfold uneventfully. Since Vincent shunned her, she would retaliate against Hannah.

She dialed a number with precision. Her voice was stripped of warmth,now sharp and venom-laced. "Secure me an invitation to the lingerie event. And find every piece of dirt on Alice Dubois. I want her flaws-now."
###Chapter 286 The Latest Boyfriend

Metamorphosis' long-awaited lingerie show had finally come.

"Tracking light in Zone A-two degrees off target." Calm and steady, Hannah spoke as she faced the sweeping master control panel, dozens of live-feed monitors filling her view.

"Hannah." A gentle voice called her name from behind.

Hannah stopped what she was doing and turned around quickly.

Standing there was Claude-tall, polished, his smoke-gray custom suit highlighting his effortless grace.

A subtle smile appeared on Hannah's lips. "Claude."

"Everything in place?" His question was about the show, but his attention never left her.

A soft smile lingered as Hannah replied, "We're in the final stretch. Your seat is front row, right in the center."

Claude gave a slight nod. "I can't wait."

Claude looked as though he wanted to add something,but a suited man approached just then, holding a bouquet of irises.

Hannah recognized him immediately-Kenneth, Miles's trusted assistant.

"Ms. Scott, Mr. Whitaker wanted you to have these before the show," Kenneth remarked politely. He offered her the bouquet with professional care. "Mr. Whitaker was called away for an urgent international deal. He regrets missing the event but hopes Metamorphosis will have an amazing debut."
A flicker of amusement lit up Hannah's face as she accepted the flowers."Please thank him for me. That's very thoughtful."She handed the bouquet to her assistant. "They're gorgeous-put them in the lounge for me, would you?"

Kenneth nodded and slipped away quietly.

Just then, a familiar, bright voice rang out. "Hannah!"

Hannah turned and was surprised-but genuinely pleased-to see Irene. "Mrs. Whitaker, I can't believe you made it!"

"Of course I would come. I wasn't about to miss your big night,"Irene said, her whole face lit up with appreciation.

Standing next to lrene, Daphne couldn't have looked less thrilled. Frustration twisted her features as she snapped,"Mom!I told you l didn't want to be here. Why drag me to a place like this?"

A flicker of embarrassment crossed Irene's face. "Well, we're already inside. Let's just support Hannah while we're here."

But Daphne detested watching Hannah shine the most. She jerked her arm free from her mother's grip, like she'd just found an outlet for all her pent-up frustration. Her eyes swept over Claude for a beat-sharp, assessing-before locking onto Hannah with a cruel smirk. "Still got that charm working for you,I see. So, who's this? The latest boyfriend?"

She stretched out the word "latest," making it drip with sarcasm."Didn't take you long, did it? Barely single and you're already swapping men like it's a game. Do you schedule them by the hour now? And you're parading this one around already? What,just trying to show him off?"

"Daphne!" Irene's cheerful expression fell away, replaced with shock and embarrassment. She tugged at Daphne's arm."What's gotten into you? Watch your mouth!"
"Am I wrong, Mom?" Daphne's voice rose, her glare darting between Hannah and Claude. "She just clawed her way out of the gossip involving my brother, and now she's hanging all over Mr. Hobbes? Can't keep a low profile for even a day after the divorce?"

Claude's expression had darkened the moment Daphne's first loaded words left her mouth.

A sudden chill settled in Hannah's eyes, her whole expression hardening in an instant.

Irene tried to say something to salvage the situation, but Hannah didn't give her the chance.

Hannah moved forward, her presence unmistakable, and her words cut through the tension. "Daphne, is your life really so empty that you spend your time twisting other people's relationships into filth? Is this honestly the highlight of your day?"Disdain filled her voice. "All that privilege and support from the Whitaker family, and the only thing you learned was how to gossip."

"You-" Daphne sputtered, her cheeks burning with humiliation as she struggled to reply.

The next second, Claude stepped forward, placing himself protectively in front of Hannah. His tone was even but full of authority as he addressed Daphne, "What you're seeing tonight is the result of her vision, resolve, and hard work-a show of global caliber. And yet all you can offer is cheap commentary from the comfort of a spoiled heiress, riding on nothing but your family name." His voice dropped a degree. "You've disgraced your family."

Daphne's face drained of color, tears spilling before she could hold them back.

Anger and shame pinched Irene's features as she snapped,"Daphne, apologize right now!"
"I... I didn't say anything that wasn't true!" Daphne blurted out,her composure breaking. "She deserves this! Everyone sides with her-why? What's so special about her?"

Losing control, Daphne pushed past a staff member,buried her face in hner hands, and ran for the exit.

"Daphne!" Irene gasped, stunned. She turned to Hannah and quickly offered a stream of apologies. "I'm truly sorry. I'll make sure Miles will make it up to you over this." With that,she gathered up the folds of her skirt and hurried after her daughter.

Claude watched them go for a second before turning back to Hannah. His expression softened. "Don't let people like that upset you."

Hannah stayed calm, her focus unbroken. "They won't."

With a brief nod, she lifted her walkie-talkie. "All units, last thirty-second check. Start the countdown."

Out of sight, a shadowy figure quietly slipped away from the edge of the venue.
###Chapter 287 Troubles At The Show


As the introductory score faded out, the towering drapes ascended with deliberate grace-Metamorphosis, the long-awaited lingerie show, had officially commenced.

Upon the runway, the opening model emerged, sending the entire audience into wild excitement.

Claps, shocked breaths, joyful cries, and shutter clicks melded together.

At the forefront, Claude sat refined, a soft curl tugging at his mouth's edge. His attention wandered now and then to nearby attendees-and more frequently, to the backstage access point.

Tucked in a dim recess of the venue, Erica remained still, chin angled slightly as though absorbed by the presentation. Yet,the hands joined in her lap moved in slight rhythmic taps-like a quiet internal alarm.

High up on the mezzanine, Vincent entered the upper deck. He stayed off to the side, taking everything in silently. His vision moved along the runway. There was no doubt-his thoughts were elsewhere.

Backstage, inside the primary command booth, Hannah issued directives with icy clarity, her aura unshakable.

The models kept surfacing in perfect rhythm.

"Ms. Scott, there's an issue!" Meagan appeared suddenly, face pale and lungs heaving, weaving through the staff to reach Hannah. Her voice was low but quivering. "Miss Whitaker barged into the cosmetics area and wrecked almost evomr:.
barged into the cosmetics area and wrecked almost everything in sight. She's completely unhinged! Even her mother can't restrain her!"

Hannah's expression hardened instantly. But her voice stayed controlled,even more than before. "Alert security-right away.Is she causing trouble in the general cosmetics area, or is it Alice's private prep zone?"

"It's Alice's private room!" Meagan looked like she was on the verge of tears. "She's trashed everything-makeup's all over the place, mirrors shattered everywhere!"

Hannah swiped across her phone screen, pulling up the venue's internal layout. "Alice is the only model who hasn't had her makeup done yet, correct?"

"Correct. Her stylist was mid-session when the chaos began,"Meagan replied.

"Understood." Hannah nodded. No pause. "P'll handle it."

The cosmetics chamber looked like a storm had struck.

Irene clung desperately to her daughter, trying to restrain her as she cried, "Daphne, please-just stop! I'm begging you!"

But Daphne flailed wildly in her mother's arms, shrieking through sobs, "Hell no! I'll ruin everything! Everyone treats that slut like royalty! Who the hell is she? It's just a damn makeup room-our family can pay for it! A hundredfold! I'll see to it that her precious event turns to ash!"

Right as the last syllable spilled out, Hannah stepped into view.

Daphne broke free from her mother's grasp, seized the lone remaining serum on the vanity, and flungit violently-straight at the wall beside Hannah.

"Hannah!" Irene cried out, horrified.
Yet,Hannah remained unshaken. Her stance did not shift.

The bottle burst against the wall, liquid streaking the floor below, pooling at her feet.

Hannah stared at Daphne-eyes blood-rimmed,hair a wreck.Then,she advanced.

Without forewarning, Hannah struck Daphne sharply across the face.

The entire room fell into stunned silence.

Daphne's head whipped from the impact. A loud ring filled her ears. For one long beat, shame and fire clouded her mind. Then,rage struck, and she lunged, wailing,"You hit me! How dare you?"

Hannah gripped her wrist mid-lunge. "Daphne, if you want to throw tantrums, know your setting and your victim. You come storming into the backstage like a lunatic-getting slapped is the least of what you deserve."

Though not loud, her words had bite. She shifted toward the waiting security. Her voice had zero give. "We've got a serious disturbance backstage. Remove this lunatic-discreetly.Keep the guests unaware."

Two guards moved swiftly, each securing one of Daphne's arms.

"Who do you think you are? Let go of me! Hannah, what gives you the right to remove me? Ask them to release me!"Daphne's screaming echoed down the corridor as she was dragged away.

Irene looked crushed by embarrassment and shame. "Hannah,I'm deeply sorry for this disruption."

She'd spotted the invitation from Miles and, on a whim,decided to bring Daphne along. She never saw this catastrophe coming.
Hannah gently patted the back of her hand. "It's okay, Mrs.Whitaker.Really."

She offered soothing words and assigned a staff member to gently accompany Irene out.

Then, Hannah addressed Alice and her stylists, "I truly regret this awful incident."

Her voice stayed firm as she instructed the stunned staff,"Please take Alice to a fresh makeup suite now. Have this space cleaned immediately. Log all damaged items.Styling team -resume prep."

After everything was sorted, Hannah slipped into a shadowed niche beside the runway-a perfect perch to observe the guests without being noticed. She scanned reactions-guests were still fully engaged.

She had barely begun to breathe when Meagan appeared again,face drenched in sweat. "Ms. Scott-a new issue just arose."

Hannah sighed. "Is it Daphne again? Notify law enforcement immediately."

Meagan shook her head. "No... it's something else. Please follow me.You need to see this."
###Chapter 288 Last-Minute Stand-In


Hannah stormed into the makeup room, barely pausing as the door banged against the wall. Shock painted her face the instant she took in the scene before her.

Alice hunched over in the chair, her skin a patchwork of swollen red welts. Clusters of small blisters had already started to bubble up along her arms and neck.

Hannah's arrival drew a hoarse whimper from Alice. Her hands clamped so tightly to the armrests that her knuckles looked almost bloodless. "I can't face anyone looking like this. I just can't."

Panic laced Hannah's words as she demanded, "Where is the doctor? Why hasn't anyone from the medical team shown up yet?"

A trembling makeup assistant answered with a shaky voice,tears gathering at the corners of her eyes, "T-They're coming!I called for them, I swear!"

Meagan kept darting glances between Alice's rash and the clock on her wrist. When she finally spoke, her words tumbled out in a rush. "Ms. Scott, there's less than half an hour before Alice goes on. The press is out there, and half the crowd is here just to see her! What are we supposed to do?"

With the finale hanging on this one moment, the entire show threatened to collapse.

All eyes turned to Hannah.

In Hannah's head, solutions collided and crumbled. Cancel the finale? Find a last-minute replacement? But who could step in
finale? Find a last-minute replacement? But who could step in now? Who could handle the stress? What would the media say?No.Falling apart was not an option.

Just as the room seemed to spiral into hopeless silence,Hannah snapped her head up. Her voice cut through the panic like steel. "I'll take her place."

Gasps rippled around her. For a moment, nobody seemed sure they'd heard her correctly.

Even Alice, still shivering from pain and fear, stopped crying.She stared at Hannah in shock.

The visual director was the first to react. "Ms. Scott,you can't!That's not a good call!"

Anxiety tied her tongue in knots. "So many guests came just to see Alice-the entire finale was designed around her.Her look,her presence-it's irreplaceable. If you go onstage now,everyone will think you've fooled them and tried to steal the spotlight. The press will tear the brand apart. This could be a disaster, worse than any lighting mishap or wardrobe malfunction!"

No defense came from Hannah. Instead, she calmly faced the director and asked, "How about you go up there instead?"

The director froze, face flushing instantly. "L.. No,I can't do it.I couldn't possibly..."

"Then it's settled." Already, Hannah was looking past the director. Right now, nothing mattered more than finishing the show. Only by pulling through could everyone's sleepless nights mean something in the end.

Hannah didn't spare anyone another glance. Her voice rang out,crisp and unshakable. "Listen up, everyone. We have thirty minutes. Get me ready for the runway. That's it."

Every person in the room snapped into action.
Hannah drew in a deep breath and shut her eyes, trusting the team to work magic on her.



On the runway, the chorus looped one extra time-an unscheduled repeat.

Some of the most recognizable faces in the industry,veteran supermodels with poise to spare, stepped onto the runway once more, following an emergency backup routine.

Positioned in the forefront, Claude lifted his champagne flute,his fingers tapping out a slow, steady rhythm againstthe glass.

Polished as ever, he wore an easy smile, though a brief shadow of uncertainty flickered in his eyes. Timing felt out of sync.Doubts crept in. Was Alice still not ready?

In a dim corner of the venue, Erica's gaze drifted casually over the models making their second appearance. Amusement danced at the edge of her lips, growing a touch sharper with every extra loop. It looked like Hannah's show was starting to fall apart.

From his perch on the mezzanine, Vincent remained distant from the noise and lights, his gaze heavy as it scanned the stage below. Time crawled by while Alice remained missing.A heavy sense of foreboding began to creep over him, tightening its grip with every passing second.

Restlessness stirred among the guests, spreading like an invisible shiver through the rows.

"Wait, aren't these the same models we saw earlier?"

"Where's Alice? Isn't the finale supposed to start by now?"

Whispers mnoved from seat to seat, breaking the collective trance that had gripped the room moments earlier.
Just then, all the runway lights went out in an instant. The enormous hall was instantly swallowed by darkness.

Only one structure remained visible. The glowing outline of the massive centerpiece-a giant cocoon, faintly radiating cold,silvery threads of light.

Silence swept over the crowd at once. Every gaze was drawn,instinctively, to the centerpiece.

Suddenly, mechanical gears ground into motion, their hum barely audible. Layer after layer of the cocoon peeled back,unfolding with deliberate drama. Blinding white light burst from its core.

People flinched, shielding their faces from the glare. A wave of astonished gasps traveled through the room.

Then, right in the center of that brilliant light, a poised,statuesque figure stepped forward, every movement controlled and deliberate.

Spotlights swiveled, locking onto the lone silhouette.

Recognition dawned in an instant, pulling a shocked cry from every corner of the room. Why was it Hannah?
###Chapter 289 Sabotage

Hannah emerged onto the runway, illumination highlighting each nuance of her ensemble.

She donned a sheer lace top, adorned with myriad sapphire-toned gemstone specks that caught the light with every gesture. The bottom was a daring departure-crafted solely from linked platinum loops.

The ensemble radiated like flowing astral essence.

A hush of astonishment traveled across the spectators

"Hold on... Isn't that Ms. Scott? Why is she the finale model?"

"Honestly? She's pulling this off-looks just as stunning as the seasoned models."

A reverberation of shock surged across the space.

Seated in front, Claude's trademark gentle grin stiffened. His grip instinctively constricted around the champagne flute's stem,the skin on his hand going pale.

The astonishment and appreciation gleaming in his stare was barely masked-he hadn't braced for this. This moment struck him with the sheer intensity of Hannah's dazzling presence.

And then, a laugh escaped him. A wild desire arose to seize her offstage and lock her away-where only his eyes would ever witness her, where she existed only within his reach.

Up on the mezzanine, Vincent's eyes widened. From his perch,Hannah's figure remained in full view. His heart felt like it had been struck-hard and sudden-by something ineffable. It wasn't corporate exhilaration. It wasn't the appreciation of genius design. It pierced deeper. Something ruptured the
genius design. It pierced deeper. Something ruptured the logical scaffolding he'd spent years erecting.

He now saw a version of Hannah he hadn't fully understood until now. That magnetism. That gravity. It wasn't mere charm -it exuded dominance, majesty.

He gulped, throat tightening sharply. And from nowhere, a recollection surfaced-her voice, "I believe your feelings are clear now."

A hand rose instinctively to his chest, where his pulse thundered beneath the skin. Maybe she'd been right.

In the corner of the venue, Erica's expression shifted violently.The iciness of smug control vanished-overridden by stunned fury and scalding outrage that nearly devoured her. How the heck had things unfolded like this? Rather than sabotaging Hannah's show, she had inadvertently handed Hannah an opportunity to elevate the event into an even brighter spectacle.

The flip, the overwhelming collapse-it was intolerable. Erica clutched her seat's arm so fiercely that her knuckles bleached,her features contorted by wrath.

Meanwhile, Hannah exited the luminous runway wearing her gem-dusted stilettos, each footfall resounding beneath thunderous cheers and the gazes of scores of captivated spectators.

But as soon as the drape descended, severing her from the crowd's eruption, her stance crumbled entirely. She pressed her spine against the cold wall, inhaling in gulps,chest heaving as the tension ebbed at last.

That short walk-that gleam, the gazes, the silent void before the score rose-had drained her completely.

Silently,Hannah retreated into her private chamber, yearning for a breath alone.
But solitude barely lingered half a moment.

"Hannah!" The sharp rhythm of stilettos echoed rapidly before Vicki stormed inside.

Vicki had caught every instant backstage-Hannah's path on the runway hadn't seemed improvised whatsoever. It felt rehearsed. Purposeful. There was no doubt in her mind-Hannah never planned for Alice to appear tonight.

"What a spectacle!" Vicki spat, venom coating every syllable."Impressive, truly. You had played everyone like a fool." She flung her arms out dramatically. "That ovation out there? All that praise? Bet you're thrilled, Ms. Scott-stepping up by trampling someone else. Feels incredible, huh?"

Team members nearby began to drift over, pulled by the rising voices. Their faces reflected shock, anger, and growing indignation at the accusations.

Meagan, in particular, looked infuriated and advanced, though Hannah halted her with a glacial motion.

Hannah lifted her gaze to meet Vicki's eyes, calm and sharp."You've got a vivid imagination, Vicki. Shame it's so poorly applied."

That jab only stoked Vicki's rage. Her voice pitched higher."Poorly appolied? I stood there watching Alice erupt in hives SO severe that she collapsed. And it happened today,right before the finale. Don't tell me it was all an accident!"

Her eyes burned into Hannah, demanding answers.

Around them, whispers circulated among the gathering staff.

Hannah's mouth curled into an icy arc, her stare razor-sharp."Accident? Who told you it was an accident?"

The entire space froze. Even Vicki's tongue stalled in shock.Her voice faltered. "W-What do you mean?"
Hannah straightened. Her eyes held Vicki's as she answered with slow precision, "I mean, it was no coincidence. Alice was sabotaged-intentionally. Someone wanted to ruin this show,and they didn't care if it destroyed her career in the process."

The charge hit Vicki like a slap-but then her expression twisted into something darker. She lunged verbally, sharper than before. "Sabotaged? What a slick cover-up. Tell me,who in this locked-down backstage could pull off such sabotage-without you being complicit?"

Her voice spiked with intensity. "I think it was your doings. You engineered this. You made sure Alice had an allergic reaction,then swooped in and took her spotlight. You're the mastermind behind all of it!"
###Chapter 290 Showing Up Uninvited


Vicki's hand shook as she leveled her finger at Hannah, the accusation hanging in the air like a live wire.

Around them, a wave of outrage rippled through the staff.

A junior designer blurted, "Ms. Scott would never pull something like that!"

Before she could say more, the senior designer next to her quickly tugged her back, silencing her protest.

Faced with the vicious accusations, Hannah's face stayed remarkably composed, betraying not a flicker of irritation. Her gaze was steady, her tone cold and razor-sharp. "Vicki, your reasoning is every bit as absurd as your accusation. Alice is my partner-I've put too much on the line for her. She's my trump card."

She arched a brow, her confidence radiating in the hush that followed. "Tell me, Vicki, do you think I-Hannah Scott-need cheap theatrics for spotlight?"

A faint, sardonic smile tugged at her lips. "I'm the headliner here. There's no need to outshine anyone, least of all my own partner."

Her words cracked through the air, leaving Vicki's complexion ashen.

Without raising her voice, Hannah projected sheer authority."I'll say this once, and I expect every word to sink in. What happened to Alice-since it occurred at my event-falls on me.I'll see that the investigation, accountability, punishment, and compensation are handled, every last detail."
Her gaze glittered with a hard-edged resolve. "But for you to fling such disgusting, groundless accusations? To claim I would sabotage my own partner just to make myself look good?"

She swept her eyes over Vicki, whose agitation had left her eyes bloodshot and wild. "Frankly, your imagination is as pitiful as your judgment."

A chorus of stunned gasps echoed around the room. Meagan and the others looked on, awestruck by Hannah's unwavering composure.

Vicki, frozen in shock, could only stare, rendered speechless by Hannah's fierce presence. Her lips parted, but the biting accusations caught her tongue,leaving her speechless.

A flush of shame washed over Vicki, but her pride as an agent held firm. "Fine, Hannah-your tactics are merciless, and your performance is award-caliber. I'll watch and wait. Just make sure you've got the muscle to bury those whispers."

With that, she spun on her heel and strode out, heels tapping out her fury on the floor.

Even after Vicki walked away, the air backstage only thickened with the sting of the earlier clash.

Every gaze fell to Hannah.

Hannah released a long, shaky breath, voice steady but tired."That's enough. You're all dismissed."

Meagan hesitated, worry flickering in her eyes, but she didn't protest. She gave Hannah a subtle nod before ushering everyone out, the door clicking shut behind them.

Left alone,Hannah slumped into the nearest armchair, eyelids fluttering closed as exhaustion pressed down on her.

After a stretch of silence, she inhaled deeply, forcing herself upright. Steeling her nerves, she slipped out of her show attire
upright. Steeling her nerves, she slipped out of her show attire and pulled on a pink-lavender dress, her movements slow but determined.

Standing with her back to the door, Hannah lifted her arms,fingertips searching for the tiny zipper nestled at her lower back. Her muscles trembled with fatigue; no matter how she strained, the clasp stayed just out of reach.

A faint metallic click broke the silence-someone was quietly unlocking the door and slipping inside.

"Meagan?" Hannah called out, hoping her assistant had returned. "Could you help me with the zipper?" She angled her body,exposing her back in expectation.

Footsteps padded softly over the floor, drawing nearer. She heard the subtle rustle of clothing behind her.

Suddenly, warm breath brushed against the nape of her neck,tinged with a clean, familiar scent.

Hannah's entire body went rigid, nerves prickling with alarm.That was not Meagan. She recognized that scent instantly.

Instinct overriding hesitation, Hannah spun around, heart hammering in her chest.

Vincent's face, sharp and expressionless, was the first thing she saw.

At some point, he'd slipped behind her without making a sound,barely half a step away.

Instead of his usual jacket, he wore a tailored black velvet shirt -one button left undone at the collar, the sleeves pushed up to reveal a platinum watch gleaming on his wrist.

"Mr. Jones?" Hannah forced her tone to stay calm, masking the jolt of alarm that shot through her veins. She managed a cool,businesslike smile. "I don't recall seeing your name on the
businesslike smile. "I don't recall seeing your name on the guest list. Is there something I can help you with?"

Careful not to make a scene, she inched backward, discreetly increasing the distance between them.

Vincent's eyes lingered on her composed facade, reading through the mask of calm she'd put on.

He ignored her question entirely. Instead, he closed their distance and, with unhurried authority, placed his hand firmly on her shoulder. The gesture was almost gentle, but it brooked no refusal. Effortlessly, he turned her until she was facing away from him again-his presence suddenly filling the space behind her.

"Showing up uninvited-rather impolite of me, I'll admit," he murmured, voice low and steady, every syllable carefully controlled. But beneath that cool exterior, tension simmered just beneath the surface.

His fingertips skimnmed lightly over her lower back, finding the slender zipper and catching it with practiced ease.

The brush of his skin against hers sent an involuntary tremor up her spine.

He drew the zipper upward in one slow, deliberate motion,the soft whirring sound oddly intimate in the cramped, silent dressing room.

Vincent dipped closer, his breath warm as it danced over her ear. He murmured, "Now that I've signed Alice,it makes sense to witness her performance up close."

He leaned in slightly, voicesofter, his lips just shy of her earlobe. "I just never imagined tonight would take such an unexpected turn... or that I'd stumble across something even more intriguing."

A flicker of surprise crossed Hannah's face, her brow arching.
Before she could muster a reply, a sharp click echoed from outside-the distinct sound of the lock being twisted.
###Chapter 291 Hiding Me Again

A faint click echoed through the dressing room-the soft turn of the doorknob, shockingly loud against the hush inside the room.

Hannah's pulse spiked, her muscles freezing tight. Vicki? Was that woman back already? If Vicki caught her alone with Vincent, the gossip mill would spin out of control, trashing her reputation in seconds.

Hannah didn't hesitate. Reflexes kicking in, she reached out and clamped a hand around Vincent's cool wrist.

"Go. Hide." She shoved him urgently toward the curtained nook off to the side, her words little more than a breath.

She'd just wrapped up the show. The last thing she needed was some messy headline about her private life hijacking everything she and her team had worked so hard for.

Vincent blinked, momentarily startled by her sudden shove. He glanced down at her slender fingers clamped tight around his wrist.

Instead of letting her shove him away, he twisted his arm with effortless grace, drawing her in until there was barely a breath between them.

The heat radiating off his body mingled with hers; the air seemed to crackle between heartbeats.

A lazy, predatory grin played across his lips, sharpening his features with a dangerous charm. "Hiding me again, Hannah?"

His voice rumbled low, threaded with unfiltered amusement.
His voice rumbled low, threaded with unfiltered amusement."What happened to the Hannah I remember-the one who spins every PR disaster into a front-page win? Are you really telling me a surprise guest is all it takes to knock you off balance?"

His casual taunting-delivered at the worst possible moment-almost made her snap. She shot him a blistering glare, her voice tight with exasperation. "Oh, you've got a brilliant plan?I just walked off the runway, and now I'm alone in a dressing room with my ex-husband. Do you think that's the kind of headline I need right now?"

If it were Vicki turning the doorknob outside the dressing room,with Vicki's talent in throwing baseless accusations, what happened after Vicki barged in would be a total disaster.

"| couldn't care less about anyone's opinions." His breath skimmed her ear, hot and close, making her shiver.

Hannah had no patience left for arguing with him on this. She shoved him again, more forcefully this time.

Suddenly, the doorknob stopped turning.

Beyond the doorway, two young women's hesitant voices drifted through, crisp yet wavering.

"Hold on, this room seemed to be marked for Ms. Scott. Oops -wrong room for us-it's the one next door."

"Oh, thank God we didn't walk in. That would've been beyond embarrassing. Let's go,hurry!"

Their footsteps scrambled away, chased by sheepish, muffled laughter.

So,it was not Vicki. Just a pair of models who'd confused this room for another. The tension in the air dissolved in an instant,leaving Hannah hollowed out and trembling. Her strength vanished, the adrenaline crash leaving her dizzy and,damp with
vanished, the adrenaline crash leaving her dizzy and damp with sweat beneath her clothes. She let out an uneven exhale,fingers slackening on Vincent's wrist.

Vincent immediately noticed the shift in her posture, eyes narrowing as he studied her. He broke the heavy silence with an almost offhand question. "So, what happened with Alice?Why didn't she go on stage?"

Hannah leaned against the edge of the dressing mirror,deliberately avoiding his gaze. "Allergic reaction. Pretty severe.She just couldn't do it."

His eyebrow arched. "Wasn't thata little too convenient?"

Hannah's fingertips drifted along the edge of the mirror, as if tracing patterns could help steady her nerves."Yeah."

He tilted his head, voice lowering as he pressed. "Do you think one of your people set her up?"

Was there a traitor among them? The thought pricked at Hannah, but her gut said no. She closed her eyes and silently ticked through her core staff, dismissing each with a shake of her head. "I really don't think so. But we're not ruling anything out," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

Vincent hadn't taken his eyes off her.

That unwavering focus made her skin crawl. She opened her eyes, only to meet his dark, unfathomable gaze. He still hadn't left.

"The show's finished, Mr. Jones," she said, her words clipped and glacial. "Shouldn't you be on your way out?"

She tipped her chin, gesturing coldly toward the door.

But instead of leaving, Vincent closed the distance with a deliberate step, his tall frame casting a shadow that nearly enveloped her. He leaned in, his voice grazing the shell of her
enveloped her. He leaned in, his voice grazing the shell of her ear. "Turns out you were right."

She frowned at the sudden closeness. What did he mean by that? Her lashes fluttered, confusion flickering in her eyes. Was he referring to what she'd said before-her certainty that there was no traitor on her team?

Her frown deepened. "Maybe I'm wrong. There could still be a traitor..."

He interrupted, smooth and unbothered, "That's not what I'm saying."

She was puzzled. Not that? Then what was he talking about?

Catching the bafflement in her eyes, he offered a faint smile."Cloudtop Restaurant. Three nights from now. Seven o'clock.I'll be waiting."

He wasn't extending a dinner invite. It was an order-delivered with his usual, unquestionable authority.

She blinked, caught off guard. "For what?"

His gaze never wavered. "Dinner."

Hannah's eyes narrowed, defiance sharpening her features. "I have no interest in dining with my ex-husband."
###Chapter 292 Depending On Her Mood


Vincent's face turned stormy, the tension thickening until the air itself felt icy. "I booked out the entire restaurant. I'll be waiting for you," he replied, his voice so calm that it sounded dangerous.

Hannah squared her shoulders, holding his gaze. "What's with the sudden dinner invitation?"

He studied her in silence, a complicated shadow crossing his eyes. "There's unfinished business between us. Things we need to settle."

She shot him a skeptical look. "Why not just say it now?"

"Not here. Not like this." Vincent's brows knit together, a flicker of conflict breaking through his rigid composure. He needed a moment to sort out his thoughts-before facing her again.

A faint, chilly smile played on Hannah's lips. "Is that so? Well,maybe l'll go-if I feel like it."

She stretched out each word, her disinterest unmistakable.Her meaning couldn't have been clearer: whether she'd show up or not depended entirely on her mood.

A flash of anger sparked in Vincent's eyes; for a split second,he looked ready to explode. But after a pause, he inhaled slowly, clamping his eyes shut to steady himself.

When he finally looked at her again, some of the fire had ebbed away. For once, there was a hint of restraint-an unfamiliar trace of compromise. "Fine," he muttered, voice rough and edged with defeat, as if forcing himself to accept a
rough and edged with defeat, as if forcing himself to accept a concession he'd never intended to make.

Before she could even blink, Vincent snatched her phone straight off the makeup counter with a smooth, unhurried motion.

Hannah jolted forward, voice rising with a sharp edge."What do you think you're doing?"

She lunged to grab her phone back, but Vincent dodged her extended hand effortlessly. He tapped in a passcode with cool confidence-his own birthday.

But the screen stayed dark.

His fingers paused. A flicker of surprise crossed his face. His gaze shifted to her, searching her face for an explanation,frustration simmering just beneath the surface.

Hannah's shoulders eased as she caught his reaction. Crossing her arms, she leaned against the counter, an icy, triumphant smile playing at her lips. "Changed the password a long time ago, Mr. Jones." Her tone dripped with mockery. "Did you really think nothing would ever change?"

Vincent held her in his gaze, silent and inscrutable. For an instant, something uncertain flickered in his eyes-a quick flash of vulnerability-before he smoothed it away.

He didn't try the passcode again. He simply held the phone in his palm for a lingering moment, then reached out and offered it back without a word.

She didn't take it right away, eyeing him warily.

His tone was level again. "Unblock my number."

He gave no reason and just issued the demand with his usual,effortless authority. He didn't even bother with a "please."
Hannah's expression tightened, and she took her phone back.
"Give me one good reason."

He didn't flinch. "If you're coming to dinner, I need a way to contact you." Not being able to reach her left an acrid aftertaste on his tongue.

She didn't back down. "And if I refuse?" Her grip on the phone tightened, knuckles blanching as she instinctively recoiled,every muscle taut with defiance.

A shadow flickered across Vincent's eyes. Rather than retreat,he advanced with deliberate force. "Then I'll make sure you hear from me-my way."

Her expression stiffened. His way? That could mean popping up at her office without warning. Or maybe he'd have his assistant bombard her at all hours. Worse, he might twist the screws on her friends, using his influence to squeeze her from every angle Or he'd just invade her personal space-just like this, whenever he felt like it. Vincent had never been the type to let anything stand in his way-not when he wanted something badly enough.

She snapped, her tone sharp and trembling, "Vincent, this is coercion!"

His expression remained stone-cold, utterly remorseless as he gazed down at her. "You're not wrong. I am coercing you," he said evenly. "And you already know I'm not above getting my hands dirty if that's what it takes." He paused, letting the threat settle between them like static. "Think it over. My patience isn't limitless."

Vincent leaned in, just enough for his presence to become overwhelming, his dark, fathomless stare holding her captive.

A fraught silence stretched between them, heavy enough to smother the air.

At last, her fingers gave a barely perceptible twitch. Wordlessly,
At last, her fingers gave a barely perceptible twitch. Wordlessly,with an unmistakable stiffness, she tapped quickly across the screen of her phone.

In one brisk, unbroken gesture, she unlocked the device,navigated to the blocked contacts, and removed his number-purposefully tilting the screen so he could see.

Only after the task was finished did she look up, her gaze steady and unflinching. "Satisfied, Mr. Jones?"

His eyes dropped to the screen, and the rigid set of his shoulders finally loosened. "Three days. Seven o'clock.Cloudtop Restaurant. Don't keep me waiting." He spoke in an even,commanding tone.

Not sparing her another look, he pivoted smoothly, fingers closing around the door handle.

The door eased open on silent hinges, revealing Claude in the doorway.

Claude wore that signature, easygoing smile-only halfway in place, his hand suspended mid-knock. His lips parted. "Hannah ..." The greeting faltered, sticking halfway out as his eyes landed on the pair inside.

His gaze sharpened to a razor's edge, and all trace of warmth bled from his face, leaving behind a look as cold and dangerous as a drawn blade.
###Chapter 293 Used To His Care

Hannah's eyes widened with mild shock as she spotted Claude standing in the doorway.

Claude wore just the right amount of surprise on his face, his gaze briefly pausing on Vincent. "Mr. Jones? What a coincidence."

Vincent stood tall, his gaze glacial as he took in Claude's seemingly polite demeanor. "I wouldn't call it a coincidence."

Suddenly, the whole atmosphere felt thick with tension.

Hannah broke the silence by stepping forward and explaining in a calm voice, "Mr. Jones stopped in to check on Alice's condition."

A new look crossed Claude's face, as if everything had just clicked for him, though the smile he gave seemed colder than before.He studied Vincent, tone tinged with something deeper."So that's it. You really are a caring boss, Mr. Jones."

Just as quickly, Claude's tone changed, the words coming out almost too casually. "From what I've heard, Alice was already sent to the hospital. If you're that worried, maybe you should head over there instead." He lowered his voice, making his next statement feel even more pointed. "This is my girlfriend's private lounge. You shouldn't be here."

Hearing the word "girlfriend" made Vincent's features stiffen,and his eyes went cold. A small, cold smile tugged at his mouth."Are you telling me what to do?"

Vincent narrowed his eyes slightly. Apparently, his pressure on the Fontaine Galleria still wasn't getting the results he wanted.
Clanide gritted his teeth, and a muscle jumped in his temple. "L.wauld never presume."

An almost suffocating tension filled the room, and neither man looked willing to step down.

Hannah wasted no time moving forward, subtly positioning herself between them, her body angled protectively toward Claude. "Claude, did you want something from me?"

Immediately, the storm faded from Claude's eyes. He broke into a gentle smile, and his gaze softened as it met hers. "Ah.almost forgot."

A beautifully wrapped crystal box appeared in his hands. Inside,he revealed a bouquet of preserved roses with tiny diamnonds glinting among the petals. "A small present to celebrate your successful show," he said, eyes warm and sincere.

Surprise widened Hannah's eyes, and a smile formed on her lips.
"Thank you, Claude. This is beautiful. I really appreciate it."

Claude came closer and reached up to smooth a loose strand of hair behind her ear with a gentle touch.

Vincent took in the tender gesture, his jaw tightening and his eyes growing colder by the second. What made it even harder to accept was how Hannah offered no resistance. She did not push Claude away. She did not object to his touch. She almost seemed to lean into it, nervous but letting him get close.

Heat flickered in Vincent's gaze, but he dragged his eyes away As he turned to leave, his gaze fell on her feet. Her slender right ankle had a visible scrape-like it had been rubbed raw by the heeL

He let his eyes rest on the injury for a couple of seconds. A shadow crossed his face, making his thoughts unreadable.

Claude took notice right away. With one swift,purposeful step.
Claude took notice right away. With one swift, purposeful step,he moved into Vincent's line of sight and chimed in firmly, "Mr.Jones,isn't it time for you to leave?"

Hannah turned her eyes to Vincent.

That pulled Vincent out of his thoughts, and he jerked hisgaze away. Not sparing another glance at anyone, he spun on his heel and walked off, every step brisk and purposeful.

Reaching the end of the backstage hallway, Vincent paused,raised his hand, and summoned his bodyguard. He spoke in a short, firm tone. "Find the nearest pharmacy. Pick up sterile cotton swabs, an antiseptic spray, and waterproof bandages."

His bodyguard hesitated, surprised by the odd request.Vincent never bothered with small details like this. Still, the answer came swiftly. "Yes." With that, he hurried away.

Vincent remained where he was, his eyebrows pulled together and his fingers rubbing absently at the wedding ring on his finger. He could not shake the image of that scraped and swollen ankle, which only made his restlessness grow worse.

Within minutes, the bodyguard was back, holding out a neatly packed paper bag.

Vincent took it, giving the package a gentle squeeze. He did not let his face show anything and silently turned to head straight for Hannah's lounge. Once he got there, he found the door ajar, not fully closed.

Claude's gentle voice floated from inside, full of genuine worry."Take a look-your skin's broken and bleeding. Did you not realize it?"

Through the slim opening in the door, Vincent had a perfect view of everything that was happening.

There was Claude, kneeling right in front of Hannah.
Hannah sat on a chair, her right foot slightly raised.

Claude was cradling her heel with one hand, while using the other to gently dab a cotton pad-soaked in antiseptic-against the scraped skin of her ankle. Every movement was tender.

Her head dipped slightly as she watched what he was doing.Her face showed no tension, no flicker of protest. There was something quiet and yielding in her eyes. Not quite surrender -more like a tired familiarity with being cared for. She stayed still. No recoil. No hesitation. It was as if she was used to this kind of care-as if she'd grown to accept it.

A shadow flickered across Vincent's gaze-gone before it settled. He said nothing. He just turned and walked off.

A sharp thud echoed behind him as he tossed the paper bag into a nearby trash bin-without looking back.
###Chapter 294 He Would Be Hers


Vincent burst into the underground parking garage, fury blazing in his eyes.

He had almost reached his car when a frantic woman's scream suddenly broke through the silence. "Somebody help! Stay away from me! What do you think you're doing? Let me go!Stop it!"

Surrounded by four thugs, Erica was being pushed around and manhandled.Her blouse had been yanked out of place, her hair hung in messy strands, and she looked completely defenseless.

The thugs stank of booze and grime, yelling crude insults as they grabbed at her arms and tried to haul her toward a shadowy corner of the garage. One of them even reached down to tug at the edge of her skirt.

A flash of movement in her peripheral vision told Erica that Vincent was drawing near. A faint, satisfied smile appeared on her lips-her risk had paid off.

Spotting Vincent's car earlier had given her an idea. She'd quickly paid some local troublemakers to help her stage the perfect scene. She was certain Vincent would never just ignore it.

She didn't waste any thought on whether Vincent's real purpose here was to see Hannah. Right now, she cared only that she had captured his attention.

Vincent's stare turned colder than ice. Anger was already bubbling inside him. He lifted a hand, stopping his bodyguard from making a move.
None of the thugs realized what hit them.

In the blink of an eye, sharp cracks and heavy thuds rang out across the garage-fists meeting flesh, bone on bone, a brutal beat of violence.

In under sixty seconds, all four thugs lay motionless on the ground-their defeat precise, brutal, and without hesitation.

Vincent hadn't stepped in to save anyone. He had let something out. He looked completely unfazed. He stood there,a storm still churning in his eyes, now colder than ever after the release of rage.

Erica stared at the thugs, who were left groaning and sprawled across the ground. The fear on her face hadn't yet faded when her eyes widened at the sight of Vincent's ruthless efficiency.

Forcing down her unease, she quickly switched gears and plastered on a pitiful expression, her lips trembling, voice quivering as if about to cry. "V-Vincent! I'm so glad it's you.I -I just came to see Hannah's show, just to experience something new. After it was over, I was heading out when these men cornered me. I was terrified... I don't know what would've happened if you hadn't come."

Vincent put distance between them with a single step, offering no comfort at all. His words came out cold and clipped as he spoke to his bodyguards. "Take her home."

The reply came at once. "Yes." The bodyguards moved in to do as ordered.

All the color drained from Erica's face. She fixed her stare on Vincent's distant, frosty expression-and the trace of irritation that now shadowed his eyes.

Her teeth sank into her lower lip as she fought to force tears into her eyes. She managed a small, broken voice, heavy with hurt and uncertainty. "Vincent, are you still angry with me? I
hurt and uncertainty. "Vincent, are you still angry with me? I know I messed up before. I embarrassed myself and made you upset..."

That night, she hadn't even managed to get close to him. She couldn't understand why he was still so cold-why he had chosen to ignore her for so long.

No answer came from Vincent, not to her pleading or her tears.He declared with words as cold and final as ice, "Erica,remember where you stand. You're just my aunt in name."

He left no room for misunderstanding. There was no mistaking the sharp line he was drawing.

Erica's balance wavered just for a moment. His words had cut her deeply. Redness spread in her eyes, and her voice broke apart asshe pushed back with one last burst of desperation."You know we're not actually related by blood. We grew up together,Vincent! All those years-our whole childhood-don't you feel even the slightest bit of affection for me?"

She had grown up alongside Vincent and Brinley. Yet,she could never ignore how he always treated Brinley differently, a fact she had resented for as long as she could remember. But Brinley was locked up now. Being the only childhood sweetheart left behind, at least that was how she saw herself to him, she could not bring herself to accept that Vincent truly felt nothing at all for her.

He answered without the slightest hesitation-his reply as blunt as a blow, "Totally nothing."

Two words that carried every bit of finality she dreaded.

Erica couldn't move. Her face had gone completely pale, and thóugh her eyes shimmered with unshed tears, not a single one fell.

After several long seconds of silence, her lips slowly pulled into a twisted smile-uqlier than if she had simply cried: It was full
a twisted smile-uglier than if she had simply cried. It was full of bitterness and self-mockery. "Of course," she said in a voice just above a whisper. "Of course, you never saw me. No matter what I did, you never looked my way. You've always treated me like this... and I was never the exception."

Vincent didn't spare her another glance. "Take her back to the family estate," he instructed his bodyguards, his tone flat and final.

One of the bodyguards stepped forward at once and gestured with practiced civility. "This way, Ms. Stanton."

Erica trailed behind the bodyguard without a word, her body moving but her mind elsewhere. She climbed into the back seat.Vincent's voice was still in her ears, every word clinging to her like static.

Then, something shifted. Her lips curled, slow and certain, like a secret unfolding. It was fine. Once they were married,feelings could grow over time. She had waited through everything-his long divorce, Brinley's downfall, every delay and detour.Waiting a little longer didn't scare her. Eventually,he'd be hers. That was enough.
###Chapter 295 She Was The Suspect

The investigation into Alice's allergic reaction had hit a wall.

As pressure mounted from every direction, Hannah pressed the police to pick up the pace. She personally delivered every scrap of surveillance footage and every statement she'd managed to collect.

She'd braced herself for a drawn-out ordeal-days, maybe weeks, of combing through evidence before a suspect could be found.

But just a few hours later, her phone buzzed.

Officer Gavin Mercer, the lead investigator, was on the other end."Ms. Scott, we need you at the station right away. There's been a development-we've identified a main suspect, but we need your help to verify some details."

Gavin's words had carried an edge of urgency, clipped and unyielding.

After ending the call, Hannah wasted no time-she grabbed her keys and sped toward the precinct, heart pounding with restless curiosity. Who had they caught? Who could possibly be behind it all?

Stepping through the station doors, she was swallowed by an oppressive wave of tension.

A uniformed officer wordlessly/ gestured for her to follow. She trailed him through the sterile hallway. As they rounded a corner, a sudden, bloodcurdling shriek erupted from behind a glass-walled observation room, slicing through the hush.
"It wasn't me! Let me go! You're framing me! I didn't do anything-let me go,ahhh!"

Hannah stopped cold, her breath caught in her chest. That voice-it was unmistakable Daphne's. Alice's allergic reaction was caused by Daphne?

She whipped around, peering into the observation room through the glass.

Inside, Daphne sat slumped in a metal chair, wrists shackled,hair a wild tangle, her entire body trembling as two steely-eyed female officers pinned her in place.

Daphne's face was drained of all color, eyes bloodshot and brimming with tears, her cries growing more frantic as she struggled against the cuffs.

Right then, Gavin stepped out of a nearby office,his jaw set in a hard line as he caught Hannah's eye and offered a brief,heavy nod. "Ms. Scott, glad you made it."

Hannah tore her gaze away from Daphne. She faced Gavin,her voice thick with disbelief. "You're saying... Daphne is the suspect?"

Scenes from the surveillance footage raced through Hannah's mind-Daphne storming into the dressing room, eyes blazing with anger. Still, having Daphne pegged as the culprit was a shock Hannah hadn't seen coming.

Gavin gestured for her to follow him into a vacant office."She's our top lead right now," he explained. "What you turned in-especially the timeline-was critical. Daphne was the only one with a clear window alone in Alice's makeup room. She had almost a full minute in there with no one else around. All signs point to her as a prime suspect."

His delivery was brisk but precise, every word backed by evidence.
"Right now, she's emotionally all over the place. She denies any intentional poisoning-says she just lost her temper and broke a few things."

Hannah nodded and gave a succinct account of the previous night's events, filling in the details as Gavin questioned her.

When she stepped out into the hallway and passed the observation room, Daphne's eyes locked onto her. Instantly,Daphne flew into a fit of rage. "Hannah! You set meup! I hope you rot in hell!"

One of the femnale officers barked, "Miss Whitaker, this is a police station! Pull yourself together!"

"Pull myself together? How am I supposed to stay calm when she's out to ruin my life?" Daphne screamed, her voice trembling as she jabbed an accusing finger at Hannah. "She set me up! She wants to destroy me, all because I lost my temper and broke a couple of things? She set the whole trap to frame me! Officers, what are you waiting for? She's the real criminal here-arrest her!"

Hannah halted in her tracks, her exhaustion vanishing beneath a flash of icy outrage.

"Framing you?" A cold laugh escaped her lips. "If I'd wanted to take you down, the single backstage slap would've been the least of your problems. With the evidence of you trashing the dressing room and causing a public disturbance, you'd already be behind bars by now. You really think you'd still be here,screaming your head off at me?"

Her eyes narrowed, voice slicing through the chaos. "And let's not forget-you triggered Alice's allergic reaction. She could've died, That's not just some petty outburst. That's intentional harm. You have any idea how many years you could get for that?"

Daphne recoiled, unnerved by Hannah's intimidating presence.
Daphne recoiled, unnerved by Hannah's intimidating presence."It wasn't me... I swear, I didn't hurt anyone..." Her voice trailed off as she spotted Miles striding in her direction, desperation flickering across her face. "Miles! Please, you have to help me!"

Hannah followed Daphne's pleading gaze and spotted Miles closing in.

His expression was unyielding as he cut her off. "That's enough.Look around-you're in a police station."

It was clear he'd heard her entire outburst just now.

Daphne's words died on her lips.

Miles's voice was low and firm as he turned to the man behind him. "Mr. Fraser, she's yours." Then, with calm finality, he added, "Daphne, from this point on, you'll follow Mr. Fraser's instructions. You caused this mess. Deal with it. No one can clean it up for you."

Crushed by the assumption that her brother abandoned her,
Daphne watched her brother with disbelief, her eyes glistening.She mouthed his name in a trembling whisper, "Miles..."

Two female officers took Daphne by the arms,escorting her down the hallway. Elliot Fraser kept pace just behind.

Miles lingered a moment and then faced Hannah. Exhaustion shadowed his features. "Ms. Scott, can we speak for a minute?"
###Chapter 296 | Guessed | Misjudged You


In a quiet corner of a café, Miles gave his coffee a gentle stir. After setting his spoon down with a faint clink,he released a quiet sigh. "I owe you an apology,Ms. Scott."

His eyes settled on Hannah's calm expression. "My sister acted recklessly and caused you a lot of trouble."

Hannah lifted her cup and took a sip. She didn't avoid the subject-her voice remained steady as she met his gaze and nodded. "Yes, your sister did cause me quite a great deal of trouble."

She paused only briefly before adding, "Still, I accept your apology, Mr. Whitaker."

Her directness caught Miles off guard. When their eyes met again, his eyes softened with the budding appreciation for her honesty. "I thought you'd just tell me about you being unfazed or something like that."

Placing her cup on the table, Hannah met his gaze, her lips curving with the hint of a smile. "Working wvith someone like you, I don't think there's any reason to waste time on empty courtesies."

Something in her frankness resonated wih him. Leaning back, he looked out the window at the busy street,lost for a moment in thought. His words came out softer, almost as if confessing to himself. "Daphne was spoiled. That's on me."

A deep breath steadied him before he continued, "My dad died young, so my mother had to raise me and Daphne alone. Daphne was a considerate kid back then, right up until something happened..."

Regret colored his features as he recalled the past. "She changed after that."

Hannah listened quietly, saying nothing.

"Impulsiveness and recklessness took over," Miles remarked, his tone more serious now. A wry smile crossed his lips. "Over,the years, as long as her mistakes weren't too serious or illegal, I kept cleaning up for her. And I ended up spoiling her even more."

He leaned forward, his tone firm. "But I still believe she isn't a bad person."
Hannah said nothing. After a while, she raised her head and locked eyes with him. She posed the most crucial question. "Mr. Whitaker, by explaining all of this, are you trying to tell me that Daphne had nothing to do with what happened to Alice?" She leaned forward slightly, her voice measured.

Miles answered right away, "Yes. It wasn't Daphne's doing. That's not something she's capable of."

Hannah took a moment to study his face. She thought back to Daphne's terrified expression when she was taken,away, to the way she'd reacted when confronted-it hadn't looked like an act.

After sipping her coffee again, Hannah finally broke the silence."To be honest, I don't believe it was her either."

So many strange things had happened all at once-from the abrupt fire to Alice's allergic reaction.Everything seemed tangled together, as if someone wanted to stop her store from ever opening.

A flash of surprise appeared in Miles's eyes when he heard her say that. A soft laugh escaped him."I thought you'd hate Daphne."

After all, Daphne had never tried to hide her dislike for Hannah-she went so far as to wreck Hannah's makeup room and almost ruined the entire show.

Hannah's eyebrow arched ever so slightly. With a playful glint in her eyes and the hint of a smile, she replied,"Do you honestly see me as the kind of person who'd let emotion get the better part of them?"

The gentle teasing eased the tension that had lingered between them.

Miles looked a little taken aback by her response. He studied her clear, steady gaze before giving a slight shake of his head. "I guess I misjudged you."

Sincerity colored every word.

Their eyes met, and a brief, unspoken smile passed between them.

Miles set down his cup; feeling unexpectedly more relaxed.

Thinking of the video he'd watched the night before, he spoke, his voice carrying genuine praise. "I caught the closing walk at Metamorphosis. It was incredible."
Hannah accepted his compliment with grace. "Thank you."

A moment later, she added, "And I appreciated the flowers you sent. They were lovely."

Miles kept his eyes on hers, though another image pushed its way to the front of his mind-Claude by her side at last night's event. His own company's recent troubles meant that most of what he knew about Hannah came from news articles and internet posts.

Miles hesitated for a second before speaking, trying to sound casual, though there was a curiosity he could not quite hide. "Claude Hobbes... People keep talking about you and him online. Is he really your boyfriend?"

Hannah's easy smile slipped just a little. She met his gaze and replied, "How long has it been since we sat down and had a nice conversation, Mr. Whitaker? You're actually here gossiping about my relationships now?"
###Chapter 297 A Mutual Enemy


Miles quickly realzed he might've overstepped. He gave a quiet explanation. "Just curious, that's all."

Maybe it was the laid-back vibe that had given him the courage to ask, and the question had been out before he could stop himself. Regret had come immediately as he knew he shouldn't have been nosy.

Hannah met his eyes for a moment before looking down. She didn't mind clarifying. Her fingers traced the rim of her mug as she answered, voice steady, "Claude is not my boyfriend. He is the son my parents adopted many years ago. We basically grew up as siblings." She paused, letting the words sink in. "But eventually,hisreal family came for him, and we only got back in touch recently."

She glanced up at Miles. "Claude's like a brother to me, nothing more."

Miles arched an eyebrow, piecing things together, though something didn't quite add up. "Then how come..."

"You're wondering why he's declared he is my boyfriend?" Hannah caught on instantly, a faint smile slipping onto her face. "At that time, there were some nasty rumors about me. People said I was his mistress or something. Claude hated hearing that, so he announced that I was his girlfriend. The gossip died down after that.He's just..."

She paused, searching for the right words.′′Once Claude decides on something, he never looks back. A good heart, but reckless."

The memory of Vincent's expression that day popped into her mind-he'd been absolutely livid when he found out about her being Claude's "girlfriend." The thought brought a faint smile to her lips.

Miles was still trying to wrap his head around it."Didn't that bother you?" After all, she suddenly gained a "boyfriend" out of nowhere.

She just smiled, brushing it off. "It was a bit abrupt, sure. Took me a while to get used to it. But in some ways, it saves me a lot of trouble." Especially when it came to Vincent. Even now, knowing how he felt, she still couldn't figure him out.

She ended the topic with a quiet insistence. "Anyway, Claude is like family to me. That's all there is to it."

Yet, Miles couldn't shake off the memory of Claude's eyes on Hannah during that day at the auction.He took a slow sip of his coffee and mumbled just above a whisper, "Didn't look very brotherly from where I was sitting..."

Hannah angled her head, clearly missing what he'd said. "Hmm? Did you say something?"

"It's nothing." Miles brushed it aside. His voice turned firm. "That allergy episode with Alice? I doubt it's as straightforward as it seems. We should keep each other in the loop. Pass along anything new you discover."

He studied her, his gaze sharpening. "Whoever set this up wasn't just after Alice. Daphne got caught in the crossfire, too. The real question is, who's the actual target?"

Was this really about Daphne? Or was someone coming after Hannah? Miles couldn't quiet the whirlwind of questions spinning in his head.

Hannah's expression grew sharper, every trace of warmth gone. Deep down, her instincts told her-this was all aimed at her.

Meanwhile, inside a cramped holding cell at the precinct, Daphne was curled up on the stiff plastic chair,nerves stretched thin with each echoing step outside. Every sound set her on edge, convinced the officers were coming to interrogate her again. Ever since Elliot had left, she'd felt completely abandoned.

A female officer's voice broke through the tense silence. "Ms. Whitaker, you've got a visitor."

Daphne's head jerked up, a spark of hope flickering in her tired eyes. Her mind jumped straight to her brother. Surely, he'd come to take her home.

She practically stumbled toward the door, heart thudding. But as it creaked open and a shadow crossed the threshold, her hopeful look vanished. It wasn't Miles. In walking was a woman she didn't recognize.

It was none other than Erica.Word had already reached her that Daphne was being set up to take the fall, a scapegoat. Daphne had no idea who this woman was. She instinctively stepped back, eyes wary. "Who are you?"

Erica's lips curved into a gentle smile as she settled into a chair. "That's not important. What matters is-I'm here to help you."

"Help me?" Daphne clutched at the hem of her shirt, her voice climbing in pitch. "I don't even know you.Why would you help me?"

Erica remained unfazed by the wariness, her pleasant smile never fading. "It doesn't matter. The important thing is-we have a mutual enemy."

"Enemy?" Daphne's brows knit together, confusion clear. "Who are you talking about?"

Erica leaned in, her eyes sharp and steady as she pronounced the name slowly and clearly. "Hannah Scott."

Daphne went rigid, stunned by the name. "You also hate her? Why?" The question tumbled out, all her nerves on edge.

With practiced poise, Erica folded her legs and leaned forward, her voice dipping to a confidential whisper.
"Why do I despise her?" A soft laugh escaped her. "I just don't want to see her doing well."

Reaching into her purse, Erica pulled out a photograph and handed it over.

Daphne hesitated, but her curiosity won out. She took, studied the photo, and then her whole body froze,shock spreading across her face. With trembling hands, she latched onto Erica's wrist. "What can you do to help me?"

Erica's words flowed smoothly, sweet and persuasive. "As long as you listen to me."
###Chapter 298 The Ulcer Strikes


Business was booming at VelaCore-the aftershocks of the lingerie show still sending waves through the store. The floor bustled with eager shoppers, and every staff member moved with a sense of urgency, arms full and smiles barely contained.

From the fourth-floor gallery, Hannah lingered at the railing, her gaze sweeping the vibrant scene below. She let a satisfied smile play/ on her lips, savoring the energy crackling through the air.

Someone called her name, warm and steady, "Hannah."

Claude had materialized at her side, drawn in as soon as he'd heard she was in the building.

His smile was calm, perfectly curated for the moment. "The whole store feels electric.Congratulations-the show was a real triumph."

She turned to himn, her own smile gentle but genuine. "Thank you, Claude. I owe a lot to you. I never could've pulled this off alone."

She knew Claude's influence had woven through every phase of Metamorphosis, his connections and resources proving invaluable.

He stepped closer, his presence casually encroaching on her space. His eyes drifted, landing on the phone she'd placed on the gallery's railing.

The screen glowed with an unread message. "Emergency meeting added. Dinner was pushed back 30minutes. Be there on time." Vincent's name was front and center.

Claude's smile flickered, barely perceptible, before he masked it beneath practiced calm. Dinner plans with Vincent?

He forced himself to hold the smile, just a heartbeat too long, his jaw tightening as he looked away-studying the bustling crowd below as if it demanded his attention.
"Your new feature piece looks incredible down there," he remarked, chin lifting toward the display. His voice was even, but a subtle edge crept in. "That design... definitely takes guts."

Unaware of the shift in his mood, Hannah followed his line of sight. "Yeah, our designer really nailed it this season," she said, letting a casual note slip into her voice.

She scooped up her phone, skimmed the message on the glowing screen, tapped out a brisk reply, and then tucked it away without missing a beat.

Claude's sharp eyes missed nothing. Her reply to Vincent's message hit him hard: she was planning to see Vincent. Jealousy burned through him, quick and silent.

Hannah checked her watch and then offered him a brisk, professional smile. "I've still got a few things to sort out in the store. Claude, catch you later."

His response stayed perfectly cordial. "Of course. Don't let me keep you."

As soon as she turned the corner, the last trace of warmth vanished from his expression. His jaw tightened,and his eyes hardened to steel.

Storming back to his office, Claude's entire demeanor shifted in aninstant-like flicking off a light. The door clicked shut behind him, sealing away any hint of softness.

A violent crash split the air-he flung his coffee cup across the room, sending porcelain shards skittering across the floor.

He snatched up the pen holder next, hurling it so hard against the wall that pens rained down in every direction.

With a sweep of his arm, he sent stacks of carefully organized documents flying, scattering papers like a burst of feathers.

Within seconds, the office atmosphere shattered into wild disorder.

Claude braced himself against the desk, shoulders hunched, breath ragged-each inhale sharp with barely contained rage.
He had clawed his way to the very top of Fontaine Galleria, commanding respect and envy in equal measure -yet somehow, in Hannah's life, he still came second to Vincent. How could he accept it?

A sharp knock interrupted his brooding. On the other side of the door, his assistant Owen Huxley's voice filtered in, tentative and careful. "Mr. Hobbes? Your antacid just arrived, and I also had some soup brought up. You should eat something while it's still warm-you skipped lunch today."

Claude's punishing work ethic was infamous-so relentless that skipping meals had long since become routine. The years of neglect had left him with a chronic ulcer, a price he barely acknowledged.

Owen walked in, placing the medicine and the soup on Claude's desk.

Claude didn't bother answering. Instead, his hand shot out-not to take the soup, but to shove it violently aside.

The container struck the plush carpet with a heavy thud, splashing soup everywhere.

Owen recoiled, his eyes widening in alarm.

Claude's attention zeroed in on the blister pack of pills lying amid the mess. Not missing a beat, he snatched it up and, with a flick of his wrist, hurled the brand-new pack of stomach meds straight into the wastebasket. The gesture was swift, final.

"Mr. Hobbes!" Owen's voice cracked as he paled. "You can't just blow off your medication-especially with your condition!"

Claude's posture wavered, just for a heartbeat, before he leveled a frigid stare at Owen. "That's exactly what I'm going to do."

His gaze lingered on Owen's tense face, cold and unwavering, before he tossed out. "Be sure Ms. Scott 'accidentally' finds out my ulcer strikes."

Claude's jaw tightened as he bit out the word"accidentally." "Bring me a bottle of liquor. The strongest you've got," he added, his tone brooking no argument.

"Right away." Owen kept his head down, offering no protest as he dispatched the janitor to handle the wreckage.

Then,following Claude's orders, Owen quietly sent two employees from Fontaine Galleria over to Hannah's store.During idle conversation, they"casually" dropped that Claude's stomach condition had flared up again-worse than ever-and that he was flat-out refusing his medication.

Upon learning this, Hannah tried to reach Claude several times, but every call went unanswered. Anxious,she abandoned everything and hurried to his office. The instant she stepped inside, her breath caught in her throat-Claude lay curled up on the couch, soaked in cold sweat, barely clinging to consciousness.

Hannah didn't hesitate. She gathered him in her arms and rushed him straight to the hospital, the dinner arrangement she'd made with Vincent vanishing from her mind entirely.
###Chapter 299 In A Hotel Room


Vincent fastened his last cufflink, catching his reflection in the gleaming dressing mirror. This afternoon,Hannah's one-word reply-"Okay"-had calmed a bit of the irritation that had crept in when he had to postpone their dinner.

The emergency meeting had proved to be a slog, more brutal than his expectation. He'd powered through each setback with relentless, almost surgical precision, steamrolling any hint of resistance.

By seven, he finally stepped into Cloudtop Restaurant.

He didn't claim his seat right away. Instead, he took a beat to suvey the table he'd orchestrated to perfection: Burgundy wine breathing in its decanter, a menu fine-tuned to her every favorite, a vase spilling over with fresh yellow roses. Even the cellist he'd requested was tuning up, ready to play the pieces Hannah loved most.

Tonight, beneath the gentle wash of cello music, he'd ask her to marry him again.

He checked his watch-7:02.Still early.

Oddly, his palms were slick with sweat. He stared down, a dry laugh slipping from him. Nervous? Absolutely.A trace of ridiculous anticipation stirred in his chest, but he quickly dismissed it as meaningless.

He kept murmuring to himself, "No big deal."

Whether she liked him or loved him-none of it was supposed to matter. What counted were the five years that had shaped them, and Hannah herself.

Only with Hannah by his side did Vincent feel like the master of his universe. Without her, the world spun out of his grasp. She needed to return to the orbit he'd painstakingly drawn around them both.

Claude-her so-called boyfriend-was nothing more than an unwelcome splinter under his skin. If she slipped the ring on tonight and signed his carefully rewritten remarriage agreement-guaranteeing her every right-Claude would become nothing but a ridiculous joke. Vincent let out a measured breath, fingertips drifting over the chilled rim of his glass.

He mentally walked through his plan again and again, unwilling toleave even the smallest detail to chance.

When she arrived, he'd welcome her with a cup of jasmine tea, its delicate steam curling in the soft light.

The first appetizer would appear just as the cellist struck the opening notes of her favorite piece,"Moonlight."

By the time the main course reached its peak, the waiter would quietly present a bouquet of yellow roses,still beaded with dew.

Dessert would follow, light and exquisite, and as the last plate was whisked away, he'd finally reveal the ring -along with the remarriage agreement.

He orchestrated each step like orchestrating a high-stakes negotiation, ensuring nothing could go wrong.

But time slid by in slow, deliberate drips. Each minute seemed to stretch until it nearly snapped.

Seven-thirty. She still hadn't appeared.

Vincent nursed his wine, each sip doing little to soothe the restless tension building in his chest.

Seven forty-five crept past. Still, no sign of her.

He unlocked his phone-no messages waiting.

His thumb poised over Hannah's contact, the urge to call her almost overwhelming. But he forced himself to wait-he couldn't let impatience show, not tonight.

By eight o'clock, her absence weighed on him like a stone.

Across the dining room, the manager offered another cautious nod, silently asking if they were supposed to bring out the main course.

Vincent's jaw tightened as he waved the manager off-just waiting for a little longer.

His mood had already soured, every trace of earlier anticipation replaced by displeasure.
When the clock struck eight ten, the only thing that had arrived was the cold certainty settling in his bones.

Vincent's patience finally snapped. He seized his phone, thumb slamming the call button with a sharp, pent-up urgency.

Ring. No answer.

He tried again, jaw clenched tight-still nothing.

He called a third time, a fourth, stubborn hope giving way to mounting agitation as each attempt went unanswered.

Soon,he was caught in a compulsive loop, redialing with manic persistence.

By the time the call counter ticked past thirty, his hand trembled, and the silence on the other end felt deafening.

The name "Hannah" blazed across his phone, searing into his vision.

On the thirty-third try, the call finally went through.

Vincent didn't hesitate-he nearly shouted, "Hannah! Where are you..."

But a breathy, ambiguous noise cut him off. A man's labored breathing spilled from the other end, rough and far too intimate.

"Anna, you're so soft," the man groaned, voice thick with satisfaction."Mm...Oh..."

Was that voice... Claude's? Vincent's mind detonated. Every nerve in his body seemed to snap and catch fire, his pulse rocketing skyward-then plunging into a numb, ice-cold void.

A cold, merciless fist clenched tight around Vincent's heart. "Where are you? Where the hell are you?" he demanded, his voice raw and trembling with barely-contained fury.

Claude answered, his tone sultry and heavy with satisfaction, "Hmm? Mr. Jones, is that you? Ah... So you heard everything?"

Vincent's hand nearly crushed the phone. "I'm asking where you are!"
Claude's laughter oozed through the line, each word a calculated provocation. "Where do you think,Vincent? Just a man and a woman, alone in a hotel room. Doing what couples do. Isn't that perfectly normal? Anna, don't mind him. Let's not stop."

With a taunting click, the call cut off.
###Chapter 300 Find Her


That was it. The last thread of Vincent's sanity snapped.

Vincent stood rigid, dead center in the lavish, candlelit eatery. The sickening echoes of muffled moans from the line rang in his memory, punctuated by Claude's offhanded, venomous remark, "Just a man and a woman, alone in a hotel room."

Silence pressed in on him from all sides.

Vincent was livid. No messages. No explanation. Hannah had stood him up to meet Claude-and at a hotel,no less. To think about all his efforts put into tonight's dinner arrangement. The wait he'd endured, his expectation, his attempts to salvage their relationship-it was all a pathetic joke.

With a guttural roar, he grabbed the table's edge and flung it with reckless force.

Crash! Splinters of glass and splashes of scarlet wine drenched the rich, velvety rug.

Vincent stood in the wreckage, his chest heaving, fury radiating off him in suffocating waves.

He didn't spare the destruction a single glance. Picking up his phone, he ignored the wine smearing the screen and jabbed Derek's contact.

The call connected almost instantly.

"Mr. Jones?" Derek's voice teetered on bewilderment.

Vincent's words rasped out low and raw, each word a shard of ice. "Get the word out. All Jones Group hotels in Dorbarrow-lock the doors for the night. And I mean every single one of them."

The line went silent for a second.

"W-What?" Derek sputtered, disbelief flooding his voice. He stumbled for clarity, calculations piling fast."Mr. Jones, you have to reconsider! That's an operational breach! Halting all functions abruptly with zero context will trigger chaos. We'll bleed revenue, and we're talking over ten million just from core properties alone, not to mention the displaced guests, the corporate contracts, the damage to our brand..."

"Track her down," Vincent cut in, the phrase slicing clean through Derek's protest.

Vincent was determined to locate Hannah. She owed him an explanation-and he'd get it, regardless of the fallout.

The silence on the other end was heavy.

Derek, though shaken, quickly grasped the reason behind Vincent's unreasonable orders. HHe'd already heard about the commotion at the Cloudtop Restaurant. He knew exactly who"her"was. After a moment,his voice returned, bleak and burdened. "Understood."

Ten minutes later, Vincent tore through Dorbarrow's main stretch in a sleek, high-performance sports car,its engine howling.

Then, his phone rang with an incoming call. It was Derek.

"Mr. Jones, the directive's in motion. Units are pulling guests out-we've initiated shutdown," Derek reported tensely. "We're already clocking fifteen million in losses, and that number's rising fast." He hesitated. "And we haven't located her yet."

Vincent didn't blink, his hold on the wheel unshaken. His gaze was dark, a storm held behind his irises."Alright," he muttered, voice flat and unreadable. The financial impact registered as background noise.

Then, like a blade to the chest-a gut-twisting thought: what if the call was fake? What if Hannah's phone was with someone else?

He crushed the gas pedal, the engine shrieking as the car bolted ahead. He darted through the lanes,ignoring horns and screeches as he surged forward. He had to get there. Faster. He just had to be faster.

He screeched to a halt in front of Sterling Heights-Hannah's apartment building. The tires wailed against the asphalt. He killed the engine.

The roar died, plunging the world into an abrupt, ringing silence.

Vincent was out in a heartbeat, marching toward the entrance.
The elevator pinged, and he barreled down the hallway. He skipped the bell and slammed his fist against the door.

Thump. Thump. Thump. The pounding echoed ominously down the corridor.

Then, he heard it, footsteps approaching from inside. His lungs seized. Hannah hadn't gone anywhere.A wave of dizzying relief washed over him. The call had been a lie. Claude had lied. His jaw unclenched,just a little.

The lock clicked. The door swung open. But it wasn't Hannah.It was Margaret.

The fragile hope flickered out in an instant, replaced by ice and hollowness.

Margaret's drowsiness faded fast, replaced by irritation and suspicion. "Why are you here?"

He said nothing, eyes fixed behind her. Before she could intercept, he brushed past her, shoulders tense.

"Hey! What do you think you're doing?" Margaret's voice spiked, but Vincent didn't acknowledge her,striding toward Hannah's room.

He gripped the handle and twisted hard, flinging the door wide.

The room was empty.

He froze, a sharp smile curling bitterly across his face. What a fool he was. He'd actually thought she'd be there.

"Have you invaded enough?" Margaret's voice trembled with fury. "Get out. Now!"

Vincent rotated slowly, throat bobbing as he forced out a dry, pained, "Sorry."

As he turned to leave, Raymond, roused by the noise, emerged from his room. "What happened?"

"Don't ask me," Margaret snapped, still glaring at Vincent. "Some lunatic barged in past midnight and scared me half to death!"
###Chapter 301 His Scheme


Claude straightened in the hospital bed, his skin still tinged with the pallor from the earlier treatment, but he was much better.

The IV line dripped steadily, sending a slow, cold trickle of medication into his arm.

His mind drifted back, unbidden, to what had happened just a few hours ago.

At that time, Hannah had left the ward for a pharmacy run for his sake, her phone abandoned on the nightstand.

Suddenly, her phone had buzzed to life. The caller ID had flashed: Vincent.

A predatory glimmer had sparked in Claude's eyes as a razor-edged scheme unfurled in his mind. Without a hint of hesitation, he snatched up his own phone and navigated to a hidden, encrypted folder, his fingers moving with slick familiarity.

In moments, he had unearthed a certain audio file-a recording captured by accident ages ago, muffled and murky,but the suggestive voices were unmistakable. It was exactly the weapon he needed.

Then, Hannah's phone had vibrated with another incoming call from Vincent.

Claude had drawn a steadying breath and then dropped his voice to a lazy, teasing rasp, deliberately lacing each word with the hazy afterglow of sex.

He'd tapped play on the old audio file, angling both phones before the call connected so the recorded soundtrack would bleed perfectly into the line.

Then, bringing Hannah's device to his lips, he'd drawled, his voice taunting, "Mr. Jones? Heard enough?"

Vincent's furious outburst had erupted from the speaker-each syllable a jolt of satisfaction to Claude.

With a deep, almost wild chuckle bubbling in his chest, Claude pulled himself back from the memory.
Still restless, Claude snatched up the remote and flicked on the television, letting the chaos of breaking city news fill the sterile hospital room.

"Here's the freshest scoop in the world of business and corporate news. Tonight, all luxury hotels and resorts under the Jones Group umbrella have closed their doors with no warning, citing 'urgent investigations into serious safety hazards.' Entire hotels cleared out in minutes. Guests were shoved onto the curb in the middle of the night. High-stakes corporate events and million-dollar events-cancelled,just like that. The city's hospitality sector has plunged into chaos. Economists are already calling the impact catastrophic."

The headline splashed across the screen in bold, accusatory letters. "Jones Group's Hotel Operations Halt Nationwide-Mystery at the Core."

The anchor leaned in, her tone edged with intrigue. "Jones Group has yet to issue any official explanation.According to anonymous staffers, the shutdown order came straight from the very top. Some market analysts are whispering about a brutal internal power struggle. Others insist it's the result of a confidential investigation. For now, the truth is anyone's guess. We'll bring you updates as this story unfolds."

Claude didn't blink. The glow of the TV flickered in his eyes as an uncontrollably smug smile tugged at his lips. A cruel grin spread across his lips, its darkness steeped in the thrill of revenge and the satisfaction of striking true. Vincent, that maniac. He never imagined Vincent would unravel so completely, all for the sake of tracking down Hannah.

How unfortunate... His tongue flicked across his cracked lips, and a flash of annoyance crept into his gaze.lf only he could have seen Vincent's expression with his own eyes.

Just then, the hospital room door swung open, and Hannah stepped inside, her arms cradling a thermal container that steamed faintly with the promise of warm food and soup.

She set it down gently on the table and glanced over at Claude, her eyes brimming with concern."Are you feeling any better?" she asked, her voice soft as she nudged the container closer.

Claude still looked pale, but he managed a thin smile. "I'm okay now."

"Here. Have a little something to eat," she urged, pressing the container into his hands.
He took it and drank a few mouthfuls of the soup before managing a quiet, grateful smile."|′warm...can't remember the last time I've felt this kind of warmth."

Hannah froze, quietly watching him.

He turned away, fixing his gaze on the window, his voice dropping to a vulnerable murmur. "I can't stand hospitals. Ever since the Hobbes family took me back in, any time illness struck, it had always been the housekeeper or staff who hovered at my bedside. My parents? They brushed it off as weakness, too caught up in their grand affairs to take care of me. I had to battle through it all on my own."

A bitter edge crept into his words. "I learned early on that I couldn't let them down, and that if I wanted to prove to be worthy of the Hobbes name, I had to excel at everything. I wasn't allowed to show pain or admit l was tired. Being sick just meant wasting time."

His hands fidgeted with the edge of the blanket as he went on, quieter, almost to himself. "If my stomach hurt so badly that I couldn't sleep, I'd just swallow another round of painkillers. Then, I'd get up the next morning, suit perfectly pressed, and drag myself to meetings and parties. I drank, I struck business deal,and I kept moving like nothing could touch me-like I was built for it."

He exhaled. "In the Hobbes family, appearances mattered more than anything. No matter how much pain you were in, you had to keep smiling, pretending nothing was wrong."

Hannah's mind drifted to the doctor's earlier warning-that Claude had come dangerously close to a gastric perforation. The weight of it made her. voice gentler, more serious."So that's how your condition gets this bad?"

Logically speaking, those blessed with a wealthy background wouldn't have a body this broken down.

"Yeah." Claude let out a hollow laugh, the sound trailing off as fatigue crept into his features.

He raised his eyes to hers, searching. "Could you bring me home?"

Hannah hesitated, her,hand tightening around the thermal container. "You mean Sterling Heights? It's too late-my parents have already gone to bed."

Claude shook his head, his gaze steady. "Not your place. Mine." For just a moment, all the bravado slipped away. Something achingly fragile surfaced in his eyes-a desperate, wordless plea.
###Chapter 302 Stay The Night


In the end, Hannah couldn't bring herseIf to turn Claude down. She finished the discharge paperwork in a rush and drove Claude back to his place.

She'd.never been to Claude's house before.

When the car rolled to a stop, Hannah stepped out and carefully helped Claude to his feet.

Waiting outside the mansion, a butler immediately approached, ready to lend a hand. "Are you alright,Mr.Hobbes? Do you need any-"

Claude shook his head, brushing off the offer with a gentle smile and leaning in closer to Hannah. "No need.Anna's got me covered."

Assuming Claude just felt more comfortable with her, Hannah supported him inside, guiding him through the front doors.

She helped Claude settle onto the big leather sofa in the living room.

The butler silently brought over a glass of water and set down some medicine on the table.

Worry flickered across Hannah's face as she crouched down by the sofa. "Claude, is your stomach hurting again?"

"No, I'm quite happy," Claude replied, reclining into the sofa, seemingly more relaxed.

His eyes drifted to the living room clock. It was already past midnight.

He withdrew his gaze and, as if naturally, reached out to gently hold Hannah's hand as she was about to pull it back. "It's late, Anna," he murmured, voice low. "Why don't you just stay the night?"

For a moment, Hannah hesitated, uncertainty flickering across her face."I really shouldn't... I have my car and can drive myself home. It's okay, really," she replied softly."But I'm the one who's recovering, remember?" Claude countered, his voice laced with that particular blend of playful insistence and entitled charm. "Patients get special privileges. My call."

"But really, it's not convenient at all. Besides, I..." Hannah started to protest, about to say she hadn't brought a change of clothes or how staying over might look. But the way Claude looked at her, so hopeful, made her second-guess voicing her concerns.

"There's nothing inconvenient about it!" Claude seized the moment of her hesitation to make the decision for her. "Listen to me, it's settled! Butler!"

The butler, who'd been quietly waiting in the background, stepped forward with practiced grace. "Yes, Mr.Hobbes?"

"Prepare the nicest guest room now! Treat it like the master bedroom! Actually, go clean up the one at the end of the hall, with the big balcony. Put fresh velvet bedding on the bed, the set from the last auction that hasn't been used yet. Get the humidifier going." His instructions came out rapid-fire, each order crisp and precise, sounding nothing like a patient recovering from illness.

"At once, Mr. Hobbes." The butler gave a short bow and hurried off to carry out the preparations.

With everything handled, Claude shot Hannah a smug, satisfied look, leaving her no room to argue. She could only sigh and accept the situation. It was just one night, she reassured herself. No big deal.

Finding a moment of quiet, Hannah sat beside Claude and pulled out her phone to text her parents about her change of plans.

Unlocking her screen, she was immediately greeted by a news flash-"Jones Group Shuts Down Hotels Across the Country!"

Confused, she tapped to read more. What was Vincent doing now? He'd always been decisive, but this was the first time she'd seen him take such a risky approach in business.

Then, her eyes widened, her phone displayed "33 missed calls," all from Vincent. Only then did she remember: she was supposed to meet Vincent for dinner tonight.

She glanced at the time. Seven-thirty! Now, the clock had crept well past midnight. Nearly four hours had slipped away!

On instinct, Hannah hit redial, holding her phone tightly to her ear. One ring. Two. Straight to voicemail.

Hannah hesitated and then decided not to call again. Vincent disliked being kept waiting. She remembered a time a client had arrived just ten minutes late, and Vincent had canceled a billion-dollar deal without hesitation. There was no way he'd still be waiting around for her.

She decided to find an opportunity to apologize. One missed call wasn't worth agonizing over. After all the stress she'd endured over little things, she owed herself some peace. She had suffered enough from overthinking in the past.

A surprising calm settled over Hannah as she set her phone down. She slowly lowered the hand holding the phone.

Claude, watching her closely, picked up on her mood. He asked, as if he didn't know about the missed dinner arrangement between her and Vincent, "Is something bothering you? Did something happen?"

Hannah mustered a small smile. "It's nothing serious."

Just then, the butler returned to announce that the guest room was ready.

Feeling drained, Hannah let Claude know she was turning in for the night.

The butler stepped aside with quiet respect as Claude rose from the sofa, loosening the top buttons of his shirt. "Is everything in order?" he asked.

With a polite bow, the butler replied,"A∥is prepared exactly as you requested."
###Chapter 303 He Wanted To Leave His Mark


The butler's earlier remark about having prepared the room had actually meant outfitting Hannah's room with discreet, high-end surveillance cameras.

That particular order had come straight from Claude on their drive back.

At last, a shadow of satisfaction played across Claude's lips. "Good. Now bring Hannah a glass of water.
Make sure it's tampered with the substance that helps people sleep soundly. The stronger, the better."

He lingered over the wòrd "soundly," his gaze dark and unreadable.

"Understood, Mr. Hobbes," the butler responded, bowing before slipping away.

Once the butler was gone, Claude didn't go back to his own bedroom. Instead, he slipped into a secluded chamber buried deep within the mansion, a room brimming with state-of-the-art electronics.

He strode to the large, custom-built control station, unlocked it with a fingerprint, and watched as the enormous curved monitor split into four crystal-clear feeds from different viewpoints.

There, in perfect detail, was Hannah. She'd changed into the silk pajamas the butler had laid out, her hair still damp from a recent shower.

The sound of the butler's knock, followed by his offer of water, came through clearly.

On screen, Hannah answered the door and accepted the glass.

Claude inched closer, barely breathing.

She raised the glass to her lips and drank.

First sip.

Then another.

Half the water in the glass was already gone.
Claude's tense jaw finally slackened, and he exhaled slowly, relief and anticipation mingling in his eyes.

He started silently ticking off the minutes, his attention glued to Hannah's every mnove on the screen.

By the time twenty minutes had slipped by, she was out cold.

"Perfect." A murmur of satisfaction, low and rough, escaped Claude, possessive, dark, entirely too pleased.

Quiet'as a shadow, he rose from his chair and slipped away, making his way to Hannah's room with practiced stealth.

Hannah lay sprawled peacefuly across the wide bed, her breathing even and undisturbed.

Taking a seat on the edge of the mattress, Claude allowed his eyes to drink in the lines of her sleeping figure, lingering over every detail.

He lifted his left hand, pausing mid-air as if savoring the anticipation, and then let his palm drift gently to her cheek.

Heat radiated from his fingers as they skimmed over her skin, impossibly soft beneath his touch.

A sharp breath caught in his throat, barely audible, as the sensation threatened to overwhelm him.

The delicate feel of her skin sent a tremor racing through his body.

Craving more, he found himself bending lower, moving inch by inch, drawn toward her in the silence.

His cheek grazed hers, a feather-light contact that made his heart pound. His eyes fluttered shut, a wave of contentment washing over him.

Still, it wasn't enough to satisfy the restless ache inside. A wild urge clawed at him from within, louder than reason.

Compelled by longing,,Claude carefully peeled back the blanket's edge. He eased his tall frame onto the mattress beside Hannah, moving with deliberate caution.

In the quiet, his heart thundered in his chest. Turning to face her, he slipped an arm around Hannah's waist, both protective and possessive, and gently drew her closer until her entire body was pressed against his embrace.

Her scent flooded his senses, and he drew in a deep, almost desperate breath, unable to get enough. That was her signature scent, something undeniably Hannah, unlike anyone else.

Beneath his touch, Hannah stirred ever so slighty,shifting in her sleep.

Claude felt her shift in his arms, and rather than letting go, he instinctively pulled her closer.

Minutes crawled by, and he lay awake, afraid that sleep might shatter the fragile reality of this moment.

As morning crept near, Claude finally propped himself up, intent on slipping away.

But the absence of her warmth in his arms gnawed at him, leaving him hollow.

He hesitated and then leaned in close again, unwilling to leave, eyes fixed on her peaceful sleeping face.

A darker, fiercer urge surged through him, completely drowning out the last of his restraint.

Claude bent down, this time not content with just brushing his cheek against hers. He aimed lower, seeking the delicate skin of her neck.

With a determined hunger, he pressed his lips against her neck, leaving a lingering,heated kiss.

A faint, wet sound broke the stillness, matched by the insistent pull of his mouth.

Hannah let out a soft, involuntary gasp at the sudden contact, her brow furrowing slightly as her body instinctively tensed.

But Claude, swept up in a twisted satisfaction, couldn't bring himself to let go. One hand held her shoulder steady, anchoring her as he claimed the moment. He wanted to leave his mark.

For a heartbeat, the world seemed to stand still.

Finally, he pulled back, eyes glinting with satisfaction as he admired the hickey blooming on her slender neck,prominently visible. He reached out with trembling fingertips, gently tracing the edge of the kiss mark with a sense of infatuation.

Unable to resist, Claude snapped a photo of his work. Satisfied to his core, he slipped out quietly,pulling the door shut behind him.
###Chapter 304 She'll Only Be Mine


Morning broke over the Jones Group's headquarters, where the top-floor conference room buzzed with tension.

Vincent hadn't caught a wink of sleep. He sat at the head of the long table, pressing his fingertips to his temples, exhaustion etched across his face.

Board members filled the room, every one of them frowning. The air crackled with barely contained outrage.Among them, Liam Aldridge looked like he might burst a blood vessel-his hair wild, his hand slamming the table as hedemanded, "Vincent, what the hell was wrong with you last night?"

Liam raised his voice and thundered, "Because of your single order, the downtown hotels alone hemorrhaged tens of millions overnight! The company isn't your personal experiment. How do you plan to make up for that loss-and fix the Jones Group's image?"

He hurled a thick stack of loss reports onto the table. Each page was packed with staggering figures.

Another board member, Keenan Castillo, wasn't about to let up. "And what's with this 'emergency safety investigation' excuse? What kind of safety threat warrants shutting down every hotel at once? It's totally reckless-like you're gambling with the very foundation of the company. The shareholders want real answers, and so do we."

Vincent didn't flinch. He sat silent at the head, his expression carved from stone, eyes glinting with icy resolve. With a sharp motion, he brushed aside the pile of documents in front of him. His reply was quiet,but his tone sliced through the uproar like a blade. "Are you done yelling?"

His gaze swept the table, daring any challenge from the enrage board members. "Last night, there was an assault on the very heart of this company. If we'd hesitated even a moment, we wouldn't just be talking about the financial loss-we'd be talking about the fate of the company."

He rapped his knuckles hard on the tabletop. "You're complaining about losses now? Where were you all last night when security should've been airtight? Who was sealing off those vulnerabilities?" His eyes snapped to Derek. "Did you track down those offshore IPs from last night's illegal intrusion?"

Derek shot to his feet. "Yes, Mr. Jones. We've identified the culprits. The linked financial accounts are already being frozen with police cooperation. We expect to reclaim about seventy percent of the losses. Full asset recovery report will be ready in an hour."

Nervously, Derek wiped his brow. He'd watched Vincent storm in after midnight and single-handedly hunt down several of the intruders before passing the case on.

"Did everyone catch that?" Vincent's gaze swept back to the board, sharp enough to cut.

But Liam wasn't backing down. "Even so, you had no right to bypass the board. Major decisions like this require consultation. Acting alone is dictatorship."

Vincent's presence intensified, commanding the room. "By the time your endless emergency procedure is in motion, the enemy would've already stripped us bare. The damage wouldn't stop at numbers on a spreadsheet."

He let his eyes sweep the table, making sure every director felt the weight of his words. "We faced a crisis,and I made a call. If anyone has to answer for it, I will bear the full responsibility."

A thick silence settled over the room.

Still, the faces of the senior board members stayed shadowed with doubt and frustration.

Vincent was just about to move forward with the audit when the doors swung open.

An elderly woman made her way inside at ameasured pace. Sharon had arrived.

Liam's eyes sparked with hope, as if rescue had finally come. He rushed to her side. "Ms. Jones, you got here just in time! Please, you have to see what Vincent-"

Sharon held up a hand, cutting himn off, and made her way directly to the head of the table."Vincent,haven't I always told you to act with caution? Look at the chaos you've stirred up."

Her words were chiding, but when she reached for Vincent's hand, her support was unmistakable. Vincent remained composed. "Come, have a seat, Grandma," he said, guiding her gently to a chair.He'd planned to keep things civil-but now that his grandmother was pulled into the fray, he had no intention of holding back.

Liam jumped at the chance to make his case. "Vincent's gone way over the line. He needs to be held accountable. Running things solo can't continue-some of his power has to be delegated-he needs checks and balances."

A few board members murmured their agreement, nodding along.

Vincent looked to his grandmother for a brief moment before letting his gaze settle coldly on Liam. A faint,sardonic smile curled his lips. "Checks and balances? Maybe you should ask yourself whether you even deserve a seat at this table."

Before anyone could respond, his expression hardened. "Derek, bring them in."

The side door of the conference room opened.

Derek entered, followed by several security guards escorting a group of gloomy,senior executives.

At the sight of Liam, one of them crumpled, breaking down on the spot. "Mr. Aldridge, you have to help me!You told me to snatch that client's encryption key during all the chaos! You said we could sell it to pay off your debts-"

Vincent's gaze remained icy and detached. Even in the middle of last night's disaster, Liam had tried to turn a profit.

Fortunately, Vincent had seen it coming.

"That's a lie! He's framing me!" Liam exclaimed, panic written all over his face.

Sharon didn't wait for explanations-she slammed her cane against the floor with a crack."SOyou were the rot in this company all along! Accusing my grandson while you stabbed us in the back!"

Vincent's response was swift. "Take them away. Hand all evidence to the polce. Track down every associated account and recover every last cent. No exceptions."
Security wasted no time moving in. The previously defiant board members were now pale and shaking as they were led out of the room.

Vincent cast a glacial look at the remaining attenders.′′Arnyone else want to speak up?"

Silence hung thick in the air.

Derek let out a quiet sigh of relief. Thankfully, Vincent had spent the second half of the night orchestrating all of this.

Vincent was about to call the meeting to a close when his phone buzzed with a new notification.

Two photos from Claude.

The first showed Hannah sleeping peacefully. The second-a close-up of a vivid love bite on her neck.

The message read. "She'll only be mine."

Vincent's face darkened. A chill swept the room. Nobody dared to make a sound.
###Chapter 305 Having Her Entirely For Himself Was All He Wanted


nah drifted into a heavy, almost dreamless sleep and did not stir until noon.

n she finally woke, the lingering haze left her wandering through the mansion in a daze.

eyes soon landed on a dark gray door at the end of the hallway, its stark appearance making it stand out s place.

osity got the best of her, and she moved closer, drawn to the door for reasons she couldn't explain.

ia."

ing her name, she turned sharply toward the sound of Claude's voice, which came from behind and ed a hint of warmth.

found Claude waiting several steps away at the corridor's corner, his smile relaxed and casual as if he'd just arrived. "You are up? I was just about to find you. Lunch will be ready soon."

lingering doubts in Hannah's mind vanished instantly, and she gave him an embarrassed smile. "1elled something delicious and got lost looking for the dining room. This door here just looks so different."

ude let out a soft chuckle. "Ah, inside there is just my personal collection. There are all sorts of things de-odd old antiques my grandfather used to collect and some oddball things I picked up at auctions.estly, it's nothing but a pile of useless junk."

ih that, he strolled over and stopped beside her, resting to describe what he'd prepared for lunch.

Hannah listened intently,realizing she was indeed a bit hungry.

Unbeknownst to her, cold sweat beaded on Claude's neck. He had come dangerously close to being caught.

Soon enough, they reached the dining room.

"Go ahead and taste this," Claude said as he served her a bowl of soup with gentle hands.

Hannah glanced at the meal he had arranged and caught the tenderness in his gaze, a wave of warmth washing over her. "Thank you, Claude. This looks wonderful," she replied, settling herself at the table.

Claude gave her a pleased nod. "I'm glad you like it," he answered, taking a seat across from her.

He gestured for her to eat while he barely touched his own food, his gaze fixed on Hannah's face with a nearly greedy tenderness. The dining room felt hushed, the only sound coming from the clatter of cutlery and dishes.

Hannah ate in silence, while Claude watched her silently.

Not until Hannah put her spoon aside and dabbed her mouth with a napkin did she make a move to stand and head for the door.

Before she could say anything, Claude spoke up.′′Areyou leaving already?"

She nodded. "Yes, and thank you again for preparing all this. Everything was delicious," she said as she rose from her chair.

Claude stood up, moving to her side, his voice soft."Anna..."

He lifted his hand, reaching as though to touch her arm, but hesitated, stopping just short and fixing her with 'a sincere, searching look. "I wish we could stay here forever. Just the two of us. Quiet and peaceful...Wouldn't that be perfect?"

Hannah froze for a moment. When she met Claude's eyes, overflowing with a soft, yearning hope,she instinctively interpreted his words to mean that he was tired of the icy grandeur of the Hobbes family estate.What he longed for was a true sense of belonging. He had mentioned how lonely he felt during his hospital stay, and now that loneliness was clear in every word.

Her heart melted a little. She gave him a warm smile and offered comfort. "You can always come to Sterling Heights if you need a break. My parents and I are there. Whenever you feel down, just visit us."

A fleeting, imperceptible tension passed through the depths of Claude's eyes. She still had no idea! What he truly longed for was nothing like the family warmth at Sterling Heights. His desire centered on her-no one else. Having her entirely for himself was all he wanted.

Claude didn't explain, concealing that momentary stiffness behind a gentle, agreeable smile as he nodded."Alright, I get it. Drive safe." He smoothly avoided her invitation and switched topics. "By the way, try to stay off the freeway during rush hour. There was a serious crash there just last week."

Reaching for her purse, Hannah offered a final reminder. "Got it. Make sure you get enough rest. If your stomach starts acting up, take your medicine and don't skip a dose."

"Alright," Claude replied softly, his gaze practically glued to her back as he watched her leave the foyer and disappear outside. He stood there listening until the sound of her car faded away.

The warmth in his smile dropped away in a heartbeat. A cold darkness settled over his expression, cold as the deepest sea.

Without another word, he made his way to the room Hannah had almost entered, pressing his fingers to the keypad.

A soft ding signaled as the gray door slid open.

Inside, there were no shelves of odd auction finds.

Every wall was blanketed in photographs, hundreds-maybe thousands. Every single picture was of Hannah.
###Chapter 306 The Love Bite


Photographs of Hannah filled every wall of the room. One showed her sharing a first kiss with Vincent back in their college days, while another captured her in a white wedding gown on her marriage day. There was even a photo of her stubborn glare as she signed the divorce papers at the courthouse.

Each picture marked a unique Chapter in Hannah's life.

Claude walked slowly, making his way to the middle of the room where a large metal worktable stood.Resting on top of it was nothing but a state-of-the-art photo printer.

Taking his time, he reached into his suit jacket, pulled out his phone, and sent two new pictures to the printer.

Moments later, the screen lit up with both images: one showing Hannah asleep at four in the morning,the other focusing on a fresh love bite.

A soft whirring sound filled the room as the printer went to work.

Two crisp photos slid out onto the tray.

He gathered them in his hands, and a wild, heated intensity shone in his eyes. Bringing the photo close,he bowed his head and pressed his lips, warm and slightly trembling, against the center of the love bite.

Then, he picked up a pair of magnetic pins, and with careful ceremony, attached both images to the very center of the front wall.

Those new photos were now pinned on the old wedding portrait, the one that had been violently marked with a thick red X.

Stepping back, he admired what he had done, a sense of satisfaction settling over him.

Afterward, he turned to a different device in the room and typed in a quick command, clearly familiar with the process. A large screen flickered to life, playing silent footage from the guest room taken the night before.

The video showed him cradling Hannah while she slept-a scene he replayed over and over.

No one could say how long Claude stayed there, enveloped by the shadows in that room.

When he finally stepped out, he walked down the hallway and came across a housekeeper with cleaning supplies in her hands. She was just about to start cleaning the bedroom where Hannah had stayed.

A sudden wave of fury burned in Claude's eyes, the darkness in his stare impossible to miss. He stormed forward, his voice shaking with rage he barely managed to hold back. "Stop! Who told you to come near this room? Get out right now!"

The housekeeper broke down in tears and ran away as fast as she could.

Claude spun around and faced the butler, delivering his next order in a tone as cold as ice. "No one is allowed near that bedroom from now on."

The butler bowed deeply, answering in a steady, respectful voice, "Understood."

..·
Hannah was just about to pull to the curb around Nova Tech when out of nowhere, three black sedans appeared, closing her in with a tight and intimidating formation. Her car was suddenly forced to a stop at the entrance to a secluded back alley.

The screech of the tires echoed through the air.

Shaken,she immediately locked the doors and looked all around, trying to spot any danger.

Almost instantly, eight tall men in black suits climbed out from the three cars, closing in on her car from every direction.

Without showing any panic, Hannah reached for her phone, ready to call the police.

Suddenly, the middle car's door swung open hard. The bodyguards stepped aside, making a narrow passage in their ranks. A figure emerged from the center, taking slow, deliberate steps forward.

Hannah's breath hitched. Could this be the moment? Was the person who had been pulling the strings finally making an appearance?

Her eyes lifted as she steeled herself to see who it would be-only to freeze in surprise. Vincent? What was he doing here, and why arrive with such a dramatic display?

Vincent's face was set in a stormy scowl. But when he glanced at the empty passenger seat and checked the back, finding no one else inside, the fierce tension in his eyes softened ever so slightly. He had been certain that Claude would drive Hannah back. That was why he brought so much security. But it turned out Claude wasn't here. Good. That made things simpler.

"Get out," Vincent commanded. The words were spoken in a low voice, yet the authority in his tone cut straight through the silence.

Hannah pushed the door open, stepped out; and stood tall. She faced him. "What is this supposed to be?"

Vincent ignored her question entirely. His eyes focused with unsettling accuracy on the side of her neck.

Before she could even register what was happening, he took a sharp step forward.

In an instant, his hand shot out, cold and unyielding, grabbing her chin and tilting her head up with rough force.

His other hand immediately brushed her hair aside and pressed firmly against her neck, searching in a way that felt harsh and intrusive.

Everything about his actions was quick-almost violent.

"Ah!" Hannah let out a small cry when his grip suddenly became tighter.

She tried to twist away, but he overpowered her without hesitation, forcing her head at an angle so he could examine her more closely.

He found what he was looking for. Just above her collarbone, a bold red mark stood out-undeniable and intimate. That sight triggered a memory. Vincent instantly remembered Claude's phone call. All the missing pieces suddenly fell together.

For a moment, time seemed to freeze, stretching out into a long silence. His fingers remained locked on her neck, growing colder, and his knuckles turned white from the pressure.

"Give me an explanation," he said coldly.
###Chapter 307 A New Home


Hannah's skin on the side of her neck ached from Vincent's grip, and she instinctively twisted, trying to shake his hand off her neck.

It wasn't until he'd coldly uttered the word, "Give me an explanation," that she understood. He was mad at her for standing him up yesterday. Her racing thoughts snapped into place. Vincent had taken her absence as a personal offense, and now he was reacting with cold, irrational fury. For a man used to being in control,maybe it was the first time someone had dared stand him up. His anger, in that light, made sense.

"I'm sorry," Hannah said, her voice even and steady as she met his eyes. "There was an emergency yesterday, and I... I had to deal with it quickly. I forgot to let you know. That was my fault-I admit to that."

Vincent's eyes held no warmth, only an icy sharpness that cut through her words. This wasn't the explanation he wanted. His voice lost all trace of softness as he hammered out the question. "Were you with Claude last night?"

"How do you know?" Hannah blurted.

Her question was tantamount to an admission-admitting that she had indeed spent the entire night with Claude.Vincent said nothing. The storm in his gaze didn't explode-it collapsed inward, swallowed by a deathly stillness that chilled the place.

The air turned heavy, frozen in silence.

Then, without a word, Vincent stepped forward and seized her wrist. His grip was just as firm as before,laced with finality and silent command. "Come with me." His voice was low, but its quiet edge left no room for refusal.

Pain shot through Hannah's wrist as he dragged her forward. She resisted. "Where are we going?"

"To make up for last night's missed dinner." He didn't even glance back. His voice was flat,almost mechanical, like he was stating an order, not giving a reason.
Hannah frowned at the absurdity. "I've already eaten!"

Vincent stopped. He turned slightly, but the shadows veiled his expression. "So what?" he retorted, his tone detached, as if they were discussing the weather. It wasn't a question. It was a declaration.

Without acknowledging her protests, he kept walking, dragging her straight toward the car parked at the center.

The bodyguard had already opened the door for Vincent, while the driver stood silently nearby.

Vincent shoved her into the spacious back seat and climbed in after her.

The door shut with a dull thud, closing them off from the world outside.

He didn't spare her-or anyone else-a single glance. He nodded to the bodyguard waiting outside the window, instructing him, "Park her car."

"Yes, Mr. Jones!" the bodyguard responded immediately.

The engine purred to life, and the car slipped smoothly into the flow of traffic.

Outside the window, the scenery raced by in a blur. Inside the car, the atmosphere was so heavy that it felt like the air had thickened.

Both Hannah and Vincent turned to gaze out the window, neither willing to break the silence.

But the vehicle didn't head toward any restaurant. Instead, it came to a halt in front of a grand manor.

As soon as the car stopped, uniformed staff-already stationed by the entrance-stepped forward promptly,opening the doors with practiced deference for Vincent and Hannah.

Vincent's grip on Hannah's arm was firm, unrelenting. Hannah found herself half-led, half-dragged out of the car.

She scanned the unfamiliar surroundings, her brows drawing together in confusion. "I thought we were going out to eat.What is this place?"

Vincent's eyes briefly flicked across her face, his tone flat.′′Anew home." Inside the expansive, open-plan dining room, a long table had been elegantly set for two.

Vincent walked to the head of the table and pulled out a chair. "Sit."

Hannah drew a slow breath. Escape wasn't an option right now. For the time being, it was safer to comply.

She took her seat. Vincent settled into the chair across from her.

Dinner began in thick, suffocating silence.

Hannah had no appetite. She picked up her knife and fork, but merely moved the food around her plate,never bringing a bite to her mouth.

Vincent, by contrast, appeared genuinely focused on his meal, eating with composed ease.

Hannah's gaze settled on his face. Her thoughts drifted to the financial headlines from the previous night.Breaking the silence, she spoke. "Didn't the Jones Group make the news last night? There were rumors about internal power struggles."

She picked up a napkin and dabbed the corner of her mouth with careful grace. "In a situation like that, Mr.Jones,how do you have the luxury to sit here and dine so leisurely? I assumed you'd be buried in meetings."

Vincent's hand paused briefly over his plate, the knife mid-slice-barely a second of hesitation. "It was nothing serious.Already handled." His deep voice was calm, unreadable.

Hannah was surprised. With its astounding sums and dubious activities, the crisis that had shaken the Jones Group last night was anything but "nothing serious." But Vincent had handled it quickly in a single morning with his means and resources.

Vincent wiped his mouth slowly with a tissue. "Now, it's my turn."
###Chapter 308 I'm Not Marrying You Again


A puzzled look crossed Hannah's face, unsure what Vincent was getting at.

Once Vincent finished wiping his mouth, Hannah quickly gathered herself and spoke in her usual cool tone."Is that everything? Am I free to go now?"

Vincent gave no reply. What he intended to do was so startling, so wildly out of place, that Hannah could only stare in disbelief.

He lifted his right hand and snapped his fingers, the sharp sound echoing in the room.

A hidden door quietly swung open in one corner.

A server appeared, dressed in crisp black, guiding a cart draped in deep velvet with deliberate, silent movements.

No dishes or glasses decorated the top-just a cascade of yellow roses, each one perfectly open and glowing with color. At the very heart of the blooms sat a single, breathtaking diamond ring.

Hannah went rigid, unable to move. Yellow roses? And a diamond ring? Was this actually a proposal? A line creased her forehead as she struggled to make sense of what was happening.

Without a word, the server slipped away as Vincent pushed back his chair and stood. He moved around the length of the dining table, every step steady and unhurried.

Stopping right beside her, Vincent lifted the ring from its bed of flowers. He lowered himself to one knee,taking his time.

Raising his eyes to meet hers, Vincent held the ring with fingers that trembled ever so slightly, damp with nervousness. He swallowed hard before speaking, his voice rough and low. "Marry me again, Hannah."

To Hannah, the moment was overwhelming.Everything about this dinner, the elaborate arrangement and the surprise, felt so out of his character.
Hannah stayed perfectly still. She remained seated, and after a long pause, she began to extend her right hand.

A sudden jolt of hope gripped Vincent's chest, making his heart beat faster than ever. She actually reached out! Was she really going to say yes?

Barely able to keep his hands steady, Vincent moved closer, ready to slide the ring onto her finger.

But Hannah did not allow him to finish. Instead, her fingers gently pinched the ring and plucked it from his grasp.

The excitement drained from Vincent's face in an instant.

Holding the band between her fingers, she made no move to wear it, nor did she reject it outright. Turning her head, she lifted the ring into the light of the chandelier and studied it carefully.

Her fingers rolled the ring back and forth, her gaze focused and intense-until something unreadable flickered across her face. A faint, ironic smile touched her lips."So... you could not even be bothered to get a new ring,could you?"

Vincent tensed, caught off guard.

She gave him a cold look as she rotated the band. "This looks just like the old one. Same shape, same stone...You really thought I would not notice?"

His throat tightened as he explained, "I had this made a long time ago. If you'd rather have something else,we can choose a different one together. Whatever you want.1′S−′′

Hannah interrupted him with a harsh, bitter laugh. She dangled the ring in front of his eyes,pointing straight at the inscription on the side. She asked, her voice sharp and cold, "Seriously? You want to give me a ring you picked out for someone else-and you think I am supposed to be happy about that? This is what you want to use for our remarriage?"

Vincent straightened, a furrow of frustration creasing his forehead. "That ring was never for anyone else.I always meant for you to have it." She tilted her head, skepticism written all over her face. "You honestly think I am going to fall for that?" Her gaze turned sharp, sarcasm flashing in her eyes. "That is the very same ring Brinley had once showed off on her social media. Same stone, same setting. You want me to believe it is all just a fluke?"

Vincent kept his voice steady, though his jaw was tight. "This ring has nothing to do with Brinley. I picked it out ages ago. The design was made for you."

Before she could say another word, he lunged forward and grabbed the ring from her hand.

Hannah could hardly react before his fingers wrapped around her left hand and, without hesitation, he slid the ring onto her wedding finger.

Cold metal pressed against her skin, and as she instinctively tried to pull away, his hold only grew firmer."It fits, doesn't it?" His voice was low, almost a whisper. "I had it made for you."

The band sat there, a perfect fit. Not too loose, not too tight. As if it had always belonged on her hand.

For a moment, Hannah froze. Uncertainty flickered through her expression. Had she really misunderstood him? So what if she had? Even if she had misjudged the story behind the ring, that did not mean she owed him a thing. Was she supposed to accept his proposal just because she made a mistake?

Her eyes fell to the band, gleaming on her finger-and, with careful intent, she slid it off. A quick flick of her wrist sent the ring tumbling across the floor. It clattered and spun before finally settling.

"No," she said, her voice calm and certain.

To erase any doubt, she added, every word clear as glass, "I'm not marrying you again."
###Chapter 309 I'm Going To Make You Feel


The clang of the ring hitting the floor was like a sharp knife, cutting through the fragile facade of Vincent's composure. From the moment he forced Hannah to pull over, he had been suppressing the turbulent emotions within him.

All at once, his restraint snapped. Any trace of calm vanished from his face, replaced by a raw, unfiltered anger.

"Why?" His voice came out rough and broken. He lunged forward, erasing the distance between them in an instant.

Hannah instinctively stepped back, her back colliding heavily with the cold edge of the chair behind her.Still, her eyes held steady, cold and unafraid, as she stared straight at him. "I don't feel anything for you."

To Vincent, this was the most unacceptable answer. Memories flashed in his mind-the sultry voices drifting through the line and that undeniable love bite on Hannah's neck.

"Don't feel anything?" he repeated. The last thread of reason in his mind snapped at that moment. "You feel nothing for me?" His laugh was bitter and filled with disbelief. "But you feel something for Claude?"

Hannah frowned, sensing a misunderstanding on Vincent's part.

Before she could say anything, he had already seized her.

Vincent movedso fast that she barely saw it coming, and his grip was ironclad. He locked one arm around her waist, yanking her close with a force that made escape impossible. There was nothing tender about the way he held her.

"Vincent, have you lost your mind? What are you trying to do?" Hannah struggled fiercely, kicking and shoving as she struggled to break free.

Every bit of her resistance only made Vincent's anger burn hotter. "What do you think I'm doing?" His breath burned against her ear, hot and ragged. "I'm going to make you feel something!" He could not accept the idea that she was numb to him. Without warning, the hand at her waist slid roughly beneath the slit of her dress.

"Ah!" Hannah gasped sharply, her body flinching at the sudden invasion.

Vincent ignored her tension, his touch rough and harsh, lacking any gentleness or warmth-driven only by raw, possessive anger.

"You claimn you don't feel anything? Then explain this,"he said, his grip pressing harder, as if trying to prove a point through force.

Refusing to cry out, Hannah bit hard on her lower lip, swallowing the pain. This man was compleely out of control.

Moments dragged by, each second feeling endless.

No matter how rough Vincent became, Hannah's body remained cold and unresponsive.

That truth crashed over himn like a shock of cold water, quenching the heat of his anger in an instant. His assault faltered, the frenzy draining from his movements.

"Are you finished?" Hannah asked, her voice flat, not even glancing his way as she stepped aside.

A heavy wave of shame crashed into Vincent, wiping out every trace of rage. He stumbled back, as if the ground had disappeared beneath him. He realized he had lost control again. "I... apologize." Each word was dragged from him, strained and difficult to say.

"Apology?" A low, mocking laugh slipped from Hannah's lips. She closed the distance between them until only half a foot separated them. "Your apology doesn't mean a thing to me."

Before he could even react, she grabbed hold of his right wrist and, with a sudden surge of strength, shoved him backward.

Vincent staggered, colliding hard with the sideboard behind him. With a thud, the impact sent pain shooting up his back, but Hannah pressed on.

Her hand moved without hesitation, slipping beneath his trousers with determined force. There was nothing
gentle or playful in her touch. Only hard, relentless pressure-her fingers squeezed, kneaded,and claimed the most vulnerable part of him.

Every move she made was calculated, her roughness echoing what he had done to her just moments ago.

Vincent could have broken away if he truly wanted, but he stayed frozen, his eyes never leaving her face.

Hannah's grip tightened, her voice as cold and steady as steel. "So, tell me-how does it feel to be on the receiving end? Do you enjoy it?"

Her hand shifted slightly, pulling a strangled groan from his throat.

"Sorry." Her lips curled into a frosty, unyielding smile as she spoke the word with absolute clarity."1wanted you to feel it. Every second."

With that, Hannah yanked her hand away and gave him one more shove for good measure.

She was not the type to swallow an insult or injury. There would be no forgiveness, no letting go,not from her. She was no pushover.
###Chapter 310 Daphne Wanted A Talk


Hannah withdrew her hand, and Vincent's body shivered under the aftereffect of her grip, the sensation surging through him like an electric current. Gradually, the sharp sting began to fade, the overwhelming ache retreating bit by bit.

Yet, something unusual stirred inside him. Surprisingly, Hannah's act hadn't offended him in the least. If he could ignore the pain, he would have welcomed her nearness without hesitation. In fact, a strange sense of longing clung to her presence-almost like an addiction he couldn't shake.

Hannah calmly dusted off her clothes, collected her handbag, and headed toward the door.

Vincent's voice broke the silence. "Wait."

She stopped in place but didn't turn around. "What? Wasn't the pain just now enough for you?"

Struggling, Vincent reached for the document resting on the dining cart beside him-the "Remarriage Agreement." Remarriage was the central purpose of today's encounter. He couldn't let her leave without addressing the main issue.

With the seriousness of closing a major business deal, he extended the document toward her. "Take alook and give me your answer. You can name your conditions."

His tone was sharp and commanding, the same voice he used when sealing corporate contracts.

Hannah whipped around. She didn't take the document, but her eyes landed squarely on the bold title:"Remarriage Agreement." Then, her gaze lifted to meet Vincent's. "Vincent, even now, this is what you're focused on?"

Vincent avoided her eyes and extended the document once again, his motions quickening as he tried to appeal to reason. "The,clauses inside benefit you."

He added, almost absurdly, "You'll have your share of assets, your own accounts, and complete freedom to live where you like. My lawyer already reviewed everything. If you walk away now, you're missing-" "Don't want to review the agreement. No remarriage. Goodbye." Hannah cut him off mid-sentence, her voice firm, her decision absolute.

Without another word, she pivoted, pressed down the door handle and walked out without looking back.

The hall, now hollow and still, was left with only Vincent standing in its silence.

***

Hannah returned to Nova Tech. As soon as she settled into her office, her phone rang. It was Gavin.

Figuring the officers might have found the person responsible for Alice's allergic reaction, she answered the call, and Gavin's voice came through, grave and measured. "We had to release Daphne earlier due to a lack of solid evidence. But just today, she turned herself in-on one condition. She insists on speaking with you alone. She's extremely agitated and claims she has something urgent to tell you face-to-face."

Hannah's expression chilled. Daphne turned herself in? And now she suddenly wanted a meeting?

"Officer Mercer, I don't see the point of having a private conversation with someone so biased against me."Her voice was calm, detached.

Gavin's tone grew heavier. "Ms. Scott, she claims to possess critical evidence. For the sake of the investigation, we're hoping you'll agree. We'll arrange a private meeting room."

"New evidence?" Hannah's fingers drifted over the icy surface of her desk, unconsciously tracing its edge.

She paused for a couple of seconds and then spoke with cold resolve. "No need for a private room. Let her come to my office.Have two officers stationed outside to record and film the entire exchange."

Gavin's surprise crackled through the line. "That goes against protocol."

"Protocol?" Hannah's lips curved into a frosty smile. "Officer Mercer, this meeting was your suggestion. If it's against protocol, then please refuse her request."

She tossed the decision squarely back to him.

A brief silence followed before Gavin replied,"Ten minutes. We'll handle the setup."
Ten minutes later, outside Nova Tech's executive office, the tension hung heavy in the air.

The door opened. Two officers escorted Daphne inside. They brought her to the guest seating area in the center of the office.

Hannah remained seated behind her expansive desk, scrutinizing Daphne. She broke the silence."I hear you've got something you can only say to me in person?"

Daphne didn't go straight to the point. Instead, her voice took a cryptic tone. "Hannah, did you know? Jail gets unbearably cold-especially at night."

Hannah leaned back slightly, her fingers loosely interlaced. "Oh? Then you should enjoy your freedom while it lasts."

Daphne's abrupt confession was suspicious, and Hannah intended to rattle her.

A wild gleam flickered in Daphne's eyes. She suddenly straightened, shedding the fragile facade she had worn like armor. A crooked smile broke across her face, and she delivered her next words with icy precision."Hannah, are you afraid of prison?"

The room fell still, the air thick with unease.

Hannah's brows drew together in the faintest frown."What?"

Daphne saw the slight change and smiled wider, her expression unraveling with madness. She raised her voice sharply, shouting toward the door, "Officer! I want to report something! I was wrong. I shouldn't have taken the fall for someone else. It was Hannah! She's the mastermind behind everything. Alice's allergy-Hannah planned it from the start."
###Chapter 311 Under Interrogation


The accusation thundered through the office, leaving everyone in shock.

Hannah sprang up from her chair. She didn't bang on the table. She kept her tone level, refusing to raise her voice., Her gaze, sharp and unflinching, locked onto Daphne with the force of a blade. When she spoke, her words sliced through the silence. "What nonsense are you spouting?"

Daphne smiled coldly and mouthed the words, silent but unmistakable, "You're going to prison."

Bang! The office door flew open with a crash. Two officers entered, their faces set in hard, grim lines.

"Officers, this woman... She threatened my life!" Daphne cried out, scrambling behind one of the officers for protection and pointing a shaking finger at Hannah. "I was terrified for my safety!"

One officer stepped closer, authority clear in every movement."Ms. Scott, Daphne has made a formmal accusation. The entire exchange has been recorded and is legally admissible. We need you to come with us for questioning."

Hannah never broke eye contact with Daphne, her voice smooth as glass. "Would you like a reminder about the penalty for criminal defamation?" She lowered her voice just enough for Daphne to hear, each word deliberate. "Your dear Brinley? I was the one who had her locked up. Do you really want to share her fate?"

Daphne's smug smile faltered, and fear flickered in her eyes. "You-you think you can intimidate me like this?" she shouted, her voice trembling and raw. "You just wanted the spotlight and poisoned Alice! Officers,take her away!"
Hannah refused to spare Daphne another glance. She turned instead to the officers, dusting off her sleeves as if nothing was out of place."Of course. A citizen has to cooperate with the police. Officers, shall we?"

With'a quiet dignity, Hannah walked out of her office flanked by an officer on each side-escorted, never dragged.

Out in the hall, executives and staff had already gathered, their conversations stilled by the sight. Some stared at Hannah in open shock, while others directed looks of doubt and disdain toward Daphne.

Hannah's composure never wavered. Step by step, she moved forward with her head held high, showing not
a shred of shame even as her colleagues watched her being led away.

The elevator dropped down toward the ground floor.

From the basement garage, the police car rolled out beneath the Nova Tech tower. But the instant it reached the street, the world exploded into mayhem.

A wall of people crowded the sidewalk outside Nova Tech, all shouting and waving signs in the air.

Among the protesters, some wore Alice's fan shirts, others just seemed eager to join the outrage. They chanted slogans and brandished photos, holding up signs that read things like "Justice for Alice" and "Lock up Hannah Scott!"

As soon as the police car came into view, the crowd erupted.

"Hannah Scott, you think your money will save you?"

"Say sorry to Alice!"

"Officers, send her to prison-give her what she deserves!"

Eggs and bottles flew, pelting the police car with sharp, loud smacks against the glass.

In the chaos, the police car crept forward inch by inch, barely able to force a way through the furious mob.

From inside, Hannah stared straight ahead, her eyes steady as she watched angry faces pressed up against the window. Insults hurled through the glass, vicious and loud. For the first time, her calm facade had cracked-not from fear, but from the gravity of the situation. This scene was too carefully timed, too convenient to be an accident.

Clearly, someone had planned this-every moment, every crowd, every accusation. The timing of Daphne's confession was already suspicious, and now, right after her accusation, a mob had appeared with perfect precision. Everything seemed far too coordinated. At last, the police car managed to break through the chaos and leave the scene behind.

Once at the station, Hannah was led straight to the interrogation room.

Gavin took the lead, handling the questioning himself.

Throughout it all, Hannah kept her composure, responding to every question and methodically breaking down Daphne's accusations.

Hannah said calmly, "The hospital confirmed that Alice suffered from an allergic reaction to Red Thorn,a toxic substance. I do not have access to that. You're welcome to search me, my apartment, or my office if you like."

Hannah paused and then continued with a cold, pointed tone, "Even if I wanted to hurt Alice, you've seen for yourself how Daphne treats me. She despises me. Are you really convinced she would simply follow my orders? What I want to know is why she fought so hard to deny it before, only to suddenly confess now. Isn't that a bit strange?"

Gavin listened without giving anything away, his face unreadable. Even so, uncertainty hung in the air. The interrogation reached an uneasy pause.

For the time being, Hannah was sent to a temporary holding room to rest.

Her attorney, Samuel Pierce, had already arrived and was working through the paperwork. They were given a moment to speak in private.

Standing by the window, Hannah's gaze was cold and determined.′′Mr. Pierce, is there any chance I can post bail today?"

He looked surprised. "It might take some real effort. Are you certain this is the route you want to take?"

She turned away from the glass to face him. "Whoever orchestrated this had a clear plan--get me arrested,have Daphne throw out the accusation, and use the public outrage to ruin both my name and Nova Tech's reputation. Someone is controlling everything from behind the scenes."

Her tone dropped, growing firm and quiet. "That's why I want to leave through the front door, head held up.I want to force whoever's behind this to reveal themselves."

Recent successes had given Hannah momentum, as VelaCore's lingerie show had been a hit, store sales had soared, and the Celestial Voyage project had been making real progress. She wondered if her enemy was a business rival trying to knock Nova Tech off its path. That answer still escaped her. But one way or another, she planned to uncover the truth.
###Chapter 312 The Bet Starts Now


Less than an hour after Hannah was taken into custody, Vincent showed up at the police station. He had a quick discussion with Gavin to understand exactly what was happening. Hannah, however, refused to see him.

Soon after, Claude made his appearance. But he was ushered out of the room where Hannah was detained merely seconds after he barged in.

Vincent felt slightly better. It seemed Hannah had no interest in meeting with Claude either.

For a while, the two men simply stared at each other in silence, neither one willing to budge.

Claude eventually broke the stillness. "Mr. Jones, how impressive-news certainly finds its way to you fast,doesn't it?" A pointed sharpness edged into his words. "All this worry for another man's girlfriend...Funny how your concern always ends up in the wrong place."
Vincent shot Claude a cold, piercing look, and the tension in the air thickened in an instant."Concern?" he replied quietly, his voice carrying a heavy, commanding weight. "I wouldn't call myself a concerned man."

One step forward was allit took for Vincent to make his presence overpowering. "I'm simply looking out for my own woman."

Claude's smirk faded. The polite mask slipped, exposing open hostility in his stare. "Your woman? In case you forgot, she hasn't been yours for a long time."

A steeliness crept into Vincent's voice. "That doesn't matter. She will soon become mine again."

A scoff slipped from Claude, as if Vincent had said something completely absurd. His smile twisted into something mocking. "Delusional. Want to bet on it?"

Vincent's eyebrow barely moved, his look dripping with contempt. "Not interested."

Turning away,Vincent made to leave, but Claude quickly moved to block his exit. Vincent gazed at Claude, his tone almost relaxed but heavy with warning. "Fontaine Galleria hasn't been doing well lately. And yet here you are, wanting to bet with me? Maybe I haven't turned up the heat enough."

For a split second, cold anger flashed in Claude's eyes. The truth was out-Jones Group was indeed squeezing Fontaine Galleria.

Rather than give in, Claude's smile widened, laced with something darker. "I'm impressed by your tactics,Mr. Jones. But it's just a bet-what's holding you back?"

Vincent said nothing, not taking his eyes off Claude.

Leaning in just enough to be provocative, Claude set his terms. "Let's bet on this-whoever gets Hannah out safe and sound first wins. The loser steps out of her life for good. No second chances. Think you can handle that?"

The air went still.

A faint shift flickered in Vincent's eyes. He looked away.′′Waste of time." With that, he turned his back and walked off without saying another word.

Claude stood there, his satisfaction growing as Vincent left. A slow, triumphant smile crept across his face.He raised his voice just enough for Vincent to hear. "You didn't say no, Mr. Jones. I'll count that as your yes.The bet starts now."



Several hours later, Hannah got to meet with Miles.

A shadow of embarrassment clouded MMiles's face. "I'm sorry. I should have kept Daphne in check. Now you've gotten pulled into all this."

Hannah brushed the apology aside, focusing on what mattered. She fixed him with a serious look.′′MWhitaker, has your sister seen anyone unusual recently?"

Miles searched his memory before finally shaking his head. "I really don't know. Daphne's barely talked to any of us lately. She shuts herself away most of the time." Hannah fell silent, thoughtful. That lead was going nowhere.

Meanwhile, Daphne had just finished her questioning and was passing by the designated holding room that Hannah was in.

Daphne paused at the door, eyes darting between her brother and Hannah. "Isn't this quite something? My brother, bending over backwards for an outsider while ignoring his sister. Sometimes I wonder if you'd prefer Hannah as your little sister."

Her words dripped with bitterness and sarcasm. Miles frowned. "You're being ridiculous. Do you even realize what you've done? You still think you're in the right?"

Daphne tossed back her head with a wild, sharp laugh. "Ridiculous? I reported a criminal. I stood up for what's right! You want to talk about guilt? Ask her! She's the one who drugged Alice just to make headlines.She belongs behind bars with the world hating her!"

All the while, Hannah watched in silence, her eyes never leaving Daphne.

When Daphne's tirade finally ended, Hannah leaned in ever so slightly, her voice cold and clear. "Daphne,your stupidity astonishes me."

Daphne stiffened, her glare sharp. "What did you just say? You're the stupid one here!"

Hannah's lips curled, not with humor, but with a chill that cut to the bone. "You had everything,money,status, a future most people only dream about. And now you're here, taking the blame for a crime you've never committed, letting yourself be the perfect scapegoat. So tell me, if that's not stupid, what is?"
###Chapter 313 She Was Released


Daphne's smug expression crumbled in an instant. Panic flickered in the depths of her eyes before she buried it beneath an even more explosive outburst. "What absolute rubbish are you spewing? Scapegoat?You orchestrated this entire mess! Every single detail was your doing-don't you dare try to slither your way out of this!"

Miles's brow furrowed as he spoke with stern authority."Daphne,stop talking nonsense."

Daphne whipped her head away, her face radiating pure defiance.

Hannah's gaze sharpened like a blade as she shook her head slowly, her voice dripping with bitter sarcasm."I orchestrated it? Well, by your account, I supposedly gave you orders. But what difference does that make? The evidence you've presented still exists. I cannot clear my name-everyone has already condemned me. But tell me something, Daphne."

She paused with calculated precision, watching as Daphne's pupils contracted with sudden terror, and then delivered each word like a death sentence. "As the person who supposedly carried out my alleged instructions, do you honestly believe you can escape? If I'm heading to prison, do you think the law will simply allow you-my supposed accomplice-to walk free? To stroll around outside while I rot behind bars?How utterly naive. We're both drowning in this catastrophe together."

Her icy declaration sent Daphne's heart into a violent stutter. Her earlier arrogance evaporated completely,replaced by eyes brimming with raw fear and mounting panic. Erica had promised her something entirely different. Erica had sworn that pointing the finger at Hannah would cleanse her hands completely-perhaps she'd only need to assist with the investigation for a few days at most.

Shaking her head, Daphne resolved to remain steady. The crucial evidence had already found its way to the authorities, and Hannah couldn't possibly escape its grip.

At that moment, the officer began Hannah's second round of interrogation.

Daphne regained her composure and shot Hannah a look of pure triumph. Hannah remained perfectly calm.

Miles stepped out of the waiting room and witnessed Daphne's victorious expression.

"I'm profoundly disappointed in you." Miles furrowed his brow, locking his gaze with Daphne's, his eyes swimming with disappointment. "I believed with absolute certainty that you would never want to harm Alice.But what did you do? Not only did you refuse to clarify the truth, but you insisted that Hannah was the mastermind, pinning things she hadn't done onto her. This is slander! It's a criminal act! Daphne, how could you do such a thing?"

His voice cracked with heartbroken sorrow.

Daphne sneered, her mind flashing back to the photograph Erica had thrust before her eyes that day-her brother and Hannah engaged in what appeared to be an intimate conversation at a cozy café.

That photograph had burned itself into Daphne's memory, especially when she found herself caught and under investigation, desperately craving family support, yet her brother had been out sipping coffee with Hannah. She simply couldn't stomach it.

So when Erica had asked Daphne to claim that Alice's allergic reaction was her fault and then accuse Hannah of manipulating her into it, she had agreed without hesitation.

"Don't lecture me. When you abandoned me to the lawyers, did you remember I was your sister then? You turned around and went for coffee with Hannah immediately afterward. Your sister was the one who got arrested, but all you seemed to care about was precious Hannah." Daphne's agitation escalated with each word. "You don't deserve to call yourself my brother!"

With that final declaration, Daphne abruptly spun around and broke free from the female officer who was attempting to calm her, stumbling toward the restroom in unsteady steps.

Miles stood frozen in complete disbelief.

Meanwhile,Hannah sat alongside her lawyer, facing Gavin for the second round of interrogation.

Gavin cut straight to the heart of the matter."Daphne's testimony contains several inconsistencies, but she has provided concrete physical evidence." He gestured toward his assistant with a deliberate nod, and the equipment whirred to life as a surveillance video flickered onto the wall.

The footage emerged grainy and shadowed, revealing a figure that bore a striking resemblance to Hannah.The person wore identical clothing and stood with their back turned to the camera, passing something directly into Daphne's waiting hands. While the face remained completely hidden from view, the silhouette and attire wove together a compelling visual story-this seemed to be Hannah.

Even Hannah, renowned for her unshakeable composure, couldn't prevent the fleeting ripple of shock that danced across her eyes as she witnessed the footage.

Her lawyer, Samuel, sprang to his feet with sudden intensity, his posture radiating fierce conviction. "Officer Mercer! This video remains completely unclear and fails to definitively identify anyone's facial features! To declare guilt based exclusively on similar clothing and body structure is utterly preposterous. Without any concrete evidence, I demand Ms. Hannah Scott's immediate release! Should the police continue this baseless detention, we will proceed with an administrative lawsuit."

Gavin held his ground with equal determination. "The preliminary evidence is beginning to crystallize.Releasing her at this juncture would lack proper legal foundation."

Hannah tilted forward slightly in her seat. "Officer Mercer, perhaps we might discover a path toward cooperation."

Thirty minutes passed before Hannah had somehow managed to sway Gavin's position, and she was released.

Daphne caught a glimpse of Hannah's departure through the transparent glass partition, her expression shifting violently as she burst into frantic screams, "Someone come here right now! Hannah is trying to escape!"
###Chapter 314 Important Leads


Hannah stopped at the doorway, turning around with deliberate calm. "Officer Mercer said I'm free to go."

A sharp note rang out in Daphne's voice. "Why? You're a criminal-how can they let you leave?"

"Naturally, it was because I'm innocent." Hannah's words were even and steady, ringing out in the quiet hallway.

Panic swept over Daphne's face in an instant. The truth hit her-Hannah was actually leaving. What was she supposed to do now?

"Then let me out, too!" Daphne cried out, her voice cracking. "I want to leave!"

A faint, cool smile tugged at Hannah's lps as she looked over Daphne's tangled, desperate state. "You? No,you're staying." She shook her head slightly, her tone detached and cold. "You're a key witness. You're not going anywhere."

Anxiety etched itself across Daphne's face; she needed to reach Erica fast.

Hannah, meanwhile, had agreed to surveillance by plainclothes officers and worked out a deal with Gavin,which secured her bail. That was how she'd walked out. Now she planned to make her release as public as possible, drawing attention to her innocence. Whoever was behind all this would soon be feeling the pressure.




Elsewhere,Erica slipped into a smoky blue dress, one of Hannah'sfavorites, after hearing about Hannah's trip to the police station. She waited anxiously for word that Hannah would be found guilty.

With a distant look in her eyes, Erica gazed at Logan and murmured, "Vincent, is this really your taste?"

Logan gave a slow nod, mimicking Vincent's every move.

Erica leaned in, her red lips almost grazing Logan's mouth when- Buzz... Her encrypted phone, carelessly left on the armrest, began to vibrate twice in quick succession. The screen lit up, flashing a codename.

Instantly, Erica stopped, her expression cooling as all flirtation faded away. Irritated, she snatched up the phone and swiped to read the message.

One glance at her subordinate's report sent a chill through her, wiping out any hint of romance. "Boss,Daphne just said Hannah's out! She's asking what to do next. She even threatened-she said if you don't step in, she'Il reveal everything!"

Caution was Erica's specialty; she had always made sure Daphne only had her subordinate's number.Daphne believed she was texting Erica, but it was only a middleman.

Bang! A sudden, piercing crash split the air. Erica had slammed her wine glass down on the coffee table,shattering it to pieces.

"Useless idiot!" Erica spat, shooting to her feet, her face twisted by sudden rage.

"Hannah... Hannah!" Grinding out the name, Erica's fury boiled over. She had planned every move, had all the evidence lined up, yet Hannah still slipped away.How was that possible?

After only a moment's pause, Erica collected herself and called her subordinate's encrypted line, her instructions crisp and urgent. "Listen to me. Do whatever it takes to calm Daphne down." Daphne's reckless mouth could ruin everything.

Erica continued with a sharp urgency, "Go find the person who's collaborated with Daphne on that surveillance footage. Make sure the police discover him naturally, but stay careful. Offer him twice the original payment. Tell him if he dares to leak a word, he knows the consequences. As for the phone Daphne has reached out to, destroy it immediately. Take it apart, break the chip, and soak it in acid. Make sure nothing's left. The police will probably start tracking Daphne soon."

Hiding in the shadows, she could not risk being found out.

"Understood," her subordinate replied without hesitation.

Meanwhile, Hannah had wrapped up a tense, short meeting. The falling lines on the Nova Tech and Polaris Tech stock charts flashed on the monitor, each dip drawing anxious glances.

Vincent's message arrived suddenly."Want to talk?"

A small frown appeared on Hannah's face. Memories of their last conversation were still too sharp, so she typed back plainly. "Everything that needed to be said has already been said. There's nothing more to discuss between us."

She was about to block his number again when his next reply landed."This isn't about us. I have important information on who's setting you up."

She hesitated for a second and then wrote."My office."

Not even ten minutes after Hannah put her phone aside, Vincent's tall figure filled the doorway to her office.

His eyes, cold and searching, darted to the two unfamiliar men behind her, men who pretended to read magazines in the corner, but whose alert posture gave them away.

"Must be nice, Ms. Scott, having all this company in your office," Vincent remarked as he walked closer,his tone even but carrying an edge.

Hannah met his level stare, explaining tersely, "The police assigned them. They're here to keep lines of communication open." She wasted no time. "Let's get to the point. What leads did you want to share, Mr.Jones?"
###Chapter 315 Are You Planning To Come Along


Vincent wasted no time with pleasantries. "Do you remember the fire at your VelaCore shop?"

Hannah's face darkened at the mention. "The official investigation said old wiring was to blame."

A cold smirk appeared on Vincent's lips. "I used a few back channels and some high-end tracking tech.Turns out, in the weeks before and after the fire, two extremely careful people were seen near both your shop and your company headquarters. It looked like they were keeping tabs on you. And right on cue, the same two showed up again during the Alice incident."

A chill crept up Hannah's spine. Had she really been watched this entire time?

Vincent's voice dropped even lower. "All those two's signals can be traced to one spot-an old chemical plant out west, at the edge of Dorbarrow. It's called Doreline Chemical Factory."

Without missing a beat, Hannah pulled up details on her computer. "Doreline Chemical is registered under a local man named Frank Donnelly. The business is nothing special, just makes cheap detergents and fragrance bases."

Vincent tapped his fingers on her desk. "That's just what they want people to see. But the real story is this-deliveries only go out at night, and their reported waste is suspiciously low. Whatever they're moving,l doubt it's just cleaning supplies."

A spark of understanding lit up Hannah's eyes. Something about this place wasn't right. She stopped scrolling and looked him squarely in the eyes. "Do you have a precise address?"

He recited a set of coordinates, pausing only to frown."My team is already there, keeping the site under watch. Every entrance, every exit, every vehicle, everyperson-they're all being tracked. More intel is coming soon. But listen, you need to stay out of this. It's not safe."
Hannah's face held steady. "I just got out of police custody. Right now, the press is painting me as someone above the law. My company's shares dropped seven percent as soon as the market opened. The police took
a risk letting me out, and the longer I'm out here, the worse things look for me, for the company,and for the investigation."

Her voice remained cool and even, but determination shone through every word. "Waiting for your team to dig up answers isn't an option. Every minute that goes by makes things harder for all of us. There's finally a real lead. I have to follow it myself."

She got to her feet, meeting his gaze without blinking."My arrival is the one move they'll never see coming.They won't expect me to risk everything just to hunt them down."

Vincent held her stare and saw there was no changing her mind. He let the silence hang between them before finally asking, "Can those officers tailing you be trusted?"

"They'll do what's required. As far as their orders go, that's all I need," she answered simply.

Vincent left it at that. Without another word, he turned and walked out.

Hannah moved quickly, assigning urgent work to her team, checking her wristband's battery, and grabbing both a micro camera and pepper spray. Soon, she headed downstairs, flanked by the two plainclothes officers.

A discreet black sedan pulled out onto the street.

The farther they drove towvard Dorbarrow's edge, the narrower and emptier the roads became.

In the rearview mirror, a plain gray van kept its distance but never disappeared.

A jolt of tension ran through Hannah. She glanced at one of the officers in the back. Both officers responded instantly, hands moving to their comm devices and weapons.

As they passed the split to an abandoned village, the gray van suddenly sped up, swung out, and blocked their path.

Every muscle in Hannah's body tightened. One officer reached for his gun while she slammed her foot on the brake.

The van's door swung open, and Vincent stepped out onto the road. A mix of relief and annoyance escaped Hannah as she let out a long breath. She pushed open her own door."Why were you following me?"

Vincent strode toward her, first scanning the officers as they exited the car, then fixing his gaze on Hannah,his brow knitted in concern. "You planned to walk into that place dressed like a walking target?"

She looked down at her clothes. In her rush, she hadn't considered that at all.

Vincent handed her a black duffel. "Put these on."

Inside the bag, she discovered a pair of sturdy cargo pants, a faded T-shirt, a utility jacket marked with old grease stains, and a worn baseball cap.

He opened the back door of the gray van. "Change in here."

Tinted windows and a roomy interior offered enough privacy.

Without wasting time, Hannah climbed inside and swapped out her clothes.

Vincent pulled out a set of clothes for himself, preparing to change as well, but Hannah cut him off."Why are you getting dressed for this? Are you planning to come along?"

He gave her a steady nod, holding up his own set of dark work clothes.

She blurted the question before she could stop herself, "Why?"

His eyes met hers without wavering."To help you." Then, he stepped into the van to change, no hesitation at all.

When he emerged, already changed, and Hannah muttered to herself, "That was fast."

Vincent's reply was simple. "Efficiency is a habit."

After a brief discussion, Hannah slid into the driver's seat of Vincent's van.

The plainclothes officers trailed them in the black sedan, keeping a careful distance at all times.

When they reached a lonely stretch of road close to Doreline Chemical Factory, Hannah slowed down and
parked. She walked over to the officers to exchange contact numbers.

As she went to add one as her emergency contact, something caught her eye-her wristband emergency setting was still tied to Vincent. The contact had carried over from her old phone, and she had never updated it after switching devices.

A realization hit her. She turned to Vincent, searching his face. "Last time, was it you who saved me?"
###Chapter 316 He Saved Her Last Time


Vincent turned to look at Hannah, uncertainty flickering in his eyes-he didn't seem sure which incident she was pointing to. They had faced so much together that it was hard to keep track. He kept his voice calm and even. "Which time do you mean?"

Hannah held his gaze. "Your grandmother's birthday. The day I was kidnapped."

She remembered how she had been dragged off by·a group of men. In a panic, she'd hit the emergency button on her wristband. That alert had gone straight to Vincent. What she hadn't known, up until now, was whether he had indeed come for her.

A shadow passed through Vincent's eyes as the memory surfaced. He gave a quiet nod. "I did." She had disappeared from the hotel room he'd arranged for her soon after, but at least she hadn't been harmed.

The truth brought Hannah to a standstill. So when she managed to get away, it was Vincent who had found her-the one who had brought her to the hotel where she eventually woke up. All this time, she'd figured her captors had just moved her somewhere else. Now she realized that, beneath all the chaos and confusion, he had been the one to keep her safe.

A rush of mixed feelings stirred inside her-complicated, hard to name, and not something she was ready to unpack. She stayed quiet for a long moment.

Vincent noticed her change immediately, his words laced with curiosity.′′What's going on? Why bring it up now?"

Her thoughts snapped back. She forced down whatever she was feeling and answered, "It's nothing."

At that moment, Jason McCrae, one of the plainclothes officers, spoke up, his tone serious, pulling the focus back to the mission. "Ms. Scott, Mr. Jones, we still have zero intel on what's happening inside that plant. It's dangerous to go in without more information."

Graham Kent, the other officer, chimed in right away, "We've already flagged your intel to the task force.A tactical team is gearing up now. The safest move is to hold our position and let you provide support from the edge of the scene. That's the best way to keep everyone safe."

Hannah inhaled deeply, pushing back against their caution. "We've come this far for a reason. Someone needs to step in and see what's really going on. We won't be careless-we know what we're doing."

There was finality in her voice. Turning to Vincent, she added, "We're not taking any wild chances. If anything feels wrong, we're out of there immediately."

Vincent kept his eyes locked on the dim outline of the factory, silent, his whole body tense with focus.

The officers exchanged a look, recognizing it was pointless to argue further. They simply repeated their instructions, voices firm with concern.

Both Hannah and Vincent handed their phones to Jason for safekeeping.

From his bag, V/incent pulled out a spare phone and handed it to Hannah.

Just as they were ready to move toward the building, Hannah's phone lit up unexpectedly.

Jason remarked, "You've got a call, Ms. Scott. Claude's name is on the screen."

Instantly, Vincent's face darkened.

A faint crease appeared between Hannah's brows. After a quick moment of indecision, she answered,keeping her voice steady. "Claude?"

His reply came across warm, gentle, and familiar. "Hannah, where are you? I just dropped by Nova Tech but the front desk said you stepped out."

She glanced toward the factory as she replied, "I'm handling some things offsite."

Claude's tone stayed easy but hinted at something more. "If you're able, let me know your location. I've got new developments to share. I'd like to talk face-to-face. It's about the one who set you up."

Hannah and Vincent exchanged a sharp glance. Could there really be another lead?

"You've found something as well?" Her tone sharpened, all business. Claude let a heavy pause hang in the air before finally answering, "Yes. I think I've identified the person behind Miss Dubois' allergic reaction."

Those words hit Hannah with the force of a sudden storm. If Alice's allergy and the fire at VelaCore weren't orchestrated by the same people, then they were chasing two different threats.

A new sense of dread settled over Hannah. Claude's discovery was too important to dismiss. But she was already standing outside the factory, and if there was proof to be found here, this wasn't the time to walk away.

She took a steadying breath and replied with crisp urgency, "Claude, that's a critical lead. Thank you."

Keeping her tone light,'she continued, "Please take everything straight to the police. They need to move on it right away. Things here are tense-I'll reach out again as soon as possible."

Claude tried to push for more, sensing something was off. "What could possibly be more urgent-"

At that moment, Vincent stepped right beside Hannah, standing so close that their arms nearly brushed. His voice dropped to a commanding tone. "WVe're going."

The words carried through the line. A second later, Hannah ended the call.

Claude stood frozen, stunned by the realization that Vincent was with her. His hand clenched tight around his phone, veins standing out sharply across his skin.
###Chapter 317 Husband And Wife


Buzz! Claude's phone vibrated with another message from Hannah. "Claude, please take care of my parents. Just tell them I'm away on a short business trip, so they won't worry."

Claude immediately tried calling Hannah, but every call failed to connect.

"Huh..." Claude let out a bitter laugh, frustration and anger threading through the sound.

Ever since news of her release, he'd resisted the urge to rush to her side-all because he wanted to give her a perfect gift: the "truth" that would clear her name for good. He was ready to pay any price for this.

He hadn't really slept in days. Every waking hour, he'd thrown himself into building a rock-solid case to exonerate Hannah.

He'd rented out an entire floor of an exhibition hall, painstakingly reconstructing the makeup room and backstage area labeled as the′′pcoisoning scenee"-matching every camera angle, every light, every trash can, even the way the tiles reflected the glow. He'd found a desperate gambler, buried under debt, who owed him a fortune.

Claude had offered him a deal he couldn't refuse-to become the scapegoat for Alice's allergy incident.

The man had reenacted the scene on camera repeatedly until Claude was satisfied.

It took a massive toll on Claude's time and resources. He'd imagined the surprise in Hannah's eyes when she saw the evidence-maybe even admiration, maybe a new kind of trust.

But now? He'd called her, only to realize she was already with Vincent. Just hearing that left him reeling.

Bang! The glass in Claude's hand smashed against the wall, the expensive screen opposite him cracking into a spiderweb of damage.

At that moment, a cautious knock came. Owen stepped in, his voice tight with unease. "Mr. Hobbes, the plan's in motion. That man is ready to turn himself in within the hour." Claude spun, voice cold as ice. "Delay it."

Owen stared in shock. "D-Delay? But every/thing's set. If we hold off now-"

A humorless smile flickered on Claude's lips. "I said delay it. Didn't you hear me?"

Owen flinched, head bowing quickly. "Understood."

***

Meanwhile,Hannah and Vincent approached the factory gates at a measured pace.

"Stop! What do you want?" The security guard blocked their path, barking out his challenge.

Hannah's heart jumped, but her expression stayed composed. "Sir, we're here looking for work. We heard the factory's hiring and wanted to apply."

As she spoke, she nudged Vincent's arm with her elbow-a silent cue to play along.

The guard looked them up and down, suspicion clear in his eyes. "Looking for work, huh? What's your relationship?"

Hannah answered, "We're siblings."

Vincent, at the same time, said, "Husband and wife."

Their voices overlapped awkwardly.

The guard stared at them, incredulous. "One says siblings, the other says husband and wife." He raised his voice. "Are you playing games with me? Tell me the truth!"

He stepped closer, baton in hand, the threat obvious.

Hannah frowned. Such a small factory, yet so vigilant?

Vincent spoke up, voice low and calm but edged with steel. "She's just shy. We're married."

Playing along,Hannah gave him a playful smack on the arm. The guard hesitated but, with staffing shortages, eventually waved them forward toward HR.

The HR manager, Doyle Burgess, jotted down some notes on their forms, sizing them up. He seemed satisfied with Hannah, but as his gaze landed on Vincent, he hesitated. "This is dirty, backbreaking work.The smell isn't for everyone. Is your man up for it?"

Hannah's pulse raced. She forced a bright smile, answering quickly,"H′up for anything. Works hard,never complains-just a bit quiet, that's all."

She nudged Vincent again.

Vincent finally looked up, offering asimple grunt in agreement.

Doyle weighed his options. With so many workers recently transferred out, he decided to let Carville Graves,take them for a half-day trial.

But as they walked away, something nagged at Doyle. Suddenly, he realized-neither was wearing a wedding ring. He called out, "Wait."

Hannah and Vincent stoppoed in their tracks.

Doyle fixed them with a hard stare. "You say you're married, but neither of you has a wedding ring.Security,detain them!"

Around them, employees paused and slowly began to gather, curiosity piqued.

Hannah's hand moved toward her bracelet, ready to call for help, but Vincent stopped her, taking her hand."We actually do have them," he said.
###Chapter 318 My One And Only


Without warning, Vincent lifted his left hand, and the chill in his voice sliced through the heavy silence in the room.

A simple platinum band gleamed on his ring finger for all to see.

Both Doyle and the security guard locked their attention on the ring, caught off guard for a split second.

Yet, Doyle's doubt only deepened. A sneering laugh escaped him as he turned a pointed look on Hannah."Oh really? Where's her ring, then? Strange-she isn't wearing one. What, couldn't keep the act going?You two think I'm some kind of fool?"

A fresh wave of tension swept through the room.

The security guard tightened his grip on his baton looking to Doyle for a signal.Hannah noticed their stance shift-shoulders stiffening, eyes narrowing. Her pulse quickened, and she instinctively squeezed Vincent's hand tighter.

Vincent responded by gently tapping her fingers,silent reassurance in the small gesture.

Off to the side, a young worker with grease stains on his shirt piped up, watching the scene unfold with interest. "Come on,Doyle, isn't it obvious? He's got a ring, but she doesn't. Probably just his mistress-too scared to show it off in public."

Hannah's eyes flickered. That angle might actually work.

She dropped her gaze in an instant, her face flushing with calculated discomfort, every bit of her posture leaning into the part-nervous, flustered, lips slightly parted as though she were ready to give in and accept the humiliating role they'd forced on her. But just as the words hovered on the edge of her tongue,someone spoke up.

"She's not." Vincent's voice came steady and quiet, but it cut straight through the noise. In the next breath, he moved to stand in front of Hannah, his broad frame blocking her entirely from the harsh looks aimed her way.

His gaze locked on the worker who had thrown out the accusation-so cold and piercing that the worker quickly looked away, shrinking under the intensity.

Vincent turned back to Doyle, his words ringing with absolute certainty. "She's my wife. My one and only."Hannah stared at him, caught completely off guard
by his sudden declaration.

Vincent didn't give anyone a moment to react. He reached into his pocket and drew out a sparkling diamond ring.

The crowd gasped at the sight of the massive stone -until they noticed the couple's plain, worn clothing and quickly dismissed it as fake. Their astonishment faded into skepticism.

Vincent's focus never wavered. He gently took hold of Hannah's left hand. With every eye in the room locked on them, he slid the ring slowly onto her finger.

A flicker of surprise crossed Hannah's face-this was the same ring from the day he'd asked her to marry him again. He'd kept it on him all this time?

Now, when they needed it most, the ring had saved them. Hannah exhaled, finally letting herself relax.

Vincent offered a simple explanation, lifting his head to meet the group's stares. "She hasn't been wearing her ring because I had it."

He paused, letting the moment hang, and added a touch of self-deprecation. "We got into a pretty rough fight a while back. She was furious that I spent so much time at work and not enough with her. In a burst of anger, she threw the ring off our balcony and demanded a divorce. Took some effort, but I found it again."

He threw Hannah a quick look as he finished his story. The guard nodded, the puzzle now seemingly fitting together. "So that's why she claimed you two were siblings before. Sounds like you were just fighting.Makes sense."

Hannah played along, giving Vincent's arm a gentle smack. "Maybe you should try a little harder not to get on my nerves."

"I'll do better," Vincent promised, giving her hand a reassuring squeeze.

She squeezed back and managed a soft smile."Sorry for the drama, everyone."

The workers broke into laughter, their earlier suspicion dissolving.

Doyle made a face but gave up with a grunt."Fine.Just a stupid misunderstanding. What a headache."

He shot them one last glare, then turned and shouted toward the back. "Get moving! Carville, keep your eyes on these two. If they.start slacking, show them the door!" Hannah and Vincent shared a discreet look, both feeling the tension in their shoulders melt just a little.For the moment, the danger had passed.

Carville motioned them into one of the workshop bays and then gestured vaguely at a pile of goods stacked in the corner.

"You two-move these bags of detergent into the back warehouse. Check the labels and match them to the boxes. Each box has a warehouse number on the tag.Keep the stacks neat and move quickly."

They didn't answer and simply set to work in silence.

A little while later, Hannah used a short break to make small talk. "Strange, I haven't seen any other workers around."

The hours dragged on, and still, only the two of them handled the detergent bags.

Carville glanced at her out of the corner of his eye,his posture still hunched. "Around here? Ask too many questions and you won't live long. Got it?"Something in his voice sent a chill down her spine.She nodded right away. "Got it. I understand."

She started to go back to work, but Vincent reached out and stopped her. "Take a breather. Let me take care of this part."

A sly smile played on Carville's lips. "What a thoughtful husband."

Carville turned and made his way toward Doyle's office,leaving them to their task.

The moment Doyle caught sight of Carville, he stood up straight. "Boss."

Carville dropped the act, his back straightening as he settled into the office chair. He kept his voice low."Still one man short for that shipment tonight?"

"Yeah." Doyle confirmed with a nod.

With his eyes closed, Carville sounded almost bored."Send a few guys to rape the woman. Make sure the man sees it. I want to know if he's got any fight in him. If he does, let's see if he can handle a run."
###Chapter 319 | Think They Were Testing My Skills
Once Carville was out of sight, Hannah leaned in to speak with Vincent. She lowered her voice and quickly shared her observations about the suspicious chemical barrels she had seen while moving supplies.

Suddenly, the quiet was shattered by rough,mocking laughter.

A group of six burly men swaggered over, the smell of sweat and cheap booze hanging around them. All their attention locked on Hannah.

The one in front, teeth stained yellow, grinned wide. "Hey there, pretty thing. Why not join us for some fun?"

"Yeah, come on, sweetheart. We'll show you a good time tonight," another chimed in, his words thick with sleaze.

"Look at that slim waist... Bet it feels even better up close."

Hannah's expression hardened instantly-not out of fear, but from a sharp, rising anger at their crudeness.

The energy around Vincent shifted, growing colder and far more dangerous as he moved in front of Hannah to shield her."You really want to start something?" His voice was low, every word edged with a promise of violence.

The leader swallowed nervously at the look in Vincent's eyes,but his confidence returned with his crew at his back. He sneered sharply, "Guys, take him down! Then we'll have our fun with his woman right in front of him-that's what I call excitement!"

With a howl, the group surged forward. Vincent's movements blurred-he darted between the first two,grabbing one attacker by the wrist and wrenching it until a sickening crack echoed, followed by a scream of pain.

His right leg swept out in a precise arc, catching another thug square in the ribs and sending him crashing to the ground.

Not a single motion wasted, Vincent dropped two opponents in mere seconds.

Hannah stood right behind him, not flinching, not losing her focus. She kept her eyes open, assessing every move. As Vincent dispatched the first pair, a man tried to exploit the chaos,swinging a heavy club at Vincent's exposed back.

"Look out!" Hannah yelled, her voice slicing through the chaos.

She dropped low, grabbed a bag of laundry powder from the pile, and hurled it straight at the attacker with all the force she could muster.

Whoosh! White powder burst in every direction, clouding the entire workshop in a thick, chalky haze.

"Move!" she shouted, grabbing Vincent's arm as he stumbled backward from the momentum of his last strike.

Vincent caught on immediately, reversing his grip to hold her wrist.

The two of them tore through the swirling dust, racing for a quiet corner out of sight.

"Don't let them escape!"

"Go after them! Don't let them get away!"

Shouts and coughing trailed them, angry voices echoing through the smoke.

While they ran, Vincent spoke in short bursts, his breathing While they ran, Vincent spoke in short bursts, his breathing quick but his words sharp. "These aren't just random thugs, see how steady they are? Their moves are practiced. They're trained, almost like soldiers. I think they were testing my skills."

A jolt of fear ran through Hannah. Why would anyone be testing Vincent's strength?

At that moment, a sharp voice rang out, hoarse and hurried."This way! Quickly! Follow me!" The sound came from somewhere behind a pile of old, rust-stained oil barrels.

It was Carville. He appeared, hunched over and waving them toward him, anxiety plain on his face. "There's a hidden door this way. It leads outside. They won't catch you-quickly,before they come!"

Hannah's brow furrowed. "Why are you helping us?"

Carville let out a heavy sigh. "Those men have done the same thing to my daughter. I can't stand by anymore."

Vincent and Hannah locked eyes, reading the same question in each other's gaze, and then made a split-second decision to trust Carville.

They slipped through a hidden iron door that Carville revealed behind the barrels.

A narrow passage stretched beyond the threshold, thick with the musty scent of mold and rust. Dimn light barely lit their way.

Carville hurried ahead, glancing back to urge them along."Keep moving! You're safe here!"

Vincent gripped Hannah's hand firmly, his eyes scanning every shadow as they moved.

After running for several dozen meters, the passage abruptly widened. What greeted them next made their eyes widen in disbelief.

There was no exit-only an underground prison.

Rows of steel bars carved the space into dozens of cages.Inside each cage, a woman huddled. Ages varied wildly,from teenagers to women in their thirties or forties. Every one of them wore tattered clothes, their faces blank and eyes lifeless.

A gasp escaped Hannah, ice creeping up her spine as she realized what they'd found.

Vincent spun, ready to pull her back the way they'd come.

But in that instant, a powerful force ripped them apart.

Clang! A deafening crash rang out as metal slammed down overhead. A heavy cage dropped from above, landing with perfect precision to trap Hannah inside.

The lock snapped shut with a sharp, mechanical click.

Fury burned in Vincent's eyes as he dove toward the bars, his hands gripping the cold steel. But he was already too late.

Carville straightened, no longer hunched, his lips curling into a cold,menacing smile.

Shaking her head at Vincent, Hannah faced Carville squarely."You led us here on purpose. What are you really after?"
###Chapter 320 He Won


"What am I after?" Carville strolled forward, taking his time, relishing the rage sparking in Vincent's eyes. "Those clowns outside? Worthless. We'll have to run the show again."

Carville was displeased. Doyle's standards had slipped lately-always sending amateurs to do a job that demanded real muscle.

The thought only made Carville's smile more menacing. He raised a bony finger, pointing into the gloom at the far end of the underground space.Three enormous men stepped out of the shadows,their physiques almost grotesque-shoulders broad,muscles straining against their shirts.

Carville looked back at Vincent, his smile turning cruel. "You'll fight those three. If you win, you and your woman w alk out of here. Hell, I might even let you lead a crew." His gaze slid to Hannah, predatory. "But if you lose...Well, someone as pretty as her?" His voice went low and ugly. "Those three will get their prize. They have a thing for soft skin."

A lethal chill radiated from Vincent. He would never let anyone lay a finger on Hannah.

"Darling!" Hannah called from inside the cage.She had to call Vincent that, just to keep their cover intact.

Vincent turned, meeting her eyes. She mouthed, "Be careful."

With a glance, she signaled her wristband-a silent warning: she could call for help if needed.

Vincent understood, offering a faint, steady smile."Don't worry."

Then, he faced forward. He shrugged off his jacket in one smooth motion. There was no choice-he had to win.

The three men closed in, letting out guttural growls. Their attacks came fast and ruthless-trained, not random. They fought with practiced brutality, their fists a blur, striking in perfect sync.

Vincent was engulfed in a hail of blows. He dodged,twisted, parried-moving with sharp, economical precision. Each block rattled through his bones.

He wasn't rushing to finish it. Not yet. He watched,learning the pattern of their steps, listening for the labored breaths, tracking each subtle imbalance.

But no one could avoid every blow. A fist smashed into his shoulder. A kick slammed into his ribs. Blood dripped from his mouth. He let his pace slow,deliberately.

Across the room, Carville narrowed his eyes.Predictable. This new guy was losing. Doyle had brought the wrong men yet again.

Hannah's heart hammered. Her hand hovered over the emergency button.

Vincent caught her eye and gave a tiny shake of his
head. He was merely bidding for the right moment.

Hannah drew her hand away, biting her lip, forcing herself to trust him.

One brute launched a high, whistling kick at Vincent's head.

Vincent ducked low-the kick missed, and he exploded upward, driving his fist straight into the attacker's jaw.

Crack! The sickening sound echoed through the air.

The man dropped, unconscious before he hit the floor.

The remaining two froze for an instant, stunned.

That was it. Vincent seized the opening. He lunged for the slower one, seized the latter's outstretched arm,and-turning with brutal efficiency-hurled him over his shoulder, slamming him to the floor.

The man writhed, trying to recover, but Vincent stomped down hard on his shin. The bone snapped the man's scream bouncing off the walls.

The last man roared, charging in a wild frenzy. It was an all-out brawl now.

Vincent braced, every muscle burning. He met the attack head-on, trading blows, each strike more forceful than the last.

The heavy thuds of fists on flesh rang out in the dark.

Blood streaked Vincent's mouth, but he never faltered. His punches landed with increasing weight,battering his opponent backward step by step.

Finally, with a surge of all his remaining strength,Vincent drove his fist into the man's chest.

The brute gagged, spat blood, and collapsed.

Vincent won.

Silence then fell.

The women in the cage-blank, defeated-turned their heads, their faces barely changing. They just watched. Vincent dropped to one knee, breath ragged, hand pressed to the floor for support. After a long moment, he forced himself upright, chest heaving.He glanced at Hannah, giving her a steady nod.

Tears welled in Hannah's eyes as the fear finally ebbed away.

Vincent turned his ice-cold stare on Carville. His voice, rough and unyielding, cut through the air. "I won.Let her out."

###Chapter 321 Sick Of The Lovey-dovey Crap Yet
Carville's crooked grin widened. "Impressive." His throat grated harshly. "You've passed. Nine tonight.Meet behind the warehouse."

"I told you to release my wife!" Vincent stepped forward, tone slicing like a blade.

"Why the hurry?" Carville jeered, glancing at Hannah trapped behind the bars. "Miss the job or get clever,and she's not making it to morning."

Vincent's hand launched forward-freezing just short of Carville's face.

"Thinking about swinging?" A tic twitched beneath Carville's wrinkled features. "Better save it. Whether you like it or not, your woman is staying put."

"You-" Fury flooded Vincent like a surging wave,shaking the edge of his control. "Sweetheart!" Hannah's soft, serene voice drifted through-steady, calm, strangely comforting.

Vincent pivoted. Their gazes locked, and in that wordless moment, everything was said. She was telling him to breathe, to hold back.

Vincent's breath came fast, but the lethal fire behind his eyes slowly dimmed.

Hannah shifted her focus to Carville, her words dipped in calculated worry and seemingly forced acceptance. "My husband... He won't get hurt doing this,will he?"

She posed the question carefully, like a typical wife concerned for her spouse.

Carville glanced between Hannah and Vincent. He curled his lip. "Hard to say. That's up to fate."

Hannah quickly adopted an uneasy look, but then-like a thought had struck her-she added, "There's payment, right? We're out here working to earn money."A flicker of contempt sparked in Carville's stare,swiftly buried. Yet, he looked appeased by her grounded, naive mindset. "There is," he muttered."Do your part, and you'll see some."

"Great, then!" Hannah nodded with visible, measured relief and faced Vincent, her tone bright with naive optimism. "Do your best and earn well!"

Then, she subtly moved her lips in a way only Vincent could see. "Be safe." She mouthed.

Vincent's chest tightened. He held her stare a moment longer and then mouthed silently in return."You too."

"Sick of the lovey-dovey crap yet?" Carville interrupted with a scowl, every word steeped in revulsion. "That's enough! You get one hour of visiting time per day. Let's move! The clock's ticking,and this haul's too valuable."

Vincent gave Hannah one lingering glance through the metal enclosure. His features spoke of anguish,resolve, and fierce devotion. Then,he forced himself to turn on his heel. He didn't glance back. He trailed Carville down the dim passage.



Vincent was taken to a crude sleeping area far inside the industrial site.

Calling it sleeping quarters was generous-it resembled a storage shed cluttered with thin mattresses.

Roughly a dozen men lay scattered about, snoring so violently that the air seemed to tremble,unresponsive to Vincent's presence.

Carville lobbed Vincent a ragged gauze roll and a tiny vial of low-quality antiseptic. "Sort it out yourself," he said coolly before striding away.

Vincent wordlessly claimed a vacant spot in the corner.He cleaned and dressed his injuries with little care.

At exactly 8:50 p.m., the door creaked open.
Carville reappeared, flanked by two stiff, hostile-looking men with steely gazes. "Move it," he barked.

Vincent obeyed silently and stepped behind them.

The innermost halls of the plant were eerily still. They navigated rusted conduits and shadowed paths until arriving at a covered gateway hidden behind a thick tarp.

Seven men stood at attention, all wearing the same vicious,predatory stare.

Carville accepted a package coated in oiled cloth from one of the guards and pressed it into Vincent's grip. "Here," he murmured. "You know what to do with this?"

Vincent pulled back the wrap to expose a Glock 17,surprisingly clean. With no sign of reaction, he checked the clip-full capacity-then snapped the slide back to chamber a shot. He slipped it into his waistband. His every move was cold, deliberate, and automatic.
Carville's gaze narrowed, a faint glint emerging in his eyes. "Get in," he said, motioning Vincent forward.

As Vincent passed under the heavy fabric, his jaw clenched in disbelief. WVhat he walked into-was beyond anything he'd imagined.
###Chapter 322 All Dead


The space beyond the door revealed itself as the entrance to a sprawling, sloped mineshaft.

Inside, the mine was split clearly into two sections.

On the left, about a dozen workers dressed in identical blue uniforms and wearing masks stood at a conveyor belt, working with dull routine. The belt was crowded with cosmetic ingredients and half-finished products-the same things Hannah had noticed earlier in the day.

Across the way, the right side was a whole different world.

More than twenty shirtless men, their muscles straining, hacked away at the rock with rough tools.They weren't pulling up regular ore. Instead,they dug out a rare mineral that shimmered with a faint,dark-green glow.
Cosmetic manufacturing. Illegal mineral mining.

In an instant, Vincent put all the pieces together. No wonder they needed so much muscle down here-these men were guarding this illegal mineral vein.With something this rare and precious, trouble from thieves or internal fighting was bound to follow.

Their soap and detergent operation on the surface was just a smokescreen. The racket and chemical smells above made it easy to keep what happened below hidden. And those unregulated beauty products-there was no question they were dangerous. Alice's poisoning most likely traced straight back to the questionable products here.

"You." Carville glanced at Vincent, and his voice snapped out, pointing at a foreman with a long scar across his face. "You're with Rayden now. Do exactly what he tells you."

Carville's gaze shifted to the gun on Vincent's hip,and his voice turned cold. "That gun's not for show.It's for keeping things in line. If you spot anyone who doesn't belong, or if someone gets greedy for the  minerals..."

Carville dragged his thumb across his throat,eyes cold and hard. "Take them out."

Vincent simply nodded, his face giving nothing away.He trailed after Rayden Holt, the scar-faced foreman,following him deeper into the tunnel.

Minutes crawled past. At last, the final load of those glowing green minerals was sealed in thick lead boxes, placed on a padded cart, and covered with a heavy camouflage tarp.

Rayden gave the order for the cart to move, and Vincent almost let out a sigh, thinking the shift would end quietly.

Suddenly, sharp cracks of gunfire tore through the air. Bang! Bang! Bang!

"Guard the shipment!" Rayden reacted without hesitation, shoving the closest worker aside and rolling behind a thick  stone pillar, pistol already in hand As soon as gunfire broke out, Vincent moved fast-he didn't duck away but dove straight behind a jagged rock, using it as a shield.

He took a split second to size things up. The attackers wanted the minerals. There were at least half a dozen of them, heavily armed and clearly organized. Their sights were set on the cargo they'd just loaded.

Vincent held off on using his gun. He scanned the chaos, counting the number of assailants, watching for danger zones, and looking for any gaps he could exploit.

One of the attackers broke away from the rest, eager to be the hero. He dashed toward the cart, a submachine gun at the ready.

Rayden screamed, "I'll put a bullet through your skull!" He opened fire, but his shots just bounced off the attacker's armored vest, only slowing him a little.

The attacker was nearly at the cart when a single gunshot rang out from somewhere else. Blood spurted from his wrist-the hand gripping the weapon.

Rayden seized the opening. He squeezed the trigger again. The attacker collapsed in an instant.

Startled, Rayden glanced toward the source of that precise shot. It was Vincent. He gave Vincent a brief nod and spun back into the fight.

The shootout didn't last long, but it was vicious.

Just as Vincent was running low on ammunition, the attackers finally retreated.

Bodies from both sides littered the ground.

Rayden sagged against the pillar, chest heaving blood dripping down his arm. He turned to Vincent."You handle yourself well with a gun. That's not the work of an amateur."

Rayden made his way over, gun raised, and pressed the barrel to Vincent's forehead, searching his face for any hint of fear. "So-what did you do before all this?" Vincent stayed still, not a hint of fear in his eyes. He exhaled slowly, every bit the man who had nothing left to lose. "Used to work the borderlands," he replied, voice steady. "Blood paid my bills. You do not last long in that world unless you learn how to survive."

Rayden narrowed his gaze and then relaxed just a bit.Someone with a background like that could easily be turned into a weapon. "You've got guts," he said,dropping his gun and extending his hand. "Give the gun back. Inventory has to be logged."

Vincent handed the pistol over, making a mental note of where Rayden stored it.

As Rayden secured the weapon, Vincent didn't bother with small talk. "When do I get to see my woman?"

Rubbing his aching shoulder, Rayden let out a short laugh. "What, you in that much of a hurry? Can't even wait a night?" He tipped his chin toward the exit. "Get some sleep. Tomorrow after lunch, thee's
a two-hour window for visits." He made it sound like it was policy. "Relax-she's in the cage, not a scratch on her."

Safe? To Vincent, that was no comfort at all. It was more like a warning.

Vincent's eyes turned icy, cold enough to cut.He kept his head low, hiding whatever he felt, and nodded quietly.

Meanwhile,inside the cage underground, Hannah sat on the hard floor, her back pressed to the iron bars.Her sharp eyes moved from cell to cell, taking in each woman around her.

"Quit looking," an older woman murmured. "Our men are all dead. In here, we're nothing but their playthings."
###Chapter 323 Pretty Thing


The woman's name was Delia Faulkner, and she had long lost count of how many days she'd spent confined in this nightmare. Her expression was dry and unmoved, a lifeless calm drenching her. "If those men's lusts aren't satisfied..." she murmured,sounding empty, "we'll be tossed aside like broken tools."

With brutal bluntness, she exposed the reality of this underground cell block-wringing every scrap of worth from a woman's form.

A cold shudder ran through Hannah. Rage swelled under her ribs, sharpening her focus and hardening her eyes.

"Don't lose faith," Hannah declared, steady and composed. "We're leaving. Every last one of us."

"Leaving? By what miracle?" On the opposite side of the pen, someone who'd remained mute until now finally lifted her gazo. The scars on her face told too many stories-some barely visible, others fresh and furious. This was Elsa Douglas.

Her mouth curled into something between disgust and pity. "Look around you. We're chained like strays, no better than livestock. You've got no room to even stretch. Hah, dreaming about escape...You're delusional."

Her sentence darkened the air, smothering hope with its weight, followed by broken sobs muffled in sleeves. A few of the women shrank even further into themselves.

Hannah looked at Delia. "Who's in charge of this hell?"

Delia stalled, scanning the cell before she leaned in."Carville. He's at the top. No heart, all malice.Everyone reports to him."

Carville. Hannah's lips pulled into a humorless smirk.That man, cunning as a fox, had played her and Vincent from the very beginning. Delia hesitated, choosing her next words with care.Then,she met Hannah's steady gaze, voice dropping to a secretive murmur. "And there's Doyle. He's head of personnel. On paper, he takes orders from Carville, but they don't get along. Doyle talks when he drinks-says Carville's a greedy control freak,always hogging the rewards from the mining spoils.Doyle thinks he's owed more."

Something bitter flickered in Delia's stare.

"'They don't get along,'" Hannah echoed under her breath. "That's promising." A daring gleam kindled in her eyes.

"What's promising about that?" Elsa scoffed, her tone sharp and frigid.

Hannah turned toward the women, her words low but electric with urgency. "If we can twist that rivalry into a war-force them to claw at each other's throats-that's our window!"

"Big talk," Delia rasped, voice weighed down by skepticism. "You think it's that easy?" She gestured toward the looming darkness beyond the bars."Those two are seasoned predators. You believe you can outmaneuver them?"

"| know I can't do it without help," Hannah said,scanning every face in the cell. "But together?Together, we've got a shot."

Elsa snorted."Keep dreaming. We're not winning this game."

"I understand your concern," Hannah replied, her voice gentle but firm. "I won't even ask all of you to join. If your heart says this is suicide..." Her tone grew tender. "Then stay quiet. Bury this moment deep."She placed a hand on her chest.

Then, her stare burned into Delia, then Elsa-whose hardened glare flickered, touched by something faint and new-and the few others whose eyes caught the spark like fragile tinder.

"But if there's any fire left in you," Hannah urged,"even a flicker that wants freedom, then act. Try anything. No matter how small. For your own sake." The silence that followed was thick and heavy,broken only by breaths too shallow to steady the nerves.

None of them replied. Their eyes were hollowed,frozen in despair.

Then came the tap-tap of leather on concrete, slicing through the hush, and Hannah clamped down on her next sentence. Already time for the "visits?"

The reinforced entrance groaned open, and a man of average height staggered through. The stench of liquor clung to him, and his smirk reeked of filth.

This was Marion Larson. Doyle's lackey, in charge of this underground cell. Yes, he would make out with any captive he liked. And he always ignored work shifts and dropped by whenever his desires took him.

"Well, well. Look at this pretty little thing," Marion slurred, licking cracked lips. His lustful eyes fixed on Hannah as he ambled over, fingers already unlocking the latch. "You. Out. You're mine tonight." He lunged to seize her wrist.

"Marion!" Delia's trembling voice rose from a far corner. Thin, almost broken, but enough to stall him."Her husband... He's still alive! The new one, the one who can fight! The visiting hour is soon-this... This isn't a good idea."

"Not a good idea?" Marion scoffed, shooting her a look full of mockery. "Says who? Once you're caged,you're open season. So what if I take his bride for a bit of fun? What's he gonna do-cry?"
###Chapter 324 She Had The Guts To Fight Back
While Marion continued his monologue, Hannah's cold stare caught the shine of a hunting knife tucked into his waistband.

"Marion, weren't you the one who said I was your favorite?" From another cage, Elsa managed to speak up, her voice trembling as she forced herself through a wave of nausea, hoping to distract him.

Marion didn't even bother to look her way. "Shut up,you filthy bitch!" he snapped, keeping his gaze fixed on Hannah. "Now, this one-she's got a face. Fresh meat like that? I get the first round tonight."

Without warning, he shoved the cage open and grabbed Hannah's arm, dragging her forward with rough hands.

No scream escaped Hannah's lips. She did't even try to pull away. Every bit of emotion had been hammered flat, replaced with a cchilling, almost clinical calm.

Hannah let herself be yanked forward a few paces-just until she reached the edge of the cage. Right before he could haul her all the way out, she stopped and tilted her head. "Here's fine."

A finger pointed to a bare spot on the cage floor. "Lie down there. I'll undress you."

Marion hesitated for half a second and then burst out laughing. "Oh, I get it-you like to be watched, is that it?"

His excitement made his face flush red, spit flying as he spoke. "You've got a wild streak. I like that-makes this more fun!"

He released her arm and sprawled onto the dirty straw mat, spreading his arms wide and taunting,"Come on, baby, let's see what you've got."

Disgust twisted in Hannah's stomach. But nothing on  her face betrayed it. She sank into a crouch,inching closer. Her gaze zeroed in on the knife hilt pressed against his back.

She reached out, hands moving as if to undo his belt,and then, at the last possible second, her grip shot to his waist. In one quick motion, she grabbed the knife handle, and yanked it free.

Marion didn't even have time for his grin to fade before-Shlunk! A dull, wet sound of metal piercing flesh echoed around the underground cells.

With both hands locked tight on the knife's handle,Hannah shoved the blade deep into his unguarded stomach, channeling every bit of her strength and focus. She'd aimed for a spot that would drop him instantly-pain and paralysis would be immediate.

"Ghh-" Marion's eyes bulged, his throat strangling on a half-formed cry.

A spray of hot blood burst from the wound, flinging crimson across Hannah's cool, steady face.
Sudden silence took hold, swallowing the row of cages. Women stared in open-mouthed shock,barely breathing.

Nothing changed in Hannah's expression. Working quickly, she snatched his own belt and wrapped it tight around his wrists, tying him securely behind his back. A ripped piece of his shirt became a gag,which she stuffed in his mouth without a word.

Hannah turned to Delia, keeping her tone as cold and steady as ever. "Is there a place to hide him?"

Delia blinked away her daze and nodded at the far end of the cages. "That way... There's an old air duct nobody goes near. Half of it is caved in, real deep."

Without pausing, Hannah dragged Marion's limp body across the dirty floor, shoved him into the narrow duct, and rolled several heavy stones to hide the opening. It would look untouched to anyone passing by.

She hurried back to the center of the cage, found a battered bucket filled with stagnant water, tore a
 strip from her own clothes, and wiped away the brightest streaks of blood from the floor and straw.

After cleaning, she walked over to the cage door,grabbed the chain from the ground, and closed the door behind her with a quiet pull.

Only then did she turn back, pressing herself against the iron bars, facing the silent crowd of women still watching her.

"Now, do you believe me?" Hannah asked, her voice low but steady, echoing through the hush.

Fear lingered in the other women's faces, but something new began to flicker in their eyes. Hannah had shown them exactly what she was made of-there was no doubting her resolve now. She had the guts to fight back.

At last, a soft voice broke through the silence. Nina Corwin, the youngest among them and still curled in a corner, spoke up. "So what do we do next?"
###Chapter 325 Have To Get TheseWomen Out
A new sense of purpose filled Hannah's chest.Dropping her voice, she gave fast, clear instructions."Here's the plan. Each day, they allow a visitation period, right? All we have to do is let a few 'rumors'slip out-just some carefully planted gossip."

Pausing, she explained, "For example, 'I heard Doyle's got his own crew waiting outside the factory,maybe getting ready for something big...' Or try this,I overheard Carville plotting a new deal without Doyle, planning to leave him out completely... I just happened to catch it.

She met their eyes one by one. "You need to make it sound casual. Like you're just complaining or chatting. Never sound like you're reporting anything important. Just let it drop and move on. Your goal is to plant seeds of doubt, nothing more. If someone asks questions, just cry, say you can't remember,or go silent. Act clueless. Protect yourselves above everything."

She went over everything again in detail,making sure everyone understood. A few of the women started nodding along.

"Cutting Doyle out of the deal..." Delia whispered the phrase to herself, slowly repeating it as if testing its weight, a flicker of clarity beginning to spark in her eyes.

"I can do it," Nina said, her voice trembling but sure.Tears streaked her cheeks, yet her fists stayed clenched.

Delia took a breath and then nodded hard. "Let's go for it. There's nothing left to lose."

Elsa gave a sharp snort but stayed silent, offering no argument.

The other women didn't speak, but something had changed-there was no resistance left in their eyes.
Hannah saw the shift as determination began to light up their faces, and the tightness inside her finally eased.

The minutes slipped away. The time for visitation drew closer.

Hannah was sure Vincent would come for her. She needed him to set the plan in motion.

Then it came.

A heavy iron door crashed open, sending in a wave of air thick with sweat and rot. A pack of men stomped inside, radiating crude hunger, their laughter loud and ugly.

Instantly, the quiet prison turned into a nightmare.

"Get over here, you slut!"

"It's my night with her!"

"Scream again and I'll break your neck!"

Yells and howls filled the air. The crack of fists on flesh, desperate cries, curses, and jeers-the womenwere dragged, hit, mocked, and assaulted. Chaos tore through the room.

Hannah pressed herself to the cell door, her fingers gripping the bars so tightly that her knuckles turned white. Rage boiled inside her, almost too much to contain. All she wanted was to tear every one of these monsters limb from limb.

Just then, Vincent appeared at her cell. He reached out and gently covered her eyes with his hand, warm and steady. "Don't watch."

Hannah tensed up. That voice-those words-they threw her back to the day Darren had tried to rape her. Vincent had been the one to find her then,whispering the very same thing, "Don't look. It's disgusting."

Something deep inside her shifted, loosening just a bit.

Vincent's broad shoulders blocked her completely from the violence and filth behind him. He saw the blood smeared across her cheek. A dark,dangerous fury flashed in his eyes, silent but deadly.He held the rage inside and forced it down. Raising his arm, he used the clean part of his sleeve to softly wipe the blood from her cheek.

"Has anyone come looking?" he murmured,his voice barely above a whisper, meant for her alone.

She turned her head just slightly, meeting his eyes with unshaken calm. "Someone did. I stabbed him.He's hidden."

Vincent's hand paused for a split second and then continued, still gentle and careful. "Good. Keep yourself out of harm's way."

The screams inside the underground cell block,mixed with lewd laughter and cries, rang out like a chorus of hell.

Hannah couldn't tune out the voices, so she forced herself to keep his attention on Vincent. Drawing a breath, she said quietly, "I need to tell you something." "I found the product that caused Alice's allergic reaction," Vincent, at the same time, said.

The words landed at the same time, and both of them stopped, caught off guard.

A flicker of surprise ran through Vincent's eyes before he continued, "'I found stacks of finished and half-finished products. The ingredients are a perfect match for the banned substance in Alice's report.Everything lines up-the whole chain of evidence."

A surge of hope colored Hannah's words. "We can go straight to the police! But before anything else,we have to get these women out. Every last one of them."

Her voice dropped even lower. "There are two main factions here-Doyle's group and Carville's. They barely trust each other. I've already started working with the women-"

"Turn them against each other," Vincent interjected,his eyes cold with determination as he caught on to her plan immediately.
She nodded once. "That's right. We just need to plant the seeds of doubt and let suspicion do the rest."

A cold smile touched Vincent's mouth. "Then let me set things off," he said, his gaze sharp as steel. "We'll sabotage tonight's shipment-make Carville's men think Doyle's crew did it. The moment the fuse is lit,this place will blow itself apart." 
###Chapter 326 Each Other's Only Ally


"That's the plan!" Hannah said, nodding sharply.Her eyes shone with determination as they gazed up at Vincent. "As soon as the fight breaks out, I'll hit the emergency button on my wristband and the police wvill show up."

Back when they entered the factory, the tight security had made Hannah wary. She'd been forced to leave her pepper spray and micro camera behind at the entrance. Fortunately, the wristband had stayed hidden. She had tucked it deep inside her loose sleeve, slipping past inspection unnoticed.

Vincent wasted no time. He sketched out the factory's layout and explained the late-night shift,keeping his voice low.

Dropping his tone even further, he leaned closer."I have to hand over this key or someone will get suspicious. But the latch won't really be locked. You'l be able to push the door open from inside."

Hannah immediately understood. "Alright." She nodded, locking eyes with him. "Tell me, where are the other keys? The ones for the other girls' cages?"

Vincent instantly caught on. She planned to free the others in the middle of the chaos. Tension crept into his face. "You don't realize how risky that is."

"We have to split up if we want to move fast," Hannah replied, her tone steady. "You'll start the commotion.I'll get the girls out. That's the only way this works."

Vincent studied her, searching her expression. He found unwavering resolve in her stare. After a long beat, he finally relented. Leaning in, he whispered quickly, "There's a cabinet next to the iron door,right by the workshop entrance. You'll find the keys inside.Try 5588 or maybe 6778. Not certain. The night shift leaves security stretched thin."

A glimpse was all he'd managed, but that was enough for the plan.
Hannah dipped her head. "I understand," she said quietly.

Vincent lingered a moment, and then his expression grew more intense. "Don't let anything happen to you," he said.

She faced him, unwavering. "I'll be fine. What about you? How are you holding up?"

A crooked smile flickered across his lips. "A scratch is all I'll get."

For a few seconds, neither said a word. The silence felt heavy, tense with things left unsaid.

Suddenly, a voice cut through the stillness. "Break's over! Get moving!" shouted the supervisor from just outside.

A shadow flickered across Vincent's face. He had to go. He cast her one last, unreadable glance.

Just as he turned to leave, he seemed to make a sudden decision. Instead of leaving, he spun back and pulled her close, holding her in a grip that left nospace for doubt.

Hannah's body went rigid. The hug was too sudden.too forceful. Her first instinct was to pull away-but then she felt the taut line of his body, the raw tension running through him. Something cracked inside her.

A heartbeat slipped by, uncertain. Eventually, she found herself returning the gesture. Her arms,hesitant at first, encircled his back and held on tight.

No one else in this forsaken place could be trusted.At that moment, they were each other's only ally,bound by the need to survive.

Vincent recognized her trust. A faint shiver rippled through him as he felt her arms tighten. In the next instant, he pulled her in even tighter.

Suddenly, he released her, pulled the cage door "shut," and walked away with purpose.

His departure signaled the others. One by one, the other men filed out, and the quiet swallowed up the underground cell again. Delia's face betrayed her misery. Her eyes were puffy and wet, and a red mark bloomed angrily on her cheek. "So, what's our next move?" she whispered.

The seeds of suspicion had already been quietly sown.

Pressing herself against the icy bars, Hannah let her eyes close for just a moment. "We have to wait. We wait until they head back to work."

She opened her eyes, meeting the anxious gazes of the women around her. Fear and hope mingled in their silence.

Words seemed useless. Only patience remained.

Minutes crawled by, thick and unbearable.

Eventually, urgent footsteps rumbled past the iron door, hurried and sharp.

Without thinking, Hannah jumped up and hurried to the bars, tipping her head to catch every sound.

"Does that mean they're finally heading back to work?" Hannah whispered, eyes darting to Delia, the most experienced among them.

Delia nodded vigorously, a glint of excitement and tension lighting her weary eyes. "Yes. No mistake.This is when they move in the biggest numbers-loudest it ever gets."

The moment had finally come.

Without a word, Hannah steadied herself, walked to the barred door, and let her fingers curl around the chain that barely held it shut. She eased the chain free, and the lock surrendered with a soft snap.Freedom beckoned.

Elsa's gasp cut through the tension, fear spilling from her voice. "Wait, what are you doing? Are you just going to leave us behind?"

Refusing to look back, Hannah spoke with quiet certainty. "I'm going for the keys. No one gets left here. I'll come back for everyone."

Worry tightened Delia's features, her words trembling. "Can you really pull this off?"

"There's no other choice," Hannah said, her determination clear. She moved along the wall,pressing herself into every shadow as she slipped toward the exit.

Nina clung to the bars, fear written on her face. She called out, voice barely above a whisper, "Please,don't get caught."

A gentle promise left Hannah's lips. "I'll be careful,"she said, her voice soft but certain, and she disappeared into the corridor.

Those left behind waited in heavy silence, time dragging by as hope battled anxiety.

Shouts and footsteps finally echoed through the underground chamber again, making every heart race. But it wasn't Hannah.

Instead, a man appeared. It was Malcolm Larson,broad-shouldered and cold-eyed. His gaze drifted lazily from cage to cage, clearly searching forsomething out of place.

"Where's Marion?" Malcolm yelped, his voice rough as gravel. "Wasn't he supposed to be here messing around? Did anyone see where he went?"
###Chapter 327 Mayhem Erupted


Hannah's cage was wedged deep in the shadows against the far wall, nearly swallowed by darkness.

At first glance, Malcolm barely registered that Hannah was missing.

But Nina, the closest girl, suddenly jerked her head up. Her voice cracked with panic, rising several octaves. "Marion-he's not here!"

"Not here? Then why the hell are you screaming?"Malcolm flinched, clutching his chest. "Nearly gave me a damn heart attack."

He scowled and then realized something about Nina's outburst didn't sit right. His eyes narrowed as suspicion crept in. He edged closer, tone dangerously quiet. "You're acting really strange.What are you so jumpy for?"

His eyes swept over each woman, sharp and searching. Then, when his eyes fell on the cage buried in darkness, he stopped dead. The spot where Hannah was supposed to be-was glaringly empty.

Malcolm's face contorted with rage, his eyes burning with a savage blaze. "A woman was supposed to be over there. Where the fuck is she? Did she run?"

All the women cowered, recoiling in terror. This was it -they were finished.

Malcolm surged forward and clamped his hand around Nina's throat. "Who let her out? Answer me!"

Nina's mouth opened, but her words never came.Her eyes widened in shock.

A shadow appeared behind Malcolm. Hannah had returned.

A sharp, resounding blow struuck Malcolm's skull. He crumpled without a sound, crashing to the stone floor.

The underground cell was plunged into stunned,unbroken silence. A stunned silence lingered in the  the women stared, chests tight, adrenaline roaring in their veins. In a dizzying surge, fear gave way to shock, then pure, breathless exhilaration as the reality of what had happened set in.

Hannah struggled to steady her breathing, her chest rising and falling, the club shaking slightly in her grip.

Sweat dampened her brow. That damn cabinet had slowed her down-the antique combination lock had nearly gotten the better of her.

Only after finally wrangling the keyring free had she whirled around and spotted Malcolm stalking toward the cages. On instinct, she'd seized the nearest rod,crept up behind him, and waited, muscles coiled, for the exact right moment. Her timing, mercifully, had been flawless-a single, decisive blow.

Delia was the first to come to her senses. Her voice rasped through the hush, barely above a whisper."Did you... Did you get the keys?"

Hannah let out a long, shaky breath and fished the keys from her pocket, holding them up so everyone could see. "Yeah. I've got them."

Relief swept through all the women like a breaking wave.

"Oh,thank God!"

"We're saved-this is real, we're actually saved!"

Tears finally spilled over, the dam inside breaking in helpless, ragged sobs.

"Shhh!" Hannah hissed, urgency sharpening her gesture as she raised a hand. "Stay quiet. I'm getting you out."

She darted to the nearest cage, scanning the numbered locks. Snatching the right key, she fit it into the slot and twisted.

A soft metallic click echoed, and the first cell door creaked open.

Meanwhile, deeper within the mine, shadows clung to the walls as Vincent hovered, his gaze icy and unblinking. Rayden's voice cut through the cavern, barking commands while the last jagged chunks of ore were heaved onto the carts.

The rumor racing through the ranks: this haul had the richest yield in weeks-ore so pure that it could make a man rich overnight.

Carville's orders had been absolute-everything needed to be moved out before dawn.

Vincent melted into the shadows at the far end of the track, positioning himself precisely where every transport cart would be forced to pass.

The grade sloped sharply here, making the area treacherous. An old, battered cart lingered off to the side, its warped frame draped with a dusty tarp and stamped with Doyle's private seal.

Underneath, Vincent already knew, lay a barrel of explosives he'd discovered the night before.

The first carts rattled down the track.

Moving with practiced ease, Vincent dropped into a eside a leaky water pipe, feigning interest in the steady drip. His body blocked the view as he reached out, fingers working quickly to dislodge a small piece of the passing cart's axle.

A moment later, the sabotaged cart wobbled and veered off course, wheels squealing as it barreled straight for the cart concealing the explosives.

"Watch it!" a worker yelled out, voice cracking through the din.

An earth-shaking blast followed-a wall of fire and smoke erupted as the gunpowder went off.

In an instant, the entire mine dissolved into chaos.

Vincent acted fast, swiping the scorched strip of cloth from the debris before anyone else could notice. He strode toward Rayden, wearing a mask of bewilderment. "What's this supposed to be?"

Rayden's face flushed red with rage when he recognized Doyle's insignia. Without another word,he spun on his heel and stormed off to fetch Carville. Within moments, both men had returned, each flanked by their own crew, the tension so thick that it hummed in the air.

They immediately spotted Doyle and his men lounging in the shadows, wide grins plastered across their faces as they watched the ruined carts smolder.

Carville's hand shot up, gun leveled straight at Doyle."You really think I'm just going to let you walk away after torching my entire shipment?"

Doyle let out a cold, humorless laugh. He'd already heard whispers-Carville planned to push him aside and cut a backroom deal. Seeing that mountain of goods lined up earlier tonight? That had been proof enough. Now the whole lot was reduced to ashes.Seeing Carville's empire collapse in flames was pure,merciless delight.

"Seriously, Carville? Let's see you try anything. Boys -get them!" Doyle ordered.

Mayhem erupted at once. The mine transformed into a battlefield of shouting, fists, and flying debris. I the thick of it, vincent melted into the shadowa,dlutching a pouch of stolen cosmetics as he hurried to find Hanman.

Back in the underground cell, Hannah's heart leapt at the muffled boom echoing through the stone.Instinctively, she slammed her palm against the emergency button on her wristband.

With the women frantically assisting, they sprang into action, fumbling with keys and rushing to unlock the remaining cells.

When Hannah reached Delia's door, Delia's sudden shriek cut through the noise. "Look out!"
###Chapter 328 Come Work For Me


Malcolm had regained consciousness at some point -no one noticed exactly when. Before Hannah could even react, his arm snapped around her throat,tight as a steel cable.

The keys slipped from Hannah's fingers and hit the floor with a metallic clatter. A strangled sound forced its way from her lips as she fought to breathe, panic rising.

Malcolm's voice was filled with venom. "You bitch!Got brave now, did you? How dare you hit me? Tried to make a run for it?"

He panted, dragging her back by the neck, and snarled at the other women, "All of you, get your asses back in the cages! Now! Or I swear I'll strangle her right here-then fuck her in front of every last one of you! Let's see if you still think you can run!"

Shrieks filled the air. Fear tore through the underground cell like a raging storm.

Nina spotted Hannah's twisted face and acted fast.
With a desperate cry, she dove for the iron rod,gripped it tight, and swung with all her might at Malcolm."Let her go!"

Then, a sickening thud echoed as metal struck flesh.

Malcolm let out a furious roar, spinning toward Nina,his eyes wild. "You little whore-get over here!"

But Hannah took advantage of the instant his grip loosened. She gathered her remaining strength,jerked her knee upward, and slammed it hard into his groin.

"Argh!" Malcolm howled in pain and finally let go.

Elsa was the first to charge forward. "Now's our chance! Get him! Don't let him up!"

The rest of the women surged forward, screaming,kicking, and clawing-using whatever they had.

Malcolm's cries faded beneath the fury of their attack.

At last, Malcolm dropped to the floor, knocked out cold.

Delia, still behind bars, exhaled a shaky breath she'd been holding for too long.

Elsa stood above Malcolm's still form, eyes wide with surprise. "Wow, that actually felt good."

"Me too," someone murmured from the crowd.

Quiet, trembling laughter bubbled up-uncertain at first,but growing more real with every breath.

A faint smile appeared on Hannah's lips. "Hold on to this feeling. That's what it means to stand up for yourself."

She knelt, gathered up the keys, and walked straight to Delia's cell. With a click, she turned the last lock.

Delia wasted no time, rushing out to wrap her arms around the others.

Facing the group,Hannah's voice rang out. "Alright- let's get out of here."

She led the way toward the corridor that sloped upward.

Behind her, the women leaned on each other, legs still shaking, hearts racing as they followed her lead.

Light gleamed at the end of the tunnel.

After endless darkness, the harsh glare outside made them squint and shield their eyes.

Suddenly, a familiar figure sprinted toward them.

It was Vincent. He reached out, found Hannah's hand, and took it firmly. No questions, just a steady squeeze. "Let's go," he said.

Together,they walked out from the gloom.

On the factory's open lot, police sirens screamed through the night, and red and blue lights pulsed across the asphalt. Uniformed officers were already clearing the area.

Jason spotted Hannah and Vincent emerging safely from the building. For a moment, relief softened his hard features. Then, he stepped forward and returned their phones to them, his voice earnest."You both have guts. Real guts."

Vincent and Hannah exchanged a look.

Hannah stepped up and quietly let Jason know where Marion's body was hidden in the underground cell. Jason nodded, promising,"We'll take care of it."

Nearby, the women huddled together, gazing at the swirling lights and the steady stream of officers. It finally hit them-they were safe at last.

Some women covered their faces and sobbed, the realization almost too much to bear.

Vincent pulled a seaed pouch from his pocket and pressed it into Hannah's hand. "Here's the proof.I made sure to get it."

Hannah closed her fingers around it. "Thanks."

Off to the side, Delia watched them and whispered in awe, "You two really do make a great pair." Hannah's eyes widened. She rushed to explain,"Actually, we're not-"

Vincent stepped in without missing a beat, histone quiet and sure as he changed the topic. "What's going to happen to these women now?"

The question snapped Hannah's attention back to the group of women. She turned toward them, her voice soft. "Would you like to go home?"

Delia glanced around, eyes lost and unsure. "Home?Funny, isn't it? We're free now, but I don't even know where I belong."

Silence settled over the others. Fear had faded,replaced by a heavy uncertainty none of them could shake.

Hannah asked, "Would you like to work?"

Delia nodded right away. "I'd love to. But who would ever hire someone like me?"

"You don't have to worry about that," Hannah replied,her tone firm. "I'll hire you myself." The women fell quiet in shock.

"I mean it. Come work for me," Hannah said. "I'll take care of housing and jobs."

Elsa squinted, puzzled. "You own a business?"

Hannah answered with an easy calm, "I actually have two."

Vincent turned, watching her closely.

"Wait, seriously?" Elsa's voice rose in disbelief.

The other women now looked at Hannah with a spark of hope.

"Absolutely," Hannah replied, holding each woman's gaze. "From here on out, things are only going to get better." She reached for her phone. "Let me call someone to come get us."

Vincent stopped her, giving a light clap.

The sharp sound echoed, and a row of sleek black SUVs glided into the lot, pulling up in perfect order.Bodyguards in matching suits stepped out, nodding to Vincent as they took their positions.

Hannah blinked at the sight and then turned to Vincent, wide-eyed. "When did youset all this up?"
###Chapter 329 Case Closed Two Days Ago
Vincent's lips curved faintly. "From the very beginning," he said quietly. "I told you-l had people in place."

His tone was calm, steady. "They've been here the whole time."

Back when Hannah had been trapped in that underground cage, Vincent had almost lost control.He'd been ready to send his men in, to tear the factory apart. But he had hesitated since he knew that would have terrified her. He refused to make the same mistake twice. Therefore, he'd forced himself to hold back and stay collected. Now, she was safe.Unharmed. And, more than that, she actually looked happy. It was the best outcome he could have hoped for.

Hannah stared at Vincent, caught off guard. Vincent's brow tightened as the silence stretched.Was she about to reject him? After everything, after fighting their way out of hell together, he didn't want her to put distance between them. At least not now. If she shut him out again, he wasn't sure how he'd handle it.

A sudden warmth rose in Hannah's chest. She didn't press for more. Instead, she turned to the women behind her, lifted her hand, and called out with bright energy, "Let's go, ladies. Time to get in the cars!"

The tension in Vincent's shoulders eased. Seeing her smile tugged one from him, small but genuine.He followed,lighter in mood than he'd been in days.

One of Vincent's bodyguards leaned toward another."Did l imagine that? I swear I saw Mr. Jones smile."

"You definitely imagined it," the other replied without hesitation. "He doesn't smile. Ever."

As the group of women approached, the bodyguards stepped forward, opening the car doors with respect. The women climbed into the warm, waiting vehicles.

Engines rumbled to life, and the convoy pulled out into the night.



After arranging housing for the women, Hannah finally returned home. Only then did the tension coiled in her body begin to loosen.

Margaret's heart clenched at the sight of her daughter's pale, weary face. She bustled into the kitchen, calling, "This trip must've drained you.I'll warm up some soup."

Raymond sat on the sofa, concern etched into his features. "Rough one this time?"

Hannah offered a faint smile. "A bit challenging, but it's all sorted now."

Just then, the doorbell cut through the moment,sharp and insistent.

Raymond rose to answer it. "Claude?" He was on in. Hannah just got back."

Claude strode in, his gaze locking onto Hannah instantly. His suit was slightly disheveled, dark shadows circling his eyes.

He crossed the room in swift strides, his voice tight with worry. "Hannah, where have you been these past few days? Your phone was off, no responses;I was worried sick!"

He reached for her hand. Hannah gently patted his,her touch soothing. "'I'm fine. Just had to deal with something out of town-bad signal." Her voice was soft,laced with exhaustion.

But Claude's expression remained taut, unconvinced."You and Vincent... What exactly had you been doing?" He leaned closer, his eyes piercing. "Word is a black-market factory got taken down tonight.Were you two involved?"

Hannah's heart skipped. The past few days had been a whirlwind, almost unreal. "Not much to tell," she said lightly. "We uncovered some key evidence and helped a few people in the process."

She kept her words vague, sidestepping the deeper truth.

Claude's jaw tightened, a chill settling over him.Her evasive tone, the lack of detail-it was clear she was holding back. He clenched his fists. She'd rather charge into danger with Vincent than trust him with the truth? In her heart, did he matter less?

Jealousy twisted in his chest, bitter and corrosive.

Silence blanketed the living room.

Raymond tried to shift the conversation to safer ground.

But Hannah was done. Her body ached, her mind foggy with fatigue. She pushed herself up, steadying against the table. "Claude, I'm wiped out. I need a shower and some rest."

She turned to her mother. "Mom, give Claude the soup. I just need to crash." Without glancing at Claude's hurt expression,Hannah walked to her room and closed the door.

Claude watched her go, his face darkening,emotions swirling until they settled into a deep, brooding quiet.

The next morning, Hannah felt refreshed. She passed Nina and the oter women's names to Meagan,tasking Meagan with arranging jobs. She also ensured each received a resettlement stipend.

With everything in motion, Hannah grabbed the bag of cosmetics, the critical evidence, and headed to the police station.

In the lobby, she spotted officers escorting Carville and his crew toward the detention level.

The factory and mine were officially shut down. It seemed the ordeal was finally over.

Gavin caught her eye and gave a respectful nod."Ms. Scott, good timing. Alice Dubois's case was closed two days ago. We tried to reach you, but you were already deep in your own investigation."
Hannah blinked, a flicker of confusion rising. If the case was closed, did that mean the culprit wasn't tied to Doreline Chemical Factory?
###Chapter 330 Why Had She Rushed Things
Gawin kept his voice even. "The suspect surrendered hirmself. We have solid physical evidence, and his confession v/as thorough and consistent."

"Suarrender himself?" Hannah's brow furrowed. "Who is he?Why did he do it?"

"Troy Maddcx," Gavin replied. "He's unemployed,with a history of theft and causing troublein publie:He said he tampered vnth the cosmetics because ha PESEried the nich and held a general grudge againgt soGMy-8/picāl āntisocial thinking.

He CMErEd用 smal qlímmer qf hope: “And by the wāyi hs, Dubcis is no longer in eritical condition. Sha'Srecovering now."

Still, Hannah's unease only deepened. Resentment of the wealthy? Antisocial personality? That was the explanation? "What kind of proof did he turn in?" she asked further.

Gavin answered, "He handed over a bag filled with cosmetics. Forensics found it was loaded with Red Thorn toxin."

Without waiting,Hannah produced the pouch she'd brought from the factory and handed it over. "Officer Mercer, could you have this checked? I took it from Doreline Chemical Factory."

He eyed her for a moment but accepted the sample."Alright. I'll get tech to analyze it right away."

Thirty minutes later, Gavin was back, carrying two lab reports and looking a bit surprised. "Ms. Scott, your sample contains the exact same illegal chemicals as the evidence from Troy. Same formula, same strength. That's strong proof he was working with Doreline Chemical Factory." "The exact same..." Hannah echoed quietly, anxiety building inside her. "Officer Mercer, did Troy give any more details? About why he targeted me,and why he manipulated Daphne?"

Gavin stopped to recall the report. "His confession was pretty vague. He went on about his hatred for society and his anger toward successful people like you. He said he met Daphne at some drifter meetup,thought she was vain and easy to manipulate, so he drew her in and told her what to say. Fits the typical antisocial pattern."

Hannah frowned."And the fire at my shop? Was Troy behind that too?"

Gavin shook his head. "No connection. That fire was ruled accidental-caused by aging wiring."

Hannah grew quiet, lost in her thoughts. "Is it really just that straightforward?" she murmured, not expecting a reply.
 Meanwhile, at the Jones estate, Vincent was finally back.The moment Erica heard he had returned, she left Logan behind and rushed straight to the estate.

She hadn't even stepped through the door when her phone buzzed. Ronald Quinn, one of her subordinates, was calling. "What is it now?" she snapped, annoyance clear in her tone.

Ronald's words came out shaky. "The Doreline Chemical Factory and the mine... They've been raided. Hannah and Vincent pretended to be a married couple, went undercover, and exposed everything. Every person we had working there-gone."

"Excuse me?" Erica nearly screamed. "How did they even find that place?"

Ronald's voice grew smaller. "They traced it from Alice Dubois's allergic reaction. It led them right to the factory."

In disbelief, Erica quickly checked the news on her phone. The proof was right there-video clips showed Carville, Doyle, and the rest of her team being marched out in cuffs and pushed into police vans. The mines shut down. The factory was seized by the authorities. Her biggest money-maker-wiped out.

A storm of anger and regret crashed through her.Why had she acted so rashly? Fear of Daphne talking had made her panic. She had forced Troy to confess.

Now, remorse consumed her whole. If Troy had still been inside the factory, he would have recognized Hannah and Vincent right away. None of this would have happened. There was even a chance Hannah wouldn't have made it out alive. Mistake after mistake had led her here.

Clutching her phone, Erica's eyes burned with hatred.

Over the next few days, the smear campaign against Hannah faded away. Both Nova Tech and Polaris Tech kept gaining momentum.

At Nova Tech's sixth anniversary event, Hannah took the stage with a huge announcement. "As of today,Nova Tech and Polaris Tech will begin a complete merger. The new company will be called Luminara Group."

Thunderous applause filled the room.

Hannah had reached the decision with both Miles and Felix.

Right as excitement spread through the crowd, an angry voice suddenly cut through the noise. "What on earth do you think you're doing?"
###Chapter 331 He Was Everywhere


Delia had been assigned to serve drinks at the celebration. Her attention kept drifting toward Hannah, so she accidentally brushed against someone-a guest named Shane Wexler, a junior manager from one of Luminara Group's partner companies. Shane had a reputation for being arrogant and treated anyone he looked down on wvith contempt.

Delia's face flushed as she hurried to apologize.
But Shane wasn't having it. He jabbed a finger at her and exclaimed, "This jacket is custom-made! Do you even have the money to replace something like this?"

His outburst turned heads, drawing everyone's gaze.

Elsa, who stood nearby, hurried over to help. She quickly put herself in front of Delia and started bowing, her words tumbling out. "Sir, we're so sorry!If you take off your jacket, we'll clean it right away.
It'll look as good as new."

Shane's anger only deepened. When he caught a glimpse of the scar on Elsa's face, his expression twisted with disgust. He shoved her aside."Get lost!That ugly mug of yours is making me sick!"

Elsa stumbled back, nearly losing her balance. All the color drained from her cheeks.

The sight pushed Delia into panic. "Sir, I'm the one who made the mistake. Please don't blame her! Let me take care of it. I'll pay for the cleaning-whatever it costs!"

She pulled out a handkerchief and reached out,trying to help.

Shane's gaze slid lower, his eyes darkening with something ugly as Delia leaned forward. A cruel smirk formed on his lips. "Oh, you really want to make it up to me? Fine. Why don't you lick the wine off my jacket? Every last drop."

Delia stood frozen. He moved in closer, voice cold. "Well? It's just a little wine, not poison. Do it, and maybeI'll let it go."

Delia's whole body began to shake. Her lips trembled so hard that she couldn't get any words out.

Elsa bristled with fury and tried to rush at him,but one of Shane's lackeys quickly blocked her way.

Right then, Hannah broke through the crowd. A sharp slap rang out as her hand met Shane's cheek.

"Ms. Scott!" Shane stood there, hand pressed to his cheek, shocked by the sudden slap.

Hannah's words came out in a low, dangerous tone,fury held tightly in check. "Who the hell do you think you are? On my company's anniversary, you think you can walk in here and humiliate my employees?Who told you it was fine to strip them of their dignity?"

Her voice cut through the silence, sharp as glass."Lick it clean? Have you completely lost your mind?"

Shane shrank under her glare and tried to talk his way out. "Ms. Scott, you've got it wrong! I wasn't trying to cause any trouble! That waitress spilled on my jacket, and the other one with scar lunged at me,that's all. I just wanted an apology. That's reasonable, isn't it?"

"Waitress, you say?" Hannah let out a cold laugh,though nothing about her looked amused. "Where did you get the idea they were waitress?"

She swept her eyes over the crowd and then called out, "Curtis. Over here. NNow."

Curtis Blackwell, the head of HR, hurried over,already sweating bullets. "Y-yes, Ms. Scott..."

Hannah jabbed her finger toward Delia and Elsa,her words cold and clear. "I personally invited them as honored employee representatives of the Luminara Group. So tell me, who gave you the right to make them serve drinks? Do you think they're people you can push around? Or are you saying what I say doesn't carry any weight at all?"

Curtis stumbled over his words, face pale. "Ms. Scott, I swear, I didn't mean for any of this! They're new to this sort of event, so I thought I'd let them do something easy..."

"Easy?" Hannah snapped, slicing through his excuse."In your mind, that makes it fine for scum like him to humiliate my employees? You think it's acceptable for them to be ordered to lick someone's jacket clean?"

She fixed Curtis with a hard stare. "You're done here.Pack your things and leave Luminara Group right now."

She didn't stop there. "And as for you, Shane-your company is blacklisted for good. Every contract is cancelled,effective immediately."

She raised her voice so it echoed across the room."Security! Get these two out of my sight."

"Right away, Ms. Scott!" The guards moved in quickly, grabbing Shane and Curtis and hauling them out of the hall without a second thought. With a slow, steady breath, Hannah turned to Delia and Elsa. "If anything like this ever happens again,don't just stand there. Stand up for yourselves. I'll take care of the fallout."

Delia's and Elsa's eyes shimmered with grateful tears.

As the celebration continued, guests came up one after another to toast Hannah and offer their congratulations. By the end of the evening, she was noticeably flushed from all the drinkS.

Outside the banquet hall, Vincent had been waiting for quite some time. He could have gone in whenever he wanted since he was the CEO of Jones Group,after all, but he wanted tonight to belong to her,without drawing any of the attention to himself.

But when the event ended, Hannah didn't walk out alone. Claude was by her side, his arm thrown around her shoulders in a way that looked familiar,even intimate.

Vincent's face turned cold in an instant. Claudeseemed to be everywhere he looked.
###Chapter 332 Let's Just Be Friends


Claude half-carried a tipsy Hannah out of the hall,steadying her as she leaned on him, her steps unsteady and light.

Suddenly, Vincent stepped in, barring their way.

Claude instinctively tightened his hold around Hannah, offering Vincent a courteous but cold smnile."Mr. Jones? Is there something you need?"

Vincent didn't so much as glance at Claude. His attention was fixed entirely on Hannah. When he spoke, his tone was low, almost gentle."Congratulations. Luminara-it's a beautiful name."

Hannah, despite her tipsiness, recognized his voice immediately. She straightened, pulling herself slightly away from Claude. With a nod, her voice husky from the alcohol, she answered, "Thank you."

Still distant-but no hostility. Vincent's gaze held steady. "Could you come with me for a minute?"

"She couldn't." Claude cut in, his voice taut, arm drawing her in protectively, almost possessively. He turned to gaze at Hannah, softening his tone. "She's had too much to drink. She needs rest. Whatever you have to say, Mr. Jones, it can wait."

There was no room for argument.

A flash of annoyance crossed Vincent's face. HHis eyes dropped to Claude's hand clamped around Hannah's waist, and a wave of heat-part jealousy,part something darker-rose inside him. For a moment, it threatened to break free.

But in the end, Vincent restrained himself, looking at Hannah, his voice controlled, almost clipped. "I'm asking her."

The tension thickened.

Vincent braced himself for refusal.

But Hannah didn't look at Claude, nor did she  immediately turn Vincent down. She hesitated,clearly weighing something in her mind.

After a moment, she looked up and met Vincent's eyes-steady, clear."All right."

Claude stared, taken aback. "Hannah, I thought we were going home together?"

Claude couldn't believe it, especially after she'd just left the party on his arm.

She turned to Claude, a flicker of embarrassment passing through her expression-briefly.Something else had already taken hold. "Claude, go back without me. I've got something to handle first. I'll come home later."

She slipped free of his arms, gently but with finality.

Claude was left standing there, arms empty, frozen in disbelief as she walked away with Vincent-without so much as a backward glance. Jealousy rolled over him, sharp and heavy.

Vincent was flooded with an overwhelming, dizzying sense of joy-so much that for a moment, he forgot how to react. He simply stood there, watching her approach with unguarded greed, as if she might vanish if he blinked.

Hannah stopped in front of him, wine brightening her eyes and loosening her words. She raised an eyebrow, a hint of teasing in her voice. "Have a drink with me?"

She wanted a better place for a talk.

Vincent's voice came out soft, barely steady, with a faint tremor he couldn't quite mask. "Of course."

Anything, as long as it meant being alone with her.

Behind them, Claude remained rooted in place,watching helplessly as she walked away. It had to be those two days. Whatever had happened duringthat period had changed everything. Something he didn't know. That was the only plausible explanation for why Hannah's demeanor toward Vincent had shifted.The way she looked at Vincent had changed. No longer cold, but something else. From rejecting Vincent outright to this-drinks, alone, together? No.This couldn't go on!

Claude's jaw tightened, his eyes darkening. He couldn't afford to take things slow anymore.He had waited long enough. He had to move his plan forward.Now.

Meanwhile, Vincent didn't take Hannah to a bar.Instead, he drove her to a quiet, secluded club high above the city.

The view was breathtaking.Floor-to-ceiling windows framed the lights below, and soft jazz played in the background.

"It's quiet here," Vincent said, pulling out a chair for her.

Hannah nodded, settling by the window. A cool breeze brushed her cheeks, clearing some of the haze.

Vincent sat across from her. A waiter arrived silently,setting down two glasses of rum on ice. Vincent picked up his glass, but didn't drink. Instead,he slid a small, deep-blue velvet box across the table. "A little something. Congratulations."

Hannah immediately understood-it was a gift to celebrate the merger. She looked at the box, but left it untouched. Instead, she picked up her glass, giving the rum a slow swirl. "Thank you. And for what you did at Doreline Chemical Factory."

She paused, as though searching for the right words."You really helped me.A lot."

A warmth flickered in Vincent's eyes, but what she said next hit him hard. "Vincent... let's just be friends from now on."
###Chapter 333 Being Friends Feels Like The Best Place For Us Both
Hannah seemed to be weighing her words, but her tone was unmistakably clear. "Let's agree to leave the past behind us. From now on, being friends feels like the best place for us both."

She had already admitted to Vincent not long ago that she understood how he felt toward her.Pretending otherwise was impossible. And after what they went through at the factory-life and death together-she couldn't bring herself to keep avoiding him either. So, friendship was her answer. It was the decision she'd reached after days of thinking things through. This way, things stayed easy. Clean. Not so tense.

Friends? Vincent's grip on his glass tightened,knuckles turning pale. He swallowed hard, as if something was stuck in his throat. Being her friend was never what he wanted.

Hannah missed the struggle in his eyes. She simply lifted her glass and gave him a gentle smile. "To the beginning of our friendship?"

Vincent stayed completely still. His eyes never left her-sharp,searching,almost wounded.

His thoughts drifted, and the question left his lips before he could stop it. "Hannah... you loved me once. How can you just stop loving me?"

Pain and confusion flickered in his gaze.

She met his stare without blinking. Her reply was steady, even a bit distant. "Love runs out. Sometimes it disappears in a single instant-and then it's just not there anymore."

Her voice was quiet. But the words hit him like a sledgehammer. An instant? Which one? Was it the times he picked Brinley over her, over and over again? Or was it the five years she had been pegged as his kept woman while she was his rightful wife, their marriage hidden?

More memories flashed back. Was it when she fought through the darkness of depression all alone,while he never even noticed? Or maybe the truth was simpler-maybe he had never truly seen her for who she was.

A thousand invisible blades stabbed Vincent's chest,leaving him raw with a pain that felt endless.

Yet,he could not bring himself to accept it. Suddenly,he blurted out, his voice rough with jealousy and panic, "Is Claude the one you love now?"

Hannah's brow creased, clear that she wanted to avoid the topic. Explaining anything about Claude,especially to Vincent, was the last thing she wanted.Her answer was vague, almost evasive. "Maybe."

Vincent rose from his seat without warning. His shadow fell across her, and in just a few steps, he was towering over her. His hands slammed down on the arms of her chair, caging her in. He bent close, his breath warm against her skin, his eyes never wavering from hers. "I don't believe you,"he whispered, his tone fierce and burning. "I don't believe you moved on so fast. I don't believe you stopped loving me."

He was so near that she could feel the heat rolling off him. Every part of her was surrounded by his presence. He left no room for escape.

But Hannah didn't flinch. She didn't blush or tremble.Instead, she lifted her chin, meeting his eyes with a calm and unwavering stare. She replied indifferently,"You're this close to me, and look-I'm not blushing,and my heart's not racing. That's proof enough that l don't love you anymore."

Her words came out cool and matter-of-fact.

"Let's just be friends," she repeated.

Reaching into her bag, she took out the ring. "Here.Take it back."

She extended the ring to him, drawing a firm line under their story and returning everything to where it began.

Vincent's arms, still planted on either side of her chair, tightened on instinct. His muscles bunched beneath the fabric of his sleeves. He didn't reach for the ring.

He'd thought things looked promising.Gone was the icy hostility she used to show him. The way she looked at him now had softened. She acknowledged his abilities. There was even something else in her eyes-maybe gratitude.

But why? Why, now that she was finally willing to let him in again, even just as a friend, did it feel like something essential had been taken from him? Why did this quiet distance hurt more than her anger ever did?

He drew his arms back slowly, as though it drained all the energy from his body.

Hannah set the ring carefully on the table. Without another glance at him, she lifted her untouched drink. She tipped the glass back, swallowing every drop. The sting in her throat seemed to help clear her head. "That's all I wanted to say," she told him, voice steady as ever. "I'm leaving now."

Vincent's head jerked up, her words striking harder than he expected. When he finally spoke, his voice was rough, strained. "So you came with me... just for this?" All this way-just to tell him friendship was enough?

Hannah reached for her handbag and rose to her feet. Her eyes were calm and certain. "Yes. I've given it a lot ofthought, and I don't need your love. This is enough for me," she said, motioning between them.

A thick silence fell between them, heavy and complete.

A moment later, she glanced down at her phone.Claude had messaged-he was on his way to pick her up. She sent him her location. She didn't wait for Vincent's response. She simply walked past him toward the door.Vincent trailed behind,silent.

When Hannah reached the exit, she paused, her hand on the knob. She glanced over her shoulder at him. "You don't have to see me out. Claude's already coming to pick me up."

And so Vincent stood by the window, motionless,watching as Claude's car carried her away.
###Chapter 334 His Confession


With Raymond and Margaret's thirtieth anniversary drawing near, Claude paid a visit to Hannah's house,a detailed event proposal in hand. He explained every part of the celebration, laying out his plans while both Raymond and Margaret listened closely,nodding along, clearly pleased.

As the conversation wound down, Claude's voice took on a subtle note of nervousness and a hint of probing. "Dad, Mom, there's something I want to ask you both. Do you have any thoughts about the kind of person you hope Hannah ends up with?"

Margaret hesitated for a moment and then laughed it off. "Oh, please, what expectations could we possibly have? If Hannah's happy with him, that's all that matters."

But Raymond's brows drew together, his to ne turning more serious. "You can't put it that simply. It isn't aid memonias seemad to trauble him,and a shadow flickened across his face. "Think about that boy Vincerh Hanmah cared so much for him, but what did she get back? Nathing but heartache and muπi往句门心”

Vimcent's name wiped the smile from Margaret's face. She gave a gentle but firm nod. "Raymond is mght Lowe isn't the only thing-it takes character,reall kimdness, and treating our daughter the way she deseres to be treated."

A. quiet, steady breath filled Claude's chest as he fround the courage to go on. "So what do you think altyout me?

"wat"Margaret and Raymond blurted out, caught of guard. Their eyes darted to each other-they Fiairdn't seen that coming.

With a callm but unwavering gaze, Claude looked at Poiii of thuern, g've loved Hannah for years. I want to
spend my life with her-to give her the care, the safety, and the affection she deserves every single day."

Not a sound stirred in the living room.

Hoping to ease the tension, Claude's features softened, and a hint of uncertainty colored his voice."Are you displeased with me? Or do you think I'm not right for her?"

Margaret shook her head quickly and raised her hands in reassurance. "That's not it, not at all! You've always been outstanding-reliable and thoughtful.It's just that we are afraid Hannah doesn't feel that way about you."

"Ah, I see." Claude picked up immediately, his tone turning warm. "Actually, Hannah and I are already together. She asked me to keep it quiet for now because she didn't want to spring it on you all of a sudden. She was waiting for the right moment to share it."

His mouth curled into a calculatedly sheepish,
slightly apologetic smile as he waited for their reaction.

Shock flickered in both Raymond's and Margaret's eyes as they locked gazes once more. Was it really true? Could Hannah and Claude actually be a couple?

Softness filled Claude's demeanor as he begged quietly, "I'd appreciate it if you could keep this between us for now. Hannah's just not ready to tell you herself."

A silent understanding passed between Margaret and Raymond before they gave a slow, mutual nod.

Margaret promised gently, "We get it. Our lips are sealed, at least for the time being."

Pure delight broke across Claude's face when he spoke again, finally revealing his true intention."Once the anniversary celebration is over, I'm planning to propose to Hannah-right there, with all the people who matter most watching." That idea was the centerpiece of his plan. He trusted that, surrounded by loved ones, Hannah would not refuse.

Naturally, Margaret and Raymond were thrilled.

Raymond spoke up, his voice filled with approval."Honestly, we've always wished for Hannah to find happiness and settle down."

Just then, a sudden click from the front hall announced someone's arrival.

Returning from work, Hannah slipped off her shoes and stepped into the living room. Her eyes went straight to her parents' bright expressions-and then to Claude, who looked just as pleased. She blinked in surprise at the sight. "Oh, Claude, you're here?" she said, her words casual and familiar. "Why do you all look so cheerful?"

Quick to his feet, Claude crossed the room, gently reached for her hand, and guided her over to the couch so she could join him. "We were waiting on you, actually," he said, his tone gentle andaffectionate.

Holding up the proposal binder for her to see, he added with pride, "Take a look-this is the plan l made for your parents' anniversary. Your dad was just saying he really likes it. Tell me what you think."

Hannah accepted the folder and leafed through the pages. "You really put thought into this. The place you picked is perfect..."

From across the room, Margaret and Raymond shared a knowing glance. Soon after, they quietly left to give the two some space.

Over the next several days, Hannah plunged into her work, determined to pull off the merger of Nova Tech and Polaris Tech.

Meanwhile, her parents' anniversary plans moved forward bit by bit.

Raymond and Margaret, hoping to take some of the weight off Hannah's shoulders, offered to lend a hand. They asked Claude for the address of the venue,planning to handle some errands themselves.

But no one expected what happened next. On their way out, tragedy struck when Raymond and Margaret were involved in a terrible car crash.

No one could get through to Hannah-her phone only rang and went straight to voicemail.
###Chapter 335 World Collapsing


Inside the main conference chamber of Luminara Group headquarters, Hannah oversaw the company's inaugural central leadership gathering after the merger.

Her phone lit up. She assumed the call was from her parents inquiring about the arrangements for the anniversary event. She chose to return the call once the meeting concluded.

Yet, the screen glowed again. And again-each time in quicker succession. Focused on work, Hannah didn't notice.

Bang! The conference room entrance flung open.

The jarring sound fractured the concentration in the space. An abrupt stillness spread through the group.Every gaze shifted toward the doorway.

Claude appeared there, hair tousled, breathing hard as though he had raced all the way.

Hannah's brows knit in bewilderment. At this hour, he would never intrude without cause. "Claude? Why are you here?" she asked.

He staggered forward, voice raw. "Hannah-your parents. There's been a terrible incident."

"What is it?" An icy wave of dread surged through her.

Claude's features twisted in pain. "On their route to the venue... there was a collision."

Hannah sprang upward so suddenly that her chair toppled. She bolted toward the doorway without pause, Claude following swiftly.

At Dorbarrow Hospital, the indicator above the operating theatre glowed steadily.

Claude kept HHannah steady-her legs threatened to buckle.

At last, the door opened. A doctor emerged, his face somber. His eyes scanned the anxious two. "Who here is related to Raymond Scott?"

"I am! I'm his daughter!" Hannah slipped from Claude's grasp, stumbling toward the doctor.Her voice quavered under the strain of suppressed sobs."Doctor-my father...Is he..."

The doctor removed his mask. Grief shadowed his gaze as it met hers. "I regret to tell you we've exhausted every measure," he said heavily. "Mr.Scott endured catastrophic trauma. Several vital organs were irreparably damaged. He suffered uncontrollable internal bleeding and died on spot.We couldn't save him..."

Hannah's reality shattered in that breath. Her mind clung only to the vision of her father's radiant,booming laugh-how mere days ago he had been brimming with joy over the approaching anniversary.The warmth in his eyes... Gone. Now, all that was gone.She would never witness it again.

An unbearable weight crushed her chest. Her body weakened, and she crumpled. "Hannah!" Claude leapt forward, catching her just before she struck the floor.

He wrapped her in his arms as violent tremors wracked her frame, grief pouring from her in raw,jagged cries. "I'm here," he murmured, his own voice unsteady. "I'm here. I won't leave you."

Her tears seeped into his jacket as she clung to him,broken.

Claude held her tightly but lifted his gaze, urgency flickering as he addressed the doctor, "What about the other patient?"

The doctor exhaled slowly. "Mrs. Scott is still in surgery. She's been pulled from immediate danger,but..." He gave a grave shake of the head. "Severe head trauma. Multiple internal injuries... The outlook is grim."

Hannah shook uncontrollably. She grasped Claude's arm so fiercely that her nails nearly pierced his skin."How... How could this happen? How could they just crash like this?" A dangerous glint passed through Claude's expression. "Authorities reached a preliminary conclusion-it was a drunk driver. Blew through a red signal on the highway. Total fault."

Drunk driving. Just two words-yet they had dismantled her world. The fury and grief slammed into her with merciless force. All she could do was remain outside the operating room, waiting.

She stood there for the entire duration of the procedure. Not a syllable escaped her lips. She refused even a sipof water.

Claude stood wordless beside her.

After an eternity, the door opened.

Hannah stepped forward quickly. "How is my mother?"

The doctor's glance swept over them, his tone clipped."Who here has type B blood? The patient requires an immediate transfusion. The supply is critically depleted." Hannah's tears spilled. "Neither of us does."

Claude placed a hand on her shoulder. "Don't lose hope.I'll secure it."

The doctor shook his head. "There's no time.You must locate a donor instantly."

"I'm type B." A voice rang out from behind them.Vincent had appeared abruptly the far end of the hall.

Vincent had just completed a global acquisition spanning continents when his assistant delivered the news. There had been no chance to change out of his tailored suit-he'd chartered a helicopter and flown straight over. Even so,it was already far too late for some matters.

He moved forward, a fine sheen of perspiration on his brow. He approached the doctor, his tone resolute. "I'll donate."

"Very well. Follow the nurse," the doctor instructed,signaling for assistance. Vincent gave a small nod.

Hannah clutched his hand, her words trembling with gratitude. "Thank you. Thank you so much..."

Even Claude offered a brief nod in acknowledgment.

But Vincent's attention stayed on Hannah. He gave her hand a light pat, murmuring, "She's going to be okay."

Time dragged once more. Finally, the doctor emerged, but his expression was laden with sorrow."Ms. Scott," he said quietly, "I regret to inform you-"

A horrific realization struck Hannah like a bolt. Her mother gone as well?
###Chapter 336 Her Revenge


Hannah's frame shivered, and Claude's hold around her instantly grew firmer.

The doctor continued gravely, "Ms. Scott, though your mother has been stabilized, her injuries are exceptionally grave. The bleeding inside her skull has been halted, yet the harm to her brain tissue is significant. Several ribs are broken, accompanied by bruised lungs, and her abdominal organs have sustained damage... Truthfully, making it through the operation at all is extraordinary. As for the moment-or possibility-she might awaken, I cannot predict."

Hannah's gaze lifted sharply. Drops of moisture clung stubbornly to her lashes, and the flood of sorrow mixed with fragile relief robbed her of breath.Not gone? At least... At least her mother still remained.That meant hope.

Claude exhaled, the sound soft, and brushed away
the moisture along her cheeks. "We should feel grateful."

Hannah inclined her head, her voice thick with feeling. "Yes." She expressed her appreciation to the doctor and the nurses trailing behind him. "Thank you... Truly, thank you. I mean every word."

At that moment, the nurses wheeled out the portable hospital bed.

Margaret lay beneath a network of tubes, her head encased in heavy wrappings. Her complexion was drained of color, but the faint blips on the monitor proved that life still clung to her.

Hannah hurried to her mother's side and clasped her mother's chilled fingers.

The nurses guided the bed briskly down the hallway.Hannah and Claude followed without delay.

Moments after their departure, the door at the far end of the corridor, leading to the blood donation area,swung open. Vincent stepped out, his face pale. He was still tugging his rolled sleeves into place as he emerged.In that instant, his eyes caught Claude's arm still encircling Hannah, the two moving away together.

Vincent approached the chief surgeon. "Doctor," he said in a clipped tone, "I want a thorough briefing on Margaret Scott's state."

Elsewhere, within Erica's opulent residence, mellow jazz drifted languidly through the air.

Erica, draped in a deep crimson silk robe and barefoot upon a lush rug, moved in a jagged waltz at the center of the lounge with Logan.

Her rhythm was erratic and forceful-more like venting than dancing. She clung to Logan's neck, her figure pressed into his, tilting her face toward the features so uncannily like Vincent's, eyes glassy, her laugh fractured and unhinged.

From a shadowed corner, a subordinate entered without sound. "Miss Stanton. Raymond Scott-dead on the scene. Margaret Scott-sustained critical
harm, taken to intensive care. Prospects of survival are minimal. The intoxicated driver we employed has surrendered and admitted all."

Erica froze. She thrust Logan away, a sharp burst of exultant laughter escaping her. "Perfect. Absolutely perfect!"

She spun in place, intoxicated with triumph. "Hannah Scott! You tore apart my factory, wrecked my valuable mine, and crippled my trade!" Her gaze burned with hatred and perverse delight. "Now you will learn what it means to lose the ones you treasure most."

She approached the towering pane of glass and tapped twice with fingers lacquered in vivid red."Two lives... Quite a bargain for you."

With a flick of her hand, she dismissed the subordinate. Yet, before he could vanish, she remembered something and called after him, "Where is Vincent?"

The man inclined his head. "At the hospital." A dark glint flashed in Erica's eyes. She pivoted abruptly toward Logan, closing the space between them in long strides.

The subordinate departed soundlessly.

Erica's slim fingers rose, tracing the angle of Logan's jaw, her gaze hazy and fixated. "Vincent, when will there be a place for me beside you?"

Her touch drifted downward to his neck, a blend of provocation and possessive claim.

"I've waited endlessly. Why... Why can't you notice me?" Her tone spiked without warning before she surged forward, locking her arms behind his neck and crushing her lips to his.

Logan endured it passively.

Her kiss grew fierce, forcing him back into the breadth of the sofa.

She straddled him. "Why... why..." The tremor in her voice deepened as her movements turned frantic. In the dimness, their bodies intertwined-harsh breaths and stifled sounds filling the space.

No one knew how much time passed before the frenzy ebbed.

Erica lifted herself from Logan, her breathing ragged,a slow satisfaction softening her expression.

She spared Logan no glance. Without speaking, she strode toward the adjoining bathroom. Now, she would make her way to the hospital. Watching Hannah break apart-that would be the sweetest reward.
###Chapter 337 Suspected


Within the hospital room, Margaret remained completely still on her bed. In the span of a single night, Hannah's appearance had grown markedly more worn, the shadows beneath her eyes sinking deeper.

Claude had departed for the police station to address the aftermath of the car crash. Before stepping out,he had urged Hannah with sincerityto get some rest -yet how could rest even be possible?

At that moment, the entrance to the hospital chamber eased open. A nurse guided two people inside.

Sharon leaned upon a cane, with Erica providing steady support at her side.

Since Erica was visiting the hospital to see how devastated Hannah had become, she naturally brought Sharon along so as to avoid arousing suspicion.

"Oh, Hannah..." Sharon's eyes glistened red the instant she took in Hannah's state. "How could such an awful thing occur... Dear, you must hold on. Don't let sorrow consume you."

"Sharon..." Hannah struggled to rise, her voice roughened.

Erica held a bouquet of white lilies in her hands.She stepped forward and gently set the blooms atop the cabinet beside Margaret's bed. Then, she turned toward Hannah, her tone light yet laced with false sympathy. "Ms. Scott, my condolences."

Hannah regarded Erica in silence, offering only the faintest inclination of her head.

Vincent entered carrying the updated treatment plan he had just confirmed with the doctors. His gaze swept over the two women, and his brows drew together at once. "Grandma, Erica, what brings you here?"Sharon breathed out a quiet sigh. "It was Erica who told me. She said something dreadful had happened to Hannah. I couldn't simply stay home, so I came immediately. And you-how could you keep the family in the dark over something like this?"

Vincent had purposefully concealed it from his grandmother to spare her worry-her health had been especially fragile of late.

Hannah's head lifted abruptly, her eyes locking onto Erica."How did you learn what had happened to my family?" So precise. So immediate. They had shared no genuine interaction before now.

For the briefest instant, Erica's smile stiffened, but she swiftly regained composure. Her tone became airy and feignedly innocent. "Oh? I just caught it online-I always follow the news. I happened to see a report about your parents... It shocked me. I told Mom straight away. She's always cared for you, so we decided to come by."

She allowed her eyes to drift briefly toward Vincent before softening her tone. "Even though we're no longer family, you and Vincent once shared a marriage. Naturally, we'd want to check on you. ls that somehow wrong?"

That last line, spoken in a deliberately fragile tone,was her way of playing the moral card.

Vincent's jaw tightened. His tone dropped low,carrying warning. "Erica." He was telling her to stop.

Erica turned toward him with a small pout."What?|haven't said anything wrong."

Hannah gave no reply. She retrieved her phone and began rapidly scrolling through the headlines. With her head bent, she searched intently for any coverage tied to her parents' car crash.

Moments passed. One unrelated article after another loaded on the screen... Until at last-a breaking news update appeared, uploaded only two minutes earlier.It came from a small, barely known local outlet.

The title stated simply, "Severe Collision on Westridge Road Leaves One Dead, One in Critical Condition."

Erica had lied. A cold shiver ran along Hannah's spine. There was no mistaking it now-Erica was connectedd to her parents' tragedy.

Hannah lifted her gaze suddenly, her stare sharp and unyielding. "Ms. Stanton, which outlet carried the report you read? Was it Spotlight Weekly?"

She gave Erica no time to prepare, pressing Erica immediately. Spotlight Weekly was a minor tabloid specializing in celebrity gossip and sensational trivialities. She had dropped the name deliberately-to bait Erica.

A flash of unease crossed Erica's eyes, though her expression remained mostly steady. She forced a casual chuckle. "Oh? Yes, maybe.I glanced at it early this morning. Didn't pay attention to the outlet's name."

A cold curve formed at the edge of Hannah's lips."Interesting. Spotlight Weekly never published anything about the crash." She turned her phone so Sharon and Vincent could see. "The earliest report online is from this outlet-posted exactly a few minutes ago." Her voice was like ice. "Ms. Stanton, why did you fabricate that?"

Both Sharon and Vincent turned their attention toward Erica.

Vincent's brow furrowed further, and his voice took on a hardened edge. "Were you involved in the collision?"
###Chapter 338 | Don't Like These Flowers
The brightness once lighting up Erica's expression dimmed entirely. Rather than replying to Vincent's question right away, she drew in a sharp breath, her chest heaving violently. Moisture welled up in her gaze instantly, and as if on cue, streams of tears slipped free-her flair for theatrics was truly unmatched.

Her tone turned cutting without warning. "This is beyond cruel! What you're saying is outrageous! I came here with good intentions to visit! Yes, I misremembered the news-that's on me, and I regret it! But that doesn't mean you can throw such an unfounded murder charge at me!"

Turning toward Sharon, cheeks drenched, Erica clutched Sharon's wrist. "Mom! Just look at them!What kind of person do they think I am? | was brought up under the Jones name. I'm adopted, yes,but I know morals! How could I possibly do something that vile?"

Sharon's resolve melted in a heartbeat. Watching Erica sob so "wretchedly," she reflexively stepped ahead to protect her and urged, "Vincent! Hannah!Please, take a breath! How can you throw out such weighty statements without a shred of truth? Erica might be headstrong, but she's incapable of such evil."

Hannah, however, had long harbored her suspicion.She didn't buy a single word from Erica's mouth.

Hannah's eyes landed icily on the bright bundle of white chrysanthemums by the bed. She advanced,seized the bouquet with hands quaking, lifted it high,and brought it crashing down in front of Erica in a storm of suppressed rage.

Thud! Petals flew and scattered across Erica's stunned expression.

The move caught Erica off guard, her mask cracking under a surge of naked irritation. "Hannah, have you lost your mind?"she screamed.

Hannah's eyes pierced, her voice laced with revulsion. "Lost my mind? I'm merely kicking you out.I don't like these flowers. And so does your presence."

Hannah's stare burned like frost.

Erica's features warped with visible indignation.The fury boiling beneath her skin exploded as she snapped, "You don't like them? Why should that matter? You'll still have to use them anyway. When your father was buried, wasn't he all covered in these flowers? Who's to say your mother won't get them next?"

Erica's rage turned her feral.

Crack! Hannah surged forward and slapped Erica hard across the cheek.

Erica, livid, flung her hand up in retaliation, but Hannah parried the motion. "Don't provoke me in front of my mother!" Hannah hissed.

Hannah shoved Erica away, sending her stumbling back.

Sharon shook with rage, her skin ghost-pale. "Erica,how could you say that?" She couldn't believe what she'd heard. Was this truly the polished, respectful Erica she knew?

Erica's lips pressed together. "My words might have been blunt, but I wasn't wrong."

Erica made no effort to exit, and all patience drained from Vincent's gaze.

Without giving Erica a chance to react, Vincent grabbed her wrist with his right hand, his hold harsh and unforgiving. He yanked her away from Sharon's side and hurled her toward the room's threshold.

Erica stumbled backward, only steadying herself by clutching the frame. She had been cast out by Vincent. The lingering warmth of his grip remained on her wrist.

Erica took a deep breath, inhaling Vincent's scent.She smirked. It appeared Hannah was sharper than she seemed.

Stillness wrapped the hospital room in an instant.

Sharon stepped. forward, sorrow soaking her words as she addressed Hannah, "Hannah, please forgive Erica. I offer my deepest apology on her behalf.She spoke rashly-she didn't mean it. I failed in guiding her properly, and I'm sorry this happened."

Every syllable carried weighty regret.

Hannah's insides swirled with a tumult of emotions.She tried to reply, but her throat seized; silence swallowed her voice. Crushed under mourning and residual fury, her knees buckled slightly.

Vincent quickly steadied Hannah with a firm grip on her arm. He glanced at Sharon, his voice low but steady with assurance. "Grandma, please have a seat." Just then, the heart monitor let out a faint, almost undetectable shift in rhythm.

Hannah and Vincent caught it at once. Their heads snapped toward the bed.

Lying still as ever was Margaret-yet her eyelids twitched faintly. Then, her eyelids flickered again.

Under the breathless stares around her, Margaret,pushing herself with great strain, managed to pry her eyes open. Her lips parted slightly, trying to form words, but only a whisper came out, barely audible."Anna...Anna..."

The whisper sliced through the hush like a scream.

"Mom!" Hannah bolted to the bed, clasping Margaret's hand as tears poured freely down her cheeks.

Vincent observed the moment, the hard lines of his face softening. Quietly, he took a step back, giving the mother and daughter their moment.

Sharon rose to her feet, tears glimmering in her eyes. Using what little strength she had left, Margaret finally voiced a full sentence, "Where is Claude? |have something to tell you both."
###Chapter 339 | Am Willing To Marry You
Hannah forced down her rising emotions and hurriedly pacified Margaret, "Alright, alright, Mom,don't worry. I'll bring Claude here right away!"

Hannah pulled out her mobile phone and, her fingers quivering, drafted a message to Claude, telling him about Margaret's awakening and urging him to reach the hospital immediately.

Once the message was sent, Hannah exhaled slowly.Her eyes fell on her mother, whose gaze revealed a lingering frailty, and once more, that crushing sorrow swelled violently inside her. "Mom..." Her tone faltered, thick with torment. "Dad, he..."

Hannah had no idea how to begin revealing to her mother that merciless reality-that Raymond had passed away. But to her astonishment, Margaret's look was composed, carrying within it a stark resignation that seemed to transcend mortality. With a weary nod,every tiny motion appearing to drain what strength remained, she murmured, "I know. When the crash happened, he... he shielded me. Before the ambulance arrived, his heart had already ceased.I...l heard it."

Hannah felt as if her chest had been smashed by an enormous hammer! So her mother had been aware through everything; she had endured it all, lying there conscious as Raymond's breath faded away.

"It's alright, Mom! We still have each other! I will look after you! We will endure this..." Hannah stuttered through the words, struggling to console her mother and, at the same time, to calm her own spirit. "It's just us now... Mom..."

Margaret's body trembled faintly against her daughter's arms. She gave no reply to her daughter's sobs and words of comfort, only staring emptily upward at the ceiling. Sharon, taking in this devastating moment, wiped at her tears again. Fighting back her sorrow, she gently tugged Vincent's sleeve and whispered, "Let's leave... We shouldn't remain here and disturb them...Let them have some time alone..."

Vincent's eyes reflected a tangled storm of emotions. He understood Sharon's intent. At such a moment, the presence of anyone else felt unnecessary. He inclined his head slightly, his tone hushed."Alright."

Then, steadying Sharon, he silently withdrew from the hospital room and gently pulled the door closed behind them.

Vincent guided Sharon into her vehicle. Still concerned, he returned toward Margaret's ward. He didn't go inside, though, since Claude had already arrived.

Leaning against the chilly wall, Vincent silently listened to the words spoken inside.

Within the hospital ward, Claude hurried to the bedside, his face showing the perfect balance of relief and grief. The look he directed toward Margaret radiated measured concern. "Mom! You're awake,thank heavens!"

"Claude... Anna..." Margaret gripped Claude's hand.Her breathing grew somewhat heavier, as if an urgent confession pressed on her. "Raymond had one final wish before death claimed him."

Both Hannah and Claude froze.

Margaret spoke with deliberate clarity, each word measured. "He regretted deeply... not being able to see the two of you get married."

Hannah was stunned. "Dad wished for me and Claude to marry?"

A flicker of elation burst in Claude's eyes, though instantly veiled by a flawless mask of shock and mourning. He gazed at Margaret with an expression of "utter disbelief," his eyes brimming, his tone thick."Mom..." Margaret gave Hannah no chance to react or protest.Her intense stare locked on Hannah and then shifted to Claude. "This is my wish as well."

Her eyes reflected endless despair and an unyielding resolve. "Claude, move the wedding forward. Hold the ceremony and then conduct the funeral. Regard it as honoring Raymond's wish."

An oppressive silence blanketed the room. The only sound was Margaret's uneven, labored breathing.

Hannah couldn't process it. Why would her father suddenly want her to marry Claude?

Claude crouched down beside Margaret's hospital bed. "Mom, don't worry. Anna and I will manage it."

Margaret's gaze lifted once more toward the ceiling."As soon as possible."

Margaret resolved that once she witnessed Hannah secured in marriage, she would join her deceased husband without any concerns, knowing Claude would take good care of Hannah.
Outside the doorway, Vincent clenched his fists until his knuckles cracked sharply like breaking twigs. A suffocating panic surged violently in his chest.Hannah marrying Claude? He would never permit such a thing.

Having said her piece, Margaret drifted into slumber.

In the corridor, Hannah rubbed her temples wearily.

"Anna, what do you think?" Claude faced her,probing cautiously.

Hannah raised her head, her expression entirely lost."It's all too sudden." She couldn't picture rushing into marriage while still drowning in such fresh grief.

Claude's spirit sank, yet his features instantly displayed sympathy, understanding, and profound devotion. "I understand. I know how you feel. Truly,it is too sudden."

He advanced one step nearer, narrowing the gap, his voice softening to an intimate murmur. "But Anna, I am willing to marry you. And you? Are you willing to marry me?"
###Chapter 340 Marry Me


Hannah's chest swirled with turmoil. To carry out her father's "dying wish," she felt she had no grounds to reject. Besides, with one broken marriage behind her,she had already abandoned any faith or anticipation for wedded life. Thus, marrying Claude to honor that "dying wish" wasn't such a big deal for her. No torment could equal the grief of losing a cherished parent.

"For my parents' sake, of course, I am willing to marry you," Hannah said to Claude, her expression calm and composed.

Upon her consent, Claude was seized by overwhelming elation.

"But Claude," she added, her tone edged with unease, "this is unjust to you. This is surrendering your joy."

"It is not!" he retorted without hesitation. He flung his arms outward and crushed her against his chest."Anna, how could becoming your husband ever be deemed a loss?"

He had yearned for this day through endless years of waiting.

Hannah was clasped so tightly that she could hardly breathe, and she disregarded the hidden weight resting in his words.

Claude, overcome by rapture, eased his hold slightly but kept his hands fixed upon her shoulders. His gaze flared with fervent light, alive with restless urgency. "Anna, let's decide the wedding for three days from now, shall we?"

He spoke in a rush, terrified she might waver. "Let's carry out their wish swiftly, so your father can rest in peace and your mother can devote herself to recovery." He dressed his plea in the noblest of reasons.

Hannah's eyes tightened. It felt too sudden. "Isn't that too hasty? There's hardly enough time to

prepare..."

"No worries!" Claude cut her off with confidence,his face brimming with determination. "Trust me. Leave everything in my hands. I will arrange every last detail and guarantee perfection!"

He cupped her face, his gaze softened. "You need only rest and focus on becoming my wife."

A wave of dizziness coursed through Hannah, and she unconsciously found herself nodding, submitting to this predetermined "arrangement."

Suddenly, a voice echoed from the far end of the hall."| disagree."

It was Vincent, his tone laden with commanding weight.

Both Hannah and Claude jolted at the sound, jerking their heads toward him.

Claude shifted to shield Hannah behind his frame.Dismissing Vincent's remark, Claude smiled and extended an invitation. "Mr. Jones, since you
overheard, you are welcome to attend our wedding."

Vincent disregarded Claude's barb. His stare fastened firmly upon Hannah's face. "Hannah, are you really going to marry him?"

Hannah moved out from behind Claude's shielding stance. She lifted her chin, met Vincent's conflicted eyes, and declared a single word, "Yes."

It was plain and unambiguous.

Vincent strode forward with force. The air thickened around him, his voice weighed down with unrelenting command. "Merely for your parents? For that supposed final wish?"

Hannah's eyes trembled faintly, yet her words stayed unwavering,filled with finality. "Yes. My parents, right now, outweigh everything else. Their wishes are my priority."

Vincent's tone cracked with smothered fury; the edge of his composure threatened collapse. "So you should sac rifice yourself? Sacrifice your own happiness and marriage?"

"Sacrifice? Vincent, you're mistaken. Claude is nothing like you." Hannah seemed to recall something, her lips bending in bitter self-ridicule."Marrying him isn't a sacrifice. Perhaps we might even grow old together."

Vincent's heart wrenched. She declared-Claude was not like him.

Claude, inflamed by her validating words, surged with victorious rapture. He suddenly sensed the instant was flawless, a chance never to return. What moment could serve better for a proposal than this-directly before Vincent?

Abruptly, Claude stepped back half a pace. Under Hannah's startled look and Vincent's narrowing gaze,he dropped onto one knee. He drew out a small velvet case he'd prepared long before and lifted its lid. "Anna! Marry me!" His voice shook with excitement.

Hannah froze."You...When did you prepare this? Claude's answer came sharp and unwavering. "Ages ago!"

He had prepared it centuries ago, intending to propose on her parents' wedding anniversary. He had awaited this moment for countless days.

Claude glanced about the stark hospital corridor and spoke quickly. "Anna, this place is too plain for a proposal. Later, I swear | will give you the most splendid, most romantic proposal ever!"

Hannah stretched her hand forward. Without a pause, she took the ring and slid it onto the ring finger of her left hand. "This suffices," she said,her tone level and stripped of all feeling.

Claude bounded upright, clinging to Hannah's ring-clad hand. As if staking his claim, he pressed a fierce kiss against her hand and vowed, "Anna, I will cherish you! I will devote my life to bringing you joy!"

A faint, nearly invisible curve touched her lips as she inclined her head."Okay." Vincent stood watching. The sight carved through his heart, searing every nerve within him. She had accepted Claude's ring right before his eyes. His footing almost faltered.

As Claude, pulling Hannah along, moved to pass by him, Vincent suddenly reached out and seized her other hand.
###Chapter 341 Wedding Day


Vincent exerted the last remnants of his strength, his throat rasping from the sheer strain of holding himself together. "I have already secured the best treatment for your mother. The foremost specialists in cranial injuries, directed by Dr. Ross Spencer, will arrive tomorrow for a full evaluation."

Pausing to let his words sink in, he added, "As for your father's burial-every ritual, every single procedure, every detail of the arrangement, I will personally oversee it all to the highest standard possible. I will uncover the crucial proof tying Erica to this crash. In three days, I will force the real culprit to kneel before your father's grave and your mother's bed and beg for forgiveness!"

Vincent laid out a series of promises. The medical care, the burial, and the truth. Each one represented the urgent needs Hannah could not set aside in that moment. He was prepared to remove every barrier on her behalf. He spoke these promises as though bargaining for her acceptance.

Vincent gazed at Hannah with unbearable depth,every ounce of pride and control crumbling into one last raw, undignified plea. "Could you refuse to marry Claude?"

At these words, Claude's eyes blazed with uncontrollable rage.

Hannah,whose wrist was trapped tightly in Vincent's grip, uttered nothing.

Time seemed to crawl endlessly.

Moments later, Hannah slowly withdrew her wrist from Vincent's grasp, inch by inch, her determination unwavering. Then, she raised her eyes to meet Vincent's gaze. "I couldn't."

Having said that, she didn't spare him another look.She turned to Claude, her tone flat and emotionless."Claude, let's get out of here."

Claude immediately tightened his grip on Hannah's hand and led her away.

Vincent was left alone, frozen in place. He remained in that futile posture of clinging to what had already slipped away. His palm closed on nothing but the vanishing trace of her warmth.



The following three days surged by in restless commotion. Claude managed every detail of the wedding,leaving Hannah time to sort out her own issue.

Hannah, suspicious of Erica, had promptly had someone look into Erica.

Yet, the report returned maddeningly useless. Erica's years abroad were a void; her career record was practically blank. It was evident she was not merely Sharon's adopted daughter. Her background proved far more intricate than Hannah had assumed.

Time slipped quickly, and the wedding day came.

At Hannah's insistence, the ceremony was designed to be small and tender, with only close friends in attendance.

Margaret, granted a rare two-hour release from the hospital for her daughter's wedding, sat in a wheelchair.Her complexion was pale, but her spirit glowed, and a nurse attended to her at her side.

Hannah, from her suite, kept checking her mother's condition with anxious glances.

In the hall, Claude welcomed guests warmly; indeed,every aspect was perfectly managed, just as he had pledged. Hannah didn't have to fret over anything.

Asking everyone to leave her briefly, Hannah picked up a picture of Raymond. Instantly, tears gathered in her eyes. She was getting married today. She wished Raymond could witness it.

Lost in her emotions, Hannah failed to notice the figure who had entered the room and approached her.

In a flash, Vincent's unmistakable scent surrounded her. The next second, before she could react, his arms clamped tightly around her waist from behind.

Hannah knew immediately it was Vincent. Knowing resistance was useless, she kept her voice controlled. "Vincent, the guests should wait in the main hall, not here."

Instead of releasing her, his hold grew fiercer, his breath burning against her ear as he whispered a command, "This is your final chance. Do not marry Claude."

Hannah behaved as if she hadn't heard him. She tried to peel his hands away, her face calm and steady. "Release me. The ceremony is about to begin."

With sudden strength, Vincent spun her around within his embrace, forcing her to face him. His fingers pressed into her shoulders with crushing force, his bloodshot eyes blazing. "Do not marry him.Leave with me!"

The instant Vincent received Claude's wedding invitation, seeing her name, "Hannah Scott," printed beside Claude's as the bride, an unbearable agony had shattered his famed control. He couldn't stand by and watch her walk down the aisle to become another man's wife. He simply could not. And so he came to seize her away.

Hannah's voice was unnervingly calm. "Vincent,could you knock it off? Today is one of the most meaningful days of my life. Out there are my mother,my family, my friends, and the man I am about to wed. How could I abandon all of that to leave with you-especially you, whose history with me is a broken marriage?"

She knew her parents would never have wanted such a spectacle. To her, this marriage was solely about fulfilling their wish. In a few days, at her father's funeral, she and Claude would bury him together as husband and wife. That way, her father could rest in peace, and her mother could focus on recovering without any concerns. After everything that had happened, this was her simple desire. Her tone shifted into formal detachment. "If you are truly here to give blessings, you are welcome to stay and share a toast."

Yet, in the next heartbeat, her voice cut like steel,filled with the authority of Luminara Group's leader."But if you intend to create disorder, I must demand that you leave at once. I will not permit anyone to destroy my wedding."

Her words were final, piercing Vincent's heart like a blade. Rage surged unmistakably in his eyes. His lips curved into a faint, sinister smile. This wedding would never take place.
###Chapter 342 Taking You


The solemn announcement of the wedding officiant suddenly echoed from beyond the door. "Honored attendees! Please extend your heartfelt applause to greet today's radiant bride, Ms. Hannah Scott, as she arrives for her sacred union! The wedding ceremony commences this very moment!"

In the moment Vincent was distracted, Hannah tore herself free from his grasp. She swiftly adjusted the shoulder veil and headpiece that his grasp had disturbed. Without offering another glance at Vincent, she pivoted and strode directly toward the door.

The door began to part with a slow creak.

Hannah slightly turned her head, her tone steady as thoughshe were uttering a final farewell. "Vincent,just bless me.Perhaps we may remain friends, I appreciate everything you've done during this period."

She wouldn't deny that Vincent had arranged the specialist for her mother's medical review, and he had tirelessly assisted her since the accident involving her parents. She also felt indebted for all his efforts concerning the Doreline Chemical Factory case. Their journeys would most likely never intersect again after today;each would begin separate lives.

Taking a deep breath, Hannah stepped forward.

An icy shiver of dread pierced through Vincent, chilling him to the core. He observed as the door swung open fully, and Hannah, lifting her gown, advanced toward another man. No! This was utterly intolerable.She could not marry Claude! Even if it meant she would despise him forever, he had to do this.

The solemn notes of the wedding processional filled the air. All the guests stood in respectful attention.

Hannah inhaled deeply and, gripping the heavy folds of her gown, stepped once, then again, toward Claude.
Just as she reached the midpoint of the aisle, with only a handful of steps remaining between herself and Claude, Vincent's silhouette abruptly appeared from behind her. A collective, stunned gasp surged across
the assembly.
With a single determined stride, Vincent crossed the space and positioned himself firmly before Hannah.

Before Hannah could comprehend the situation, let alone respond, Vincent's hand darted forward and clamped around her wrist with relentless, unyielding strength. The pressure was so fierce that it seared her skin like fire.

"Vincent Jones! What is the meaning of this?" Claude's enraged shout thundered through the chapel.

But Vincent didnot spare Claude even a glance from his peripheral vision. His eyes were fixed unwaveringly on Hannah's features as he declared with clarity,"I'm taking you away."

"Vincent, release me!" Hannah finally snapped back into awareness and began thrashing desperately."If you don't want me to hate your gut for the rest of my life, let go of me right now!" Her voice was cutting and quivered with emotion.

"I won't let you go." Vincent's reply was low, devoid of any emotion. The sinews in his arm bulged with force,easily subduing her frantic resistance.

Claude's eyes widened in fury. He lunged toward Vincent with a savage roar, "Scoundrel! Release her!"

Yet,as Cclaude was on the verge of reaching them, several shadowed figures in black suddenly stepped forth from hidden corners throughout the church.

Assembling into an unbreakable barrier, they swiftly intercepted and encircled Claude. Two of them jerked Claude's arms behind his back, restraining him with brutal efficiency.

Vincent's men likewise blocked the security staff and guests who attempted to intervene.

Claude's eyes blazed with venomous hatred; it was unmistakably evident that this had been orchestrated.

The church immediately plunged into uproar.

Hannah stared in shock as Claude was subdued so easily and as the black-garbed men materialized without warning. "Vincent, have you lost all sense?"

Vincent replied flatly, "Taking you is not lunacy." This was the deliberate outcome of his prolonged deliberation. He disregarded the uproar and the screams surrounding them.
"Vincent! You monster! Free my daughter! You will pay for this!" Margaret cried with every fragment of strength, the overwhelming strain making her weakened body tremble violently.

"Let...Anna...go..."Margaret's voice faltered thinner and thinner before her frame collapsed uncontrollably.

"Mom!" Hannah screamed in terror as her mother reeled, her gaze rolling back before she toppled straight to the floor.

Hannah's chest convulsed with panic. A raw, desperate shriek tore from her throat, fractured with fear."Vincent, my mom! Something has happened to my mom! Let go of me! I must get to my mom! I have to check on my mom!"

Hannah writhed frantically against Vincent, sobbing, shrieking, and striking his arm with wild force. Tears of sheer panic streamed down her face-her mother was her only remaining immediate family.

Yet,Vincent's expression remained utterly unmoved.

As others shouted and rushed toward Margaret, Vincent bent low. His other arm slid beneath Hannah's knees and, disregarding her cries and protests, he heaved the bridal-clad Hannah forcibly onto his shoulder.

Hannah battered his back with furious fists, even driving her teeth deep into the flesh of his shoulder and neck.

A stabbing pain raced through Vincent, but he only narrowed his brow faintly, never halting his pace.

Amid the chaos overwhelming the wedding hall, Vincent strode out, Hannah in tow. He intended to lock her away where no one could ever reach her. And then, he would meticulously unfold his plan.
###Chapter 343 Claiming You


Vincent brought Hannah to a place she didn't recognize, its heavy security making it feel more like a fortress than a refuge.

Inside, she was settled into a grand, sprawling room that gleamed with luxury, though it offered her no comfort. Her cheeks were still streaked with tears, her chest tight with one desperate thought-what had become of her mother?

"Vincent!" Hannah clutched his wrist with trembling fingers, her voice ragged, weighted with panic.′′My mom collapsed back there! Please, let me go to her-I have to know if she's alright!"

Vincent turned around with deliberate calm, his gaze an abyss no one could cross. His voice held no warmth, no flicker of emotion, as he declared firmly, "From this moment on, this is where you belong.You will not go anywhere else."

"Let me go right now!" Her voice cracked despite her desperate attempt at composure, every word trembling with fear and pleading. "Please, just let me check on my mother. If you let me see her, I'll act as if none of this ever happened today."

"Act as if it never happened?" Vincent's gaze sharpened, a faint flicker of something unreadable flashing in his eyes. "Not a chance!"

He had dragged her away before witnesses; to him, that meant she belonged to him now.

Hannah's face drained of color. She stumbled back a step, her eyes burning with crushed hope and raw disappointment.

Vincent looked away, his expression unreadable as he strode toward the door. His voice, low and unyielding,carried a final command. "From now on, your movements are restricted to this room."

A hollow laugh escaped her lips, brittle and laced with scorn. Her eyes glittered with bitter mockery.11SO you're locking me up again, Vincent? The last time, when I couldn't even see, you had imprisoned me under
the excuse of protecting me. And now?"

She stepped forward, her words like sharp glass. "What's the noble justification this time? Because I'm getting married? Because I finally found a way to slip out from under your control?"

Vincent lingered at the threshold only for a heartbeat before pushing forward. He didn't turn back or bother with an explanation. The door shut behind him with a heavy finality.

Outside, the butler waited in perfect silence, posture straight and hands folded.

Vincent's command came curt and cold. "Keep an eye on her. Deliver meals three times a day on time. Post two guards at her door. She couldn't take a single step out."

"Got it, Mr. Jones," the butler replied with a deep bowN, his tone steeped in deference.

Vincent strode off without another word.

Later that day, when Vincent finally wrapped up his company affairs, dusk had already bled into night. He came back to the estate, jacket hanging from one arm, the precise cut of his shirt underscoring his simmering unease.

"How is she?" He halted at the threshold, his tall frame casting a shadow onto the door, though he didn't open the door and step inside. His tone was flat, stripped of warmth or worry.

The butler bowed slightly, hands clasped at his sides, and spoke in a muted voice. "Mr. Jones, Ms. Scott..."

Vincent's brows drew together, a flicker of disapproval flashing across his face. "Call her Mrs. Jones."

"Yes, Mr. Jones," the butler corrected instantly. "From the instant you departed until now, Mrs. Jones has refused every meal and drink brought to her. She hasn't spoken a single word either."

The air instantly grew thick and still.

Vincent's presence thickened the air, oppressive and dark. He didn't glance at the butler, his gaze locked instead on the steel door, his eyes as cold and unyielding as the metal itself.

After a long stretch of silence, he yanked the suffocating tie from his neck, the motion sharp and impatient.
A muted beep followed, and the steel door slid open without a sound.

Inside, the room was shrouded in gloom. The lights remained off, leaving only the neon glow of the city beyond the towering windows, streaks of pale blue and red dragging across the polished floor like restless shadows.

Hannah sat perched on the edge of the bed, her posture stiff and unyielding. The wedding dress still clung to her like a cruel reminder of everything she had lost. Her back remained turned to the door, shoulders locked in tense defiance.

Even the faint hiss of the door sliding open failed to draw her attention.

Vincent advanced into the room with measured, deliberate steps, saying nothing.

Hannah's voice sliced through the gloom before he could speak. "How is my mother?" she rasped, the sound raw, as though torn from her throat.

He stopped just behind her, so close that his presence pressed against her shoulders like a weight. His reply was clipped, almost cold. "She's in the hospital."

The silence that followed was heavy enough to crush the air between them.

Vincent's dark gaze dropped from the rigid line of her neck to the untouched tray of food beside her."Why haven't you eaten?" he asked, voice low but sharp.

She offered nothing back.

He waited, seconds dragging into something heavier.

A buried rage, one he had smothered all day, began to swell and harden in his chest, fed by her unyielding silence. That wedding dress-white, unblemished-turned into an intolerable provocation in his sight.

"What about Claude?" At last, Hannah's voice broke through, ragged but steady.
Vincent's throat bobbed with a sudden jerk, his pupils shrinking with sudden intensity. Without warning,he bent down, his icy grip clamping onto her delicate shoulder with the unyielding force of an iron shackle.
"So you still have the nerve to think about another man!" he growled, his voice low and trembling with a thread of intensely suppressed fury.

Hannah recoiled, startled into turning her face toward him. Looming above her, his features were carved in rage, darkened by a brewing tempest.

In one swift, merciless motion, he drove her down against the frigid mattress. His gaze fell on the wedding gown spread wide across the bed beneath her. It was nothing but a blight in his eyes.

The sharp tear of fabric split the silence. With a vicious tug, he ripped the dress apart, shredding the last symbol of her defiance.

"What the hell are you doing?" she gasped, her voice breaking between anger and disbelief as she thrashed against him.

"Claiming you," Vincent muttered, his tone sharp and absolute.
###Chapter 344 Do You Have Any Pills


"Stop!" Hannah clawed and thrashed wildly, her nails tearing into Vincent's arms and neck, carving several bleeding gashes almost at once.

Vincent flinched at the sting, his frame tightening instantly.

Yet, rather than easing, it only seemed to ignite his feral drive and hunger for control. He gaveno mercy,brutally crushing every ounce of her defiance and forcefully ramming into her.

"Ugh..." Hannah arched under the torment. She bit her lip, closed her eyes, and ceased her resistance,silently enduring his assault.

Her quiet submission only made him more aggressive as he thrust into hér.

"Look at me!" he growled in her ear.

Hannah refused to open her eyes, her lashes quivering as a lone tear slid down her cheek.

Vincent's movements halted. He noticed the tear. A piercing jolt-a sudden recognition-shot through his chest, draining much of his vicious fire. A dull, unexplainable ache surged within him.

Without thinking, he leaned down, his lips warm, a mix of desire and aggression in them, and pressed a gentle kiss to the tear.

Hannah shuddered fiercely and then collapsed, her strength drained.

Vincent's desire surged again, uncontrollable, as he had round after another round of intimacy with her.

Time slipped away before he finally pulled back, panting hard, sweat trickling from his rigid brow.

Beneath him, Hannah looked ghostly pale, her breathing shallow, lashes clenched tight, as though she had lost consciousness for quite some time.

Vincent's eyes widened as he confirmed that she had blacked out."Damn it!" he hissed, fumbling to gather
her up in a clumsy way foreign to his usual control.

Then, he lunged for the door, flung it wide, and barked to the butler in frantic alarm, "Fetch a doctor immediately!"

Moments later, the doctor appeared, rushing over with his medical case. After inspecting Hannah,he locked Vincent in a grave stare and delivered his conclusion with a faint, weighted implication. "Mr. Jones,her glucose level collapsed. Her emotions were severely strained, her frame fragile, and the violent exertion surpassed her capacity, leading to her fainting."

Vincent listened silently, his expression unreadable.

Once Hannah was stabilized with a nutrient infusion, the doctor withdrew.

The butler arrived carrying water and a heated cloth, and Vincent dismissed him with a quiet motion.

The following morning, Hannah's eyes fluttered open slowly. The stiffness in her limbs and the sharp soreness in her private parts reminded her of last night's ordeal.

Turning slightly, she caught sight of Vincent seated in an armchair beside the bed. He hadn't left. He wore refined dark-gray loungewear, holding a tablet as though occupied with work.

Vincent caught her stirring from the edge of his vision and glanced over. "You're awake?"

Hannah didn't respond.

Vincent seemed unfazed by her silence. He walked toward the door and murmured quiet orders.

Soon, the butler appeared, carrying a tray with a carefully prepared breakfast. He set it neatly on the stand and stepped out of the room with deference.

Vincent returned to the bedside, picked up a bowl of steaming soup, stirred lightly, and brought a spoonfu close to Hannah's shut mouth. "Today, I'll watch you eat," he said, his voice calm but carrying unmistakable authority.

Hannah turned her head away, clearly refusing.
Vincent's hand hovered, unmoving, waiting with patience.

The faint chime of the spoon against the bowl echoed through the strained quiet.

After a long moment, Hannah's vacant gaze fixed on the ceiling. Her voice hoarse but steady, she asked a question that made Vincent's pupils constrict in an instant. "Do you have any pills?"

Vincent froze with the bowl in hand. His voice droppoed."What kind of pills?"

Hannah finally met his gaze, her eyes piercing. "Emergency contraception."

Every syllable landed sharp, disgust hidden beneath composure. "Last night, you didn't use protection."
###Chapter 345 Bind Her To Him With A Child


The air seemed to freeze in an instant.

Vincent's entire demeanor shifted, hardening intoice. The very first thought that flashed through Hannah's mind upon waking was how to erase every trace that tied her to him.

A wave of fierce, offended anger surged through Vincent, followed closely by something heavier, darker-an unspoken fear.

"No." Vincent's voice cut through the silence, cold, edged faintly with hostility.

Hannah's lips twisted into a sharp, mocking smile, her eyes slicing into him with glacial disdain. "No? Do you honestly want me to bring a child into this miserable place?" Her tohe dripped with scorn,every word sharpened to wound.
"And what if I do?" Vincent slammed the soup bowl onto the bedside table with a dull, echoing thud. He leaned in, caging her against the mattress with his arms braced on either side. "I want you to bear my child."

It was his plan-to bind her to him irrevocably with a child. He had never once regretted taking her away from that damned wedding. And he had no intention of ever letting her go.

"Bastard!" Hannah's fury exploded at his shameless confession. She raised her hand to shove him away, but he caught her wrist with effortless strength.

Ignoring her curses and frantic struggles, Vincent lifted the bowl again, pressing it firmly against her lips.His command came low and unyielding. "Drink."

Hannah jerked her head aside, lips sealed tight in silent rebellion.

Vincent studied her defiance, his gaze darkening, a dangerous edge settling over him. His grip on the spoon tightened, knuckles whitening, his voice falling into a menacing whisper. "Not drinking? Fine."

He leaned closer, his breath hot against her ear. "I don't mind feeding you myself."
Hannah recoiled, knowing all too well this madman was capable of following through. In the end, under the weight of his relentless stare, though her heart screamed in protest, she gave in.

She reached out-not for the spoon, but for the wvarm bowl itself, snatching it from his hand with a burst of pent-up rage. Tilting her head back, she drank it down in one defiant gulp.

The next second, she slammed the empty bowl on the table with a sharp, ringing clatter.

Vincent's eyes flickered as he caught theflicker of pain buried in her forced calm, a pang he had not expected to feel. But that fleeting ache dissolved quickly, replaced by the grim satisfaction her compliance stirred.

Straightening to his full height, his tone returned to measured calm, as though the earlier confrontation had never occurred. "Good. Lunch will be delivered on time. And remember, I'll be watching you eat."

With that, he picked up the tablet from the sofa and strode toward the door.

The heavy metal door closed behind him with a sound too soft for its weight, followed by the sharp click of the lock.

Once again, Hannah was alone.

She sat for a long moment, scanning the lavish room, her resolve crystallizing into a single thought-she had to escape.

At lunchtime, the heavy door slid open.

Vincent stepped inside, carrying a tray of food.

The lunch was even more extravagant than breakfast, prepared with deliberate care.

Hannah sat in the single chair by the window, swallowed up in his oversized black shirt. She didn't resist intensely as she did this morning.

When Vincent placed the meal before her, she didn't look at him. She picked up her utensils and ate in slow,measured bites-obedient, mechanical,detached.
Vincent watched her in silence, his lips gradually loosening from their tense line. She finally ate on her own accord. This small act of submission eased the tension in his chest, if only a little. He needed her alive,healthy, and at his side.

Hannah forced each bite past the nausea curling in her stomach. She reminded herself again and again-she had to preserve her strength if she wanted any chance of escaping.

For days, she maintained this facade of compliance.

Then one day, Hannah broke the pattern. She lifted her gaze and asked Vincent to join her.

They ate together quietly, no words exchanged, until Hannah had nearly finished her plate. Setting down her utensils, she dabbed the corner of her lips with a napkin. Her eyes lifted to his, her voice soft,carefully laced with pleading. "I want to go for a walk."

Vincent's gaze sharpened, cutting into her,though he said nothing at first.

Hannah met his eyes without wavering, her tone gentler, tinged with submission. "Couldn't I stroll for a bit with you?"

It was the first time she had suggested spending time by his side, even if only for a walk. Something inside Vincent softened at the rare gesture.

After a tense pause, his deep voice rumbled. "Half an hour, then."

Hannah nodded gently, her tone still light, still yielding. "Okay." Her chest loosened with relief. This was it-the first step toward freedom.
###Chapter 346 Wearing His Shirt


Vincent didn't take Hannah far. He stayed close at her side as they left the lavish suite together.

At last, Hannah's eyes traced the boundaries of the′′prrison" that held her. It wasn't some grand villa, but a private fortress-sleek, unyielding, and overwhelmingly secure. The air itself seemed heavy with vigilance.

Her gaze swept the walls and ceilings, spotting pinprick camera lenses cleverly concealed in corners,tucked into decorative niches, and hidden along the edges of the ceiling. No angle escaped the unblinking watch of the surveillance system. Every step she took fell within its sight.

At measured intervals, men in tailored black suits stood rooted like statues, their presence a silent warning that escape was not even a possibility.

Vincent kept a half-step at Hannah's side, his tall frame radiating a quiet, suffocating dominance. Though his eyes appeared to skim the corridor in casual indifference, their focus never wavered from her.

On the surface, Hannah walked with measured calm, her pace unhurried, but her fingers tightened around the cuffs of the oversized shirt she wore.

Beneath that stillness, her heart sank deeper and deeper, heavy with unease. A forceful escape? That was pure hell's fantasy-utterly impossible.

Vincent's voice, low and resonant, cut through the silence. "Whatever it is you want, just tell me." He tilted his head slightly, his sharp eyes catching her delicate profile. "As long as you stay here obediently."

Hannah froze mid-step, her breath catching in her throat. Lifting her chin with deliberate slowness, she met his gaze. "Anything at all?" she asked, her voice soft yet edged with quiet testing.

"That's right," Vincent confirmed, his stare unwavering, a smoldering weight that locked her in place.

Hannah's heart began to pound violently within her chest. This was the opening she had been waiting for.

Lowering her lashes, she concealed the fleeting spark of calculation that flickered in her eyes. Her tone
1.0.1
slipped into something shy, touched with a trace of reliance. "L.. I don't have anything to wear."

Her fingers toyed with the hem of the oversized black shirt draped over her frame-his shirt. "I can't keep walking around dressed in this forever."

She tilted her gaze toward him, a quiet plea gleaming against his unbreakable eyes. "I'd like to go out and buy some clothes. With you."

Vincent's piercing gaze remained locked on her, his answer coming with surprising ease. "Fine,"

For a heartbeat, she froze. Had he really agreed so quickly? The unexpectedness of it almost knocked the breath from her chest. This was her only chance. Among a crowd, she could slip away-freedom might finally be within reach.

Her heart hammered, threatening to betray her excitement. She pressed her lips together, willing her face into calm composure, softening her voice into one of measured surprise tinged with hope. "Then when do we leave?"

A hint of satisfaction curved his mouth, born from the thrill of keeping her within the palm of his hand.′′We′∥ go right now."

He then pivoted sharply and strode ahead, setting the pace without hesitation.

Yet, instead of veering toward the garage, he advanced deeper into the corridor, leading her straight toward the fortress's very front-the grand main hall.

A subtle crease formed between Hannah's brows, a chill of unease whispering through her chest. Still, the spark of hope was too imnmediate to abandon; she smothered her doubts and quickened her steps to keep close behind him.

They crossed beneath a wide arched doorway, and the space suddenly opened around her.

A sharp breath snagged in her throat. The sight that met her eyes rooted her to thefloor, as though the blood in her veins had frozen solid. Vincent had never intended to take her outside. What spread before her was not freedom, but a lavishly arranged surprise: the entire main hall transformed into a temporary,extravagant clothing showroom.
The expansive room had been neatly carved into several sections, each carefully curated. Along the edges,rows of professional attendants stood poised, every one immaculately styled, their polished smiles betraying no hint of fatigue as they waited for instructions.

Vincent gave a quiet clap, the sound sharp in the hall.

From a discreet side door, four young women stepped out in an orderly line. Though each possessed a different face, their silhouettes were eerily uniform-their height, curves, and proportions all a near mirror of Hannah's own.

"These will serve as your fittingmodels." Vincent's low voice brushed against her ear,threaded with the quiet dominance of someone who expected no refusal. "Their figures match yours almost exactly-height,shoulders, leg length... The difference won't exceed a centimeter."

With a sweep of his hand, he indicated the glittering display of clothes as though unveiling some ingenious creation. "Choose any style you fancy," he continued, his gaze steady on Hannah. "They'll try it on so you can see the effect for yourself. If anything pleases you, it's yours. Any adjustments you need, professionals will perfect to your specifications."

In his mind, this arrangement was not only seamless but surprisingly thoughtful. "This way, you'll be able to pick out everything you like in the fastest, most comfortable way possible."

Bang! It felt like something had detonated inside her skull. He was toying with her. He had never intended to take her outside.

Still, Hannah forced herself to stay composed. Her mind churned furiously, clawing for a way-out. She feigned irritation, adding a touch of fluster to her voice. "Sure, they can model these outfits for me-but what about undergarments? Am I supposed to have them try those on in my place too?"
###Chapter 347 Emptied The Place Beforehand For Her


Hannah's gaze lingered on the row of four models, each one echoing her own silhouette, before sliding back to Vincent. "How could I possibly know if something this intimate will fit or feel right just by staring at them?" she asked, her brow arching.

The bluntness of her question knocked Vincent off balance. For a moment, he just looked at her, struck by the sharp light in her eyes. This vibrant, defiant woman felt worlds apart from the dull, lifeless figure from earlier.

Before he could think better of it, his voice broke through, low and impulsive. "I'll take you out myself-shopping."

Hannah's expression stayed cold, betraying no trace of her immense joy. She drifted toward the racks of clothing and sifted through them with quick, decisive fingers. "I'll change into something more appropriate for going out," she said.

Without much thought, she grabbed an outfit casually, headed to a room, slipped into it, and reappeared in minutes.

Vincent had taken the reins himself, mapping out the entire outing in meticulous detail.

A sleek convoy of cars glided through the streets, moving with practiced precision until they pulled up outside the city's most exclusive luxury mall.

Hannah stepped out of the car, brimming with anticipation-only to feel her excitement crumble the moment her eyes took in the scene.

Flanking the mall entrance, rows of bodyguards stood like statues, identical in their black suits and mirrored earpieces, their presence radiating authority.

Inside, the vast shopping area, usually buzzing with chatter and footsteps, was eerily vacant-every trace of the public had been cleared away.
Vincent had clearly ordered the place to be emptied beforehand. The vast shopping mall now served solely her.

Hannah's chest tightened, the thrilI of her plan dissolving into disappointment. She had counted on the safety of a bustling crowd, and now that cover was gone. Still, she forced herself not to falter. Panic couldn't show-not even for a second.

She steadied her breathing, pushing the frustration deep down, and then lifted her chin with amock-stern look. "Isn't this going overboard?" she said, her voice laced with dry reproach."A∥this just for me to buy some underwear?"

Vincent's tone carried a steady authority."It's quiet this way. No one will intrude on your shopping."

For the rest of their time inside, Hannah slipped her arm through Vincent's and acted thoroughly interested,drifting with him from boutique to boutique in the lingerie section.

She occasionally lifted a piece from the rack, holding it up with unflinching poise as she turned to him for an opinion, her voice casual and teasing.

"What do you think-too pink?"

"And this one-does it look a little too daring?"

She carried herself like a woman genuinely intent on choosing the perfect lingerie, every movement deliberate, every glance at the racks convincingly absorbed.

Watching her so focusèd, Vincent's rigid guard gradually eased.

By the time they entered the fifth boutique, Hannah had already gathered several elaborate pieces-delicate lacework that needed careful threading up the back, and a shaping design fastened with an endless row of hooks.

She held them up with a faint smile and turned toward Vincent. "These look pretty good," she said casually."I'll try them on and see if they're actually comfortable."

Just as Hannah lifted the curtain to step into the fitting room, Vincent's private phone buzzed sharply. He
shifted a few paces away, answering with a clipped, "It's me. Speak."

In an instant, his tone carried the cold authority of the Jones Group's head, every syllable controlled and commanding.

Inside the fitting room, Hannah clutched the complicated lingerie pieces in her arms, though she made no move to try them on.

Through the thin partition, she caught Vincent's deep, clipped tone, and beyond that, the restless shuffle of bodyguards stationed in the hallway.

Her pulse quickened. Without allowing hesitation to creep in, she lifted the piece with the intricate lacing,stepped closer to the curtain, and tugged it open just a fraction. Leaning forward, her voice hushed yet deliberate, she called out, "Excuse me, miss?"

The sales associate immediately stepped closer and answered politely through the curtain, "Yes, ma'am?How can I assist you?"

Dropping her voice, Hannah let a trace of calculated frustration seep in.′′WVould you mind stepping in for a moment? There are too many straps on this piece, and I can't figure out the lacing. I've been fiddling with it,but I just can't get it right by myself."

To emphasize her point, she gave the delicate lingerie a little shake.

The sales associate nodded quickly. "Absolutely, ma'am. I'Il take care of it right away."

Easing the curtain aside, the sales associate slipped into the tiny booth and let the heavy fabric fall shut,sealing them in.

The cramped fitting room now held only Hannah and the sales associate.

As the sales associate lifted the lingerie, ready to demonstrate how the laces were meant to be threaded,Hannah suddenly caught her wrist-swiftly yet without force. With her other hand, she pressed a finger against her lips, a silent plea for quiet.

"Quiet, not a word!" Hannah's whisper carried a sharp edge of urgency, low enough for only the sales
associate to catch.

Hannah leaned closer, her tone softening into a hushed grumble. "That man outside is my husband.Whenever we go shopping, he's always buried in work and never spares me a moment. Today's no exception. So I'm thinking to slip away for just a bit-let's see how long it takes him to realize I've vanished.Maybe it'll teach him a small lesson."

Hannah forced her features into the sulky pout of a young wife fed up with her inattentive husband. "Maybe then he'll finally look up from his phone the next time we're out together. So, could you help me? It's honestly the simplest favor."

Her eyes glimmered with imploring innocence, and the sales associate wavered, clearly torn.
###Chapter 348 She Escaped


Hannah was taking a reckless chance. She was counting on the sales associate not working for Vincent.

The sales associate blinked uncertainly before asking, "How exactly do you want me to help with?"

Relief slipped out of Hannah in a quiet exhale, and she leaned in quickly. "It's quite simple. Take off your uniform jacket and lend it to me. I'll put it on, walk out like some staff, and vanish for a few minutes.Meanwhile, you stay close outside the fitting room and pretend I'm still inside. My husband won't catch on right away. Once my husband starts to panic and comes looking, I'll sneak back. What do you think?Exciting, right?" She forced a playful grin, though her fingers clutched nervously at her sides.

The sales associate looked completely thrown. Her eyes flicked from, Hannah's imploring expression to outside the fitting room, where the intimidating man waited, with the mall manager flashing a fawning smile at him. "I... I'm not sure. This doesn't feel right."

That hesitation was Hannah's cue-time to play her last card. She pointed at the pile of delicate, high-end lingerie she had chosen, her voice brimming with certainty and a teasing edge. "I'll take everything I picked.Box it all up and charge it to my husband's account-price doesn't matter. And every cent goes straight to your commission."

This promise meant a massive payout. The sales associate felt the tug of temptation. Such a huge sale promised an equally hefty bonus, and nothing about this plead seemed risky. To her, it looked more like a game between a wealthy couple eager to add a little spark.

The sales associate drew in a quick breath and leaned closer, her voice dropping to a whisper."We're not really supposed to take off our uniforms..."

Hannah's stomach tightened in disappointment.

But then, the sales associate swiftly offered,"|do have a spare uniform in the locker room. Stay here-I'll fetch it for you."
Hannah's face brightened, and she leaned closer, whispering urgently, "Perfect! Please be quick-he's almost done with that call."

Less than a minute later, the sales associate returned, clutching the spare uniform.

Hannah wasted no time.

She slipped into the outfit, smoothing the fabric into place, and then tugged free her high ponytail so her thick, glossy hair tumbled over her shoulders, altering her look just enough to slip under notice.

Hannah gave one final instruction, her tone low but firm. "Keep pretending I'm still in here trying on underwear. You don't know a thing. When my husband comes looking for me, just calmly wrap up the lingerie and ring it up, saying these are the pieces I picked."

The sales associate nodded quickly, her eyes wide.

Hannah's gaze wavered between gratitude and unease. Drawing in a steadying breath, she schooled her features into a composed mask, the image of a shop girl finishing her shift.

She pulled back the heavy velvet curtain and stepped out, her stride slow but steady, confidence draped over her like armor.

Vincent still stood there, his back to the fitting room, brow furrowed as he barked into the phone,completely unaware of her quiet escape.

The two female bodyguards barely spared Hannah a glance as she emerged.
Hannah's palms were slick with sweat, but she steadied her breath and moved with practiced ease. Instead of heading for the door, she drifted toward a nearby rack, fussing with the already perfect display of lingerie as though she were just another employee. Her gestures flowed with ease, her presence calm and steady.

The bodyguards' eyes lingered briefly before sliding away,convinced she was nothing more than a sales associate on the clock.

Hannah rearranged a few more pieces and then casually angled herself toward the boutique's entrance.

Nobody moved to block her. A moment later, she slipped out into the mall without a hitch. Yet, the open
space beyond the shop hardly promised safety-was she truly beyond his reach?

Inside, Vincent ended his call and strode toward the fitting room. "Still not finished?" he inquired, his voice edged with impatience.

Not a single reply came. He jerked the curtain aside, only to find the fitting room empty. Could it be that Hannah had escaped? Had she orchestrated this all along? The lingerie shopping turned out to be just a pretense.

The realization slammed into him, and rage sharpened his voice. "Where the fuck did she go?"

One of the female bodyguards faltered, panic flickering across her face. "We... We didn't see her leave."

Vincent's gaze shot to the mall entrance, his tone dropping to an icy command that reverberated through the sprawling space. "Don't just stand there-find her! Shut every door and get her back here now!"

Within moments, his black-suited men scattered in all directions, their movements precise and merciless.

Vincent's expression darkened like a storm front. How the hell did Hannah think she could slip away from him?
###Chapter 349 Vincent Had Found Her


Hannah stilled her breathing, straining her ears as Vincent ordered his bodyguards to sweep the exterior. A faint exhale of relief slipped through her lips. It was just as she had anticipated-Vincent assumed she had bolted from the lingerie store.

Yet, earlier, at the very threshold, Hannah had altered her plan. Rather than escape, she had slipped into the staff lounge tucked inside. For the time being, this confined room seemed far more secure than anything beyond those walls.

Hannah borrowed a mobile phone from one of the sales associates, desperate to reach Claude without delay. She was eager to confirm her mother's safety.

Willing herself to stay composed, she swiftly tapped Claude's number. But the only reply was a relentless busy tone.

Again and again, she attempted, but not a single call went through. Was Claude tied up with something urgent? Or did he decline to pick up an unfamiliar line?

A piercing chill settled into Hannah's chest, dragging waves of suffocating fear over her.

And then, steps rang in the corridor, drawing nearer, echoing straight toward the lounge entrance.

Hannah's pulse shot upward in her throat. Who could it be? Had Vincent tracked her so quickly?"

The handle turned, and the door eased open.

Hannah jerked around, pressing her spine against the chilled edge of the desk, her expression fixed in forced steadiness.

But in the doorway stood a middle-aged woman clad in the crisp attire of a manager. She appeared freshly arrived and clearly had no idea who Hannah was.

A trace of relief loosened Hannah's chest.
The manager's brow furrowed, her stare sharp, voice clipped and irritated. "Break time is finished. Why aren't you out asssting shoppers? Calls during shifts are prohibited. You should know better."

Since Hannah still wore the sales associate's uniform, the manager mistook her for a junior worker.

Relief at avoiding capture, tangled with the sting of sudden tension, made Hannah's heart pound painfully.She forced herself to speak evenly. "I'll step out soon. It's a family crisis-I must make this call."

"Emergency or not, regulations are regulations!" the manager barked, her scowl deepening, her words stern. "Rules are rules! Look how busy it is out there! Everyone else is working flat out. If you keep loitering and phoning, you can consider yourself dismissed! End that call and get on the floor!"

"I'm going right now," Hannah replied, but her attention never left the phone. She pressed redial again.

When Hannah still refused to let go of the phone, the manager bristled with fury. She gave a sharp, angry snort. "I won't repeat myself! Out now!"

With that, the manager spun on her heel and stormed off, clearly intending to wait for Hannah outside.

Hannah persisted, redial after redial. On what felt like the tenth attempt, Claude finally picked up. But before she could speak, a figure burst into the room.

In a single stride, Vincent closed the gap and ripped the phone from Hannah's grasp.

Her blood froze. Her head turned stiffly. Vincent had found her after all.

Claude's voice echoed faintly from the device. "Hello? Who is speaking?"

Vincent's face was shadowed with grimness as he cut the line. "Return with me," he said, his tone deep and menacing.

"I won't go back!" Hannah snapped icily. She had clawed too hard for freedom; she would never surrender it.

In a sudden burst, she bolted from the lounge, shoving past the manager and sales associates, sprinting for the transparent front doors of the lingerie shop.
But waiting beyond the glass stood a line of Vincent's bodyguards, their presence forming a barricade.

"Step aside!" Hannah cried fiercely, but no one moved.

The bodyguards held their ground, statues carved in silence.

The air grew thick with pressure.

Then, Vincent emerged from the lounge, his footsteps slow, deliberate. He fixed his eyes on Hannah and repeated, his voice commanding, "You are coming back with me."

Hannah whirled back, her glare blazing with defiance. "I said no!"

Vincent's stare cut sharply, a cruel smirk tugging his mouth. "That choice isn't yours."

With that, he advanced, and in one swift motion, he bent down, arms locking around her back and knees.Her world flipped without warning.

Hannah felt herself slung like an object, hoisted over Vincent's shoulder without mercy.

Though she thrashed and kicked with everything she had, Vincent showed no sign of pain, his grip only tightening further.

Inside the stretch limousine, he hurled her onto the seats. Once he dismissed his bodyguards, the fury he had been restraining finally erupted. WVithout hesitation, he grabbed the collar of her sales associate uniform and tore it down.

An abrupt shredding sòund tore through the air.

"Get your hands off me!" Hannah fought back fiercely.

Vincent dismissed all of her resistance without notice. He wrestled her arms up and pinned them against the icy glass of the window. He then forced her legs apart with his knee in one stroke, rendering all her efforts futile. Without pause, he leaned and thrust into her violently.
She cried out as his full length drove into her with a force that sent a searing pain through her body,causing her to curl forward. In a fit of overwhelming pain, her hands dug viciously into the flesh of his arms, breaking
the surface and spilling blood.

He pressed nearer, his breath searing against her damp neck and ear. His teeth closed on her earlobe as he snarled, "Still think you can run?"
###Chapter 350 Don't Waste Your Energy Trying To Escape


Hannah drew on the last fragments of willpower within her frame, her tone rasped yet rang with fierce determination. "Vincent, as long as I'm still breathing, I'll find a way out."

Vincent released a sinister chuckle, fury igniting in his gaze like a raging inferno. "Very well." In the next instant, he rammed into her again-harsher, rougher, more merciless than before. "Then I'll make sure you never have the strength to run again. I'll see to it you never forget who you belong to."

Each motion was brutal-designed to crush her spirit, to make escape a distant fantasy.

Inside the vehicle, the only sounds were broken gasps, muted impacts of bodies colliding, and muffled sobs that filled the airless chamber.

Abruptly, he drove into her with such savage force that it seemed he meant to crush her into the seat.

His mouth slammed onto hers-not tender, but a vicious, punishing bite.

"Ah!" Hannah wrenched her face aside, straining with every ounce of fight to avoid his onslaught

But Vincent's grasp on her chin was ironclad. He forced her face back, capturing her lips once more with unrestrained brutality.

His restraint had vanished entirely. He ravaged her mouth with frenzy steeped in blood and cruelty.

Unable to dodge further, she struck back the only way left-her teeth sank into his lower lip with all her force.

Vincent spat a hiss as the sting and metallic taste filled him.

Seizing that flicker of weakness, Hannah shoved his face away, scambling to pull herself upright.

But Vincent only grew wilder, dragging her beneath him once again. His mouth, scorching and unyielding,burned across her jaw down to her throat, while his hands roamed over her body without permission or pause.
Hannah clamped her teeth until her jaw throbbed. She refused to plead, refused to break. She denied him that victory.

Moments dissolved. At the end, the vehicle lay in disarray, garments scattered.

Vincent's chest rose with labored breaths. The storm within him slowly eased, ebbing like a retreating tide.

Hannah never shifted her gaze toward him. He removed his jacket and placed it over her.

She recoiled. He studied her still, drained profile-and the disturbance in his chest only tightened.

Silence consumed the vehicle.

At last, Vincent muttered a command, and the car started toward the secluded estate, hidden within the city, encircled by walls and armed sentries.

When the car halted, Vincent stepped out without sparing Hannah anóther look. His features were blank,stripped of emotion.

Outside, guards and household staff awaited.

"Take her upstairs. Return her to the chamber." Vincent's voice was frigid and detached, as if none of it bore weight.

Two attendants approached cautiously, helping Hannah out of the vehicle. Her knees faltered, unable to hold her upright. She drifted with them like a shadow-silent, hollow.

Vincent lingered, watching her weakened frame half-dragged away, his stare impossible to decipher.

Hannah was led back into the opulent suite where she had been confined before.

Vincent entered soon after. He observed her step into the bathroom. Soon, the rush of water echoed within.

He leaned against the wall, waiting in wordless stillness.

Time crawled. Eventually, the sound ceased.

Hannah reappeared. She had bathed and clothed herself in fresh lounge attire. Damp strands clung to her,
her complexion pale, her eyes stripped of light.

Without a glance his way, she moved directly to thetall window, staring at the enclosed courtyard outside.

Vincent followed, halting a few steps behind.

For a long interval, quiet reigned. Then, his voice broke it, low and edged with control. "Don't waste your energy trying to escape. You won't succeed."

Hannah's frame tensed, slight but telling. She didn't turn. Her eyes held to the thin strip of sky above the high enclosure. Her voice, rasped and dry, carried a calm that was chilling. "Vincent, do you truly mean to cage me for my lifetime?"

Vincent stared at her fragile yet unyielding outline. An unseen fist seemed to clench around his chest once more. He advanced a step, speaking as though it were a simple truth. "If you abandon thoughts of Claude Hobbes and bring my child into this world, this place will grant you everything imaginable."

A soft, bitter sound escaped her mouth. She did not scream. She did not weep. She only turned-slow,deliberate. Her eyes locked with his. They held no fear, no doubt. Only an icy, piercing certainty-one that ripped through every fantasy he clung to.

She parted her lips, and two words fell like a dagger, "Never happening."
###Chapter 351 Forbidden To Carry His Child


Those two words from Hannah ripped apart the fragile restraint Vincent had fought to keep intact."Never happening?" His fury erupted without warning. The atmosphere sharpened, charged with hostility.

Vincent lunged forward, his towering figure drowning her in shadow. "What exactly do you mean by 'never happening,'Hannah? You can't erase Claude from your memories? Or you refuse to carry my child?"

Hannah raised her chin, locking her gaze on his wrath. Her stare-icy,cutting-showed not a trace of fear.She said nothing, but that silence stung more than a spoken reply, as if it screamed, "Don't you already know?"

"Hannah Scott!" Vincent snarled, seizing her chin with a brutal grip, shortening their distance by pulling her in. His breath scorched against her skin. "Do you really believe I won't touch you again?"

"Touch me?" Her jaw throbbed from his hold, but no defeat shadowed her features. If anything, something flared in the hollowness of her eyes. A blaze.

With one sudden, merciless snap, she slapped his hand aside. And before Vincent's shocked stare, she grabbed the hem of her loungewear top and yanked it off. Her skin, still traced with marks he had left, was fully exposed.

She didn't flinch. Then, she ripped away her pants-along with the thin underwear beneath-and flung them onto the carpet like refuse.

Barefoot, she strode to the sofa, turned, and dropped onto it in one smooth sweep. She sprawled wide body unhidden, legs parted.

She looked straight at him. There was no embarrassment in her eyes. Only a burning, ruinous defiance."Come on, then." Her voice wasn't loud, but it sliced the stillness like a blade. "Do it,Vincent."

She angled her chin higher, her lips twisting into a mocking, blade-thin smile."Isn't this what you like the most? Forcing me to break? Then proceed. Here. Now."
Every vein in Vincent's body pulsed upward to his skull-only to lock still. A violent, unfamiliar jolt of panic gripped him like a vice. "You think I don't dare?" His tone rasped, raw, as though shouting at himself.

He moved toward the sofa, but every step dragged, torn by reluctance.

Hannah just stared at him with frozen eyes, unshaken. No terror. Only steel.

Moments of dead silence pressed on them.

Vincent's fists coiled so hard that the knuckles whitened, veins swelling along their ridges. He searched those defiant, lifeless eyes, and at last, the strain in his fists collapsed into surrender. He spun away."Get some rest," he muttered, voice roughened low.

Without another glance at her, he cut for the door, his exit laced with a rare trace of disarray.

But just as his hand neared the door handle, a coffee mug smashed into the back of his head. Without warning. Without hesitation. Hannah had flung it with all her strength.

A blunt, ringing thud cracked the silence. Vincent stumbled forward, his large framne pitching under the blow.Pain roared through the back of his skull.

Still, he did not face her. He ripped the door open and stormed out.

The heavy metal door crashed shut behind him, locking with a mechanical snap.

Outside, in the corridor, Vincent ignored the sting on his head. He beckoned the butler. "Bring some medicine," he ordered curtly.

The butler froze, eyeing the disheveled state of his employer. A thought crossed his mind-a logical one, he assumed-and he asked cautiously, "Should I fetch some emergency contraception?"

Vincent's head whipped around. "Emergency contraception?" he echoed, voice lethal-sharp. His glare cut like a blade. "Why the hell would she need that?"

The butler collapsed to his knees with a crack. "I-I beg your pardon, Mr. Jones! | misspoke! | only thought...I assumed she might..."
"Assumed?" Vincent's voice dripped ice. "Clarify. Now."

His mind raced. Had Hannah secretly asked the butler for birth control? A swell of rage and alarm surged inside him.

Sweat drenched the butler's back. HHe dared not lie. "T-the maids have whispered," he faltered. "They said the lady's origins are uncertain, and since you guard her so tightly, perhaps she's... Perhaps she's someone you care for but can't reveal in public..."

His words dwindled quieter with each breath, hisforehead nearly brushing the floor. "They said perhaps she's forbidden to carry your child. So they guessed she might require birth control."

Cannot reveal in public? Forbidden to bear his child? Vincent's gaze darkened, his fury radiating like flame.So this was what they whispered of Hannah behind his back?
###Chapter 352 Can't Even Hold It In This Early In The Morning


An avalanche of remorse crashed over Vincent. From their hidden union to him dragging Hannah away by force,he had never once given her the dignity of a real title. He was indebted to her. Utterly.

Vincent's voice thundered, sharp with authority, "Let it be known. The woman inside is not some disgraceful secret plaything. She is Hannah Scott-the mistress of this estate, and the sole one I will ever recognize as my wife. Any servant caught slandering her-dismiss them. All of them. No exceptions."

He paused. His next words fell softer, tinged with a concern he had not admitted even to himself. "And fetch the medicine. The finest available, for bruises and aching muscles."

The butler caught his meaning instantly. He did not dare delay. "Yes! Right away!" He scurried away,nearly stumbling in his haste.

Not long after, the ointment was delivered to the room where Hannah was confined. But she ignored it. Her mind worked, calculating and searching for another way out.

Elsewhere, Vincent had undone his tie, preparing to step into the shower, when the device on the counter began to ring. It was Claude on the line.

After days of sending men to shadow Vincent and returning with nothing, this was the first moment Claude had chosen to call him.

Vincent's eyes dimmed as he stared at the glowing screen. Several seconds passed before he answered in silence, only lifting it tohis ear.

"Vincent Jones!" Claude's voice exploded through the line, thick with fury and desperation. "Where the hell have you hidden Hannah?"
Claude had burned through every favor, every lead, chasing Vincent's convoys like a mad hound, only to be outmaneuvered again and again. Hannah's absence gnawed at him, driving him to the brink of madness.

Vincent's mouth twisted into a scornful smile. His reply was cold, detached, as though stating a trivial fact.
"Unable to find her? That just means you're incompetent."

"You!" Claude nearly gagged on his rage. Forcing steadiness into his breath, his tone shifted,now harder and laced with strategy. "I didn't call to quarrel. The day after tomorrow marks Hannah's father's burial. She is his only child. She must be there to send him off." It was his final leverage, the last thread by which he might reclaim Hannah.

"If you retain even a sliver of conscience," Claude pressed, his voice edged with threat, "you will not rob her of bidding farewell to her father. If you dare, she will never forgive you. Not for as long as she lives."

Vincent's hold on the phone tightened. Forgiveness? A hollow laugh stirred in his chest. Hannah had already hated his guts-she resented him with every fiber of her being. From the instant he confined her-perhaps even earlier-that hatred had sunk deep, lodging into her very bones.

On the line, Claude mistook Vincent's silence for wavering. He continued, urgent, "Do you hear me? This is the least a daughter owes her father. You cannot strip that away. Bring her to the funeral."

Vincent's response came at last-low, glacial, each word carrying unyielding finality."Claude Hobbes, you don't get a say in her life. Know your place."
Without waiting for an answer, Vincent severed the call and hurled the device onto the counter. He ripped open the top buttons of his shirt, his collarbone catching the light, while frustration burned beneath his skin.

-..
The night stretched on without rest.

Vincent pushed through the door of Hannah's chamber. She was curled on the mattress, a flimsy cover draped over her form, appearing still asleep.

The ointment box, delivered the evening before, sat untouched upon the side table-still sealed in its wrapping.She had not used it.

Vincent's brow tightened, his steps carrying an edge of roughness. With one swift motion, he tore the blanket from her body.
Hannah jolted awake, her frame immediately rigid. Her eyes opened, locking onto Vincent drawing near, and wariness immediately flared within her gaze. His hands moved to tear at her clothing, intent on stripping them away. He was about to force her again...

Shame flooded her, igniting her instincts to resist. She shot upright, retreating back, her stare sharpened with venomous loathing. Her tone rasped, yet laced with undisguised ridicule. "Mr. Jones, can't even hold it in this early in the morning?"

She carved out a crooked, bitter smile, leaning forward slightly, parting her legs by the smallest margin."Go on. It's not like it's the first time."
###Chapter 353 Gentler


Vincent froze in place.That was truly how Hannah saw him?

He looked at Hannah-her body stiff, as though bracing for another assault-and a sharp wave of pain cut through him, mingling with a fury he could neither name nor contain. "Shut up!" he snarled, his voice heavy with restrained anger.
In one swift motion, he seized the collar of her sleepwear. With a harsh tug, the fabric tore open, baring her undergarments and the scattered bruises across her skin-some dark, others fading into pale shadows.

Hannah's eyes blazed, her posture defiant, as though waiting for the violence to begin.

But he didn't move the way she expected. Instead of pouncing on her,'his expression tightened. His gaze,dark and conflicted, swept over every glaring mark on her body.

Then, without another word, he turned, grabbed the unopened box of ointment from the table, and flipped it open.He pressed the tube, letting a bead of cool cream collect on his fingertip.

Leaning closer, his rough but chilled fingers-hesitant, almost clumsy-brushed against the worst bruise on her collarbone. The cold touch, laced with the faint scent of medicine, seeped into her skin.

Hannah shivered at once. He wasn't trying to claim her-he was treating her wounds?

His touch carried no viblence. It was awkwardly gentle, as though he feared adding to her pain.

She had imagined countless possibilities for what would happen when he barged in at dawn. Rape. Mockery.Endless torment. But never this. The realization left her unsettled. Leaning back, she said sharply, "I'll do it myself."

"No," Vincent countered, his tone imperious as always. "How could you possibly reach the spots you can't even see?"

She assumed he meant her back and remained resistant. "Then have a maid do it." She wanted to cut off
every shred of contact with him.

But the very next second, Vincent yanked down her pants, and Hannah let out a startled, panicked scream.His cool,ointment-coated fingers moved closer-toward her private parts.

"What are you being shy for? It's not like I haven't seen it before." His voice was calm, though his movements stayed tentative, inexperienced.

A flush of shame swept over Hannah, and she struggled with all her strength. Yet, Vincent effortlessly overpowered her resistance.

"Don't move. It's swollen." His voice dropped low, rough, unsteady.

"Isn't that your fault?" Hannah snapped, her head lifting, her eyes blazing with hatred and accusation.

Vincent's fingers, midway through applying the ointment, paused slightly. He raised his gaze and met her unwavering stare.

Seconds stretched.

"Yeah." His reply came quietly, stripped of feeling. Then, without pause, he resumed his movements, his voice dropping even lower, as though stating a plain promise. "Next time, I'll be gentler."

Hannah erupted. Next time? Gentler? What did he think this was? Some playful banter between lovers? It was nothing like that. The sheer absurdity, layered with fresh humiliation, snapped her resolve.

"Who wants a next time with you? Who wants your promise to be gentler?" she shouted, yanking.her wrist from his now-loosened grip and shoving him away with all the strength she had.

Frantically, she fixed her disheveled pajamas and wrapped it tightly around herself."Ifyou're not going to let me go, then get out. I don't want to see you."

Vincent staggered back a step. Watching her wrap herself so tightly, the frustration inside him swelled,fierce and suffocating. He forced a long breath, tamping it down."No need to get worked up. I have something for you." His tone slid back into its icy calm.

"I don't want anything from you. Unless it's freedom," Hannah shot back, her gaze hard as steel.
"That's the second time today." Vincent's eyes narrowed, a shadow of menace sliding into his voice."Don't ever mention freedom again. I don't like it."

"Well, I don't like anything you give me either!" Hannah retorted, meeting his gaze head-on, her voice sharp with defiance.

"Is that so? We'll see about that." A subtle sneer, dark and purposeful, appeared on Vincent's lips.
###Chapter 354 You Went Too Far


Vincent offered no reply. Instead, he lifted his hand and tapped the air twice with precision.

The heavy metal door slid open without a sound.

Two well-trained guards slipped in swviftly, hauling multiple advanced computers paired with matching accessories. Their actions were sharp and precise. In under a minute, the devices were arranged, linked to power, and synced to the network. Then, just as quietly, they slipped out and closed the door behind them.

Hannah froze at the sudden sight of the computers, utterly taken aback. Her brows drew tight, suspicion and bewilderment clouding her gaze. Her tone carried a razor edge. "What's this supposed to mean,Vincent? You planning to work from here? Watching me around the clock?"

She assumed it was yet another form of Vincent exerting domination.

Vincent moved toward a laptop, his slender fingers moving swiftly across the keyboard. The screen lit up,revealing the login interface of Luminara Group's encrypted internal system.

His stare pierced directly into hers. "Who said it's for me? It's for you: You have talent. Brains. Rotting away in this room forever is a total waste. There are piles of documents and pressing projects at Luminara Group awaiting your analysis. Now you can handle them-remotely."

Hannah's chest gave a startled jolt. He'd thought of everything-even her work. So this was why he'd promised she could have anything within these walls.

She rose slowly, tracing her fingers along the edge of the computer. Vincent really was methodical.Calculated. Thorough.

Her head lifted suddenly, emotions flickering in her eyes. "You know perfectly well what I'm capable of. And yet you still cage me in here..." Her words trembled beneath biting sarcasm. A hollow laugh slipped out."Isn't it ridiculous?"

The air stiffened. Only the soft whirl of cooling fans lingered.
Vincent studied the storm churning behind her eyes. He held back, saying nothing for several seconds,Finally, he spoke, voice heavy, cold, and edged with certainty. "Listen carefully. You can work. But you are not to reach out to anyone. You are not to send a single distress signal. If I catch the slightest attempt-"

He advanced, his imposing height pressing down with force, eyes cutting with warning and control. "I'll cut off every connection. You'll be barred from the outside entirely. And I won't deliver one word about Luminara Group again."

Then, he turned, striding out without a backward glance.

The steel door sealed with a sharp click.

Now, only Hannah remained, surrounded by the glow of faint blue light spilling from the machines. What was that supposed to be? A threat? Her spirit hardened. She would never bend. Any moment to break free-she would claim it.

She neared one of the computers and took a seat. Her hand pressed the power key with unshaken resolve.

The monitor bloomed, showing the insignia of Luminara Group, awash in pale blue glow.

···
Meanwhile, inside the Jones residence, Sharon pressed her chest, her face pale as chalk. It was obvious the news articles Erica revealed had struck her deeply.

The online space swarmed with explosive lines like,"Jones Group CEO Hijacks Wedding, Seizes Bride Before the Crowd."

Danica's expression was stormy, lips drawn taut. Barely containing fury, she snapped, "Sharon, we have to drag Vincent back immediately. He must face us. If he wants theatrics, fine-but not this! What possessed him to snatch a bride in public? What humiliation does that bring on us?"

Erica hastily added, voice anxious,"Exactly! Vincent has gone too far. All this-for Hannah? He's gambled recklessly-our standing, the firm's reputation, everything! The media's ablaze. Shares are already taking the hit."
Sharon drew several ragged breaths, her trembling hand pointing at the screen. "Call him. At once. Tell him to come home-without delay!"

Danica balked at being the one to confront Vincent. Tension between them was already stretched thin.

Seeing her reluctance, Erica seized the phone and dialed. After repeated tries, Vincent finally answered.

The moment the line connected, Erica cut straight to the point. "Vincent, you have to return.Your grandmother has fallen ill from the stress your actions have caused."

His tone carried through, low and glacial. "Put her on the line."

Erica passed the device to Sharon.

Sharon's voice quivered, breath uneven. "Vincent, what possessed you? You went too far."

His reply flowed deep, calm,yet commanding. "Forgive me for causing you distress, Grandma. The stories-and every related trace-are already erased. Give it five minutes, and there won't be a single search result left. Any outlet daring to repost or fuel new gossip will be shut down completely. They're worthless clowns.Don't waste your strength on them."

His words carried merciless authority, overflowing with confidence, the sort of power that didn't require pretenses.
###Chapter 355 Why Did You Have To Tear Them Apart


Erica heard every word with piercing clarity. Vincent had erased every single report and related trace! She had poured out money, pulled every string she could, and unleashed an army of bots. All of it, just to fan the flames of scandal, to drive Vincent back to the Jones family estate, to bury him beneath the family pressure.And in the span of five minutes, he had torn it all down. Her fortune and effort-wasted, scattered like as in the wind.

Erica's fists clenched so tightly that her nails dug into her palms. She forced herself to breathe evenly,to hold on to the last thread of composure.

After hearing what Vincent had said, Sharon wasn't worried about people gossiping. She knew better than anyone the weight the Jones Group carried.

"Vincent, how's Hannah?" Sharon's voice rasped with urgency, the weariness of age woven through every syllable.

That was where Sharon's concern truly lay. Hannah's parents had been in a horrific car accident-her father had not survived, and her mother was still recovering. And now, Hannah had been dragged from her own wedding in front of countless eyes. How could she possibly endure all this?

On the other end, Vincent's voice came steady, low, unshaken. "Don't be concerned, Grandma.She is doing well."

But Sharon did not believe him. A heavy sigh escaped her lips, her tone weighed down with frustration and aching persuasion. "Vincent, Hannah has been through a lot recently. Her father just passed away, and she was finally ready to rebuild, to lean on someone. Why did you have to snatch her from her soon-to-be groom? She'll only grow to hate your guts for this."

Vincent's grip on the phone tightened, knuckles whitening. After a long pause, his voice dropped lower,resolute and heavy. "So be it. Let her hate me. All I want is for her to stay by my side."

"This is torment-for both of you!" Sharon saw it wih frightening clarity. If he continued this path, only
anguish awaited him and Hannah.

"Since I forced this, I'Il shoulder the punishment that follows." Vincent's words fell sharp, like a vow sealed in iron. Then, in a tone buried deep with barely restrained possession, he added,"Grandma, I cannot stand by and watch her become another man's wife."

Silence stretched across the line.

In the end, Sharon released only a deep, weary sigh. She said no more. She knew-there was no changing his mind. Vincent had always been unyielding. Once his will locked onto something, there was no prying him loose. But Hannah... Poor Hannah...

And then, Erica's voice tore through the stillness, sharp, high, and quivering with emotion."Vincent! You're not actually planning to remarry Hannah, are you?"

A brief silence followed, heavy as stone. Then, Vincent answered without the slightest hesitation,"Yes."

One word. That was all it took to shatter the last glimmer of hope Erica clung to. "What about me?" Her voice broke into a scream, hysterical, raw with years of desperation. Tears streamed unchecked, her heart splitting open. "I've waited for you all these years! I've loved you for so long-why can't you see me?"

But Vincent's reply came like a blade of ice, merciless and cutting."Drop it, Erica. Don't think I'm blind to what you've done."

Erica went rigid, her blood freezing. He was onto her doings? The car crash. The murder attempt. Every scheme she had crafted with such care, believing them flawless. He knew everything?

Vincent's voice came sharp as a whip, every syllable precise and unrelenting. "This media circus-the rumors, the slander-I'm keeping record. The only reason you're not facing consequences yet is because the time hasn't come."

Relief flickered briefly through Erica's tense body. So that was all he meant.

But Vincent gave her no chance to recover. His tone turned even colder, a frost-laced blade sliding against her throat. "And one more thing-the crash that killed Hannah's father and injured her mother is tied to you."He had already sent men to gather the proof.
Erica forced her breath steady. "Vincent, I admit I stirred the media storm because I love you, but | would never harm anyone. Don't accuse me of something so vile just because you refuse my feelings. That truly breaks me."

Vincent's silence was suffocating. Then, with a sharp click, the call ended.

Erica stood frozen, her complexion drained to the pallor of ash.

The living room sank into suffocating quiet.

Sharon and Danica exchanged unreadable glances, their eyes turning toward Erica with a weight she could not bear.

Meanwhile,at Luminara Group, a mountain of work kept Hannah firmly occupied.

Though confined, she had finally been given purpose. Her days fell into rigid order. She moved like a finely tuned machine, each action deliberate, stripped of emotion-except when documents crossed her desk.Only then did a spark flare in her eyes, the sharp, commanding glint of a CEO flickering back to life.

Every day,without fail,Vincent joined her for dinner.

Hannah never spoke first. Vincent rarely broke the silence either-yet his gaze lingered on her constantly,unwavering, unreadable.

There was but one exception. Each evening, Hannah asked about her mother's condition.

And every time, Vincent gave the same measured response. "Same as before." Or, "Stable."

But tonight, halfway through dinner, Hannah still didn't ask about her mother.

Vincent's brow shifted almost imperceptibly, the faintest twitch betraying unease. After a few seconds, he spoke, his voice low and steady. "Your mother's condition remains unchanged, but she's now able to get out of bed."

Hannah gave a soft nod, her expression unreadable. Then, after a long pause, she lifted her eyes to him and asked, "Got any wine?"
###Chapter 356 The Funeral


Vincent stiffened in surprise. Wine? Hannah rarely made requests of her own.

Without a word, Vincent lifted his hand in a subtle command toward the butler outside the door.

The butler immediately disappeared and then returned moments later with a tray bearing a bottle of vintage red and two crystal goblets. With practiced grace, he filled both glasses and set them before Vincent and Hannah.

Hannah, however, didn't lift hers. Her eyes lingered on the liquid, unfocused, as though her thoughts had drifted far away.

Seconds stretched, the silence so heavy that even the sound of their breathing felt amplified in the vast dining room.

Abruptly, her hand slid forward, fingers closing around the stem of her glass. Instead of bringing it to her lips, she rose slowly, her movements deliberate under Vincent's watchful, inscrutable stare. Step by step,she crossed to the gleaming marble near the floor-to-ceiling window, where the faint light pooled across the floor.

Bending slightly, she tilted her wrist. A dark stream of wine spilled out, trickling across the floor in a thin,crimson sheen.

She stayed in that bowed position, her voice quiet yet cutting through the silence with unsettling clarity."|f I've guessed the time right, my father should already be in the ground now."

Her gaze turned distant, empty, as if she were speaking to no one at all. "This glass...is for him."

The moment her words faded, the room collapsed into a suffocating hush, the kind of silence that felt as final as death itself.

Vincent's chest tightened as he watched Hannah's fragile yet unyielding silhouette.A heavy ache clawed at him, spreading like ice through his veins. Almost acting on instinct, he rose to his feet, his movements
tinged with an urgency he didn't even realize was there.

His hand closed around his untouched wineglass, and he crossed the room toward her. Standing at her side,he lifted the glass and tilted his wrist, ready to offer his own silent toast.

"Don't." Hannah whipped her head around, one hand snapping up like a blade to stop him.

A scornful smirk twisted her mouth, every syllable seething with disdain. "Save it. My father absolutely despised you. He wouldn't have wanted your toast."

The stem of Vincent's glass groaned under his tightening grip, the crystal on the verge of shattering. His gaze locked with Hannah's, yet not a single word would come.

At last, he eased the glass back onto the table. Without another glance in her direction, he turned on his heel and walked out in silence.

Hannah watched him leave until the door closed behind him. Her lips curved in a faint, almost mocking smile. She poured herself a glass of wine and tipped it back in one swift motion. The chilled wine slid down her throat, burning with a bitterness that outmatched fire.

The following morning,Vincent showed up at her suite at first light, dressed in a stark black suit that sharpened his already imposing presence.

Hannah didn't move from where she stood. She only held his gaze in silence, her expression unreadable.

He closed the distance between them and extended a hand, revealing a box wrapped with meticulous care.

Inside lay a set of black women's formal wear-tailored with elegant precision, somber and dignified.

"Put it on," he instructed, his tone quiet yet brooking no refusal.

Her eyes lingered on the outfit before drifting back to his face. If her instincts were right, he meant to take her to her father's grave. And that meant last night's little plan had succeeded.

Without pausing, she accepted the clothes and slipped into the bathroom.

Several minutes later, Hannah reemerged. She stopped before him, her posture straight, and gave a







印
restrained nod, "Thanks."

Vincent's gaze lingered on her, heavy and unreadable. "You know where I'm taking you?"

" guessed as much," she answered evenly. "I couldn't be there for the funeral, but at the very least, I can stand at his grave."

Vincent offered no reply. He pivoted on his heel instead."Let′Sgo."

The car soon hummed along the road in steady silence.

Hannah offered no words, her face angled toward the window, her gaze unfocused on the scenery rushing by.

Having endured the long drive, the car finally rolled into the quiet heart of the cemetery.

Hannah's eyes caught sight of the crowd first-rows of mourners dressed in black, their solemn faces turned toward a casket at the front. A funeral was underway.

Her breath hitched. Today? Her father was being laid to rest today? Disbelief and shock clouded her gaze,the weight of it striking her chest like a blow.

Vincent had brought her here just in time-just in time for her father's funeral, justin time to say goodbye.

Hannah instantly pushed the car door open and hurried out, her steps unsteady but urgent. Every instinct pulled her toward the center, toward her father's casket.

But a firm hand clamped down on her wrist. She spun, startled, only to find Vincent's piercing eyes fixed on her, his grip unyielding. His voice was low, edged with warning. "You'll stay at the back. Don't move forward."

"That's my father!" Hannah's voice cracked, grief and fury spilling through her trembling words. "You won't even let me walk up there and say goodbye?"

Vincent's grip clamped down like iron, his hold unyielding. His gaze cut through her, cold and commanding."I said-you stay back."
Hannah's lips parted, but no words came at first. Finally, in a voice edged with despair, she said, "Then you shouldn't have brought me here at all."

The anguish in her gaze cut straight through Vincent's armor. His chest tightened, a painful throb he couldn't ignore. He looked at her trembling frame, sorrow making her shoulders shake. Almost instinctively,his grip slackened, his fingers loosening ever so slightly around her wrist.

Vincent knew Claude's men must be lurking in the shadows, waiting for the slightest slip to snatch Hannah away from him. Just bringing her here already pushed the limits of recklessness. The smart mnove was to keep her tightly restrained in the back, ensuring no one could reach her. Logic demanded it. Yet, denying her felt cruel.

In the end, he loosened his hold. He conceded. "Fine. Go ahead."

He consoled himself that the situation was under his control. What was there to fear? If things came to it,he'd tear her away from Claude again-no matter the cost.
###Chapter 357 She Tried To Escape Again


Hannah moved with aching slowness toward her mother, Margaret, the woman she had ached to see for so long.
The moment Hannah reached her mother's wheelchair, she dropped to her knees and wrapped her arms tightly around Margaret's frail frame, clinging as if she could keep her mother from slipping away again.

Margaret's eyes welled up as she fixed her gaze on Hannah. A raw cry of sorrow and relief tore from her lips,striking deep into Hannah's chest and unraveling her restraint.

"Anna.., Finally, I get to see you. I thought I'd never lay my eyes on you again," Margaret murmured, her trembling hand clutching hard at Hannah's sleeve.

"Mom, I'm here. I'm right here..." Hannah's voice cracked. She buried her face in Margaret's lap, pouring all her grief and despair into that long-yearned-for embrace.

Claude stepped quickly to their side, lowering himself into a crouch, his expression shifting with a storm of emotions as he watched Hannah clinging to the wheelchair. His voice came low and careful.·"Anna, did he let you come?"

Hannah drew a shaky breath, struggling to gather herself as she lifted her head. Her voice was quiet,almost fragile, when she answered, "Yes."

Her eyes drifted past Claude, settling on the coffin ahead and the priest waiting in solemn silence.

The priest remained solemn, waiting quietly for the rite to continue.

Hannah turned her head toward Claude, her voice hushed. "Claude,what's next?"

His eyes followed hers, his face settling into a heavy calm. "Only the last step remains. The family must cover the coffin with soil."

The casket was lowered into the earth, the final ritual calling for the closest family members to scatter soil
over it-a symbolic farewell.

Hannah drew herself upright and stepped toward the open grave. The priest gave a slight nod, granting her permission to proceed.

An attendant moved forward, presenting her with a deep brown wooden bowl brimming with soil.

Hannah's fingers trembled as she scooped up a fistful of soil. Drawing in a shaky breath, she let the earth fall in a slow cascade across her father's coffin. "Dad..." Her voice slipped out in a hush, meant for her own ears. "I came to say goodbye. Rest easy now..."

A few steps away, Vincent stood unmoving beneath a black umbrella, his tall figure casting a sharp silhouette against the mourners. His gaze, cold and unblinking, never wavered from Hannah.

When the coffin descended inch by inch, the crowd lowered their heads in unison, a heavy silence cloaking the cemetery.

Vincent hesitated briefly before bowing deeply, his expression unreadable yet reverent.

The funeral ceremony concluded.

Low murmurs drifted as people slowly dispersed into the gray afternoon.

Margaret clung desperately to Hannah's hand, her frail fingers locked tight as though terrified her daughter might vanish again.

"Anna, don't go... Please, don't leave me..." Margaret's frail voice wavered with desperation.
"Mom,don't fret. I'm not leaving you," Hannah murmured, clutching Margaret's cold hand tightly, her own voice choked with emotion. Now that she had broken free, she vowed never to be dragged back again.

Claude moved closer, a steady presence at their backs, his stance protective. "Anna, I'll take you away," he promised, his words quiet but firm.

Hannah's pulse quickened. She gripped the wheelchair handles and pushed Margaret toward the narrow side path that wound away from the main cemetery road. Leaning close, she whispered urgently to Claude,"Be careful!" Her gaze darted anxiously toward Vincent, a shadow of dread crossing her eyes.H′S
brought men with him."

Claude caught the worry glinting in her eyes, and the sight struck him like a blade. She was worried about him. A faint smile tugged at his lips. He lifted his hand, resting it lightly on Hannah's hand, which pushed Margaret's wheelchair. "Don't be afraid," he murmured.

His glare swept the men closing in, forged with resolve and unflinching. "No matter what happens today, I'll see you out of here safely."

Then, voice low but firm, he ordered, "Go!" His body angled protectively in front of her as she steered the wheelchair quickly toward the narrow side path leading to the temporary parking lot.

Hannah pressed her lips together and nodded, wordless, her pace quickening.

But just as the wheels picked up speed, Vincent's commanding voice rose above the hush of the crowd."Come back to me-don't make me say it again!"

Hannah stiffened but kept her grip steady on the wheelchair handles, refusing to falter. Every ounce of her strength went into pushing Margaret forward, desperate to break free.

Claude's eyes narrowed with a razor-sharp glint. He lifted his hand in a decisive command. From the crowd,men in tailored black suits appeared as if conjured-silent, disciplined, and deadly. In a heartbeat,they formed a living barricade, shielding Hannah and Margaret while cutting off Vincent's line of sight and pursuit.

Vincent froze in place, his dark gaze locked on Hannah's retreating figure. Fury churned in his chest-she was slipping away from him yet again. Why couldn't she just remain where she belonged-beside him?

"You think I'll let you steal her away like before, after everything that's happened?" Claude's voice thundered with iron resolve,his stance unyielding.

Vincent's lips twisted into a dangerous sneer across the human wall. "Go ahead. Try me."
###Chapter 358 Madness


Vincent spared no breath on words. With a sharp flick of his wrist, his bodyguards stormed in, surrounding the scene like a tightening net. A single silent command rippled through the air.

"Don't let them through!" Claude's voice cracked like a whip.

The two forces collided instantly-fists, shouts, and bodies crashing together in a surge of chaos. Cries rang out, echoing across the cemetery.

Unmoved by the uproar, Vincent forged ahead, his long strides cutting straight toward the narrow path where Hannah desperately pushed the wheelchair to safety.

Claude's eyes narrowed to slits. He shoved an attacker aside and lunged forward, blocking Vincent's path."Don't you take another damn step!"

But before he could close in, one of Vincent's elite guards slid into position. Claude was driven straight into combat.

Vincent's eyes burned with a relentless intensity, every step he took steady and unyielding.

The sky broke open, releasing a thin veil of rain that misted the path, turning the air damp and heavy.

Hannah clenched her jaw and forced the wheelchair forward, her arms straining as the wheels jolted over the uneven, mud-slick ground.

The wheelchair rattled violently, but she refused to glance behind her. Her focus was fixed ahead-just keep moving. Faster! She had to go faster.

But then, disaster struck. A jagged tree root caught the wheel with a sharp crack. The sudden stop pitched the chair forward in a violent lurch.

"Ah!" Margaret's terrified cry split the drizzle-drenched air. Her frail body pitched forward uncontrollably,helpless against the force.
Hannah's face drained of color as she instinctively lunged to catch Margaret. The force of the fall was too much-her hands only managed to clamp onto Margaret's arm before the momentum dragged her down to her knees.

Margaret's fragile leg struck a jagged rock, and the searing pain made her slip into unconsciousness instantly.

In a blind panic, Hannah fumbled to check her mother's condition, her trembling fingers hovering uselessly,afraid that touching the wrong place might hurt her mother more.

Then, a shadow fell across them. A tall, commanding figure loomed above-Vincent. He leaned down,his voice low and chillingly comnposed. "This is the second fucking time you've tried to escape!"

Hannah's grip on her mother's arm tightened desperately. Resistance would mean nothing here. Her only choice was to stall-to bargain-until Claude arrived.

Slowly, she lifted her face. The hatred that once burned in her eyes was gone, leaving only a hollow emptiness. Her voice broke into a lifeless surrender. "Vincent, I give in. I'll stay by your side,forever."

For a fleeting instant, Vincent's hardened mask cracked, and something unguarded stirred across his features. The storm in his eyes went still. "You won't try to run again?" His voice came rough,almost unsteady.

"I won't," Hannah answered in a quiet murmur.

His stare pinned her in place as he leaned closer, his tall frame casting a heavy shadow. "Do you really mean that?" he demanded firmly.

Her gaze didn't waver as she answered, "I've never once lied to you."

The words twisted inside him. His hand lifted on instinct, reaching for her cheek-then froze when he realized her eyes weren't on him at all. They were fixed on Claude.

Bitterness cut through him like a blade. A jagged laugh broke from his chest, and the hand meant to touch her curled slowly into a fist.
He suddenly closed the space between them, his breath hot and searing even through the chill of the rain,his voice dripping with rage at her lies. "I almost believed you!" His gaze cut into her like sharpened steel,merciless and unrelenting. "But all you're doing is buying time."
Straightening with icy composure, he delivered his words like a verdict. "Stop looking-your precious Claude won't be coming. Chances are, he's too broken to even stand." He deliberately uttered the last sentence.

"What the hell did you do to him?" Hannah's chest constricted, her voice sharp with panic. A torrent of regret and fury roared through her veins. Claude had taken that risk for her sake, and if she could choose,she would rather see him walk away unscathed.

"What happened to him?" she demanded again, her voice trembling.

Vincent snapped his head toward her, his eyes locking onto the raw concern shining in her expression-concern not for him, but for Cclaude. A brutal wave of jealousy and anguish crashed through him, threatening to swallow him whole.

He strodeforward in a single, brutal step, his hand clamping around her chin, forcing her head up until her eyes had nowhere else to look but at him. "So he means that much to you?"

The words rasped out of his throat, trembling with hurt and fury. "Not even a corner of your heart left for me? Why don't you even care if I bleed, if I break? All you see is Claude-always Claude. He's flawless in your eyes, isn't he?"

"Yes!" she screamed, throwing the truth at him without hesitation."At least he wouldn't lock me up like some deranged man!"

"Deranged?" Vincent let out a jagged laugh, one that cut like broken glass. His hold on her chin grew merciless, his stare unraveling into something wild, something dangerous.

"If madness was what you wanted to see.s." He bent close, his breath scorching against the cold curve of her ear, his voice dropping into a deep, savage growl. "Then I'd have already chained your ankles to the bedframe, made sure your eyes saw nothing but me from sunrise to dusk. Your world would shrink down to one thing, one person. Only me. That would be madness."
###Chapter 359 | Don't Parade My Woman As If She's A Prize


Hannah's frame quaked on its own accord. This wasn't the Vincent she remembered. The man who always seemed to have everything under control, whose fury never diminished his aura of invincibility-the head of the Jones Group-now felt utterly alien to her. Vincent appeared transformed, his stare frenzied, his aura disturbingly foreign. When had he shifted into this? Was she the cause? Was it worth it?

"Don't dare think of escaping from me again." Vincent's tone snapped her awareness back in place. "If it happens a third time, I might really do something crazy to you."

His hand moved,reaching to brush the rain from her cheeks.

But Hannah, alarmed, flinched her head aside, her body recoiling without thought.

That abrupt recoil struck Vincent like a jolt. His arm stalled mid-motion, his gaze sharpening into something darker,more threatening. "Are you afraid of me?"

"Yes," Hannah confessed, bewilderment filling her expression. "I feel like I don't even know you anymore."

Her voice sliced through him like a dull blade. She spoke the truth-he had never been like this. He had always been logical, assured, and in control of every detail. Yet, when it came to things involving Hannah,control always slipped away. It all started with their divorce. Afterward, she was surrounded by other exceptional men, forcing him to take notice. Her choice to wed Claude had driven him to the edge.

At the wedding, he'd finally realized he couldn't accept losing her. Therefore, he'd seized her and bound her to him.

And he didn't regret taking her away. He knew she hated him with every fiber of her being. Even if her hatred lasted a lifetime, as long as she stayed with him, as long as he was the only one she lay eyes on, it was sufficient.

Vincent brushed aside his turmoil, his stare hard and immovable, beraying nothing frail. He clutched Hannah's chilled wrist. "You're coming back with me."
"I can move myself!" Hannah resisted, shooting a desperate glance toward her mother in the wheelchair."My mom's still here!"

"I'll have her rushed to the hospital-the finest doctors!" Vincent barked, shooting a silent order at the advancing bodyguards with his eyes alone.

Just then, Claude rushed over, flanked by a few bodyguards. "Vincent, release her!"

Claude's brow was gashed, one eye nearly swollen shut, and his mouth torn and bleeding

Hannah saw Claude's battered state clearly, and a rush of self-reproach and alarm made her cry out,"Claude,are you hurt?"

Her heartfelt concern for another man pierced Vincent's heart. His grip on her wrist clamped harder,drawing a pained gasp from her lips.

"I'm fine!" Claude smeared the blood away. As he'd expected, she felt sorry for him.

Claude steadied himself, glaring at Vincent with a bold challenge. "Vincent! Do you dare face me one-on-one? The defeated man walks away from Hannah forever and never appears before her again."

Vincent's furious mask instantly shifted into mocking contempt. He didn't so much as twitch an eyebrow.His reply was cutting, frigid, and dismissive. "I don't parade my woman as if she's a prize." His tone carried iron, as if the world bent to his will. "And as for challenging me? You're not even qualified."

With that, Vincent ignored Claude's furious shouts, disregarded Hannah's thrashing, and hauled her toward his convoy without a backward glance.

"Vincent Jones! You coward!" Claude, livid at the raw disdain Vincent threw him, tried charging forward.

But Vincent's bodyguards barred his path once more. "Mr. Hobbes, please restrain yourself," one of them stated flatly.

"Move aside!" Claude lunged again, nearly frantic.

A violent clash erupted immediately. Claude was soon subdued by the trained bodyguards, left to watch helplessly as Vincent dragged Hannah away.
Shielded by the bodyguards, the convoy dlissolved into the downpour.

"Mr. Hobbes, should we pursue?" one of Claude's people asked anxiously.

Claude lifted his battered face, a faint, eerie smile touching his mouth. He raised a hand, ordering them to hold back. "No need."

Claude's grin deepened. His plan had succeeded-Hannah had witnessed exactly what he wanted her to witness.
###Chapter 360 Could You Love Me Again


Claude understood perfectly-there was no way he could take Hannah away this time. That was why he'd stepped forward deliberately,challenging Vincent head-on-he wanted Hannah to see it with her own eyes,to remember forever how much he was willing to bleed for her. Even as Vincent's men's blows rained down,he had kept fighting back, every strike carrying raw defiance and devotion. That was love-unyielding,reckless, and absolute, all there for her to see.

Vincent, on the other hand, had only pushed her further with his cruelty. The harsher he treated her now, the less chance she'd ever forgive him once she broke free.

Thus, in a way, Vincent was helping Claude, driving her heart further from Vincent.

So what if the wedding was interrupted? Claude never cared about pomp or ceremony. What he craved was Hannah's heart, wholly and irrevocably his. A Hannah Scott who would never look at Vincent Jones with anything but fear and loathing.

···
Meanwhile, Hannah was taken back into the confines of her suite

The massive steel door creaked open with a menacing weight.

Vincent shoved her inside, the force of it knocking her forward until her knees buckled and she.crashed onto the thick carpet.

He lingered at the threshold, rainwater dripping from his soaked shirt, the fabric clinging to every line of muscle. The tension radiating from him filled the room, heavy and suffocating.

With slow, deliberate movements, he undid the buttons of his shirt and advanced on her, each step landing like a warning.

Hannah scrambled upright, spine rigid as she locked eyes with him."What now? Going to force yourself on me again? Just like before?" Her voice trembled but carried defiance.
No reply came. His silence was sharper than any retort. Instead, his hand clamped around her arm, dragging her toward the shower adjoining the bedroom.

The sudden pull sent her stumbling into the frosted glass door. She barely caught herself, palms flat against the slick surface, breath shuddering.

Before she could gather her thoughts, the hiss of running water filled the space. A torrent of spray hit her,soaking her hair, her clothes, her skin.

Then, his shadow fell over her. He leaned in, lips crushing hers with raw, punishing force. It wasn't a kiss-it was an act of possession, primal and desperate, a storm breaking loose with no words left to give.

Vincent's mouth crashed against hers, a brutal claim rather than a kiss, water cascading down and sealing her in his suffocating hold. His force was relentless; every movement meant to brand her as his, as if declaring without words that she belonged to him-utterly, inescapably, without exception.

Her vision blurred behind the sheet of rushing water. She tried to wrench herself free, but he slammed her wrist flat against the slick tiles with effortless strength, pinning her like prey.

A muffled whimper slipped from her throat, trembling against his lips.

Vincent's other hand roamed, unyielding, its path refusing to stop. His hand, searing against her damp skin,slid over her waist with urgent pressure. Without stopping, it pressed into her private parts.

"Ah!" Hannah flinched, a shiver racing through her as her body reacted against her will.

He then lifted one of her legs and took her, pressing her firmly against the wall with unrelenting force.

The icy tiles bit into her fevered skin while steaming water poured down relentlessly from above.

The air grew thick with heat and panic. His touch was rough, his kiss unyielding, each move meant to overpower rather than soothe.

Shallow, ragged breaths tangled with her muffled sobs,filling the narrow space until it felt like the walls themselves were closing in.

The steam thickened around them until the world itself seemed to dissolve.
Time slipped away, unmeasured, before Vincent finally carried Hannah out of the shower.

He set her carefully on the bed, though her body turned instinctively away, eyes pressed shut in silent rejection.

Hovering close, his voice rasped with a raw edge. "Burn this into your head-don't you dare run again. Each time you try, I'll break that thought with punishment until the day you no longer dare."

With nothing more to say, he strode off without a backward glance.

The echo of his heavy steps trailed off beyond the door.

Hannah slowly opened her eyes. Of course, she would find a way to slip away again. Next time, she would run farther-far enough that his shadow could never catch her again.

···
The days that followed glided past in an eerie calm.

The only disruption came with her sudden period, a turn that unsettled Vincent and briefly derailed his cold determination to force her into motherhood.

That night, Hannah lay restless, her lower abdomen aching faintly while her mind spun through endless calculations.

In the hush of the darkened room, the door creaked open without a sound.
A tall silhouette slipped inside, every line of it achingly familiar. It was none other than Vincent. He didn't bother wvith the lights. Only the pale spill of moonlight guided him as he moved quietly toward the bed.

Hannah squeezed her eyes shut and slowed her breathing, feigning sleep. The weight of his stare pressed on her, lingering with unsettling patience.

Then, with a surprising softness, he tugged back the blanket's edge and eased down beside her.

Her entire body went rigid, bracing herself for what might come.

But the anticipated violation never followed. A calloused but strangely gentle hand settled over her belly,
radiating warmth through the thin fabric. Slow, deliberate circles pressed into her skin, awkward yet tender,nothing like the merciless man he had been before.

Hannah kept her eyes shut, acting as though she slept, while the steady rhythm of his palm lulled the edges of her fear.

In the hush of the room, time itself seemed to pause.

Just as her guard began to waver, his husky whisper brushed her ear. "Hannah, could you ever love me again?"

The words were almost swallowed by the dark, but to her, they struck sharper than any blade. And in that fragile, perilous instant, the outline of a perfect escape formed in her mind.
###Chapter 361 Her Plan Was In Motion


Hannah appeared to have finally surrendered to her captivity. Gone were the days of glaring at Vincent with hatred or hurling biting words his way.

Now, she rose promptly each morning, managed Luminara Group's affairs with meticulous care, and ate her three meals with clockwork precision.

At times, she even initiated polite, if shallow, exchanges with Vincent, carefully steering clear of anything too personal. Her once-fiery eyes, brimming with loathing, now carried a serene detachment, tinged with just enough compliance to seem genuine.

That evening, the dining room was quiet save for the soft clatter of silverware.

Hannah cut her steak with elegant precision. When she glanced up, her gaze settled calmly on the man across from her. Vincent looked utterly drained. The dark circles under his eyes were stark, and his plate sat nearly untouched.

Hannah concealed a faint smirk. She already knew the cause.

The servants' whispers painted a clear picture-Vincent toiled late into the night in his study, often forgoing sleep entirely. Sometimes, he slipped into her room. Occasionally, he merely lay beside her for a while.Other times, he perched on the edge of her bed, silently watching her until dawn. His appetite had withered.Coffee seemed to be his sole sustenance these days. Curiously, the only time he ate properly was during these shared dinners with her.

Hannah gazed at Vincent, her voice gentle, almost offhand. "Rough night's sleep?"

The question landed softly, like a leaf drifting onto a still pond. Vincent paused, his fork hovering midair, and met her gaze. Was that concern in her voice? It was the first time since her confinement that she'd shown any care for his well-being.

Hannah held his stare, her expression steady and composed, as if the question were merely a courteous
remark.

A faint spark stirred in his chest, an emotion he couldn't quite pin down. After a brief silence, he swallowed lightly,his voice low and rough. "I'm fine."

She didn't press further. The meal continued in quiet.

That night, Hannah heard the familiar creak of her bedroom door easing open. She kept her eyes closed,feigning sleep.

A long pause followed, so long that she wondered if he'd simply retreat.

At last, the mattress dipped with the weight of another body. Vincent had climbed into bed, but he stayed distant, leaving a space wide enough for a third person between them.

Hannah's breathing remained soft, steady, perfectly serene.

More time passed.

Then, ever so subtly, her body moved-a gentle, seemingly natural turn, as if shifting in slumber. Slow,unguarded. She rolled closer to his side. Her arm, as if by instinct, brushed lightly against his.

In the darkness, Vincent's entire frame tensed. His heart lurched with a sudden, fierce thud.

Then, so faint that it was almost in a dream, Hannah murmured, her lips barely parting, "Don't leave... I'm scared."

The words cut through Vincent's defenses like a blade. His rigid posture began to soften. Hesitantly, he raised an arm and gently drew her closer.

To his astonishment, she didn't resist. Instead, she nestled nearer, as if seeking refuge, her body curling into his embrace.Her cheek brushed softly against his chest, a fleeting yet intimate gesture.

For a moment, Vincent forgot how to breathe. Then, his heart roared back to life, pounding fiercely,uncontrollably. The feeling was foreign. Disarming. Irresistible.

The tension in his shoulders melted, giving way to a fragile calm. His eyes drifted shut. His breathing
slowed, deepened. After countless sleepless nights, he finally sank into true, unbroken sleep.

But then, Hannah's eyes snapped open. No trace of sleep clouded her sharp, clear gaze. Only a cold,subtle smile curved her lips. Her plan was in motion. She would bide her time, earning his trust bit by bit, until she held all she needed to break free for good.



Meanwhile, Claude had healed from his wounds. But now, not only was Hannah missing, so was Margaret.

Vincent's men had spirited Margaret away, hiding her beyond reach. Claude's exhaustive searches had yielded nothing.

A growing darkness shadowed Claude's eyes, fueled by mounting frustration.

A sharp knock sounded at the office door.

"Come in," Claude said curtly, not glancing up from his papers.

Owen stepped inside, his expression guarded. "Mr. Hobbes, a woman is here to see you."

Claude's pen froze mid-signature. A woman? Could it be Hannah? Had she escaped and sought him out? He rose swiftly, striding toward the door. "Who is it?"

"Miss Erica Stanton," Owen replied quickly.

Claude stopped dead. His face turned to stone. "Not interested. Turn her down." The name didn't even warrant a moment of his time.

But Owen added, "She claims to have à critical business proposal, one you can't dismiss. It concerns Miss Scott."
###Chapter 362 The Deal


"Let Miss Stanton in." Claude set his pen down, his expression composed yet keenly alert.

Owen nodded and stepped out, closing the door behind him.

Soon, the office door swung open, and Erica stepped inside. She approached the imposing desk, her smile a delicate balance of politeness and cunning."MMr. Hobbes. A privilege to meet you at last."

Claude's gaze lifted slowly, his eyes glinting with unveiled contempt. "Adopted daughter of the Jones family.Vincent's aunt in name alone." His voice sharpened, cutting like a blade. "You have no standing here, let alone a deal worth my time."

Erica's smile wavered briefly but held firm. Undeterred, she leaned forward, planting both hands on the desk's cold surface, her eyes locking onto his with defiance. "You took this meeting, Mr. Hobbes. That tells me you know I have something you need. Am I mistaken?"

Claude didn't retort. He eased back in his chair, fingers laced with calculated calm across his lap. "Speak.What kind of deal are you offering?"

Erica drew a steadying breath, her gaze alight with fierce determination."|t′Ss straightforward. We combine forces-to free Hannah from Vincent's grasp."

A cold,derisive smirk curved Claude's lips. "I don't need your help to rescue her."

"But you've already failed once," she shot back, her tone smooth yet edged with triumph. "At the funeral,wasn't it? You underestimated him. The moment he realizes Hannah's gone, he'll tear the world apart to find her."

Claude's eyes darkened, a shadow crossing his features.

Erica had been at that funeral, initially just to witness the chaos. Instead, she'd seen Vincent-wild,unraveling, consumed by his desperation for Hannah. He loved Hannah. Fiercely. Obsessively.
And Erica's hatred for Hannah had only deepened since. Worse, Vincent had begun prying into her secrets.
Exposure loomed, which was precisely why she stood here now, wagering everything on a perilous gambit."| can ensure Vincent stops pursuing her," she declared, her voice taut with a blend of desperation and
conviction.

Claude's eyes narrowed. The claim was ludicrous. To make Vincent give up on Hannah? Impossible.Unless...

He studied her closely, his voice low and probing. "You've gone to all this effort-for what? Out of kindness?"

She straightened, her gaze blazing. "Of course not. I want Vincent. He should have been mine from the start."

She exhaled, her voice taking on a chilling yearning. "I'll undergo plastic surgery to become Hannah's mirror image. I'll mimic her movements, her speech, her very smile. I'll become Hannah, and I'll take her place." Her smile stretched, unhinged yet resolute. "He'll cage me. Claim me. Love me-believing I'm her. And you? You and the real Hannah can be together, with no one to interfere."

In her warped reasoning, her plan was flawless. She would have Vincent, even i it meant wearing a stolen face and name. His blunt rejection over the phone had made it clear-he would never love her as she was.But as Hannah Scott? He would. It was a solid deal. More crucially, a new identity would let her slip the law's grasp, leaving her past sins behind.

Claude had suspected something this twisted, but hearing it aloud still sent a chill through him.

The office sank into a heavy, stifling silence. Only Erica's slightly quickened breaths, tinged with agitation,broke the stillness.

Claude regarded the woman before him-this utterly unhinged woman. Intriguing. It was, undeniably, a brilliant plan. He had to concede, in some ways, they were disturbingly alike.

A low chuckle escaped him before he extended a hand toward her.′′Apleasure to work with you."

Erica didn't hesitate. She clasped his hand firmly. "The pleasure's mine."
Their handshake was brief. A fleeting contact, and then nothing.



Within the seclude suite, Vincent stirred, his eyes fluttering open as the realization hit-he had fallen asleep in Hannah's room, in her bed. And not just that. He had slept deeply, undisturbed.

Across the room, Hannah was already awake, moving gracefully in the small kitchenette attached to the suite.

He turned his head, his gaze lingering on her.

Sensing his attention, she spoke without looking back. "You're up? Want to rest a bit longer?"

Vincent's lips parted, an instinct to explain rising-that he hadn't meant to drift off beside her. He'd only wanted to ensure she was still there. He hadn't planned to stay, much less sleep beside her. But the words stayed trapped in his throat. What was there to justify? She was his. Her bed, her room, her very being...all belonged to him. His presence here was rightfully so.

He masked the flicker of emotion in his eyes, slipping back into his usual composure. "What are you doing?"he asked, his gaze sweeping over her.

Without turning, her hands still busy, Hannah replied, "I asked the staff for some ingredients. I'm making something.A soup."

His brows furrowed slightly. "The staff can handle cooking. You don't need to bother."

Her hands kept moving, but she glanced over her shoulder, meeting his eyes briefly. "But you haven't been eating properly,have you?"
###Chapter 363 Like An Ordinary Married Couple


A jolt of warmth coursed through Vincent's chest, subtle yet undeniable. Hannah was cooking for him?Because she'd noticed he hadn't been eating well? He watched her in silence, his gaze unwavering.

When he didn't respond, Hannah gestured toward a basket brimming with vibrant tomatoes and crisp asparagus, her tone light and effortless. "Don't just stand there-rinse those."

Vincent blinked, caught off guard. The formidable head of the Jones Group, a man who could shift markets with a single call, was being asked to wash vegetables. It was ludicrous.

Yet, as he observed her graceful movements in the kitchenette, enveloped in a rare,tranquil calm,he found himself stepping forward without protest. He rolled up his sleeves, exposing toned forearms, and began rinsing the produce under the faucet, his motions tentative but precise.

The gentle rush of water, the steady rhythm of chopping, the occasional clatter of a pan filled the air-no words were exchanged.

But the space hummed with the aroma of fresh ingredients and something far more elusive-the fleeting illusion of a home.

The meal came together quickly: three simple dishes and a soup.

They sat at the table, eating in companionable silence.

Unlike before, the quiet wasn't laced with tension or frost. No piercing glares, no sharp words. Just the soft clink of cutlery and the faint sounds of their meal.

To Vincent, this unassuming, home-cooked spread outshone any Michelin-starred feast. His stomach warmed. And for the first time in what felt like an eternity, so did his heart. For a fleeting moment, they felt like an ordinary married couple. The thought jolted him. His fingers stilled briefly around his fork.
In the days that followed, that feeling became a quiet obsession. He began to anticipate lunch with an unfamiliar eagerness. Each day at noon, his butler would appear at his office door, carrying a thermal food
box. "Mr. Jones, this is from Mrs. Jones."

Inside, Vincent would find a carefully crafted meal-warm, balanced, and tailored precisely to his tastes.He even suspected she was studying his preferences, subtly refining dishes based on what he seemed to enjoy the day before, presenting them with delicate precision the next.

He noted that she had changed. Was she really this softer and more attentive? Not quite. Her words remained sparse, her gaze never fully softened. A faint detachment lingered behind her composed exterior.But it was this understated care, this quiet dedication, that drew him in irresistibly.

That evening, they sat across from each other at the table, sharing another meal Hannah had prepared herself.

The atmosphere was serene, even comforting.

Vincent set down his fork and dabbed his mouth with a napkin. His gaze settled on her, deep and unreadable. "Starting tomorrow, you'll cook in the kitchen."

Hannah's hand froze, her fork suspended over her plate. She looked up, confusion flickering in her eyes."I've been cooking in the kitchen..." she said softly, referring to the suite's kitchenette.

Vincent clarified, "I mean the main kitchen."

The main kitchen. Her heart gave a single, heavy thud. That meant leaving the confines of the suite and moving freely through the house.

Her fingers tightened àlmost imperceptibly around her fork. She frowned slightly, a wry smile tugging at her lips. "You're really letting me out of this room?"

Vincent caught the subtle shift in her expression, and a quiet tension gripped his chest. He looked away,choosing his words with care. "Think of it as gratitude," he said, "for the meals you've made these past few days."

He paused and then added quietly,"My appetite's been better lately."

A glint of cold triumph flashed in Hannah's eyes. He was falling for it. She tilted her chin, her lips curving
into a carefully measured smile, laced with just the right hint of playful charm. "Well, naturally! I know how particular you are about food. That's why I've been mixing things up, just for you."

Seeing this rare, lively spark in her-the quiet pride, the flicker in her gaze-Vincent felt his lingering unease ease,if only slightly. "Thank you," he murmured.

Hannah seemed to catch herself, her expression slipping back into neutrality. She lowered her gaze,prodding her food with her fork, her tone tinged with feigned awkwardness. "I-I didn't do it for you," she muttered. "I have to eat too. Steak every night was getting old."

He didn't challenge her. A faint smile tugged at his lips, impossible to restrain.

They spoke no more after that.

Later that night, long after dinner had ended and the house had fallen silent, Vincent slipped into Hannah's room once more,the door opening soundlessly.

He approached her bedside. She lay still, her breathing even and calm, as if lost in deep slumber.

He stood there, simply watching. She seemed so at peace now, as if she'd truly settled into this life. Cooking for him, showing flashes of spirit, even hints of care-it all wove a picture that felt achingly real. Too perfect to be surreal.

Yet, just as he began to believe she would stay by his side, when he dared to lower his guard, a familiar dread crept in. A quiet fear that it was all a facade. That she would still disappear.

He lingered there for a long, long time. Finally, he turned, preparing to slip away as he always did.

But just as he moved, Hannah's hand darted out, her fingers closing gently around his wrist.
###Chapter 364 Living In The Same Room
Vincent went rigid, his entire frame taut as he spun around abruptly.

Hannah had already "woken up." Her lashes lifted just enough for a sliver of her gaze to catch him through the dim light,"drowsy" yet edged with faint irritation. A tiny furrow creased her brow as she muttered, her voice low and hoarse with sleep,"How long are you planning to hover there? Are you lying down or not?"

The words were muffled, almost swallowed by her exhaustion,but the tone carried a domestic sort of scolding-familiar,unguarded, and strangely intimate.

"Did I disturb you?" he inquired, his voice slipping into an unsteady murmur.

"Yeah. Just woke me up," she mumbled, vague and unfocused.Yet, her fingers stayed curled around his wrist, refusing to release him. Instead, she tugged lightly, coaxing him toward the bed with sleepy insistence.

"| will take my leave," he remarked, giving her hand the slightest resistance-half an excuse, half a test of whether she'd actualy let him go.

"Don't go." Her voice was still low and lazy, but it rooted him in place more effectively than her hand ever could. She tugged the blanket aside and shifted over, leaving just enough room for him. "Just sleep here." The words struck him like a blow. Was that really an invitation to her bed? A rush of euphoria tore through him, scattering every last shred of hesitation, fear, or doubt. He had to fight to last shred of hesitation, fear, or doubt. He had to fight to keep his face neutral, to smother the raw excitement threatening to spill out

He had braced himself for rejection-for her to turn away as she always did, to pretend he wasn't there, to meet his presence with that familiar wall of cold indifference. Yet, she hadn't. She had reached out to him, asking him to stay by her side. Wasn't it a sign? That some part of her walls was softening? That perhaps she didn't despise him with the same absolute force anymore? Maybe-just maybe-she was starting,inch by inch, to accept him.

He didn't pause for a second thought. Sliding beneath the blanket, he settled beside her, the cocoon of shared warmth drawing him in-the faint fragrance of her skin, the steady heat of his own body. It felt disarmingly natural, as if the space had always been meant for him.

Hannah kept her back turned, her posture cool, almost dismissive, as though letting him stay carried no weight at all-mere convenience, nothing more.

Her low voice drifted through the quiet, but the meaning hit him with striking sharpness. "Enough with creeping in at night-you disturb my sleep every time. If you're going to sleep here, then come earlier. It makes things better for us both. Got it?"

"Alright," he murmured, his voice rough, the single word overflowing with emotions he couldn't contain-relief, aching devotion, quiet joy.

He had ached for this-for the chance to share a night like this -for longer than he could remember. At last, he let his eyes fall shut. After what felt like eternity, every fiber of tension in him gave way. The gnawing restlessness, the constant unease,the sharp edge of panic-all gave way to a strange, steady calm.With her quiet breathing beside him, sleep drifted over him like a tide. Yet, in the darkness, unseen by him, Hannah kept her eyes wide awake. This was the seed of trust. And from that seed,freedom could finally grow.

...
From that night onward, Hannah and Vincent truly shared the same suite.

By day, she devoted herself to the affairs of Luminara Group.Every so often, she would call Vincent with a question-always framed around some complicated acquisition or a deliberately tangled financial model. Even when buried in his own work, he would set everything aside to untangle her supposed dilemmas.

Of course, those questions of hers were rarely genuine. They were excuses, carefully spun threads meant only to draw him in.

One day, she called him and murmured into the phone,"Vincent, I'm not too certain about how the tax structure works for this acquisition."

Almost at once, he silenced his executives with a raised hand,paused the video conference, and answered in that steady,low timbre of his, "Send the file over. I'll go through it."

Interruptions never bothered Vincent. If anything, they gratified him; her reliance made him feel indispensable. His team could only sit there in silence, forced to wait while their boss quietly took a call he would never explain.

At dawn one morning, Vincent stood before the mirror, already dressed in crisp slacks and a pressed shirt, fastening his cufflinks with practiced ease. Hannah padded over, still heavy with sleep, a navy-blue tie dangling from her hand.

"Lower your head," she murmured, her words roughened by lingering sleep.

He stilled for the briefest moment before complying without a He stilled for the briefest moment before complying without a word.

She slipped the tie around his collar, her fingers deft and deliberate, the motions smooth as though she'd done it countless times.

The nearness unsettled him. A man accustomed to control, to keeping others at a distance, now found himself disarmed by her simple act. Her fragrance brushed against his senses, faint yet intoxicating, and his breath faltered in his chest.

"Let me handle it," he muttered, retreating half a step as if to regain ground.

Yet, Hannah's hands never faltered. With one deft tug, she tightened the knot and smoothed the tie flat. "There. Perfect."

The ease between them carried a strange weight, as though this routine had been etched into their lives long ago.

She leaned in, eyes narrowing in playful scrutiny. "So tell me,what had you looking so jittery just now?"

Vincent gave no reply. A low, rough "I'm heading out" slipped from his lips as he turned away, the faintest smile tugging at his mouth despite himself.

Later that afternoon, the boardroom lights bore down on him during an emergency meeting. Barely ten minutes passed before his gaze drifted to the clock again and again.

Picking up on it, one of the senior directors called out, "Mr.Jones? Concerning our risk exposure in the Southern Peninsula,do you have any objections?"

Vincent lifted a hand, cutting the director off before the latter could go further. "I've already got the core risk points. Proceed exactly as outlined in Contingency Plan C. Lock down the specifics on your side and put a report on my desk by ten tomorrow." The words came clipped and final, shutting down any attempt
at follow-up.

While Vincent rose, swept his files into his briefcase, and strode to the door, another executive looked up, puzzled."Heading out in a hurry, Mr. Jones?"

Vincent kept moving, not breaking stride. "Yep." Hannah was waiting for his return.

But just then, a message from his bodyguard buzzed through.
###Chapter 365 Just family

The bodyguards had uncovered damning evidence against Erica and delivered it to Vincent.

After dinner, Vincent looked at Hannah, his voice steady and composed. "The bodyguards found evidence on Erica."

Hannah paused and then lifted her gaze. "Is it about my parents' car crash?"

Vincent nodded, his tone low and grave. "Yes. She paid off the driver and orchestrated it to look like a DUI. The targets were unmistakable."

Hannah slowly set her knife and fork down. A heavy silence hung between them for a few seconds before she spoke, her voice carefully neutral. "I suspected her involvement. But to think she was the one who actually had my parents killed..."

Vincent studied her-calm on the surface, but a storm raging beneath. Sympathy and anguish surged within him. All he could muster was: "I'm sorry for your loss."

His words carried the weight of mixed feelings.

Hannah met his gaze, her eyes resolute. "She may be your family, but I won't let her escape justice."

Without hesitation, Vincent nodded. "I've already handed everything over to the police. She'll face the consequences."

Hannah gave a slight nod, but her brows furrowed as a thought struck her. Her voice held a trace of skepticism. "Vincent, you and Erica... Is it really just family between you?"

Her tone was light, almost curious, but her eyes probed deeply."She despises me-enough to risk prison, enough to murder my She despises me-enough to risk prison, enough to murder my parents. That doesn't feel like something driven by familial loyalty."

Vincent held her steady gaze, a flicker of conflict passing over his face. He hesitated for only a moment before admitting, his voice low and firm, "She's been smitten with me. For years."

Hannah's expression shifted in an instant. Realization dawned,followed by a cold, sharp smile. "Of course," she said softly."That explains everything."

No wonder Erica had gone to such ruthless lengths to target her. The true motive behind it all was Vincent. A bitter thought emerged-had the past accusations, the sabotage, the threats ...all been Erica's doing as well?

Vincent saw the ice settle in Hannah's eyes. His chest tightened.He opened his mouth, eager to clarify-that he had never, not for a moment, reciprocated Erica's feelings.

But just then, his phone buzzed on the table, the screen illuminating with a new message.

He glanced down. It was from Erica. "Tomorrow, 11 a.m.-Warehouse 3, Westside Industrial Grounds. I'll tell you everything."

"What is it?" Hannah asked, her voice striking a perfect balance of concern and curiosity. She hadn't seen the screen clearly,but the sender's name-Erica-was unmistakable.

Vincent looked up and answered plainly, "Erica wants to meet.Says she has something important to tell me."

Hannah fell silent for a moment and then reached across the table, her hand closing firmly over his, her voice unwavering."Let me tag along."

"No," he replied instantly, the refusal automatic. It wasn't just a denial-it was instinct. He couldn't bear the thought of her
a denial-it was instinct. He couldn't bear the thought of her leaving the safety of this place, not for anything.

"Why not?" she countered, her voice rising with a hint of hurt."She orchestrated the crash that killed my father,Vincent. And now what-what else is she scheming? I deserve to know the truth."

Vincent's jaw tightened. He could see the pain blazing in her eyes.

But then her tone softened, still resolute but tinged with vulnerability. "I won't run," she said quietly. "Vincent,please-just trust me. Let me come with you."

Her hand remained on his, and he didn't pull away. He studied her face for a long moment, his lips pressed into a taut line.

Finally, under the weight of her gaze, he gave a small nod. "I'll take you."

A fleeting smile crossed Hannah's lips as she squeezed his hand gently. "Thank you."

Vincent didn't respond-just held her gaze, a question stirring in his mind. Would she really not run away from him again?



The next morning, Hannah and Vincent arrived at Westside Industrial Grounds precisely on time.

From the shadows of Warehouse 3, a figure emerged slowly.

It was Erica. Her eyes locked onto Hannah, and a sharp, bitter laugh escaped her.

"You brought her?" she sneered. "What's this? Wanting her to witness how completely you've discarded me? Or perhaps just letting her revel in my downfall?"

Vincent didn't take the bait. His expression remained impassive Vincent didn't take the bait. His expression remained impassive,but he stepped forward just enough to position himself protectively in front of Hannah.

Hannah, however, had no intention of staying in anyone's shadow. She stepped out from behind Vincent, meeting Erica's venomous stare with unwavering calm."Of course,he brought me," she said evenly. "You andI have unsettled matters."
###Chapter 366 She Confessed To All Of It
"Unsettled matters?" Erica laughed, the sound exaggerated and grating, as if she had just heard the most absurd thing in the world. Her laughter echoed through the empty warehouse,laced with a chilling madness. "Yeah, it's time to settle the score!"

The laughter cut off abruptly, her eyes narrowing with venom."Hannah Scott! You caused your parents' misfortune! Your father would have been alive, and your mother wouldn't have been injured if you hadn't been clinging to Vincent following your divorce! You are to blame for their incident!"

"Shut up!" Hannah snapped, lunging forward.

A sharp crack split the air as Hannah's palm struck. She had poured every ounce of strength into that slap, sending Erica staggering back a step, stunned by the blow.

Hannah seized Erica by the collar, dragging Erica close, her eyes blazing with fury. "What did my parents ever do to deserve this? If you've got a problem, take it out on me! Why go after them?"

Erica's head turned from the strike, but instead of fear, he lips curved into a sinister smile. "Take it out on you? No way! I want to watch you lose everything... To see you fall apart, sink into despair, even wish you were dead! That's what I want!"

"Enough!" Vincent's cold voice sliced through the chaos. He stepped forward, his presence commanding and sharp. "What exactly are you trying to say?"

His patience had reached its limit. All he wanted was to end this conversation and get Hannah out of this nightmare Erica flinched under Vincent's icy stare, but then her eyes glowed with an even crazier intensity. A frightful smile contorted her face as she spun back to Hannah. "What am I trying to say? Hannah, I'm telling you... That fire in your store that burned you alive? I had someone set it. Those three unreasonable women who ruined your new store's opening?I hired them. The man-nurse who attempted to force you off the roof to pretend to fake a suicide? That was me in disguise."

With each confession, her smile widened, her tone growing more disturbingly cheerful. "Oh, and your car crash, the one that left nothing but a scorched frame? The hitman inside?|paid him fifty million to take you out."

She gave a little shrug, her voice dripping with malice."What a pity... You survived. Otherwise, none of this would have happened. Now, how does it feel? Startled?"

Hannah hadn't seen it coming. Her fists clenched tight, her voice cutting cold. "So you've been after me all along."

Vincent's expression darkened, reaizing how many times Erica had come terrifyingly close to killing Hannah.

"That's right!" Erica admitted, her grin stretching with glee. "I came back because Brinley, that fool, landed in prison, and you and Vincent were divorced! I thought it was finally my turn to stand by his side. But you just kept lingering, always hovering around him! I couldn't take it-I hated you!" Her voice rose with raw spite.

"Very well," Hannah said, forcing her tone steady, "you'll be hating me from a prison cell for the rest of your life." She pulled out a small recorder hidden in her sleeve. Every one of Erica's confessions had been captured word for word.

The manic grin on Erica's face only widened as her gaze locked onto the recorder. "Well-prepared, aren't you? But do you think I care? | confessed because | don't intend to deny!" Suddenly, the sharp wail of police sirens cut through the air outside. The authorities had arrived.

Erica didn't turn. She fixed her gaze on Vincent. "Vincent,I just want you to know, I have no regrets, and I love you."

In a flash, she whipped out a metal lighter and clamped onto Hannah's wrist.

Vincent's eyes widened in alarm. Erica intended to take Hannah down with her!
###Chapter 367 Testing

A surge of dread ripped through Vincent. "Get down!" he barked, his voice raw with urgency as he hurled himself toward Hannah, every muscle straining

Just before his arms could close around Hannah, Erica acted in a way no one foresaw.

Instead of dragging Hannah into disaster with her, Erica gave a fierce shove, flinging Hannah forward-straight into Vincent's chest.

The impact knocked the air out of Hannah as she stumbled into him,startled and unready.

Meanwhile, Erica spun on her heel. With a brutal, final motion,she hurled the lit lighter over her shoulder. It landed in the spreading pooL of gasoline that slicked the floor.

Without a flicker of hesitation, she stepped into the blaze.

In the blink of an eye, the world shattered-an explosion tore through the building, devouring it in flames.

No one witnessed the exact moment, but the shrill cry that split the air made every head turn.

"Watch out!" Vincent bellowed, pulling Hannah to the ground and throwing himself over her, his body shielding hers.

"Secure Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jones!" the bodyguards shouted as they scattered-some forming a protective wall, others dashing for extinguishers.

Panic rippled through the crowd.

Within minutes, sirens blared. Police cordoned off the area vhile firefiahters rushed in, their hoses hissing as they battled while firefighters rushed in, their hoses hissing as they battled the blaze.

When the flames finally surrendered, nothing remained but blackened steel and smoldering debris.

Soot-covered hands sifted through the ruins until they revealed a body, burned beyond recognition, limbs curled tight against the merciless heat.

No one questioned who it was. Every assumption pointed to Erica.

It felt like a Chapter had closed.

Beyond the barricades, the night air still reeked of smoke, ash drifting like gray snowflakes under the streetlights.

Vincent stood rigidly upright, answering the officers' questions in clipped, measured replies. His features were a mask, icy and impenetrable as stone.

A short distance behind, Hannah lingered in silence, her presence quiet but heavy.

Vincent had sent the bodyguards away on purpose. With his back turned to her, he appeared focused on the conversation,every gesture controlled, every word precise.

No one was watching Hannah.That-Vincent knew-was the opening she'd been waiting for, the perfect chance to run away.

Inside, his chest tightened with restless tension. He wasn't relaxed. He was braced. This wasn't negligence-it was deliberate. A test. He had stripped away the barriers, presented her with what looked like an effortless route to freedom. Every obstacle had been cleared. Every chain loosened.

Now, the only question left was brutal in its simplicity: after spending so many days together, would she still attempt to flee? A pulse hammered inside him, a vicious mix of dread and flee? A pulse hammered inside him, a vicious mix of dread and anticipation with every beat.

At last, he shifted his head inch by inch to glance back over his shoulder.

Hannah's eyes weren't on him. They were flicking over the scene around them-careful, calculated-yet he caught every movement. Her gaze snagged on an unattended exit, and the air between them thickened.

He held his silence, letting the tension coil tighter. If she dared to move-just one step forward... If she leaned the slightest bit toward that door, or if even a glimmer of longing broke across her face... He would seize her without hesitation. And once he had her, he'd lock her away in that suite forever. There would be no tenderness, no leniency. No more illusions of freedom.

In his mind, he'd rehearsed this moment a hundred times-the moment he'd catch her mid-flight and show her exactly what trying to escape him would cost.

Yet,when it came-absolutely nothing occurred.

Time crept forward, and the quiet at his back refused to break.She lingered where she was, his coat cloaking her, neither moving nor escaping. There was only stillness, and with it, only surrender. The hollow stare of someone who had barely slipped past death's grip.

A knot in Vincent's chest began to slacken, though only by a fraction. She hadn't tried to run. Why not? Had fear paralyzed her? Or had she finally abandoned the idea of escape altogether?

After finishing his statement to the officers, Vincent turned with measured slowness and closed the gap between them,one steady step after another.

When he stopped in front of her, Hannah lifted her eyes at last.Her voice came out faint, raqqed at the edges, yet clear."| Her voice came out faint, ragged at the edges, yet clear. "Is it over?"

"Yeah," V/incent murmured, his voice rough and low. His eyes stayed fixed on her, scouring the weariness in her gaze for even the faintest spark of rebellion, a flicker of longing to break free. But he found nothing. Her look held only exhaustion,steady and subdued.

His Adam's apple shifted as he swallowed hard. His chest tightened as the words clawed inside him, begging to be spoken. Didn't she want to break free?

But he smothered the thought before it reached his lips. Asking it aloud felt too dangerous-like striking glass already lined with cracks. One wrong touch, and the fragile stillness between them would fall to pieces. Worse, her answer might be something he could never bear.

So instead, he reached out with quiet hands, adjusting the coat resting on her shoulders, a gesture soft enough to hide the turmoil inside him. When his eyes found hers again-calm,luminous, and impossibly clear-his voice came out low,almost tender. "Let's go."

Just as he started to pull away, Hannah did something that stopped him cold. She reached out and wrapped her fingers around his hand.

Vincent stiffened in place, staring at their joined hands as if struggling to accept they were real.

She lifted her face to him, her voice low and worn thin, every word dragged from somewhere deep inside. Yet, what she said struck him harder than anything else. "Let's go home, Vincent.I'm too tired to stay out here." Her delicate fingers had wrapped around his. She had said home. Their home. For a fleeting instant, he allowed himself to believe it-that maybe she truly wanted to stay by his side. The thought swelled inside him, dangerous and tender.

He tightened his hold on her chilled hand, answering with a quiet, unshakable resolve, "Yeah. Let's go home."

From her hiding spot in the darkness, Erica's gaze followed Hannah and Vincent. Her stare was fixed and merciless, glinting like shards of ice as the two of them left.
###Chapter 368 Ousted

The charred body carried away by the police? It was merely a decoy, positioned by Erica to stage her own fake demise. It belonged to a woman of similar build who had already perished some time earlier.

Prior to the blaze, Erica had deliberately clothed the corpse in her garments and decorated it with her jewelry.

Then, when the lighter sparked and flames roared upward, it looked like she had stepped directly into the blaze. Yet in truth,she'd vanished through a concealed passage-one she had painstakingly arranged beforehand.

And regarding the confession she'd proclaimed so theatrically before the detonation? NNaturally, she had scripted every syllable.

She'd intended for Vincent and Hannah to hear it. She wanted them to grasp the lengths she had gone to. To witness the frenzy she was capable of just to possess Vincent. And above all, she had to divert their attention.

Recently, Vincent had been pressing closer. His inquiries were edging perilously near the nucleus of her dominion-the illegal business she built from the shadows. Clandestine factories.Smuggling channels. Covert laboratories distributed across countless cities. That was her authentic pillar. Her true fortune.

Thus, she had to mislead their investigation. To convince Vincent that all her resources had been squandered on jealous vendettas against Hannah. That every drop of her fixation,every violent scheme, arose purely from love and rivalry.

With "Erica Stanton" now officially dead, the pursuit ought to naturally conclude-with the alleged offender consumed by naturally conclude-with the alleged offender consumed by fire. And consequently, the remainder of her illegal empire would remain intact.

Erica had noticed the way Vincent regarded Hannah and the fierce protectiveness in his eyes. But this time, she felt no jealousy. On the contrary, her pleasure was warped, ecstatic.Because soon, she would take Hannah's place. The woman cradled in Vincent's embrace? That would become her. And Vincent-his loyalty, his affection, his complete self-would belong to her, and no other.



Within the secluded suite, Hannah remained at her desk,immersed in duties as always.

She was reviewing the quarterly progress report for Celestial Voyage, the flagship VR game under Luminara Group. Her brow creased with silent displeasure.

The report was vague and perfunctory-worse still, critical sections on engine testing and core mechanic iterations were left blank. All it said was, "Progressing as scheduled."Something was amiss. Seriously amiss.

This project wasn't a minor side effort-it was Luminara Group's foundation for future transformation, and her personal commitment. Even while trapped in forced seclusion, she had been monitoring the project through encrypted relays. The staff supporting it was hand-picked, loyal to her, and accustomed to sending her detailed weekly updates.

But across the last two weeks, the reports had grown markedly shorter. Crucial indicators had been omitted. Her explicit inquiries concerning engine refinement had gone without reply.

She attempted to log into the company's core management portal-only to face rejection. "Login Failed. Permission Denied.Please contact the system administrator." A jolt of dread coursed through her. Without delay, she dialed Ethan Caldwell, the technical head of Celestial Voyage.

The call rang repeatedly before he finally picked up.

"Why is the engine evaluation segment entirely blank?" Hannah demanded, her tone sharp and unyielding.

There was a pause. When Ethan finally spoke, his tone was guarded and distant. "Ms. Scott, everything is proceeding smoothly. The absent data is probably caused by a synchronization delay."

"Delayed? Delayed for two weeks?" Hannah's tone turned cold."Forward the unprocessed test archives. Immediately."

"Well, Ms. Scott, the raw archives include critical code. Under the latest directive, access demands the CEO's endorsed authorization."

"I am the CEO," Hannah stated bluntly.

A pause. Then, Ethan answered quietly, almost fearfully,"You may not have been informed yet... There's been a change in leadership. I... I am afraid I cannot elaborate further."

The line abruptly went dead.

Hannah fixed her eyes on the phone screen, her knuckles stiffening with strain. A change in the leadership? What kind of change? Had she been stripped of her position?

At that moment, her assistant, Meagan, called. Her tone rushed,stumbling over itself. "Ms. Scott, it's Harvey Langston from Granite Capital-he's aligned with those longtime board members who always opposed you! I don't know how they pulled it off, but they've been snatching shares relentlessly on the secondary exchange.They even overpaid to acquire stakes from minor shareholders!"

Pausing to let her words sink in. she added. "They skipped Pausing to let her words sink in, she added, "They skipped all normal protocols and staged a secret board assembly right after the market closed yesterday-only their allies were present. They voted to expel you, accusing you of 'prolonged remote oversight and neglect of executive duties, which damaged the corporation.' They dismissed you as both Chairwoman of the board and CEO, and immediately appointed Harvey Langston in your place."

Meagan's words cracked with anguish. "I was dismissed this morning."

Hannah frowned. So, she had indeed been ousted. The blow was tremendous. She pressed her palms against her temples,compelling herself to steady. "What percentage of shares do they hold altogether now?" she asked in a low voice.
###Chapter 369 My Battlefield
"Harvey and the others have secured 51.3% of the company shares!" Meagan said with urgency.

51.3%. Complete dominance. Despite holding a 34.5% stake,Hannah's influence on any shareholder vote had been erased.Harvey now possessed unrestricted command of the corporation-unchecked, unopposed.

"They dispatched their own team earlier today," Meagan continued bitterly. "Tech's admin rights have been revoked,Finance is under surveillance, and Legal is already staffed with their appointees."

"And the Celestial Voyage initiative?" Hannah asked, her voice tight as she forced herself to stay steady and catch onto the key point.

Meagan faltered and then delivered the crushing news."The new CEO's assistant-brought in by Harvey-declared a 'strategic realignment.' The venture is suspended indefinitely.The core team has been dissolved, and Ethan's reassigned to maintain the outdated system."

Hannah's chest tightened. She had gravely miscalculated.She'd thought remote management would be enough to preserve her control. She had not foreseen Harvey exploiting weaknesses so swiftly. He'd stripped her of everything.And he had not even granted her the courtesy of notice. To the rest,she was no longer the company founder, no longer the dominant stakeholder. She was just a ghost-a vanished,irrelevant entity no longer in the equation.

But she refused to concede. Steadying herself, she gave Meagan a single order. "Wait for my signal." Then, she acted. She composed a concise message for Felix and Miles, outlining the hostile seizure, Harvey's illicit maneuvers, the freezing of the Celestial Voyage initiative, and her present "disappeared" condition. She encrypted the email and hit send.

For Felix, she assigned a mission-protect offshore research and markets, block Granite Capital from global assets, and begin compiling outside evidence for litigation.

Felix's reply arrived within minutes, lending her a measure of relief.

Miles, however, remained abroad with his mother and sister after the Alice affair. Several hours passed before his eventual response reached Hannah.

Afterward, Hannah issued a public notice: "Due to urgent private matters, I have temporarily stepped aside from day-to -day operations. Nonetheless, I remain directly engaged in long -term company strategy. I will address shareholders shortly."

The statement also subtly hinted at "irregular behavior from certain shareholders," and her intent to pursue legal action if necessary.

It was designed to buy time, reassure minority shareholders, and spook those wavering on the fence. But this was insufficient.She required a decisive strike.

Her thoughts churned, scanning every flagged priority. One dossier surfaced-The NeuroCore Initiative. It was a groundbreaking neural-interface endeavor designed to enable seamless, immersive connection between humans and systems.

The file had already cleared internal approval under her authorization. And Harvey, predictably shortsighted, had brushed it off as trivial. That left her access intact.

She reopened the dossier and scrutinized it again, carefully this She reopened the dossier and scrutinized it again,carefully this time. This was no side pursuit-it was the path ahead. Harvey,blinded by greed, obsessed with immediate wins and power grabs, failed to grasp the scope.

But she did. And even more compelling, the Jones Group was developing a similar interface. A bold idea ignited in her mind.

At dinner time, Hannah sat opposite Vincent as usual. She ate wordlessly, her grace intact, but tonight, her presence carried weight, sharpened by an unfamiliar frost.

Vincent sensed the shift immediately. He had only just been informed of upheavals at Luminara Group. His gaze was steady as he looked at her. "Still thinking about Luminara?" His voice was calm, tinged with the steady confidence of one perpetually composed.

Hannah raised her gaze to meet his. In those clear depths,displeasure burned. "Vincent, do you know Harvey Langston's method of seizing the Luminara Group?"

Vincent arched an eyebrow, inviting her explanation.

"A strike." Her lips curved into a cutting smile. "While I was trapped here, cut off from the outside world,he rallied a few fence-sitters and swept up shares on the open market. Then,he sidestepped protocol, summoned a private board session-one motion, and I was displaced."

Vincent's brow tightened, but silence remained. She was blaming him.

Still, Hannah's focus did not falter. "He owns 51.3% of the shares. On record, that's full authority. But do you know what that really means? It means he has to constantly maintain that alliance. Granite Capital alone lacks a majority; he leans on smaller investors. If that alliance cracks, or if a new contender emerges to weaken his grip..." She left the sentence unfinished, but the meaning was She left the sentence unfinished, but the meaning was unmistakable.

Vincent looked at her, eyes unreadable. "So? You expect me to help you reclaim the comnpany?" His voice carried faint amusement, as though probing her resolve.

"No." Hannah's response was sharp and instant. Not a flicker of hesitation crossed her eyes. "That's my battlefield."

Her tone then hardened-razor-edged, her stare blazing. "But I need one breach from you. Just a single opening for me to reclaim the company myself."
###Chapter 370 Emergency Meeting
 "Oh? An opening?" Vincent leaned in slightly, drawn by the blaze of conviction and ambition in Hannah's tone. He preferred this side of Hannah-cornered, yet still flashing her defiance.

Hannah slid the NeuroCore Initiative across the table. "Read this."

Vincent lifted it and flipped through the pages. At first, his glance was detached, but then, it sharpened into intent. The promise of the NeuroCore Initiative was unmistakable.

"This invention belongs to Luminara Group, and the patent is still valid," Hannah declared firmly. "And that fool Harvey Langston discarded it like rubbish."

Vincent lowered the document and studied her, eyes alive with interest. "What do you want?"

Hannah held his stare without wavering, her words edged with the precision of high-stakes negotiation.′′Apartnership." Her tone remained steady. "Jones Group steps in as a principal investor. You subscribe to Luminara Group's new issuance-not a token five percent, but a sum that drags Harvey's command below fifty percent."

Vincent arched a brow. "Do you grasp the scale of capital required?"

"Jones Group isn't lacking in funds." A self-assured curve lifted her lips. "And this innovation-NeuroCore Initiative-will deliver far greater profits for your company."

Her cadence cut sharper, her outline exact. "If we pull this off,Harvey's bloc drops to roughly 48%. Once his absolute
Harvey's bloc drops to roughly 48%. Once his absolute dominance vanishes, the dissenting voices he's silenced inside Luminara Group will reemerge. The hesitant shareholders will recalculate. With my existing shares and influence combined,I'll have enough weight to launch a counterstrike at the coming shareholder session."

She held his gaze firmly, striking the conclusion. "Vincent,this is mutual gain. You anchor a position in the next frontier of human-computer interaction and secure meaningful equity in Luminara Group-at a fair price. You share in its future ascent.It's a deal you won't regret."

Vincent regarded her-this fierce, unrelenting woman before him. So unlike the serene and quiet Hannah he once knew. And yet, this version of her was dangerously magnetic. He respected her sharpness, her calculation-the refusal to collapse even when driven into a corner. Most of all, her plan was deeply enticing. The NeuroCore Initiative was something he fully intended to possess. Seizing major Luminara Group equity aligned seamlessly with Jones Group's long-term strategy.

As for Harvey and Granite Capital? To Vincent, they were barely an obstacle. Yes, the risks existed. But the potential return-was colossal. And there was another allure he savored.The thrill of watching Hannah claw her way back, reclaiming what had been stripped from her, aided by his hand, with the certainty that ultimately, she would remain within his hold...

Vincent rose deliberately, his expression dark and unreadable,threaded with a tactician's thrill. "I accept your proposal."

Having achieved her goal, Hannah lifted a brow, the faint glimmer of triumph touching her mouth.



A few days later, Hannah, together with Miles and Felix,forcefully convened a new, public shareholders' session. On the day of the meeting, the top-floor conference chamber of Luminara Group was packed with shareholders.

Harvey occupied the foremost seat with calm dominance.

Though the meeting had not yet begun, the room already buzzed with whispers.

"Hannah Scott summoned us here. But where is she?"

"Heard she's still caught in personal affairs. No one's reached her. What's the point of this meeting?"

"Exactly! She's only grasping at power-clinging after being toppled.Pathetic,really."

At the muttering, a smirk curved Harvey's lips. He cleared his throat, speaking with measured command. "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining this urgent shareholders ' session. Sadly, Ms. Scott won't be attending today."

A wave of derisive laughter rippled through the room, chiefly from those bound to Harvey's faction.

"Ha! Told you. Who knows where she's skulking? What a farce."

"Mr. Langston, I suggest we cut the act and close this meeting."

Harvey lifted a hand for calm, though his satisfaction gleamed through. "Though Ms. Scott is absent, we remain obligated to follow the agenda per company policy..."

At that instant, the massive chamber doors swung wide with force. Vincent entered first.

Harvey's grin froze on his face. What in hell was Vincent doing here? He was meant to "keep an eye"on Hannah!

But Vincent did not stride into the room immediately. Instead,he paused and stepped slightly to the side. And in that brief, pointed interval-all attention swiveled to the threshold.Hannah stepped in with unwavering composure. She glanced at her watch and allowed a subtle smile. "Mr.Langston,patience. I'm only five minutes delayed."
###Chapter 371 The Showdown
Hours before the shareholders' meeting,Hannah had originally planned to attend remotely via encrypted video link.

Vincent, however, had abruptly changed his mind at the last minute. Instead, he'd escorted her straight into Luminara Group's towering headquarters.

The moment Harvey spotted Vincent and Hannah, a flicker of shock darted across his eyes before he quickly masked it. Rising to his feet, he plastered on an effusive smile. "Mr. Jones, what an extraordinary surprise!" he declared, voice booming with well-practiced warmth.

Each word carried just the right mix of reverence and delight,as though Vincent's arrival were the greatest privilege imaginable.

Harvey extended his hand with deliberate humility, bowing his posture ever so slightly in an attempt to flatter.

Vincent dipped his chin in the barest acknowledgment,ignoring the extended hand. His eyes cut across the conference room like blades, and the faint buzz of gossip dissolved instantly beneath the weight of his presence.

Harvey's carefully crafted smile slipped for half a heartbeat before he pivoted smoothly toward Hannah, still standing quietly at Vincent's side. His grin widened, almost too polished,as he exclaimed, "Well, look who's here-Hannah! I can't tell you how glad I am to see you again!"

His voice dripped with feigned warmth, pitched just a little too high. "We all heard you've been preoccupied with... personal matters, running things from a distance. We were so concerned It's wonderful to finally have you back." The way he lingered on "personal matters" and from a distance" wasn't lost on anyone-every word carefully sharpened to suggest she'd abandoned her responsibilities.

Hannah observed his act with quiet detachment, the faintest curl of mockery tugging at her lips. Her eyes narrowed to an edge, slicing through the mask of warmth on his face. "Mr.Langston, there's no need for concern. While I was away, the company 'legally' removed me. Seems Luminara Group operates just fine without me."

The sharp bite in her voice nearly wiped the grin off Harvey's face. A shadow crossed his gaze, though he smothered it quickly, donning an expression of heavy sorrow. He let out a practiced sigh, as though the weight of responsibility had crushed him. "Hannah, that's not fair..." His tone dripped with wounded sincerity. "Every step the board took was in line with proper procedures. You couldn't be reached then, and the company couldn't operate without a leader. The shareholders were in a frenzy. I only stepped in when the crisis demanded it."

"Proper procedures?" Hannah's voice cut in like steel, sharp and unyielding. "Section 102 of the Corporate Charter Act-every board and shareholder meeting must be preceded by formal notice to all directors, auditors, and stakeholders."

Her eyes locked onto Harvey with chilling precision. "I, Hannah Scott, hold 34.5% of this company's shares. When the board voted to strip me of the Chairwoman and CEO positions,tell me-did any of you ever bother to inform me of the meeting?"

Brendan Warner, director of Solterra Capital, shot out of his seat,face flushed, voice shrill enough to rattle the room. "Ms.Scott! Please adjust your demeanor when addressing this board!"He jabbed a finger toward the table. "Mr. Langston has poured blood and sweat into keeping this company alive! And you? You disappeared without a trace! Now that the merger is finally stable, you barge back in to launch some witch hunt? At the very least, show some damn gratitude!" Travis Kincaid, representing SwiftRock Capital, leaned back with a smug air, his words dripping with condescension. "That's right,Ms. Scott. Youthful impulsion is one thing, but this level of hostility is nothing but reckless. Mr. Langston stepped in during a crisis, kept the company from collapsing, and this is how you repay him? By tearing into him? Do you really think that's the right way to repay him?"

A soft, derisive scoff slipped from Hannah's lips. Tilting her head, she let her gaze settle coldly on both Brendan and Travis,her eyes gleaming with sharp amusement. "Iwonder-how much did Harvey promise the two of you?"

Her tone cut through the room like a surgeon's scalpel-precise,merciless. "Why the hell are you so fucking desperate to play his lapdogs? Was it the rotten debt from the illegal loan Solterra Capital guaranteed that he swept under the rug for you? Or perhaps it was the gaping hole in SwiftRock Capital's books from using client margin funds for stock speculation that he conveniently patched using Granite Capital's money?"

She had walked into this meeting fully prepared, every secret of Harvey's cronies already tucked neatly in her pocket.

Hannah's voice cracked through the room like a lightning strike."Do you really think barking for Harvey will hide the filth on your own hands? You've been leeching off Luminara Group for so long. Push me one more inch, and I'll kick you guys out and unroot your force before the day is done."

The words hit like a hammer blow. Both Brendan and Travis blanched, their faces drained of all color, their protests strangled before they could rise.

The air in the conference room froze.

Not a single one dared move. Hannah's presence pressed down on the room with an iron weight, leaving even seasoned executives rattled. Vincent lowered himself into his chair with composed authority,his eyes sweeping across the gathering-piercing,glacial,and relentless.

Hannah's expression didn't waver. Step by deliberate step, she crossed the room, her heels striking the floor like a countdown.She moved toward the chairman's seat-the throne of absolute power within Luminara Group.

Harvey's expression twisted, shadows of anger hardening his face. Fury burned in his eyes as he lunged forward, planting himself squarely in Hannah's way. His voice cracked like a whip,sharp with hostility. "You've got no fucking right to that chair,Hannah Scott! It belongs to me, and only me!"

Hannah halted just before colliding with him, lifting her chin in a quiet show of defiance. Meeting his glare without flinching,she spoke with a steadiness that carried more weight than his fury ever could. "Is that so? | wouldn't count on it."

Then,drawing in a measured breath, she delivered the words that shattered the room's silence. "This shareholder meeting exists for one purpose only-to strip you of that position,and we'll do it by the book."
###Chapter 372 Don't You Dare Lay A Hand On Him!
"Remove me?" Harvey barked out a harsh, mocking laugh, his features carved with insolence. "I command 51.3% of the shares. Absolute control. None of you can cast me aside."

His declaration thundered with authority, tinged with smugness."No hand in this room has the strength to unseat me."

One of his underlings piped up, shrill and fawning, "Indeed! Mr.Langston holds more than half-thinking he can be ousted is laughable!"

Yet, Hannah merely regarded him, her face unreadable. With measured poise, she drew out an official document. "I, Hannah Scott, together with Felix Wade and Miles Whitaker, hereby place before this shareholders' assembly the motion to dismiss Harvey Langston from the board and his office as CEO."

"Pathetic!" Harvey jeered, as though indulging in some comedy."Fine then! Let us vote. Any who favor my removal-lift your hands."

His gaze swept the crowd with overbearing pride."Ms. Scott,the three of you combined barely scrape above 40%. Who among other shareholders dares align with you?"

His glare raked through the neutral section, cutting like steel.Under his oppressive eyes, most averted their faces, sinking into uneasy silence.

Moments dragged, thick with tension

As Harvey's grin spread wider, from the rear, a quiet gesture broke the stillness. A bespectacled, middle-aged man raised his hand with hesitation. Hannah's eyes caught the motion, faint surprise flashing before she inclined her head.

It was Louis Hinton, a minor investor in Luminara Group,possessing less than 0.5%. "I support Ms. Scott..." he murmured,voice unsteady.

"Splendid," Harvey answered with a chilling curl of his lips. A fool stepping out of line.

With a snap of his fingers, Harvey barked, "Security! This man appears unwell-confused.Escort him out for some rest."

Two security guards advanced immediately, intent on dragging Louis away.

"Don't you dare lay a hand on him!" Hannah's tone cracked like thunder, her eyes burning into the guards.

The two security guards froze instantly, a tremor running through them, hands suspended awkwardly mid-action.

Harvey swung toward Hannah, fury flashing, contempt etched on his sneer. "Hannah, you still fail to grasp reality, don't you?"He gestured toward Louis with derision, raising his smallest finger in ridicule. "A shareholder with just 0.5%? What good is shielding him?"

He stepped closer, voice lowered, laced with venom. "Besides,are you even capable of shielding him?"

Hannah held firm, her reply unwavering. "No matter how minuscule his shares, he remains a stakeholder of Luminara Group. And as long as I stand here, I won't allow you to disgrace him with underhanded tactics."

As her words hung in the air, she cast a fleeting glance at Vincent, seated calmly in the front row.

Vincent responded with the slightest flick of his hand. That single motion was enouqh. From the back, four of Vincent's private security emerged like shadows, swiftly placing themselves between Louis and the two guards.

The two guards froze, trapped, eyes flickering toward Harvey for instructions.

Hannah's lips curved faintly, a blade-thin smile as her gaze returned to Harvey. "Well then, Mr. Langston," she murmured with icy composure, "tell me-do you think I can shield him, or not?"

A suffocating hush blanketed the room.

Harvey's complexion shifted from ashen to enraged crimson,fury boiling under his skin. His teeth clenched as he spat,"Impressive! Truly impressive!"

With a violent wave of his arm, Harvey snapped, "Stand down!"

The two guards recoiled instantly, retreating to the sidelines like beaten hounds.

Harvey's mouth twisted again, every word dripping venom as he glared at Hannah. "I'd love to see you try to remove me-with what?" He jerked his chin toward Louis, scorn thick in his tone."That shareholder with a measly 0.5% of the shares?Ridiculous. Let us witness which fools dare back this madness.Everyone,raise your hands if you support Ms. Scott."

His stare prowled over the room, menacing, daring any soul to rise against him.

The silence returned, heavy and unbroken. No one stirred.

Then, Vincent, deliberate and composed,lifted his hand.
###Chapter 373 Relying On Men


Harvey's eyes landed on Vincent. For an instant, his body stiffened. Then, he erupted in loud, derisive laughter. "Mr.Jones-seriously? That pitiful 3% holding of yours? A drop in the ocean. You imagine it'll change anything? Get real."

But Hannah interjected, her tone razor-sharp, "Who claimed it was only 3%?"

She lifted her hand, pressing her tablet screen.

The towering LED panel flickered alive before shifting to display an altered ownership chart. Harvey's Granite Capital was listed at 48.2%-no longer a majority. Besides it, the Jones Group-20.0%.

Gasps surged through the room.

"Impossible! This is fake! A scam!" Harvey stumbled back,nearly colliding with a chair. His complexion drained to ash."There's no way the Jones Group hold 20%! Absolutely impossible!"

Hannah's voice rang like iron, unwavering. "Shall I summon Mr.Jones's CFO to present the executed agreements and verified bank statements? Or-" Her eyes cut toward Vincent with knowing certainty. "Mr. Jones, what about you disclose it personally?"

Vincent rose steadily, gaze locked on Harvey with quiet authority. "Jones Group has finalized a strategic subscription of newly issued shares in Luminara Group. Our stake now equals 20%. All records and transfers are complete. Would you like a certifie d copy, Mr. Langston?" With a heavy slump, Harvey collapsed back into His chair.strength abandoning him. The battle was lost. Irrevocably.completely lost. Every fortress he built-yet one fatal gap undone him. And Hannah struck without hesitation.

Hannah advanced, composure as unyielding as granite,addressing the room, her words cut firm and decisive, "As of this moment, in accordance with the Luminara Group Charter,I possess effective voting rights exceeding the absolute majority threshold. I hereby announce the immediate removal of Mr.Harvey Langston from his roles as CEO and Chairman of Luminara Group. All executive powers are revoked."

She paused briefly, her tone dropping to arctic frost."Additionally, every decision, directive, or transaction undertaken by Mr. Langston in the role of CEO, after the loss of my and other principal shareholders' support, shall be deemed invalid and void."

She delivered one final, steely glance across the gathering."And for those with objections-your opinion is noted and dismissed."

Then,without waiting for a response,she turned to the stunned man slumped in the chair. "My regrets, Mr. Langston," she murmured coolly. "But this chair? It remains mine."

That single line shattered the last remnants of Harvey's composure.

"Hannah Scott! What makes you so arrogant?" he suddenly barked, jerking up his head, eyes bloodshot, voice cracking under venomous fury. "At the end of the day, you still relied on a man! Without Vincent, you think you'd have made a comeback? A 20% stake from the Jones Group-what did that cost you? How many nights in his bed did you barter to secure that favor,huh?"

Vincent's head turned slowly, his brow hardening, expression Slackening in an instant. A suffocating chill rippled outward blackening in an instant. A suffocating chill rippled outward,suffusing the room like an oncoming storm. The bodyguards at his back braced,ready.

But Hannah didn't need the guards. Without a word, she strode forward and struck Harvey across the face.

Harvey never anticipated it. A blur, and then fire seared his cheek.

The room froze in silence.

Every eye fixed, stunned by the severity and precision of that blow. Swift. Unflinching.

Hannah stood unwavering, flexing her hand against the sting,her gaze colder than winter frost. She regarded him as one might a pest crawling from filth. "I relied on a man?" Her voice dripped with ridicule. "Harvey Langston, before you throw baseless accusations around, maybe you should look in the mirror. Didn't you do exactly the same thing you accused me of?"

Her words cracked through the air like a lash. "You clawed upward by fastening yourself to groveling sycophants,backroom conspirators, and dirty financiers. You hid behind their schemes, fattened on their corruption, and leaned on their protection. Strip away their crooked scaffolding-without those mutts clearing your road, what would you be?"

Harvey's features contorted in humiliation. Gripping his throbbing cheek, he fumbled to form a retort.

Hannah did not waste another look. She pivoted, commanding the shareholder body once more. Her tone regained icy poise,cleaving the tension. "Yes, the Jones Group's 20% acquisition was indeed facilitated by me. But the foundation of that deal was legitimate commerce-an exclusive license of Luminara Group's proprietary technology, secured by equity financing from the Jones Group." She paused, letting her gaze sweep across the room with forceful precision. "The agreement is transparent, the documentation complete, and the value mutually fair-aligned entirely with the company's strategic trajectory. It was a lawful partnership-no more, no less."

Then, her voice sharpened with lethal warning. "Any who dare distort this into scandal, any who attempt to smear a shareholder's integrity for selfish ends-know that Luminara Group's legal division will prosecute in full measure, without concession."

The room held its breath.

Hannah gave the room time to absorb her words. Then, casting a glance at her watch, she declared with finality,"Allprincipal motions have been resolved. This meeting stands adjourned."
###Chapter 374 Her Joy

After the meeting ended, Hannah was surrounded by a cluster of shareholders. Their expressions brimmed with awe and eagerness, their words drenched in flattery and overflowing with hope for the future.

In sharp contrast to the arrogance he had flaunted moments earlier, Harvey now stood utterly isolated. Not a single person approached him. Even his so-called allies-Brendan and Travis -kept their distance, unwilling to be associated with his failure.

Across the room, Vincent remained composed, a quiet center of gravity for the ambitious business elites hovering nearby,each one eager to catch his attention. He simply lifted his hand,a subtle gesture that was enough to silence every advance and scatter the would-be sycophants.

Vincent's eyes slipped past the restless crowd until they found Hannah. There it was-the spark in her gaze, the unmistakable brilliance of triumph she couldn't conceal, no matter how hard she tried.

Tilting his head slightly, Vincent leaned toward the head of his security team and spoke in a low, clipped tone. "Dig into everything. Granite Capital, Harvey Langston-every hidden deal,every offshore account, every piece of leverage. I want him to learn a lesson. The harsh way."

"Yes, Mr. Jones." The head of the security team gave a respectful nod before quietly moving off to carry out the order.

Breaking away from the shareholders, Hannah crossed the room toward Vincent. Her steps were light, her face unguarded and aglow with rare delight. "Let's return," she murmured. Vincent studied her for a long moment, his gaze deep and unreadable. At last, he gave a faint nod. "Alright."

Soon, the limousine eased away from Luminara Group headquarters and slipped seamlessly into the stream of evening traffic.

Inside the car, Hannah leaned back against the plush leather seat. The smile tugging at her lips lingered, refusing to fade.

Vincent's gaze lingered on her profile, intrigued by the seldom softness he saw in her. "It's the first time I've ever seen you this happy," he murmured, breaking the quiet that filled the vehicle.

Hannah turned to him at his words, her eyes bright. "Yeah," she admitted without hesitation. "I really enjoy this feeling."

"What feeling?" Vincent leaned forward slightly, hiscuriosity sharpening, almost captivated by the glow she carried.

"Being in control." Confidence laced her tone, steady and unapologetic. "Watching my enemies walk straight into checkmate. Taking back what's mine with my own hands."She gave a soft laugh. "It feels incredible."

There was no attempt to hide the ambition in her voice, no mask to soften the edge of satisfaction. This Hannah-sharp,unapologetic, openly powerful-was worlds apart from the gentle facade she had once shown Vincent. Yet, it was this very version of her that he found dangerously irresistible.

He sat in silence, watching every flicker of emotion play across her face. The faint irritation he had carried earlier-resentment that she was slipping from his grasp-slowly shifted. In its place rose something stronger, darker. A tangled pull of admiration and a possessiveness that ran deep enough to consume. He liked her like this-liked the unapologetic sharpness that cut through every word and gesture. Hannah kept her eyes fixed out of the window, though her thoughts churned restlessly. She didn't want to return just yet.Then, something caught her attention-a bustling supermarket teeming with shoppers. If she could just slip inside that crowd,maybe she'd find a way to escape.

The thought seized her suddenly, urgent and impossible to ignore. "Stop the car!" she burst out, her voice sharp with excitement.

Vincent turned his head slightly, one brow arching. "What is it?"

The limousine hadn't stopped, but the driver considerably eased off the gas.

Hannah forced her tone into something light, almost playful."Let's go grocery shopping," she said with casual ease.

Tilting her head, she let a trace of measured expectation color her expression. "It's been ages since we went to the supermarket together."

For a moment, her words painted a fragile illusion-that they were nothing more than an ordinary couple, fresh from work with a sudden whim to buy ingredients for dinner.

Vincent's silence stretched on, unreadable.

The brightness in Hannah's eyes dimmed under the weight of it.She lowered her gaze and softened her voice to showcase her disappointment in this way. "Alright then, forget it."

Just as she leaned back against the seat, ready to abandon the plan, he finally spoke up. "Fine. Stop the car."

The driver pulled over smoothly by the supermarket entrance.

Hannah's head snapped up, her eyes flashing with surprise before joy quickly followed. "You're really agreeing?"

Vincent pushed the car door open, answering with nothing Vincent pushed the car door open, answering with nothing more than a faint, "Yeah."

Inside, the supermarket was overflowing with people, a tide of shoppers rushing in for the sale session. The promotional event had turned the aisles into a frenzy of movement and noise.

Vincent's bodyguards pushed forward, attempting to carve out a small pocket of space around Vincent and Hannah, shielding them from the press of shoppers.

But the effort was futile. The crowd was far too dense, a restless tide of bodies moving in every direction.

The two bodyguards kept close, trailing only a few steps behind,yet their view was constantly swallowed by the shifting throng.

A faint crease formed between Vincent's brows. The noise, the crush of people-it grated on his nerves, each second wearing at his patience. He instinctively reached out and firmly grasped Hannah's wrist. It felt icy to touch her skin.
###Chapter 375 Her Greatest Vulnerability             
Vincent's hold on Hannah's wrist was firm-achingly firm-but Hannah didn't resist. Instead, she edged closer to him, making the action seem like a gesture of affection so it wouldn't arouse his suspicion.

Hannah acted as if the bustling surroundings fascinated her,eyes brimming with wonder and naive curiosity. "So many people," she whispered, sounding amazed. She suppressed a smirk. The more people, the better.

Hannah and Vincent drifted with the steady push of the throng when she noticed a queue stretching before a stall piled with snacks.

She halted abruptly. Maybe this could serve as her excuse-to purchase something-and slip away unnoticed among the crowd. With that thought, her attention intentionally fixed on a box of matcha ice cream resting in the chilled case.

"Want one?" Vincent's hushed tone brushed her ear, his eyes following the direction of her glance. His brows arched faintly.He clearly had no fondness for such sweet indulgences.

Hannah fluttered her lashes, eyed the long queue, and then surveyed the cramped, noisy press of people, feigning just the right blend of longing and hesitation. "Yes, but theline's too long."

She paused, looking conflicted. Then, like she'd made up her mind, she added, "Still, I really want one. I'll line up."

Vincent gripped her wrist. "You want it that badly?"

"Yes!" Hannah replied brightly, her gaze alight with fabricated "Yes!" Hannah replied brightly, her gaze alight with fabricated joy. "After we got married, you often sent Derek to fetch them for me. Don't you remember?"

It was pure invention-but one she hoped might soften him.

Vincent fell silent. He truly had no memory of that. "Stay here.I'll get it." At last, he released her wrist and glanced toward the bustling stall.

Hannah lowered her lashes faintly. If he insisted on going himself, even better-her chance to vanish increased. She nodded at once, her tone sugary and eager. "Okay! I'll be right here!"

Vincent's towering, imposing figure stood out harshly against the noisy disorder around him as he approached the stall.Even merely queuing, his natural aura of distance carved an unspoken circle between him and others.

As soon as he turned and merged intothe line, the sweet,obedient smile drained from Hannah's lips-gone like water pulled back to the sea. In its place, icy resolve emerged.Waiting for him? Not a chance.

Without pause,Hannah pushed into the more congested, unruly fresh produce section nearby. Her chest pounded, but her mind cut sharp and steady.

She didn't dash toward the main entrance-too predictable Instead, she wove between shoppers and stacked goods, using both as cover.

Because of the recent Luminara Group debacle, Vincent had finally given her phone back to her. While moving, she typed quickly. "Claude, where's my mom?"

She planned to leave for good-with her mother.

Almost instantly, her screen lit up with a response from Claude."Hannah, your mom's with Vincent. You didn't know?" Before her thoughts could settle, the phone buzzed again-Claude was calling.

She declined silently, erasing both the message and the call record in one swift motion. Her stomach dropped. So, her mother was kept with Vincent. She had always believed, after the burial, that her mother had been placed in long-term hospital care. She hadn't expected him to hide her mother just because she fled during the funeral. So this time, he struck first, seizing her greatest vulnerability-her mother-to chain her to him. So cruel. So calculated

Hannah's gaze turned glacial in an instant. The fleeting rush of hope she felt during her attempted escape was brutally extinguished by reality. What surged up instead was blazing fury -and a degrading sense of being treated like a pawn.

She stopped at a seafood counter. Her eyes fixed on a grouper gliding inside the tank, sharp and calculating. This failed getaway-she'd disguise it as a sudden whim to purchase that fish. A neat, believable reason for drifting from Vincent's side.One that wouldn't spark doubt.

She pointed at the tank and said to the supermarket staff member, "That one-can you get it out for me?"

Elsewhere in the supermarket, Vincent stepped fromn the crowd,holding a finely wrapped box of matcha ice cream. His brows drew together tightly. The spot where Hannah should have been waiting for him was utterly vacant. His chest lurched violently. Where the hell was she?

At first, he assumed she'd been swallowed up in the crowd. He swept the area with piercing focus, eyes combing every corner.

Finally, he spotted a figure near the fruit displays. A woman-similar build, similar height-her back turned, appearing to choose fruit. There she was.
###Chapter 376 There You Are

Without a second thought, Vincent shoved his way through the crush of bodies, barreling straight toward that woman.

He reached out, his hand just about to land on her shoulder,when the woman suddenly spun around.

Their eyes locked.

Vincent froze, his hand suspended in midair. All the urgency, all the hope etched across his face, iced over in an instant-as if someone had dumped a bucket of freezing water on him. It wasn't Hannah. Just a stranger who happened to look like her.

A crushing weight of disappointment slammed into his chest.His mind replayed the past few days in brutal flashes. Hannah's sudden tenderness. The way she'd cooked for him every day.The night she'd invited him to join her bed.

Then,the vulnerability-perfectly timed-right when the crisis at Luminara Group had exploded. He'd given in, softened, and even brought her back to the office to help. On the way back,she'd spotted the supermarket and suggested shopping, as if on a whim.

And just earlier, she had looked at that box of ice cream with what appeared to be longing. Every glance. Every word. It all lined up too perfectly. That wasn't coincidence. That wasn't affection. It was a plan. A carefully crafted one.

She had played him-exploited his weakness, taken advantage of the rare tenderness he allowed himself, and leveraged the feelings he couldn't even bring himself to admit.

Step by step, she'd slipped past his defenses, earned his trust,and made him believe, if only for a second, that maybe-just maybe-she had begun to truly rely on him. And then, right when he finally lowered his guard and stood there queuing for that damn ice cream for her, she had vanished. Without hesitation.

A low, dangerous laugh slipped past Vincent's lips, simmering with fury. Very well, she was patient. She was clever. And she was one hell of an actress.

The air around him seemed to drop in temperature, the pressure radiating from him suffocating. He yanked out his phone, voice sharp as steel. "Mobilize everyone. Turn this place inside out if you have to-l want Hannah found. Now."

"Yes!" came the clipped response. The two bodyguards at his side instantly reached for their radios, barking urgent orders and calling in every resource at their disposal. Mrs. Jones had slipped away again. This was going to be a problem.



Hannah carried the grouper in a shopping bag, looking for all the world like an ordinary shopper blending seamlessly into the bustling crowd. Her steps were unhurried, her ears sharply tuned to every sound around her.

It didn't take long before she picked up on it-a sudden surge of men in black suits flooding in from the supermarket entrance.They fanned out quickly, efficient and precise, splitting into teams to launch a coordinated sweep.

She knew instantly who they were. Vincent's men. Fast response. She almost had to give him credit.

A cold smirk tugged at the corner of her lips. She wasn't surprised.

She deliberately lingered in several blind spots along the way,letting the cameras miss her. Yes, her mother was still in Vincent's hands, and she had already decided she would go back. But that didn't mean she had to let herself be found so back. But that didn't mean she had to let herself be found so easily.Let Vincent stew for a while. Freedom didn't come often,and even if it was only temporary, it deserved to besavored.

Meanwhile, the seach closed in with ruthless precision.

At last, the head bodyguard rushed over, his shirt sticking to him with sweat, and braced himself as he delivered the report. "Mr.Jones, we've checked every section thoroughly. Surveillance has been pulled, but with the heavy crowd and all the blind spots, there's still no trace of Mrs. Jones. She must've slipped out during the commotion."

"Clear the place!" Vincent's voice was raw, hoarse with fury and finality. "Search again! Every corner! Leave nothing unchecked!"

His gaze hardened as he added, "Notify the team outside! Lock down every intersection. Expand the perimeter-five kilometers out! I want every car, every pedestrian searched!"

"Yes, Mr. Jones!" the head bodyguard snapped, immediately getting on to carry out the orders.

Minute by minute, time bled away.

The supermarket's loudspeakers crackled and then blared an emergency announcement on repeat. "Dear customers, due to an unexpected equipment malfunction, the store is undergoing urgent maintenance. Please collect your belongings and proceed to the nearest exits as directed by staff. We apologize for the inconvenience."

The crowd grew restless, voices rising in complaint and frustration, yet under the firm direction of security staff and the men in black, they had no choice but to shuffle slowly toward the exits.

Hannah understood exactly what was happening-the sweep had begun. Vincent couldn't track her down, so he was taking Hrastic measures. A faint, sardonic smile touched her lips. Now drastic measures. A faint, sardonic smile touched her lips. Now,she should show up.

Instead of following the flow, she slipped against the tide of bodies, pressing forward toward Vincent.

And then, she spotted him-that tall, commanding figure standing in the middle of the chaos.

"Vincent!" she called out, her voice carrying above the noise.He turned slowly, his eyes locking on her. "There you are!l′Vbeen looking everywhere for you."

She flashed a poised smile, flipping the story on its head as if she had been the one desperately searching all along.
###Chapter 377 Not Running Away
 Vincent observed Hannah "forcing" her way past the dense throng,each step toward him marked by"evident strain."

Acting without thinking, he moved forward and clamped his hand tightly around her wrist.

Hannah's brows drew together ever so faintly at his grip,but she said nothing.

Vincent's gaze drilled into her. "Where were you?"

She raised the plastic sack carrying the fish, her expression composed."I went to buy a fish. You're fond of grilled grouper,aren't you?" Her voice carried an ease as if they were discussing the weather, her eyes steady as they met his. "I noticed some fresh ones over there,so I bought one."

Her eyes flicked over the turmoil surrounding them."But when I returned to look for you, you weren't standing in the ice cream line anymore. Then, an announcement mentioned some malfunction and crowd regulation. Chaos broke out after that.I've been searching for you since then."

Vincent's tone came sharp, underpinned with skepticism."You weren't attempting to flee?"

Hannah blinked, seemingly caught off guard. Calculated pain flickered across her face. "You thought I ran away?"

"Yes." The syllable rasped from his throat like a growl.His stare fixed upon her, dissecting every nuance of her expression.

She looked back at him, the measured hurt shifting into a mixture of disbelief and outrage. She jerked her wrist,
 mixture of disbelief and outrage. She jerked her wrist,struggling against his grasp. Her voice shook with both hurt and exasperation. "Vincent! That's outrageous! I only went to buy a fish! I've been scouring that chaotic crowd looking for you!l was terrified! Escaping never once crossed my mind!"

Before her words even finished spilling, Vincent's grip of her wrist suddenly slackened. But in the very next moment, his arm shot forward,yanking her violently into his chest.

Hannah didn't see it coming. Her forehead collided with his solid chest in a muted thump. His arms encircled her with such intensity thatit felt as though he meant to bury her within his very frame.

"Ugh..." she exhaled a stifled gasp, fighting for air.

Vincent's chin pressed down against the crown of her head. His chest rose and fell with uneven force. "You had better not have tried to run," he whispered in a lowN, menacing growl.

Inside, Hannah's laughter was icy, but outwardly, she didn't resist-she remained still. She angled her head slightly, chin resting against his chest, her voice muffled yet edged with playful defiance. "Since you don't trust me, what about l attempt torun away now for you to see?"

"Don't you dare!" The words came out almost as a snarl, his arms tightening like steel bands. "Hannah, don't even think about it."

He allowed no reply. Breaking the embrace, he caught her wrist once again-unyielding-and dragged her toward the supermarket exit. His stride was swift. Burning.

Hannah dropped her gaze, veiling the glimmer of frozen contempt in her eyes. The harsher his grip became, the more she longed to wrench herself free. Following the supermarket turmoil, life within the secluded estate resumed its ordinary tranquility.

Hannah wasn't confined strictly to the suite, her movement expanding to the estate's shared spaces.

But one shift was evident-Vincent began showing himself more often.

Previously, he returned merely for dinner without fail,though at times, work obligations or late appointments delayed him.Now, however, he had started returning for lunch as well,nearly every day

Hannah betrayed no outward response, but she grasped the truth-Vincent fretted she might run again. Surveillance shadowed her constantly. Her attempt to locate her mother had grown far more difficult. But she uncovered one place that might conceal the answers she sought. Vincent's study.

That day, after lunch, Vincent left the estate as usual for something about a vital international engagement.

Hannah lingered by the tall windows, though her mind rested solely on that study. This was a rare opening. She rose unhurriedly, composed, and strolled casually toward the study.

As her hand stretched for the brass knob, the butler's voice broke the stillness from behind her.′′Mrs. Jones, are you trying to enter the study?"

Hannah didn't waver. Her reply was light, as though the notion were an idle fancy. "Yes, I only hoped to find a book on orchid care. I assumed there could be one in there."

The courteous smile of the butler, Alfred Penrose, didn't falter.Polite as always. Deferential as ever. "Mrs. Jones, I am afraid that you couldn't get in. Mr. Jones left explicit orders-no one is permitted into the study without his approval."
###Chapter 378 Genuinely Angry
Hannah's gaze hardened in an instant, turning cold as ice."Vincent sees me as his wife. The mistress of this estate. Is there any part of this house I am not allowed to go to?"

Alfred's polished smnile flickered, slipping for the briefest second before he recovered. He bowed slightly, his voice calm but edged with firmness. "Please don't be upset, Mrs. Jones.These were Mr. Jones's direct instructions."

Her lips curved into a sharp, mocking smile. "And what if I insist on going into this study?"

She no longer spared the butler a glance. Her eyes fixed squarely on the study door.

"Please, Mrs. Jones. Don't put me in a difficult position," Alfred pleaded, urgency breaking through his composed tone.

But before he could say more, Hannah pivoted, hand pressing down on the cold brass door handle of the study.

Click. The lock gave way, and the study door swung open.

"Apologies," she said coolly. "But I'm going in today. And that's not up for debate."

"Mrs. Jones, please! You can't-" Alfred's face blanched, panic flashing across his features as he rushed forward.

But Hannah was quicker. She slipped inside. Bang! The door slammed shut, locking from the inside with a sharp twist.

"You can tell Vincent yourself." Her voice rang out from behind the wooden door, steely and unyielding.Inside, her eyes swept the study. The desk sat in perfect order,with only a handful of documents resting neatly on the surface.

Without hesitation, she pulled the drawers open. As expected,a black folder lay inside, stuffed with detailed records of private rehabilitation facilities. Names. Addresses. Descriptions.Everything was laid out in painstaking detail. Her mother had to be in one of them.

Her eyes raced across the pages, committing every crucial detail to memory. Then, just as swiftly, she slid the folder back into place and shut the drawer.

Outside, Alfred knocked frantically. "Mrs. Jones, please open the door. If you don't, we'll have to take strong measures."

He wasn't standing guard with bodyguards for nothing-he feared she might attempt an escape. If she caused any trouble,there would be no way to explain it to V/incent.

Hannah drew in a steadying breath, smoothing her expression as though nothing had happened. Grabbing a few technical books from the shelves, she tucked them into her arms. Then,without hesitation, she walked to the door and unlocked the door with a sharp click.

The door swung open.

Outside, Alfred's face had gone pale, a sheen of sweat beading on his temple. Noting that she hadn't taken long and was indeed holding a stack of books, he bit back his words. But later, he reported the entire incident to Vincent in painstaking detail.



Dinner that evening carried a heaviness-thick, strained, and quiet.

Vincent's voice broke the silence, calm yet deliberate. "You
Vincent's voice broke the silence, calm yet deliberate."You went into the study today?"

Hannah's fingers tightened imperceptibly around her fork.There it was-the question she'd been expecting. No matter.She had already rehearsed her answer.

Meeting his gaze without flinching, she spoke evenly. "Yes. I was looking for a few reference books."

Vincent's eyes lingered on her, narrowing just slightly."If you need something, you can ask the butler. He knows the study better than anyone."

At that, Hannah set her fork down with a sharp clink. Her head lifted, eyes flashing with indignation. "Vincent, let's get one thing straight. Am I your prisoner?"

His expression remained composed, but something faint flickered in his gaze. "No," he answered quietly.

"No?" Hannah pushed back her chair and shot to her feet, the scrape of wood against polished floor cutting harshly through the silence. "Then why does it feel like I am?" she demanded."In this house, I'm watched like a criminal. I can't even step into the study for a book without being stopped! The butler blocked me, and the guards followed me everywhere. I tried to read something useful for tending to some flowers, and I have to get your permissions first?"

Her voice wavered, trembling with emotion as her eyes reddened, the display raw yet carefuly controlled. "If that's how it is, you might as well just lock me back in that suite for good! Keep me there all day, every day. And when we have a child someday, I'll just raise it in those four walls-like a pet in a cage!"

The words hung in the air like a blade, and while her tone brimmed with outrage, she was watching-calculating-gauging his every flicker of reaction. She had to play it this way. This his every flicker of reaction. She had to play it this way. This moment was crucial. She couldn't let him grow suspicious.

Without another word, she turned on her heel and strode out of the dining room-head high, shoulders squared, not once glancing back.

Silence swallowed the dining room whole.

Vincent sat motionless, gaze fixed ahead, though beneath the calm, something turbulent rippled. Was she genuinely angry?Why such a fierce reaction? It almost seemed as though she genuinely felt this place was home.

And actually, he didn't care much for her docile compliance. It was this fire, this defiance, that made her feel alive. It reminded him of how things used to be, back when they were still husband and wife.
###Chapter 379 She Had To Perform This Act To...
Late that night, the suite door creaked open once more.Vincent stepped inside.

On the bed, Hannah lay curled on her side, the thin blanket pulled only to her waist. She didn't stir, her breathing steady,appearing to be fast asleep.

Vincent crossed the room to the bed, lifted the covers, and slipped in beside her.

The mattress dipped beneath his weight. For once, he didn't reach for her-he only lay there, staring at the ceiling.

The silence pressed in, broken only by the rhythm of their breathing.

Of course, Hannah was wide awake. Her thoughts churned. Her earlier charade in the dining room wasn't finished yet. If she wanted his trust, she had to sell this.

With a sudden roll, she turned toward him, irritation flashing across her face. She angrily asked,"What are you doing here?""I'm still mad at you."

"To sleep," he muttered, his voice low and heavy with exhaustion.

"To sleep?" Her tone cracked, sharp with hurt. "That's it? After everything I told you at dinner-you're just going to brush it off like nothing?"

Vincent said nothing. His gaze held hers, even in the dark-sharp, unyielding, as though he were trying to unearth her most hidden thoughts. A long moment passed.

Then, finally, he exhaled. "From now on," he said slowly, "you can move around this place as you please. As long as you don't try to escape."

That was his bottom line.

Hannah's chest tightened. Her plan worked. Relief surged,though she forced her expression to stay tense, brimming with wounded indignation. "If I really wanted to run away," she shot back, her voice trembling with emotion, "I could've done it at the supermarket. It was chaos. People everywhere. I had the perfect chance." Her words cracked, teetering on the edge of a sob.

She leaned closer, her breath brushing the side of his neck."But I didn't. In all that, didn't you notice anything?"

Vincent went rigid. His breath hitched. "Notice what?" His voice was taut,guarded.

Hannah's pulse raced. This was it-the moment to disarm him completely.

She lowered her gaze, lashes fluttering as though weighed down with hesitation and embarrassment. Her fingers curled around the corner of his pajama shirt. "I didn't run... because l couldn't bear to leave you," she whispered. "And also..."

She lifted her gaze, locking onto his eyes. "I still like you."

Was she really confessing her feelings to him? This hit Vincent like a blow. She said she couldn't bear to leave him. She said she still liked him.

Without thinking, he leaned in, closing the distance between them in a heartbeat. Their breaths collided-ragged, uneven."Do you mean your words?" he asked, his voice low, almost desperate.Hannah knew she couldn't show a hint of hesitation. She had to perform this act to perfection. Without a word, she swung one leg over and straddled him in a single, fluid motion.

Then, she leaned down and kissed him. It was soft,fleeting-just the brush of lips.

She drew back a little, though her body stayed pressed against his. Her breathing turned uneven, and her eyes glimmered with playful reproach."What do you think? After everything we've been through, how could I possibly feel nothing for you? Do you really believe I'm made of stone? Plus, you were my first love. Even the coldest heart would have warmed by now."

Her tone carried convincing tenderness and sincerity, but it was all a performance. Every word she spoke was carefully chosen for effect.

But Vincent believed her. Entirely. He tumbled headlong into the illusion of her supposed love, unwilling-and unable-to resist its pull.

In a sudden rush, his hand clamped firmly around the back of her neck, while his other arm cinched tight around her slender waist. He was no longer simply receiving her kiss; he was consuming it.

Mouths collided. Breaths tangled. What followed was inevitable -like a wildfire that had only needed a spark.

Vincent surrendered to his desire, unleashing days of restraint,suspicion, and the tidal surge of affection that had been building inside him. He was relentless-at times tender,at others fierce and consuming-as though he wanted to fuse her into his very bones.

Hannah endured it all, letting him take her. She moaned softly in response, her eyes dazed, as if lost in the moment. Yet beneath the facade, she remained detached and calculating. Time slipped away in a blur.

At last, he stopped.

Hannah lay drained, unable to lift even a finger. Every muscle ached.She stayed still with her eyes closed, looking for all the world as if she had already drifted into sleep.

Vincent rose, moving with care so as not to disturb her.He gently scooped her into his arms and carried her into the bathroom. With quiet, deliberate tenderness, he wiped her down, every gesture unhurried and precise. When he was done,he brought her back to bed, laying her gently against the pillows before pulling the covers snug around her shoulders.

He stretched out beside her, watching in silence as she lay there, eyes closed, breathing softly. This-this was the moment he had longed for. The moment she finally lowered her guard and stopped resisting or pushing him away.He had waited fa too long for this.

Reaching into the drawer of the nightstand, his fingers found a small velvet box. Inside rested a ring. He opened it slowly,reverently, and slid it onto her finger with steady hands. They would get married again soon. Everything would fall back into place,just as it was meant to be. She would be his wife-and his alone.
###Chapter 380 Turning Down His Proposal
Morning light streamed softly through the windows as Hannah stirred awake. Her body throbbed with a deep ache, as if it had been taken apart and pieced back together. Every muscle felt sore, especially around her waist and legs.

She frowned faintly and raised a hand to massage her pounding temples.

Then, she noticed it. A ring-on her left hand. Not the one Vincent had previously proposed with. This was a different ring entirely.

A flawless, pear-shaped diamond, easily over ten carats,glittered on her finger. It was dazzling. Extravagant. Impossible to ignore.

Hannah's eyes widened with shock. Vincent must have slipped it on while she was asleep.

Just then, the door opened. Vincent stepped in, already dressed, every detail of his appearance meticulously in place.

He crossed the room and leaned over her, planting his hands on either side of her, his gaze burning into hers. "Not wanting to sleep a bit longer?"

Snapping out of her daze, Hannah quickly adopted a soft,playful look, just the right touch of coyness in her expression.She lifted her left hand-the one with the ring-and tapped the front of his neatly buttoned suit. "Vincent, you didn't even propose. You just went ahead and put the ring on me?" Her tone carried a trace of measured complaint.

Vincent caught her hand gently but didn't answer right away  Vincent caught her hand gently but didn't answer right away Instead,before she could fully process what was happening,he lowered himself to one knee beside the bed

His tall figure bent down, his eyes level with hers. He held her left hand-the one with the glittering diamond-and looked at her steadily. "Hannah Scott,marry me."

For a heartbeat, she froze. She felt as though she had been transported back in time to a more innocent and youthful version of herself, the girl who used to gaze at him with hopeful eyes.

But the memory vanished as quickly as it came, replaced by a sharper, colder clarity. So, he was serious about proposing.Perfect. On the day he threw a formal proposal party,she would run.

Donning a touched expression, she softened her voice into a whisper tinged with discontent. "Who proposes like this? First thing in the morning, in the bedroom? Really?"

She attempted to pull her hand away. But he gripped it tighter.

"| couldn't wait," Vincent said quietly, urgency threading through his voice.

"Well, I can." She finally slipped her hand from his grasp, her tone turning serious. "If you're really going to propose, then l want it done properly. I really worked hard when I proposed to you back then. I spelled your name with drones. I had roses ready."

She straightened her posture and met his gaze. "I poured my heart into it. I don't want you to treat me carelessly. That is unfair."

Then,she reached for the ring and slipped it off her finger,setting it on the nightstand. "This doesn't count," she said firmly. A shadow flickered across Vincent's face. He stayed on one knee, his expression shifting, eyes clouded with conflicting emotions.

Hannah, however, pretended not to notice. She leaned forward slightly, her gaze steady. "Vincent," she muttered, "I hope you know what I desire. When you deliver what I am asking for, I'll say yes."

He stared at her, unable to tell if she was simply stalling or if she truly meant what she said about wanting the proposal to matter.

Silence spread between them like a slow, creeping fog.

Moments later, Vincent rose to his feet. He grabbed Hannah's wrist, picked up the ring from the nightstand, and slid it back onto her finger.

"Wear it," he said in a low voice. It was as if only with that ring on her hand could he believe she belonged to him

He clamped down on her wrist. "The proposal... I'll plan it," he added roughly. "But until then, you need to wear this."

His hold was so firm that it hurt. Hannah caught the fire of possessiveness burning in his eyes and scoffed inwardly.Outwardly, though, her expression softened. Lowering her gaze to hide the calculation in her eyes, she spoke with calm resolve."I can wear it. But without a real proposal, I won't say yes."

Her voice dropped lower. "I won't relive what happened before.Back then, no one knew I was your wife, and people assumed was only your kept woman. I endured it once-l won't go through it again. I want the proposal I deserve. And a proper wedding. Public, grand, and undeniable. I won't settle forless."

Her expression shifted to faint sadness, the perfect touch of pain playing across her features, as though those memories still cut deep.Vincent noticed the change in her face, and something inside his chest twisted. That failed marriage-the scars it had left-still haunted her. She couldn't let it go. He brushed his thumb across the ring now resting on her finger, his voice softening."| understand."

Yet deep down, uncertainty gnawed at him. Did she truly long for the grand proposal? His instincts whispered suspicion.
###Chapter 381 Infertility

Since the day Hannah turned down his proposal, Vincent avoided bringing up the topic again. It appeared as though he had completely erased it from his thoughts.

Nevertheless, Hannah frequently caught sight of him scrolling through information connected to venues on his tablet during the evenings. She assumed he was probably making preparations.

Also, she noticed another significant change in Vincent lately -he no longer enforced rigid restrictions on her movements.Right now, she could wander freely through every part of the estate as she pleased.

When she brought up the idea of visiting the hospital for a routine examination, Vincent's initial response was not refusal but an offer to accompany her there. It seemed he was gradually changing.

Soon, the day of the hospital appointment arrived.

The vehicle rolled up to the hospital's VIP entrance lane.

As Vincent prepared to exit the vehicle, Hannah gently pressed her hand on his arm. "Don't you have pressing documents to attend to? Complete them here and then find me later, so your work doesn't suffer any delay."

Vincent cast a look at his wristwatch and then at the encrypted documents awaiting review, his brow knitting slightly. He did need to review an emergency plan for a cross-border merger.

Still, he hesitated as the idea of Hannah going inside the hospital alone didn't sit well with him.

Seeing this, Hannah suggested, "Then how about dispatching Seeing this,Hannah suggested, "Then how about dispatching two bodyguards to accompany me?"

"Alright." He finally nodded, turning to the two bodyguards.He did need to review an emergency plan for a cross-border merger.

"Yes," the two bodyguards replied respectfully with a bow.

Vincent then returned his gaze to Hannah, his expression unwavering. "I will join you once I finish."

"Alright," Hannah answered, a tender smile curving on her lips.

Dedicated personnel guided them through the private VIP passage. The registration and preliminary procedures were swift and discreet.

"Ms. Scott, kindly come with me. The gynecology assessment is located in Room 3," a nurse stated cheerfully as she led the way.

Hannah inclined her head and followed after the nurse into the examination chamber.

The two bodyguards, keeping Vincent's command in mind,attempted to step inside as well.

But the nurse held them back. "Gentlemen, this chamber is a confidential medical area. Male visitors are prohibited.Please remain in the waiting section outside."

Hannah quickly added, "Wait outside. The examination won't take long."

Ultimately, the two bodyguards stationed themselves before the door.

Inside the examination room, Hannah fiddled with her fingers,her nerves fraying. Her period had been overdue by nearly ten full days, something unprecedented for her. She feared thefull days, something unprecedented for her. She feared the possibility of being pregnant. This was the reason for this hospital visit-to obtain certainty.

Darby Gonzalez, a firm-faced physician in her forties,furrowed her brow slightly while examining the laboratory results on her monitor. "Ms. Scott," she said, raising her eyes with calm professionalism, "based on your blood HCG values and ultrasound images, you are not pregnant."

Hannah almost reflexively exhaled in relief- the oppressive burden weighing upon her chest immediately dissolved. Not pregnant! What a blessing!

"However..." Darby adjusted her spectacles, her demeanor shifting into deeper gravity as she examined Hannah's medical records. "You experienced a miscarriage with severe bleeding,correct? And before, that, you had long been consuming contraceptive medication, right?"

Before the divorce, Hannah had been drugged with contraceptives by Danica. Not long after she'd discovered it and avoided any more intake, she had been conceived. Yet,shortly after, she had suffered a miscarriage due to a hemorrhage.

Hannah didn't deny it and nodded. "Yes, both are true."

Darby sighed, her tone carrying a hint of pity. "That explains.The miscarriage inflicted severe damage to your uterus,intensified by the influence of the long-time intake of contraceptives... Your condition is extremely grave. You are facing infertility. The likelihood of natural conception is exceedingly slim."

Darby's words rang clearly in Hannah's ears. Her feelings surged with heavy conflict. Although she had never wished-and even dreaded-the thought of bearing a child with Vincent, she had never foreseen being told she was infertile. Without realizing it, she rested her hand upon her flat abdomen.She might never experience motherhood. Vincent desired a child to shackle her, but in reality, she could not provide one at all. How bitterly ironic.

The immense shock left her momentarily dazed, but soon,deeper doubts surfaced. "Then what has caused my period to be delayed so long?"

Darby studied her expression sympathetically. "Based on your test results, it's primarily due to excessive stress and psychological strain, disrupting your endocrine balance. I can prescribe some medication to stabilize your menstrual rhythm,but it is important you relax, establish steady routines, and steer clear of excessive pressure-"

"I don't think I require the medication," Hannah cut in firmly.She had indeed come for a health assessment, but her true purpose was to obtain a fabricated pregnancy confirmation.

She had thought it through-since Vincent yearned for a child,she would give him exactly what he longed for. Of course, an illusion. She would exploit this "pregnancy" to secure his trust even further.

Darby was startled by the sudden shift in Hannah's demeanor and froze. "Why? Are you taking other medication?"

Leaning closer, Hannah lowered her voice, speaking swiftly and with resolve. "I need your cooperation-produce a pregnancy test report affirming that I am expecting."
###Chapter 382 A Classmate From College
"What? Absolutely not!" Darby nearly shot upright from her chair, her tone spiking in alarm before she forced it down,abruptly aware of the gravity of the moment. "Ms. Scott,forging medical files is a serious breach of both the law and professional integrity. It's a crime!"

Hannah's stare held steady. If anything, it hardened. She drew a card from the inner lining of her purse and slid it beneath the folder in front of Darby. "Money is no obstacle. This card is unregistered, limitless, and valid worldwide. What it holds is more than enough for your entire family to relocate abroad and live among the upper class forever."

Darby's eyes darted between the card and Hannah, beads of clammy sweat forming on her brow. "What exactly do you expect me to do? This... This is unlawful and immoral. I won't do it!"

"Calm yourself-it harms no one." Hannah lowered her lashes,her features tinged with the faint ache of resignation, the mask of a daughter-in-law oppressed in an affluent clan."|only need to silence my mother-in-law. Life in a rich household isn't nearly as glamorous as it looks. Without a child, my footing is unstable. She hounds me every day, and my husband treats me with disdain. I just need a short reprieve, a facade of pregnancy, to hold my place. Nothing more."

The reasoning carried weight, drawing pity for a young wife crushed by domestic expectations.

Darby's worries and resistance faltered, but the risk still loomed.Her hand clenched hard around the pen. "The risk is enormous.If this ever comes out, my career is over..." "It won't come out." Hannah's reply was unwavering, her gaze cutting."All I need is an ultrasound and an HCG blood analysis that shows I'm roughly two weeks pregnant. Issue them as you would any routine report. The scan can be blurred, the HCG slightly elevated-nothing suspicious."

Watching Darby hesitate, Hannah softened her pitch. "Please help me this once. Afterward, you'll no longer need your monthly salary to support your family--you'll finally get to live the life you've dreamed of."

Darby's expression faltered. "You... You guarantee this won't be tied to anything illegal? That no one will get hurt? And if it fails, it can't lead back to me!"

"I guarantee it," Hannah answered with conviction.

At last, Darby turned to the screen and began creating a false pregnancy report.

Moments later, Hannah held a fabricated report in her hand.She stepped out of the examination room. With two guards flanking her, she moved toward the lift.

Just then, a voice, oily and taunting, cut across the corridor."Well, if it isn't Silverwvood University's prom queen-Hannah."

Hannah froze mid-step, her eyes hardening into frost. That voice was unforgettable. Turning, she saw her college classmate, Gareth Barnes.

Gareth had been the classic playboy, flaunting family money and pursuing Hannah obsessively during college days. When she'd rejected him politely, he'd retaliated with spiteful rumors.

Later on, when Hannah had married Vincent, Gareth had sneered openly that she'd be discarded before long. Right now, as Gareth ambled toward her, Hannah only longed to sweep past without a glance. But he planted himself in front weep past without a glance. But he planted himself in front of her, barring the way. "Well, it's been a while." He clicked his tongue, his tone thick with scorn. "Heard things haven't been treating you kindly these days?"

His eyes darted toward the guards at her back. "What's this?Mr. Jones scared you'll bolt? Orworried someone else might snatch you away? Need assistance from me, your classmate?Maybe you don't dazzle like you once did, but hey, you were still the prom queen back then..."

He laughed, plucked a gold-edged card from his crocodile wallet, and dangled it between two fingers right before her face with insufferable arrogance. "Go on, take it. I'm thriving now. If you ever stumble, don't hesitate to lean on me. I've always been generous to old acquaintances-especially beautiful ones like you."
###Chapter 383 A Married Woman
To Gareth's surprise, Hannah actually took the business card from his hand.

A flicker of triumph shot through Gareth. He thought she'd finally accepted reality and was ready to yield, and his grin stretched wider.

But without sparing him a glance, Hannah lowered her eyes at the business card and read aloud, her voice dripping with mockery. "Everest Materials Co., Ltd.. Serously? You dare flaunt a tiny workshop like this in front of me?"

Her scorn hung in the air, sharp and deliberate.

Gareth froze, the smile on his face stiffening. "You-"His complexion darkened with rage and humiliation. "Hannah Scott,who do you think you are? Do you still think you're the prom queen everyone admired? Look at you now-you're nothing but Vincent's cast-off-"

Smack! The card flicked from Hannah's hand and smacked Gareth squarely across the mouth.

Before he could react, her high heel shot forward, slamming into his bloated stomach.

The kick wasn't brutal, but it landed with cruel precision,sending his bulky frame stumbling backward.

Clutching his belly, Gareth let out a strangled roar. "How dare you hit me? I'll make you regret this!"

He lunged at her, but Hannah merely shifted back, her movements calm, almost lazy. With the slightest tilt of her chin, movements calm, almost lazy. With the slightest tilt of her chin,she signaled to the two bodyguards behind her.

The bodyguards stepped forward at once, pinning Gareth with ease.

"Mrs. Jones," one of the bodyguards called, awaiting her instructions.

Hannah pulled out a handkerchief, wiping the fingers that had touched his business card, her face twisted in disgust. Her lips curved as she said coldly, "That hand of his... It's far too unruly.Break it."

"Yes."

Crack! The sound was sickening. Gareth's wrist bent at a grotesque angle.

"Ah! My hand! My hand!" Gareth's scream tore through the hallway as he crumpled to the floor. "Hannah! You vile witch!You'll pay for this! I'll curse you till you die!" he spat,raving through the pain.

The commotion drew a new voice.

"Oh my! What's going on here? Honey! Honey, are you hurt?"Clarissa Barnes, Gareth's wife, rushed forward, her face stricken.

A sharp gleam flickered in Hannah's eyes. Perfect. She needed Vincent here. She turned slightly to one of the bodyguards."Go tell Vincent I'm being harassed at the hospital."

Her meaningful gaze swept over Gareth, still writhing on the floor, before sliding to Clarissa, who looked ready to hurl herself at her.

The bodyguard paused and then nodded. "Understood."

Clarissa dropped beside her husband, aghast at his twisted wrist.Then, she leapt up, finger jabbing at Hannah as she shouted,
Then, she leapt up, finger jabbing at Hannah as she shouted,"You shameless tramp! Couldn't lure my husband, so you had him beaten up instead? Is there no justice left?Oh-Irrecognize you now. I saw you in his graduation photos. You were the notorious slut back then, and marriage hasn't changed you one bit!"

Hannah didn't even blink as if the insults rolled off her. She watched Clarissa with cool disdain and then let out a cold,dismissive laugh. "You know, not everyone has terrible taste like you. Look at your husband-bloated, greasy, reeking of sweat. Do you honestly believe I'd waste even a glance on him?What's supposed to attract me-the stench, the fat, or that sleazy face of his?"

Hannah's words sliced deep, silencing Clarissa.Red-faced,she trembled with humiliation as the crowd around them snickered,their gazes on Gareth dripping with contempt.

Then, Hannah's tone softened, almost tender. "Besides, I'm a married woman. My husband is a thousand times the man your pathetic one could ever hope to be."

That was the line Vincent heard as he strode into the scene
###Chapter 384 They Dared To Offend My Wife
 Vincent's brow gave the faintest twitch, betraying an emotion he rarely allowed anyone to see. It was the first time since their divorce that he had heard Hannah refer to him as her "husband." The sudden acknowledgement flickered through him like a spark-so brief that he almost questioned whether he'd imagined it.

Clarissa, her whole body quivering with fury at Hannah's biting words, jabbed a shaking finger in her direction. "Who the hell do you think you are? Sleeping your way through men to survive, and even after marriage, you still can't change your ways. Always whoring after somebody else's husband!"

From the floor, Gareth glared at Hannah and groaned through clenched teeth, his face twisted in pain, yet he still forced words out. "My wife is right. You're only jealous of us-jealous of our perfect marriage. You're nothing but used-up trash. If Mr. Jones knew the kind of woman you really are, he'd toss you out without a second thought."

"Enough!" Vincent's voice sliced through the chaos like a blade,deep and resonant with authority.

The room went still. Every pair of eyes tracked him as he advanced, each measured step carrying a quiet, deliberate weight that silenced the air around him.

Gareth's sobs cut off at once, dread tightening his chest. Why on earth had Vincent shown up?

In an instant, Vincent was at Hannah's side, drawing her firmly into his arms. "Are you alright? Did they lay a hand on you?"

With a practiced tremor in her voice, Hannah leaned into him.  With a practiced tremor in her voice, Hannah leaned into him."I'm fine. But Gareth just gave me his business card and suggested I become his mistress."

Vincent's eyes iced over as they locked on Gareth.

Clarissa's fury exploded. She seized Gareth by the ear,jerking it hard. "Unbelievable! You actually think you can keep another woman behind my back?"

Panic-stricken, Gareth clawed for excuses. "No, darling! I swear,it's not like that. You're the only woman I want-please,believe me!"

Clarissa's grip finally loosened, though her glare remained lethal. "We'll deal with this at home," she snapped and then turned sharply back toward Vincent and Hannah.

Clarissa acknowledged that the moment demanded that she stand beside her husband, no matter her rage. Her envy over Hannah having such a strikingly handsome husband faded momentarily as she fixed all her energy on demanding justice.

Clarissa pointed at Hannah and scowled at Vincent.′′SO,,you're her husband, huh? Then tell me-how do you intend to address that your wife broke my husband's wrist?"

Vincent's expression darkened, his voice cold and clipped as he gave a curt order to the bodyguards. "Throw these damn fools out-they're such a nuisance!"

"Got it, Mr. Jones!" The bodyguards immediately moved in to carry out his command.

"What? Mr. Jones, please, have mercy! This is nothing but a misunderstanding!" Gareth cried in panic, his face contorted with pain as he clutched his injured wrist and struggled against the guards. Fear twisted in his gut-he knew this wasn't only about being tossed out. A savage beating might follow.

Clarissa, though shaken, clung to her defiance. "And why  Clarissa, though shaken, clung to her defiance. "And why exactly should we leave? What right do you have to throw us out? Does this hospital belong to you? Your damn wife tried to seduce my husband, and when that failed, she had those men in black break his wrist. And now we can't even speak up?"

The uproar grew so loud that it drew the hospital director himself.

Seizing the chance, Gareth collapsed dramatically, clutching his stomach and rolling on the floor with pitiful howls. "Ah! It hurts so bad! Director, please help us! They're bullying us, trying to drag us out! That woman even had someone break my wrist!"

Clarissa hurried over, jabbing her finger toward Vincent and Hannah. "Director, thank goodness you arrived in time! l demand to file a complaint against them! That man and his wife are forcing us out. We're business partners with this hospital.You have to stand up for us!"

The director's face tightened, his demeanor instantly shifting from stern to reverent the moment his gaze landed on Vincent.He all but jogged forward and bent low in a deep bow, leaving the entire room frozen in disbelief. His voice carried the weight of both respect and unease. "Mr. Jones, what an unexpected honor. Please, allow me to escort you. I've already had the best refreshments prepared for your visit."

Vincent's voice cut through the room, low and relentless."That won't be necessary. Those two dared to offend my wife.Take care of it."

Vincent's gaze swept over Gareth and Clarissa with the same disdain one might reserve for garbage tossed on the street.

The director stiffened and instantly bowed his head, eager to show his allegiance. "Right away, Mr. Jones. I'll sever our partnership with them without delay."

"Hold on!" A piercing shriek tore from Clarissa's throat. Her Hold on!" A piercing shriek tore from Clarissa's throat. Her face went deathly pale as dread closed in around her. Their family business supplied medical equipment to this hospital,and today's visit with Gareth had been meant to seal the final deal.Instead,everything was unraveling before her eyes.

"Director!" Clarissa pleaded, her voice cracking under panic."You can't do this! The agreements are already finalized. My father has the contracts ready for signing. How can you just tear it all apart now?"

Gareth's panic deepened, his throat tightening as the weight of the collapsing deal sank in. This agreement had been his company's lifeline, and if it unraveled, ruin was inevitable."Director, it's all a misunderstanding! Mr. Jones, Mrs. Jones-we're so sorry! We didn't realize who we were dealing with.Please,forgive us!"

The director didn't so much as spare them a glance, his loyalty firmly nailed to Vincent's side. "Serve you right for offending Mrs. Jones. He's the top investor in our hospital."

All color drained from Clarissa's and Gareth's faces. Their earlier arrogance dissolved, leaving only raw terror as they collapsed to their knees. Clarissa pleaded frantically, "Mr. Jones,Mrs. Jones, we've learned our lesson! Please, spare us just this once!"

Gareth's words broke apart in a strangled sob. "Mrs. Jones,it was my fault. I spoke recklessly. Please, I beg you,show mercy!"

Hannah stepped forward, her lashes lowering as she regarded them with cool detachment. "You want my forgiveness? That isn't entirely impossible."
###Chapter 385 Not Satisfied

Hannah's words made Clarissa and Gareth snap their heads up,a flicker of desperate hope flashing in their eyes.

But Hannah's voice remained flat, glacial, utterly stripped of mercy. "However, you still need to take responsibility for spreading rumors and slandering me."

Clarissa bobbed her head frantically. "Yes, yes-we'll take responsibility! Mrs. Jones, whatever you want us to do, we'll do it!"

Hannah's gaze lingered on Clarissa and Gareth, cool and unblinking. Then, the corner of her lips curled into a razor-sharp smile. "Alright then. Since the two of you seem so inseparable-such a loving couple-why don't you prove it?Slap each other. Right here."

The blood drained from Clarissa's and Gareth's faces in an instant. Slapping each other? In front of this many people?

Hannah tilted her head, her tone laced with biting mockery."What's wrong? Not willing? Then I suppose your apology isn't all that sincere."

She shifted slightly, as if ready to walk away.

"We'll do it! We'll doit!" Clarissa shrieked, panic cracking her voice. She shot to her feet and, without a second's hesitation,swung her arm back. Her palm cracked against Gareth's cheek with every ounce of strength she could muster.

The sharp smack echoed through the room. Caught completely off guard, Gareth's head snapped to the side.He staggered, clutching his stinging cheek, eyes wide with disbelief."Clarissa! Are you out of your damn mind? You actually hit me?" "What-you think I wanted to?" Clarissa fired back, her voice trembling with fury and humiliation.

Gareth's eyes went blood-red. He roared, raised his hand, and slapped her across the face just as hard.

"Gareth! You dare hit me?" Clarissa screamed, launching herself at him like a wildcat.

"Damn right I dare! You bitch!" Gareth bellowed, losing what little self-control he had left.

The two of them erupted into an all-out brawl-slaps flying,nails scratching, curses ripping through the air. The room exploded into chaos.

Even the hospital security guards and the director froze, too stunned by the sheer absurdity of the scene to step in.

And through it all, Hannah watched in silence, her expression perfectly calm, as if none of it touched her in the slightest.She'd seen enough.

Turning away, Hannah glanced at Vincent and murmured,"1′S too noisy. Let's go."

"Alright." He reached for her hand and led her out.



The car wound its way back to the estate.

When Hannah stepped into the main hall, she stopped dead in her tracks.

The place was unrecognizable. What had once been cold and austere now shimmered with warmth and romance.

Golden roses-her favorite-covered every corner, their petals catching the soft candlelight. On the marble floor, candles had been arranged in the shape of a heart, flickering gently.

Servants stood in perfect rows on either side, each holding an elegantly wrapped gift box. All these presents were for Hannah.

Hannah moved forward quietly, accepting the gifts one by one.

Vincent didn't take his eyes off Hannah. He studied every flicker of emotion across her face, every hesitation in her step.His voice carried a trace of anticipation."Do you like it? I had all of this prepared for you."

Hannah finally lifted her head, meeting his gaze. Her tone was cool,puzzled. "This is where you're planning to propose? Just here,inside the estate?"

Vincent's brows drew together."Yes."

He hesitated and then asked again, his voice lower, heavier,"Do you like it?"

"No." The word fell from her lips without a moment's pause.

The air seemed to crack. Vincent's face darkened, his deep-set eyes clouded with raw frustration. "Hannah, is there nothing I can do that will ever satisfy you?"

"That's not it." Her voice was quiet, tinged with disappointment as she held his gaze. "I thought I made myself clear last time ... I want you to value me, just like the way I once valued you.At the very least, do not propose right here. Not at home.Doing it here makes me feel like I'm not important enough to you."

"I do value you!" Vincent's voice rose, rough with frustration.He couldn't understand. He had spared no expense-world-class florists, designers, all working around the clock to transform this place for her. He thought she'd be touched,overwhelmed,convinced of his devotion. But she wasn't. "I can't feel it." Hannah's tone softened, her eyes refiecting a measured longing he had never been able to grasp. "Vincent,what I want is simple. A proposal somewhere outside,somewhere alive. Balloons, a green lawn, fireworks... just you and me. That would be enough."

"Outside?" Vincent's hands shot up, gripping her shoulders.His hold was a shade too tight, his voice low but edged with suspicion. "Do you really want a sense of ceremony...or are you just looking for a chance to escape in the middle of the proposal?" Otherwise, it didn't make sense. Why did she keep rejecting him?

Hannah flinched under the pressure of his grip. Lifting her gaze,she met his eyes with a look so raw that it cut through the air between them. "You still think I want to run away?" Her voice trembled with hurt. "Vincent, I gathered all my courage just to even consider remarrying you. All I want is a proposal with a little magic-something that fulfills the small dreams I've carried since I was a girl. But in your eyes, I'm always calculating Always ready to run..."

Her words lingered, heavy and accusing, sinking into the silence.

But Vincent's unease didn't loosen its grip on him.

They stood there, locked in a taut silence that threatened to snap at any second.

As if resisting the temptation to throw up, Hannah suddenly put a palm to her lips and hurried into the bathroom.

###Chapter 386 His Joy Knew No Bounds

Vincent's eyes narrowed abruptly. The rage and suspicion that had burned only seconds earlier vanished at once, washed away by an overwhelming flood of concern. His muscles reacted before his thoughts formed-he darted ahead like a spear hurled from a sling.

Hannah bolted into the bathroom and crashed the door shut behind her.

Vincent halted outside as Hannah hacked uncontrollably, the sound tearing through the door, each spasm so harsh that it sounded like it would tear her apart.

He hammered against the wood, raw panic roughening his tone."Unlock it! What's happening? Didn't you tell me the checkup results showed nothing?"

Inside the bathroom, Hannah twisted the faucet, letting icy water splash across her cheeks. The instant had arrived.

She inhaled deeply and pulled the door open.

Vincent's towering figure filled the frame, his features carved with alarm and bewilderment. The second he caught sight of her, he extended his hand to steady her. "What's going on?"

Hannah stepped aside, slipping out of his reach. She remained silent. With deliberate care, she drew the folded document from her pocket and passed it over.

Vincent's forehead wrinkled, his puzzlement thickening. He yanked the sheet open in haste.

As his vision darted over the words, all remnants of concern As his vision darted over the words, all remnants of concern and bafflement drained away,leaving only astonishment.

His hold clenched on the page, tendons rising on his hand.His voice emerged ragged, disbelieving. "You're expecting?"

He stared at the print repeatedly, as though unwilling to trust what he read. His eyes fixed on the line that revealed everything-two weeks pregnant.

"Yes," Hannah replied faintly, her tone weary and delicate."The doctor confirmed I'm two weeks in."

Vincent couldn't restrain himself anymore. He swept Hannah into his arms. Her feet left the floor in an instant.

"Ah!" she exclaimed in shock.

Overwhelmed with delight, Vincent even twirled her around."This is wonderful! We're going to have a child!"

This marked the first time Hannah had witnessed him lose his composure, undone by sheer bliss.

Her body felt weary from being raised, but what unsettled her more was his unguarded rapture. Her thoughts drifted to the little life that had once grown inside her for only a month.Would he have rejoiced like this if he had known about the baby's existence then?

Hannah quickly shook her head, forcing away feelings she could not permit. Now was not the moment to break.

Vincent finally stopped his spin and lowered her softly to the floor, though his arms never released her. His eyes shone with feeling, rimmed faintly red. "Hannah, I'm... truly overjoyed."

At last, the weight of unease and suspicion he had carried these recent days began to ease, soothed by the vision of this unborn child. She shifted within his arms, raising her faco toward Him. "We have a child now, Vincent. Do you still think I'll try to flee?"

His words were hushed, heavy with truth. "Forgive me.I should never have suspected you."

At this, Hannah's seemingly long-suppressed hurt finally erupted. Her eyes brimmed as she struck his chest with her fists, her voice quivering. "You always assume I'll leave-how could I not ache inside? I've been trapped here nearly a month,held like a bird in a cage. And you? You've asked me to marry you here, in this prison, not once but twice! How could you not realize why I'd feel wounded?"

She shoved him back slightly, tears trembling as she glared up at him. "And when you propose in this place, with nothing but detached servants and soulless candles, roses, and trinkets for company, who is there to witness it? How can I know if you truly wish to wed me-or if it's simply another way to bind me here forever? I can't feel safe like this. Do you understand?"

Vincent's chest throbbed as her weeping pierced him. "I'm sorry," he murmured, his voice rough. "I failed to think it through."

Deep down, he recognized that his proposals had sprung only from fear she might slip away.

"This proposal doesn't count. You must do it properly!" She shot him a fierce look. "And make it soon-| won't accept walking down the aisle with a massive belly."

She described her dream ceremony, her eyes sparkling with a feigned longing for a shared tomorrow. "I want the grandest,most breathtaking garden. The sunshine must be flawless, and the scenery unforgettable!"

"Alright. You'll have every detail you desire," Vincent promised instantly.
"And you must bring my mother and your grandmother to witness it," Hannah insisted. That had been her hidden purpose all along-to use the proposal as her chance to take her mother away with her.
###Chapter 387 The Happiest Day
From the moment the relentless watch over her subtly eased,Hannah had maintained steady communication with Claude.

Using the roster of potential institutions Hannah had handed over, Claude had eventually located Margaret inside the Mirrorlake International Wellness Center-an elite sanctuary famed for impenetrable security and uncompromising discretion.Removing anyone from there, especially a heavily guarded patient, unnoticed bordered on impossible. A direct extraction carried far too much risk. Any misstep, and Vincent would be instantly informed.

Hannah had thought it through. The sole achievable strategy was to maneuver Vincent into authorizing Margaret's release himself. This had become the silent motive threading through every act that looked "on a whim." Thestaged pregnancy, the insistence on the extravagant garden proposal-all of it served as a calculated progression, coaxing him into lowering his defenses piece by piece.

In the days that followed, Vincent immersed himself entirely in orchestrating the flawless proposal at Cloudcrest Valley. Every arrangement received his personal attention. He vowed to deliver a breathtaking surprise, one that would atone for past failings and remain etched in Hannah's memory forever.

At times, he would settle beside Hannah on the sofa,a tablet balanced in his hands, his usual stoicism melted into an almost boyish delight as he displayed sketches of floral arches and bursts of fireworks.

One afternoon, drowsiness overtook him on the sofa, the tablet slipping to the side. On the lit screen rested the finalized tablet slipping to the side. On the lit screen rested the finalized proposal itinerary.

Hannah swiftly transmitted the vital details to Claude-"Peninsula P1, Cloudcrest Valley"; "16:15, September 5";"escort Margaret to the venue."

She appended the site map and emphasized a key element."The northeast auxiliary helipad lies buried within a valley, ten minutes from Peninsula P1. It sits beyond the main surveillance grid. In seeking privacy for the proposal, Vincent barely placed guards there."

Hannah sensed that presented their single exploitable chance.

Vincent remained oblivious to all this. Because nearly every moment, Hannah lingered beside him-affectionate, obedient,flawlessly convincing. She often drew him by the hand into maternity shops, pausing among rows of pastel blue and delicate pink baby outfits, tilting her head with a smile as she asked, "Which one do you think is sweeter?"

To Vincent, that was proof. Proof that she'd embraced their future. Proof that she'd anticipated their child. Proof she had finally ceased resisting him.

With every gentle gesture from her,his suspicion weakened. He even scaled back internal monitoring within the estate, leaving only the outer perimeter under routine patrol. In his view, with a child binding them, there could be no stronger tether. She wouldn't-couldn't-leave him again.



The long-awaited day finally arrived.

On the P1 Peninsula of Cloudcrest Valley, the scene unfolded like an enchantment.

Countless ivory freesias entwined with golden roses, shaping archways and walkways drawn from a fable. A chamber group of violinists, clad in formal tuxedos,carried a soft,flowing harmony through the air.

By the water, a towering cascade of champagne sparkled under the gentle daylight, and an extravagant dessert spread stood ready for indulgence.

Among the attendees, Sharon and Danica appeared in full splendor.

Even Margaret attended. Sharon stood beside her, speaking quietly, while a nurse hovered nearby, vigilant yet restrained.

Margaret looked outwardly calm, though a faint unease flickered in her gaze.

Dressed in a deep charcoal bespoke suit, Vincent stood apart,waiting for Hannah's arrival. For the first time, nerves had unsettled him more than any tense negotiation.

Then, a whisper traveled through the gathering.

At the aisle's end, Hannah appeared. She wore a pale gold satin dress, her form poised and radiant as she advanced unhurriedly.Every step she took drew every eye.

As Hannah passed her mother, she didn't stop, but her glance conveyed a message that words could never capture.

Margaret's lips parted faintly, but silence prevailed.

At last, Hannah reached Vincent.

The violins flowed seamlessly into a warmer, more intimate refrain.

"Hannah..." Vincent's throat tightened on her name.

Before he could finish, she spoke. "I do."

Her gaze fastened on him, steady and seemingly sincere.  Her gaze fastened on him, steady and seemingly sincere."Everything you prepared today, I love it all. These past days,I've witnessed your care, the effort you've poured in. You gave me the proposal I once dreamed of. So yes, I want to marry
you."

Those two words-"| do"-meant more to Vincent than any practiced vow. All the planning, all the expectation, all the unease that had weighed on him-dispersed in one surge of elation.

She held out her hand. He gazed at it with reverence, sliding the ring onto her finger with care.

Then, before the crowd, Hannah leaned upward, framed his face in both palms, and kissed him.

It was fleeting yet indelible. A kiss that branded his lips, and deeper still-his spirit. In that instant, nothing existed but her.

He returned the kiss, deepening the bond. For the first time in years, he'd felt absolutely assured-they had a future. He,Hannah, and their unborn child-they would remain bound together forever.

This was the happiest day of his life. He just didn't realize how short-lived that happiness would be.
###Chapter 388 All A Lie

Applause swept through the hall, a warm tide of approval that made Sharon's eyes glisten. After so many obstacles, Vincent and Hannah had finally found their way back to each other.

Danica pressed her lips together, her silence laced with disapproval. Yet, she couldn't voice her objection here, and she had no choice but to stand witness. Her son always had a knack for pissing her off.

When mingling, Vincent was hemmed in by guests offering blessings and congratulations, his joy practically radiating off him.

Hannah remained close at his side, her fingers resting lightly on his arm as they moved together, graciously receiving one greeting after another.

Sharon clasped Hannah's hand, speaking to her warmly.Hannah leaned close and listened.

Danica stood off to the side, pointedly avoiding conversation.

After making the rounds with a practiced smile, Hannah gave Vincent's sleeve a subtle tug and lowered her voice. "I'm going to take my mom to the lounge. She's not used to all this noise -she seems a bit uneasy."

Vincent's spirits had been so high that he agreed right away."Of course. Don't be long," he replied with easy warmth.

Hannah gave him a gentle nod before slipping her arm through Margaret's, the two of them strolling out together.

Ten minutes ticked by.

Vincent lingered with a glass of champagne in hand, exchanging easy conversation with an older family acquaintance. As he easy conversation with an older family acquaintance. As he laughed politely at a story, his gaze strayed to his watch.Hannah was supposed to be back already.

Another ten minutes slipped past.

The smile that had been playing at Vincent's lips dimmed,unease tightening his jaw. He tuned toward the lakeside lounge,a faint crease appearing between his brows.

One of Vincent's bodyguards, standing nearby, caught on to Vincent's unease immediately, lifted a discreet comms unit, and murmured into it, "Report on Mrs. Jones's activities in the lakeside lounge."

A confused voice crackled back through the speaker. "Mrs.Jones? She hasn't come this way. I've been stationed outside the lounge from the very start of the ceremony, and I haven't caught sight of her."

Vincent's face drained of all color, leaving him ashen. His tone sliced through the soft hum of the reception. "What do you mean, you haven't seen her?"

The icy question silenced the room. The once-lively chatter collapsed into a tense hush, as though someone had muted the entire hall.

Guests exchanged uneasy glances, startled by Vincent's sudden loss of composure.

Catching the tension, the bodyguard stepped forward with urgency. "Mr. Jones, I'll deploy men to sweep the grounds right away."

Danica and Sharon locked eyes, both instantly realizing that something had gone terribly wrong.

Danica opened her mouth to interject, but Sharon's hand brushed her arm, a quiet signal. "Let him handle it," she insisted. Reluctantly, Danica bit back her words.

Within minutes, updates poured in from every checkpoint,each one reporting the same thing-no sign of Hannah.

Then,a guard from the outer perimeter burst in, chest heaving as he shouted, "Mr. Jones! Bad news! Mrs. Jones-she's making for the auxiliary helipad to the northeast. She's not alone-someone's helping her. One of our men was knocked unconscious on the trail leading there!"

Vincent staggered slightly, the floor seeming to tilt under his feet. Every seemingly tender glance from Hannah, every apparently soft smile, the warmth of her leaning into him, the anticipation of today's proposal-all of it unraveled in his mind.Was all of it a lie?

The security, the joy; the illusion of love-everything she'd given him was nothing but a carefully laid snare. She had hunted him with the patience of a predator, drawing him in step by step until he was stripped of all defenses, and only when his guard was down did she strike.

His chest tightened with disbelief. He couldn't accept it-wouldn't accept it. He had to hear the truth from her own lips.With a sharp crack, the champagne flute shattered and scattered across the floor. "Find Hannah!" he snarled,his voice ragged and burning

Bloodshot eyes blazing, Vincent surged forwvard like a storm breaking free, his bodyguards rushing to keep pace.

Panic rippled through the room as guests broke into frantic murmurs, confusion and uncertainty spreading like wildfire.Sharon and Danica hurried to quiet the crowd, their strained voices barely cutting through the chaos.



At the northeast helipad of Cloudcrest Valley, the rotor blades At the northeast helipad of Cloudcrest Valley, the rotor blades of a modified private helicopter were already whirling, slicing the night air with a piercing metallic hum.

Claude stood waiting with his men, urgency etched across his face. "Hurry up! Get on board!" he urged, motioning sharply.

Hannah steadied Margaret with a firm hand as she guided the latter toward the aircraft. Just as Margaret lifted her foot to stepinside, Hannah's gaze snapped up, her eyes narrowing

A black Cayenne burst out of the tree line, tearing through low -hanging branches before skidding violently to the very edge of the helipad, tires screaming

The car door flung open.

Claude's stomach clenched. Of course, heknew who it was-Vincent. Every nerve in his body went taut. Vincent was fast.Much too fast.

Vincent emerged from the car like a storm unchained, rage radiating off him. His bloodshot eyes found Hannah and held,burning through everything else. Forcing his fury into words, he extended a hand toward her, his voice rough and low. "Get back with me right now. I'll act as if none of this ever happened."

Hannah steadied Margaret into the helicopter and then turned back, her gaze glinting like sharpened steel. "Vincent," she said,her tone frigid and cutting, "I've torn myself apart to get this far,paid for every damn step. Do you honestly believe I'd be stupid enough to throw it all away and go back with you?"

Claude's confidence soared with Hannah's words, his voice suddenly level and commanding. "Mr. Jones, please leave. I've brought plenty of men this time. You won't be taking her away from me again."
###Chapter 389 No Child

Vincent finally pieced it together. Claude had orchestrated every detail of Hannah's escape, and she'd executed it with flawless precision, slipping away with Margaret under the cover of careful timing, unseen by a single soul. Each movement,each step, had been set into place with ruthless precision.

Vincent broke into a jagged laugh, the sound cutting through the air like shards of glass. His eyes snapped back to Hannah,raw and unblinking, his voice rasping from deep in his throat."Tell me-when did you start planning this escape?"

Hannah held his gaze without wavering, her composure unshaken. "To get away from you? That's all I've ever planned,every damn day!" she spat out.

The last flicker of hope in Vincent's eyes guttered out,leaving behind only a hard, merciless gleam. "So every word, every promise, you were lying all along."

It was no question-just a brutal truth.

"That's right." Her answer came without a pause, her voice stripped of apology, of softness. "Every soft word, every tear,every moment I leaned on you-it was all an act."

Vincent let out another laugh, sharp and hollow, a sound stripped of joy. It carried only the sting of betrayal, the bitterness of a man outplayed. "Well done, Hannah. You had me kneel in front of everyone, beg for your hand, and give you everything you asked for. All of it-just for this moment?"

Her expression remained perfectly composed, her voice steady and unshaken. "Yes. Every single part of it was deliberate-every step was planned."

Vincent's hands curled so tightly that his knuckles turned bone Vincent's hands curled so tightly that his knuckles turned bone -white, veins bulging against his skin. "Then why stop now?Why not keep the lies going? You could've chained me to you forever. You could've used the child to lock me in place. You could've had the security, the title, the life you always wanted.So why tell me the truth now?"

She didn't flinch under his fury. Her gaze held his, unyielding,her tone smooth and unhurried, like a still lake untouched by wind. "Because I'm leaving you, and I'm never coming back.That life you call love, Vincent-that gilded cage you tried to force around me-it was never mine."

Her words cut through him clean and merciless. Each syllable landed sharp and final, driving deeper than any blade. He sucked in a jagged breath, wrestling down the fury boiling inside,the suffocating crush of betrayal pressing against his chest.When he finally managed to speak, his voice dipped low,almost breaking into a plea. "Fine. You win. You've outplayed me.Satisfied?"

He closed the distance between them,every word laced with desperation, reaching for anything that might keep Wer from slipping away. "Please, Hannah, just come back with me. l swear I won't lock you down anymore. Go wherever you want,live however you want. I'll give you everything you ask for.Just.,. come back. If not for me, then at least for our baby.What about the baby? He deserves both his father and a place to belong. You can't just-"

"Baby?" Claude's voice cut in like a blade, sharp and disbelieving. His face tightened with shock as he looked at Anna. "You're pregnant?"

For the briefest moment, Claude's composure faltered. The news rocked him, leaving his expression unsettled-until the surprise hardened into a quiet, unshakable resolve. He fixed his gaze on Hannah, his words carrying a hard, certain edge. "If there's a baby, then I will help you with whatever I can. No there's a baby, then I will help you with whateverI can. No matter what comes, I'll be there. I'll be his father if you need me to."

Claude's words hit Vincent like a punch to the gut, each syllable splintering through his chest. But Hannah's brow furrowed. Her eyes slid past Vincent and landed on Claude,though her voice stayed cool, stripped of warmth. "Thank you,but my answer is no."

Turning back, she fixed Vincent with a steady, unflinching stare.Her tone sharpened, each word deliberate. "There is no child.I was never pregnant."

The revelation detonated like a bomb in the air, leaving only silence.

Vincent went rigid, as if the confession had driven a knife through his chest. His breathing hitched, jagged and uneven,and his gaze dropped to her stomach in disbelief. "How could that be? After everything and all those nights together... You must be lying."

"I'm not." Her reply struck with the clean snap of glass shattering in the cold. "You thought there was a child, Vincent,but there wasn't. That test result you saw? I paid for it-each line nothing more than the doctor's false script. From the beginning to the end, the pregnancy was nothing but a lie.Verify it yourself if you don't believe me."

Claude dragged in a sharp breath, the weight of her confession crashing over him like a wrecking ball. Even he, who thought he had accounted for every move, hadn't foreseen this twist. His eyes widened, fixed on her with a reverence that bordered on awe. "Hannah,you executed this flawlessly."

In that instant, Claude understood. Her departure wasn't a whim or a desperate gamble-it was determination written long before this moment. No matter the cost, he would get her out of here. Vincent, meanwhile, stood hollowed out, his face drained of blood and breath, stripped of everything except the raw emptiness gnawing inside him. She anchored her deception in a child that never existed to break<him completely.

The only sound left was the furious chop of helicopter bolades cleaving through the silence.

Hannah didn't glance at Vincent again-didn't look at the ruin etched into his face or the wreckage carved into his eyes. She turned with calm precision, steady in every step, and placed her hand on the cabin door. Her voice cut clean through the air, cool and final. "Claude,let's go."

Yet, Vincent's raw voice pierced the churning thunder of the helicopter. "You think you can just slip away from this? You're not done with me yet!"

In the breathless pause that followed, his fingers twitched in a small, commanding gesture.

Engines erupted, and a fleet of black SUVs screeched onto the helipad, tires spitting smoke as doors flew wide. Nearly two dozen men in body armor stormed out, snapping into a tight semi-circle. Their rifles came up in perfect unison, barrels aimed squarely at Claude's mnen without hesitation.

Claude's men snapped to meet the threat, steel flashing as their weapons locked into position, sights trained straight back.

The atmosphere grew heavy, a wire of tension stretched tight between the two sides.

Hannah's hand slid instinctively to the cold weight at her hip-the pistol Claude had pressed into her palm when they met earlier. She pulled it free in one swift, fluid motion, stepping past the line and raising the muzzle until it leveled with Vincent's chest. Her voice cut through the roar, striking like lightning against the storm. "Vincent, don't force me into this."

###Chapter 390 Over My Dead Body
Hannah fixed the weapon directly on Vincent, her stare unyielding, sharp and glacial.

The crushing certainty in her posture sent a suffocating weight into every chest.

Vincent locked onto those frozen pupils of Hannah's, his lungs tearing for air, chest heaving as if something inside him splintered apart. His glance flicked to the muzzle pointed at him,a hollow,joyless chuckle escaping. "So what's next? You gonna pull the trigger?"

Hannah's hand remained steady, not even a twitch. "I'm leaving today,Vincent. Nothing will stop me."

"And if I refuse to let you leave?" His tone sank, lethal and cutting like honed steel. He motioned.

In an instant, chaos detonated. Both factions had been strung taut like cords. At his signal, bodies burst into frenzy.

Two of Vincent's fiercest guards lunged at Claude without hesitation.

Claude's men bellowed in fury, weapons lifting as brutal melee ignited.

Shots cracked sharp and fast, yet the clash devolved into savage grappling. Blows hammered into flesh with sickening,dull resonance.

Vincent registered none of it. His sight clung only to Hannah.Through carnage, through bodies, he advanced-measured,unstoppable, carving a path with nothing but ferocity. "Don't come any closer!" Hannah's voice fractured as her hold of the pistol tightened, the barrel trembling faintly now. "I'll pull the trigger, Vincent, I swear!"

But he grinned. A ruined, twisted shape of his mouth, desperate and raw. "And what?" His rasp was shredded by mania. "Think that frightens me?"

His pace never faltered.

Ten meters.

Eight.

Her gaze widened, registering the recklessness burning inside him. This was no bluff. He wasn't gambling on her hesitation.He would seize her, whatever it cost.

Five meters.

Bang! A shot thundered, rending the air like a storm ripping the heavens apart.

For a breath, the earth forgot to move. Every fighter froze,heads snapping to the source of the sound.

Vincent's frame jolted violently, his stride breaking backward.Dark crimson spread fast across his side, staining his spotless shirt in moments. His eyes dropped to the wound and then rose,fastening on Hannah again.

A guard immediately bolted to his flank, frantic to check the damage.

Hannah's grip quaked on the pistol, faint smoke lifting from the muzzle. Her skin blanched to chalk, chest seizing, but her eyes carved like blades. Untrembling.

She had pulled the trigger only twice in her life. All because of Vincent. Once to rescue him. And once to get away from him.
Claude's chest twisted, but a shadowed grin crept onto his lips.cruelly pleased. So, her loathing for Vincent ran that deep.Excellent.

"I warned you!" Hannah's words rattled, torn and uneven. "I wasn't bluffing."

Vincent's brow gleamed with cold sweat, agony distorting his face-yet he didn't collapse. He swallowed the groan clawing at him and hauled himself upright. Shoving away the hands steadying him, he forced forward, drenched in blood. He marched still. To him, wounds meant little. Losing her-that was torment.

"Return with me." His voice was gravel, cracked and low, yet steady. It swept the helipad, hushed but unbending.

The sight of Vincent upright-bleeding, staggering, and still determined to drag Hannah back with him-left all stunned.

Hannah stared as he advanced, step by step, his steps dragging scarlet behind. Then, suddenly, she smiled. A pale curl of lips,cruel and cold, void of affection. She murmured,"Over my dead body."

The syllables had barely touched the air before Hannah acted.Without falter, she pivoted the weapon-pressing its barrel tight against her own temple.

The metal scorched her skin, heat radiating from the last round.

Her finger locked around the trigger. No quiver. No pause. And then she pressed.

"Hannah! Stop-don't!" Claude's roar tore free, frantic and guttural, terror distorting his features. He lunged instinctively,but halted mid-motion, terrified his movement might make her pull the trigger.

Vincent stopped dead in his tracks. His reddened gaze locked Vincent stopped dead in his tracks. His reddened gaze locked to her finger wound around the trigger, his plea splintering,laced with dread and rage. "Drop it! Hannah, drop the damn gun!"

Her breath came sharp and broken, knuckles whitening as she pressed harder, steel carving into her temple. "Order them to back off." Her voice cut through the rotor's howl, calm but iron -bound. "Everyone. A hundred yards. Now."

Vincent's chest heaved, each inhale shredding his side in searing pain. Yet, none of it compared to this-the unbearable torment of watching her turn the weapon on herself. "You really have to drive it this far?" he rasped,voice flayed, gutted by something worse than pain.
###Chapter 391 Escaped

"I have no alternative." Hannah's tone was disturbingly steady,her fingertip driving harder into the trigger. "Or do you honestly think I'd hesitate to fire?"

Her finger curled tighter, the muzzle pressing deeper into her own temple, leaving a shallow mark.

Vincent's chest froze solid. There was no uncertainty. She meant it.

"Fine..." Vincent gave in at last, forcing the sound past his clenched jaw as he snapped an order, "Stand down."

None of the men in black dared stall. They dropped their weapons, hauled their bleeding comrades, and rushed back toward the tree line bordering the helipad.

Moments later, the blood-smeared helipad descended into an eerie hush.

Hannah held the gun firmly against her temple, her eyes sharpened to a blade. "Claude! Move your men onto the helicopter!"

"You hop in first." Claude strode up beside her, reaching as if to take the gun from her hand.

Hannah dodged his hand, her voice slicing with absolute finality."I go last. Get them aboard, now."

Claude drew in air sharply, crushing the surge in his chest. With a harsh flick of his hand, he commanded his men, "Go! Follow her lead! Get inside!"

One after another, Claude's men clambered into the cabin.Once the finaL figure vanished inside, Claude set his foot on the Once the final figure vanished inside, Claude set his foot on the ladder. Only then did Hannah's rigid body begin to loosen-if only slightly.

At last, she let the weapon drift down from her head.Without a single glance toward Vincent, she pivoted and walked straight toward the cabin without pause.

She was just about to climb inside when Vincent's voice cut across the thunder of the rotors. "These past days..." His tone was raw, stripped bare. "Did you ever-even for one instant-mean any of it with me?" Just one moment. That was all he asked.

Hannah stilled, but she didn't turn. The rotor wash flung her hair and skirt in violent streams, yet she remained fixed.

Seconds stretched unbearably long

At last, she answered,"No."

A single word. lcy. Absolute.

She didn't stop. Didn't falter. She entered the cabin.

The helicopter lifted, blades shredding the thick air. And then,it vanished into the endless, ashen sky, leaving Vincent rooted there, emptied and broken.

The agony in his abdomen overcame Vincent. He collapsed to one knee, his voice hoarse yet commanding. "Send someone after them. At once."

"Yes."



Inside the helicopter, Hannah's gaze stayed on the clouds tearing past the window as she spoke, her voice low and unwavering. "Claude, Vincent won't drop this. The diversion helicopters... Are they in place?" Claude sat across from her, posture rigid, expression unreadable. "They're in flight," he said. "I readied four private models-same make, same design. Each heading for a separate route. Passenger sheets, flight records, tail codes-we erased everything. Even if Vincent unleashes his entire force, he'll be chasing shadows for days."

A faint chill of triumph edged his tone. "Catching us now will be like scouring a desert for a single grain."

Hannah inclined her head, unsurprised."Good."

Claude hesitated and then voiced the question he'd been holding back, "Hannah, you're not returning to Dorbarrow, are you?"

She turned, composed, answering without hesitation,"No. Not for the near future."。

He searched her features. "This is final?"

"It is." Her words carried quiet fatigue, a heaviness unshakable and final. "For now, the only thing I care about is seeing my mother recover. The injuries from the crash left complications,and I want her where she can heal in safety. And I've already taken an extended leave from the company."

At the memory-the wreck, her father's death, her mother's unending fight through pain-her chest tightened to the point of breaking.

Claude paused and then said with quiet resolve, "Then I'll remain with you. With both you and Margaret."

This time, Hannah didn't resist. Her eyes softened, just slightly,exhaustion laid bare. "All right," she whispered. "It'll help her if you're close. She trusts you."

She wasn't mistaken. Margaret had always placed faith in Claude few others earned. A month later, at a discreet clinic by the quiet coastal city in Cavendria. Margaret was beginning to resemble herself once more.With careful treatment and Hannah's unbroken care, her progress was steady.

That afternoon, Claude came to find Hannah. After a moment's silence, he spoke of Vincent, watching her closely. "I heard after Vincent was shot in the abdomen, things turned dire.Severe infection inside. He lay unconscious in intensive care for weeks."

Hannah lowered her lashes, her expression unreadable, her voice flat. "And?"

"He survived," Claude replied, tone weighted with gravity. "The word is, he regained consciousness recently. Over the past month, his men have been tearing the world apart in their search for you-relentless, obsessive, every lead exhausted,yet nothing. But now that he's awake, even confined to a hospital bed, with his will and command..." He paused, his tone sharpening. "The game shifts. His strategies. His influence. His grip. We need to prepare."

Hannah finally raised her eyes, fixing on the expanse of blue sea outside. Her tone was glacial. "I know."

She was well aware that Vincent had always been relentless.He never stopped until what he got what he wanted.

But even Hannah hadn't foreseen how fast-or how mercilessly -Vincent would strike again.
###Chapter 392 Selling Luminara
Within days of Vincent regaining consciousness and finding his voice again, Hannah's foundation in Dorbarrow-Luminara Group-came under a brutal, coordinated assault.

It started with major partners walking away from contracts.Deals unraveled overnight, penalties enforced under obscure clauses, negotiations stalled without warning.

Next came the banks. Credit ratings suddenly downgraded Loans frozen. Suppliers crowding the headquarters, demanding overdue payments.

Then, as if someone had sounded a whistle, waves of"surprise inspections" followed-tax authorities, commerce regulators,environmental officers. The company scrambled to keep up,stretched thin on every side. Fear spread through the core team;morale fractured.Headhunters circled, poaching top talent with offers that were impossible to refuse.

And then-the final strike. Competing products poured into the market, near replicas of Luminara Group's core technologies,priced deliberately to undercut. The funding behind them seemed endless. Someone had orchestrated every move.

In just two weeks, Luminara Group's stock collapsed. Market share vanished. Cash flow teetered on the edge.

Headlines filled the newsfeed: "Luminara Under Siege-Shadow Capital Forces Crash the Stock." "Founder Hannah Scott Missing Amid Alleged Fund Diversion." "Is Luminara About to Change Hands?"

Vincent's message was clear. He was dismantling everything Hannah had built, piece by piece. He wanted her cornered. He Hannah had built, piece by piece. He wanted her cornered. He wanted to force her back to Dorbarrow-his turf, his orbit, his control.

Watching one grim alert after another flash across her phone,Hannah's eyes hardened, a cold resolve settling in. "This can't go on..." she murmured.

Claude stood beside her, his voice low but tense. "This is Vincent's move. He's forcing you out. Hannah, if this continues,Luminara Group won't survive. He's cutting straight to the root."

Hannah turned to him, her expression steady, almost unnervingly calm. "You're right. This can't keep up."

She placed her phone down carefully and then lifted her gaze,sharp and unwavering. "That's why," she said, voice cool and firm, "I've decided to sell Luminara Group."

Claude froze, suspecting he had misheard. "Sell it? Hannah,are you serious? That company is your life's work. You built it from nothing. You'd just-give it up?"

Shock ran through him, his voice rising despite himself.

But Hannah's lips curved, not in defeat, but in a faint, icy smile that carried the weight of control. "Of course, I'm not giving it up," she said quietly. "I'm not really selling it." Her eyes locked on his, her voice low, deliberate, edged with intent. "I'm going to 'sell' Luminara Group to myself."

Victoria Hale, her alternate identity, was poised to take action.

Claude's brows drew tight, confusion written clearly across his face.

"Vincent is targeting Luminara Group for one reason only,"Hannah continued, calm and precise. "He believes it's my lifeline-my one weakness. But..." She paused, her voice carrying a cutting edge. " If Luminara She paused, her voice carrying a cutting edge. "If luminara Group no longer 'belongs' to Hannah Scott, and if nothing ties me to it anymore... if, on paper, control shifts to an untouchable powerhouse named Victoria Hale, would Vincent keep burning resources on a war he can't win?"

Her gaze lifted, cool and final. "He won't. The siege will become pointless. By then, Luminara Group will walk free."

Hannah crossed to her desk, unlocked a reinforced cabinet, and swung it open. Inside lay a single file, perfectly aligned. Beside it rested a gleaming signet seal. The seal bore one name,etched in sweeping script: Victoria Hale.

"Luminara Group changes hands," she said softly, brushing her fingertips across the metal crest. Her eyes hardened. "Hannah Scott steps aside. From this moment on, Luminara Group answers only to Victoria. And when that happens, Vincent loses every trail to me."

Claude stared at the seal, his confusion giving way to shock."You're Victoria?"

He was aware of the name, of course. The entire industry did.Years ago, a figure called Victoria Hale had appeared out of nowhere, a strategist who'd carved through the female security tech market with ruthless precision. She'd launched groundbreaking products, crushed competitors, and then disappeared-leaving only rumors in her wake.

Claude's disbelief ebbed, replaced by something heavier.Admiration. Respect. And under it, something he struggled to contain-an almost magnetic pull toward her.

"You have my word," he said, steady and firm. "I'll bring in every Hobbes contact, every resource, to make this seamless.Vincent won't find a single thread to tug." His eyes shone,fierce with resolution.

Hannah turned to him, meeting his gaze. Her voice was quiet, Hannah turned to him, meeting his gaze. Her voice was quiet,
but it carried weight. "Claude, you can't appear in this."
###Chapter 393 A Flawless Meeting
The blaze within Claude's gaze dimmed faintly.

"Claude, if you stand behind Victoria and leverage the Hobbes family's connections and resources, Vincent will catch on,"Hannah remarked evenly, her tone measured with precision."He's aware of our closeness-he'll begin prying."

Her last sentence gratified himn. "Fine. We'll follow your plan."His stare held on her, both steady and burning, his voice hushed yet laced with subdued contentment.

Days afterward, Derek stormed into the Jones Group's top-floor executive office, thrusting a tablet forward with urgency carved into his face.

"Mr. Jones," he panted, his delivery weighted by astonishment and severity, "Luminara Group has just released an emergency statement. They announced that, under overwhelming operational strain and unforeseen impacts, founder Ms. Hannah Scott has resolved to relinquish her entire stake and commence a complete takeover arrangement. The board has already offered preliminary approval!"

Though Vincent was no longer confined to the hospital, pallor lingered on his complexion. His gaze skimmed the statement,and upon landing on the bolded line-"founder Ms. Hannah Scott has resolved to relinquish her entire stake"-his grip tightened until the device strained beneath his whitened knuckles.

"She's actually choosing to sell Luminara Group," Vincent whispered hoarsely. "She would rather surrender it than return to me..." It was painfully clear. She rejected coming back and owering herself, even for the preservation of her company
lowering herself, even for the preservation of her company Her determination was unyielding.

An immense weight of loss and frustration surged through him,stripping him hollow. He'd once believed he could compel her to return. Instead, he had only driven her to sever every last tie For the first time, he'd faced the chilling truth that he might have irretrievably lost her.

Standing nearby, Derek could sense the storm of anguish and reined rage emanating from Vincent. Cold perspiration traced his temples.

Tentatively, Derek asked, subdued and cautious, "Mr. Jones,shall we maintain the suppression initiative?"

Silence.

Moments later, Vincent's frigid response fractured the quiet "No." With Hannah gone, there was no point in crushing Luminara Group any further.

"Track her," Vincent commanded, his tone low and unyielding."Exhaust every channel."

Derek inclined his head. "Yes."



At an elite cosmetic surgery and recovery center, Erica had just concluded her first surgery.

Her attending surgeon detailed the situation. "Ms. Stanton,natural foundation is excellent. To replicate Ms. Scott's craniofacial profile, you'll require no fewer than seven additional core operations, along with refinements and fillers...Accounting for tissue repair, nerve acclimation, and functional adjustment, the total course will extend at least thirteen months."

Thirteen months? The muscles around Erica's lips twitched  Thirteen months? The muscles around Erica's lips twitched faintly beneath the wrappings. "That's acceptable, Thirteen months is trivial. I can endure it."

Thirteen months was nothing compared to the years she'd spent waiting for Vincent. Moreover, she had learned that Hannah had already slipped away from Vincent's grasp. With Claude's aid, Vincent would struggle to locate Hannah anytime soon. Thus, she only needed to practice patience, let the plastic surgeries transform her appearance, and then appear by Vincent's side.

And more than that, she still had Logan with her. He was both her solace during this long recovery and her substitute for Vincent in her relentless training to imitate Hannah perfectly.She anticipated it-the unveiling after thirteen months. By then,Vincent would cherish her exactly as he cherished Hannah.



A year later, within one of Dorbarrow's most prestigious private venues, Vincent stood at the core of a circle of powerful associates.

Clad in a tailored dark ensemble, he appeared leaner than a year prior. A wine glass rested lightly in his grasp, a detached curve faintly shaping his mouth as he fielded praises and probing remarks. Yet, his gaze stayed frosted and remote,sweeping the assembly with the demeanor of a sovereign indifferent to all.

But then, from the edge of his vision, a slender silhouette in a pale-gold mermaid gown seized his notice. That outline-was it Hannah?

Vincent's chest clenched as if seized by ice, his heartbeat arrested in an instant. "Pardon me." The words snapped out,harsh and clipped, cutting off one of his associates mid-sentence. Forcing through the cluster without pause, Vincentbushed aside startled glances and strode quickly toward the figure. A year of suppressed fixation surged beneath his exterior calm;he nearly lunged forward.

Just as that figure neared the exit, his hand shot out and clamped her wrist with sudden force. She spun, startled.

Their gazes collided.

Vincent's stare locked on that visage. It was indeed Hannah.

Erica, her appearance transformed into a spitting image of Hannah through plastic surgeries, restrained the triumphant smile tugging her lips, but her eyes gleamed with elation. "At last, Vincent..." she exulted silently. Everything had unfolded according to her design. This meeting was flawless.
###Chapter 394 Let's Find Our Way Back To Being Friends

The shock crashed over Vincent, leaving him gasping as if the world had stopped. Was the woman standing before him really Hannah?

His eyes fixed on the familiar face, but underneath his shock,mixed emotions churned in raging waves. Why did this "Hannah"standing in front of him feel wrong? Off somehow, like a reflection in shattered glass?

"You... you're Hannah?" Vincent narrowed his gaze, his voice dropping,laced with hesitation and uncertainty.

Inside, Erica's pulse spiked. Panic screamed through her veins.This wasn't at all the reaction she had expected-no barrage of questions, no rush of emotion at her sudden return. Only that sharp, unsettling scrutiny. A pause heavy with doubt that sliced straight through her confidence.

Despite her rising panic, she reminded herself that she had made herself exactly like Hannah, right down to the voice she had painstakingly reconstructed, each note crafted to mirror Hannah's by at least eighty percent.

Her mask of composure couldn't be allowed to falter. She straightened her posture, lifted her chin with feigned indifference, and spoke with an air of practiced aloofness "What's the matter? It's barely been a year, and you don't recognize me anymore?"

Vincent offered nothing in return. His eyes locked on hers,unblinking, heavy with an intensity that made the silence stretch unbearably thin. At last, his voice emerged, low and unnervingly steady, carrying the kind of weight that pre ssed into the skin. "When did you come back?" A flicker of relief sparked in Erica's chest. She steadied her facade, answering with calculated indifference, "Just a few days ago."

She deliberately avoided any detail.

Vincent's eyes lingered, scanning her features with a sharp,unsettling intensity. His brows furrowed deeper, suspicion darkening his gaze. Had distance and time alone carved this strangeness into her? Why did her eyes-so familiar,yet not-feel like they belonged to someone else entirely?

The silence stretched strained, heavy as a rope pulled to breaking.

Beneath the weight of his scrutiny, Erica's calm veneer began to crack. She drew a careful breath, forcing a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.""It's been a long time... How about we catch up over dinner?"

His answer didn't come right away. The pause dragged long enough that Erica's damp palms clenched against her skirt, a cold edge of panic curling in her chest.

After a long pause, his chin dipped in the faintest nod,deliberate and slow. "Alright."

A while later, inside the Cloudtop Restaurant's private room,shadows clung to the corners while candlelight flickered faintly across the table.

The waiter set down the last dessert without a word, bowed politely, and slipped out, leaving only silence behind.

Vincent shattered the stillness at last, his tone quiet but edged with weight, his piercing gaze fixed on her as if he meant to peel away every mask she wore. "This past year... Where were you?"

Erica lifted her napkin with deliberate grace, touching it lightly
Erica lifted her napkin with deliberate grace, touching it lightly to her lips as if buying herself a breath of calm. "After I escaped, my state of mind collapsed. I broke down more than once. The doctor insisted I cut myself off from everything, from every reminder, so I went into seclusion at a sanatorium in Klyvia."

Vincent's fingers stilled on the glass for a beat. "If rest was all you needed..." He swirled the wine slowly, the liquid catching the light as he studied her through its crimson haze,his voice calm, deliberate. "Then what about Luminara Group? That company was your life's work. Why did you let it go so easily?"

Erica's heart tightened, but she smoothed it over with practiced ease. "Do you think I wanted to? I had no choice. Hadn't you been pressing Luminara Group down at every turn at that time?"

Her lashes lowered, a faint veil of sorrow slipping across her eyes, perfectly timed. "Back then, I was falling apart. I could barely keep myself together, much less drag that broken company forward. I was drained. Then, Victoria came to me with an offer. Theprice wasn't much, but she showed sincerity.She swore she'd protect the brand and look after the employees."

She let out a quiet breath, as though revisiting the moment."I thought maybe letting go could be a kind of rebirth. For me.For Luminara Group. Like cutting the chain that kept me bound.So I sold it."

Every word she spoke held up on the surface, her explanation seamless, beyond dispute.

Still, Vincent couldn't shake the unease curling in his chest. In the past, whenever Hannah had spoken of Luminara Group,her voice had carried a burning devotion. But now, that heat was gone, replaced by a distant calm, as though she were simply completing a task she'd planned long ago. It carried none of the raw ache of a heart being torn apart-it rang like a script recited. His gaze sharpened, shadowed by suspicion. Lowering the glass with deliberate calm, he leaned in slightly, his presence pressing down like a heavy weight. "What brings you back?" he asked,tone steady but edged. "I thought you'd walked out of my life forever."

Erica forced herself to hold his stare, carefully stitching together Hannah's proud aloofness with just a thread of wistful yearning. "I wanted to see this place again," she murmured,soft but controlled. "So many memories live here-sweet ones,bitter ones. This city... It's where I belong."

Vincent's eyes drew thin, drilling into every syllable, searching for the soul that was missing. Her replies held together flawlessly, yet an unfamiliar chil lingered in them, unsettling and out of place.

She faltered for a heartbeat before steering the conversation in a different direction. "Vincent, you've been the one questioning me nonstop..." Her voice softened, eyes lifting to study his unreadable face. "Shouldn't I get a turn? Tell me-how have you really been this past year?"

"Fine." The single word came out clipped, sharp, offering nothing more. His gaze stayed fixed on her, cold and unwavering.

That flat, unyielding answer struck Erica harder than she expected, forcing her to swallow down the emotional lines she'd carefully rehearsed. Still, she quickly slipped into character, softening her features with a fragile sorrow.11|Ssthat so? Alright then. That's good to hear."

She dipped her head just a little, weaving a subtle tremor into her voice. "I wasn't fine at all. Claude... He's too radiant, too beyond reach. Next to him, I always faded into the background.In the end, after everything unraveled, we parted ways. Since then, it's only been me-just me. The loneliness gnawed at me,Vincent. In the end, it drove me back here." She lifted her gaze, lashes trembling, her voice no more than a fragile whisper, shaded with quiet pleading. "In this entire city,you're the only person I still truly know. Let the past stay buried where it belongs. If it's possible, let's find our way back to being friends.Please."
###Chapter 395 Returning To Dorbarrow
Erica thought it would be simple-if she could become "friends"with Vincent again, it might bring her closer to him.

Vincent's lips curved almost imperceptibly. Friends? Since when had Hannah ever lowered her head to him? The woman sitting across from him wasn't Hannah, despite that familiar face. The Hannah he knew would rather aim a gun at herself than be trapped by him. So who exactly was this woman?

Vincent stayed silent. After a long pause, he reached for his phone on the table. The motion was steady, casual, yet it cut through the heavy quiet. Without looking at her, he spoke into the receiver. "Bring the car around."

Then, he rose, his shadow falling over her, his voice calm and distant once more. "Come on. I'll take you home."

A flicker of disappointment ran through Erica's chest. Maybe Vincent still hated Hannah for escaping him. But she eased slightly. At least, he wasn't turning her away. She rose quickly."Alright."

The ride back was wrapped in silence.

Vincent leaned into his seat, eyes closed as if resting.

Erica stared out the window. Several times, words rose to her lips, but she swallowed them back. There was no need to hurry.They had time.

At last, the car stopped in front of an upscale apartment complex.

"Thank you," Erica said quietly as she opened the car door and Thank you," Erica said quietly as she opened the car door and stepped out.

Vincent only gave a slight nod.

The tinted window slid up, cutting her view of him completely.

Erica turned and walked into the building.

Inside the car, Vincent's eyes snapped open. He dialed Derek.
His voice was cold, clipped. "Havenridge Apartments, Baycrest
Avenue. Look into a woman there who looks like Hannah."

"Understood," Derek replied immediately.

Upstairs, Erica closed the apartment door and leaned against it,her knees trembling until she sank slowly to the floor. Her heart pounded in her chest.

She lifted her gaze to the full-length mirror in the hallway.The reflection staring back at her wore Hannah's flawless, perfect face. Vincent had personally sent her home. That could only mean one thing-he believed she was Hannah. The first and most critical step was a success.From here on, chances would come.Many of them.

For now,she longed to see Logan. But bringing him here would draw too much attention. She would have to find him herself.



At Dorbarrow International Airport, Hannah walked calmly through the customs channel, pushing a discreet, dark-gray suitcase.

For the past year, she had lived quietly in a coastal city in Cavendria-what felt like an entire rebirth. As Victoria Hale,she had crafted an untraceable life, one that Vincent's men could never pin down.

Margaret's traumatic brain injury from the car crash had healed  Margaret's traumatic brain injury from the car crash had healed far better than doctors dared hope, thanks to steady treatment. That alone had been Hannah's greatest comfort

Throughout the year, Hannah had remotely overseen Luminara Group. and in the meantime, she'd taken up judo.

Claude had kept his word. He flew to Cavendria often, using visits to Margaret as his pretext for short stays. He brought Hannah news from Dorbarrow, and sometimes, as the sun sank along the boardwalk, the two of them would walk together,talking about nothing in particular-always keeping just the right balance of distance and unspoken understanding.

Hannah's return to Dorbarrow now was no whim. Over the past year,under remote management, Luminara Group had survived Vincent's relentless suppression and gradually got back on track.However, the issue of the supply chain's core data being tampered with and leaked had grown increasingly severe-to the point where only Hannah's personal intervention could resolve it.

She had to dive deep into the company's grassroots operations.hiding behind an unremarkable identity, observing,documenting,and uncovering the solution from within.

This task could only be done by Hannah herself. She trusted no one else.

The moment Hannah stepped out of arrivals, she saw a man with a pickup sign waiting. It was Harold Beckett, the driver Claude had sent to meet her.

Harold dipped his head politely, taking her suitcase. "Ms. Scott,the car is outside."

Hannah nodded lightly, ready to follow.

Meanwhile, at the VIP entrance of the international departures hall, Vincent supported Sharon by her arm as he accompanied her to see an old friend off. He leaned slightly tothe side, patient, listening as the two elderly women lingered over their goodbyes.

Then, his gaze drifted-casual, unthinking-toward the arrivals exit. And he froze. A tall, slender figure emerged into view.Hannah.

Vincent's eyes turned cold in an instant. A curl of mockery touched his lips, disdain flickering across his expression. That woman again-the one who looked so much like Hannah. And now she had tracked him here, of all places. She just wouldn't quit,would she?
###Chapter 396 Ritual Of Humiliating Newcomers


Vincent's mouth twisted into a cold,fleeting curl. He ignored the woman whom he assumed was wearing Hannah's face, pretending not to see her while keeping his attention fixed on the courteous exchange between the two elderly women before him. He wanted to gauge how long she could sustain her pretense. Any moment now, she'd try to "accidentally" run into him.

Yet, Hannah never once glanced at Vincent. She trailed Harold directly out of the terminal and slid into the waiting vehicle.

When Vincent eventually shifted his gaze back, the "fake Hannah" had vanished completely. Good. At least she knew when not to overplay her hand. His curl sharpened, cold and cutting, laced with quiet disdain. Meanwhile, Hannah turned down Claude's suggestion of residing at his manor. Instead, she returned to her old apartment in Sterling Heights.Her mother had not accompanied her, which eased the weight on her chest. Had her mother been present, these familiar roads would have torn open far too many buried wounds.

Swallowing the storm of feelings stirring inside her,Hannah focused on reviewing updates about Luminara Group. During her absence, the company had established a brand-new department-Data Analytics. It consisted solely of recruits hired after her departure, making it her prime suspect.

The following morning, at Luminara Group headquarters, Hannah entered the Data Analytics Department. To remain inconspicuous, she donned black-framed spectacles and signed in beneath a false name, "Natalie Preston."

The team leader of the Data Analytics Department,Leonard Yates, half-lifted his lids, skimmed the onboarding folder Hannah extended, and muttered

with thinly veiled impatience, "Natalie Preston,correct? There. That spot in the corner by the window is yours.

Hannah traced the direction of his stubby finger and found the desk he meant. It was piled high with junk.A film of dust blanketed the surface, a forgotten apple husk shriveled beside the keyboard, and the monitor looked like it belonged in a museum.

Around her, coworkers kept silent. A few sneered faintly behind their screens; others appeared numb with indifference.

Plainly, Leonard's ritual of humiliating newcomers was routine.

"Much appreciated, Mr. Yates." Hannah nudged her glasses upward, a sharp gleam flashing from behind them.How had this man ever risen to authority?

Hannah briskly cleared her desk. Just as she prepared to sit, a senior colleague strolled over, hips swaying with showy confidence.

"Hey there, newbie-Natalie, isn't it?" The woman,Marissa Vaughn, plastered on a sticky grin. "Quick hands, huh? Excellent. The company just dumped a load of raw experimental material-printouts,scribbled notes, even a couple of USB sticks. Mr.Yates says you're to sort and input it all. Here, all yours!"

She slammed a heavy bundle of scattered sheets and drives onto Hannah's freshly wiped desk with a loud smack.

"Marissa," murmured a younger female staffer close by, "shouldn't that material be verified before-"

"Oh, verified my foot!" Marissa snapped, her pitch rising sharply. "She's brand-new, right? Time for some fieldwork!"

She pivoted back toward Hannah, sing-songing instructions. "Arrange it all by division and date,compare the paper files against the PDFs on the drives, manually adjust any conflicting numbers on the base spreadsheets, then key the corrected data into the system. Understand? And yes, finish before

you punch out."

No one wanted the burden of that nightmare assignment. With fresh blood available, they finally had someone to dump it on.

The workplace settled into stillness once again.Everyone waited to see how the "new girl" would respond to the transparent trap.

Hannah regarded the messy heap on her desk briefly and then lifted her eyes with calm precision toward Marissa and Leonard. She voiced no protest. She didn't touch the pile. Instead, she reached for the desk phone and dialed the in-house IT helpline."Hello, this is Natalie Preston, recently added to Data Analytics.My station can't connect to the data-entry backend. It keeps displaying a permissions fault.Could you confirm my account configuration?"

Her tone was steady and crisp-cool to the point of razor-edge clarity. Nothing like a panicked first-timer,and certainly not like someone they could push around.

The room's air froze in place. An IT helpline? Access confirmation? This recruit was audacious.Unpredictable, even. Wasn't she supposed to come pleading to them instead?

Per regulation, a newcomer's account access required direct activation by their department supervisor. And Leonard, of course, had purposely skipped that step for Natalie.

Minutes later, the IT line rang back. Hannah pressed the speaker button, letting the clear voice echo across the space. "Ms. Preston, we checked your login. Your access has not been activated-the request has yet to be initiated by your department supervisor.You'll need Mr. Leonard Yates to finalize it."

They had named Leonard outright in front of everyone.

"Appreciated," Hannah replied coolly before cutting the line. Then, she fixed her gaze on Leonard."Mr.Yates,you heard them, correct?"
###Chapter 397 Ex-wife Seen


A hot surge of anger shot straight to Leonard's head.On her very first day, Natalie had somehow managed to get the IT department to call him out-publicly, in front of the whole team. He had never felt so humiliated.

With a sharp bang, Leonard slammed his palm against the desk and lurched to his feet, his bulk quivering with fury. He jabbed a finger at Natalie,ready to explode. But then, his eyes met hers.Calm.Steady. Unflinching.

Something in his chest gave an unexpected jolt. For a split second, he almost faltered. What the hell? Why was he intimidated by a damn newbie? The thought reignited his confidence. No way. If he didn't shut her down now, how would he ever keep control of the team?

Leonard pulled his mouth into a thin, mocking smile.

"Oh, come on, it's just a system permission. No need to get bent out of shape." Dropping back into his chair, he added with forced casualness, "I'll take care of it. Right now."

He shoved his chair closer, unlocked his computer,and began clicking around at a snail's pace. Each pause between movements was so exaggerated that it looked like he was solving some cosmic equation.

Minutes crawled by.

The air in the office thickened-awkward, heavy suffocating.

Hannah didn't urge him. She simply sat at her cluttered desk, quietly flipping through documents,patient and unbothered.

Finally, with only ten minutes left in the workday,Leonard let out an overdone "Aha!" and clicked his mouse with a flourish. "Oh, so that's the button.There we go. All fixed. You've got your access. Time to get to work."

Hannah glanced at her screen, confirmed the access was live,and gave a quiet, detached reply. "Okay."

Ten minutes later, she powered down her computer,gathered her things, and made for the door.

Several employees stared after her, wide-eyed.

Suddenly, Leonard sprang up from his chair, voice booming. "Natalie Preston! What the hell do you think you're doing? Leaving already? Did you even finish your work?"

Hannah stopped at the doorway and slowly turned.Her face stayed composed, her voice even. "Mr.Yates, you didn't activate my access until ten minutes before the end of the day. That delay came from your negligence, not my ability. By any reasonable measure of work hours, there was no way I could finish the task before leaving. You are to blame for this incident."

Her gaze lingered on his flushed, contorted face. She spoke each word with quiet precision. "You're not qualified to be a supervisor."

"You-" Leonard sputtered, pointing a trembling finger at her. His face flamed crimson, yet no words came out.

Beside him, Marissa stiffened. She wanted to speak up and back him, but something in Natalie's commanding presence forced the words back down her throat.

Without sparing them another glance, Hannah turned, clocked out, and pushed open the door. Just like that, she was gone.

In the VIP room of the Gilded Restaurant, Claude had arranged to meet Hannah for dinner. The room door left slightly ajar.

"Try this." Claude slid a plate toward Hannah,butter-poached halibut crowned with a drizzle of lemon beurre blanc. His gaze lingered on her with quiet amusement. "I know you've been craving this for a while."

Hannah cut a small piece, lifted it to her lips, and let the silky, citrus-bright sauce coat her tongue.Her

eyes fluttered shut as she savored it. "Mmm." She leaned back slightly, her voice soft, almost content."That's exactly the flavor l've missed. I couldn't find it anywhere overseas."

For the first time in more than a year, the tension coiled tight inside her had loosened, just a little.

They ate and spoke easily between bites, the atmosphere warm with the familiarity of old friends.

Hannah recounted her day at the Data Analytics Department-the poisonous culture of hazing new hires, Leonard's deliberate obstruction, Marissa's eager piling-on, and the petty "access permissions"trick designed to humiliate her.

Claude's expression cooled, his fork pausing mid-air."Do you think either of them is behind the leaks? Or tampering with the supply chain data?"

"I'm still watching," Hannah said evenly, though her eyes sharpened with focus. "That department isn't as straightforward as it looks."

Hazing newcomers might have seemed like tradition there, but Luminara Group upheld a strict zero-tolerance policy against it.

Just as she was speaking, faint voices carried in from the hallway outside the private room. "Let's take this one.It's quieter."

Hannah's hand stopped mid-air, fork quivering like a compass needle caught in a magnetic storm. That voice... Even muffled by walls and buried under the hum of chatter, she could still pick it out-sharp as glass after more than a year. Vincent.

She had sworn she'd braced herself for the day their paths would collide again. But the moment had arrived sooner than she'd bargained for, and in a place that felt almost too ordinary for such a collision.

Next door, in the hush of another private room,Vincent had just eased into his chair, surrounded by his circle. They were toasting Bobby's return from his latest trip abroad, the wine flowing as freely as the conversation.

A few rounds later, Bobby sauntered back from the restroom, amusement tugging at his lips. Leaning on the table with a crooked grin, he drawled, "Vincent...I could swear l just spotted your ex-wife. She's sitting right next door."
###Chapter 398 Stop Shadowing Me


Vincent kept refilling his glass, drinking steadily, his expression unreadable. There was no flicker of rage,no trace of feeling-none of the response Bobby anticipated. Instead, à cold, slight curl touched the edge of his lips. That woman couldn't be Hannah.Had to be an imposter.

Vincent knew better than anyone that the true Hannah was never returning. Especially not after what he had done to her. She despised him-despised him enough to flee as far as she could. She would never willingly set foot here again.

Vincent tilted his head back and emptied another drink, letting the sting scorch down his throat and burn like embers in his gut.

Bobby had been absent from Dorbarrow for months,yet stories about Vincent and Hannah had still reached him. He leaned closer, dropping his voice.

"Vincent, you certain you don't wish to verify? Seems like your ex-wife was with Claude."

Vincent swallowed hard and placed his glass aside,his face still frozen like stone. "I'm not interested," he muttered without raising his eyes. "Forget it. Let's just keep going."

Meanwhile, in the adjoining private room, Claude's features were shadowed as he regarded Hannah."Should we leave? Head somewhere else?"

"What's the point?" Hannah's reply was calm,steady, and almost detached. "If this was bound to happen, it will. I came back aware I might see Vincent."

She looked at Claude and gave a faint, firm smile."Besides, you traveled all this way. The meal's already ordered. No sense wasting it."

Claude's tension loosened slightly. He nodded and lifted his fork again, putting on a warm grin. "Taste this crab bisque before it cools. It's best when warm."

The two continued their meal. They kept their voices low, quietly returning to their earlier subject.

Dinner ended soon after, and Hannah and Claude moved toward the exit.

Shortly after, Vincent's group emerged from their private room.

They crossed paths at the entrance of the Gilded Restaurant.

For an instant, the atmosphere itself seemed to freeze.

Vincent strode at the center of his companions, his presence dominating despite the alcohol, his command radiating like a silent tempest.

Hannah stood with Claude, clad in an ivory cashmere sweater, her long hair spilling loosely across her shoulders,black-rimmed glasses softening her face.

Vincent's gaze drifted indifferently across the gathering. When his eyes slid over Hannah, there was no break, as though she wvere merely another

 stranger in the throng.

Bobby, however, blinked hard and burst out,shattering the stillness, "Ms. Scott? Damn... It's been a while!"

Hannah lifted her head at the voice, meeting his stare briefly before offering a polite nod.

Vincent didn't spare her even a glance. He kept walking,calm and unhurried. But as he brushed past,his step faltered-barely, almost invisible. He never turned his head. His eyes stayed fixed ahead.And then, in a tone low yet sharp enough to pierce her directly, he said, "Stop shadowing me."
Hannah widened her eyes and froze for a heartbeat.Shadowing him? What nonsense was that? Absurd.

She swallowed back the retort burning in her throat,her face steady as she slid her arm through Claude's and walked straight out.

Claude's mouth curved faintly. He hadn't foreseen that response from Vincent. Fascinating.

The two parties parted without speaking further.

In the dim edge of the lobby, Erica had witnessed every moment. Her brows tightened, fists clenching at her sides. Hannah was back? But Claude had claimed she'd settled abroad...

"Damn it!" Erica hissed under her breath, her eyes sparking with venom. She had endured too much,sacrificed too much, clawed her way too far to allow Hannah's return to wreck everything.She had to act.



At dawn the next morning, Hannah reached the office before the others.

But when she got to her desk, the pile of documents she had left the day before was missing. She frowned lightly bout said nothing.

Rising from her chair, she walked to Leonard's office."Mr. Yates, where are the data files I left on my desk yesterday?"

Leonard lifted his eyes lazily from behind his coffee

mug. "You left early yesterday and slipped behind,"he said, tone slow with apathy. "The project group couldn't wait, so I had Marissa and the rest handle them last night."

Hannah did not argue. It was pointless to argue here."Then what's my task for today?"

Leonard set aside his'mug and reclined in his chair,his heavy frame sinking into the leather. Crossing his arms across his stomach, he said casually, "The urgent work is finished. Nothing much left for you now."

Then, as if reminded of something, he suddenly raised his voice to the entire floor. "Hey, folks! Check if you've got any minor jobs lying around.Hand them over to our new associate, Ms. Preston, so she can get some practice. She must not sit idle!"

His voice scraped through the quiet office like grit.But silence was all that answered him.

Hannah's lips curved faintly. So, he was the one leading the charge in shutting her out.
###Chapter 399 Not Quitting


Leonard sipped his coffee, the corner of his mouth curling into a smile that carried nothing but malice.Natalie had embarrassed him yesterday, and he wasn't about to let that slide. In the Data Analytics Department, his word was as good as law. Anyone who refused to fall in line didn't last long. If he could drive those disobedient ones to quit, even better.

Leonard exchanged a meaningful glance with Marissa.

The cold shoulder only became more obvious after that.

When Hannah approached the break room for coffee, a handful of employees were laughing and chatting. The second she stepped through the doorway, the conversation cut off.

Eyes flicked toward one another, then-almost as if by silent agreement-everyone lowered their heads,

pretending to stir their drinks or scroll their phones.Not a single person turned to acknowledge her. Not one shifted to make room.

The cramped space suddenly felt suffocating.

"Excuse me." Hannah's voice was calm, measured.She poured herself a cup, turned on her heel, and
walked out.

The moment she crossed the threshold, laughter and chatter burst back to life-louder than before.

Later, she attempted to print a set of process flow documents to become familiar with the department's systems.

The printer was jammed, its red light blinking stubbornly.

A male colleague stood waiting nearby, hands in his pockets. He glanced at the machine but didn't move to help.

Hannah stepped up, opened the front panel, and began clearing the crumpled paper with practiced ease.

That was when Marissa strolled over, hips swaying, a thick stack of files in hand.

"Oh no, another jam?" Marissa's voice rang sharp and high, her gaze sliding deliberately over Natalie's fingers. "Honestly, rookies can be so clumsy.Can't even handle a printer without breaking it. Natalie, you do realize this thing costs a fortune, right? Could you even afford to replace it if you wreck it?"

Before Hannah could reply, Marissa shoved the files into the male colleague's arms. "Here, Will, print these for me. I need to hit the restroom."

She tossed Hannah a pointed look before strutting off.

Will accepted the files in silence, spared Hannah a glance, and shifted his gaze back to the printer without a word.

Hannah cleared the jam, got the machine running again, printed her documents, and walked away

without looking back.

Such incidents accumulated interminably. Hannah could see clearly that someone had issued a silent command. The department was purposefully closed off to her.

Hannah laughed quietly and icily. It makes sense why the Data Analytics Department had so many problems. Nobody had a chance here if this was how they handled newbies.

Leonard sat in his chair in his glass-walled cubicle,watching Hannah's "struggles" with a smug little curl at his lips. Just as anticipated. He desired to blunt her rough edges and make her face reality so that she would either swallow her pride and come to him for help, or she'd quit.

But Hannah's face was nothing but calm. No panic,no embarrassment-none of the reaction Leonard craved. In fact, this situation couldn't have worked out to her favor any better. The rest of the team was buried in work, too busy to notice her absence, which meant she finally had the chance to slip away to the

storage warehouse.

Discrepancies she'd spotted while reviewing system logs had been nagging at her. The numbers suggested that inventory data was being altered or deliberately delayed.That would explain why R&D kept receiving false stock levels and incorrect batch reports.

She went to Warehouse No. 3 by slipping down the fire escape.

After a brief, casual greeting with the warehouse manager-and a subtle name-drop of Leonard-she got in.

And there it was. Stacks of defective products were shoved into a corner, left to gather dust.

Hannah tilted her head slightly, her voice measured."What happens to these rejects? Do they need to be logged and scrapped?"

"Scrapped?" The warehouse manager scratched at the back of his head. "Nah. Nobody bothers with

paperwork for this junk. We just stack 'em here until the pile's too big to ignore. Saves us the hassle." He said it likeit was the most ordinary thing in the world.

Her lips curved into a thin, humorless smile. Process loopholes.

She discreetly snapped a few photos of the defective goods and their blurry labels. Then, pretending to verify stock counts, she wandered deeper into the aisles, quietly capturing shots of CCTV blind spots and the sloppy way materials were stored.



Back in the Data Analytics Department, Leonard picked up his mug and started toward the break room. While walking, out of habit, he glanced at Natalie's desk. Empty.

He paused and then smirked. Couldn't handle the pressure, huh? Probably hiding in the restroom,crying. Or better yet-maybe she'd finally accept the reality and marched straight to HR to resign.

He strolled past her desk, deliberately slowing his pace as he neared a nearby colleague, pitching his voice just loud enough for the entire floor to hear."Hey, anyone seen our newbie Natalie? Where'd she wander off to during work hours?"

The colleague blinked and then gave a helpless shrug. "No idea.Maybe the restroom?"

Leonard's smirk widened. He cleared his throat and raised his voice, dripping mockery and exaggerated sympathy into every word. "Ha! Young people these days can't handle a little pressure, can they? We leave her hanging for, what, a couple of hours, and she cracks already? No grit, no sense of responsibility! If you ask me, she's probably marching down to HR right now to-"

The door of the office opened.

Hannah stepped inside, her stride even, her voice cool and steady as she cut him off. "I apologize, Mr.Yates,for interrupting. I'm not quitting."
###Chapter 400 The Manager's Support


Hannah halted briefly, the faintest trace of amusement tugging at her mouth. "I just came back from Warehouse No. 3," she remarked casually."Managed to uncover quite a lot,in fact."

Warehouse No. 3? Leonard's artificial grin froze instantly. His gut churned as dread clawed at him with sharp insistence.

He forced his voice into an imitation of command,but the quiver riding underneath betrayed his unease. "Who instructed you to head over there?Who cleared you to leave your assignment? You're brand new here; you lack the faintest clue about warehouse operations! What in God's name were you doing poking around?"

Hannah nudged her black-rimmed glasses up her nose with measured composure, the icy gleam in her stare making his delivery stumble. "No one cleared

me," she answered calmly. "But as I'm still on probation, Mr. Yates, and survival here depends on proving initiative. I need to understand the trade.Contribute something tangible."

Her head angled faintly, her features easing into something almost questioning, almost guileless, as she held his gaze unflinchingly. "Otherwise, if someone were inclined to tag me as 'idle' or 'uncommitted' simply to rationalize dismissal,wouldn't that be a little unjust?"

Heat surged through Leonard's cheeks. His hand jabbed at her, fingers trembling wildly as fury and dread fed the shake. "You... You're spewing garbage!When did I ever-"

"Why the agitation, Mr. Yates?" Hannah interjected seamlessly, her tone sharp as a razor. "Worried I stumbled into something you'd rather stay buried?"

The strike landed. His pitch climbed a nervous octave."You-you dare talk back to me? Get yourself back to your station. Immediately!"

Hannah remained motionless. Her words flowed with flatness and unyielding authority. "I haven't finished speaking.Why would I return?"

She allowed the silence to breathe for a moment and then dropped the hammer. "Inside Warehouse No.3,I uncovered critical irregularities-management gaps,conflicting records, and undocumented faulty consignments. These are not trivial mistakes."

Her declaration landed like an explosion. A current of alarm swept visibly through the department.

Marissa's complexion drained. Leonard looked as though he'd had the wind punched from his chest.

Leonard snapped, voice tearing upward into a ragged scream. "Rubbish! You're completely out of line! The warehouse is none of your damn concern. If something's wrong, you bring it to me, privately.Got it?"

"I'm afraid that won't work, Mr. Yates," Hannah answered, unshaken and absolute. "The problems I discovered involve central material batches,

 concealed rejects, and stock sheets clashing with system records. That moves this far beyond an internal sweep."

Her arms crossed, eyes steady and cold. "By company rules, I must escalate directly to the department manager or higher. You lack the authority to handle this directly."

Gasps crackled across the room. Several employees exchanged stunned glances. Natalie had slammed shut any door Leonard could slip through.

"You-you're full of crap!" Leonard's composure collapsed utterly. Perspiration shone across his forehead, his bulk rattling with fury and the edge of fear. "I run this team! I decide what gets reported.And if you sidestep me,I'll-"

"You'll what?" The commanding baritone came from the doorway.

The entire floor froze at once. All attention shot toward the entrance. There stood Calvin Briggs, the department manager, his expression a thunderous

 storm. It was plain he had heard at least Leonard's frantic ultimatum.

Calvin's eyes scanned the room, pausing briefly on Leonard's blotchy, stricken face before settling on Natalie with a hint of scrutiny.

"Leonard," Calvin said at last, his tone deceptively calm but heavy as judgment, "who exactly were you threatening just now?"

"Mr. Briggs-no, you've misunderstood!" Leonard babbled, dragging a sleeve across his wet brow."I wasn't-I didn't mean it that way-"

Calvin's gaze dipped toward the ID badge on Natalie's lanyard, his voice crisp, procedural,unbending. "Natalie, did you just claim to have uncovered major problems in Warehouse No. 3 that must come directly to me?"

"Yes, Mr. Briggs." Hannah inclined her head slightly,her delivery steady, professional. "The situation within Warehouse No. 3 is critical and demands swift intervention. I've already drafted some preliminary notes."

"Very well. Tomorrow morning at ten, I expect your account personally." His focus cut like ice toward Leonard, his command sharp as steel. "You and Leonard, together with the senior data analytics leads, will attend this session in my office."

Calvin allowed a breath of silence before adding, his tone edged with authority. "Until then, any detail regarding Warehouse No. 3 is to remain classified.No individual-and I repeat, no individual-will leak or contact warehouse staff privately. Do you all understand?"

"Y-yes!" Leonard sputtered, ducking his head in immediate submission.

As Calvin moved to depart, his gaze lingered on Natalie briefly. Something unreadable flickered behind his stern facade, a subtle complexity."Natalie," he concluded, his voice low, deliberate, "I remember you now. Don't let me down tomorrow."

"Yes, Mr. Briggs," Hannah answered smoothly,her
demeanor composed.

Once back at her station, Hannah immersed herself in structuring her notes. Yet, an unease clung to her -the memory of Calvin's gaze left her unsettled,as though beneath that look lay something she couldn't quite define.

For the moment, the turbulence inside the Data Analytics Department ebbed into uneasy stillness.

At the same time, elsewhere, Erica was already moving to find Claude.
###Chapter 401 The Imposter


Erica stormed into Claude's office within the Fontaine Galleria, rage crackling off her like fire.

Her breathing came in sharp bursts as she confronted Claude. "Claude! You'd better explain this right now! Hannah was supposed to be overseas-so why in the world is she back in town? And why is she suddenly showing up in front of Vincent again?"

Claude's gaze lifted to meet hers, steady and cutting, as though he were staring down from some unreachable summit. There was not a trace of warmth in his expression, only a glint of cold,ridiculing amusement. "Ms. Stanton," he murmured slowly, his words poisoned with disdain, "why get so worked up? Wrath only shifts fillers and stiffens every muscle."

A merciless curl tugged his mouth into a smirk."Careful with that face. After all the time and fortune
you've poured into shaping it into Hannah's reflection, wouldn't it be such a shame if it fell apart?"

Erica's fingers dug into her palm as her voice cut through the air like a blade. "Keep her away from Vincent, Claude! Don't let her cross paths with him again. Or else-"

She left it unfinished, yet the wild blaze in her eyes spelled out the threat in full.

Claude's reply was a low, scornful laugh. "Keep her away? Erica, you can't hold Vincent on your own, and that's your fault only."

He rose from his desk, his stature suddenly overwhelming, his stare honed sharp as a weapon.
"You've been hiding behind Hannah's features for so long, and what has it earned you? Vincent still won't spare you a second glance, and you dare imagine you can steer the board?"

"You-" Erica quivered with fury beneath his merciless words. She moved closer, spitting her
accusation into the space between them. "Rushing to defend Hannah, are we? Claude, you really do care about her, don't you?"

His stare iced over instantly. He stepped back, his presence striking her like a wall of frost. "Stay away from me."

His imposing presence made her stumble a step back. Yet slowly, her lips twisted into a deranged smile-half lunacy, half triumph. Her tone dripped with syrupy mockery. "Why are you so harsh with me? I thought, staring at this face, you might soften for once."

Claude's expression stayed unbroken. Hestudied every artificial curve of her features, the hollow nothingness beneath, before letting each word fall like a blade. "You are nothing like Hannah. All you've crafted is an empty mask. Do better, Erica. Or Vincent will never-never-belong to you."

The cutting words struck harder than a hand across her cheek. "Fine..." She drew in a sharp breath,forcing back the storm inside. Her voice trembled,
her eyes gleamed with frenzy. "I came here for your cooperation. To stage a spectacle. One convincing enough to make Vincent believe-fully-that | am Hannah."

Claude's gaze flickered. He regarded her, his lips drawing into a slow, deliberate smile of ice. "Oh? So you know he never believed you are Hannah. Not entirely stupid, then."

He dropped back onto the sofa, reclining as if this was no more than a show for his amusement."Continue."

Erica leaned in closer, voice lowered, spilling out the intricate design she had crafted piece by piece.

Claude listened without a word, his eyes narrowing with measured intrigue. This charade might actually be worth playing.①



At Jones Group Headquarters, Derek entered Vincent's office with a hefty stack of files-
everything he had unearthed about the impostor with Hannah's face.

"Mr. Jones, that woman has been living under the name-'Hannah Scott'-and for the past year, she's been in Klyvia," Derek reported firmly.

Unlike Vincent, Derek was convinced that the woman Vincent had asked him to look into was Hannah herself.

Derek added. "But here's what stood out among her daily routine-she's been in and out of cosmetic clinics frequently over the last year."

Cosmetic clinics offered plenty of routine treatments,so Derek assumed she was only going in for maintenance.

Vincent sifted through the report, his expression sinking darker with every page. This woman had worked endlessly to recreate Hannah-even setting the name in motion well beforehand. So many visits to cosmetic clinics... Such unwavering resolve. How much agony had she endured just to look like
Hannah? And for what? Was her purpose to get close to him for money?

Vincent snapped the folder shut and gave a clipped command. "Keep digging. Discover her true identity.And if possible, uncover her original face before the plastic surgeries."

"Understood," Derek answered with a nod.

After Derek left, Vincent's phone vibrated. It was Sharon on the line. He picked up, his voice gentlng."Grandma."

Sharon's tone flowed warm and tender. "Vincent come home early today. We're expecting a guest."
###Chapter 402 Her Advantage


When Vincent returned to the Jones family estate,the first sight that greeted him was Sharon beaming with delight, holding the hand of the woman impersonating Hannah. The atmosphere in the room was warm,almost familial.

Vincent's demeanor hardened at once. So this was the "guest" his grandmother had spoken of.

"Grandma." Vincent's tone was quiet,clipped.

"Vincent, you're back! Look who's here!" Sharon exclaimed, grinning widely, her voice overflowing with delight.

Erica inclined her head in a courteous acknowledgment of Vincent.

Vincent refused to grant her a glance. His brow tightened sharply. "The guest you mentioned is her?"His words were flat, as though verifying something
<Chanter 402 Her Advantage	+120 Points at most ridiculous.

Sharon's grin wavered, bewilderment rushing into her gaze. "Why are you reacting like this? This is Hannah!"

Sharon couldn't fathom it. Vincent had once gone to desperate extremes to keep Hannah by his side,persistent and unyielding. Now that she stood before him again, why did he react with nothing but cold detachment, even disdain?

Erica lowered her eyes, her tone controlled and deliberate. "Sharon, I only came to see you. I'll forever appreciate that you remained with me after my parents' tragedy last year. As for everything else... I'd rather not involve myself."

Her phrasing was courteous, yet the hidden suggestion was unmistakable-"everything else"meant Vincent. She cast him a glance, adopting Hannah's signature frown.

Vincent's eyes narrowed. She had closely mastered Hannah's mannerisms. The mimicry was nearly
convincing. Nearly. But the true Hannah would never fix her eyes on him that way-never with a hint of gauging his reaction. She despised him, and her stare had always been unwavering, piercing, and icy.

"Sharon, I'm relieved to see you in good health,"Erica murmured, rising gracefully. "It's late already.I should be going."

Sharon clasped her hand, unwilling. "Hannah, why don't you stay the night?"

Vincent's voice sliced through the space. "What is your actual purpose here?"

Erica matched his gaze. "To visit Sharon, of course."

Vincent scoffed at himself for raising the question.Of course, that would be her reply.

"Aubrey,escort her out," Vincent commanded coldly.He refused to spare a tiny bit of respect for this imposter.

Sharon cast Vincent a reproachful glance. He ignored it.
Erica raised her head and exited with practiced composure. Once inside the car, her lips curled with triumph. Vincent might dismiss her as a stranger, but she had managed to fool Sharon. Sharon's absolute faith-that was her advantage. Vincent's doubt was irrelevant. She still had another act prepared for him,which would surely earn his trust.

Back inside the estate, Sharon swatted her grandson lightly. "Vincent, honestly-aren't you going to run after her?"

Vincent's brow furrowed more deeply."Grandma,do you truly think that woman is Hannah?"

Sharon appeared shaken. "If she isn't Hannah, then who else could she be?"

Vincent said nothing, pensive. Whoever she might be,he would uncover the truth.



The following morning, by the time Hannah entered Calvin's office, Leonard and the others were already
present with the remaining senior staff.

Hannah had arranged everything beforehand. No stacks of sheets, no printed files-every detail of proof and analysis appeared neatly displayed on the screen of her open laptop.

She reported, her tone firm and professional. "Mr.Briggs, regarding the unusual patterns in the company's trial data, my initial review indicates that one of the central flaws arises from the supervision of Warehouse No.3."

Calvin reclined in his leather seat, fingers interlaced,wearing his customary gentle expression. Yet,beneath it lingered a shade of scrutiny and intrigue.He motioned for her to proceed.

Hannah broke down her findings with cutting precision. Her account was concise, well-organized,and struck directly at the core issue. She emphasized the chaotic warehouse oversight and the careless blending of faulty batches without hesitation.
Calvin's easy smile gradually stiffened. The curiosity in his gaze shifted into genuine astonishment-and a flicker of unease. He had believed the newcomer would notice only surface anomalies. He hadn't imagined she would strike straight at the true fracture.

Leaning forward, his tone dropped. "Ms. Preston, this is outstanding work. You've identified the issue with remarkable precision. These failures in warehouse oversight and data control are extremely grave and must be dealt with immediately. All of the evidence is here on your laptop?"

"Yes, Mr. Briggs," Hannah answered evenly, holding his gaze.

"Excellent." He nodded faintly and then altered his tone. "But for the sake of thoroughness-and confidentiality-all original evidence needs to be held under departmental custody. Copy the entire folder to me, including the raw photos and video files. And|assume you've kept backups? Hand them over to me."
Hannah's eyes flickered, yet she inclined her head."Alright."

She handed over the materials as instructed. Once her report concluded, she left the office quietly.

The instant the door closed, Calvin fixed a sharp look on Leonard. "See what you've caused?"
###Chapter 403 Fake Friendliness


Calvin yelled at Leonard, his eyes steely with barely controlled rage, "Your carelessness in handling things almost cost us everything! If I hadn't stepped in, this would've blown straight to the top."

Leonard nearly collapsed under the weight of that glare, his knees going weak. "M-Mr. Briggs, I was wrong!I neglected my duties.I-"

"Shut up," Calvin cut him off, his voice sharp as a blade. "Excuses are useless now. Tell me this-what about the defective stock and those sloppy records Natalie mentioned? Were they handled already?"

"I already sent word," Leonard hastily replied,nodding frantically. "The defective goods are being destroyed, and the irregular records have been corrected!"

A cold, derisive sound escaped Calvin's throat. He jabbed a finger at the stack of reports and photos on
his desk. "Get rid of everything she handed in."

"Yes," Leonard answered.

"Keep an eye on this annoying Natalie," Calvin said,rubbing his chin with deliberate thought. "And find a reason to push her out of Luminara Group."

"Yes." Leonard's eyes darkened, brimming with resentment. He would be more than happy to see Natalie gone. However, he required a plan.



Hannah had sensed the shift in atmosphere the moment her report ended. Once avoiding her workstation or becoming silent whenever she walked into the break room, her coworkers suddenly behaved as though an invisible ban had been lifted.

One of her coworkers, Linda Donovan, who had never spoken to Hannah before, actually looked up and grinned as Hannah carried a cup of water to the printer. "Printing something, Natalie?" Her tone was casual,almost as if they had always shared this level
of familiarity.
"Yes, Ms. Donovan," Hannah answered with calm politeness.

Later, Marissa approached carrying a small box of fruit candies, her practiced smile radiating warmth."Natalie, want to try one? They were brought back from abroad by a buddy.

"Thank you, Ms. Vaughn." Hannah took the candy and placed it neatly on the corner of her desk without opening it.

By lunch, several younger women-usually clustered around Marissa-"happened" to pass Hannah's desk."Your presentation this morning was impressive,Natalie! Even Mr. Briggs gave you kudos. Honestly,we should come to you for advice more often."

Hannah replied with courteous reserve, adjusting her black-rimmed spectacles, "Thank you for your kind words, but I was only doing my job. And I don't think I have much advice to offer. Let's all learn from one another instead."
She wasn't fooled in the slightest. She understood these sudden gestures of friendliness were calculated.

Peace, however, didn't last long. The storm was brewing fast, awaiting Hannah.

On an ordinary Tuesday morning,Hannah sat at her desk and switched on her computer.

The startup dragged unnaturally long before the monitor began to flicker wildly. A moment later, the screen froze, an unforgiving blue error glaring back at her.

"What happened?" a colleague sitting nearby whispered, leaning over curiously.

Hannah didn't reply. She simply picked up the phone and called IT.

Kevin Lopez, the IT technician, arrived quickly. After a few swift keystrokes, his expression hardened."Ms. Preston, your computer's been hit with a nasty virus. It's designed to corrupt documents-you'll
need a full system reinstall."

As he spoke, he ran a quick scan. Suddenly, he froze,letting out a sharp, startled sound. His finger lingered on a hidden folder deep within the system. "Wait,isn't this a document from an internal meeting? It's flagged confidential. Why would this be on your computer?"

Though his voice wasn't raised, the words carried across the office with perfect clarity.

In an instant, every head turned toward Hannah.Suspicion, shock, and barely hidden schadenfreude thickened the air.

Marissa let out a theatrical gasp. "Confidential files?How could this be on your computer, Natalie? This is a serious problem!"

Hannah remained composed as she saw right through it. This was an unmistakable setup. Those recent displays of friendliness had been nothing but a charade, aiming to lower her guard while the mastermind pulled the strings.
Hannah gazed at Kevin, her voice steady. "Please go ahead and reinstall the system for me."

But before Kevin could proceed, she leaned down,her fingers flying over the keyboard with practiced ease. Beneath the surface, she triggered an administrator script-silently exporting the full system logs and network records onto the encrypted USB drive she always carried.

She didn't straighten until she had secured the proof,watching calmly as Kevin began formatting the drive.

She hadn't expected that the computer fiasco was only the beginning. More plots were already on their way.
###Chapter 404 Corporate Espionage


Hannah's handset vibrated with an incoming alert from Finance.

The tone across the line was edged, carrying accusation. "Ms. Preston, the invoices you turned in raise serious concerns. They appear to involve fraudulent reimbursements. Report to Finance without delay."

Hannah's expression tightened. She had never filed any invoices.

Throughout the workplace, hushed comments spread instantly, like spectators primed for a spectacle.

"Forged invoices? All for a bit of extra money?"

"Stooping to that low? Didn't see that coming..."

"First confidential files, now false invoices-quite the

streak."

Marissa materialized with uncanny timing, her features arranged in feigned sympathy. "Natalie, did you perhaps grab the wrong invoice by mistake?Younger staff should stay grounded, not pursue shortcuts. Just confess to Finance, return the money,and prevent this from wrecking your probation performance."

Hannah ignored Marissa, turning to set off to Finance -only to be blocked by two men. Both wore badges from Luminara Group's Security Department.

The one in front held up his badge, his delivery measured. "Natalie Preston, we represent Security.In connection with a suspected breach tied to company project material, your compliance is required. Provide your laptop and phone at once."

The entire workplace froze into silence.

Hannah adjusted her glasses and met his gaze squarely. "I'll comply," she replied steadily. "But explain-what exactly is the extent of this
investigation? And what grounds justify the search of my laptop and phone?"

The investigator's brows twitched, caught off guard by resistance from a junior employee. Nonetheless,he recited the scripted rationale. "Core project specifications from our company appeared within a rival's latest launch. Senior executives are incensed.Preliminary logs indicate irregular entries from your account at the critical time. Questionable data may exist on your hardware. We must secure your devices for forensic review."

"Irregular entries? Questionable data?" Hannah repeated, her voice like steel. "Has Security confirmed the authenticity of those logs? Ruled out the possibility of tampering or false flags? And regarding the alleged questionable files, what proof shows they were accessed or downloaded by me personally?"

Her challenge cut straight to the key questions. For an instant, the investigator faltered. The truth was,their conclusions were based only on preliminary
leads. "These issues will be clarified through further analysis," he shot back, forcing authority into his voice. "Surrender the devices, or escalation will follow."

"Compliance isn't something I am unwilling to offer,"Hannah said, her tone still calm. "However,according to company policy, I'm entitled to observe the sealing of my property, record device identifiers, current state, and precise seizure time. I also demand a written Notice of Investigation, detailing the charges and the stated rationale."

Her phrasing was exact, citing policy line by line. Her stance remained composed, resolute, immovable.

The investigator's expression tightened. He hadn't anticipated such mastery of company policy from a supposed novice-or such fearlessness.

At that moment, Leonard surged forward, stabbing a finger in her direction. "Natalie! Watch your tone!Who do you think you are, haggling with Security?Hand your devices over immediately!"
Hannah granted him only a frosty glance before dismissing him entirely, her focus unwavering on the investigator. "Due process underpins every investigation. If Security disregards its own protocols, how can the investigation results be trusted-or deemed impartial?"

The atmosphere held taut. The investigator hesitated and then signaled to his colleague.

The colleague departed briefly and returned carrying a stamped,formal Notice of Investigation.

Hannah read it thoroughly and then smoothly activated her phone's camera. "According to company policy, I will cooperate fuly," she stated."But I also retain the right to document the sealing of my property."

She angled the lens toward Security."Proceed."

Her demeanor stayed impeccable-professional,precise,impossible to fault.

Step by step, the process unfolded under her
surveillance-equipment bagged, seals attached,documentation signed. Every procedure followed protocol without exception.

The investigators had no option but to comply,irritation flickering beneath the surface while the recording captured all.

Off to the side, Leonard burned with rage at her defiance. He advanced, his voice lowering into a counterfeit note of concern. "Natalie, hear me out. If you resign quietly, before this snowballs, I'll put in a favorable word with Mr. Briggs. You'll still retain some reputation. Otherwise..."

His tone hardened, twisting into an open threat."When Security uncovers firm proof, this becomes espionage. No employer will ever touch you again.You could face prison. And at that point-nothing will protect you. Your future is destroyed."

Hannah fixed her glacial stare on him, her words slicing like a blade. "Mr. Yates,you seem remarkably quick to declare me guilty of espionage. Is this a verdict before any trial or perhaps a reflection of your
###Chapter 405 He Had Backing


Leonard's temper flared at Hannah's remark, his tone climbing. "Me? Guilty? Don't make me laugh!Security is investigating you, not me! What do I have to be afraid of? What should I be scared of? I warned you to step aside while there was still a chance-that was me handing you a sliver of respect. Once the verdict arrives, it's over. You'll be dismissed, cast out with nothing. Let's hear how bold you sound then!"

Hannah's mouth curved faintly. "Then we'll wait for the verdict. What's your hurry?"

Her stare sharpened, slicing through him. "By the way, after I filed the report on the infractions in Warehouse No. 3, the penalty for you hasn't been declared yet, has it? Odd. You face no punishment,yet I'm the one under scrutiny. Interesting, isn't it?"

The remarks rippled across the workplace, provoking gasps and muffled chatter. What was happening?
Would Leonard end up penalized?

Leonard's skin drained of color. His hand quivered as he pointed at her. "Natalie, don't you dare defame me! The warehouse mess came from juniors-it's unrelated to me! You believe I'm scared of you? You think you can topple me?"

Hannah caught the slip at once, her eyes narrowing."Oh? So someone shielding you?"

Her gaze swept the crowd, pausing on Leonard's bloated features, and then drifting to the coworkers who swiftly looked away. "That explains plenty..."

No wonder the office followed Leonard's command-ostracizing her when he ordered it, fawning over her when he changed his mind. No wonder her report of grave misconduct had yielded nothing,leaving Leonard utterly unfazed. So, Leonard had backing.Could it be Calvin?

She recalled the day Calvin had demanded she deliver her report in his office the day after, the disdainful stares on her colleagues' faces. They must
have known her efforts would amount to nothing.Likely because Calvin backed Leonard.

Leonard's mouth twisted into a vicious smirk."Damn right I've got support. And what of it? You're nothing but a newcomer without allies, without influence.What do you possess to challenge me? Oppose me,and you're finished."

He leaned close, his tone venomous and low. "By dawn, you'll be stripped of everything. No career, no standing, no prospects. You'll be shattered-completely destroyed."

The atmosphere froze. Nobody dared stir.

At the edge, Marissa allowed the slightest sneer to tug at her lips.

Leonard's laugh erupted-crude, victorious-as if Natalie's downfall was already sealed. He jutted out his chest and paraded back toward his quarters.

Hannah's eyes gleamed with icy steel. "Very well.We'll see." She offered no further word, returning to her workstation.

Hannah pulled out her phone and entered the executive messaging channel. As Victoria Hale, she tapped a short note to Luminara Group's Vice President, Adrian Miller. "Private Room One,Cloudtop Restaurant, 8 p.m. tonight."

Leonard had barely settled back in his office when Marissa entered, locking the door behind her.

"Leo, wasn't I flawless? Perfect, wasn't it?" she asked sweetly. She was the one who had engineered the scheme unseen.

Leonard snapped the curtains shut and hauled her close, his greasy palms roaming boldly. "You were superb. Thanks to you, tomorrow she's gone entirely.Then, this department is ours again. We'll bleed it for every kickback we want!"

A flicker of scheming lit Marissa's eyes as she coiled around him like a serpent, fingertips sketching idle circles over his chest. "And how do you plan to reward me?" Leonard's chuckle was lewd. His thick hand gripped her bottom hard. "Come to my place tonight, I'll make you come. More than once." His stare blazed with raw lust.

Marissa feigned a coy shiver, voice dripping with tease."Alright, but you'd better keep your word."

... At 8 p.m., in Cloudtop Restaurant's Private Room One,Hannah sat at the head, her expression calm and unreadable.

The door swung quietly open.

Adrian stepped inside. He appeared near thirty, his aura sharp yet steady.

But once his eyes landed on Hannah, astonishment overtook him-swiftly chased by awe. "V-Victoria?"His tone quivered with disbelief and reverence."When did you return? Why didn't you inform me sooner? Should I prepare accommodations right away? Your executive office is still intact-cleaned daily,awaiting your comeback-" Hannah lifted a hand, halting his eager words.Her voice was firm, cool, and absolute. "Mr. Miller, spare the formalities. We can catch up later. I called you here tonight for one reason. To resolve a matter."
###Chapter 406 Chance Encounter


Adrian was an individual whom Hannah elevated after taking control of Luminara Group while operating under the persona of Victoria. His ascent required no explanation-he·was intelligent, driven, and highly skilled.

As Hannah spoke, she withdrew a black USB drive from her purse and carefully set it before Adrian.

"Contained inside," she murmured,her tone firm yet hushed, "is proof I personally uncovered. Leonard Yates-head of the Data Analytics Department-has been forging warehouse documentation, diverting defective resources, meddling with refund systems,falsifying safety logs, and targeting innocent staff.The sequence of evidence is solid and indisputable."

Her gaze lifted, sharp as steel. "I want you to act in my stead. Strip him of his authority immediately in the company's name. Then, initiate proper legal action to ensure accountability."

Adrian shifted his eyes from the USB drive to the Woman across the table, calm yet emanating suffocating dominance. His features showed reverence-tinged with confusion. "Victoria, you're the CEO and Chairwoman of Luminara Group. You wield the supreme power. You could dismiss any employee with a single order."

Hannah shook her head slightly. "Adrian, right now,I'm not the CEO. I'm Natalie Preston-a junior data analyst. I joined the company under this identity to conduct a ground-level investigation."

Adrian's composure fractured into raw disbelief and concern. "But... You could have asked someone else to do the job. Such a position is beneath you."

"Nothing is beneath me," Hannah replied, her tone as unyielding as iron. "Every action is for the company.I came in at the ground level to find the rot inside our supply chain. Leonard is only the visible issue. The true danger goes deeper-the cause of inflated expenses, broken data, and frozen R&D." She pushed her glasses up, her voice turning frostier."I already delivered the warehouse violations to Calvin Briggs. Instead of acting, he buried them and enabled Leonard to retaliate against me. That proves Calvin isn't only aware-he's shielding Leonard.Possibly even working alongside Leonard."

Adrian's eyes thinned as the realization formed."Then, tomorrow I'll eliminate both-Calvin and Leonard. Hand them over to law enforcement."

"No." Hannah's rejection was instant. "Calvin cannot be touched. Not yet."

Adrian blinked. "For what reason?"

"Leonard is expendable. Calvin is mid-rank."Hannah's voice dropped to a whisper, carrying an understanding of the larger scheme. "| suspect someone higher is covering them. A figure influential enough to let Calvin suppress warehouse scandals,block the Security Department's inquiry, frame me,and keep his seat despite everything. That degree of protection signals a much larger presence-perhaps senior executive level. Or external forces entirely." Her stare fixed on Adrian, unwavering. "If we strike Calvin now, his backer will retreat further. The real traitor will vanish into the dark. Thus, we begin with Leonard. Cut off Calvin's right hand. Let him stumble.Then, we exploit Leonard's downfall to follow the thread leading to Calvin and the hand guiding him."

Understanding dawned on Adrian. Reverence transformed into resolve. "Understood. We'll strike where you direct. You have my complete support."

Hannah inclined her head, her tone easing only slightly. Together, they leaned in over the table as she began to outline, in hushed detail, the steps of tomorrow's plan.

When their exchange at last concluded and they stepped from the secluded chamber, Hannah and Adrian nearly collided with someone moving along the corridor. It was Vincent.

As Vice President of Luminara Group, Adrian frequently engaged with the Jones Group.

The instant Adrian spotted Vincent, a courteous smile lit his features. He advanced, hand extended in greeting. "Mr. Jones! What a pleasant surprise."

Hannah halted, silently cursing Dorbarrow's size. Out of every possible spot, she hadn't expected to encounter Vincent again so quickly. But what unsettled her more was the stench of liquor surrounding him-so potent that it deepened her frown.How much had he consumed?

Vincent had, in truth, drunk several rounds, yet he remained clear-headed. His eyes skimmed coldly over Adrian with a token nod-civil,perfunctory.

Then, his gaze slid-and fastened on her. His brows tightened. This bold imposter appeared before him again. So it wasn't enough that she borrowed Hannah's face to cling to Claude? Now she was engaging with Adrian Miller of Luminara Group? This woman had set her sights on quite a few men.

Vincent's mouth curved in a razor smile, his stare at her soaked in venomous derision. "What's this?Shifted your target already?"
###Chapter 407 Petty Tricks


Hannah halted briefly, her forehead creasing in tension. What on earth was that supposed to convey? How ridiculous! She had no wish to clash with Vincent, but the blaze in her chest forced the retort out. "Perhaps you should consult a doctor instead of spouting nonsense here."

Vincent stared, briefly thrown off by her bluntness,before his fury ignited with greater force. He advanced closer, his tall frame casting a shadow over her, his tone deep and laced with menace."You bring another man to a place where I engage in business talk? What is this-your latest stunt at pulling a chance encounter? Your petty tricks never cease to amuse me."

"Pulling a chance encounter?" Hannah reacted as though she'd heard the most ridiculous jest. A chilly curve touched her lips, her eyes sharp with derision."You really think too highly of yourself.I simply dined with a companion here and happened to run into you.What makes you believe you're someone I'd pursue?"

Vincent's lips curled, his look hardening. "Is that so?Haven't you pursued me relentlessly?"

The air between them pulsed with unbearable charge.

Adrian, stuck between them, was drenched in sweat.Anyone could tell their past was complcated, and the animosity surrounding them was thick enough to suffocate.He quickly cut in, "Uh... I just remembered something pressing at the office. I'l be leaving-you two continue."

And with that, he nearly sprinted away, terrified of being dragged into their clash.

Watching Adrian's hasty flight, Vincent's grin widened. "What's the matter? Did I frighten away your bankroll?"

Hannah's stare turned glacial, her laugh sharp as shards. "My bankroll? How do you know I'm not the one providing for him?"

For once, Vincent's tongue failed him. What gave her the audacity to claim that? "So many antics," he muttered, suppressing the strange ache in his chest,his voice freezing. "In the end, aren't you just after money?"

Hannah said nothing and only fixed him with a piercing glare.

That expression displeased Vincent, fueling his rage until it boiled over. Abruptly, he seized her slender wrist."Come with me!"

Before she could protest, he yanked her down the hallway toward a secluded chamber.

"Release me!" Hannah fought desperately, pain lancing through her wrist under his crushing hold.

But Vincent's grip remained unbreakable. With a violent crash, he forced the door open.

Inside, a circle of men were drinking. They froze, startled by Vincent barging in with a woman dragged beside him.

"Vincent? Weren't you leaving? Why'd you return?"Bobby's eyes shifted to Hannah, widening."Whoa-bringing your ex-wife? What's this? You two reconciling?"

"She means nothing to me!" Vincent declared coldly,shoving Hannah forward.

Hannah stumbled but managed to regain her balance.

Vincent's glance swept the chamber with cruel derision before settling back on Hannah. "Aren't you full of all those tricks of yours? Here's an entire room of men. They're all wealthy-choose as you like.Enjoy yourself!" His voice climbed, thick with venom."Just stay the hell away from me!"

The room went dead silent. Every look fastened onto Hannah-some curious, some disdainful, others hungry for spectacle. A suffocating surge of shame crashed over Hannah,her frame faintly shaking with wrath. Yet, she shed no tears, raised no screams, showed no collapse.

Step by step, she moved to the marble table in the center of the chamber. It was covered with bottles and fruit trays.

She lifted a glass of amber whiskey, her motions steady and precise.

Every glance followed her, including Vincent's. He watched, certain she was about to yield-ready to fit the script he'd imagined. A sneer pulled at his mouth.

But in the next second, Hannah snapped her wrist.The liquor curved through the air and splattered squarely across Vincent's handsome face. The chilling liquid streamed down his jaw, seeping into the collar of his costly attire.

The moment hung suspended. The chamber froze in absolute quiet. No one could trust what they'd just seen. Vincent-doused in the face, in front of everyone? Hannah stood unwavering, her tone unyielding steel."You're right-I do excel at playing tricks. Especially with men like you, swollen with vanity and utterly repulsive." She paused, her stare fixed on him."Vincent, after a year apart, you've only grown even more insufferable."
###Chapter 408 Not A Single Drop Left


Hannah hurled her empty wine glass to the floor,shards scattering as she shot Vincent a glacial glance before striding toward the door.

Snapping out of his daze, Vincent instinctively grabbed her wrist. What struck him wasn't anger-it was a strange, fleeting sense of familiarity, as if the true Hannah had resurfaced for an instant. But he knew better. It was all an act.

Forced to a halt, Hannah turned back, her eyes cold and disdainful. Her voice cut through the air, dipping with contempt. "What? Haven't you had enough?"

She wrenched against his grip, pain flaring up her wrist.

But Vincent held firm, tightening his grasp, his gaze boring into her as if to unearth a hidden truth. "You put on a convincing show. You look like her, but you're not her." Her patience snapped as she jerked her hand even harder. "What nonsense are you spouting? I don't have time for this.Let me go!"

"You want to leave? Fine." Vincent's lips curled into a cruel smile. His gaze shifted toward the marble table,crowded with bottles and glasses. He gestured at the alcohol. "Finish all of it. Every drop. Consider it your punishment. Next time, it won't stop at drinks."

The sight of her struck a nerve-he loathed this woman pretending to be Hannah.

Hannah let out a cold laugh, eyes burning with scorn.Forcing her to drink all this? In his dreams!

"Vincent, that's too much!" Bobby finally stepped forward, unable to stand by any longer.

Bobby gently tried to pry Vincent's hand away,offering Hannah a reassuring smile. "Vincent, how could you demand this of Ms. Scott? One glass is more than enough. Don't you all agree?" He looked to the others for support. The crowd, though entertained by the spectacle,nodded in agreement.

"Yeah, just one glass is enough."

"One drink to settle it-then we drop this."

But Vincent ignored them. His gaze stayed locked on her defiant face, as if he could break her pride and prove her a fraud. His voice was cold. "I said all of it.Not a single drop left."

The room fell silent again.

Bobby exhaled heavily, resigned.

Hannah's eyes flicked from Vincent to the mountain of drinks. Slowly, a frigid smile spread across her lips."Fine. Have it your way!"

Her tone was soft but cut through the silence.

Amidst their shocked stares, Hannah yanked her wrist free-not to grab a drink, but to seize the edge of the table. With a surge of strength, she flipped it.

The crash was deafening. Crystal shattered, liquor splashed across the carpet, soaking shoes and pants, The liquor sprayed in all directions, seeping into the plush carpet and drenching the shoes and trouser legs of those standing too close.

With that, chaos broke out instantly. Everyone recoiled, screaming and jumping back.

Through it all, Hannah stood calm and unshaken.

Vincent, closest to the wreckage, blinked through the liquor dripping down his face, staring at her as that strange familiarity tugged at him again.

Hannah met his gaze, her voice sharp and cutting."Exactly what you asked; not a single drop left!" Her lips curved into a cold smile. "Goodbye."

Her eyes lingered on his furious expression before she added, "No... It's goodbye for good."

Without another glance, she walked out, each step deliberate.

The door slammed shut. The room exploded in stunned voices. "She... She flipped the table!"

"Unbelievable. She's insane!"

Vincent's expression darkened, unsettled. Who was this woman? How could she mimic Hannah so flawlessly? For a moment, he had almost believed she was Hannah herself.

Bobby clapped a hand on Vincent's shoulder,baffled. "What's wrong with you? Why are you treating Hannah like that?"

"She's not Hannah." Vincent tugged irritably at his tie.

Bobby stared, incredulous. "What are you talking about? If she isn't Hannah, then who is she?"

Vincent's brow furrowed."I wish I knew."

Meanwhile,Hannah strode quickly down the quiet corridor toward the elevators. Rounding a corner, she spotted two familiar figures standing ahead. She hesitated mid-step, surprised to see them together.
###Chapter 409 Are You Certain You Want Me Gone
Leonard and Marissa lingered behind a tall potted plant, their backs to Hannah, whispering in low voices.

Instinctively, Hannah slipped into the shadow of a nearby column, holding her breath.

Leonard was clearly drunk; his face was flushed,and his steps unsteady.

Marissa clung to him, one hand propping him up, the other resting far too comfortably on his waist. She leaned in close, her body almost draped over him.

A cold smile tugged at Hannah's lips as she watched.If she recalled correctly, Leonard had a wife. So this was the root of Marissa's arrogance at the office-an affair with her superior.

Without hesitation, Hannah drew out her phone and snapped a picture. Sliding her phone back into her pocket, she eased a few steps away and quickly made for the elevators by another path.

The next morning, Hannah arrived at the office earlier than usual.

She had barely settled at her desk when two security investigators strode in, faces grim. One of them spoke in a formal tone. "Natalie Preston, following preliminary investigation, irregularities have been detected in your access to core project data.Confidential files were found on your computer,raising strong suspicions of a data breach. Effective immediately, your access is suspended, and you are required to cooperate with further inquiry."

Gasps rippled across the office.

"Natalie! Do you have anything to say for yourself?"Marissa was the first to pounce. She jabbed a finger at Hannah, her voice shrill. "The evidence is right there! You're a traitor-a corporate spy!"

"Yeah! You've disgraced our department!" chimed in
several of Marissa and Leonard's loyal hangers-on,eager to strike while Hannah was already reeling.

Leonard swaggered forward, pulling a document from his pocket and slamming it onto Natalie's desk with deliberate force. It was a Notice of Termination.

"Natalie, you're suspected of serious misconduct-leaking company secrets and causing the firm heavy losses." Leonard's voice boomed. "After departmental review and senior approval, your contract is terminated effective immediately. Pack your things and leave at once. The legal and security teams will pursue the matter further."

Leonard's eyes gleamed with triumph. "The evidence is conclusive. Like it or not,you're finished here."

All eyes turned to Hannah, waiting for her to crumble,plead, or lash out. Instead, she glanced at the document with cool indifference. "The security department hasn't even issued its final report. And yet you're eager to pass judgment on suspicion alone?" One of the security investigators frowned slightly before saying, "The final conclusion does require further investigation. But so far, the evidence is highly unfavorable to you."

"So in other words, nothing's been proven yet."Hannah's gaze cut sharply to Leonard. "Mr. Yates,why the rush? Afraid a deeper investigation might expose something else?"

Leonard faltered under her stare, his chest tightening. He raised his voice to mask it. "Nonsense!The proof is right there! Security-what are you waiting for?"

The two guards stepped closer to Hannah's desk.

"Remove this traitor from the premises!" Leonard barked, his voice cracking.

The guards loomed over her, but Hannah didn't move. Her eyes locked on Leonard's reddened face."Are you certain you want me gone?"

"Certain? There's no doubt!" Leonard sneered. "Do you think someone's coming to rescue you? Dream on! You're finished. Get out!"

"Fine." Her lips curved into a sharper smile. She didn't pack a single item. Picking up the notice, she rose and walked out between the guards.

A glance at her watch told her the timing was perfect.

At that very moment, Adrian's assistant rushed in from the data department. His voice carried across the office."Leonard Yates. Natalie Preston. Mr. Miller wants to see you in his office-now."
###Chapter 410 Forced To Bring Her Back
After completing the announcement, Adrian's assistant departed.

Leonard was momentarily stunned, but his expression quickly shifted into a sycophantic grin filled with self-satisfaction. Now Adrian wished to see him? Surely it was because Adrian had heard how decisively he had handled the leak and was ready to reward him. Of course, Adrian would praise him for acting swiftly and eliminating a threat from the department. He might even get promoted.

Straightening his suit, Leonard hurried toward Adrian's office. When he arrived, Calvin was already seated inside.

Leonard gave Calvin a polite nod of greeting.

"Where is Natalie?" Adrian scowled, not seeing Hannah.

Leonard's smile faltered for a moment. Then, he waved dismissively, his voice dripping with self-congratulatory pride. "Oh, her! She was involved in the leak, so I fired her. She's no longer with the company.You don't need to see her. I told her to get lost."

Adrian's expression darkened immediately. His sharp gaze locked onto Leonard as his voice turned cold."Fired? Who granted you the right to dismiss her?"

Startled by Adrian's harsh tone and icy stare,Leonard's arrogance collapsed in an instant. He stammered, "I... I was following company policy...She was suspected of leaking information... The evidence was conclusive..."

"Conclusive evidence?" Adrian's voice rose sharply,heavy with authority and disbelief. "Has the Security Department issued its final report? Has the Legal Department made a ruling? Who gave you the power to dismiss an employee before the investigation was complete?" The barrage of questions left Leonard completely dumbfounded, cold sweat breaking out across his forehead."I...l..."

Adrian no longer spared Leonard a glance. Instead,he turned to Calvin, his tone even harsher. "Mr.Briggs, what is going on here? Is this how your people handle matters?"

Caught off guard, Calvin stiffened. He shot Leonard a furious glare before hastily explaining, "This was mishandled by Leonard.We-"

Adrian cut him off bluntly. "I don't care how you handle things internally. I want to see Natalie right now." His gaze sharpened, slicing through Leonard like a blade as he enunciated every word. "Go. Bring her back now. If she doesn't return, you'll be out of a job."

Calvin's brows twitched hard. What was this about?
Did Adrian actually know Natalie?

Leonard's legs nearly gave out at Adrian's words, and he almost collapsed where he stood. He glanced at Adrian, then at Calvin, whose expression was equally grim.

Without another word, Leonard scrambled toward the door. "I'll go, right away, right away!" Dignity forgotten, he stumbled out of the office to fetch Natalie back.



Meanwhile, Hannah walked calmly through the revolving doors of the Luminara Group's headquarters, bag in hand. Her every step was unhurried, her composure unshaken.

Suddenly, a frantic shout rang out from behind."Natalie! Wait!"

Hannah turned slowly. She spotted Leonard's bulky frame stumbling toward her, his suit rumpled, his face slick with sweat.

Breathless and panting, Leonard blurted out, "Don't go yet. Mr. Miller wants to see you."

Hannah tilted her head, her calm gaze fixed on him, a mocking smile tugging at her lips. "Mr. Yates? Why the run to catch up with me? Weren't you the one who told me to get lost?"

She lifted the Termination of Employment Notice and waved it lightly in front of him. "It's right here, plain as day. I'm no longer part of Luminara Group. Mr.Miller wants to meet with someone who's already been fired? Doesn't sound very appropriate to me."

Leonard's face drained of color at the sight of the notice. In a sudden, desperate move, he lunged forward, snatched the paper from her hand, and tore it to pieces. "This notice is void. You're still an employee of Luminara Group." Spinning on his heel,he barked, "You're coming with me to see Mr. Miller right now! Hurry up. Don't keep him waiting."

He tossed the shredded remains carelessly onto the floor.

Hannah didn't move. She simply stood there, her expression cool, eyes glinting with icy ridicule. Her gaze flicked down to the scraps at his feet. Her voice, though quiet, carried a razor's edge of contempt. "Mr. Yates, how could you just throw trash around? Clean up your own mess."

Humiliation twisted Leonard's face, his eyes burning with spite. "Natalie Preston, don't push me too far!"
###Chapter 411 Proof Of Frame-up


"You already find it too much, Mr. Yates?" Hannah regarded Leonard with cold detachment, a derisive smile tugging at the edge of her mouth. "All I ask is a simple task. You're begging me to stay, so act the part. Otherwise, I'll just leave."

Leon's eyes blazed with indignation. How dare she dictate to him? Yet, since Adrian had expressly requested her presence, he had no option but to endure.

"Very well, I'll clean." Leonard choked back his fury,retrieved a broom from the janitor's closet, and cleaned the floor.

Once he completed the task, Hannah turned and walked away without pause. "That's more like it. Let's go. We shouldn't keep Mr. Miller waiting."

Leonard straightened up, shooting a venomous glare at her retreating form. He snorted. Did she truly believe she would get off lightly with Adrian? He planned to tell on her thoroughly and make her pay.By then, she'd be the one begging him for mercy.

With that in mind, Leonard trailed after her.

Shortly thereafter, Leonard and Hannah entered Adrian's office.

Adrian and Hannah traded a subtle look, and she offered him a brief nod.

The three positioned themselves before Adrian's desk. For a brief interval, quiet enveloped the space.

Leonard shattered the hush first, unable to restrain himself. "Mr. Miller, didyou call Natalie here because of the company's project leak? Do you intend to interrogate her personally?" He jabbed a finger toward Natalie, his voice quivering with righteous outrage. "Natalie is the corporate betrayer, an industrial espionage agent. You must impose severe punishment on her without mercy!"

Calvin interjected immediately, his tone solemn, "Mr. Miller, Doyle is correct. This prompted our department to enforce strict disciplinary measures against her per company policy."

Calvin sought to rationalize their choice to dismiss Natalie.

Hannah absorbed their twisted claims, a chill,scornful arc forming on her lips. Even at this juncture,they persisted in besmirching her. They would not cease until confronting their own downfall.

Adrian stayed mute for the moment. He reclined slightly in his expansive chair, his fingers drumming idly on the polished desk surface with a faint, steady "tap,tap,tap..."

The rhythm reverberated in the office's stillness,each beat striking at Leonard's and Calvin's taut nerves.

"Mr. Miller, you have no idea what sort of individual Natalie is. She consistently neglects her duties and takes shortcuts. Precisely the type who would disclose the company's vital projects," Leonard continued, his pitch escalating with fervor.

"Is that so? Yet, I've learned that Miss Preston was set up by you misusing your position," Adrian said at last, his tone shifting to a glacial chill.

Leonard and Calvin replied together, "Absolutely not."

Hannah lifted hner head deliberately, her stare composed and resolute as it aligned with Adrian's.Her words rang out firm and steady. "Mr. Miller,l possess proof."

Leonard's and Calvin's pulses surged in alarm. But they promptly dismissed her claim. How could she hold any proof?

Hannah accessed Adrian's office computer, inserted her external USB drive, and unveiled the files sequentially. Simultaneously, their details projected vividly on the expansive screen via the room's display system.

Key records appeared: timestamps from access logs under falsified staff IDs, IP origins, and indicators of digital alteration software-paired with a certification report from a specialized cybersecurity agency,verifying the logs as intentionally fabricated.

Moreover, the dubious file on her device-its origin timestamp, transfer route, and access history activating the watermark tracking protocol-all linked to an overseas IP. Deeper analysis showed this IP had interacted with Leonard's private email, establishing that the file was intentionally inserted and accessed remotely to frame her. Furthermore, there was her documentation of the discrepancies in Warehouse No.3.

All these materials constituted the meticulous compilation she had assembled to expose Leonard's scheme to set her up.

Hannah's tone cut like frost, her piercing regard locked on Leonard's rounded features. "This proof suffices entirely to demonstrate that you engineered the project leak, leveraging your role to falsify access entries and deposit counterfeit files onto my system to frame me. And the spurious inventory in Warehouse No. 3, the flawed goods concealed within, the diverted finances... The evidence stands irrefutable." Her eyes shifted to Calvin.

"Fabricated, all of it!" Leonard bolted upright,extending a quivering finger toward the display. His cry escalated to a rasping yell, laced with unbridled dread. "These are inventions! Natalie, you're setting me up! Mr. Miller, you cannot believe her!"

"It has undergone authentication." Adrian's scrutiny intensified, centered on Leonard. "This material has received dual confirmation from an external cybersecurity firm engaged by the corporation and the in-house legal division. The findings are unequivocal and absolute. Everything proves authentic. No traces of alteration exist!"

The previous day, Hannah had approached Adrian and provided the USB drive, requesting its validation,thus eliminating any possibility/ of contestation.
###Chapter 412 Leonard's Downfall


Leonard felt as though every ounce of energy had vanished. His knees buckled, and with a heavy crash,he sank into the sofa. His complexion drained of color, his lips quivered, and his frightened gaze locked on Calvin.

Calvin's expression hardened with blazing anger. He recognized that Leonard's end had come, and he needed to sever ties with Leonard instantly.

Facing Adrian, Calvin arranged his features into an appearance of "shock" and "grief." "Mr. Miller, this is simply outrageous-I knew nothing about it! Leonard,how could you dare commit such a thing behind my back? You... You've betrayed me utterly!"

He wasted no time shifting every ounce of blame onto Leonard.
"Mr. Briggs, you can't treat me this way!" Leonard's voice cracked with disbelief and anguish. "It was you who instructed me to-"

Before Leonard's words concluded, Calvin burst forth and silenced him. "Enough, Leonard! You caused this disaster, so you'll face the music alone! Stop fabricating lies!" His stare sharpened, layered with menace and warning.

Hannah observed Calvin's desperate attempt to cast off responsibility, a frosty curve lifting her mouth.Calvin still retained value, and she resolved not to cast him aside for the moment.

At the precise instant, she interjected with composure and quiet insight, "Mr. Briggs has set aside time to hear my report on the Warehouse No.3issues. I don't believe he shielded Mr. Yates-perhaps he was simply overwhelmed and neglected to address and submit it?"

Calvin seized the lifeline immediately, forcing a mask of "remorse" onto his face. "Yes, Natalie speaks truth! The department has been swamped with ceaseless duties recently, and in the confusion,I overlooked this case. Still, it was my negligence.I accept full responsibility."

Adrian studied Calvin's theatrics with icy detachment, seeing through them entirely. His tone dropped to a low, cutting register. "Mr. Briggs, your weak oversight and failure to detect and disclose grave risks constitute severe negligence. Three months' wages will be withheld! You are commanded to reorganize your section at once and scrutinize every similar situation. Should any further failings emerge, the punishment will be ruthless!"

Calvin exhaled soundlessly in relief.Forfeiting three months' wages stung, yet compared with exposure and downfall, the penalty was no more than a slap.He bent swiftly. "Yes, Mr. MAiller! I will reflect earnestly, correct without delay, and ensure it never repeats."

Adrian's gaze shifted toward Leonard, who slumped upon the sofa, his skin deathly pale. His eyes hardened like ice. "And you, Leonard Yates-abusing power and fabricating charges. You have gravely breached company rules, inflicting major losses and tarnishing its reputation. From this moment,you are terminated and barred from any rehiring. Any evidence of unlawful activity will be turned over to the courts for prosecution!"

Adrian then addressed Hannah, "From today forward,Natalie, you shall assume Leonard's role as supervisor. Administrative arrangements will be processed immediately."

Hannah responded with steady composure, "Thank you, Mr.Miller.I will not disappoint you."

Everything unfolded exactly as Hannah had planned.This promotion had been settled with Adrian the night before, designed to ensure Calvin would not get off too easily. Moreover, this appointment might even prompt Calvin to reach out to her. lf "cooperation" could be struck, the investigation would advance far more effectively.

Calvin's brow flickered; he had never expected this woman to be entrusted with such weight. His plans to install his own allies collapsed in an instant. Could Natalie be turned into an asset for him? "No! You can't do this to me!" Leonard wailed in despair. He suddenly hurled himself at Calvin. "Mr.Briggs, don't discard me like this! Save me-please!I've sacrificed so much for you..."

He clutched at Calvin like a drowning soul seizing a rope.

Calvin wrenched free, his eyes glinting with revulsion. "Leonard! You sealed your own ruin, and now bear it yourself! I cannot save you. Guards!Guards!"

The guards stationed outside stormed in immediately, gripping Leonard's arms. His body was slack as clay, tears and mucus running down his face.

"Remove him," Adrian commanded coldly.

"Natalie Preston, you witch! You framed me! You'll pay for this! Mark my words!" Leonard shrieked as he was dragged away.

As Leonard was hauled to the exit, Hannah's lipslifted in a meaningful curve. "Why get so worked up already? I arranged a little gift for you. By my calculation, it should be arriving now."

Leonard's curses ceased at once. His eyes widened with horror. He already knew she was capable of much worse. What further torment was she preparing for him?
###Chapter 413 New Supervisor


The echoes of Leonard's curses still lingered in the corridor as security dragged him out of Adrian's office.

News spread like wildfire. Everyone in the Data Analytics Department now knew-Leonard had been fired.

When the word reached Marissa, her face drained of color. She shrank into her chair, trembling. Leonard had been fired. What would become of her now?Would she be dismissed as well?

Before she could spiral further, the sharp staccato of heels cut across the floor. A furious voice rang out."Leonard! Get the hell out of here! Tell me who that homewrecker is!"

Heads snapped up in shock.

A plump, middle-aged woman stormed in, clutching several photographs in her hand, her eyes wild and searching.It was Leonard's wife-Tracy Yates.

At the entrance, Leonard froze at the sound of her voice. His body shuddered as he lifted his head in dread. "H-Honey, what are you doing here?"

Tracy's eyes locked onto him. She stormed forward and slapped the photos against his face. "What am I doing here? Look at what you've done!" Her voice was sharp with venom. "Tell me, who's this tramp?"

The photos fluttered to the floor for all to see-Leonard's arm wrapping around Marissa's waist,Marissa kissing his cheek, his hand boldly resting on her hip. Every detail was clear. Every pose left no room for doubt.

Gasps erupted as employees craned their necks to look.

Leonard's face turned ashen. He hastily said,"Honey, I can explain! It's not what it looks like-l...I have nothing to do with her!" "Nothing to do with her?" Tracy's voice quivered with rage. She jabbed at the photo with a shaking finger."She's kissing you, and your hand is on her backside!What kind of 'misunderstanding' is that? Do you take me for a fool?"

Her eyes swept the office, searing with fury. "Which one of you is she? Who's the mistress? Get out here right now!"

The room fell silent. No one dared breathe.

Marissa stared fixedly at her desk, praying to disappear. But Tracy's glare zeroed in on her without hesitation.

"It's you!" Tracy roared, lunging forwvard and yanking Marissa's hair. "You shameless whore-seducing my husband and wrecking my family! I'll tear you apart!"

"Ah!" Marissa shrieked, clawing frantically at Tracy's hands.

Leonard rushed forward, panic-stricken. "Honey,stop! Please, stop-it's a misunderstanding!" Seeing her husband protect his mistress only drove Tracy into a frenzy. One hand twisted Marissa's hair while the other raked her nails across Leonard's face.

The office erupted into chaos. Papers flew, chairs toppled, and the three of them writhed in a messy brawl at the center of the room.

Employees scattered back in alarm, unwilling to get caught in the melee.

At the doorway, Hannah stood quietly, watching.The faintest smile touched her lips. This was the surprise she had prepared for Leonard. She had sent those photos to Tracy herself-and the outcome was even better than she imagined.

Casting one last glance at the scene, Hannah stepped forward with calm, deliberate strides. She reached for the intercom on the supervisor's desk.Her voice was steady and commanding as it rang through the chaos: "Security. Remove these three troublemakers immediately."

"Yes, ma'am!" The security captain snapped to attention, dispatching his men at once.

The guards swarmed in, forcing the trio apart and dragging them out, kicking and screaming.

Silence settled over the office once more.

Hannah walked to the doorway of the supervisor's office.Her gaze landed on the enamel mug Leonard had treasured for years, stamped with the words Director of the Year.

She picked it up. With a sharp crash, she hurled it into the trash bin.

The metallic clang rang out, making every heart in the room jolt.

Turning, Hannah faced the stunned employees.Her back was straight, her voice calm and unwavering."From this day forward, I am the new supervisor of the Data Analytics Department. Let's deliver fruitful results by working seamlessly."
Her words froze the staff where they stood. A woman who had joined less than a month ago, dismissed as a suspected traitor, had returned-suddenly installed as their supervisor? Just what kind of background did she have?
###Chapter 414 Kidnapped


Erica had spent days preparing and had finally arranged the kidnappers for the charade. The grand plan she and Claude had woven in whispers was finally ready to be set in motion.

Erica went through the ploy one last time with Claude, every step carefully measured, before leaving the confrontation with Vincent in his hands.

That very afternoon at the Jones Group, Vincent was deep in discussion with several business partners when the door slammed open with a violent bang.

Claude stormed in, disheveled and frantic, his eyes locking onto Vincent with what appeared to be desperate intensity. "Vincent Jones!" His voice was raw, like gravel dragged across stone. "Where's Anna? Did you take her?"

Vincent's brows furrowed sharply. "What are you talking about?" he demanded, rising to his feet,his gaze like a drawn blade.

Claude shoved forward, palms crashing down on the desk, his frame leaning in with barely contained panic. "She's gone! She left yesterday afternoon and never came back. Her phone's dead-I've turned the city upside down looking for her!" His eyes bored into Vincent's, trembling with anguish. "Was it you?Did you conceal her once more after realizing she had returned?"

At that, Vincent's heart gave a violent lurch. A single thought struck him like a bolt out of a clear sky."She's back in the country?" His voice trembled, a flicker of longing escaping before he could rein it in.

"Of course!" Claude snapped. "If I weren't desperate,I'd never have come to you. I'd rather die than let you be the one to find her!"

Claude's fingers clawed through his hair, his voice breaking with confusion. "I think... I think she's been kidnapped, maybe by an enemy! But who could she have offended? Anna never-" Then, his voice broke, and he couldn't go on.

"An enemy?" Vincent's eyes chilled over, a name flashing across his mind like a shadow. "There is one," he muttered, his voice low and sharp."Brinley Gilbert."

Without delay, Vincent pulled every string within reach and got through to the international prison.

The guard on duty confirmed Brinley hadn't moved an inch-still locked behind bars. And just like that,the trail hit a dead end.

The minutes crawled by, heavy with dread.

Then, Claude's phone rang.

The voice that crackled through was distorted,metallic, stripped of any trace of humanity. "Claude,if you want Hannah alive, prepare ten million dollars in cash. No cops. At ten tonight, come alone to the abandoned garage in the western suburbs.Otherwise, prepare to collect a corpse."

The line went dead.  Claude's face ddrained of color. He quickly relayed the words to Vincent.

Vincent's gaze hardened, sharp enough to cut steel."I'm going with you," he said without hesitation.

Claude turned on his heel, and in the corner of his mouth, a smile as dark as ink flickered unseen.Everything was unfolding exactly as he'd hoped.

Later, at the abandoned garage in the western suburbs, Vincent and Claude pulled up a safe distance away, headlights cutting briefly through the dark before they were killed.

Inside, the garage was dimly lit, a few emergency lights casting a sickly green glow.

"Anna!" Claude called out, his voice apparently low but urgent.

A faint, muffled whimper answered from the corner.

Vincent and Claude followed the sound and found "Hannah" tied to a rust-stained iron pillar, tape pressed over her mouth, her hair hanging in disarray."Anna!" Claude cried, about to rush forward.

"Stop!" A chilling voice cut through the air. Several masked men stepped out of the shadows. Their leader raised a gun, the barrel catching the dim light."Where's the money?" he demanded.

Vincent swallowed his fury, his chest tightening at the sight of "Hannah" bound. He shoved the suitcase forward. "It's here. Let her go."

The leader tore the tape away from the face of "Hannah" and let out a harsh laugh. "Well, if it isn't Mr. Jones himself. Perfect-saves us the trouble of hunting you down."

With a wave of his hand, another kidnapper hauled someone out from the deeper shadows.

The leader smirked. "Let's see who we've got here."

Vincent froze. It was Sharon, his grandmother.Her eyes were shut, her skin pale, her body limp in their grip.

"Grandma!" Vincent's voice cracked, fury boiling inside him.

"Sharon, what's happening to you?" Erica cried, her body trembling against the ropes. Panic edged her voice. "She doesn't look good! Please-save her first!"

"Shut up!" the leader shapped. He struck her across the face with a vicious backhand.

"Ah!" Erica screamed as her head whipped to the side. A raw, red mark spread across her cheek.

"Anna!" Claude's "anguished" shout filled the air.

The leader sneered, his gun sweeping between Sharon and Erica. "We've got the money," he said coldly. "Now choose. Ten million buys only one life.The old one or the young one?"

###Chapter 415 Almost Unreal


A heavy silence filled the air. Everyone was waiting for Vincent to make his choice between "Hannah"and Sharon.

Claude lingered at the side, watching with cool detachment.

"I won't choose!" Vincent's voice was iron. "I'm taking them both!"

The moment the words left his mouth, Vincent hurled the suitcase at the nearest kidnapper and lunged forward with sudden ferocity.

"Take him down!" the leader of the kidnappers barked, startled by Vincent's outburst. Remembering Erica's warning-no casualties-he fired low.

The bullet grazed Vincent's shoulder before sparking against the sheet metal wall.Claude didn't go for the kidnappers. He went straight to Erica, cutting at the ropes with practiced speed."Not bad," he muttered under his breath. "Quite the show you staged."

"Cost me a fortune," Erica whispered back with quiet pride.

Freed, Erica scrambled to Sharon's side, her face twisting in feigned panic. She clutched Sharon's hand. "Sharon! Please wake up-don't scare me!"

Still crying, she pulled out her phone, her voice breaking with measured urgency. "Hello?I am at an abandoned garage in the western suburbs!Someone's unconscious-send an ambulance now!"

Meanwhile, Vincent fought like a man possessed.Three against one, yet his blows landed sharp and merciless, driving the kidnappers back step by step.

"Retreat!" the leader barked, realizing the tide had turned.

A few quick feints, and the kidnappers melted into the shadows, vanishing into the night.

Vincent didn't chase. He spun to Sharon, kneeling at her side. Relief washed through him when he confirmed she was only unconscious.

Only then did he lift his head, his gaze falling on "Hannah" beside him. "Are you... all right?" His voice was hoarse.

Tears glistened in Erica's lashes as she forced a trembling smile. "I'm fine..." She shifted her gaze to Sharon and said urgently, "But we need to rush Sharon to the hospital fast."

Just then, Claude walked over, his gaze heavy on Vincent.Measured gratitude flickered there-but also a cold warning. "Vincent, thank you for today. But l still hope you won't keep clinging to Anna. She's finally found peace. Please let he go."

This was a deliberate ploy by Claude-the more he appeared to care about the "Hannah," the more convincing Erica's disguise would seem. Without waiting for a response, Claude bent and helped Erica lift Sharon. Together, they moved toward the sound of sirens outside.

But as they walked, Erica couldn't help glancing back.

Vincent stood frozen, his eyes locked on her.

An ache tugged at Erica's chest, pulling her toward him. She started to turn-but Claude's hand clamped down, stopping her. His voice was low, meant only for her. "Don't look back."

Erica's brow furrowed. "Why not? This is my chance to get closer to him."

Claude let out a short, icy laugh. "You still don't understand Hannah. At a time like this, she would never abandon Sharon-unconscious and in an unknown state-just because she was shaken or saw Vincent get hurt. All her attention and worry would be on Sharon. If you want Vincent to believe you're Hannah, then act like Hannah. Right now, that means walking away without looking back." His words jolted her. He was right. She wasn't Erica anymore-she was Hannah. She still had a long game to play with Vincent. She had gone through all this effort, every move calculated, just to make Vincent believe she was Hannah.

Her mind made up, Erica went with Claude, not turning back.

Vincent stood rooted to the spot, his face streaked with blood and marked by the fight. his expression dark with doubt. He had always believed Hannah would never return to Dorbarrow. And yet here she was-so vivid, almost unreal. And on top of that,he had just encountered an imposter pretending to be her...

Later, on the drive to the hospital, suspicion still gnawed at Vincent. He finally pulled out his phone and dialed Derek. "Check Hannah's flight records.Find out if she really came back."
###Chapter 416 An Invitation To Dinner


Sharon had been in the hospital for several days.With careful treatment and rest, her condition had stabilized-her life was no longer in danger.

At her bedside, Erica sat quietly, her expression artfully arranged into remorse and self-reproach."Sharon, I'm so sorry..." Her voice trembled faintly."If I hadn't asked you to go shopping with me that day,you and I wouldn't have been kidnapped."

Sharon patted her hand kindly, her voice gentle."Silly girl, how could this be your fault? It was those kidnappers-they were deranged. What matters is our safety.These old bones of mine can still hold up."

Across the room, Vincent sat on the sofa, silent,his gaze dark and distant. After a moment, he checked his watch. "Grandma, get some rest. I have a meeting at the company, so I'll head out now."

At his words, Erica rose to her feet, carefully imitating Hannah's detached tone. "Can we talk? Just a moment."

Vincent glanced at her and then nodded lightly. "All right."

They walked to the far end of the corridor, away from the ward.

Erica repeated Claude's advice in her mind: stay distant, keep boundaries clear, stir guilt by invoking the past.

She angled her body slightly away from Vincent,her voice steady but edged with finality. "Thank you for yesterday. But there's nothing between us anymore.I hope we won't have any further ties."

Vincent studied her in silence, his brows faintly furrowed. "You truly don't want any connection with me?" His voice was low, uncertain.

Erica forced composure, letting just the right amount of pain flicker in her eyes. "Yes. I can't forget the days you kept me locked away." Her words hit hard. Vincent's eyes darkened with conflict, emotions churning beneath the surface.After a long pause, he gave a nod, his voice hoarse."I understand."
Satisfied with his reaction, Erica lowered her gaze. "If there's nothing else, I'll go back to stay with Sharon."

He murmured, "Alright."

She didn't look back as she returned to the ward.

Vincent remained in the corridor, unmoving.Suddenly, his phone buzzed in his pocket. Derek's name flashed on the screen.

Vincent answered, his tone clipped. "Speak."

"Mr. Jones," Derek reported, "It's confirmed-Ms.Scott has returned to the country."

The words struck Vincent like thunder. "I see," he rasped, forcing down the turmoil inside.

Vincent hung up and let his gaze fall through the glass onto the "Hannah" inside the ward. All evidence pointed to the woman inside being Hannah.But was she really Hannah?



Meanwhile, in the Luminara Group, since the day Hannah ousted Leonard, humiliated Marissa,and secured her position as supervisor, the Data Analytics Department's atmosphere had shifted completely.Employees who once ignored or belittled her now greeted her respectfully whenever she passed.

Marissa had changed the most. Her arrogance was gone; each time she encountered Hannah, she lowered her head quickly and slipped away.

Hannah never went out of her way to make things hard for Marissa, assigning tasks strictly by the book.Still, the unspoken pressure left Marissa walking on eggshells.

Calvin had been quiet lately-until the company's new initiative, the TrustLink Project, was announced.Hannah could sense his restlessness growing again. Eventually, Calvin extended an invitation to dinner.She accepted.

At precisely seven that evening, Hannah arrived at the decorated private dining room. But only Calvin was inside. He greeted her warmly and gestured for her to take a seat.

After a few drinks, his smile grew more familiar, his tone more indulgent. He set down his glass and leaned forward, assuming the air of a superior addressing his subordinates. His tone carried both warmth and subtle authority as he said, "Natalie,you've worked tirelessly these past few weeks. You stepped in as supervisor, straightened out the chaos Leonard left behind, and under crushing pressure,managed to bring order to the company's tangled project data. That wasn't just work-it was endurance, persistence. Truly, it couldn't have been easy."

Hannah smiled modestly, her humility perfectly measured. "You flatter me, Mr. Briggs. I was just doing my job." Beneath the table, she tapped her phone to start recording.

Calvin's eyes gleamed. "I've seen your abilities. Tell me,are you interested in earning more money?"

Inwardly, Hannah sneered. Outwardly, she played along, her smile tinged with just the right hint of ambition. "Well, isn't that why we all work-to make more money?"

Calvin slapped his thigh and chuckled. "Ha-ha! I like that! Straightforward. No nonsense." He leaned in closer, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper."So, how about joining us? We can make some real money together."
###Chapter 417 An Uncanny Resemblance


"Real money?" Hannah's features flickered with measured bewilderment, as if Calvin's remark hadn't fully registered. "Mr. Briggs, I don't follow your point."

A cold spark crossed Calvin's gaze. He chose to drop any pretense and get straight to the point."What I'm saying is, join us in taking kickbacks and earning real cash! This new project-the Stellink Plan-is a goldmine." His voice dropped to a whisper, eyes locked on her."Do it properly, and it's effortless profit.At least,this much."

He gestured with two fingers, signaling a large sum.

A shiver slid down Hannah's chest. Just as she had suspected, Calvin was attempting to pull her into siphoning money from the project.

Hannah masked her thoughts with a calculated expression change, her eyes flashing just the right mix of shock and fear. "Mr. Briggs, how could you even raise such an idea? I...I'm scared!"

She leaned back faintly, acting unsettled, her tone sharp with apparent unease. "Are you certain we won't get caught? What if the higher-ups look into it? By then, we'll be ruined!"

"What's there to be afraid of?" Calvin brushed her concern aside with a wave, conceit carved across his face. Leaning in with calm confidence, he lowered his tone. "Honestly, we've got a shield in the higher-up,and I know all the angles. As long as we stand together, nothing will collapse. So, what do you say,Natalie?Are you with us? Join us, and you'll get your share."

Calvin's eyes stayed pinned to her, waiting for her reply. If she agreed, he would gain a strong accomplice.If she declined, he wouldn't hesitate to silence her.

Hannah's face shifted again, as if drawn between temptation and fear. She stayed silent for a few breaths and then gradually tilted her head up, eyes narrowing with quiet resolve. "Mr. Briggs, are you truly confident no trace will ever surface?"
She hadn't pledged herself outright. She was probing, fishing for the identity of their backer.

Believing her "uncertainty," Calvin brightened. He struck his chest with assertiveness. "Don't worry! It's airtight-cook the books, grease the right palms, and it'll go off without a hitch!"

Hannah exhaled deeply, as though sealing a grave choice. "Mr. Briggs, I'll be counting on you from now on."

"Excellent!" Calvin burst into laughter, tipping back his glass until it was empty. "Natalie, from today, we're in the same boat!"

Hannah lifted her own glass and sipped with measured calm. She had them all in her sights.

******

That afternoon, Derek strode through the Luminara Group's lobby, a sealed envelope gripped tightly. He was delivering a critical addendum for a collaboration,requiring Luminara Group's legal division to endorse.

Exiting the elevator, Derek caught sight of a woman behind black-rimmed spectacles. She looked strikingly like Hannah!

If he hadn't been aware that Vincent was dining at the Jones estate with Sharon and the real Hannah,he might have believed this woman was Hannah. But no-she was the imposter. The resemblance was uncanny.

Once his errand was complete, Derek hesitated and then sought an old acquaintance in Luminara Group's HR section. After casual greetings, he went straight to the point, producing Hannah's photo. "Does this woman work here? How long has she been with your company?"

The acquaintance frowned briefly and then answered quickly, "Oh? You're referring to Natalie Preston, the supervisor of the Data Analytics Department? She's remarkable! Barely a month in, and she's already forced the prior supervisor out! Now, the whole department looks up to her. Why, Derek? Do you know her?"

In that flash, Derek understood-the imposter Vincent had asked him to investigate was named Natalie Preston. She hadn't vanished at all-she had risen to become a supervisor at the Luminara Group.

Derek's heartbeat surged. With trembling hands, he drew out his phone and dialed Vincent's number.

The line connected almost instantly. "Mr. Jones!" Derek's voice quivered with barely controlled astonishment. Dropping low,he rushed on."I found Ms. Scott's imposter at Luminara Group! Her name is Natalie Preston!"

On the other end, Vincent's tone stiffened in disbelief. "She's employed at Luminara Group now?"

"Yes, Mr. Jones-without question," Derek replied. "She's the present supervisor of their Data Analytics Department!"

A brief silence-then Vincent's words cut through. "I'm heading there immediately!"

Derek grasped that Vincent intended to confirm it himself. Glancing at the envelope still in his grip, he quickly added, "But Mr. Jones, the document's already been signed!"

"Invent a reason. Delay them!" Vincent's tone brooked no resistance.

"Understood!" Derek answered at once.
###Chapter 418 What About Luminara Group


At the Jones family estate, Sharon had deliberately invited "Hannah" over for dinner and had also insisted that Vincent join them.

After Vincent ended his conversation with Derek on the phone, his eyes stayed locked intensely on "Hannah."

Erica, noticing Vincent's stare from the edge of her sight, savored his attention.

Sharon clasped her hand and turned toward Vincent. "Vincent, during my stay in the hospital, Hannah came nearly every single day to look after me. After dinner, you should definitely thank her properly."

"Sharon, it was the least I could do. If not for me, you never would have been abducted." Erica's features carried a hint of measured regret.

Sharon cast her a sideways look and murmured,"Why bring that up again? That Chapter is already closed."

Erica was about to say more when Vincent abruptly rose to his feet.

His sudden motion caused a teacup on the nearby table to topple. The clatter rang out sharp and clear.

Both Sharon and Erica flinched at the noise.

"What's wrong?" Sharon's gaze shifted to Vincent. "What's troubling you? You seem unwell."

Erica also got to her feet, her expression etched with worry, and asked, "Mr. Jones, have you not been resting enough?"

Vincent forced down the storm inside him. His words were frosted. "I have something to attend to. I'll be leaving now."

Sharon quickly called after him,′′Vincent! What's the rush? Can't you stay for dinner? Hannah finally comes to join us for dinner." She kept giving Vincent meaningful looks.

"Sharon, it's fine. Mr. Jones surely has his own matters to deal with," Erica said. Her demeanor shifted into something tangled yet gentle as she turned toward Vincent. "But since I'm here, there's a favor I hope you can grant me."

Vincent halted, a crease appearing across his brow, and replied,"Go on."

Erica drew a steadying breath, as though summoning bravery, her tone laced with unease and hope."Could I join your company? I'd accept any position, even the most modest."

She inclined her head slightly, her voice weighted with a delicate, measured mix of sorrow and entreaty."I've been back such a long while already. I cannot remain without work."

At once, Sharon chimed in with a cheerful smile,′′Certainly, Hannah, after everything you've been through,and after being away more than a year, it'sonly right we support you. Vincent, arrange her in a comfortable position.Don't overwork her!"

Erica gave a faint smile. She intended to work at his company to get closer to him. This was her second step. With Sharon's compassion and urging, she bet Vincent had no grounds to deny her.

Yet, Vincent's expression stayed unreadable, his gaze chilling further."What about Luminara Group?"

Erica's heart tightened at his remark, and she answered swiftly with a strained smile, "Luminara Group is no longer mine.Everything is different now. Returning there holds no vaue."

Vincent then asked, "I assumed you would approach Claude for assistance."

Erica remained composed, her explanation already prepared. "Claude is caught in his own trouble. I don't wish to burden him."

"Noted." Vincent gave no promise, delivering her a long, penetrating look.

Without another glance, he strode toward the door.

"Vincent! Vincent! WVhy must you be in such haste?" Sharon shouted after him Erica grew pensive. She had expected he wouldn't grant an immediate answer. What captivated her instead was where he was dashing off to in such urgency.

After a moment's hesitation, Erica excused herself to place a call. She moved into a secluded corner to dial Derek's number. Derek, being Vincent's trusted aide, should know Vincent's destination.

The line connected almost at once.

"Hello? Ms. Scott?" Derek's voice came through, distant yet courteous.

"Derek, Vincent left so quickly just now, and he didn't look well. His grandmother feels uneasy and asked me to check where he went. Did he head back to the company?" Erica used Sharon's name, keeping her tone steady and casual.

On the other end, Derek hesitated, ultimately choosing concealment, and replied evenly, "Mr. Jones proceeded to the Luminara Group to manage urgent company business. An essential project document required his direct involvement. Please tell Mrs. Jones she needn't be anxious."

Luminara Group again? Erica frowned. Her chest tightened as realization struck. There must be something deeper.

She ended the call and at once rang Claude.

The connection was immediate.
"Claude, anyone special working at the Lumninara Group?" Erica's voice trembled with unmistakable tension and dread. "Vincent just stormed out of the Jones family residence and rushed to the Luminara Group."
###Chapter 419 No Husband Or Boyfriend


On the opposite side of the call, Claude, who had been sprawled lazily across the sofa, abruptly straightened his posture. The ease on his features disappeared at once, replaced by an icy and dangerous glare. "What? Vincent is heading to Luminara Group? Now?"

Erica quickly affirmed,"Yes."

"Who exactly is in Luminara Group?" Her apprehension mounted, pushing her to press again in urgency.

With a shadowed face, Claude responded, "Hannah works there."

"What? Why does Hannah work in Luminara Group, and why have you failed to keep her in check?" Erica's tone shot upward, sharpened with blame.

Claude's voice shifted into a severity never shown before, edged with warning. "Erica! Mind your words!Hannah has the freedom to be wherever she chooses, and it has nothing to do with you! Just handle what lies in front of you!"

Shaken by Claude's sudden rebuke, Erica was forced into sharp awareness by the frost and command in his words. The priority at this moment was resolving the current crisis.

"What's our next move? Vincent is already en route! Once he uncovers the truth, all our efforts will be in vain," she reminded him.

"Be silent!" Claude steadied himself, his thoughts racing furiously. "Now hear me! Get to Luminara Group without delay! Do everything possible to keep Vincent from reaching Hannah."

Claude ended the call, seized his car keys, and set out for Luminara Group. To ensure nothing went wrong,he planned to take Hannah away.

This predicament differed entirely from the previous confrontation in the private room; within the Luminara Group, Vincent could certainly recognize Hannah. That was an outcome Claude could not permit. ******

Meanwhile, just as the workday was nearing its close, a sudden storm was unleashed. And the downpour showed no intention of easing even after work hours.

Hannah lingered in the lobby by the revolving doors, a faint crease marking her brow as she studied the sheets of rain outside. Her vehicle had been taken for servicing two days earlier, leaving her without it today.

On the display of her phone, the ride-hailing app read: "152 people ahead in queue, estimated wait time exceeding 1 hour." She exhaled lightly, slipped the phone into her pocket, and allowed her gaze to drift over the other staff stuck in the lobby.

Several young women from different sections gathered, scrolling idly on their screens and muttering complaints about the storm and the endless delay for transportation.

Their stares occasionally flicked toward Natalie, carrying blatant judgment, intrigue, and a trace of jealousy mixed with contempt. The tale of Natalie's swift promotion to supervisor and the removal of Leonard had spread through the company like wildfire.

A fresh recruit who had climbed so quickly in under a month and drawn the "favor" of Adrian, the Vice President, was perfect fuel for chatter. Stories of Natalie's powerful ties and an unseen backer had long been created and distorted in break rooms and whispered chats.

"Ugh, this rain is unbearable! When will we even manage to get a ride?" Colleen Kyle from the Marketing Department deliberately lifted her voice, casting a glance in Natalie's direction.

"Exactly, it's maddening! I should've asked my boyfriend to fetch me!" Esme Bauer from the Finance Department followed up, her tone carrying a boasting edge.

Colleen's lips twisted into a sneer as she turned fully toward Natalie, raising her voice with an imitation of concern and curiosity. "Ms. Preston! With rain coming down like this, isn't your husband arriving to take you home?"

She stressed the word "husband," her gaze glittering with challenge and a flicker of malicious delight.

Hannah slowly pivoted upon hearing it. She refrained from replying at once, calmly nudging her black- framed glasses higher on her nose.

"I'm not married." Her words were crisp and even, stripped of inflection. "I've ordered a ride."

"Oh? Not married?" Colleen dragged out the syllables, feigning astonishment while trading looks with the women at her side, the derision on her face deepening. "Well, well... Then, Ms. Preston, why not have your boyfriend come for you?"

Their curiosity and envy about Natalie's supposed shadowy benefactor, who never appeared, spilled into their stares.

"Yes, Ms. Preston!" Esme echoed with mock sweetness,"lnrain like this, letting you wait alone shows how thoughtless he is, doesn't it?"

Hannah remained composed. "I don't have a boyfriend."

The employees from other departments exchanged glances, several stifling quiet laughter.

Esme abruptly raised her voice so the entire lobby could catch it.′′Oheavens, not even a title? Ms.Preston, could it be you're the mistress?"

Hannah's expression darkened.
###Chapter 420 Counterattack


"What are you suggesting?" Hannah's tone stayed level, yet a sudden frost overtook her eyes.

Observing the shift, Colleen instantly moved closer, her lips twisted into a counterfeit smile, though her stare burned harsher than before. "Exactly what it sounds like. You're still young, full of potential, climbing the ladder in no time-even Mr. Briggs shows you courtesy. Isn't that only because a sugar daddy stands behind you?"

"Ms. Preston, hardly anyone sees it as hidden," Jaclyn Brennan from the Product Department interjected,seizing the opportunity. "Why don't you have him come pick you up right now? Let's all witness what sort of man he is."

Hannah's gaze traveled slowly across the circle of whispering women. Her voice emerged soft but carried an unshakable edge. "Is this the way you normally tear people apart when their backs are turned?"

The grins worn by Colleen, Esme, and the others froze on the spot.

As the one leading them, Colleen felt the sting of exposure and tried to mask her alarm. She lifted her volume in a show of false boldness. "Ms. Preston, what accusation are you making? We're only showing care, that's it! How can you call that tearing people apart? If you'reclean,what are you so scared of?"

Staff from other departments joined in, echoing her claim.

Hannah tilted her chin slightly, her stare glacial. "Care? Your form of care is spitting out vile guesses about me? Branding me as 'kept by a sugar daddy' and 'riding on connections' without presenting evidence?"

"But we aren't off base, are we?" Colleen fired back, her pitch strained even as Natalie's look rattled her."Without a sugar daddy, how could you rise that fast? Jumping from newcomer to supervisor in only a single month-how is that natural? Can you swear no one smoothed your way in secpet?"

Esme summoned her nerve to add, her voice laced with venomous curiosity. "Exactly! We just want to meet your sugar daddy. Or is he a married man you dare not show to us?" Jaclyn followed with a sly curve of her lips. "That's quite possible! I've noticed Mr. Briggs calling Ms.Preston into his office often, and they remain there for hours behind a shut door! Who can tell what's happening inside?"

"Oh my!" Esme exaggerated the gesture of clapping a hand over her mouth, her eyes alive with ridicule and delight. "Mr. Briggs is a married man! Why does their department always tangle with married men? First, it was Marissa, and now it's Natalie! Almost like some rotten ritual over there."

The poisonous talk swelled into outright insults and defamation.

Hannah's features hardened in a heartbeat. She chose silence. To spar with women who wallowed in filth and lacked any boundaries was beneath her.

Without expression, Hannah pulled her phone out of her pocket, her motions steady and quick. Without glancing at a single face, her fingers flew across the screen, opening the corporation's most restricted internal system.

Immediately, the personal information pages of Colleen, Esme, Jaclyn, and the other chief instigators appeared-including their recent completion ratios, mistakes in assignments, and other details.

Hannah scanned the data and released a short, cold laugh. Lifting her eyes slowly, she singled out Colleen."Colleen from marketing, isn't it? Last quarter, your KPI rate hit only 67%. Due to errors in planning for the Morning Light promotion project, the client suffered losses, and three complaints were filed.You even exceeded the office supplies budget by 30% last month without justification."

Pausing, she added, "Esme, your last month's report contained three severe inaccuracies, forcing the entire team into overtime to correct it. Your supervisor rebuked you, yet your reporting still drips with flaws.Jaclyn, the test documentation for the product series you're responsible for arrived late for two straight weeks. On Friday, you even left work two hours early without notifying anyone."

With each name recited, with every detailed error-listing times, projects, and figures-the women drained of color, their bodies quivering against their will. They stared at Natalie as if struck, unable to fathom how she had unearthed their exact mistakes.

Hannah's stare cut like steel, her words soaked in scorn and warning. "Listen carefully-rather than wasting effort concocting lies and smears, you should patch the gaping holes in your own duties and improve you pathetic performance!"

Her tone bore absolute command. "Regarding Mr. Briggs and me, it is entirely professional! Nothing beyon that! Do you understand?"

Pinned down by Natalie's devastatingly accurate recital, Colleen felt herself unravel. Shamed and furious she lost all restraint and screamed, "Who can say? A man and a woman alone together! With the door shut For hours! Anything could have happened! You claim innocence-where's your evidence?"

Hannah stepped forward sharply, her presence surging until Colleen seemed crushed beneath it "Evidence? You hold evidence? Did you personally witness me sharing a bed with Calvin?"

Colleen's face drained, speechless.

Out of nowhere, someone whispered with a startled breath, "Stop talking-Mr. Miller just arrived."
###Chapter 421 Faced The Music


Every head turned instantly toward the elevator doors.

Adrian advanced with long strides, his features dark, exuding an aura of dominance.

Hannah's gaze flickered with astonishment when she noticed him.

Adrian's assistant had spotted Hannah cornered on the surveillance feed and, aware of Adrian's fierce protectiveness toward her, had reported it at once.
Adrian had been drowning in files inside his office when he received word that Hannah faced trouble, and his chest clenched. He'd abandoned his work instantly and hurried toward the lobby with all possible speed.

On arrival, Adrian's eyes swept over the assembly before resting on Hannah. He lengthened his stride toward her, yet before words could leave his mouth, Colleen stepped forth with fists tight.

Colleen's expression twisted with a deluded conviction as she raised her voice, sharp with rage. "Mr. Miller!Someone is misusing authority to pursue an improper relationship at the company, tarnishing its image!What action must be taken?"

Adrian halted, shifting his stare slowly toward Colleen, icy and piercing. His eyes narrowed faintly as he asked in a quiet, commanding tone, "Whom are you accusing?"

Colleen quivered beneath the weight of his gaze but forced herself onward, pointing at Natalie. "Ms.Preston! She and Mr. Briggs are entangled-they vanish into the office for hours! Many of us have witnessed it! This is unacceptable! This disgrace must not continue! Punishment is necessary!"

Colleen's confidence surged in her certainty of triumph. Adrian, so influential, would never allow such disgrace. Leonard had already lost his post for misconduct, and though Natalie had talent, she was only a supervisor-surely she would be penalized. Calvin, too, would not escape trouble this time either.

Colleen even convinced herself that Leonard had been dismissed for uncovering Natalie and Calvin's affair.
Hannah regarded Colleen's reckless, self-sabotaging outburst, cold amusement flashing inwardly. What idiocy.

Adrian heard Colleen's claims in silence, his face unreadable. He did notanswer immediately, instead directing his gaze toward Hannah, steady yet marked with unspoken inquiry and respect.

Hannah inclined her head slightly. Her eyes passed over Esme and the others, whose complexions had drained, before she spoke with measured composure. "Mr. Miller, what do company rules declare about rumor-mongering, defaming coworkers, and damaging corporate reputation?"

Adrian's tone was deep and authoritative. "Suspension until review. Serious breaches result in dismissal."

The pronouncement sent chills through the group. Many looked ghostly white.

Hannah's eyes returned to Colleen. "Did you hear that? Do you still wish to continue?"

Colleen's hand shook as she jabbed toward Hannah, her voice shrill and hysterical. "You-you're intimidating me? You think you can sway Mr. Miller? Mr. Miller! Don't be fooled by her!"

"Enough!" Adrian's command lashed out like steel.′′Are you responsible for spreading this tale, deliberately slandering Ms. Preston?"

"I-I didn't, Mr. Miller! I swear I didn't!" Colleen cried desperately, her tone breaking into sobs. "Everything I.said is the truth! You must believe me!"

She whirled toward the others in the lobby, screaming wildly, attempting to pull them into her storm, "Speak!Weren't you whispering just now? Speak up! Tell Mr. Miller! Didn't you see it too? Didn't you hear it? Say something!"

Yet,the few bystanders kept their heads lowered, frozen with dread, scarcely daring to breathe. How could they possibly respond?

Hannah tore her gaze from them and fixed it back on Adrian, her tone even and resolute. "Mr. Miller, enforce the regulations. Suspend or dismiss as appropriate."

"Understood." Adrian's reply was quick and firm. He lifted his hand, and his assistant immediately advanced, naming Colleen and several other agitators formally."The resolution will be delivered within twenty-four hours. Please vacate the building immediately and await notice at home."

Colleen collapsed, crushed, sobbing in defeat. Esme and the others also broke down, weeping and pleading in vain.

Adrian shifted toward Natalie, the frost on his expression easing into genuine concern and regard, his voice hushed. "Ms. Hale, has everything with Calvin been progressing well?"

Hannah's voice was low and composed. "His trust is with me now." Her eyes flicked toward the rain lashing against the glass. "All matters here are concluded. You can return."

Adrian quickly offered, "The rain's fierce-I can drive you-"

"No need. I've already arranged a ride." Hannah checked her phone screen. The driver has arrived.

She unfurled a plain long-handled umbrella, pushed the door open, and moved straight toward the cab stationed at the roadside.

Without warning, a figure surged forward and seized Hannah's wrist. It was Vincent. He called out instinctively,"Hannah!"
###Chapter 422 Confirmation


Hannah jerked her hand hard, trying to wrench it free from Vincent's grip. "Why are you here? Let go!"

Vincent didn't release her. Instead, his hold tightened. Ignoring her resistance, he demanded,"Are you working at the Luminara Group?"

"That's none of your business!" Hannah's voice shook with suppressed anger as she twisted in his grasp.The umbrella slipped in their tug-of-war, and rain instantly drenched her shoulder.

"We need to talk," Vincent declared, his tone resolute, allowing no room for dissent.

"I have already said all I needed to at Cloudtop Restaurant," Hannah shot back, her gaze piercing through the rain-soaked strands of her hair. "Did throwing that glass of wine in your face still not make my stance clear?"

Vincent froze at that. He studied her, defiant and unyielding in the downpour, a stark contrast to the "Hannah" currently dining at the Jones estate. There were two Hannahs now. And he was gripped by an unshakable certainty that the woman before him was the true Hannah.

His voice trembled with raw emotion as he loosened his hold. "You're the real Hannah, aren't you?" he murmured.

Hannah's brows knitted in frustration as she finally freed her hand. "This is ridiculous!"

She refused to meet his gaze again, yanking open the car door and slipping inside with a forceful slam."Drive, now!" Her voice rang with urgent finality.

The taxi driver glanced at the striking man standing in the rain through the rearview mirror and then at Hannah's icy demeanor in the backseat."Miss,did you two argue? Your boyfriend is still out there in the rain.Should we wait?"

"I have no ties with him," Hannah replied, her tone sharp and unwavering."Drive!" "Alright, alright!" Startled by her intensity, the driver hesitated no longer and pulled away.

The taxi merged into the rain-slicked traffic, water streaking across the windows.

Vincent spun on his heel, sprinting to his car. He ignited the engine and trailed the taxi closely.

Rain pounded the windshield, and despite the wipers' frantic pace, the road ahead remained a blur.

Vincent's hands clenched the steering wheel, his pulse thundering in his chest.

Hannah sank back in her seat, eyes closed, drawing a slow, steadying breath.

The driver, noticing the sleek luxury car doggedly pursuing them, spoke again. "Miss, that car's sticking close. It's risky driving like this in the storm. Are you sure everything's fine?"

Hannah's eyes flicked open, catching the familiar vehicle in the rearview mirror. Her expression wavered,layered with complexity. After a moment, her voice softened, laced with weary determination. "Just ignore him."

The driver gave a resigned nod. "Got it."

The taxi pressed on, halting at the entrance to Sterling Heights.

Vincent's car slowed to a stop beside it. He flung open his door and hurried to catch up with Hannah.

Sterling Heights 2201 was Hannah's property. Even during her travels abroad, Vincent had ensured it remained untouched. More importantly, she had enabled iris recognition. No impostor could cross its threshold. Only the true Hannah could.

Vincent followed silently until sheactivated the iris scanner.

Unable to contain herself any longer, Hannah spun to face him. "I'm home. Are you still going to stalk me?"

She had noticed him trailing her since she stepped out of the taxi but had held her tongue. She hadn't expected him to linger even after she unlocked the door.

She opened her mouth to deliver a sharper retort, but in an instant, Vincent pulled her into a fierce embrace.He was nearly certain she was his Hannah.His arms enveloped her tightly, as if he could fuse their beings into one. "I thought you'd never return," he whispered, his voice cracking with raw grief and boundless regret.

"I'm sorry..." Vincent repeated the words, his voice fractured, heavy with a profound, soul-deep ache. He vowed silently that he would never let her go. Not even in death
###Chapter 423 A Woman Exists With Your Exact Face


"Enough!" Hannah strained against Vincent, resistance proving useless until she abruptly shifted strategy.Channeling her disciplined power through an exact sequence of shoulder jerks, waist pivots, and knee drives, she wrenched herself free of Vincent's grip.

Vincent faltered in surprise. The embrace he had clamped around her collapsed as her relentless force pried him open. His towering figure stumbled backward, losing stability, creating a cutting span of space between them.

"Weren't you the one who told me to go far out of your sight?" Her tone sliced with frost. "Didn't you tell me never to appear before you again? And now you pursue me to my doorstep, clutching at me-what's your aim? To cage me again? Let me remind you, I'm not the same woman I used to be."

She had secured a judo black belt and never let her training slip. She was no longer a target for domination.

Vincent's chest tightened with a stabbing ache beneath the weight of her glare and cutting words. He hurried to defend himself, though his protest rang fragile and hollow. "I thought it wasn't you back then, so my words were cruel. Forgive me."

"What do you mean, it wasn't me?" Hannah's brow furrowed, bewilderment flickering as she seized upon the critical clue.

"Let's talk inside..." His voice was low, edged with plea. Rain soaked her clothes, and his only thought was for her to change first.

"We'll settle this right here!" Hannah retorted, her stance unbending.

Vincent refrained from arguing on this. He pronounced each syllable with grave precision. "In Dorbarrow,a woman exists with your exact face."

"That's impossible!" Hannah gasped, eyes widening on Vincent with stunned disbelief.

"If it were the result of plastic surgery, then it's entirely possible." Vincent's reply was flat, unwavering. Hannah's pulse plunged. Someone had actually gone under the knife to become her spitting image? Her fingers dug into the umbrella shaft. "Why would she want to look exactly like me? What's she after?"

"Up to now, her purpose appears to be approaching me." Vincent's gaze narrowed, his tone crisp and calculating.

Another woman pretending to be her simply to draw near Vincent? Hannah's thoughts darted toward a single suspect. "Is it Brinley?"

She wondered if Brinley had already been out of prison.

"No." Vincent's interruption was sharp and decisive. "I verified-Brinley still remains in an international prison."

A heavier unease gripped Hannah. If Brinley was excluded, then who could this double be?

Vincent caught the turmoil clouding her stare, paused, and then revealed more. "And Claude... He's acquainted with that woman. Their tie is not ordinary. Be careful."

"Why would Claude be linked to that impostor? That's absurd!" Hannah reeled, struggling to take it in.

"Regardless, stay cautious with Claude!" Vincent warned firmly. These were fragments he had pieced together during the pursuit.

A dense stillness settled between them.

Vincent eventually edged closer, his words shaded with concern. "How have you managed this past year?"

Hannah snapped from her daze, shoving the umbrella against his chest to hold him back. "Don't move another step." Her lips curled with derision. "You're asking because you hope l've suffered, aren't you?"

Vincent parted his lips, only to find himself at a loss for words. "No..." His reply rasped, rough and broken.

Hannah averted her gaze. The avalanche of disclosures left her exhausted. She needed solitude to regain balance and absorb it all.

Pivoting away, she entered and bolted the door. Vincent lingered outside, his voice carrying stubborn gentleness. "When do you leave for work tomorrow?I'll drive you."

Hannah ignored the offer. Her cold dismissal slipped through the barrier. "Go now, or I'Il summon security."

Vincent hesitated briefly before departing. The impostor's real face was still unknown. For now, his only choice was to contain her and block any further disruption.
###Chapter 424 They Had Already Met


Traffic crawled at a snail's pace, trapping Claude's car for nearly an hour before he finally reached the entrance of the Luminara Group.

Evening had settled in past eight o'clock, and Hannah was nowhere to be found inside.

Stepping out of the lobby,Claude unexpectedly spotted Erica. Her face mirrored Hannah's perfectly, yet he still knew instantly this wasn't her.

Claude's brows knitted together, irritation flashing in his eyes. "What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you to stop Vincent?"

Frustration flickered across Erica's features. "You think I didn't want to stop him? If I could reach him,I wouldn't come here."

"Couldn't reach him?" Dread settled in Claude's chest as his gaze sharpened. "Vincent and Hannah must've already met!"

Though startled, Erica quickly analyzed the situation. "During the self-staged kidnapping incident, our performance was so convincing! Moreover, Sharon adores me. Surely, Vincent must believe I'm the real Hannah. And Hannah goes by Natalie now, doesn't she? Vincent probably thinks she's the impostor and that Natalie is her true name."

Dark smirk crossed Claude's features. "You've certainly done your homework." WNithin such a short time,Erica had discovered Hannah's alias at the Luminara Group.

Silent calculations continued behind Erica's eyes. Hannah's very existence still posed a threat. If only she could disappear entirely...

Ignoring Erica completely, Claude pulled out his phone and dialed Hannah's number.

The phone rang several times before connecting. Hello? Claude?" Weariness tinged Hannah's voice.

Concern immediately softened Claude's tone. "Anna? Rain's pouring down out here. I got worried and came to the Luminara Group to pick you up, but you've already left?"

"Yes, I did," Hannah answered calmly. "Caught a taxi home."

"That's good!" Relief washed through Claude, though unease still nagged at him. He probed tentatively,"Nothing happened on the way,right?"

"Nothing," Hannah replied quickly, deciding against mentioning meeting Vincent.

Claude pressed on. "Did Vincent come looking for you?"

Silence stretched across the line.

Suspicion immediately crept into Hannah's thoughts. How did Claude know Vincent had sought her out?Several seconds passed before she answered, "Yes, he did. Just like before, he spouted some confusing nonsense and left. Quite rude, actually." She revealed only fragments of the truth.

Claude listened, feeling somewhat reassured. It seemed Vincent still hadn't recognized the true Hannah.Perhaps he'd overestimated Vincent's understanding of Hannah. Even after five years of marriage, Vincent couldn't identify the real Hannah.

An almost imperceptible smile softened Claude's features, and his voice grew gentler. "Just ignore him. He's acting crazy. Get some rest early tonight. Winter's approaching, so bundle up and don't catch cold. Call me if you need anything at all."

"Okay, I will. Thanks, Claude." Hannah's reply came automatically, though her mind buzzed with unanswered questions.

Claude ended the call and released a slow breath. Turning toward Erica, who watched him with expectant eyes, he spoke quietly. ""As you wished. Vincent really seems to believe youI′r。Hannah."

He opted against revealing more.

Triumph blazed across Erica's features in a radiant smile. Dawn broke the following morning as Vincent drove toward Sterling Heights. Outside apartment 2201,he waited patiently,clutching a delicate insulated bag. Inside lay a freshly prepared crab omelet and warm milk -Hannah's former favorites.

Minutes crawled past.

Finally, the door opened. Hannah stepped out and immediately saw Vincent.

"Morning," Vincent greeted.

"You again?" Distance colored her tone.

Unfazed by her clear dislike for him, Vincent stepped closer and extended the insulated bag. "Brought you breakfast. Crab omelet-you used to love it."

Hannah glanced at the bag, her gaze devoid of emotion, her voice icy. "I already had my breakfast."

Walking past Vincent toward the elevator leading to the underground garage, she heard his footsteps trailing behind.

He offered, "I drove here.Let me give you a ride."

"I have my own car and can drive myself," Hannah stated firmly.

The elevator chimed open. Hannah walked out of the elevator and straight to the vehicle that had been serviced and delivered the previous night. Without hesitation, she slipped into the driver's seat.

Vincent pressed his palm against the window. "Please, let me do something for you."
###Chapter 425 Plan


Hannah's hands on the steering wheel faltered for a brief moment. She turned her head slowly, her eyes settling on Vincent's face through the car window.

Her gaze carried a storm of emotions. "Vincent, if you're doing all this to make up for what you've done to me a year ago, don't bother. It only makes me feel troubled. Besides, nothing you do now will undo your actions."

With those words, she looked away. Her foot pressed hard on the gas, and the car sped off.

Vincent remained standing there, clutching the delicate insulated bag so tightly that his knuckles turned white. He stared after the disappearing car, his eyes clouded with bitterness.

...

Instead of heading straight to the company after leaving Sterling Heights, Vincent wandered aimlessly.Hannah's cold, unyielding words from this morning echoed in his mind, her piercing gaze still imprinted on his heart.

The sting of loss, bitterness, and frustration surged within him. Yet, in the end, all of it settled into a steady,determined resolve.

Pulling out his phone, he dialed Erica's number.

"Hello? Mr. Jones?" Erica's voice came through, carrying a deliberate imitation of Hannah's cooI tone.She hadn't expected Vincent to reach out to her.

Vincent spoke evenly,his voice calm and controlled, tinged with polite warmth.′′My/ grandma hasn't been feeling well lately. If you're free, could you come by my family's house this afternoon to keep her company?"

Ecstasy rushed through Erica. Vincent had invited her to the Jones family residence! That meant he trusted she was Hannah. She suppressed her excitement and replied with a voice that retained its coolness, "I'll think about it. If I'm free,I'll come over."

"Alright," Vincent replied flatly and then ended the call.

Leaning back in his chair, he closed his eyes, the corner of his lips curling into a cold, faint smile. The bait had been set. The fish would surely bite.

Later that afternoon, in the Jones family's house, Sharon reclined comfortably on the soft sofa while Erica sat beside her, fussing over her with warm attentiveness, offering drinks and desserts with practiced affection.

"Hannah, having you here makes me so happy!" Sharon clasped Erica's hand, her face lighting with relief and joy. "Vincent finally realized he should invite you here. This house feels too empty without you."

"Sharon, please don't say that. Just focus on your health, and I'll visit you as often as I can." Erica's tone was sweet, though a flicker of triumph gleamed in her eyes. At that moment, she felt her place in the Jones family was secure.

Around four o'clock, the living room door swung open. Vincent stepped inside. His gaze flicked over Erica,who sat nestled beside his grandmother, a faint chill flashing in his eyes.

"Vincent!" Sharon called out cheerfully, beckoninghim with a smile. "Come and sit beside me! Hannah has been keeping me company."

Vincent moved to the sofa and took a seat, his eyes lingering briefly on Erica. "Grandma needs peace for her recovery andcan't be left alone. Would you consider living here to keep her company? That way, you'll avoid the hassle of commuting."

"What?" Erica froze, her eyes widening in disbelief, though delight flickered just beneath the surface. Was he really asking her to live at the Jones family residence?

She forced herself to keep calm, swallowing down her excitement. She couldn't afford to look too pleased.She had to play the role.

Like Hannah would, she put on an expression that was just the right mix of hesitation and reluctance. "Is this really okay? It feels like imposing on you. Besides, I already have a place to stay."

"Not at all" Sharon clutched her hand warmly, her eyes glowing with anticipation. "Sweetheart, stay! I would be so happy to have you here!"

"But... Erica lowered her gaze, pretending to hesitate once more, sneaking a glance at Vincent as if seeking his opinion.

Watching her carefully staged performance, Vincent smirked internally. His expression, however, remained composed."My grandma likes you. If your living here makes her happy and helps her recover faster, then it's decided."

Sharon nodded eagerly. "Yes, it's settled."

Though Erica tried to decline several more times out of"pOoliteness," she finally agreed under Sharon's gentle insistence.

Sharon's face lit up, her heart clearly put at ease.

Vincent soon mentioned he had other matters to attend to and excused himself from the living room.

Every bit of this was part of his plan. It was far safer to keep a dangerous person within reach until his people unearthed this woman's true identity.

Over the next two days, Vincent visited Hannah daily. Yet, no matter how often he came, she kept her distance,refusing to let him in.

One afternoon, Vincent deliberately gathered some of Hannah's old belongings from the estate she had lived in a year ago. He intended for returning them to be his excuse to get closer to her.

But when he reached her neighborhood, his car was stopped before it could even enter the garage.

A security guard stepped forward, looking apologetic. "I'm sorry, sir. We just received a complaint from a resident saying your vehicle poses a security risk to the community. You're not allowed to drive inside.I hope you can understand."

Vincent didn't need to ask who had made the complaint. He knew instantly-it was Hannah.
###Chapter 426 What Exactly Was Their Relationship


Hannah received a call from property management, informing her that Vincent's vehicle had been barred from accessing Sterling Heights. For the past few days, Vincent had finally ceased waiting outside her door,giving her some much-needed peace.

Meanwhile, since the confrontation in the lobby amid the torrential rainfall, an uneasy quiet had hung over the departments.

Adrian had directly intervened, swiftly imposing punishment on several staff members who had circulated harmful gossip and defamation. Colleen and Esme were dismissed immediately, while others, including Jaclyn, were placed on suspension under review.

This development rattled the entire workplace, plunging them into collective nervousness. The chatter surrounding Natalie's sudden rise in rank and her association with Calvin vanished completely. Speculation spread that Adrian might, in fact, be Natalie's secret financial backer.

Inevitably, such talk reached Calvin. If that rumor proved accurate, then all the shady dealings he and Leonard had been involved in-the tampering of warehouse ledgers, siphoning profits from faulty goods,exaggerating deficits, pocketing bribes-even the current manipulations within the Stellink Plan-were unfolding right under Adrian's supervision?

A chilling dread overtook Calvin. He felt as though the very structure around him was collapsing inward. He resolved that he must uncover the truth regarding Natalie and Adrian's relationship.

Pushing back his unease, Calvin masked himself with his standard commanding demeanor and pressed the intercom. "Natalie, step into my office."

When Hannah entered Calvin's office, she instantly perceived that something was unusual. Although Calvin wore a grin, it failed to reach his eyes.

"Mr. Briggs, you asked for me?" Hannah said steadily, approaching his desk. Calvin withheld an instant reply. He instead picked up an arbitrary weekly file from the desk, skimmed it without interest, and then flung it before her with visible displeasure. "Natalie, review this. The data stream optimization report for this assignment was turned in two days ago, yet l've still not received the final version. Your pace appears somewhat inadequate."

Hannah smirked inwardly. He was plainly fabricating fault. The document had actually been delivered only yesterday. She stayed composed, bowing her head slightly. "Forgive me, Mr. Briggs. That was my mistake.I finalized it yesterday afternoon and intended to carefully verify the figures this morning before submitting it to you later today. I'll handle it immediately and ensure you have the finished draft by the end of the day."

Calvin responded with a dismissive grunt, reclining in his seat, his stare locked on her expression.

Abruptly, he redirected the subject, his manner adopting a pretense of concern. "Natalie, it appears you've been getting a bit too full of yourself of late."

Hannah lifted her gaze in staged puzzlement, her tone edged with inquiry. "Mr. Briggs, what exactly are you suggesting? I don't quite follow. Have there been shortcomnings in my performance?"

Calvin's eyes grew sharper. "Your output is outstanding, remnarkably so. In fact, it's so remarkable that I'm left to wonder whether you've confided in Mr. Miller about our dealings."

Hannah's brow twitched. Was this a deliberate probe? She widened her eyes in measured alarm, her tone urgent. "Mr. Briggs, why did you entertain such a notion? Why would I ever disclose anything to Mr. Miller? If he becomes aware, both of us are finished! Moreover, I barely know Mr. Miller."

"Barely know him?" Calvin's disbelief was evident, suspicion etched in his gaze. "Then why is he extending you so much protection? That clash in the first-floor lobby-several departments ganged up on you, and it got prettyserious! In the end, Mr. Miller personally stepped in to sort it out. At that day, you appeared to have Mr. Miller in the palm of your hand!"

Hannah sneered inwardly. Clearly, Calvin remained hung up on Adrian's intervention that day. She adopted a look of weary resignation, her tone laced with self-deprecation. "Mr. Briggs, you're giving me way too much credit! I'm only a modest supervisor. How could I possibly command Mr. Miller? He's simply rigid about procedures and corporate policy. I merely exploited that. I presented the internal codes alongside evidence of those employees' violations, compelling Mr. Miller to act according to regulations." Her explanation carried a convincing logic, polished and persuasive.

Yet, Calvin remained unconvinced. Even so, he acted like he accepted it-for the time being. Secretly,he had already laid a snare, prepared for her inevitable misstep.
###Chapter 427| Can Help You Get Promoted


Mock admiration laced Calvin's voice as he spoke. "Natalie, you really know how to play people like a fiddle!Not bad."

Hannah quietly breathed a sigh of relief, her face showing a cooperatively humble smile. "You're too kind,Mr.Briggs."

Calvin shifted the topic, leaning slightly forward as he pulled a new document from the drawer, pushing it toward her with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "By the way, the Starlink Project launched recently.A batch of data needs your attention. Quite simple, really. Just adjust the cost-sharing ratios here a bit and optimize the wastage rate a little.Understand?"

Taking the document, Hannah's eyes quickly scanned the highlighted data. The same old game of falsifying figures, inflating costs, and embezzling funds stared back at her. Now, however, the stakes were higher,and the risks were greater! Calvin finally included her in such shady deals.

Neutral composure masked her thoughts as she showed a hint of understanding and caution. Voice dropping low, she responded, "Understood, Mr. Briggs. I'll handle it neatly."

Satisfaction spread across Calvin's features, his smile widening. "Great! Once this document is dealt with,thirty thousand will be immediately transferred to your account."

"Much appreciated, Mr. Briggs!" Hannah responded, feigning gratitude while securing the document.Inwardly,ice filled her veins. This was yet another piece of evidence.

Before departing, Hannah ventured carefully, manufactured greed glinting in her expression, "Mr. Briggs, Vincent's Bentley began to slow deliberately, easing slightly into her lane.

His gaze was razor-sharp, calculating speed and angle. Just as her car neared his rear, he yanked the wheel and slammed the brakes.

Bang! A thunderous crash echoed through the air.

Using the Bentley's weight and robust brakes, Vincent forced Hannah's runaway car to a grinding halt.

Tendrils of white smoke curled from the hood, the ground scorched where tires had skidded.

Hannah lurched forward from the impact, only to be snapped back by her seatbelt. Her chest ached, and a ringing filled her ears.

Her car door flew open. Vincent was at her side in an instant, nearly diving to reach her."Are you okay? Any injuries?"

He reached out, carefully unbuckling her seatbelt and helping her out of the wrecked car.

Vincent inspected her, seeing no external injuries. "Move a little. Anywhere hurt badly?"

With his support, Hannah straightened up slowly. She took a few tentative steps and shook her head."I'm fine... Nothing serious."

Gathering her strength, she approached her mangled car, crouched down, and inspected the brake system.

She quickly found the problem; the brake fluid line had been deliberately severed, leaking every drop. This was no malfunction-it was sabotage, a calculated attempt on her life.

A shiver crawled down her spine. She reached for her phone to document the evidence, only to find its battery dead. "Can I use your phone?" she asked Vincent, her voice urgent. "Someone tampered with my brakes. I need to take pictures!"

Vincent's eyes turned cold as steel. He handed her his phone without a word.°

Hannah snapped pictures from every angle. Finished, she exhaled shakily and returned the phone. "Thank you. Can you call someone to pick us up? Derek, or anyone?"
Vincent's expression sharpened as he moved closer, invisible authority radiating from him. "Consider carefully.Are you truly satisfied remaining a mere supervisor given your talents?"

Ice crystallized in Hannah's stare. "Your offer is generous, Mr. Jones, but completely unwanted.My current role suits me perfectly. Please step aside."

Attempting to sidestep him proved futile.

Vincent remained planted, his gaze razor-sharp. "What if I tell you that Jones Group and Luminara Group are about to embark on a high-profile joint venture, and I can grant you the role of the sole project lead?This opportunity could rocket you straight to Luminara Group's executive level! Interested now?"

Not a flicker of temptation crossed Hannah's features. "Still not." Without another glance at Vincent, she clicked her key fob, slipped into the driver's seat, and slammed the door.

The engine roared to life as she floored the accelerator and sped away.

Vincent exhaled slowly before pursuing her.

Hannah maintained steady speed on the Sterling Heights route.

Approaching an uphill stretch, she pressed the brake pedal for the usual slowdown, but it plunged to the floor with zero resistance. No deceleration followed.

Another desperate pump of the brakes yielded nothing.

The truth hit like lightning: her brakes had failed. Who was behind this now?
###Chapter 428 Her Car's Brakes Have Failed


À cold sweat drenched Hannah's back in an instant. She fought to keep her composure, her hands clamping the steering wheel tightly.

At that moment, her phone buzzed frantically, a familiar number flashing across the screen. Without hesitation, she answered the call.

Vincent's voice flooded the car, steady and warm."|didn't change my number. Didn't think you'd pick up.How about dinner tonight? We can talk about-"

He was still pitching that project, assuming it could spark her interest.

But Hannah cut him off, "Vincent! My brakes aren't working! Is there a quieter road nearby?"

The line fell deathly silent.

Suddenly, a piercing screech of tires against the asphalt driveway erupted behind her. A sleek black Bentley Mulsanne roared past, surging ahead with breathtaking speed.

Vincent's voice crackled through the speaker, calm but commanding. "Follow me. Keep your distance, steer carefully, and stay calm!"

Hannah's pulse pounded in her chest. She understood his plan. Gritting her teeth, she locked her eyes on the Bentley's glowing taillights, fighting to maintain control and stay close.

Vincent's mind raced as he swerved onto a straighter side road. This was their chance.

Hannah mirrored his turn, guiding her car onto the nearly deserted road.

"Open space ahead!" Vincent's voice remained steady, unshaken. "I'm going to stop your car. Brace yourself!"

"Got it!" Hannah's grip tightened on the wheel. Vincent's Bentley began to slow deliberately, easing slightly into her lane.

His gaze was razor-sharp, calculating speed and angle. Just as her car neared his rear, he yanked the wheel and slammed the brakes.

Bang! A thunderous crash echoed through the air.

Using the Bentley's weight and robust brakes, Vincent forced Hannah's runaway car to a grinding halt.

Tendrils of white smoke curled from the hood, the ground scorched where tires had skidded.

Hannah lurched forward from the impact, only to be snapped back by her seatbelt. Her chest ached, and a ringing filled her ears.

Her car door flew open. Vincent was at her side in an instant, nearly diving to reach her."Are you okay? Any injuries?"

He reached out, carefully unbuckling her seatbelt and helping her out of the wrecked car.

Vincent inspected her, seeing no external injuries. "Move a little. Anywhere hurt badly?"

With his support, Hannah straightened up slowly. She took a few tentative steps and shook her head."I'm fine... Nothing serious."

Gathering her strength, she approached her mangled car, crouched down, and inspected the brake system.

She quickly found the problem; the brake fluid line had been deliberately severed, leaking every drop. This was no malfunction-it was sabotage, a calculated attempt on her life.

A shiver crawled down her spine. She reached for her phone to document the evidence, only to find its battery dead. "Can I use your phone?" she asked Vincent, her voice urgent. "Someone tampered with my brakes. I need to take pictures!"

Vincent's eyes turned cold as steel. He handed her his phone without a word.°

Hannah snapped pictures from every angle. Finished, she exhaled shakily and returned the phone. "Thank you. Can you call someone to pick us up? Derek, or anyone?"Both cars were wrecked, and the remote location ruled out hailing a cab.

Vincent noddedd, intending to make a call, but his attempts were met with failure-no signal.

He tried again in vain, frustration mounting, and then looked at Hannah, whose face had grown even paler.His chest tightened, and he made a decisive call. "No signal out here. You don't look well. We need to find a place to rest."

Hannah shook her head, her voice stubborn despite her frailty. "I'm fine. Just dizzy. I can manage."

Vincent, seeing her weakened state, slipped off his warm cashmere coat and gently draped it over her shoulders.

Hannah tried to protest. "I'm not cold."

"Now's not the time to play tough," Vincent insisted.

Hannah relented, pulling the coat tighter around her.

Seeing her accept it, Vincent's expression softened, though his urgency remained. "Stay here and don't move. I'm going to check those houses ahead to see if we can stay or at least make a call."

He pointed to a cluster of farmhouse courtyards glowing faintly in the distance.

Hannah, clutching his coat, hesitated. "I'll come with you."

As darkness deepened, the thought of being alone unnerved her.

Together, they approached one of the homes. Before they got close, the sharp sound of something being struck rang out from within.
###Chapter 429 Misunderstanding


A woman's shrill howls and anguished cries reverberated without pause, mixed with the sobbing of a frightened child.

"You vile woman! How dare you still protect this worthless brat?" A man's harsh and brutal bellow exploded,trailed instantly by a sharp "slap!" and the woman's agonized moan.

"I'll beat you to death!"

Hannah's once-clouded thoughts snapped fully awake-this was unmistakably domestic abuse. Without hesitation, she sprinted toward the dwelling.

Vincent instinctively moved to restrain her, but she darted ahead too swiftly. He rushed in right after her.

By luck, the door was unlocked.

Inside, a man was wrenching the hair of a woman whose face bore glaring, swollen palm prints and whose hair hung wildly in disarray. Splintered shards covered the floor. A small girl, no older than six, crouched in a corner,weeping in dread.

The man's other arm hovered above her, prepared to strike once more.

"Stop!" Hannah yelled fiercely, and as his baffled stare landed on her, she tightened her fist and slammed it into his nose.

"Argh!" Tom Smith shrieked in torment as blood gushed from his nostrils.

He staggered backward, holding his face, gaping at the sudden appearance of Hannah in disbelief."You...Who are you?" His words slurred.

Hannah ignored him, instead hurrying to steady the trembling, petrified woman, Nadia Becker. "Don't be afraid! We're taking you away from here!"

Tom froze briefly, and then, ignoring the blood streaming down his nose, jabbed a finger at Hannah and snarled, "Who the hell are you? Why are you dragging my wife off? This is my family's business. Back away from it!"

As he ranted, he rushed over in fury.

Hannah caught his wrist mnid-swing and twisted sharply, while Vincent used the chance to drive a kick into him.

Tom screamed in anguish, writhing on the floor, mucus, tears, and blood streaking his swollen face.

Hannah glared icily, wondering if he would dare strike his wife again after this.

"Impressive skills," Vincent muttered, his eyes on Hannah.

Hannah dusted off her hands. "Just got some training."

Vincent's eyes flickered. In that moment, she reminded him of her earlier, more assertive self.

Hannah turned her gaze toward the little girl huddled in the corner, softening her tone. "It's all right now,sweetheart."

"Hey, I am the injured one here!" Tom groaned from the floor, struggling to lift his battered head, his face mottled and swollen with misery. "Director! You never said there would be actual blows! And wasn't the script supposed to have only the female lead seized by me? Who's this man? He's not even written in!"

Director? Script? Hannah and Vincent exchanged a swift look, their eyes wide with disbelief and absurdity.A blunder? Were they interrupting a production?

Hannah quickly scanned the room but saw no obvious lights, cameras, or crew. "Something is wrong..."she whispered to Vincent, her expression sharp. "We should get out now!"

Vincent agreed, moving toward the little girl still curled in the corner.

But then, a voice rang out.

"Cut!" The director, who had been wwatching through a monitor, finally reacted after Tom had been pummeled badly, realizing the intruders were not part of the cast. He seized the walkie-talkie, his voice brimmning with fury, echoing unnaturally through a hidden loudspeaker in the yard. "What the hell just happened? Who are you two? How did you barge into this place?"

As the words faded, from several unnoticed corners of the yard, eight figures in plain clothes suddenly stepped out. At the front was a man of middle age, capped and dressed in a director's jacket.

The director strode toward Hannah and Vincent, sizing them up with keen eyes, noting their striking appearance.

Vincent moved in front of Hannah protectively.

Tom, still gripping his bleeding nose, dragged himself toward the director, complaining miserably: "Director,they aren't from our crew! I got thrashed for nothing! The pain is killing me. I demand an extra payment for today's shoot, plus medical coverage!"

The director brushed him aside impatiently, still staring at Hannah and Vincent. "Fine, fine! You'll be paid.Step aside!"

Hannah managed a small apologetic smile and explained, "Sorry. We were just passing by. We heard a commotion inside and thought it was domestic violence. So we charged in recklessly. And the woman stayed silent throughout. I thought terror kept her quiet. I'll handle the medical costs for this actor."

Nadia whispered faintly after hearing Hannah mention her, "The director said I only need to cry and endure hits, no lines."

Hannah smiled apologetically once more. "We'll leave right away."

The director studied Hannah and Vincent for a long pause before declaring, "I'm afraid leaving isn't possible."

Vincent's expression grew grim.
###Chapter 430 Playing A Loving Couple


Vincent's presence radiated a sudden frost that weighed heavily in the air. He advanced a step, silently shielding Hannah behind him. Clearly, something was wrong with this film crew.

Hannah's chest tightened as she also perceived a powerful warning of looming danger. These people probably weren't up to any good-they had inevitably gotten into trouble.

Just as the unease reached its height, Vincent's fingers subtly contracted, prepared for any abrupt escalation.

The director broke into another laugh. Yet this time, his grin carried the sharp wit and shrewdness befitting a calculating merchant. Unhurried, he withdrew a finely designed business card from his coat and extended it to Vincent, remarking, "Calm down! Calm down! What I'm pointing out is that fate arranged our meetingat this place. What a striking gentleman, and what a beautiful lady! Would you consider joining my company as actors? If you're willing, I guarantee you both will be leading stars in our next film! How does that sound? It's a rare chance countless people would claw their way to obtain!"

Hearing such words, Tom and Nadia, who had been desperate for an opportunity like this, cast jealous glances toward Vincent and Hannah.

Vincent and Hannah traded a brief look, each recognizing in the other the same surprise and a slightly ridiculous sense of relief. They were invited to their film crew for their good looks. And the crew had no intention of detaining them.

Hannah let out an imperceptible breath and shook her head, declining politely. "Appreciate it, but that path isn't within my career plans."

The director, unbothered, shifted his focus toward Vincent with even brighter expectation. "And you? Young man,with your appearance and nice build, join us, and I assure you fame will follow!"

Vincent's expression stayed stone-like, his reply distant and cold. "Not interested." The actors nearby reacted with shock, especially Tom and Nadia.

The director's grin wavered faintly, yet he clearly wasn't ready to stop trying. Changing his approach, he continued, "How about doing me a small favor? Just a short scene for a few minutes! The script needs a loving pair, and you two seem like a couple. You could simply act as you normally do."

"You're mistaken. He and I are not a couple," Hannah corrected immediately. "We can't help."

But Vincent changed his mind and suddenly said, "Why not? We had been husband and wife for five years,hadn't we?"

That statement stirred the quiet crew into murmurs, gasps, and teasing laughter. Their gazes filled with gossip and curiosity.

Hannah knit her brows, confused at Vincent's abrupt willingness to cooperate with the film crew.

The director, sensing Vincent's potential consent, lit up with excitement and turned pleading eyes to Hannah. "See, he's agreed! Could you do me a favor? I'll arrange a car to send you back immediately after shooting! How does that sound? Out here, there's no taxi to be found, correct?"

Hannah met Vincent's gaze and replied firmly, "If he's set on acting, find him another actress. Count me out."

Vincent reached out and clasped Hannah's wrist. "The only one I want is you."

"Yes, yes!" the director chimed in quickly, face brimming with mirth and tone edged with playful teasing.
"Only you can embody his wife's role. No one else can deliver that feeling!"

Hannah flashed the director an annoyed look.

Sensing her displeasure at being paired with Vincent, the director hurriedly clarified, "I meant only for the role on screen! When it's done, I'll have a car ready to send you back immediately! You have my word!"

Hannah exhaled.Dragging it out longer was pointless. They did need a ride back at that moment.

At last, Hannah relented. "Wonderful!" the director exclaimed with delight, instantly instructing the crew assistant. "Quickly! Get them into the wardrobe and apply light makeup!"

The short script portrayed Vincent and Hannah as a couple married for a year, college friends of the film's main leads.

Their scenes together carried sweetness, yet the filming process proved difficult. Hannah stumbled repeatedly, as the director noted her eyes lacked affection.

As exhaustion grew, the director adjusted the plan, switching focus to close shots of Vincent.

The sequence closed with Hannah resting lightly against Vincent.

Crew members laughed, remarking how naturally suited they looked as partners.

When the director finally called the shoot to a close, Hannah instantly sprang from Vincent's arms as if burned by sudden flame. The gentle smile disappeared, replaced with her usual aloofness.

Vincent observed her rapid shift, sorrow flickering briefly in his gaze before he composed himself again.

A producer watching the monitor repeated her comments about how perfect Vincent and Hannah seemed together. She even asked Hannah, "Your husband isremarkably handsome. Why did you get divorced? Such a waste!"
###Chapter 431 Can't Keep Him Out


Vincent naturally caught the inquiry. His eyes were fixed on Hannah, waiting for her reply with expectation.

Hannah, wearing a blank face, corrected the producer firmly. "Not husband. He is my ex-husband."

She paused slightly before continuing, "He cheated."

It was obvious she was addressing the producer's question about their separation.

"What?" The producer's expression widened in disbelief and sympathy. "With such a wonderful wife, he strayed? Has this man lost his senses..."

Vincent's commanding,resonant tone broke through the producer's statement."I did not!"

He advanced, confronting Hannah. "I've never touched any other woman except you.Never once!"

Those nearby whispered, "Is this a public clarification?"

In an instant, louder gasps and chatter swept through the onlookers. Every gaze shifted back and forth between Vincent and Hannah.

Hannah gave Vincent no reply, ignoring the probing stares around her. Instead, she fixed her attention on the van pulling closer. "Let's go. The van is here."

Without hesitation, she turned and strode toward the van without a backward glance.

Vincent's eyes followed Hannah's leaving silhouette, his look unreadable. He moved quickly, pulled the door open, and sat beside Hannah inside.

The vehicle rolled forward slowly, leaving the scene behind.

Within the van, silence pressed heavily.

Hannah leaned against her seat, eyelids closed. Vincent stayed wordless for a few moments before turning his gaze to her resting face. He spoke sincerely."What I said earlier is true. You've always been my only woman. Always!"

Hannah's lashes flickered slightly, though her eyes remained shut. She angled her head faintly toward the window.

Vincent's look darkened but soon steadied itself again. He dropped it, thinking she might be exhausted.

******

The van halted at the gate of Sterling Heights.

Hannah pushed the door open and hurried toward her bouilding, not sparing a glance back.

Vincent stepped out as well, trailing at a careful distance behind her.

Hannah slowed for a moment, though she never turned, only quickened her steps. Vincent probably intended to escort her home safely.

Though irritated, Hannah lacked the strength to argue with him now.

They walked ahead in silence.

Hannah stepped into the elevator, and Vincent naturally entered with her.

As the elevator ascended, an uncomfortable quiet filled the small space.

When they reached the twenty-second floor, Hannah exited swiftly, heading for her apartment door.

Vincent remained a single step behind, quietly observing.

Hannah finally faced him. Her tone was composed and distant, edged with deliberate dismissal. "I'm home now.You should return. Thanks for sending me back. Goodbye."

Vincent did not depart at once. He leaned in slightly and then asked, "What would you like to eat tomorrow?I'll bring it for you."

Hannah's brows drew together immediately. Again! The same condescending concern! Did he think this could make up for the past, as if nothing had happened?

She lifted her head, reminding him coolly. "Did you forget? I reported your car to property management.Your car isn't allowed in, so save yourself the trouble."

Vincent's mouth curved into a faint smile. His gaze held hers calmly. "I know. That's why I purchased a unit in this complex. My apartment sits just below yours."

Vincent paused briefly, his voice carrying subtle insistence. "So, the property management can't keep me out."
###Chapter 432 Emotional Outburst


Hannah froze in disbelief. She never imagined Vincent would purchase the apartment just beneath hers. She suppressed the tumnultuous shock and fury she felt, lifted her chin, and locked onto Vincent's dark gaze."Mr. Jones, that really is a massive purchase."

Vincent regarded Hannah in silence, offering no reply to the evident mockery. He merely inclined forward a little, speaking softly. "I'll drive you to the office tomorrow."

The words struck like a tinder match, instantly awakening emotions Hannah had pressed down for so long.She studied Vincent, who always carried the aura of being in command of everything, and a heavy weariness mingled with frustration swept through her.

Hannah kept quiet for several moments and then slowly expressed the truest feelings buried inside, one phrase at a time. "First, I'm grateful for your assistance today. Without you, my vehicle wouldn't have halted so safely. I will always remember the favor."

Hannah halted, her stare sharp as it met Vincent's, adding, "Since we're now neighbors, I'd prefer you keep out of my private sphere and avoid constant intrusion."

Vincent's brow knit ever so slightly. "I'm not attempting to intrude on your life."

"But you are!" Hannah's tone suddenly climbed, charged with repressed fury and a cutting force.′′Vincent!You appear before me daily. Forget the breakfasts or the packed meals-now you've even bought the apartment under mine! Isn't that intrusion? Isn't this your way of observing me?"

She noticed the faint shift across Vincent's features, feeling no victory, only deeper fatigue and harder determination. "If you don't want me to move away immediately, get out of this compound. Abandon this city altogether. And I beg you, beginning tomorrow, stop drowning me in attention. I don't want it, not in the slightest!"
Hannah's gaze turned frosty and detached. "This apartment was the final place my father lived before his passing.You must know what that means to me. So, don't come looking for me tomorrow. Or ever again. I'd

Having said her piece, Hannah denied Vincent the chance to reply, swiftly turning and entering her apartment, shutting the door hard.

Outside the door, Vincent stayed rooted in place. This was the longest speech that he had heard from Hannah since they met again. She'd voiced gratitude for his aid but firmly marked her line. She'd even threatened to move away altogether. She didn't need him.

Vincent lingered there along while. At last, he slowly pivoted. His stride grew heavy as he made his way toward the elevator.

******

The following morning, Hannah rose as usual and got ready to eat. As she opened the refrigerator, a sudden knock echoed at her door.

Hannah's movement stopped cold, irritation flooding up inside. Was that Vincent again? She'd spelled everything out yesterday, yet why was he still here?

Hannah stormed to the door and flung it wide, shouting, "I told you not to bother me! I don't..."

Her voice broke off at once. It wasn't Vincent at the door, but a middle-aged womanin a chef's cap.

"Good morning, Ms. Scott!" the woman greeted cheerfully, her voice bright and deferential as she waved the food container in her hand. "You may call me Addie! I've brought breakfast for you!"

As Addie spoke, she lifted an insulated carrier from the floor."And here's your lunch. Mr. Jones personally instructed me to prepare meals for you from today onward! I'll see that they're wholesome and tasty!"

Hannah blinked in shock. Vincent actually employed a cook for her? Her face hardened, and she answered icily, "I don't want it. Take it back."
。
Addie edged the food container and insulated carrier forward again, unease flickering in her eyes.′′Ms.Scott,please accept it. If you refuse, Mr. Jones will dock my pay! I've just gone through a divorce, and I have children depending on me. This work matters enormously to me." Hannah's brows pressed tighty together. She glanced at the food container and insulated carrier, and then at Addie's pleading look that seemed to say, "I'll be doomed if you refuse."

Hannah wavered briefly. In the end, she relented and said, "Fine." She extended her hands and accepted the heavy food container and insulated carrier.

Addie's face brightened with relief. "Excellent! Thank you, Ms. Scott. You're truly generous! Don't trouble yourself with washing the container and insulated carrier. I'll come to collect them when I bring you dinner!You likely have business awaiting. I'll take my leave now."

Addie gave a polite bow, then turned and departed briskly, steps light.

Hannah shut the door and placed the container and insulated carrier on the dining table. Lifting the cover,she discovered a lavish breakfast, full of flavors she had once loved.

Meanwhile, inside the Jones Group conference hall, a project manager stood before the screen, presenting his plan with fervor.

Vincent,head bent, received a note from the chef, Addie. "Mr. Jones, Ms. Scott accepted both breakfast and lunch."

Vincent's lips curved faintly into a smile he couldn't suppress.
###Chapter 433 Unease


This marked the very first instance that Vincent had stored a chef's number in his private phone.

Last night, after Hannah had turned him down so firmly, Vincent had altered his plan and specifically hired a chef tasked with preparing Hannah's meals every single day.

His concern over Hannah's nutrition arose because she appeared to have lost a considerable amount of weight. He became especially aware of it the moment he grasped her wrist that day; it felt alarmingly delicate.

Right then, the project manager, Huntley Perry, was presenting until his throat turned dry, darting a glance at Vincent, seated at the top of the conference table.

Unexpectedly, Vincent, who usually radiated severity, now showed a faint curve at his lips.

Huntley felt a thrill of elation. Was Vincent actually smiling while he gave his presentation? His proposal must have captured Vincent's approval!

Brimming with confidence, Huntley raised his tone with greater force. "Thus, I firmly propose we launch this project without delay, allocate resources, and secure the market lead!"

Huntley finished his speech with a bold flourish and fixed his gaze on Vincent expectantly.

The atmosphere turned hushed. Every gaze locked onto Vincent.

Vincent gradually lifted his face. The hint of a smile had dissolved entirely, replaced with his typical cold sharpness.

"Are you done?" Vincent's tone was low and stripped of warmth.



Vincent leaned slightly backward, pressing into the broad leather chair, his fingertips rhythmically tapping the table, each crisp sound cutting through the stillness. That faint rhythm carried an invisible weight across the quiet space.

Vincent let out a mocking chuckle, declaring, "You used last year's data in your proposal, didn't you? The market has fundamentally changed this year. Rival products have already secured the first-mover advantage. Your statistics are stale, and your analysis is narrow. Is this how you handle your responsibilities?Is this what your department has to offer?"

Huntley's grin collapsed instantly, his complexion draining. "We'll revise it immediately."

Huntley chastened himself inwardly. So Vincent didn't smile because he was satisfied with the proposal.What a disastrous misread!

******

Hannah eventually brought the insulated carrier prepared by the chef to work.

For precaution, she took a taxi rather than driving herself to Luminara Group. Once she reached the company, she slid the insulated carrier beneath her desk.

All morning, a faint unease lingered in her chest.

At lunchtime, she went straight toward the group's security division. Relying on Victoria's highest clearance,she dismissed the security team.

She slipped into the main monitoring chamber and retrieved every camera feed surrounding her parking spot from the day before.

Holding her breath, Hannah focused intently on the screen.

As the footage rewound minute by minute, an irregularity appeared roughly an hour after she had arrived at the company yesterday.

A figure wrapped in heavy clothing crept toward her white vehicle furtively. The bulky figure tampered beneath the car for about sixty seconds before darting away into a blind corner outside the lens.

Hannah immediately copied the video footage. When she returned to her office, she messaged Vincent."Send me every photo I snapped yesterday.I need them all." Vincent replied without delay, and the images arrived quickly. He then followed up, asking, "Did you identify the suspect?"

Hannah answered, "Not yet."

Vincentinquired, "Does the food suit you?"

Hannah had intended to reply with "50-50",but remembering Addie, she altered her words. "Addie's cooking is wonderful. Don't dock her pay."

Vincent instantly replied, "Alright."

Hannah ended the conversation there.

She swiftly packaged the footage and photographs, forwarding them to Officer Gavin, who once managed her case, with a brief note of explanation. Gavin assured her he would monitor it closely.
Only after completing all this did Hannah feel some measure of calm. She uncovered the insulated carrier,steam rising with a rich aroma, though her appetite remained low, and she only tasted a few mouthfuls.

As the afternoon resumed, Hannah's office line rang. It was Calvin's assistant. "Ms. Preston, please proceed to Room 3 at once. Mr. Briggs and several directors are requesting you now."

A faint tightness seized Hannah's chest. She had the sense that something significant was about to unfold.

Gathering her composure, Hannah rose and walked toward Room 3.

On one side of the long table sat Calvin,Finance Director Michael Clark,Audit Director Collin Leo,along with two additional directors Hannah did not know personally but recognized as holding senior authority.

Hannah had braced for the possibility of her identity being exposed, but upon entering,she realized her concerns had been misplaced. None of them was familiar. It appeared major shifts in personnel had occurred during her time away from the group.

Every gaze fastened upon Hannah, laced with scrutiny and veiled animosity.

Michael snatched a stack of papers from the table and slammed them down forcefully in front of her The papers spread apart, exposing the "revised" document for the Stellink Plan data that Calvin had handed over the day before.

Michael's tone rose harshly, brimming with undisguised fury and condemnation. "Natalie, explain this.Is this the conduct of a supervisor? How could you falsify figures on such a vital project? The nerve!"
###Chapter 434 A Trap


Hannah's heart lurched. Someone had caught onto the tampered data already?

Hannah stole a glance at Calvin. His head remained bowed, his silence betraying no hint of defense or shared accountability.

Yet, what struck her as odd was that Calvin showed not a hint of panic. If their doings had been exposed,how could the mastermind, Calvin, remain so unruffled?

Steadying herself, Hannah met Michael's piercing gaze with calm resolve. "Mr. Clark, I'm not sure what you're implying. I processed this document according to standard data procedures and guidelines.I didn't tamper with anything."

"No tampering?" Collin sneered, snatching up another document. "Take a look at this! The Finance Department just verified your bank statement. Your personal account received thirty thousand dollars yesterday afternoon, from an unknown source-right after you submitted this 'optimized' document! Natalie,how can you deny it? Isn't this solid evidence of your kickbacks?"

"Speak!" Michael slammed his fist on the table. "This is a major deal. A mere supervisorlike you couldn't pull it off alone. Who's behind it? Do you have accomplices?"

The weight of their accusations pressed down on Hannah. Every eye in the room locked onto her.

Should she betray Calvin? The thought crossed her mind briefly but was snuffed out just as quickly. The timing wasn't right-not at all. This felt like a carefully laid trap.

"Ms. Preston," Michael said, "provide the names of your accomplices, and we'll consider offsetting your mistakes and chalking it up to being misled. You're young. Your future matters."

Hannah refused to waver. She shifted the focus. "The thirty thousand dollars came from my side job. It has nothing to do with the company project."

Richard scoffed, tapping the′′problematic document" on the table with force. "Fine, let's say the money's from your side job. But what about this document? Are you claiming you didn't manipulate the data? Several key figures here don't add up!"

Michael leaned forward, his voice low and pointed. "Natalie, let's be blunt. Was it Calvin? Did he orderyou to falsify the data? Be honest. Confess, and we'll report him immediately. And..." He paused, dangling a tempting offer. "We'll promote you to manager. You'd take his place."

Calvin, silent until now, finally lifted his head, his eyes searching Natalie's face.

"NO,"Hannah said. "Mr. Briggs gave me no such instructions."

Michael's face twisted with exaggerated disappointment and fury. "You're being foolish, Natalie! Protecting him? Will he protect you? Look at him-he hasn't said a word in your defense. Is he worth it?"

Other directors joined in.

"Exactly, Ms. Preston! What's the point of staying silent? Speak now, and you can still salvage this."

"If we confirm it later, getting fired will be the least of your problems. You could face legal consequences.By then, you'll have no one to turn to!"

Hannah paused for a moment and then spoke with measured calm. "I didn't temper with the data. Mr. Briggs did not instruct me either."

Michael stared at her for a long beat and then waved her off with a dismissive flick of his hand. "Fine. You're done here. We'll notify you of your punishment later."

Wordlessly, Hannah turned and left the office.

The meeting room door closed behind her, sealing off the tension within.

The oppressive atmosphere in the room dissolved instantly.

Michael's scowl gave way to an amused smirk. He picked up his cup, sipping leisuely as he glanced at Calvin. "Calvin, this one's a cut above that fool Leonard. She's poised and unshaken. Even under that kind of pressure, she didn't turn on you. Quite impressive." Collin leaned back in his chair, a grin spreading across his face. "Her composure is remarkable. Mr. Clark's final offer of a managerial promotion would have swayed most people. Yet, she stood firm, insisting it wasn't Calvin's doing. That's an impressive level of composure!"

Their conversation rolled on.

Meanwhile, Hannah returned to the security center. She stood before the conference room's surveillance monitor, her gaze sharp. So, this really was a trap set by them.
###Chapter 435 Passing The Test


Hannah stood transfixed before the surveillance screen. She was more shocked than ever by the revelation that so many people in Luminara Group's top echelon were in cahoots with Calvin. They abused their positions, siphoned company funds, and rigged projects, weaving together an intricate network of corruption.

Rage and disbelief crashed over her in waves. She could barely contain herself, desperate to storm over and expose their dirty dealings to the world!

Yet, reason quickly reasserted itself. She couldn't act impulsively. These people had deep roots throughout the company; any rash action would only alert them.

Within the conference room, the group's plotting continued unabated.

Michael gave Calvin his orders. "Next, we observe whether Natalie lets anything slip in front of Adrian, and gauge his reaction to her. Bring this file with the fabricated data to Adrian. Let's see if he'l shield her. The moment Adrian shows even a hint of favoritism, or if she breathes so much as a word to him..." Hepaused,eyes glinting with cold malice. "Natalie cannot be kept anymore!"

Calvin bobbed his head eagerly, practically glowing with servile enthusiasm. "Absolutely! I'll take care of it immediately!"

Michael then addressed one of his technical allies, voice dropping to an icy whisper, "Ensure the surveillance footage is completely wiped."

"Consider it done!" came the swift reply, accompanied by a conspiratorial gleam.

"Very well, meeting adjourned. Return to your duties." Michael dismissed them with a casual wave, as though they'd merely discussed lunch plans.

Hannah's fingers flew across the control console. Using Victoria's top-level clearance, she copied Meeting Room 3's complete footage into an encrypted cloud storage that only she could access. Once finished,she slipped away from the surveillance area without attracting the slightest attention.

Back in her office, she secured the door. She briefed Adrian swiftly on the day's revelations, stressing that he must cooperate with her plan and maintain complete neutrality, showing her no special treatment whatsoever.

Adrian's agreement did little to ease Hannah's troubled expression. Luminara Group truly stood at a crossroads.

As anticipated, Hannah received a summons to Adrian's office shortly after. Both Michael and Calvin awaited her there.

The "damning evidence" lay spread across Adrian's desk.

Adrian confronted Hannah with harsh accusations about the data falsification, his tone cutting like a blade as he announced her immediate termination.

Hannah maintained her silence. She offered no defense and made no desperate pleas.

Her quiet defiance appeared obstinate and remorseless in the face of Adrian's wrath.

Just as Adrian prepared to deliver the final blow, Michael intervened with perfect timing. He first validated Adrian's righteous anger and unwavering principles and then smoothly shifted to advocate for Natalie."Fortunately, we caught this before any real damage occurred. Termination seems rather harsh. Perhaps docking three months' salary with a month of probation would suffice? Should anything like this happen again, immediate dismissal follows without question. What are your thoughts, Mr. Miller?"

Adrian considered Michael's proposal and eventually relented with a heavy sigh. "Very well, we'll go with that."

Hannah accepted the punishment without argument or gratitude, offering only a slight bow before turning toward the door.

As she stepped into.the hallway, Calvin materialized beside her, brushing past while murmuring quickly,"Well done. You passed the test." Hannah's stride faltered, her face cycling through a canvas of shock, bewilderment, and dawning terror, as though the true scope of her situation had just crystallized.

Calvin, pleased with her "stunned" reaction, flashed a meaningful smile and continued down the hall.

Once Calvin's figure vanished around the corner, Hannah's expression hardened to ice. They still believed they held all the cards. Soon, it would be time to sweep them all up in one decisive move.

Her phone buzzed with a message from Gavin."Ms. Scott, do you recognize this man? He confessed to sabotaging your brake system."

A photo accompanied the text.

Hannah's brow creased in confusion.Why was it him?
###Chapter 436 A Minor Burn


Hannah received the message just as her workday wrapped up. With hurried steps, she made her way straight to the police station.

Inside the interrogation room, Leonard sat handcuffed in the chair.

The moment she stepped through the door, Leonard lurched forward, only to be yanked back by the handcuffs. His face twisted with rage as he bellowed, "Natalie, how did you even survive a car with failed brakes? This is unfair!"

Hannah moved to stand in front of him, her eyes cold and unflinching. "Was it you who tried to kill me,or did someone else order you to do the dirty work?"

Her sharp presence made Leonard instinctively recoil, though he quickly jutted his chin up. Panic flickered in his eyes as he shouted, "O-Of course, it was only me! Who else was involved? You messed with my life!Because of you, I lost my job, and my wife threatens divorce every single day! I hate you-l wish you were fucking dead already!"

Hannah let him rant, her silence pressing down heavier than his words. When he finally ran out of breath,she spoke slowly, every word deliberate. "You strutted around work acting invincible, and you never once bothered to learn if I even owned a car. So tell me-how could you possibly know which car I was driving after you were fired? And I have more thanone car. How did you know which one I took that day or where it was parked?"

Letting out a low,cunning laugh,Leonard retorted,"Trail you a few times and I figure out everything.I've had my eye on you for a long while."

Hannah arched a brow, her lips curling into a razor-edged smile. "Stalking me, huh? Well, congratulations-you just added another charge. Illegal surveillance and attempted murder.®With that record, you'll rot in prison for the rest of your pathetic life."

"You set me up!" Leonard's face twisted as he caught his mistake. Rage kindledin his eyes, sharp and burning. Snatching up the steaming enamel coffee mug, he hurled it at her with a roar. "You damn bitch! Go straight to hell!"

Hannah jerked back instinctively, but before the cup struck, a figure burst through the doorway and threw himself in front of her.

A hiss of liquid followed by a sharp splash-the scalding coffee splattered across Vincent's back.

Gavin moved in quickly to restrain Leonard and then straightened, concern sharp in his voice. "That coffee was boiling! Mr. Jones, any burns?"

Still rattled, Hannah turned wide eyes toward Vincent. "Why are you here?"

Vincent held her gaze,voice low and scoffed.′′Are you hurt?"

Their words overlapped, tumbling out almost together.

Hannah gave a faint shake of her head.

Vincent had been monitoring the case closely ever since he learned she filed the report. The moment Gavin's message reached him, he dropped everything and rushed over.

Gavin stepped forward, his tone brisk. "Mr. Jones, Ms. Scott, there's nothing else to handle here. You'd better go now. That burn isn't minor-it needs immediate treatment."

Vincent nodded slightly, saying no more.

Having signed off on her statement, Hannah walked out of the police station with him at her side.

Vincent's car waited quietly at the curb outside the station, the glossy black vehicle catching faint reflections from the streetlights.

Derek stepped forward quickly, opening the rear door with practiced respect. "Ms. Scott, it's been a while,"he greeted warmly.

Hannah gave him a polite nod before turning toward Vincent. "You should let Derek drive you straight to the hospital." Vincent ignored her suggestion, his eyes fixed on her instead. "You didn't bring your car, did you? I'll take you home first."

His hand reached out naturally, fingers brushing her wrist.

She instinctively tried to slip away, her wrist twisting just slightly-when a sharp breath escaped him, his brow knitting in pain.

Hannah's movements stilled. "It's that serious?" Her voice carried the concern she did not realize was there.

"Just a little," he murmured, though his gaze lingered on her. "Get in the car."

Faced with his unyielding insistence, Hannah finally gave in and slipped into the back seat without a word.

Vincent slid in beside her while Derek eased the car smoothly toward Sterling Heights.

When they arrived and the car rolled to a stop, Hannah pushed the door open and stepped out,Vincent following close behind.

"Shouldn't you be heading to the hospital?" Hannah asked, her brow furrowed.

"It's nothing more than a minor burn," Vincent replied evenly, as if the man who had winced so sharply outside the police station had been someone else.

Hannah's gaze lingered on him in silence. A minor burn? Then why the wince was so loud earlier? She chose not to challenge him further and headed home without another word.

Vincent trailed after her, the two stepping into the elevator one after the other.

Inside the confined space, the air grew still, the closeness between them carrying an unspoken tension.

The elevator doors slid open on the twenty-second floor, and Hannah made her way down the quiet corridor toward her apartment. Vincent lingered a step behind, his presence shadowing her.

She unlocked her door and then glanced back at him with a cool reminder.RJOur place is one floor down."The message was clear-he could leave now.

Vincent gave a short nod as if he were about to turn away. Then, as though something suddenly came to
mind, he pivoted back, his expression troubled. "I just realized my water's out. Mind if I borrow your shower?"

Her refusal came without hesitation. "That's not possible."

He frowned, his voice carrying a trace of grievance. "But I got myself burned and my clothes wet only because of you."

"That's not my fault," she countered, irritation flickering in her eyes. "I never asked you to throw yourself in front of me. I could've dodged on my own-you were just being overbearing."

With that, she moved to shut the door, her hand pressing the edge to swing it closed.

Vincent reached out instinctively. The heavy door clipped across his fingers with a sharp thud.

A stifled groan escaped him, his face tightening as his knuckles reddened and swelled against the frame.
###Chapter 437 Who Does This T-shirt Belong To


Hannah's posture stiffened slightly. No words left her lips at first, but after a brief pause, she stepped aside to allow Vincent entry.

Vincent walked into her apartment. Upon entering, his eyes roamed the room's arrangement-it was neat and unembellished. The furnishings carried an unmistakable elegance, just like they had been before.

"Please respect my privacy," Hannah replied, her voice edged with firmness as she grabbed a compact emergency kit from the shelf.

Vincent withdrew his gaze, his tone hushed. "Feels cozy in here."

Hannah paused slightly, her voice flat. "My parents arranged everything. I haven't changed a thing."

Approaching him, she gestured toward a seat. With practiced ease, she unpacked the kit and began tending to the swollen marks on his fingers using swabs and antiseptic.

Vincent studied her, noting how her gaze stayed fixed downward. Moments passed in quiet before he suddenly inquired, "How's your mother doing? Is she making progress after the traumatic cranial incident?"

Hannah's head jerked up. "Where did you learn those details about her health?"

Vincent stared back, his expression steady and resolute. "Before you relocated her, I commissioned a foreign specialist group in brain surgery to devise custom care and recovery protocols."

Hannah's eyes narrowed, a jolt of pressure tightening in her chest. No wonder back in Cavendria, the doctors responsible for her mother's rehabilitation had always said, "The initial treatment was timely and thorough, " "The foundation is solid, " and "She has great potential for recovery." It turned out that he hadn't imprisoned her mother but had arranged for the treatment. Could she have been mistaken all this time?

A swell of astonishment and conflicting emotions surged through her. She faced Vincent again, her lips parting but unable to form a reply. What was there to say? That Chapter had long closed.Hannah sped up her pace, disinfecting, applying medicine, and bandaging his wounds with a seamless flow of motion.

Once finished, she swiftly packed up the first aid kit. Her voice regained its detached chill. "That's it. You may leave now."

Vincent lifted his gaze and stated plainly, "I haven't showered yet."

Hannah's brows pinched together. "You have to shower today?"

"Absolutely," Vincent affirmed. "After all, I got messed up because of you. Who's heading in first, you or me?"

Rendered momentarily mute by his refusal to budge, Hannah finally gave in, her voice clipped and tight."Fine, rinse off quickly! And don't linger once you're done!"

Vincent looked rather pleased by her surrender, chuckling under his breath as he disappeared into the bathroom.

Hannah sank into the sofa, her nerves prickling with unrest as the sound of rushing water filled the air.

Time dragged on until, an hour later, the bathroom door creaked open.

She rolled her eyes and muttered, "Mr. Jones, you sure take your time."

Only then did she glance up-only to find him standing at the threshold with nothing but a towel loosely tied around his hips, his chest exposed to the open air.

Hannah's head snapped away. Her tone was laced with exasperation and embarrassment."Why aren't you wearing anything?"

A mischievous gleam flickered in Vincent's eyes. He shrugged. "Didn't bring anything to change into. This is all I've got."

Trying to hold onto composure, Hannah asked, "Are you planning to go back like that?"

Vincent shook his head like it was self-evident. "Not happening. I'll just crash here tonight. Derek can drop clothes off tomorrow morning."

"In your dreams!" Hannah shot back immediately.

She stormed off into one of the rooms and began rummaging with haste. Soon, she returned, tossing him a plain white T-shirt. "Put this on and get out!"

Vincent caught it easily, his fingertips grazing the soft fabric. The shirt wasn't something an older man would wear-it looked youthful in cut and fit. He raised his eyes, probing. "Claude's?"

"No!" It belonged to her-she liked baggy shirts for sleepwear.

Vincent studied herexpression, his tone dipping lower. "Then who doesit belong to?"

Irritated by his persistence, a surge of defiance welled up within Hannah. She raised her chin, her eyes challenging and aloof. "Just some guy I hooked up with."

Vincent's face darkened instantly, and he flung the shirt aside. Before Hannah could react, his uninjured hand locked around her wrist.

His height closed in on her, right arm pressed behind the couch, boxing her between his chest and the backrest. His breath landed fast and hot against her cheek. "You'd rather entertain flings than give me a chance?"
###Chapter 438 Then Check My Kissing Skills
Hannah jerked back, slipping deftly out of Vincent's grasp. She retreated two quick steps, putting a gulf of air between them, her chest rising and falling like ripples on restless water. "I'm not interested in sleeping with my ex-husband!"

Vincent's lips curved, the smile edged with danger."How can you be so certain when you never give it a try?"

Again, he moved closer, his tall frame pressing down with unspoken weight, eyes fixed stubbornly on her lips.

As he advanced, a spark of defiance lit in Hannah's heart. Rather than shrinking back, she lifted her chin,her gaze teasing, daring. "I prefer younger men-the ones with silver tongues and sweet words. Before Vincent could counter, she spun, plucked a neatly bound booklet from the shelf, and tossed it at him. "Have a look." She pointed. "My list of first-rate flings! Youthful, lively, and far more entertaining than you."

In truth, it was nothing more than Adrian's list of candidates for game brand ambassadors.

Vincent glanced at it, his face unreadable. She actually kept a list of her hookups? Jealousy stabbed him like a thorn. Without pause, he seized her wrist and tugged her sharply toward him.

Off balance, Hannah tumbled onto his lap.

Vincent's other hand clasped the back of her neck,and in one fierce motion, he captured her lips, prying them open with sheer will.

"Mmm..." Hannah pressed against his solid chest,twisting her head, desperate to escape the searing heat of his kiss.

But Vincent was relentless, holding her firmly as if" the world itself might slip away.

At last, he loosened slightly, their lips parting for breath, his voice ragged. "Your reaction... It doesn't look like someone accustomed to flings."

Hannah's chest heaved as she shoved at him. "I don't kiss my hookup partners!"

"Is that so?" His gaze darkened, grip tightening as he drew her closer. "Then check my kissing skills. See if you're satisfied."

Before she could argue, he lowered his head once more, sealing her lips. This time, the kss burned less like fire and more like slow, molten honey-lingering,deep.

Hannah struggled fiercely, yet under his storm of passion, her strength ebbed away.

The heat between them rose like a tide. Lips and tongues tangled, bodies locked with scarcely a breath of space left.

Vincent's hand roamed over her slender waist, unrestrained.

Just as they teetered on the edge of losing control, a sharp knock at the door shattered the spell.

Hannah jolted back, shoving him away.

Caught off guard, Vincent toppled onto the sofa.

Hannah straightened her collar in haste and strode to the door. "Who's there?"

Outside, Addie's bright voice rang out."Ms. Scott!It's me,Addie-bringing your dinner!"

Hannah drew a long breath before opening the door.

By then, Vincent had already slipped into the bathroom, frustration etched across his face.

Addie set the tray neatly on the table, picked up the earlier lunchbox with practiced hands, and left.

Hannah immediately picked up her fork and knife,eating without hesitation.

Vincent emerged only after the door had closed. He  walked over, brows knitted. "You still have an appetite?"

Hannah's tone was calm, steady as stone. "Why wouldn'tl?"

Vincent stared, Adam's apple bobbing, his voice low,rough, strained. "I'm completely turned on."

Her eyes stayed cool. "Shall I call someone to help you? One woman, or two?"

Vincent's face darkened, humiliation and fury flashing in his eyes. Without another word, he stormed back into the bathroom.

The crash of water soon followed, echoing with his frustration, the bandage on his hand washing away in the torrent.

Hannah's lips curved into a faint smile.

By the time Vincent reappeared, she had finished her meal and sat calmly on the sofa, working on her laptop. He pulled on a T-shirt, silent for a beat, and then spoke at last. "There's something I must tell you.Something I've just confirmed."
###Chapter 439 Dishonorable


Hannah's hands froze briefly above the keyboard.Without lifting her head, her tone was even and composed."What is it?"

Vincent slipped into the T-shirt, then pulled out his phone, unlocked the screen, and played a clip,holding it out to her. "That imposter wearing a face almost identical to yours had dealings with Leonard.Just a few days before your brakes were tampered with."

Hannah eventually shifted her focus from her laptop screen and turned her attention to Vincent's phone.

The video wasn't entirely clear, yet it was recognizablè as footage from a shop in the mall. A figure bearing a startling resemblance to her was engaged in a furious quarrel with Leonard.

The woman looked visibly upset, her finger nearly stabbing the air in front of Leonard's face as though leveling blame.

Leonard looked both furious and wounded,attempting to argue his innocence.

In the end, the store manager stepped in and dismissed Leonard.

"It's obvious she's using Leonard to carry out her schemes!" Vincent's tone was sharp and logical."She deliberately ignited Leonard's resentment,manipulating his animosity toward you to strike from the shadows."

Hannah inhaled slowly, suppressing the surge of dread and fury stirring inside her. Her tone carried restrained tension. "Have you uncovered her identity yet?"

Vincent pulled his phone back, his gaze intent. "She registered the name 'Hannah Scott' to undergQ plastic surgery abroad. My team is still pursuing her actual background and travel documents, but she was meticulous and erased much of her trail." Hannah lingered in silence for several beats. Her focus returned to the laptop, her fingers absently brushing the touchpad. Her tone remained level. "I heard you allowed her to live inside the Jones family estate?"

She had earlier employed someone to look into it and had viewed the pictures herself. The likeness was disturbingly precise.

Vincent's eyes flickered faintly. "You seem quite invested in what I do."

Hannah raised her head and matched his stare directly. Her expression was steady and candid, free of avoidance. "You're mistaken. My concern is with myself. Since someone is moving around with my face, stirring chaos, I need to know her movements."

She broke off, her tone flattening into indifference."Now that you're finished cleaning up, please leave quickly. I, as a lowly employee, still need to grind through overtime."

Vincent's eyes slid across the crowded emails and
Clean AlI Janitorial documents crowding her laptop screen, his brow tightening slightly. "At this hour, you're still at work?"

Hannah curved her lips in a wry smile. "As an employee, if I don't finish my work, am I waiting to get the boot?"

Vincent studied her in quiet for a few moments before speaking suddenly. "My earlier suggestion of helping you get promoted was genuine."

He referred to his earlier pledge to supply her with projects and assist in her promotion.

Hannah's hands hesitated once more over the keyboard,listening without interruption.

"I can support you in climbing higher within Luminara Group," he stated firmly, "and even help you reclaim ·the company."

Hannah locked eyes with him. "Mr. Jones, what you propose is alluring. Yet, where do you place Victoria,the president and chairwoman of the company? Do you believe she will surrender Luminara Group so
 easily?"

Vincent's stare remained unwavering, his gaze calm yet intent. "I'm not dismissing Victoria's abilities. Still,even without me stepping in, Luminara Group is already in decline, don't you think?"

His words carried a cutting certainty. "Corruption runs rampant, bribes are widespread, and few are truly working. The core has already been gutted."

Hannah's pulse stuttered. His blunt assessment struck painfully close to reality. She leaned nearer,her stare edged with menace. "Oh? If I truly desire Luminara Group, how would you enable me to seize it?"

"Straightforward." His reply was deep, as though stating inevitability. "Circulate talk about collapsing finances, devastating losses in major projects, and systemic misconduct at the top. None of it must be entirely factual, only convincing. Fear spreads, and once investors panic, the value will collapse. The shareholders holding equity, desperate to escape,will unload their stock. At that moment, I can help you acquire massive amounts at rock-bottom prices."

He stopped briefly, his eyes anchoring firmly on her."As long as your stake outweighs Victoria's, or if you ally with those discontented, you can depose her during the shareholders' assembly. And then, you'll ascend without resistance."

Hannah remained quiet, her face unreadable. Only after Vincent finished did she speak, slowly shaping a single word. "Dishonorable."

Vincent showed no irritation; instead, a faint laugh escaped him. "The tactics may be dishonorable, but they're effective."

He fixed his eyes on her. "The business world is a battlefield. At times, victory requires casting aside scruples."

Hannah's gaze rested on him for several moments,her eyes churning with mixed emotions. At last, she rose abruptly, her movements edged with restrained vexation, and pushed Vincent toward the exit with her palm against his shoulder. "Enough, Mr. Jones! I want no part of your elaborate schemes! Get out; l need to work!"

Vincent was forced beyond the doorway. The heavy door slammed shut in his face without hesitation.

His brows furrowed darkly. Weren't they speaking cordially only moments ago? Why had she suddenly turned hostile?
###Chapter 440 A Big Deal


Inside the Jones family manor, Erica lingered near Sharon, tuning in to her ongoing call with Vincent.

After the call ended, Sharon turned toward Erica,her expression flat. "Hannah, Vincent won't be returning home to sleep tonight."

Erica's hands coiled into fists, her pale knuckles giving her away. Vincent had once again chosen to stay away. Since she had moved into the manor under the guise of "Hannah", Vincent hadn't spent a night here anymore. Was work really keeping him that busy, or was it just an excuse? And Hannah-she had actually survived? Leonard was entirely ineffective. All her efforts to provoke him using Hannah's face had been in vain.

She figured that working at Jones Group was her only chance to get close to Vincent.

Suddenly, Sharon's voice broke her rumination. "Is
something bothering you? You appear really worn out. Didn't sleep well?"

Erica blinked back into focus, lowering her eyes, her tone unsteady. "Sharon, I'mn alright. I was just reflecting on my job prospects. I mentioned to Vincent that I'd like a role at Jones Group, but he hasn't agreed yet. Sharon, could you help me?"

Sharon sighed, "Maybe he's overwhelmed with work and forgot. I'll help you with that. Which department are you hoping to join?"

Joy flickered across Erica's face as she calculated quietly. The secretary department would place her near Vincent, but that would look too planned. After a careful pause, she responded, "Sharon, I've done some drawing and studied design. Would it be acceptable for me to try the design team at the Jones Group? I don't mind starting as an assistant."

Sharon gave her shoulder a firm pat. "Of course! I'N handle it! It's too late now, and I'll call the department head tomorrow morning. You can go straight to report!"
"Really?" Erica's expression bloomed as she clutched Sharon's hand, "Thank you, Sharon! You're the best!"

Sharon returned a warm smile. "Feeling better now?"

"Yes!" Erica nodded repeatedly.



水水水水水＊

A few days later, a meeting over the NeuroCore Initiative procurement was held inside the Luminara Group.

Hannah was in attendance. She was seated at the far side of the long table. While not in a leading spot,her inclusion meant she was clearly seen as part of the team.

Her eyes drifted casually across the room; every person was from the earlier gathering in Room 3. She smirked silently: this wasn't a real corporate purchase briefing-it looked more like a covert scheme to divide benefits.

Once the meeting commenced, Calvin, who led the
project-spoke as if introducing actual "NeuroCore Initiative" needs-acquiring a batch of state-of-the-art tools for next-gen chip production.

However, ProTech Materials Depot's proposal was outrageously priced-totaling $120 million.

Due to financial constraints, Victoria had firmly demanded a 15% cut, reducing it to $102 million.

ProTech Materials Depot stood its ground, refusing to comply.

Thus, Calvin proposed an alternative plan-source it from Lightwheel Technology, whose specs were comparable. By buying from Lightwheel Technology,they could slice the cost by 30%. And the attendees of this meeting could then take the 15% difference as their share.

Calvin abruptly glanced toward Natalie and asked "Ms. Preston, do you understand the implication?"

Hannah, locking eyes with him, answered with ambition "It means we can qain $26 million in

margin."

"Clever!" Calvin replied, clearly pleased.

Michael chuckled, gesturing toward her. "Ms.Preston! You're in luck, encountering such a big deal right after joining us! This is an unprecedented one!"

Hannah glanced at him like she was surprised."What's my cut?"

A burst of laughter erupted from some, and others snickered or sneered, mocking her for being overreaching or greedy.

Michael laughed even louder."I enjoy your bluntness!Ms. Preston, relax-if this works out, at least this amount is yours." He held up two fingers.

"Two hundred thousand?" Hannah "guessed" aloud.

"Ha! Dream bigger! Tack on another zero. That's two million dollars!" Michael beamed.

Hannah instantly widened her eyes as if in total disbelief. "That's amazing! Thank you, Mr. Clark!"
Calvin, clearly enjoying her reaction, rapped his knuckles on the desk. "Alright, back to business. Ms.Preston, we've secured the pipelines. Lightwheel Technology is set. Your task is to draft two separate agreements."

Hannah's look turned focused. "Got it. One will be an official contract with ProTech Materials Depot for the company, and the second will cover the true deal with Lightwheel Technology."

"Smart!" Calvin and Michael both chimed, their looks full of admiration.

Michael added, "We'll sort the paths and payment flows after this.Any concerns?"

Hannah replied quickly, "None at all."

With that, the session wrapped, and the attendees left, all appearing pleased.

Hannah returned to her office and locked the door.She retrieved her encrypted phone and messaged Adrian. "Adrian. thev've started. Get ready to close
the net."
###Chapter 441 She Wanted His Bodyguards
The procurement operation advanced with an oddly effortless pace.

The inflated deal with ProTech Materials Depot was skillfully sidestepped, and the shipment from Lightwheel Technology reached the docks seamlessly, with both installation and testing unfolding without complications.

The cost disparity, reaching a colossal $26 million discreetly coursed through the meticulously engineered offshore channels orchestrated by Calvin and his crew. It lingered a single step away from being funneled into the concealed repositories they commanded,prepared to disappear entirely into their hands.

An unmistakable aura of "achievement" drifted through the corridors of Luminara Group.
To honor the triumphant delivery of the pivotal components for the NeuroCore Initiative, the executives of Luminara Group hosted an extravagant evening gala.

On the eve of the festivity, Hannah carried a thermal container packed with dishes crafted by Addie, the chef, and knocked on Vincent's door at the lower level.

Vincent appeared in a charcoal loungewear set, his hair dampened as though freshly rinsed. When his gaze met Hannah, a spark of surprise flickered,swiftly giving way to a teasing intrigue. Resting against the frame, he spoke with languid amusement. "Well, this is unexpected. What brings you here all of a sudden? Aren't you going to see the young stud?"

Dismissing the playful remark, Hannah shook the thermal container slightly, a faint curve on her lips."Mr. Jones, would you care to share this dinner with me?"

Vincent arched a brow, his stare holding on to her
features for several moments. He shifted aside to let her in, his tone low as he murmured, "Are you certain? Once you step in, it's not that easy to leave."

Acting as if she hadn't registered his words, Hannah strode in without pause. "Why does your home feel deserted? It's so lifeless." She moved toward the dining table, scanning the space.

Vincent shut the door behind them, trailing her, his words edged with implication. "Perhaps because no woman has ever made it feel otherwise."

Wordlessly, Hannah began arranging the elegant courses from the thermal container.

Seated opposite one another, they commenced eating in silence. A delicate strain lingered in the room, punctuated only by the faint sounds of cutlery.

After some time, Vincent laid his forkaside, his gaze weighty as it fixed on her. "Did you truly come just to dine with me?"

Hannah raised her head, meeting his eyes with calm
resolve. "Actually, I do have a favor to ask."

Vincent leaned closer, his voice a velvet whisper."Have you made your decision? You want the Luminara Group?"

Hannah shook her head, steering the conversation abruptly. "No. I want your bodyguards."

Vincent's expression hardened instantly. His brows knit together, his voice turning sharp, laced with restrained fury. "You're interested in my bodyguards?Which one? Is he better-looking or stronger than me?"

Momentarily stunned, Hannah realized he misunderstood, a faint glimmer of amusement flickering in her eyes. "I just want to borrow your bodyguards. Your bodyguards are exceptionally skilled, and that's the quality I value."

His clenched jaw eased slightly, though his stare stayed intense. "Why exactly do you need bodyguards?"
"For my safety," Hannah replied plainly.

"Alright." He agreed without hesitation.

"Thanks," Hannah said, rising to depart. "I'll head back now."

Vincent caught her wrist, his tone colored with concern. "I'm not finished. You may call on the bodyguards whenever required. I fear that impostor could target you."

Hannah saw the worry in his eyes, remained wordless for several beats, and then nodded lightly. "Alright."

Vincent still didn't let go, instead tightening his grasp,pulling her nearer. "Don't be so quick to leave.Finish your food. I won't try anything."

"No. Tomorrow's the company gala, and I must rest early." She tugged free from his hold at last.

With that, she wasted no time, striding to the door,opening it wide, and vanishing swiftly.

Vincent dragged a hand through his hair in agitation.

Just how fearful was this woman of him daring to make a move?
###Chapter 442 The Show Begins


On the evening of the celebration banquet, the majestic hall of the Luminara Group shimmered beneath radiant ornaments.

The mood was vibrant and welcoming as the upper management and core members of the project assembled.

Calvin, Michael, and their crew gathered by the main table, their expressions gleaming with triumph.

Michael leaned closer, whispering animatedly to Calvin and several core members beside him, "Folks,this feels like our private celebration banquet! Once this concludes, the rewards will be immense for us!"

Calvin, his features glowing, lifted his glass toward Michael. "Thank you, Mr. Clark, for your backing!Following your lead is the smartest decision!"

Hannah drifted toward them, glass in hand, and
participated in their toast.

At that instant, a senior executive approached with a glass raised, grinning broadly and patting Michael's shoulder. "Michael, your performance was outstanding this round! The essential equipment for the NeuroCore Initiative has been secured, and you're the pivotal force behind it!"

Michael instantly adopted a humble and reserved posture, answering with a courteous smile, "Oh, it's nothing remarkable! I'm just fulfilling my role!Everything is for the company's interests-purely my responsibility!"

His voice rang genuine, as though the greedy man earlier was someone entirely separate.

After trading pleasantries, Michael turned to Calvin."By the way, Calvin, didn't you prepare a video? The one recording our relentless devotion to the project?I think the moment is ideal; let's let everyone witness our dedication!"

Calvin caught on immediately, his face briqhtening
with delight. "Of course, Mr. Clark! I'll show it this instant!"

Calvin hurried toward the control station at the front of the banquet hall, drawing a USB stick from his pocket and slotting it into the playback machine.

The massive display screen illuminated, drawing all gazes toward it.

The presentation began rolling.

On screen, Michael sat upright, speaking fervently into the camera, brimming with duty and vision."Everyone, the NeuroCore Initiative is the foremost strategic undertaking of the Luminara Group for the coming decade; its value is enormous! During this phase, the project members have invested everything, working tirelessly, conquering obstacles,and ultimately acquiring the crucial equipment! They have established a firm base for the project's ongoing success. Gratitude to all for your devotion."

The visuals transitioned to shots of members laboring at night, debating in sessions, and even
dozing at their desks-"touching" moments.

The background score softened into sentiment.

Michael watched his own noble image on screen, a proud smirk tugging at his lips. He was awaiting the upcoming two-minute segment solely extolling him...

Without warning, the footage shifted to a conference room. The angle clearly suggested it was secretly captured material. Faces of inner circle figures such as Michael and Calvin appeared sharply in view.

Calvin's voice reverberated through the banquet hall."This secures us a 15% margin! That's $26 million!"

Immediately, Michael's voice followed. "This is massive! As long as we draft two agreements, we'll pull it off."

The hall descended into uneasy silence and then burst into uproar. Every gaze locked on Michael and Calvin.

"$26 million? Michael orchestrating hidden deals?"
"Dual contracts? That's financial fraud! You could face prison for that!"

The whispers surged like crashing waves!

Michael's proud grin froze instantly, his complexion drained ghostly white. He spun toward the control console. "What's happening? Calvin, quickly pull it out!"

Calvin stood paralyzed, scrambling to yank the USB stick. Yet, the footage pressed on. Sweat streaming,he frantically slammed every button.

"Useless!" Michael was utterly panicked. He threw aside composure, darting toward the projector, trying to disconnect it.

However, he discovered nothing; no cord was present. It was the latest wireless HD projection system.

Hannah remained still amid the crowd, her gaze icy as she observed. The real spectacle was just beginning!
Adrian rose from his chair, his face severe. "Do you have any explanàtion?"

Calvin rushed to argue, "Mr. Miller, this is a trap! The video is counterfeit, blatantly altered to incriminate us. We've served the company faithfully; you can't believe such slander!"

Michael, too, regained his steadiness, jabbing a finger toward the display. "Mr. Miller, this must be fabricated, a setup! I've always been honorable! You can examine my bank accounts-there isn't $26million!"

At that moment, Hannah said firmly, her words ringing clear through the banquet hall, "That's only because the funds haven't arrived yet."
###Chapter 443 Tried To Kick Her Out


Calvin's tone spiked with intensity as he barked,"Natalie, what absurd claims are you making?"

Michael's face darkened instantly as the realization struck that Natalie had orchestrated this. He quelled his fury, masking it beneath a sorrowful guise of betrayal before his colleagues. Turning to the restless assembly, he urged, "Everyone, stay composed. Natalie may be holding prejudices and faulty impressions of me. Don't rely solely on her narrative!"

While speaking, Michael approached Natalie, bent slightly closer, and hissed with restrained rage,"Natalie, what's gotten into you? Why the sudden betrayal? Wanting a larger cut and more cash? Listen carefully-no matter how resentful you feel, you cannot blurt out reckless accusations here! If you dare spew nonsense again, not even a dime will go to you!"
Hannah locked on his venomous stare with a derisive curl of her lips. "Do you really believe I need that cash?"

A chill of foreboding gripped Michael. He recognized at once that this woman wasn't quibbling over payment; she was resolute about severing all ties.

Hannah pivoted away from him, sweeping her gaze across the hall. "They aren't alone in this! I hold a complete proof trail, including falsified contract replicas and the banking details used to channel dirty funds..."
"Shut up!" Mlichael cut her off, his tone carrying grim finality. "If that's how it is, I'm compelled to admit!"

"Michael?" Calvin shouted in disbelief, convinced Michael was on the verge of confessing.

Michael, however, raised a hand sharply, silencing Calvin. With a weighty look, he declared with calculated remorse, "I must confess, I neglected to keep strict oversight of my staff. I miscalculated their character! I had intended to shield Natalie from
embarrassment. The video in circulation is edited.Yes, I said words resembling those in a meeting. But the truth was: Ms. Victoria Hale made it clear-'we must enforce strict cost controI and ensure savings of at least $26 million!' But Natalie twisted that to depict me as pocketing bribes."

Pausing to let his words sink in, he added, "The true mastermind of the bribery plan is Natalie. She bluntly pushed the idea of dual contracts to skim profit during a meeting, which I rejected and criticized her for. She's probably harboring resentment and scheming to ruin me tonight. That so-called contract proof is most likely forged by her."

His eyes flared with wounded indignation."Considering her youth, I planned to discipline her privately after this celebration, giving her a chance to 'correct herself. But shockingly, she accused us first,trying to shift the blame onto us. I am devastated."

"Exactly!". Calvin promptly backed Michael. "Mr.Miller, everyone, you must see the truth! Natalie has long voiced grievances about the company and
constantly griped about her small salary! She's desperate for personal gain!"

Their allies immediately seized the moment and added their shouts in agreement.

"I've heard her rant too!"

"Not long ago, she suddenly received $30, 000 from unknown resources!"

Michael watched the uproar build, his unease easing slightly. He turned toward the wordless Adrian, who had been observing, and declared solemnly, "Mr.Miller, the evidence is plain. Natalie fabricated falsehoods, maligned her superiors, and schemed to misappropriate company property. Her behavior is gravely malignant. As her superior, I am profoundly disappointed and bear an undeniable responsibility!Therefore, I'hereby declare the immediate dismissal of Natalie, with no delay. The one-month review period I previously granted is annulled."

His final remark carried a mournful exhale, as though he were the greatest victim.
"She should've been removed ages ago; she never deserved another chance."

"This entire celebration has been spoiled by her; my mood is ruined. Please take her out."

Calvin's allies echoed the sentiment, while the rest of the staff, unaware of reality, remained stunned at the abrupt shift.

Michael curled his lips in hidden contempt.Regardless of Natalie's skill at acting, against an overwhelming crowd, she had no way to reverse it.

Michael gestured broadly, his tone glacial. "Guards,remove this troublesome liar from the celebration and from Luminara Group right away!"

Two towering guards advanced at once, moving toward Hannah.

Unafraid, Hannah calmly surveyed the gathering."You won't be rid of me."
###Chapter 444 Revealed Her Identity


With everyone's eyes fixed on the scene, Hannah advanced steadily to the front of the banquet hal and settled into the chair designated for the CEO without hesitation.

Michael burst out, "Natalie Preston! Have you lost it?What gives you the audacity to sit in that chair?"

Hannah tilted her head slightly. "Isn't this the CEO's chair?"

Calvin scoffed. "Obviously it is, which means it doesn't belong to you. Step down right now."

Hannah curled her lips. "Then that makes it mine."

Just then, Adrian-who had remained quiet-hurried forward and respectfully addressed Natalie, seated at the front, "Ms.Hale!"

The utterance sent ripples of shock across the entire
banquet space.

The staff burst into murmurs of shock and disbelief.Everyone appeared dumbfounded.

"Ms. Hale? What's that supposed to imply?"

"Is she actually Victoria Hale, the CEO? No way-how can that be?"

Michael's expression contorted wildly. He let out a harsh, derisive chuckle. "How on earth would she be the CEO? She's nothing more than a junior worker!She's clearly gone delusional from trying-and failing -to slander us!"

Calvin chimed in quickly, "Exactly! Her plan failed,and now she's snapped from the stress!"

Hannah paid no attention to their outbursts and calmly shifted her gaze toward Adrian. "Adrian,explain it to them."

Adrian immediately turned to face the restless audience and declared boldly, "Everyone, allow me to formally announce that the individual occupying the
CEO's seat is none other than the founder and the sole actual controller of Luminara Group-Victoria Hale! Her decision to return under the alias 'Natalie Preston' was to thoroughly expose the misconduct plaguing the executive level and eliminate those eroding the core of company!"

At this revelation, Michael and his allies lost all color in their faces.

The inner circle near them began whispering in anxiety, "She's really the CEO? Then we're finished!"

"She knows every last person on our side. This is the end!"

Michael spun around sharply, shooting them a glare,growling, "Be quiet! What's the use of panicking?How do we know Adrian isn't in league with her? This might alI be a charade to fool us! Pull yourselves together!"

Although dread churned in his gut, Mlichael forced a loud voice as he gazed at Natalie. "You're Ms. Hale?Then you must possess the CEO's exclusive seal.
Let's see it!"

Inside, he sneered-aware that the seal was an undisputed sign of Victoria's position, kept extremely confidential. He doubted Natalie could have it.

Hannah observed Michael's facade of bravado and desperation, her eyes glinting with frosty contempt.Even now, he refused to surrender.

Without engaging in further useless argument, she reached into her handbag and retrieved a small case.Opening it up, she revealed the seal. Holding it openly in one hand, she addressed the crowd in a cool and resonant tone, "Who said I don't have it?"

Her stare pierced through Michael. "To avoid any accusations of forgery, I suggest a few board .members who understand the group's legacy come verify it themselves. The make, material, signature,and crest of this seal cannot be replicated."

The room sank into a stunned quiet, before an eruption of louder chaos burst forth. "Whoa! That's actually Victoria's seal!"

"Unbelievable! Ms. Hale has been among us this entire time?"

"Michael and his faction are absolutely doomed!"

Michael's skin turned ashen, his limbs trembling beyond control.

Calvin was in complete disarray, seizing Michael's arm and stammering, "M-Michael, what now? A-Are we headed to jail?"

Michael shoved him off roughly, yelling, "It's not over yet! We haven't lost until the end!"

But Hannah didn't give them a chance to recover.Rising slowly to her feet, she commanded with unwavering authority, "Security! Remove these individuals for severe economic crimes and for compromising the company's integrity! Hand them over to the authorities immediately!"

Yet, despite the command, the anticipated swift response from the guards never came. The security team exchanged unsure glances, their footing hesitant, and no one stepped forward to carry out the order.
###Chapter 445 Brought In Help


Michael's face twisted with malicious delight, his laughter cutting through the air like broken glass."Ha-ha! Did you miss this little detail, did you? You think revealing you are the CEO gives you the upper hand? Let me enlighten you-the security system here was infiltrated long ago by my men! Every one of them bends to my command. Do you really think they'll listen to you? Keep dreaming!"

Hannah's expression did not waver. "It seems,indeed,they only heed your orders."

Michael's laughter swelled, swelling with arrogance."Exactly! So what if you're Victoria? Who here would obey you? Even if I decide to walk out this very moment, no one can stop me!"

Calvin grasped at a faint ray of hope. "Thankfully, Mr.Clark is always cautious!"

His clique let out a thin breath, as if clinging to a fisia lifelma

Atimem, mothoing the mounting tension, leaned close amdl whrrspenad writh worry to Hannah, "Ms. Hale, the sinuatiom is pevillous You should retreat first. I fear tiheEs uay watm yom."

Bun Hammah only shook her head, her calm gaze like still water. "No need for concern. They can neither harm me nor get out of here unscathed."

Mrichael bwrst into raucous laughter at her words, as though hearing the most absurd jest in the world.With scor dripping from his gesture, he pointed at Hannah. "Can't you see the situation yet? No one will folllow your command here. I can leave wheneverl please,and you are powerless to halt me."

Meeting his frenzied eyes, Hannah's lips curved into a faint, meaningful smile. "Is that so?"

She said no more words. Instead, she simply lifted her hand and clapped twice.

The sharp sound rang clearly through the hushed banquet hall. And then-an astonishing scene unfolded.

From every doorway and side entrance, squads of bodyguards in black suits streamed in, moving with disciplined precision. They swept across the room,descending upon the uniformed security guards.

In the blink of an eye, those security guards were disarmed, restrained, and pressed to the ground.The entire reversal was swifter than a summer storm.

Michael and his crew turned deathly pale. What on earth was happening? Where had these people appeared from?

Hannah rose gracefully, her gaze bearing down on Michael and his clique. "Now, do you still believe you can walk away?"
0
Michael's body shook, his steps faltering as he stammered in disbelief, "How... How is this possible?Where did you get so many people?"

Hannah's eyes scanned the bodyguards before returning to Michael. "They are the help I brought in.Did you think I was blind to your dealings with the security team? A glance at your accounts revealed the regular payments. You prepared a safety net, but so did l."

With that, she spared no glance at Michael's defeated expression and instead addressed the hall,"And while we gather here, let me clarify one thing.My name is not Natalie Preston, but Hannah Scott.Victoria Hale is me, and Hannah is also me."

At once, the banquet hall erupted into chaos.

"So the Luminara Group was never sold at all? It has always been under her control?"

Employees exchanged wide-eyed looks, a storm of disbelief and awe sweeping across their faces.

At that very moment, Calvin-ashen and trembling-dropped to his knees. Crawling toward the main seat,-he pleaded in a tear-choked voice, "Ms. Scott, I am sorry! Show some mercy! It was Michael who forced me! Had I refused, he would have destroyed me, left me unable to survive in this industry! I... I never wanted this. I was forced into all these shady dealings! Ms. Scott, I beg you to understand!"

Calvin's plea was like the first domino to topple.

Michael's associates quickly followed Calvin's example, dropping to their knees, each desperate to shift the blame onto Michael.

"Yes, Ms. Scott! We were coerced!"

"Michael swore he'd ruin us if we didn't obey!"

"We are victims as well, Ms. Scott!"

Michael stared at his own men betraying him, his body trembling with fury. "You... You ingrates! When spoils were divided, none of you claimed I forced you! When you pocketed the money, none of you spoke of coercion! Now you call yourselves victims?You wretched curs!"

Unable to restrain himself, Michael lunged forward and kicked Calvin viciously. "I'll finish you, you shameless bastard!" Calvin cried out in agony, rolling on the floor, yet through the pain, he still shouted, "Ms. Scott! See?This is how he threatens us-he is the true mastermind!"

Hannah's eyes, cold as winter frost, remained unmoved by the pathetic commotion. There was no pity, only distance carved in ice. Her voice rang slow and measured. "You are all cut from the same cloth."

Her gaze swept over the bodyguards, commanding,"Take everyone on my list, no exceptions."

The head of the bodyguard squad bowed at once."Yes, Ms.Scott!"

Like a tide advancing, the black-suited bodyguards seized Michael, Calvin, and all the others marked,delivering them directly to the authorities.

The once-crowded banquet hall now felt hollow, its clamor replaced by an eerie half-emptiness.
###Chapter 446 Negotiation


Hannah eased back into her chair, her sharp gaze sweeping over the remaining employees, who stil exchanged uneasy glances, visibly rattled.

She spoke deliberately, her voice steady. "Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for any distress caused.Rest assured, the acquisition of critical equipment for the NeuroCore Initiative and the project's timeline remain unaffected. The company will handle all follow-up matters to ensure seamless progress. Tonight's celebration is to honor the project's success, so please continue without letting this incident weigh on you."

v
Her words carried a calming authority, gradually easing the tension in the banquet hall.

Soft music resumed, and hushed conversations stirred among the guests. Adrian approached Hannah, his voice low with admiration. "Ms. Scott, you managed today's chaos with lightning precision-swift and resolute." He paused, a hint of confusion in his tone. "But why keep the media out? Wouldn't showcasing our crackdown on corruption have bolstered the company's image?"

Hannah shook her head, her eyes sharp with insight."There are benefits and drawbacks. Internal corruption is a stain we don't need broadcast.Protecting our core team's stability takes priority. Too much publicity could spark unwanted speculation and market volatility."

And above all, the impostor's identity remained a mystery. If the media caught wind of it, it could ignite unnecessary chaos, and she couldn't take that risk.

'Adrian nodded, absorbing her reasoning. "Ms. Scott,your foresight is impressive."

The head of the bodyguard squad,having completed the task, returned to the banquet hall to report to Hannah. Hannah gave a curt nod. "Thank you for your efforts." Taking à sip from her glass, she added,"For now, keep today's events from Vincent."

The head of the bodyguard squad hesitated, a flicker of discomfort crossing his face. "That might not be appropriate, considering we report to Mr. Jones."

Hannah's smile didn't waver, her tone firm. "Right now, you're under my command. As my team, you follow my orders. There's no need to inform him since my safety isn't at risk. I will inform him of today's events myself. Clear?"

Her piercing gaze made his heart race, sweat beading on his forehead. He inhaled deeply, stifling his unease."Understood!"

Hannah's expression softened slightly, and she "nodded. Turning to Adrian, she asked, "There's a meeting in two days about a collaboration with Vincent-deep integration on the core project,correct?"

Adrian nodded promptly, his demeanor serious. "Yes, Ms. Scott. This partnership is vital for our three-year strategic plan. Mr. Jones always sets tough terms,making negotiations a challenge."

Hannah swirled her drink thoughtfully, deciding swiftly. "I'll attend the meeting."

Adrian responded immediately. "Alright. I'll make the arrangements immediately."

Two days later, the meeting convened as planned in the top-floor conference room of the Jones Group.

Hannah didn't enter immediately, opting to remain in the waiting room, discussing negotiation details with Adrian over the phone.

Inside the conference room, tension hung thick from the start.

"Vincent, seated at the head of the table, skipped formalities and cut to the chase. He slid a hefty cooperation proposal toward Adrian. "This is our final offer for the partnership. Key terms are highlighted."

Adrian took a steadying breath and flipped open the document. As his eyes scanned the bolded clauses,his brow creased sharply.

Vincent's terms were far harsher than expected. The Jones Group demanded not only core technology sharing but also significant control over decision-making, with profi distribution heavily tilted in their favor. This was a severe blow to Luminara Group's future revenue and autonomy.

Suppressing his shock, Adrian spoke evenly. "Mr.Jones, with all due respect, your proposal is excessively demanding. The clauses on core technology sharing and decision-making authority cross our absolute limits. They don't reflect mutual benefit or a win-win outcome."

"Mutual benefit? Win-win?" Vincent leaned forward,his tone sharp and unyielding. "What leverage does "Luminara Group have to demand that from the Jones Group?"
###Chapter 447 Well Hidden


Vincent tapped the surface with subtle rhythm, his gaze unwavering. "Mr. Miller, every lasting alliance in commerce rests on strength and value. The Luminara Group's initiative unquestionably carries promise."

Pausing, he continued, "Yet, does your firm presently possess the monetary strength to shoulder the venture's ongoing studies and worldwide promotion on its own? Based on what l've seen, your recent quarterly filing reveals restricted liquidity and numerous postponed undertakings."

He reclined with composure, his tone layered with authority and certainty. "The Jones Group can deliver financing, international access, and premier technical backing that you urgently lack. Aren't such offerings.worth the price? You call it severe. But I consider it the most impartial judgment of both parties'positions and liabilities." Adrian's pulse quickened. Vincent's intelligence-gathering capabilities were disturbingly exact. He not only uncovered the Luminara Group's struggles but also pinpointed the most vulnerable spot.

Fighting to steady himself, Adrian's thoughts raced,searching for a counter. "Mr. Jones, your intelligence is accurate. But the Luminara Group's technological barriers and first-mover advantage are non-substitutable essential values! Disclosing our fundamental algorithms and system framework would equal handing over our crown jewels! That cannot happen."

He reasoned forcefully, aiming to win some room in the technical exchange issue.

However, Vincent seemed to have foreseen each ·counter in advance. He meticulously captured every flaw and hesitation in Adrian's words, rebutting each with sharper rationale and solid evidence. The rhythm of the bargaining was fully his.

Sweat gathered steadily across Adrian's brow. As the clock advanced, the negotiation froze in a deadlock.

At last, Vincent's patience thinned. Glancing at his wristwatch, he declared firmly, "Mr. Miller, my time is precious.The Jones Group's proposal is explicit. You have ten minutes to decide."

He rose deliberately, his motion exuding unwavering finality. "After ten minutes, if you refuse, the proposa is no longer on the table."

Adrian reacted instinctively, his tone urgent. "Mr.Jones, kindly wait for a bit. We require time to confer with the CEO."

Vincent halted, his face turning slightly, a cold grin curving his lips. "Confer? If you cannot call the shots,you should have brought one who can. Otherwise,you're simply wasting my time."

Meanwhile, absorbing every word through the line,Hannah concluded her call with Adrian. Vincent's negotiating manner was merciless, direct, and cutting straight to the essence. She and Adrian had earlier agreed that if he locked in the deal, she would not need to appear. Adrian had done his best. Now,her presence was required.

As Vincent moved toward leaving the room, with Adrian trailing to appeal, the door swung wide.Hannah entered with serenity.

Vincent's frigid, unyielding features froze the instant his sight caught her. Then, a genuine brightness filled his eyes. He blurted out, "Why are you here? To see me?"

Hannah shook her head, meeting his surprised gaze,and walked over to Adrian with a playful smile. "Mr.Jones, why the rush to leave? Not staying to chat a bit longer?"

Vincent stared, realization striking. She was with °Adrian. She was not here specifically to see him.

Hannah tilted her head slightly. "Didn't you say a-decision-maker should face you? I'm that person."She advanced calmly, radiating assured dominance."Let me reintroduce myself.I am Victoria Hale."
Vincent's pupils widened, his eyes fixed on Hannah's features. His lips curved with an uncontrollable smile as he sought confirmation. "You're Victoria?"

Meeting his intense gaze, Hannah stayed poised. She gave a slight nod. "Yes."

The light in Vincent's eyes intensified. He stepped closer, leaning in. "You've kept this well hidden."

Hannah stayed unshaken, her voice tinged with detachment. "You never asked."

Vincent's smile turned rueful. Truly, he hadn't asked.He never imagined they were one and the same. He had really thought she was a trivial staffer.However,her revelation that she was Victoria came as no surprise at all. With her innate pride and sharpness,she would never settle for being a merely trivial staffer. She was bound to shine from much higher.

He inhaled deeply, his look more profound. "Did you plan a year ago to acquire Luminara Group as Victoria?"Hannah acknowledged directly, "Yes. I went to great lengths to prevent you from locating me then."

"Forgive me!" Vincent burst out. He longed to say more, but those two weighty words were all that came.

Hannah's eyes flickered briefly, but her expression swiftly returned to crisp calm, pulling the dialogue firmly back. "Let's not dwell on that. Shall we continue the negotiation?"
###Chapter 448 Who Are You Meeting With
Vincent resumed his place at the head of the table,while Hannah quietly settled into the chair Adrian had vacated for her.

Dispensing with small talk, Hannah went straight for the jugular. "There is absolutely no way we can share our core technology. That is the lifeblood of the Luminara Group. Mr. Jones, this is where we draw the line."

Vincent held her gaze. Earlier, when facing Adrian, he had been all sharp and unyielding, not bulging an inch. Now, however, he showed not the slightest °resistance. With a faint nod, he simply replied,"Understood. We respect your safeguarding of core technology."

A flicker of surprise lit Hannah's eyes, though she quickly steadied herself. "On decision-making," she
continued, her tone firm, "it must remain under the direction of the Luminara Group. We hold the final word. Jones Group may adviseand oversee, but overstepping is out of the question."

Vincent studied her poised determination, the corner of his lips lifting in a small smile, equal parts admiration and indulgence. He nodded once more."Naturally. Your team will lead the project. Jones Group will stand in support."

Hannah's surprise deepened. Was this really the same Vincent who, moments ago, had been relentless in his demands? Pushing down her thoughts, she pressed on. "As for revenue sharing,Mr. Jones, your earlier proposal was plainly unjust.Luminara Group carries both the core technology and the greater risks, while Jones Group offers only 'channels and partial funding. Yet, you still asked for the lion's share? That's unreasonable."

Vincent leaned back slightly, resting against his chair,his gaze intently locked on her with a near-transparent concession. He drummed his fingerslightly on the table and then made his decision."Sixty percent to Luminara Group, forty to Jones Group. Does that suit you?"

The moment those words fell, silence engulfed the room.

Adrian's eyes widened. Only minutes earlier, Vincent had clung stubbornly to a seventy-thirty split-perhaps even more in his favor. And now? He was giving ground, offering a sixty-forty tilted toward Luminara Group?

Hannah, too, was momentarily stunned. Meeting Vincent's profound eyes, she felt a storm rise quietly within her chest. Yet, her face betrayed nothing.Coolly,she answered, "That would be perfect."

Vincent turned toward his secretary, his tone cold and businesslike. "Draft a new contract based on my discussion with Ms. Scott. The core terms are these:-no sharing of core technology, Luminara Group leads all decisions, and profits split sixty-forty in Luminara Group's favor. Immediately." "Yes, Mr. Jones. At once!" the secretary replied,gathering the documents before swiftly leaving the room.

Adrian stood frozen in disbelief, glancing from Vincent to Hannah. Had they just reached an agreement?

Just a while back, Adrian had labored tirelessly to budge Vincent's terms and failed each time. Yet,Hannah had spoken a handful of words, and Vincent not only yielded but offered concessions freely.Since when had Vincent been so easy to sway? Then what was the meaning of all his earlier stubbornness?

Adrian felt like the punchline of a cruel joke.

Thus, the negotiation-expected to be a battle of 'attrition-ended with astonishing ease.

Hannah rose, her gaze calm yet tinged with curiosity.-"Mr. Jones, your sudden agreeableness is out of character. I thought we'd be locked in the negotiation for another hour at least." Vincent also stood and checked his watch. "It's nearly lunchtime. Would you care to join me for a meal?"

Hannah shook her head gently, her voice polite but distant. "Lunch won't be necessary/. I already have another engagement."

She referred to Claude. The moment he learned she had resolved the company's embezzlement crisis, he had invited her out to celebrate.

Vincent's expression did not falter, though a faint shadow of disappointment crossed his eyes. He inclined his head. "Very well."

Hannah extended her hand. "In that case, Mr. Jones,here's to a fruitful collaboration."

Vincent clasped her hand lightly. "To a fruitful collaboration."

Withdrawing her hand, Hannah added, "And thank you for assigning the bodyguards. They proved both effective and disciplined."

But Vincent's thoughts were already elsewhere, His gaze remained intent on her, brushing aside her gratitude with a question of his own. "Who are you meeting with?"

Hannah's brows drew together, her tone chilled."Mr.Jones, that is a private matter."

Sensing the tension, Adrian quickly stepped in,forcing a smile. "Mr. Jones, Ms. Scott truly has a full schedule. How about I treat you to lunch instead? We can go over the finer details of the collaboration."

Vincent did not so much as glance his way. "Nah."

Adrian's smile froze, and he retreated in awkward silence.

After the negotiation, Vincent personally escorted Hannah downstairs. In the lobby, they found Claude waiting, a large bouquet of yellow roses in his hands.

The instant Claude spotted Hannah, he strode forward eagerly. "Anna, congratulations! A resounding success." He presented the bouquet with both hands.

Hannah accepted it graciously. "Thank you, Claude."

Vincent lingered a step behind Hannah, his presence radiating a quiet, icy pressure. "Mr. Hobbes," he remarked, his voice like a cold blade, "you seem remarkably well-informed."

Claude, having rushed over the moment he heard of her presence at the Jones Group, met Vincent's gaze with open hostility. "Not as well-informed as you, Mr.Jones."

If not for his recent workload, Claude would never have allowed Vincent the opportunity to draw closer to HHannah. Erica was simply incompetent, still failed to capture Vincent's heart despite wearing Hannah's face
###Chapter 449 Blind Date


After exchanging a few polite words, Claude swiftly guided Hannah into the car. He drove her to an upscale restaurant famed for its exclusivity.

Inside a private room, Claude personally drew out a chair for Hannah, a gesture both thoughtful and attentive.

Lifting his glass with a broad smile, Claude said,"Anna, congratulations once again! You steered today's storm with steady hands, clearing away the troublemakers from your company."

Hannah raised her glass and clinked it lightly against his, a soft smile lingering on her lips. "Thank you,Claude."

Claude set his glass down and leaned forward, his voice tinged with concern. "By the way, when did you cross paths with Vincent? I thouight you would have avoided him." Though his tone sounded casual, his eyes fastened firmly on Hannah's face.

Hannah stayed composed, her reply light as air. "We bumped into each other not long ago-pure chance."

She paused and then added to gauge his reaction,"He seemed so startled to see me that he doubted I was even Hannah. I found that rather amusing."

Hannah studied Claude closely, catching the faint flicker in his eyes.

"It is amusing." Claude agreed quickly, shifting the subject as smoothly as turning a page. "Oh, and I heard Vincent's bodyguard lent you great helpo at the celebration dinner?"

Hannah nodded without hesitation. "Yes, his bodyguards were of great help at that moment."

A shadow of disappointment brushed across Claude's face. "Why didn't you ask me? You know,my people are always at your service."

Hannah looked at him and said calmly, "Weren't you busy then? I didn't wish to trouble you."

"That's not correct to think like that, Claude countered, his gaze intent. "For me, you always come first. Next time, don't think twice-no matter how busy I appear, l'll be there for you. In Dorbarrow,I am as close to you as family."

He added pointedly, "After all, you're Vincent's ex-wife. If you stay too close to him, tongues will wag.Misunderstandings are born in whispers, and they can grow into storms. Don't you agree?" At last, his true concern surfaced.

Meeting his gaze, Hannah replied vaguely,"I understand, Claude."

Although her answer didn't fully satisfy him,he kept his warm smile. "Alright, let's leave it at that. Once we finish dinner, I'll take you somewhere to unwind."


******

After the meal, Claude brought Hannah to a  high-end private fencing club. He introduced it withenthusiasm. "Anna, you're always carrying the weight of troubles. It's time to loosen the knots. Fencing sharpens the mind and eases the spirit.I'll teach you -you'll learn quickly."

Hannah wanted to say she already knew how to play.

Just then, a woman's surprised voice rang from nearby. "Claude? Is that you?"

Claude turned at once, his brow creasing instinctively.

There stood Lindsay Cortez, clad in a fitted sports outfit, a professional fencing bag slung over her shoulder, her eyes wide with surprise.

Lindsay, the daughter of the chairman of Cortez Tech,was the recent match arranged for Claude by ·his family.

Recently, Claude's so-called busy days had largely been consumed by handling the activities arranged by the Hobbes family for matching him up with Lindsay. Claude hadn't expected to encounter Lindsay here.

Lindsay stepped closer, her gaze flicking between Claude and Hannah with subtle curiosity. "Claude,didn't you say you had no time to meet today? And who might this be?"

Hannah extended her hand, her voicecool yet courteous. "Hello, I'm Hannah Scott."

Lindsay hesitated and then reached out briefly for a handshake. "Hello, I'm Lindsay Cortez. May I know your relationship with him?"

Hannah replied naturally, "I'm his family."

Claude instantly chimed in, emphasizing, "Not by blood." He seemed anxious to make the distinction clear.
。
Following his lead, Hannah added, "Yes, not by blood, but close enough to be family."

Turning back to Lindsay, Hannah asked politely, "And who are you to Claude?" Claude cut in first, "Just a business associate. She's the heiress of Cortez Tech." His tone suggested he would rather not linger on the subject.

"I'm Claude's blind date," Lindsay said, frowning slightly.

A flicker of surprise touched Hannah's eyes. She smiled and asked, "Blind date? Since when did you two have a blind date?"

Claude's expression darkened, and he quickly explained, "My family forcefully arranged it for me.I never wanted it..."

Lindsay's smile stiffened at his blunt and chilly words. Watching him, she sensed his natural warmth toward Hannah. She didn't believe for a second that he only saw Hannah as a sisterly figure. Deep down,her instincts whispered that something was off. The true nature of their relationship eluded her.

Yet, Lindsay smoothed her expression,swallowed her doubts, and said with an easy smile, "Since fate has us meet here, why don't we have fun together?"
###Chapter 450 Vincent Taught Me


Hannah was about to reply with a simple "okay," yet Claude beat her to it with a calm refusal. "No.Lindsay, you go ahead. Hannah's still new, and l ought to guide her."

Lindsay's smile collapsed in an instant. Her face turned complicated, but after a brief hesitation, she managed a reluctant nod. "Alright."

As Lindsay pivoted toward her locker, she couldn't resist stealing glances at Claude and Hannah. She had fallen for Claude at first sight, but it was plain as day-his heart wasn't tilted in her direction.

.Lindsay's eyes lingered as Claude attentively helped Hannah select protective gear, explaining each technique with patient care.

With every passing moment, Lindsay's gaze grew colder, like frost quietly spreading across glass. Claude lifted a brand-new white fencing suit and held it out. "Hannah, try this one; it looks like it'll fit."He then reached for the chest protector. "Here, let me help you put this on. We'll talk through the techniques afterward."

As he spoke, he stepped closer, carefully securing the gear in place for her.

Once Hannah was suited up, Claude began outlining the fundamentals of fencing.

He demonstrated the stance, the grip, and the thrust,signaling for Hannah to follow along. She imitated him with steady cooperation.

"Yes, just like that! Now sink lower-keep your weight grounded." Claude's voice carried patient firmness as he lifted his foil. "Let's try a simple bout. I'lI keep it slow so you can grasp the rhythm and distance."

He took his stance and beckoned her to attack.

Hannah advanced as instructed, driving her foil forward. Olauce derflached it with ease.

The hwo exohanged moves again and again.

But elfter several rounds, Claude's sharp eyes caught somathing unusual-Hannah's reflexes and footwork were ffar too polished for a beginner.

whern he pressed her with s slightly quicker move,she insminctivaly produced a perfect counterattack,tenmbook in torm.

A spark of surprise lit Claude's gaze. He lowered his meapon, genuinely impressed. "Hannah, you're learning at lightning speed. Your reactions and steps don't look like those of s beginner st all."

Hannah stayed silent for a moment before breaking into a candid smile, her tone carrying a hint of apology. "Claude, truth is... I already know how to fence."

Claude blinked, taken aback. "You do?"

She nodded. "Yes. Vincent taught me." Vincent again. Claude's expression dimmed, a shadow crossing his face. "Why didn't you mention that sooner?"

Hannah softened her voice. "Claude, I'm sorry. I truly didn't mean to hide it. You seemed so enthusiastic,and I didn't want to spoil your mood. Besides, it's been ages since I practiced, so I'm rusty."

She paused and then lifted her foil, pointing it toward him with a bright shift of tone. "How about we test ourselves in a real match?"

Claude's smile returned, tinged with competitive spirit."Gladly-but I won't hold back."

Hannah's lips curved faintly. "Nor will I, Claude."

Claude struck first, his foil darting toward her.

°But Hannah's reaction was swifter-she sidestepped neatly, evading his thrust. Her wrist flicked, the foil snapping back with precision toward his underarm.

After a flurry of exchanges, Claude found himself gradually cornered, unable to break through her defense.

Again, with a sharp clang, Hannah landed a clean hit.The bout was decided.

Claude lowered his blade and offered an honest smile. "I'm impressed. You've bested me fair and square."

Hannah exhaled, her cheeks lightly flushed from the exercise. "You went easy on me, Claude."

Meanwhile, in the upstairs gallery of the fencing club,Vincent had just concluded his negotiation with Hannah and moved on to casual business talk with a key overseas partner. They sat by the window,overlooking the wide training hall below.

Lifting his coffee cup, Vincent let his gaze wander °arelessly until it suddenly froze mid-motion. Two familiar figures had caught his eye: Hannah and Claude.

Vincent had watched from the moment  they donned their gear and sparred together. The longer Vincent observed, the darker his mood became, like clouds gathering before a storm.

Across the table, his business partner noticed the shift in his expression and grew uneasy. "Mr. Jones?Is something the matter? Are you unwell?"

Vincent forced his composure back, masking the storm behind calm eyes. His reply came low and cold. "It's nothing... I simply saw someone I'd rather not see."
###Chapter 451 Keep Your Distance Before Trouble Finds You
After finishing a round of fencing with Claude,Hannah headed toward the restroom when, at the bend of the hallway, she ran into Lindsay.

Lindsay had been lurking there, watching Hannah and Claude like a hawk.

With her arms crossed and her shoulder resting lazily against the wall, Lindsay's eyes burned with hostility as they fixed on Hannah. "You do have a knack for fencing.Your strikes are crisp, your shifts between offense and defense as smooth as flowing water...Hardly the clumsy touch of a beginner." A cold,mocking smile tugged at her lips. "But your tricks are a little underhanded, aren't they?"

Hannah paused mid-step, her brow furrowing as she met Lindsay's gaze. "Underhanded?" Straightening her posture, Lindsay moved a step closer, her tone sharp. "Drop the act. I've seen right through you. You're feigning inexperience just to get Claude to teach you, making excuses for close contact, letting him adjust your gear, and guiding your hand as if you needed the help. Hah,those little tricks may fool men, but not me."

Hannah frowned, her voice carrying a quiet edge of frost. "You're mistaken. Claude and l..."

"What?" Lindsay cut in, temper breaking loose."Wanting to claim you two are just closer than family,though not related by blood? Ha! I say you're hiding some agenda!"

"I don't understand this hostility. Claude and I are just like family. Nothing more than that," Hannah replied, her brow creased. She turned slightly, ready to leave, unwilling to waste another breath.

But Lindsay stepped into her path. "How about a match between us?"

"And why should I compete with you?" Hannah asked
calmly, a faint smile playing across her lips. "Just because you think l've taken your Claude? You're upset and want to prove something? And I must duel to satisfy your jealousy?"

She gave a slight shake of her head, her eyes filled with unmasked disdain."I have no interest in childish games. If it were just for sport, perhaps I'd humor you,but a duel to feed your pride? I will pass."

Her nonchalant refusal fanned Lindsay's anger into flame. Her voice rose likea whip crack. "Not interested? Or simply afraid? I can't fathom why Claude would favor someone so timid!"

Hannah regarded Lindsay's flushed, frustrated face,her eyes devoid of any remaining emotion. The confrontation had run its course. Her voice, cool and detached, left no room for argument. "Think whatever you like, as long as it helps you find sleep at night."

And with that, Hannah brushed past Lindsay without a backward glance, making her way to the restroom. Left behind, Lindsay stood trembling with fury, her face pale with rage, her chest rising and falling heavily.

When Hannah emerged from the restroom and reached the hallway corner, a tall figure appeared suddenly before her. She nearly collided with him and instinctively drew back. Lifting her eyes, she saw Vincent. Steadying herself, she frowned slightly."What are you doing here?"

Vincent's gaze was steady, almost searing, as though he could read every thought behind her eyes.His lips pressed into a thin line. After a long silence,he gave a dismissive excuse. "Just passing by."

Hannah arched an eyebrow, teasing lightly. "Passing by near the restroom? That's convenient."

For a moment, Vincent was struck speechless. His expression darkened. He quickly shifted the subject."You and Claude seem to be enjoying yourselves at fencing."

"How did you know?" Hannah countered.

His face soured-she had admitted it mtrs.t hesitation. "I saw it while passing by," he sad st m that flat tone.

Inside, Hannah found the who'e exchange rather absurd, but outwardly, she stayed composed. giving only a soft "Hmm" before trying to move past h'm."I've things to attend to. I'll be on my way."

But Vincent's arm shot out, barring her path. Leaning forward, his gaze pierced hers. "Heading back to fence with Claude again?"

Hannah raised her eyes to meet him squarely. "And if lam?"

"You can't," Vincent declared as if it were self-evident. "I don't like him."

,"Mr. Jones, that's overstepping." Hannah's tone was distant, a wall between them.

"Claude is soon to be engaged to Lindsay Cortez.She's not one to trifle with. Take my advice: keep
your distance before trouble finds you." His words carried the weight of warning, his ears having clearly caught the earlier clash between her and Lindsay.

But Hannah's reply was no less sharp. "Then let me remind you, Mr. Jones-I'm no easy mark myself.Perhaps you should take your own advice and keep your distance from me."

With that, she seized a brief moment of his distraction, slipped away under his extended hand,and left the restroom behind.

Back at the training hall, the air was busier than before. New arrivals in formal suits were speaking with Claude.

Not far off stood Lindsay. Spotting Hannah, she let a cold smirk curl across her face. "Well, well. We were just speaking of you-and here you are."
###Chapter 452 Wager


Hannah moved steadily toward the outskirts of the gathering, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar figures present before resting firmly on Claude. Her tone was level. "Were you talking about me?"

Claude advanced with a formal bearing, eager to explain. "Anna, these gentlemen are my principal business associates, Nikolas MacLeod and Elvin Cortez, CEO of their own companies. They happened to witness us fencing and suggested a lighthearted contest to make things more engaging. Mr.MacLeod,Mr. Cortez, allow me to introduce the CEO of Luminara Group, Ms. Scott."

Claude attempted to ease the atmosphere.

Hannah lifted her brow. "So? In what way does this involve me?"

Before Claude managed a reply, Nikolas, a middle-aged man, interjected with a smile, his attention lingering on Hannah with faint insolence, "Such a striking woman! Mr. Hobbes, you certainly recognize beauty when you see it!"

Nikolas paused, his tone edged with the cunning calculation of a seasoned trader. "We made a small wager earlier, just to add some excitement. The bet is on which of our dates will prevail in the contest. My stake is a valuable development parcel on the outskirts of the city."

Elvin added swiftly, "My daughter has loved fencing from her youth, and she will represent our Cortez Tech. If she should fail, I will yield our advanced chip technology licenses for ten years!"

Lindsay cut in immediately, her voice ringing with pride. "Don't worry, Dad. I'll bring you victory."

Hannah realized at once that Elvin was Lindsay's father.

Claude hurried to add, "On my side, Hannah, if you lose, Fontaine Galleria will provide every premier exhibition location within its prime commercial zones for a full decade!"

Hannah listened without change of expression. "So you decided a bet on me without seeking my agreement?"

Claude's chest tightened, and he hurriedly said, "No,Anna, you've taken it wrongly. I meant to enter the contest myself."

Lindsay sliced in sharply from nearby. "Claude!Everyone just agreed that the dates would compete.What now? Since Ms. Scott objects, you're withdrawing? That looks dishonorable, doesn't it?"

Nikolas and Elvin echoed Lindsay's remarks with quick approval.

Claude disregarded Lindsay, keeping his gaze locked upon Hannah's expression. "Anna, are you upset? L..."

Hannah held herself steady despite clear annoyance."Claude, you ought to have spoken with me beforehand, not presented this after deciding."

"Forgive me, Anna, I overlooked that. You shouldn't feel any burden. Just treat this as a pastime."Claude's eyes stayed firm on Hannah, calm and unwavering.

He knew Hannah might be displeased, yet he still risked the gamble. He couldn't suppress the urge to test his place in her heart. He believed Hannah would never permit him to forfeit the wager. She wouldn't want him to lose. He relished seeing her fight on his behalf. It exhilarated him.

Hannah held his gaze."And if I lose?"

Claude's expression was hopeful. "I want you to win."

Reading the expectancy in Claude's eyes, Hannah felt her last shred of hesitation vanish. She abruptly smiled. The expression was glacial and detached,emphasizing her determination to take charge.

Hannah shifted away from Claude and addressed his business associates, who were watching with anticipation, her voice ringing throughout the foncing hall with crisp strength, "I believe there's confusion. I am not Mr. Hobbes' date. Wo are morely frienda, here for leisure."

At once, Claude's features altered slightly. Did that imply she would not compete for him?

Hannah halted,sweeping her gaze across the arena,and declared, "Since everyone here is so eager to gamble, I'll introduce my own stake. If I fall, I will yield 15% of Luminara Group's shares. But if I succeed...

Her look turned razor sharp, gliding over Nikolas,then Elvin, and finally Claude. Her tone was firm and cold. "If | succeed, I claim everything you've wagered."

She rejected being treated as the wager. She intended to be the one placing the gamble. If a game existed, she would grasp a share of the spoils.

·The fencing hall burst into murmurs. The crowd was stunned that Hannah controlled 15% of Luminara Group. They realized they had underestimated her.

Lindsay's face grew bitter. The playful amusement on Nikolas' and Elvin's faces evaporated, replaced by astonishment and hunger.

Nikolas' eyes gleamed. He reacted first, clapping and laughing. "Magnificent! Such boldness! Who could have known Mr. Hobbes' friend is this feisty? We accept this gamble."

Lindsay fixed her eyes on Hannah and declared,"You're bound to lose."

Just then, Vincent descended the winding staircase in a grand entrance, his voice echoing across the hall. "I'll join the gamble. I'll stake a mineral vein.My wager is that Ms. Scott will prevail." He gestured firmly toward Hannah.

###Chapter 453 Raised The Stakes


Vincent's sudden appearance, coupled with the soaring stakes, instantly sent a current crackling through the air.

Nikolas and Elvin exchanged a glance.

Claude's face darkened like a storm cloud at Vincent's unexpected arrival. He broke the silence first, his voice heavy with hostility and edged with displeasure. "Mr. Jones? What business brings you here?"

Vincent didn't so much as spare Claude a glance. His gaze locked firmly on Hannah as he replied, steady .and sure, "Since it's a wager, everyone has the right to join."

He then directed his next words at Hannah, his tone softening with quiet assurance. "Have fun in the competition. I'm fine with the outcome." A faint tremor stirred in Hannah's heart. She arched a brow. "Miss Cortez seems to stand the stronger chance of winning. Why not put your bet on her and guarantee your profit?"

Vincent's lips curved into the shadow of a smile. "I won't change my bet. Whether you win or lose, it doesn't matter. The Jones Group can handle it."

His words carried the weight of confidence yet the ease of nonchalance.

A subtle ripple flickered in Hannah's eyes.

Meanwhile, Elvin drew Lindsay aside. His voice dropped to a low murmur, eyes gleaming with both calculation and greed. "Lindsay, do you have the confidence to take the match?"

。"Of course," Lindsay answered without hesitation,her tone brimming with pride. "None of them are my equals."

Years of fencing since childhood had honed Lindsay's skill, and she dismissed Hannah's earlier victory over Claude as no more than Claude deliberately holding back.

Seeing his daughter's unwavering confidence, Elvin's eyes lit with a greedy spark. He clapped her shoulder with vigor. "Excellent, let's seize this chance!Vincent's presence makes it perfect. Time to raise the stakes!"

Straightening his suit, Elvin wore the polished smile of a seasoned businessman and strode briskly toward Vincent. "Mr. Jones, you've wagered a precious mine with your own hand. Bold indeed! But honestly, I expected something much more valuable from you than that, given your stature.Why not make things a bit more funny?"

He leaned closer, voice sharp with provocation."Mr.Jones, do you dare wager Jones Group's shares?Now that would truly befit your standing!"

His words drew every eye in the room to him.

Vincent regarded Elvin's greedy expression with an icy gaze. Without a flicker of hesitation, he replied inchiling calm, "Alright. Fifteen percent of Jones Group shares-equal to Ms. Scott's stake. I bet on her triumph."

The crowd stirred in disbelief. Vincent had actually agreed!

Elvin's face split into a grin of unrestrained joy."Splendid! MAr. Jones, that's what I call decisiveness!"He wheeled around and whispered urgently to Lindsay, "Did you hear that? Fifteen percent of Jones Group shares! You must win this duel at all costs!"

The sheer weight of her father's expectation tightened Lindsay's chest, yet her confidence in her ability never wavered. She nodded firmly. "Rest assured! Victory will only be mine."

Nikolas, too, felt his blood stirred by the staggering 'stakes. He leaned close to his date, Aylin Brewer,and whispered eagerly, "Did you hear that? If we seize this, we'll be set for life! Give it your everything!"

Vincent observed Elvin's and Nikolas's greedy faces,his eyes flashing with a cold light. Then, with
deliberate force, he spoke. "Since I've laid down such a heavy wager, it's only fitting that you raise yours as well. Otherwise, wouldn't this whole gamble fall flat?"

Claude furrowed his brows, bewildered at Vincent's intentions.

But Elvin, caught up in the excitement of his fantasy,instantly rose to the bait. "Of course! I'll add twenty million!"

Vincent's lips curved into a mocking smile. "Merely twenty million? It's a bit low, but it'll do."

Elvin's grin faltered. He had intended to say two million, but in his excitement, twenty million had slipped from his tongue. Ten times over. And yet,Vincent had dismissed it as a not-too-big amount.

·Elvin's face flushed crimson, but convinced of his daughter's sure victory, he nodded as he confirmed his stakes.

Claude and Nikolas, cornered by the two's rising stakes, ground their teeth and followed suit. 
Claude put forward ten luxury yachts, while Nikolas staked a brand-new commercial building in the heart of the city.

The wagers soared to a suffocating height, and the training ground's atmosphere tightened like a bowstring.

Hannah frowned slightly, stepped to Vincent's side,and lowered her voice. "Can't you see? Elvin is setting his sights on you!"

Vincent tilted his head just enough to answer. "I see it."

Her worry pressed forward. "If I lose, fifteen percent of your company's shares wilI vanish in an instant!"

Vincent's eyes locked on her, steady and unwavering, brimming with trust. "I said I'm fine with any outcome. Just enjoy the duel without any concern or burden."
###Chapter 454 The Duel Begun


Lindsay and Aylin were the first to step onto the fencing strip.

Lindsay's eyes gleamed sharply as she struck with ferocity; her blade lunged like lightning, her footwork brisk and unrelenting, each move aimed straight at vital openings.

Aylin, though no novice, stood her ground with a steady defense, and the two quickly founy themselves locked in a duel where neither woukt yield an inch.

At the edge of the platform, Hannah watched in silence, her gaze riveted on Lindsay's movements as if studying every detail with hawk-like intensity.

At some point, Vincent appeared by her side, his posture relaxed, his tone confident as he remarked "They're not half as skilled as you." Hannah did not turn her head her eyes locked on Lindsay "And why are you so sure?"

A faint sm le curved Vincent's I ps, his gaze carrying depth like still waters that run deep. "I just know it."

Just then, Claude approached and gave her shoulder a reassuring pat. "Hannah, just play your usual game.No need for nerves."

She inclined her head slightly, her reply calm and unwavering."Alright."

Her focus returned to the strip. With a keen eye, she noticed Lindsay's habit-whenever she pressed the attack, she often struck toward the opponent's underarm.

Moreover, whenever Lindsay shifted to a defensive block against a thrust, a fleeting gap opened at her lower right abdomen. The window was brief, a mere heartbeat long, yet enough for Hannah to seize upon when the time came.

The clash on the strip reached its end. Dwawing upon her wider experience ad ruierss style, Lindsay finally securedThe victory

"Well donel" Elvin bursit MRO YBUCDUS aDMSA.laughter booming from his chest, his face glowing with triumph. He turned smugly to Nikolss, whose expression mes already ciouded with trushvation "Ha-ha! Mr. MacLeod, r'l be taking What land and property without hesitation!"

Nikolas's eyes fell on Aylin, trudging off the fiekd in defeat. His voice dropped to a growd,anger simmering beneath his breath. "Usaless."

Elvin's jeer fanned Nikoles' fury, and he snapped back, voice tight with restrained rage, "Don't start celebrating yet, Mr. Cortez! Your daughter wont necessarily win every round!"

Confidence shone from Elvin's face; arrogance roda his every word. Casting a disdainful glance toward Hannah, he scoffed. "Mr. MacLeod, I have full confidence in my daughter. I invested much in nurturing her. Fencing is second nature to her. As for that Hannah-my men have just checked her background. Hailed from a modest family. Likely never éngaging with such an elite sport as fencing.She's just pretending to be skilled! My daughter is bound to win. And an easy win,no less."

Nikolas's frustration only deepened, his chest burning with outrage.

Lindsay, removing her helmet, walked forward wearing the pride of a victor. Her voice brimmed with smugness as she said to Hannah, "You still have time to give up. At least then, you won't lose too disgracefully."

Meeting Lindsay's challenging gaze, Hannah's tone was calm, her eyes steady. "You haven't competed with me yet. How can you be so certain I'll lose?"

.Hannah's unflinching reply lit a spark of admiration in Vincent's eyes. He relished this side of her-the spirit that refused to bend.

Claude, too, found himself drawn to this quiet defiance.Without wasting more words on Lindsay, Hannah walked toward the equipment area to choose her foil.

Vincent lifted his hand ever so slightly. At once, a manager stepped forward, presenting a finely crafted case toward Hannah with utmost respect. When opened, it revealed a silver-white foil, its hilt adorned with subtle patterns of elegance.

"You should wield this one," Vincent said in a low voice. It was his personal saber, forged from aerospace-grade alloy-light as a feather, yet bending with perfect resilience. He kept it stored at this club, using it for his entertainment whenever he visited.

Hannah studied the blade and then accepted it. The foil sat comfortably in her hand, almost as if it belonged there. She nodded once. "Thank you."

Seeing this, Claude hastened to pick up the protective gear, preparing to assist. "Hannah, the gear."

But before Claude could act, Vincent raised his hand
again.

At once, the professional staff, waiting nearby,stepped forward and efficiently dressed Hannah in her fencing equipment.

Vincent's eyes flicked toward Claude, his words smooth but edged. "I've already arranged everything. Mr. Hobbes, no need to trouble yourself."

Claude's hand stiffened mid-air, his face darkening in silence.

Once fully equipped, Hannah flexed her wrist, her words measured. "Let's begin."

Hannah and Lindsay stepped onto the fencing piste,squaring off.

The referee's hand came down. "Begin!"
0
A ruthless glint sparked in Lindsay's eyes. Without even testing the waters, she hurled herself into attack.

Hannah seemed pressed back under thestorm of blows. Her footing wavered, her guard strained, and she was driven to parry and retreat again and again.

Lindsay scored her points again and again.

Elvin's laughter rang out, filled with certainty. "Mr.Jones, it looks like my daughter has the match in her pocket once again."

Vincent's smirk cut cold as steel. "It's too early to call the outcome."

"Oh, she's the one who'll win," Nikolas suddenly commented.

Elvin, brimming with certainty, replied without missing a beat, "Of course-my daughter will claim the victory."

"I wasn't speaking of her," Nikolas countered at once,his tone like iron striking flint. "I meant Ms. Scott will be the one to triumph."

Elvin froze, momentarily caught off guard. "What did you just say?"
###Chapter 455 She Won


The clash of blades rang sharply, filling the hall with harsh echoes.

Hannah appeared trapped in pure defense, unable to muster any strike of her own.

Across the fencing piste, Lindsay dominated the exchange with ease.

Elvin exhaled with satisfaction. "Mr. MacLeod, I know envy burns in you, but reckless words should be avoided, yes? My daughter's victory is plain."

Elvin shifted his gaze to Claude with smug amusement. "Claude, recognize Lindsay's brilliance,and perhaps stop having your sight only on your acquaintance a little."

Claude grasped the hidden barb within Elvin's speech. His hands curled into fists, though he kept his expression steady, answering, "Mr. Cortez,you're right."

Claude's chest grew heavy as he observed Hannah constantly giving ground, his spirit sinking deeper each time she stepped back. It seemed inevitable that Hannah would lose the game. Lindsay looked certain to secure triumph. Irritation pushed him to massage his temples.

Nikolas resisted arguing with Elvin, instead whispering to Aylin, "Are you certain Hannah will prevail?"

Aylin answered, "From what I see, it looks that way.Ms. Scott hasn't released her true force; she's only assessing for now."

Nikolas kept his eyes fixed on the duel. "Elvin's arrogance is unbearable. I pray Hannah wins.Hopefully, your reading is accurate."

Vincent also watched intently, unaffected by Hannah's apparent disadvantage. Instead, a confident smile surfaced, filled with quiet admiration. Vincent had seen through it. Though Hannah appeared at a disadvantage, every backward step,each deflecting motion, and every dodge struck with exact calculation. She was holding back deliberately.She was merely tiring Lindsay out, while observing and gathering her strength.

She deliberately allowed Lindsay to dominate,coaxing the latter into a false sense of sure victory and lowering her guard, and thus exposing more weaknesses.

Vincent chuckled. Hannah's strike was imminent.

On the fencing piste, Lindsay brimmed with arrogance, slashing while sneering, "Hah, that's all you've got? You're hopeless against me! Just give in!"

Underneath her helmet, Hannah's lips curled into a cold smile. Her voice was calm as she replied,"That's not true."

Before the final syllable left her lips, Hannah's presence shifted explosively. Her movements grew nimble, no longer ceding ground but pressing forward in fierce pursuit.

With a lightning lunge, Hannah pierced at the flaw Lindsay unknowingly revealed on her lower right side.

Lindsay yanked her foil back to defend, already too late. She cursed inwardly that she would only permit this one strike.

But this was merely the opening. Hannah's charge grew fiercer, her foil flashing relentlessly, sending Lindsay backward in haste.

Where moments ago Lindsay had carried overwhelming force, now she staggered helplessly-gaps erupting constantly in her guard.

Hannah drove her momentum higher, alternating bursts of speed and measured shifts-until Lindsay's rhythm broke entirely.

In stunned silence, Hannah erased the deficit and then surged ahead in mere heartbeats. Point after point fell to her. "No... Impossible!" Lindsay shrieked, panic warping her attacks into wild chaos.

In the final moments, Hannah struck clean against Lindsay's chest protector with surgical accuracy.

The scoring lamp flashed instantly.

"Match finished! Victor-Hannah Scott!" the referee's voice thundered through the venue.

Claude blinked hard. Hannah actually triumphed?And so resoundingly, so flawlessly? An ecstatic rush overwhelmed him, forcing a cheer from his lips."Amazing, Hannah! Truly brilliant!"

Vincent remained seated, wearing a knowing grin, his eyes glowing with both admiration and pride. He had always believed she would emerge victorious.

Year back, during Hannah's pursuit of Vincent, she'd insisted he teach her fencing, pestering him until he'd ultimately relented. He had taken her along to the club, letting her train whenever possible.
 
Their bond had ignited swiftly during those sessions. It was during one of those times she had first brushed a kiss against his cheek. But once wed,they never crossed foils together again.

Vincent gathered his thoughts. He had always sensed Hannah's innate gift in fencing. Her triumph came as no surprise to him.

Nikolas regarded Lindsay's defeated demeanor and then glanced at Elvin's furious face, bursting into laughter."Well now! Mr. Cortez, how unbelievable that your daughter lost despite her skills honed through multiple training sessions! And lost so thoroughly. Ha-ha! Seems your earlier confidence was misplaced after all!"

Elvin's complexion turned crimson with rage. His glare bore into Hannah as she calmly lowered her foil,his eyes seething with disbelief, fury, and humiliation.His carefully laid scheme for the prized Jones Group shares had collapsed entirely. The surge of fury made him dizzy, nearly toppling.

Lindsay,broken, removed her mask, her skin ghostly,voice quivering with denial. "No... Impossible! How did you defeat me? There's no way you could have beaten me fairly! You must have cheated!"
###Chapter 456 Help Her Cheat


Hannah pulled off her helmet, a thin sheen of sweat shimmering across her forehead. Her eyes drifted toward Lindsay, who still couldn't accept defeat.Curling her lips in a mocking smile, she remarked,"You'll need to sharpen your skills. There's plenty of room for growth."

Without sparing Lindsay another glance, Hannah shifted her attention to Vincent, who had been quietly watching from the sidelines. She lifted the sword in her hand and said lightly, "Nice sword."

Vincent met her gaze, his eyes unfathomably deep,a faint smile tugging at his lips. "It's yours now."

Hannah froze for a moment, startled, and was just about to decline when Lindsay's shrill cry sliced through the air like broken glass. "Ha! I knew you couldn't beat me fair and square!"

Lindsay jabbed a finger at the sword in Hannah's grasp, her voice grating with fury. "You cheated! You only beat me because of that sword. There must be something wrong with it! Otherwise, hnow could you possibly win me?"

Turning on Elvin, Lindsay cried, "Dad, I didn't lose!She cheated, and Mr. Jones helped her cheat!"

Elvin seized on her words as if they were his last lifeline. He strode forward, his chest puffed up with self-righteousness, and thundered, "Mr. Jones, my daughter speaks the truth! In competition, fairness is sacred, especially when the stakes are this high. Ms.Scott used your sword, a custom weapon. That tips the scales. Her victory cannot stand!"

Hannah's gaze darkened as she stared at Vincent's sword in her hand. She quickly assessed the situation.
。
Vincent rose slowly, a storm brewing on his face, his gaze as sharp and merciless as a drawn blade sweeping across Elvin and Lindsay. "And just because you said so, Ms. Scott's victory doesn't count?" The atmosphere thickened, so heavy that it seemed even the air forgot how to breathe.

Elvin, though buckling under the weight of Vincent's formidable presence, stubbornly pressed on. "Using a custom sword is unfair."

Claude, watching closely, furrowed his brows.Though Vincent irritated him, Elvin and Lindsay's refusal to accept defeat left an even more sour taste.

Claude stepped forward, his tone dripping with frost and irony."Mr. Cortez, when you saw Mr. Jones lend his sword to Ms. Scott earlier, you said nothing. Now that she's won, you suddenly raise objections? Isn't your timing just a little too convenient?"

Nikolas seized the chance, savoring the Cortez family's embarrassment. "Exactly-Mr. Hobbes has it right. What's the matter, Mr. Cortez? You can't stomach losing? If the sword was such a problem,why didn't you complain before? Only now you cry foul-sounds like sore losers to me."

Lindsay's face burned red, yet she refused to back down. "I am not a sore loser! This is about fairness.Mr. Jones' sword is custom-made. Of course, it gave Ms. Scott an advantage. Our challenge is perfectly reasonable!"

Hannah studied Lindsay's crimson face, a flicker of impatience flashing in her eyes. There was no point sparring with someone who couldn't accept the simple truth of defeat. "Enough bickering. If you think it unfair, I'll use a standard blade and still defeat you."

Her words struck Lindsay like a slap, leaving her flushed with humiliation.

"Fine!" Lindsay shrieked. "As long as you don't wield that cheating sword and fight fair, I'll acknowledge your win."

Claude cast Vincent a displeased glance and muttered, "Mr. Jones, if you hadn't stepped in and offered your sword, none of this would've unfolded.Sometimes, it's wiser not to interfere-your help may end up causing trouble for her."

It was a veiled warning for Vincent to keep his distance from Hannah.

But Vincent didn't bother with a reply; he simply cut Claude down with a cold, dismissive glance.

Hannah reached for a standard club sword from the rack, preparing to step back onto the field.

But Vincent's hand shot out, stopping her in her tracks."No need."

Puzzled, Hannah frowned. "No need for what?"

Vincent explained calmly, "No need for another round." He turned his gaze on Lindsay and Elvin."Yes, my sword is custom-made-but so is Miss Cortez's, isn't it?"
###Chapter 457 Best of Three


Vincent's words thundered throughout the fencing hall, pulling every gaze straight to the sword in Lindsay's grip.

Only moments earlier, all attention had been fixed entirely on Hannah's sword while Lindsay's went unnoticed.

Lindsay's chest hammered uncontrollably beneath Vincent's unyielding stare. By reflex, she hid the sword behind her back, straining to stay composed."Mr.Jones, what are you implying? This is obviously a normal club-distributed sword."

."Is that so?" Vincent stretched out his palm. "Do you dare let me examine the sword in your grasp?"

Lindsay locked eyes with him, dread flooding her chest. Still, she compelled herself to act bold, her tone sharp."Why... Why wouldn't I dare?" Lindsay clutched at a sliver of hope. Although her father had someone craft the sword for her, its design was strikingly plain, with no visible distinction.She doubted Vincent could detect anything out of it.

With her jaw tightened, Lindsay extended her sword.

Vincent took it, his eyes moving steadily across the steel. His fingertips brushed against an almost invisible spot on the hilt's end. At once, the icy curve of his lips broadened.

Vincent suddenly rotated the hilt, revealing a slot etched with two refined characters-"L.C.", Lindsay's initials. With a mocking chuckle, he tilted the hilt for all to see, his stare cutting deeper. "Miss Cortez, may I ask which club provides a standard sword carved with the initials of your own name?"
。
The spectators burst into shocked cries. The elaborate markings were now unmistakable.

Hannah, off to the side, silently acknowledged Vincent's sharp perception. Lindsay, overcome with unease, swiftly snatched the sword back, sending a pleading glance toward Elvin.

This sword had been slipped to Lindsay by Elvin before the duel. He'd assured her its likeness to a standard blade was perfect, and no trick could be uncovered. Yet here, Vincent had laid it bare before everyone.

Claude studied Lindsay's flustered demeanor coldly,sensing that something was off. She looked unusually shaken.

Elvin's complexion turned pale, perspiration streaking his forehead. He had not expected Vincent to possess such a sharp eye to identify such a hidden feature.

Internally condemning Lindsay's lack of composure,Elvin advanced swiftly, his tone loud as he tried to control the situation. "Ah, Mr. Jones, such sharp sight you possess. I must confess, this was indeed my mistake. I gave this custom-made sword to my daughter earlier. She enjoys using it, so l let her bring it into the bout. I never expected it wwould cause such a misunderstanding."
His voice carried mock regret. "Since both participants fought with custom blades, the initial result is naturally beyond dispute.We yield."

Shifting his approach, he plastered on a smile."Nevertheless, my daughter just battled against Mr.MacLeod's date, and she's clearly drained. Ms. Scott fought only once, so her endurance is much greater.Thus, I suggest a best-of-three contest for fairness.What say you all?"

Lindsay immediately added her agreement. "Exactly!Ms. Scott only fought me once, so she remains full of strength. Two out of three is the most just. She already holds one win, so why hesitate? It's only a few more rounds."

Nikolas, stationed nearby, let out a disdainful laugh.

Hannah reacted to Lindsay's obstinate remarks with a frosty stare. "Shameless."

Claude knit his brow, a strong revulsion rising in him. "Miss Cortez, you have been defeated. Honor your wager and stop pressing the matter."

But Lindsay seemed to have lost all her composure,jabbing a finger toward Hannah and shouting in a piercing voice, "I haven't lost! The rules aren't fixed.Only two out of three is fair. If she declines, it means she's terrified and dreads the prospect of a defeat."

Hannah observed Lindsay's frenzied behavior with mounting annoyance. She answered icily, "You and Aylin settled with a single round. Why should it be two out of three with me? If you fall again, will it extend to three out of five?"

Lindsay screamed, "I don't care! If you refuse another fight, the wager won't count."

At that instant, the club manager strode forward with two uniformed assistants, their demeanor grave,halting behind Vincent with respect.

The manager inclined his head. "MAr. Jones, the personnel you requested have arrived." Vincent calmly lifted his hand in a slight gesture.

The two staff members advanced to retrieve the swords from both Hannah and Lindsay.

"What is this? Mr. Jones, won't you permit us to wield our personal blades?" Lindsay objected at once.

Vincent remained composed yet radiated command."Why the fluster? Didn't you call for fairness? These men are here to verify whether the custom blades satisfy the International Fencing Federation's competition standards."
###Chapter 458 Time To Honor The Wager


Lindsay's and Elvin's faces twisted with more than mere frustration-raw panic seized them.

Lindsay's composure shattered as she lunged forward, yanking her sword from the staff member's grasp. "Don't touch my sword!" she shrieked.

Vincent watched her unravel, a mocking smirk curling his lips. "What's wrong, Miss Cortez? Guilty conscience?"

Lindsay faltered, her lips quivering. "I-I just don't like others touching my things!"

From the sidelines, Hannah watched as Vincent, with just a handful of words, boxed Lindsay and Elvin in.A playful curve played at her lips. Earlier, she'd noticed that after Vincent took Lindsay's sword, he'd whispered something to the club manager. It turned out that his silence hadn't been indecision from weighing Lindsay's unreasonable demand-it was the calm before a devastating strike. This man was merciless, yet his precision was chillingly effective.

Claude's gaze hardened as he watched Lindsay's demeanor crumble. Initially, he'd thought she was just sore about losing, but her guilty expression and Elvin's ashen face told a different story. Lindsay had likely cheated.

A staff member hurried forward, breaking the tension. "Mr. Jones, the sword used by Ms. Scott has been fully tested. It meets all International Fencing Federation standards-weight, balance, elasticity,resilience-all within regulation. No issues at all."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd, their eyes on ·Hannah now filled with respect. She had won fair and square.

Vincent gave a subtle nod, his piercing gaze locking onto Lindsay. "Ms. Scott's victory is legitimate. Miss Cortez, will you hand over the sword for a test now?" Hannah's brows lifted slightly. Vincent's move had validated her ability and affirmed her clear win.

Whispers grew among the club staff.

"Could Miss Cortez actually have cheated?"

"No way-Lindsay Cortez? She's had a record of consecutive wins here."

The murmurs reached Lindsay's ears.

Elvin, seeing the situation spiral beyond salvage,stepped in front of Lindsay, his forced smile pleading."Mr. Jones, let's not take this too far. No need to sour things with the Cortez family-let's keep it amicable for the future."

Vincent's cold smile deepened, unfazed by Elvin's posturing. "Too far? We're just getting started."

With a casual wave, Vincent signaled the waiting staff, who stepped forward and deftly snatched Lindsay's customized sword from her hands. Lindsay stumbled, nearly collapsing as the sword
was taken.

The test results came swiftly.
A staff member approached, face grim. "Mr. Jones,Miss Cortez's sword is severely non-compliant. The balance was altered to enhance thrust speed and stability, and the tip sensor's sensitivity was illegally boosted."

The crowd erupted, their shock and scorn crashing over Lindsay like a tidal wave.

"Lindsay actually cheated! So all her winning streaks were unfair?"

"No wonder Lindsay was so cocky. If this gets out,she is done in the fencing world-she'll be a joke every time she steps onto the piste."

Vincent approached Elvin, his presence looming."This, Mr. Cortez, is what 'too far' looks like."

Elvin swayed, his vision darkening as the weight of ruin settled in. The Cortez family's reputation lay in tatters.
Nikolas finally snapped back to his senses and slapped his thigh, his voice thick with outrage and disdain. "So that's it! I knew something was off! My Aylin didn't lose-Miss Cortez cheated! MAr. Cortez,you and your daughter are despicable, and you had the gall to accuse Ms. Scott of cheating?Shameless!"

Hannah watched the drama unfold, her heart steady and unmoved. She stepped forward, her voice calm but firm. "Then it's settled. I won fair and square."

Turning to Nikolas and Elvin, Hannah continued,"Time to honor the wager, Mr. MacLeod, Mr.Cortez."

Nikolas, despite his loss, was almost gleeful at the Cortez family's disgrace. He immediately replied cheerfully, "Fair enough, Ms. Scott! You're straightforward, and | appreciate that. I, Nikolas MacLeod,can handle a loss."

Nikolas pulled out his phone. "I'll have my assistant draft the contract now. That parcel of land and the building are yours!"
Hannah gave a slight nod. "Appreciate it, Mr.MacLeod." Her gaze shifted to Elvin, pale and shaken, her tone carrying quiet authority. "And Mr.Cortez, regarding the technology patent, we'll formalize it with a contract. The twenty million dollars -will you pay by transfer or check?"
###Chapter 459 Dissolve The Prospective Marriage Alliance
 Elvin appeared visibly shaken. His company, Cortez Tech,was already struggling with financial strain, and there was no possibility he could gather such a massive sum. "Ms. Scott, could you give me a little time to get the money together? Or maybe lessen the figure?"

His words trembled with desperation as he begged Hannah.

Hannah's response was calm and unwavering. "A wager is a wager. There's no justification to cut the amount. I'll grant you extra time, but don't keep me waiting too long."

With that, she gave neither Elvin nor Lindsay another glance and departed with effortless poise.

Vincent instantly stepped forward to pursue her.
Claude observed Lindsay collapsed on the floor and the anguish carved into Elvin's features, his mind reeling. Then, he schooled his expression into one of mock outrage and strode toward them. "Mr. Cortez,Miss Cortez-how could you sink so low? Cheating?Absolutely appalling! I couldn't be more let down by you both!"

Yet, behind the stern rebuke flickered a trace of satisfaction. This disgrace provided Claude the perfect justification to dissolve the prospective marriage alliance.

Grasping the opening, Claude unveiled his real aim."I see no reason for the arrangement for our alliance to continue. I'll speak to my parents about canceling it."

After issuing his denunciation, Claude pivoted, his features swiftly softening into a bright smile as he called toward the way Hannah had gone, "Anna, wait up!"

Lindsay remained on the floor, watching Claude run after Hannah without hesitation. Whatever slim hope she still had was shattered completely. A muffled sob
escaped her throat as tears finally flowed. She had aimed to impress Claude, to prove her value, but everything had collapsed into a humiliating disaster.Now, whatever fragile chance she possessed with Claude had vanished.

Elvin's frustration boiled over. "Why are you crying?We can't allow it to end this way. We must secure your betrothal with Claude!"

Lindsay raised her tear-stained face, her gaze clouded with despair. "Dad, didn't you hear him? He said it's finished. There's no chance left."

But Elvin still clutched his final fragment of hope. He understood that ensuring the betrothal was essential for Cortez Tech's future growth. Today's disgrace had to remain confined to the few who had witnessed it.

Just then, Nikolas-disregarding Aylin at his side-approached with a sneer. "Mr. Cortez, if you're seeking a son-in-law, why not me? I wouldn't object to marrying your daughter."
Nikolas was fresh from his third divorce and old enough to be Lindsay's father. His proposal made Lindsay's stomach churn.

Rather than erupting in fury, Elvin's eyes darted to the club's surveillance cameras, and an idea formed.Without warning, he struck Nikolas with his fist. "You vile bastard! How dare you covet my daughter?"

The two men instantly began wrestling.

Lindsay dashed forward in alarm, trying to separate them.

Aylin, however, stayed still, watching coldly. Nikolas already had her, yet he still pursued other women. He had it coming.

Meanwhile, Hannah moved down the corridor toward the exit, her steps steady and unhurried.

Vincent followed close behind, keeping one pace back. At last, he broke the quiet. "How about sparring with me next time? Just the two of us."

Hannah neither reduced her pace nor turned her
gaze. "No. Sparring has never brought me good memories."

Vincent's tall figure shifted to obstruct her way."What's that supposed to mean?"

Compelled to halt, Hannah answered evenly, "Exactly what it sounds like. I only wanted a little enjoyment and ease this time, but instead, it descended into chaos. What a disappointment!"

Vincent's stare locked onto hers, his throat constricting as he swallowed hard. "And before? Did you truly have no good memories of fencing, even practicing it with me?"

Meeting his eyes directly, without wavering, Hannah answered, "No. Not in the slightest."

Meeting his eyes directly, without wavering, Hannah answered, "No. Not in the slightest."
###Chapter 460 We Will Never Have Children


Vincent surged forward, his voice thick with stubbornness. "No way! I remember-you were always smiling,always so full of joy!"

Flickers of hazy, warm memories flooded Vincent's mind-Hannah's head tilted back, eyes gleaming with light, her lips curved in a dazzling smile. Could all that happiness have been fake?

Hannah remained composed, her tone even. "Back then, I begged you to teach me fencing.If|1pulled a long face, wouldn't that have seemed ungrateful?"

Vincent's pupils contracted sharply, his long-held beliefs suddenly overturned, leaving him momentarily shaken. "You're saying all that joy back then was just an act?"

Hannah gave a slight nod, her voice devoid of warmth. "Pretty much so."

"Why?" Vincent's confusion spilled out. He seized her wrist, his grip tight enough to make her wince."If you weren't happy with practicing fencing with me, why did you keep clinging to me?"

Hannah didn't pull away; she simply met his gaze, her eyes deep and distant, as if seeing through him to the naive,stubborn girl she once was. Her voice softened, almost wistful."Because I loved you then. I wanted to be near you every single day."

The words hit Vincent like a blow to the chest. He saw her again-the girl who'd confessed to him. Once,she had been all sunlight and wild impulse, rushing headlong without a second thought-so different from the woman before him now, composed to the point of coldness.

His voice grew bitter. "If you loved me, shouldn't being with me have made you happy? Why do you say now that you weren't?"

Hannah's gaze lingered on him, a sharp pang of memory slicing through her heart. She looked away, her thoughts drifting. "Chasing you was draining. You were distant, never giving anything back, always leaving me to guess your thoughts. I was exhausted, and faking happiness became a burden. Thinking about it now
still feels heavy."

Self-reproach and regret surged, threatening to engulf Vincent. He released her wrist and stumbled back,his voice rough and fractured. "I'm sorry. I didn't realize."

Hannah shook her head slightly. "It's in the past. We've both moved on with our lives. That's for the bost."

"For the best?" Vincent's head whipped, a spark of defiance in his eyes as he starad at her."Do you rogret it?"

Hannah's brows knitted. "Regret what?"

Vincent's throat tightened as he forced the words out. "Regret chasing me?"

Her eyes met his, clear and unwavering. "I don't regret chasing you."

That was a Chapter of her life, one she'd written with fearless passion.

Vincent's heart gave a sudden jolt. She didn't regret ever chasing after him? Did that mean he still held a place in her heart? A spark of hope flared in his eyes. But her next words snuffed out that fragile hope completely.

Her voice remained steady, but it carried a chilling finality. "But I regret marrying you.If we hadn't married,we wouldn't have spent five years torturing each other."

Vincent's heart froze and then shattered. To her, their five years of marriage had been nothing but torment?He'd clung to the belief that there'd been moments of happiness, lowever fleeting.

A desperate thought struck him-could a child have changed things? He asked, his voice low, "If we'd had a child, would our life together still have been torment?"

At the word "child," Hannah's body stiffened, a fleeting shadow of deep pain crossing her eyes. It vanished quickly, replaced by a colder, resolute detachment. Her lips curved faintly, her gaze unyielding."We will never have children."

She'd lost their first child to a miscarriage, and afterward, her body could no longer carry one. How could they have had a child? Even if they had, she'd never have stayed with him just for a child's sake. "What do you mean?" Vincent frowned, his voice sharp. "No children? You don't want them?"

Before Hannah could respond, a voice interrupted."Anna, what are you two talking about?"

Claude stepped forward, his eyes narrowing at the weight in Vincent's expression as he positioned himself between them.

Hannah snapped back to the present. "It's nothing. Claude, let's go."

Without hesitation, she turned and headed toward the parking lot.

Claude followed close behind.

Vincent reached out instinctively, but his hand grasped only air.

Left alone, he stood in silence until the club manager approached. "Mr. Jones, I've had the customn-made sword wrapped. How should I deliver it to Ms. Scott?"

Vincent's face was bleak. "She's gone. It's too late now."
###Chapter 461 Considering Marriage Alliance


Claude's vehicle advanced evenly along the road. His eyes drifted toward Hannah's faintly pallid outline and the slight tension between her brows, and he could not restrain himself.′′Arnna, what did you talk to Vincent just now? You seem unwell."

Hannah rested deeper into the seat, her expression distant and unfocused as she lost herself in her own thoughts. At his inquiry, she drew herself back, her tone carrying weariness."|′Snothing. Just weighed down by some unwelcome recollections stirred up by the moment."

Claude noticed her unwillingness to elaborate, a darkness flashing in his gaze, though his smile stayed soft.He changed the subject, affecting casualness. "The major issue within the Luminara Group has finally been resolved.What direction will you take next?"

Hannah's eyes regained their sharp discipline. "If the endeavor proceeds as intended, the subsequent stage is naturally to harvest the gains."

Claude laughed lightly and then deliberately shifted the gear. "I mean, aside from business,have you thought about the big milestones in life?"

Hannah hesitated briefly and then shook her head decisively. "I have no so-called big milestones in life.Expanding the Luminara Group is my biggest milestone."

Claude's smile faltered, a flicker of disappointment passing through his eyes. After a pause, he continued,"I understand. I only meant that if Luminara Group seeks even greater advancement, there's another powerful route-a marriage of convenience. Joining forces multiplies progress. What's your view?"

Hannah creased her brows at that remark.′′Amarriage of convenience? I've never given it any thought.If my career ever required marriage as a stepping stone, then I'd be utterly useless."

Her frigid, curt statement struck like a dousing of ice. Claude's grin disappeared, and his features hardened instantly. The car lapsed into silence.

Hannah then recalled Claude's recent blind date-he had been considering a marriage alliance. Realizing her words might have wounded, she softened slightly. After all, Claude was entangled in the turbulence of family power, with scarce autonomy of his own in terms of choosing a partner.

She exhaled, her tone easing. "Claude, I wasn't referring to you. You're burdened by family expectations-|understand."

Claude listened, bitterness swelling, yet he still chose to make it clear to her face. "I will not wed Lindsay Cortez. Her cheating during a fencing match exposes her true character. I'm not so desperate as to marry a woman of that level."

Hannah inclined her head, her words calm. "Yes, marriage is a weighty matter. You should choose wvisely."

"Then will you assist me?" Claude pressed.

Hannah stiffened briefly. "Assist you?"

"Assist me in choosing. I trust your judgment." He revealed his true intention at last.

Hannah sighed inwardly. She disliked being entangled in the Hobbes family's marital plots, yet Claude had offered her much support. With matters spoken this far, she finally agreed. "Alright, I'll come by when I find the chance."

Claude's lips curved into an ambiguous smile. "Then it's agreed."

After dropping Hannah home, Claude drove off as dusk descended.

The instant he crossed his threshold, the cultivated, refined smile vanished utterly, replaced with a chilling,predatory coldness.

He strode swiftly toward the concealed chamber, its walls plastered with images of Hannah. His gaze devoured each picture hungrily, his eyes burning with sickly obsessive desire.

From the moment Hannah escaped from Vincent's grasp, Claude had worn a mask before her-posing as tender, posing as attentive, posing as magnanimous. He had edged closer with careful design, step after
step. He had convinced himself that with enough patience, enough virtue, she would one day acknowledge his devotion-one day/...return his love.

But even after Hannah's separation from Vincent, even with Erica, surgically reshaped to wear Hannah's face, showing up in front of Vincent, Hannah still encountered Vincent-and he still recognized her.

That unseen tether and their tangled history drove Claude into deranged jealousy. Hannah was destined to belong to no one but him. He could no longer endure waiting for her heart to turn naturally. He must act-claim her entirely, whatever it required.



Over the following weeks, Hannah immersed herself in directing the company.

Utilizing the winnings secured from Elvin and Nikolas-the licensing of Cortez Tech's vital patents and suburban estates-she swiftly revived Luminara Group's liquidity and unveiled a new strategic blueprint.

Notably, the expansive immersive production Celestial Voyage, which had dragged on from a lack of funds,leapt forward once new capital flowed in.

Polished character CG, a vast crafted world, inventive gameplay systems-everything signaled its rise as a genre-defining triumph.

Yet, just as the venture neared its last testing stage, on the brink of a major promotional launch, the project leader, Judie Green, stumbled into Hannah's office,her complexion ashen.

Cold sweat streamed down Judie's brow. "Ms. Scott, disaster has struck! The character CGs from our Celestial Voyage venture have been plagiarized!"
###Chapter 462 Being Plagiarized


"Stay calm and tell me slowly. What happened?" Hannah instantly abandoned the task at hand,her demeanor shifting into seriousness.

"Aurora Court Studio just unveiled the first batch of character CGs along with a trailer for their new game,Dustfall Era. The main heroes, environment structures, even the special attacks and effect animations mirror our Celestial Voyage! It's basically a duplicate!" Judie rattled it all out in one breath.

"And because they were ahead, now the entire web claims we copied them! With Celestial Voyage about to debut, I only noticed this now... It was my negligence!" Judie's voice was thick with self-reproach.

Seated behind her broad desk, Hannah tapped her fingertips against the wood, unshaken. "Being copied only proves our strength-strong enough to provoke envy. Since we're the ones being plagiarized, there's nothing to fear."

A fraction of Judie's panic eased, though unease lingered. "But Ms. Scott, the online voices are against us.Aurora Court Studio struck first-how should we respond?"

Hannah leaned into her chair, her gaze unwavering as she resolved her course."Issue the lawyér's notice.Simultaneously, set up a press briefing to reveal our authentic drafts and production records. Let the evidence speak for us."

Seeing Hannah's composed demeanor, Judie felt steadier and nodded quickly. "Yes, Ms. Scott! I'll take care of it right away!"

Judie brushed away perspiration from her brow and hurried out of Hannah's office.

Hannah dug into Aurora Court Studio's background and uncovered that the studio was actually a branch beneath the Jones Group. She pondered-Vincent was never the type to tolerate plagiarism among his subordinates. The real question was-who had leaked the core design drafts of Luminara Group's Celestial Voyage project?

******

Over at Aurora Court Studio-under the Jones Group yet operating independently in another office tower-the mood was celebratory.

Erica sat within her office, watching skyrocketing views and downloads of the Dustfall Era trailer on her computer screen, along with the tidal wave of online accusations that "Luminara Group plagiarized."

A frigid, victorious grin curved her mouth. She raised her coffee and drank with poise.

The last time at the Jones family estate, she had changed her mind. Instead of choosing to be an overlooked designer at the Jones Group's headquarters, she used one remark from Sharon to grab the role of head at an independent studio under the Jones umbrella. Only in this position could she claim a grander platform to flaunt her"brilliance."

Most of all, she knew Hannah was driven and relentless, a woman of ambition. To win Vincent's recognition,she had to mirror Hannah perfectly and accumulate victories. Getting too close to Vincent would simply expose her flaws and stir Vincent's suspicion and annoyance.

She understood that she needed to clash in the corporate arena as Hannah would-by proving herself through outcomes. Yet, she lacked interest in truly developing a game. She sought shortcuts-something to hook Vincent's attention fast. Thus, she chose the simplest path-plagiarism.

Since Celestial Voyage already commanded industry praise, she had paid heavily to have the project's core design drafts stolen from Luminara Group-then instructed her crew to duplicate them outright.

To seize momentum, she'd driven her team into nonstop work, forced an early preview, and immediately hired online agitators to reverse the story-accusing Luminara Group of theft.

"Ma'am!" Her assistant rushed in, brimming with excitement. "Public opinion is fully on our side-everyone's hammering Luminara Group for copying us! But they've just released their design draft timeline, so we must counter quickly."

Erica's grin wavered and then settled as her eyes glinted with scorn and cruelty. "Keep funding the trolls-let them shred Luminara Group apart. Claim the draft record is forged to deceive. We released first, so we own the narrative. Stick to our claims and make them convincing.Got it?" Overwhelmed by her harsh aura, the assistant nodded vigorously."Got it!"

After the assistant left, Erica's smug smile crept back onto her face. She lifted her phone, hunger and ambition flashing as she observed the soaring download numbers. Downloads had already broken the ten-million mark. Perfect. Soon, Vincent would witness her achievement.

Just then, his call appeared on her screen.
###Chapter 463 Valued Her Quite A Bit


Erica's heart soared with elation. Vincent had called her-surely a sign he'd noticed Dustfall Era's dazzling success. She took a deep breath, tamping down her excitement, and answered in a measured tone,mimicking Hannah's cool professionalism, "Mr. Jones, how can l assist you?"

But Vincent's voice cut through, flat and devoid of warmth. "What's this about plagiarism?"

Erica's smile vanished. He wasn't calling to praise her but to confront her? Swallowing her panic and the sting of disappointment, she forced calm into her voice. "Mr. Jones, you've got it wrong. The Luminara Group copied us. Check online-public sentiment is firmly behind Aurora Court Studio."

She shifted the subject and hurried to claim credit. "And our game's downloads have surpassed ten million!"She held her breath, craving words of approval from Vincent-"Good job."

But Vincent offered no praise. His tone was glacial. "They've published their timeline, and it predates yours.Why are you still so sure they copied you?"

Erica's chest tightened. She hadn't expected Vincent to dismiss her"achievementsS11outright. Clenching her jaw, she pushed back. "Timelines can be forged. They're just trying to mislead everyone."

Silence stretched on the other end,each second amplifying her unease.

After an agonizing pause, Vincent spoke again, his voice clipped. "I'll handle this. Stay out of it."

"Mr. Jones, we're in the right here. You don't need to get involved personally," Erica protested, but the line went dead before she could say more.

Erica's brow furrowed. Vincent had said he'd handle it... She couldn't let him dig deeper. If he did, he might uncover that Aurora Court Studio was the plagiarist. No, she couldn't let that happen. She had to act first and stay one step ahead. Vincent hung up, his expression cold and unreadable. His gaze fell on the Dustfall Era plagiarism brief on his desk, a sharp glint flickering in his eyes. He picked up his phone and dialed Hannah.

The call connected almost instantly.

"Hello?" Hannah's voice was cool, stripped of any emotion.

Vincent leaned back in his chair. "MAs. Scott, what's your take on this plagiarism issue?"

A brief pause followed.

Hannah's reply was pointed. "Luminara Group's chain of evidence is solid. Clearly, your Aurora Court Studio is the one that plagiarized us."

Vincent's lips twitched into a faint, wry smile."You should know, the head of Aurora Court Studio is that impostor wearing your face."

A trace of surprise crept into Hannah's voice. "So that's how it is. Seems you value her quite a bit."

Vincent caught the bite of sarcasm, his gaze darkening as he rushed to explain,"It was my grandmother's doing. My grandmother mistook her for you and handed her the studio lead role. I only found out recently."

Hannah's tone turned razor-sharp. "Fine. I'll be blunt. Aurora Court Studio, under Jones Group, blatantly copied Luminara Group's designs. What do you plan to do about it?"

Vincent's eyes narrowed, his voice steady but firm. "We acknowledge the plagiarism. Full compensation wil be provided. Let's set a time to discuss. Jones Group will deliver a esolution to your satisfaction."

Celestial Voyage was a project Hannah held dear. Vincent assumed she'd handle the matter herself.

But Hannah's voice remained detached, professional. "I'm busy. My project lead, Judie, will handle it. That's all.Goodbye."

The call ended abruptly.

Vincent didn't lose his temper. He refused to believe Hannah wouldn't show up.

The next afternoon, Vincent sat in the private room of the city's

###Chapter 464 Because You're Avoiding Me


"Good afternoon, Mr. Jones." Judie lowered herself into the chair with a touch of unease, her expression marked by deliberate professionalism.

Vincent's eyes carried an edge, his tone flat and unreadable. "Where is Ms. Scott?"

Judie hurriedly responded, "Ms. Scott was suddenly called into an overseas video meeting and couldn't leave, so she instructed me to negotiate the plagiarism settlement in her place with full authority."

Her voice carried sincerity, hoping to lessen his suspicion.

Vincent offered no immediate reply. He merely raised his coffee cup and drank slowly. His attention shifted toward Judie's phone resting on the table-the lit screen revealed a live call in progress. Comprehension dawned instantly.

Rather than confront her, he altered course. "Is that so? Since Ms. Scott is unavailable, I've changed my mind. Name your price. Aurora Court Studio, operating under the Jones Group, plagiarized first, so we're prepared to purchase every design right of the Celestial Voyage project with a generous premium." His words struck firmly.

Judie froze, startled by the abrupt proposal. "Acquire it? Mr. Jones, we... Should this talk be about compensation?" Her eyes flicked toward the phone instinctively.

Inside a vehicle parked below, Hannah listened through the line, her brows pressed tightly together. WNhat game was Vincent playing?

Vincent studied Judie's startled face. "Compensation? Your Luminara Group does not seem sincere about the talk over the compensation. Brushing me off with just a project lead? Naturally, I've changed my mind.Jones Group is capable of buying out the design outright."

Then, his tone firm, he added, "The Jones Group is ready to offer five hundred million dolars-but only if Luminara Group makes a public statement about plagiarizing Aurora Court Studio and permanently scrapping the Celestial Voyage project." His terms were brutally harsh.

"Impossible!" Judie burst out, color rising in her cheeks. His terms were blatant distortion of the real situation-utterly intolerable.

Judie's voice rose with urgency. "Mr. Jones, Aurora Court Studio copied us. Coming here to negotiate compensation is already the height of sincerity. How could you..."

Vincent cut her short with a raised hand, his presence pressing hard. "Then have Ms. Scott come talk to me herself. With her, I'll discuss compensation. But with you, I only discuss a buyout." His brows drew tight."You should know that Jones Group holds the power to erase Celestial Voyage."

Judie's expression grew grim, her breath quickened. "Ms. Scott is genuinely tied up!"

Vincent's gaze drifted back toward Judie's phone, his awareness unshaken. "Tied up? Hasn't she been on the line with you this whole time? Tell her to come up."

Judie's complexion went pale. Finally, she lifted the phone with reluctant hands, her voice weary as she spoke into the line. "Ms. Scott, Mr. Jones insists on speaking with you..."

"I heard everything. I'll be there." Hannah's steady, cool voice flowed through the line.

Moments later, the door to the private room opened.

Hannah appeared in a crisp business suit, each step measured and unwavering. Her features revealed nothing,as though this were merely another routine negotiation.

Hannah walked directly to the table. Judie quickly rose, yielding the central seat with deference and moving to the chair beside her.

Hannah settled and met Vincent's eyes, her voice even. "Mr. Jones, you acknowledged the plagiarism already.Why, once my delegate arrived, did you change your mind and offer such unreasonable terms?"

Seeing her finally before him, a faint curve touched Vincent's lips. He leaned back casually, posture loosening. "Because you're avoiding me."

Hannah stiffened, a frown creasing her brow. "Avoiding you?"
Vincent's stare locked on hers, his tone unwavering."After the fencing incident,I invited you several times,and you always claimed to be occupied. This time, I asked for you directly, yet you dispatched another. If that isn't avoidance,what is?"

Hannah held his look without flinching, responding evenly, "I truly am occupied. Surely, Mr. Jones, you're aware of Luminara Group's current challenges."

Vincent leaned forward slightly, persistence steady in his gaze. "I know, which is why the instant the plagiarism issue surfaced, I reached out to you personally and chose to trust you. Yet, you kept avoiding me -that isn't fair."

Judie's heart tumbled like turbulent seas. She lowered her eyes, trying to vanish, wishing she could dissolve into the background. This resembled no negotiation at all. It felt like a raw quarrel between lovers.

Hannah clearly recognized the drift and reined it back. Drawing a deep breath, she returned to the matter at hand. "Regarding the plagiarism, Mr. Jones, what resolution do you propose?"

Vincent noted her redirection and allowed it, his tone reverting to formal. "Straightforward. Aurora Court Studio will release an official confession of plagiarism, deliver a public apology, and permanently withdraw Dustfall Era. On top of that, the Jones Group will compensate the Luminara Group one billion dollars. Does that satisfy you?"

Hannah's brow arched-why did that phrasing sound so strangely familiar?
###Chapter 465 Very Much Alike


The compensation amount was staggering, far beyond industry norms-almost unthinkable.

Judie, listening nearby, caught her breath sharply.

A flicker of surprise crossed Hannah's eyes, but she swiftly masked it with her usual calm. She met Vincent's gaze, her tone steady. "Mr. Jones, you're quite generous."

Vincent seemed to miss the subtle undercurrent in her words. He reached for the serving spoon and deftly placed a piece of fish on Hannah's plate. "Try the fish. I remember it's your favorite," he said with quiet sincerity.

Hannah looked up, a complex emotion flickering in her eyes. "You still remember that?"

Vincent's gaze held hers, unwavering and intense. "Yeah. I have ordered your favorite dishes beforehand,including your beloved crab soup."

Judie felt the air grow heavy, barely daring to breathe.

Hannah stared at the fish on her plate and then at Vincent's piercing, earnest eyes, a wave of unspoken feelings rising within her. After a moment's pause, she spoke softly. "You don't have to do this."

Vincent's resolve didn't waver. "But I want to."

A fragile,weighty silence settled over the room.

Just then, Judie's phone lit up on the table. A new message appeared. "Are you Judie Green? I heard you're the lead on Celestial Voyage. I'mn the head of Aurora Court Studio. Can we meet to discuss the plagiarism issue?"

Judie passed the phone to Hannah. "Ms. Scott, look! Aurora Court Studio's lead reached out to me!"

Hannah took the phone and scanned the message. She tilted the screen toward Vincent across the table."Mr. Jones, your Aurora Court Studio head moves fast. The plagiarism issue is still unresolved, yet she's
eager to meet my project lead. She's clearly up to something. What do you think she wants with Judie at a time like this?"

Vincent glanced at the screen, his expression steady. He lifted his coffee cup, took a slow sip, and said evenly, "I don't care about her."

Hannah raised a brow, her tone teasing. "Oh? Not even a little curious, Mr. Jones? She's parading around with a face strikingly similar to mine. If she pulls something that tarnishes the Jones Group's reputation, you still wouldn't care?"

Vincent set down his cup, a faint, amused glint in his eyes as he studied Hannah. "It seems you're quite interested."

Hannah didn't deny it. "I am. Very." She was intrigued by the woman wearing her face-and even more by the schemes behind reaching out to Judie.

Leaning forward slightly, Hannah proposed, "Mr. Jones, care to step aside with me? I want to hear what she has to say to Judie."

Vincent didn't hesitate. "Happy to oblige."

Turning to Judie, Hannah instructed, "Set the meeting here. Mr. Jones and I will be behind a screen. Just talk to her as you normally would-act natural, like we're not here. Got it?"

Judie caught on quickly, nodding eagerly. "Yes, Ms. Scott!"

Judie grabbed her phone and typed a swift reply to the message.

Hannah leaned closer to Judie, her voice dropping to a serious whisper.′′One more thing-the person you'll meet might look very much like me. Be prepared. Don't show surprise. Just stay composed. Understand?"

Judie blinked, puzzled by the warning, but nodded firmly."Uh, okay! Don't worry, Ms. Scott, I'Hl keep my cool!"

Her curiosity was piqued. Very much alike? How close could the resemblance be? Twins,maybe?

Half an hour later, Erica strode into the private room.
Judie's eyes widened, her breath catching as she nearly gasped aloud. This woman looked exactly like Hannah!Hello, I'm Hannah Scott, head of Aurora Court Studio," Erica said.

Judie recoiled, stunned. Not only did this woman share Hannah's face, but she'd claimed her name too!What was going on?

###Chapter 466 One Hundred Million Dollars


Erica's gaze drifted toward the untouched plates before she inquired,′′Ms. Green, were you expecting company here?"

Judie fought to maintain her composure while facing the woman seated opposite her-someone carrying the exact features of the CEO. She replied evenly, "Yes, I met a friend here for a brief discussion. When you contacted me, I had just concluded the meeting and thus gave you this location."

Erica responded with a practiced smile, "I see, Ms. Green. Shall we move to another table and order some fresh dishes? We can talk over dinner-my treat."

Judie dismissed the suggestion with a swift hand motion. "There's no need for that. Let's keep to the point.Why the sudden desire for a talk? At such a sensitive time, isn't it inappropriate for our two companies to meet in private?"

The faint curve of Erica's lips briefly wavered before settling once more. "That's a fair point, Ms. Green-perhaps it wasn't the most prudent choice. But I requested this meeting specifically to address the plagiarism issue. Online chatter is overwhelmingly accusing Luminara Group of imitating our Aurora Court Studio, and momentum appears to.be tipping toward our side."

Judie held her eyes without flinching. "Luminara Group has promptly released a formal statement and presented the original design timeline. Public opinion is still split. Eventually, the truth will come out."

Erica chuckled, her expression sharpening with intrigue. "Truly admirable, Ms. Green. Your swift counter and sharp mind are impressive. Your elevating the Celestial Voyage initiative to its current stage couldn't have been easy." She smoothly changed the subject. "Interested in working with me?"

Judie responded with well-placed surprise, "Oh? So you're trying to poach me?"

Judie raised her voice deliberately so the listeners behind the screen would catch every syllable.

Behind the screen, Hannah and Vincent locked eyes, clearly startled. Just a poaching attempt? Could it Before Erica could reply, Judie sat up straight."|appreciate the offer, but Luminara Group's been good to me. Our CEO gave me a chance to prove my worth, and I'm not about to leave. Regarding Aurora Court Studio-the copying is obvious. You should pull the game offline, issue a public apology, and restore the Jones Group's reputation."

Erica blinked, briefly thrown off by her sudden show of loyalty and sharp retort, and then released a low,unreadable laugh. "Heh... Ms. Green, there's no need to get worked up. I never said I wanted to bring you onto the Aurora Court Studio."

She reclined slowly, her eyes calculating. "The collaboration I'm suggesting is something else entirely."

Judie's brow twitched, uncertain. "Something else? What doyou mean?"

Erica began lightly tapping the surface of the table with her fingernail. "I'm offering one hundred million dollars."

Judie naturally assumed the sum was meant to settle the intellectual theft dispute and gave a quick laugh."One hundred million as compensation? MMs. Scott, you can't be serious. The damages Luminara Group has taken from Aurora Court Studio's plagiarism go well beyond that figure. A hundred million won't even begin to cover it."

Erica's lips lifted into a cool, enigmatic smirk. "That amount isn't intended for your company."

Judie's confusion only deepened. "Not for Luminara Group? Therwho is it meant for? Don't tell me you're planning to spend that on bots and internet trolls. So this isn't about hiring me or negotiating terms-you're just here to corner us into submission?"

Judie kept Hannah's instructions in mind, steering the conversation step by step.

"Ms. Green, you do have quite the imagination." Erica dropped the pretense, her tone dropping to an icy directness. "I'll be blunt-this hundred million is meant for you."

From behind the screen, Hannah and Vincent grasped her true intention instantly-she was attempting to buy off Judie and make her the scapegoat. Judie stared at her, stunned. "For me? You're offering a bribe?"

Erica studied her reaction with evident satisfaction. "That's correct. One nod from you and the money's yours."

"You're bribing me-what exactly are you asking in return?" Judie pressed.

Erica leaned forward slightly, her tone level and unhurried. "It's simple. You say you led your team to plagiarize Aurora Court Studio's Dustfall Era. You admit that Luminara Group deliberately cloned the product to dominate the market. Then you make a public apology and leave your post. That will close the Chapter.That way, Luminara Group keeps some credibility, and you walk away with a fortune. Not a bad deal, right?"
###Chapter 467 Exposed


Judie suppressed her shock and fury, fighting to project an air of calm. She drew a deep breath and remarked, "You just said public opinion is on Aurora Court Studio's side. So why are you in such a rush,offering a hundred million to bribe me into being the scapegoat of the plagiarism?"

Erica's smile was assured, laced with arrogance, as if she held all the cards. "Naturally, it's to eliminate any risks. Ms. Green, you must realize-Aurora Court Studio is backed by the Jones Group. A hundred million is trivial to me. Take it, and you'll live comfortably forever. It's worth thinking about."

Erica paused, gauging Judie's reaction, and then continued, "And if you're concerned about your career-worried that taking the blame might make future jobs impossible-l assure you, Jones Group will hire you. As the future Mrs. Jones, I give you my word."

"Future Mrs. Jones?" Judie's eyes widened in disbelief, her voice pitching up in astonishment. "You and MMr.Jones..."

Erica's smile widened, her confidence unwavering. "Yes. Mr. Jones and I are deeply in love, and our relationship is solid. Marriage is on the horizon."

Erica raised her chin, as if already embodying the role of Jones family matriarch.

Judie's eyes flicked involuntarily toward the screen in the room's corner.

Just then, a slight sound came from behind the screen.

Moments later, Vincent's imposing figure stepped out. His expression was neutral, but his cold gaze swept over Erica. "You and I are in love? Odd-I don't even know I harbor any romantic feelings toward you."

Erica's smile shattered. Why was Vincent here? Had he overheard everything? Her face drained of color,her body quaking.

As Erica's mind raced for an escape, Hannah appeared from behind the screen, her steps measured,coming to stand silently beside Vincent. Her eyes locked onto Erica's face-uncannily identical to her own. "Hannah... Hannah Scott?" Erica gasped in alarm. Hannah and Vincent? When had they gotten on well? Why were they here together? So they had heard every word just now?

Suddenly, it clicked for Erica-no wonder Judie's gaze had kept darting around. This was an elaborate trap.

Panic clawed at Erica, but she forced a facade of composure, clinging to her remaining poise. Still, her trembling persisted, her teeth clattering faintly.

Judie sprang to her feet at Hannah's arrival, offering a respectful nod."Ms.Scott!"

Erica's breath caught. Judie had displayed such reverence for Hannah as one would for the company's CEO.What was happening? Wasn't Hannah merely a low-level employee at Luminara Group? Why the profound respect from Judie?

In seconds, Erica's world had upended, her mind reeling.

Hannah acknowledged Judie with a subtle nod, her focus fixed on Erica. She approached slowly, the air thickening with tension. "So you recognize me. Who are you, really? Why impersonate me?"

Erica's skin prickled under Hannah's intense scrutiny. In her panic, one instinct dominated-flee! She spun toward the door, poised to run.

But Vincent's broad form blocked her way, his cold stare emanating an oppressive chill.

Hannah's lips twisted into a mocking smile as she watched Erica. "What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?Just want to flee?"

Erica knew she was utterly exposed. Suddenly, desperation sparked an idea. She snapped her head up to Vincent, her voice cracking with tears and accusation.′′Vncent, have you forgotten? I risked everything to save you when you fell into the water at seven. Without my brother and father, would you even be alive? Are you really that ungrateful?"

Vincent's brow furrowed. How did she know about his childhood accident-the fall into the water at seven,a closely guarded secret? Only a handful knew the details.
###Chapter 468 Deduced The Truth


Erica raised the issue concerning Brinley, firmly convinced that Vincent would be stunned.

During his brief lapse in focus, Erica's eyes glimmered with resolve. She suddenly veered aside, attempting to escape through the gap beside Vincent.

Yet, Hannah and Judie moved instantly, nearly in unison. Hannah seized Erica's wrist, while Judie swiftly barred the entrance.

"Don't imagine you can flee without clarifying your identity!" Hannah's tone was frosted steel, her hold rigid and relentless as she restrained Erica, who fought to wrench free.

Being halted, Erica recognized thatforcing her path was futile. Her features darkened with vexation and fury. She snapped her gaze at Vincent. "Just ask Vincent! No one understands who I am more than he does!"

Hannah's stare shot toward Vincent, seeking confirmation.

Vincent's look was layered; he inclined his head slightly and spoke in a grave timbre. "Yes."

With Vincent's affirmation, Hannah's grasp instinctively slackened momentarily.

Erica swiftly tore herself loose, slipped around Judie, and bolted out without glancing back.

Inside the private room, Hannah furrowed her brow deeply and questioned Vincent, "So who is she?"

Vincent walked over to her, his eyes solemn and intent. "She claims to be Brinley."

"Brinley?" Hannah's pupils tightened sharply, her expression laden with shock and disbelief. "That's impossible! Was she released from an international high-security prison already?"

Vincent shook his head, gaze cutting. "Nah. I confirmed recently. Brinley remains inside and never escaped." Hannah's confusion deepened, her tone edged with rising ire. "Then why didn't you question that woman just now? I wouldn't have released her if I had known you were uncertain about her identity."

Vincent appeared lost in his thoughts. "Because it's strange. Apart from Brinley herself, only select members of the Jones family know about the accident when I nearly drowned at seven. Later on, I only shared it with you."

Hannah instantly perceived his implication, her chest sinking. "You mean you suspect she belongs to the Jones family?"

Vincent's eyes were icy as he inclined his head slowly. "Yes. I've narrowed it. Few know this, and none raise suspicion. Except..."

Their gazes locked, and they muttered the name together, "Erica?"

Vincent was faintly startled that Hannah matched his reasoning. He pressed forward, his voice weighted and forceful. "Exactly. That day, Erica charged into the fire, seemingly seeking to end her own life, but the corpse in question was charred beyond recognition in the blaze, leaving her face unverifiable. Therefore, it's reasonable to suspect that Erica hadn't actually died, instead altering her features to approach me."

Hatred filled Hannah's eyes, her body quivering with fervent rage. "I'll hunt her down, rip away her false face, and avenge my father myself!"

She pivoted, rushing for the exit.

"Hold on." Vincent, swift and alert, caught her arm. "Restrain yourself! We lack definite proof. If you act now,she'll be alerted! We must wait, gather evidence she is Erica, and then bring her to justice."

"I won't wait!" Hannah thrashed violently. "Erica took my father's life with her vicious plots, and I'll see her pay in blood!"

She was too agitated. Vincent held her tightly, lowering his chin atop her head and pledging earnestly. "I know your grief! Trust me, I won't let you wait long! She will face the music."

Gradually, Hannah's struggle eased within his embrace. Her ragged breaths steadied, and the vicious hatred in her eyes was forcefully contained, yielding to a colder resolve. Yes, Vincent was correct. Without proof, reckless action would only ruin everything. She had to maintain control and stay composed!

Drawing a long breath, her tone steadied. "Release me.I'm leaving."

Vincent sensed her shift, easing slightly, and released her.

Not sparing him a look, Hannah adjusted her collar and strode out of the room.

Vincent trailed her soundlessly.

Judie, having wisely stayed by the door during their exchange, quickly inclined respectfully as they exited."Ms. Scott,Mr. Jones."

Hannah gave a small nod. "Thank you for assisting. You may leave now."

Judie brightened with relief, replying swiftly, "Yes, Ms. Scott!"

Judie departed in haste, silently reflecting, Today's ordeal was truly astonishing.

In the parking lot, Hannah walked to her vehicle, opened the door, and settled in the driver's seat. She had just buckled her belt when a light knock sounded on the glass.

Vincent stood beside her car, bending slightly, peering in at her through the pane. His tone was deep."Shall I drive instead?"

Hannah refused to glance at him, eyes locked forward, voice leveled. "I'll manage."

Vincent answered, "Very well."

Despite his words, he made no movement to depart.
###Chapter 469 An Unexpected Encounter


Vincent stood beside Hannah's car, his tall frame casting a stark shadow under the parking lot's dim lights.He leaned closer, peering through the window with concern. "You're not in any shape to drive. Let me take the wheel."

Hannah drew a steadying breath, swallowing her irritation, and glanced at the sleek black Bentley parked nearby. "I saw your car,"she said pointedly, the implication clear: if Vincent drove her car, what about his own?

"I'll have Derek handle it," Vincent replied with an immediate solution.

Hannah's grip tightened on the steering wheel, while Vincent stood resolute, waiting patiently by her car.

They were locked in a silent standoff.

Just then, a white SUV circled the lot several times before pulling to a stop in the lane behind Hannah's car.

The window rolled down, revealing a young man's exasperated face-Edgar Newman. HHe muttered to the passenger seat, "Is that car even going to move? We've been waiting forever! I'm starving-when can we finally get to eat?"

He slapped the steering wheel in frustration.

Marilyn Jensen, in the passenger seat, leaned out with a weary expression. "What a day. Not a single open spot in this entire lot!"

After a few more minutes with no movement from Hannah's car, Edgar's patience snapped. He flung his door open and stormed over, barking,"Hey! You moving this thing or what? You've been parked here forever -get going!"

Marilyn scrambled out after him, intending to rein in his temper, but her eyes caught the tall, striking man beside the car. Her gaze lingered, captivated. So handsome! Her attention wavered as she stole another glance. Hannah, already seething with pent-up anger and hurt, was ignited by Edgar's brash words. She threw her car door open with a sharp jerk and snapped, "I parked here, and I'll stay as long as I want! Who are you to order me around?"

Vincent stood quietly, making no move to intervene. He knew Hannah didn't need soothing-she needed to unleash. All that bottled-up rage and pain demanded an outlet.

Edgar let out a dry laugh, sizing Hannah up. Her beauty struck him, but his words stayed sharp."You're easy on the eyes, but that attitude... I've been watching-you act like you're about to leave but just sit there,wasting everyone's time. You're the problem here."

His eyes flicked to Vincent, whose silent authority was unmistakable, and he smirked derisively."Oh,1get it.Lovers' spat? She won't let you in the car? How juvenile. Come on, we're adults-can't you act a little more mature?"

"We're not a couple!" Hannah shot back, her voice cutting like a blade. "If you want to argue, argue with me -leave him out of it."

Edgar faltered, caught off guard by her fierce retort, and was about to snap back when Marilyn's eyes widened, staring at Hannah with sudden recognition. "Wait! Are you Victoria?"

Hannah's anger subsided, replaced by confusion. "You know me?"

Marilyn clapped her hands, her face alight with excitement. "It is you! Don't you remember? Six months ago in Cavendria, near Queen's Avenue, I was mugged by some thugs, and you stepped in to help! You even called the police and gave me your business card, saying I could reach out if I ever needed anything. I never imagined we'd run into each other here-what a small world!"

Hannah's brow furrowed, her tone apologetic. "I'm terrible with faces. It's not ringing a bell."

Marilyn waved it off, her smile radiant. "No problem at all! I'm so grateful for what you did that day. Letme treat you to dinner!"

Edgar sighed, exasperated. "Great, but there's no parking-how are we supposed to eat?"

Marilyn nudged him with a playful grin and said to Hannah,"Oh, right! This is Edgar, my kept man. Don't
mind his words!"

Edgar shrugged and gazed at Hannah. "Sorry about earlier."

The encounter diffused Hannah's anger, and a sudden idea sparked in her mind.
###Chapter 470 Time For A Kiss


Hannah glanced at Marilyn and said, "No offense taken. No need for dinner. How about a drink instead?"

"A drink? Absolutely!" Marilyn's face lit up with enthusiasm. "There's a great bar nearby with an awesome vibe. Let me take you!"

Vincent and Edgar exchanged startled looks.How had a casual chat suddenly turned into plans for drinks?

Ignoring Vincent, Hannah strode to the driver's seat, pulled out her keys, and pressed.them into his hand."You said you'd drive my car? Take it back for me. I'll get a cab later."

Vincent's face darkened. She wasn't planning to take him with her?

Without waiting,Hannah turned to Marilyn. "Let's go."

Marilyn linked arms with Hannah, beaming, and then spun back to plant a playful kiss on Edgar's cheek."Sorry, honey, you're on your own today-go find something to do!"

Edgar frowned. "You're leaving me out?"

Marilyn laughed. "Girls' night-no guys allowed."

Edgar sighed and asked, "Want me to pick you up later?"

Marilyn shook her head, grinning. "No need, and don't bother showing up."

"Fine," Edgar muttered, knowing his place, and didn't push further.

Edgar turned to Vincent with a cheeky grin, leaning in to whisper, "So, you're really not with that stunner?What's the deal-her kept man? Man, with a face like yours, how much do you rake in daily? Come on. Give me a number."

Vincent didn't spare Edgar a glance, his eyes locked on Hannah's retreating figure. Without a word, he strode  after her. a hint of his pay? Guess upfront guys like me are rare in this game."

Shaking his head, he returned to his car and drove off to pass the time.



Vincent followed Hannah and Marilyn to the bar, choosing a discreet booth with a clear view of them. He sat,his gaze fixed on Hannah, ready to whisk her away the moment she had too much to drink.

Suddenly, his phone buzzed. It was an urgent work call about a critical document. Frowning, he skimmed through it.

Meanwhile, Marilyn, after brief introductions, decided to liven things up by boldly hiring two tall, striking escorts. One slid in beside her, while the other was ushered to Hannah's side.

Hannah knocked back drink after drink.

Marilyn,noticing Hannah's silent brooding, tugged at her arm."Why just drink? Rough day?"

Hannah met Marilyn's eyes through a foggy haze, a bitter smile flickering. "Yeah, I'm pissed. My enemy's right in front of me, and I can't touch her yet."

Marilyn sighed, seeing the pain in·Hannah's eyes. She patted Hannah's shoulder, flashing a carefree grin."Then stop stewing. Life's too short-have fun while it lasts!" She pointed to the escort beside Hannah,his rugged charmn edged with danger, and smirked. "Look, I got you a gashing escort. Go have some fun!"

Hannah followed Marilyn's gesture, eyeing the suited escort beside her.

He'd been watching her, and when their eyes met, he flashed a smile-half-predatory, half-charming. His voice was smooth, low. "Hey, beautiful, want to have some fun?"

He grabbed the bottle, refilling her empty glass.

Hannah tilted her head, a playful smile curling her lips. "What kind of fun are we talking?"

"For every drink you take, I lose a piece of clothing," he said, handing her the glass.Instead of taking the glass, Hannah leaned in, took a sip from the glass in his clutch, and raised a brow."Sounds intriguing."

After several rounds, the escort was shirtless, his toned frame on display.

"Not bad," Hannah remarked with seriousness. Her gaze drifted to Marilyn, now locked in a passionate kiss with her escort, utterly lost in the moment.

Hannah set her glass down, leaned close to her escort, and purred,"So, isn't it time for a kiss?"

Her body angled toward him, but her eyes flicked toward Vincent's booth. She knew he was there too.
###Chapter 471 Compensate You


Hannah advanced boldly, slipping her arm firmly across the male escort's shoulder. Her mouth opened faintly, prepared to press a kiss upon the male escort.

Right as their mouths nearly touched, a hand darted forward, seizing Hannah's wrist with force. At the same time, another arm locked around her waist, dragging her violently aside.

Hannah gasped, her frame jerked suddenly away from the male escort, colliding into a sturdy and unmistakable chest. She instantly recognized Vincent.

Vincent's expression was grim and menacing, exuding a frozen menace.

Hannah seemed to regain a flicker of composure, irritation flaring at the interruption. She writhed faintly,muttering, "Why are you here?"

Vincent's arm clamped tighter around her waist. She actually questioned his presence? Heaven alone knew his pulse nearly halted when he witnessed that scene-their lips almost connecting.

Vincent's frosty eyes cut toward the male escort, brimming with naked hostility and threat.

The male escort trembled under that stare, retreating instinctively, not daring to step forward.

Vincent redirected his gaze, fastening on Hannah, who still tried wrenching free from his hold. "Weren't you supposed to be drinking? Why are you flirting with men?"

Hannah deflected the conversation. "You scared away my man! Compensate me for that!"

"Compensate you?" Vincent choked back his fury,leaning in, his striking features brushing near, his heated breath grazing her skin. "Fine, I'll compensate you!"

Before his words sank in, he dropped his head, capturing her slightly parted lips.

After a heartbeat of shock, Hannah yielded, answering the kiss with reckless hunger and unrestrained fire.
<Chaptor 471 Compansato You	·120 Paintz a nosi
Her eager response instantly fanned Vincent's craving further. Their mouths locked with greater urgency and force.

As their breathing tangled in disorder, Hannah gasped, her searing lips grazing Vincent's ear. Her breath was tinged with alcohol. "Want to have sex?"

That brazen invitation snapped the last shred of Vincent's restraint. His eyes darkened with intense desire,his Adam's apple moving vigorously. With a guttural sound, he roughly lifted her into his arms, striding toward the nearest hotel to secure a presidential suite.

They wasted not a moment; the door slammed, their bodies entwined in frenzy.

Hannah acted with startling initiative, nearly feral in her urgency, clawing his back with sharp nails. Her voice whispered again and again, "Faster, faster."

Vincent answered every demand with full strength.

Amid the intoxicating pleasure, a flicker of suspicion pierced his mind-she didn't appear to be indulging in the pleasure of their intimacy, but rather to bury some unspoken burden.

At dawn, Vincent rested sideways, propping his head with one arm, watching Hannah's sleeping form beside him.

"Stop staring at me." Hannah's groggy tone broke the silence, her eyes still closed.

Vincent's mouth curved faintly. "When did you wake?"

Hannah's eyes slowly opened, their clarity evident."Just now."

Vincent's brow arched with quiet amusement. "Just woke up? Then how did you know I'd been staring?"

Hannah gave no reply and only cast him a look before rolling away, her back to him.

Vincent's gaze dimmed faintly. He slid his arm over her shoulder from behind, placing a soft yet possessive kiss there. His tone dropped low, laced with temptation and probing. "Want another round?"

Hannah's figure stiffened slightly. She didn't  turn back. Her words were steady yet coldly detached."About last night..."

Vincent's arm tightened, pulling her closer, his chin resting atop her hair. "Last night, you took the initiative;you need to own up to last night."

Hannah abruptly pushed upright. Her eyes carried no warmth, only cool reason. "I was drunk, my judgment clouded. You were sober enough to reject me."

Vincent rose as well, his sculpted torso bared to the chilled air. He looked at Hannah, so intent on distance,his stare heavy, his voice tinged with hurt anger. "Reject you? How could I reject when you clung to me,kissing and biting?"
###Chapter 472 Her Goal Was Achieved


Hannah locked eyes with Vincent, a sly curve on her lips. "And why should I decline? Marilyn has arranged dashing escorts for me. I have no shortage of men to share a bed with, and perhaps an escort might even bring me more pleasure than you did."

Vincent's face clouded at once. He abruptly leaned forward, caging her between his arms, his brow furrowed hard. "So now I'm not good enough? Who was gasping with pleasure yesterday? Who pleaded for more rounds even after a shower?"

Hannah's chest gave a tremor beneath his fierce stare, but her features stayed cool. "I was drunk. I can't recall."

"Can't recall?" Vincent barked out a sharp laugh and then tugged at her robe's collar with force.

The fabric slid apart at one edge, laying bare her throat and shoulders, smeared with hickeys and bite marks.

"And these? Forgotten too?" Vincent's fingers traced across her skin. "Your marks are all over me as well.Want me to show you?"

Hannah jerked her face aside, heat spreading to the tips of her ears. She quickly drew the robe tighter wrapping it firmly.

Her reaction made Vincent's anger ebb, replaced by a grave intensity. He dropped his tone, his stare unyielding. "Then answer me-what exactly are we?"

"Friends with benefits," Hannah shot out,almost without thinking

Vincent looked as if the words cut him open. "What did you just say?"

Confronted with his stunned, wounded look, Hannah felt a strange irritation rise, and her tone grew frostier."It was only a one-night stand. What else could it mean?" Hannah let out a cold chuckle. "Don't be ridiculous. Sleeping together doesn't automatically make us an item."

"I mean it." Vincent stood up, his expression grave.

Hannah stood as well, her expression cold and unwavering. "But I have no intention of taking this any further. Last night was nothing but a mistake."

"A mistake?" Vincent retorted. "Then how do you explain it? You kissed me first. You wanted me. You moaned and uttered my name beneath me. Was all that some mistake too?"

Hannah recoiled a step at his raw demand, embarrassment flickering briefly before she masked it again."Given the state I was in last night, it could've been any man. You were no exception."

Suddenly, the suite sank into unbearable quiet, broken only by Vincent's rough, uneven breaths.

Hannah wrenched her eyes away, turned sharply, and vanished into the bathroom, slamming the door shut.Inside, she pulled out her phone and opened a private photo. In it, Vincent slept with her curled against him,the angle blatantly intimate.

She had taken it right after their intimate encounters. From the moment she entered the bar with Marilyn,she knew Vincent had followed her. She had intentionally drowned herself in liquor, intentionally flirted with that dashing escort, and intentionally wielded the cruelest barbs to ignite his fury... Every move served a single aim-to get himn into her bed.

She'd realized that Vincent was right. Sincé Erica had stepped forward claiming to be Brinley Gilbert, the smartest play was to embrace the disguise she'd spun. Whether Erica or Brinley, both shared the same fatal flaw--Vincent. Both harbored an almost obsessive compulsion to claim him. By wielding Vincent, would it still be difficult to uncover Erica's cracks and weaknesses?

Hannah's eyes gleamed with renewed sharpness. She secured Erica's number and sent the intimate photo,adding a scornful line. "Brinley, no matter how you mimic me, Vincent still belongs to me. With the crook of a finger, he comes into my bed." Seeing the delivery status on the screen, Hannah's lips curled in a chilling smirk. She showered again dressed neatly, and smothered every trace of emotion. When she emerged from the bathroom, her face bore its usual calm detachment.

Vincent hadn't moved, still staring out the window, lost deep in thought.

Recalling business, Hannah was first to break the stillness. "We'll handle the plagiarism dispute as you instructed yesterday. Aurora Court Studio will issue an apology, withdraw the game, and pay ten billion dollars in compensation. I'm leaving now."

She grabbed her bag, ready to walk out.

Vincent's gaze followed her, stung by how desperate she was to cut everything off, and it cut like another blade through his chest. His voice came out bitter, raw. "So that's it? One night and you're finished with me?"
###Chapter 473 You'll Be Left WVith Nothing


Hannah halted mid-step, her tone still frosty as she spoke without glancing back. "What more could you possibly seek, Mr. Jones?"

Vincent fixed his gaze on her uncaring figure, a wave of irritation surging uncontrollably within him. "Share a meal with me," he murmured after drawing in a long breath, the request slipping out gradually.

Hannah angled her head ever so slightly, as though considering. After a brief pause of silence, she pivoted,her expression carrying a hint of aloofness. "Alright."

Vincent hadn't imagined she would accept so easily. He pulled a crooked twist at the edge of his lips, his voice tinged with derision. "I assumed you'd reject me."

Hannah regarded him, her stare composed and unwavering."It's merely dinner, after all. You're not about to devour me whole."

Then, she diverted the subject, her voice unhurried. "It's been ages since I saw your grandmother. Why don't we go and have dinner with her?"

Vincent warned, "Erica might be there. Grandma has mistaken her for you."

"Even better. A moment to clear the confusion with her,"Hannah mused.

Elsewhere,Erica barged into Claude's office early in the morning, rage carved across her features. Her pitch was harsh and piercing as she snapped, "Hannah and Vincent have met, and Vincent has recognized I was the imitation! You were aware of all this, weren't you? Why didn't you alert me? You left me unprepared. Are you deliberately making a fool out of me?"

Claude had been seated behind his expansive desk, immersed in documents, when her abrupt entry and flood of accusations interrupted him. He knitted his brows slightly and lifted his gaze, a flicker of annoyance flashing across his features. "Didn't I mention it? Odd... I thought I had."

His inflection was dismissive, as if he were speaking of something utterly meaningless. Erica was driven into fury by his unconcerned demeanor. She struck both palms onto the desk and leaned forward,her stare burning into him, her voice trembling with rage. "Claude Hobbes! How can you remain so careless? Don't you fear Hannah and Vincent might get back together? What will you do then?"

Claude's eyes hardened in an instant, his tone leaving no space for debate. "She will never reconcile with him!

Yet, even as he declared it, his grip tightened on the armrest, betraying the uncertainty buried deep inside him.

Just then, Erica's device suddenly vibrated. Annoyed, she snatched it up and unlocked the screen-only to be met by the image Hannah had sent, showing her entwined with Vincent in bed.

Erica's pupils shrank abruptly. She released a piercing shriek, "That witch-she's provoking me!"

Claude recoiled at her sudden cry, his brows tightening as his voice sliced with warning."Control yourself!This is an office, not a bazaar!"

Erica disregarded decorum. The image had shattered her restraint. She slammed the phone onto Claude's desk, the photo glaring up from the display. "See! Your Hannah is already sharing a bed with Vincent-she even sent me the photo to boast. Aren't you unsettled,Mr.Hobbes?"

Claude's gaze lowered to the device. The instant he absorbed the image, his features darkened into something nearly dreadful. "So what if they lay together once-what does that indicate?" His tone carried dismissal, but simmering wrath pulsed underneath. It sounded less like he was questioning Erica and more like he was trying to convince himself.

He smothered the storm within, a spark of determination flickering in his stare. He could delay no further-he had to secure Hannah at his side, and swiftly. A thought struck him-it was time to have Hannah formally meet his family.

Erica let out a derisive laugh."SC(one night together means nothing? How many times would make it matter?"

Claude pushed to his feet, his towering figure radiating an oppressive force. He shot a glare at Erica,his stare glacial. "Look at you. How pathetic! You transformed your face to Hannah's through countless plastic
surgeries and still failed to make Vincent fall for you!" "You..." Erica's complexion reddened at the insult. "You aren't any better! You haven't won over Hannah either.What grounds do you have to taunt me?"

The air in the office went taut with tension.

Finally, Erica cast Claude a venomous glare. As she departed, she flung back a warning. "They got laid once,and they might do it again. Keep your Hannah on a tighter chain, or after all your plotting, you'll be left with nothing."

Claude smirked. Left with nothing? No-he was not Erica. He would never let that occur.
###Chapter 474 Clumsy Performance


The dining room of the Jones family estate radiated warmth and harmony, yet a quiet tension simmered beneath the surface.

Sharon gazed across the table at Hannah, her expression brimming with affection, her eyes alight with satisfaction. "Hannah, you seem transformed today-vibrant, almost glowing!"

Hannah gently placed her fork and knife down, her voice soft and warm. "Sharon, it feels like ages since we sat together like this. How are you?"

Sharon blinked, caught off guard, and then laughed lightly. "Sweetheart, didn't we just see each other yesterday? Out in the garden, you even helped me prune that orchid. Forgotten already?"

Hannah's smile held, but her eyes took on a somber weight. "Grandma, that wasn't me. Someone altered their face with plastic surgery to impersonate me."

"Plastic surgery?" Sharon's smnile faltered, disbelief etching her features. "How could that be?"

Vincent, seated beside her, gave a solemn nod."It's true, Grandma."

Danica, leisurely sipping her soup beside Sharon, froze at the words. Her spoon clattered against the bowl with a sharp chime as she looked up. "Who would do that? Who changed their face to mimic yours?" she asked, her voice tinged with shock.

Hannah and Vincent exchanged a subtle, knowing glance. This was their strategy: not to reveal Erica's true identity yet, but to cast Brinley as a decoy.

Hannah met Danica's eyes, her tone calm and assured. "It's Brinley."

"Brinley?" Danica's gasp burst forth, her face alight with astonished delight. "She's out of prison? That's wonderful-she's finally-" Her words tripped over each other in her excitement.

Vincent's sharp, warning glance cut through her enthusiasm. Danica's heart skipped, her joy fading instantly. She lowered her gaze, concealing the storm in her eyes. "I got carried away. I've known her since she was a child..."

Sharon's expression darkened, her brows knitting tightly. "So it's truly Brinley? Out already? How could she dare pull something like this? Too reckless..."

Before she could finish, the sharp click of high heels echoed from the entryway.

Erica looked utterly drained-first shaken by Hannah's photo and then worn thin from the company business. She stepped into the dining room, forcing a smile. "Sharon, I'm back-"

Erica's words died as her eyes landed on Hannah. What was she doing here? Did the Jones family already know the truth? She steadied herself, realizing pretense was futile if the truth was exposed. She needed a plan, and quickly.

Hannah broke the silence first, her tone pointed. "Miss Gilbert, we meet again. You look pale-are you unwell, or is there something you're hiding?"

Erica flinched at the blunt jab. She jerked her head up, her expression morphing into one of pitiful vulnerability, eyes welling with tears. "Sharon, Danica, you know the truth now, don't you? I had no choice.After prison, my face was scarred-grotesque, terrifying. I couldn't find work. No one wanted me. Everyone shunned me. All I wanted was to survive."

Erica continued, her voice trembling, "I knew you all adored Hannah, so I thought... I thought if I could become her, would you like me too? Would you treat me kindly? I even threatened to cut off my stepfather to make him pay for the plastic surgery. And it worked-I transformed mysel to look exactly like Hannah."

Her voice broke, thick with feigned emotion. "I came back to the Jones family, and you welcomed me so warmly that I almost believed I was Hannah. Over time, I became too afraid to confess the truth."

Hannah and Vincent listened in silence, their expressions cold and unmoved.

Vincent lifted his coffee cup, taking a deliberate sip, as if he were merely watching a clumsy performance.

Only Danica reacted the way Erica had expected. Seeing Erica's tearful display and hearing her heartrending story, her face softened with pity. "Brinley, you've endured so much... Why are you so foolish? You could

have..."

Sharon observed, her brows furrowed, her gaze conflicted. Though her heart ached, memories of past betrayals steeled her."We'll arrange a new place for you to stay. You cannot remain with the Jones family."

Erica froze. Leave? How did things turn out this way?
 
###Chapter 475 | Want Her To See This


Danica abruptly rose, hurrying to Erica's side, placing herself as a barrier in front of Erica. "Sharon, please,Brinley has already endured punishment for her mistakes. She just got out of prison, and now she has no shelter. Are we truly going to force her away? She has no other place to turn to. Where exactly do you expect her to go?"

Sharon's eyes narrowed further as she regarded the impassioned Danica.

Danica's agitation grew with each word. "I understand my opinion carries little significance in this household. But I'm part of it! Even if it costs me dearly, I must speak my mind! We need to do the right thing!We remain indebted; Brinley's father and brother gave their lives to save Vincent back then! And now,Brinley just wants to live a decent life. Are you seriously trying to strip even that away? Could you really bear to do that?"

Erica leaned out timidly from behind Danica, her eyes glistening with desperation as she pleaded, "Sharon, I genuinely admit my wrongs. I am begging you. Please allow me to stay."

Sharon exhaled wearily, her tone heavy. "Fine. I will not interfere any longer."

With those words, Sharon leaned on her cane and departed from the dining room.

Danica finally released a breath of relief. Sharon's silence confirmed that Brinley could remain. She then turned toward Vincent, who had spoken nothing, and asked carefully, "Brinley will continue to live here. You have no objections, correct?"

Vincent parted his lips faintly. "No objections." Erica had not yet paid the true price, so he would not permit her to slip beyond his reach.

Danica, overcome with feeling, pulled the bewildered Erica into her arms."That's wonderfuI, Brinley! Did you hear? You can stay! I'll arrange for someone to bring down your things from the guest room upstairs.Tonight, you'll share my room. We can finally talk properly." It had been far too long since Danica had someone to confide in. With the return of "Brinley,"she felt genuine joy.

Hannah had been observing with icy indifference. After Danica exited, she approached Erica, her gaze lingering on the face nearly identical to her own, and with a cutting tone, she remarked, "Pathetic. You've altered yourself beyond recognition, only to humbly beg for a place. After all your schemes, what have you gained besides a face that resembles mine?"

Erica felt a stab of pain from Hannah's biting words. But recalling that she had secured her stay within the Jones estate, she regained a sliver of confidence. She lifted her chin, meeting Hannah's stare. "At least Sharon and Danica care for me. They remain by my side. Even with your attempts to expose me, what did you accomplish? They still support me, and I remain with the Jones family! Your efforts failed!"
Hannah studied Erica's smugness, her lips curving in sharper derision. "Who claimed I came to expose you?Unmasking you was just a side task." She paused briefly."My real objective-you'll discover soon enough."

With that,Hannah ignored Erica's stunned look, turning instead to Vincent. "I feel somewhat weary."

Vincent instantly understood. "I'll have someone bring the car around."

Without sparing Erica a glance, the two departed side by side.

Erica watched them leave, unease gnawing deeper within. She could not stop herself from crying out toward Vincent's retreating figure, "Vincent, will you...Will you return?"

Hannah neither paused nor looked back, but she declared, "He's spending the night at my place."

Vincent hesitated faintly, his eyes casting a deep and unreadablelook at Hannah.

Erica's body shook uncontrollably, her fists tightening hard.

Vincent and Hannah hopped into the car.

As the black sedan drove to the entrance of the estate, Hannah broke the silence. "Stop here."

The driver immediately hit the brakes, smoothly halting by the gate. Through the car window, Hannah gazed at the courtyard. Erica stood at the entrance of the main building,staring intently at their car.

A pleased smile touched Hannah's lips. She lowered the car window.

Across the distance, Hannah and Erica locked eyes.

Abruptly, Hannah reached out, seizing Vincent's jaw. Then, in his startled gaze, she pressed her lips to his.Vincent's eyes slid shut, his instincts drawing him closer, his arm instinctively wrapping around her,deepening the kiss. He reached toward the button to roll up the window.

Hannah's lips clung to his, their breaths mingling. She murmured, "Don't. I want her to see this."
###Chapter 476 Do You Not Like It When | Kiss You


Vincent halted his movements. His dark pupils shimmered with a tangled feeling. He spoke no further,simply letting Hannah press her lips against his.

Dozens of meters away, Erica observed everything distinctly-Hannah and Vincent entangled in an intimate kiss inside the car. It was intentional. Hannah intentionally staged the moment for her to witness.

Erica's eyes burned with fury as comprehension struck-this had been Hannah's real purpose! Hannah had not arrived to uncover her secrets but to display triumph. To parade how swiftly she had taken possession of Vincent! How effortlessly she could caress him-claim him. Exactly like that intimate picture on the mattress.

Erica bitterly realized that Hannah was thrusting the bitter truth in her face. Mocking her for every manipulation, each desperate tactic, even altering her appearance, her pitiful begging! Still, she gained nothing. Not a single glance fell from Vincent.

Erica screamed furiously in her heart.

Inside the vehicle, Hannah sensed the charade was enough. She panted faintly, lips parted as she ordered the chauffeur,"Drive."

The chauffeur promptly ignited the ignition and pulled away from the Jones family estate.

Once the car cleared the entrance and flowed into the avenue, Hannah abruptly shifted back, severing all proximity to Vincent. It looked as though the passionate kiss had never occurred. She even brushed her fingertips against her slightly swollen lips, her expression restored to icy composure, laced with cool detachment.

The yearning in Vincent's stare drained swiftly, like waves withdrawing from the shore. He turned aside, his tone resolute as he stated, "You did it on purpose."

He needed no explanation. From her abrupt proposal to visit the Jones estate, to her pointed remarks before Erica that he would stay at her place, and then the staged display of a kiss in Erica's sight,every detail aligned instantly. Hannah hadn't come for a meal; she had come to make a statement. Hannah had wielded him, striking directly at Erica's raw wound, and then savored her collapse.

Hannah locked eyes with him steadily, even tilting her head with a teasing curve at her lips. "Do you not like it when I kiss you?"

She tossed the inquiry at him airily, attempting to shroud his accusation in uncertainty.

Vincent's stare hardened further, his jaw taut. "Don't change the subject."

Hannah let out a light laugh, refusing retreat and instead leaning forward, erasing the gap once more.

The space between them vanished quickly.

She raised her lashes, her clear gaze fixed on him, her look pure."A|Iright, I get it. You dislike it. I won't kiss you next time."

Vincent faltered briefly at her sudden yielding. That wasn't what he meant. Dissatisfied, he retorted, "But if I like it, will you kiss me daily?"

Hannah's grin stiffened, clearly unprepared for Vincent's words. Her eyes wavered briefly, sliding away, her body instinctively retreating, regaining distance. She gave no reply.

Quietness instantly settled within the car.

Vincent noted her fleeting alarm and silence, the gnawing sense of being manipulated still twisting inside him-now sharpened further by her avoidance. He inhaled deeply, pushing down the roiling feelings, and diverted the topic. His voice steadied as he said, "You told Erica I stayed at your place. What exactly are you implying? I am not the type for careless entanglements."

Hannah's eyes turned to the swiftly fading scenery outside the window, her tone even and detached as she answered, "Literal meaning. Aren't you also living in Sterling Heights, same as me?"

She dodged the hidden meaning in his remark, reducing it to plain facts that blocked his attempt at depth.

Vincent felt something lodged within his chest, stirring unrest. He paused for several beats and then muttered,"Fine."

He added, "Honestly, if you have any plans, you can tell me. There's no reason for tricks."

He alluded to her use of him to needle Erica. He didn't oppose helping but despised being blindsided,treated as a pawn.

Hannah kept gazing through the glass. She lingered silent and then murmured, "I don't have any plans."

Vincent studied her outline. Perhaps she believed vengeance upon Erica was her own war. So she cloaked herself in armor, warding off any intimacy or understanding.

Afterward, stillness filled the car, and neither spoke further.

The following day, Hannah was stirred from sleep by the bell chiming at noon. She assumed it might be Vincent; they had parted with tension the night before. He might have arrived seeking to mend the rift.

But when she opened the entrance, the figure outside wasn't Vincent.
###Chapter 477 His Plan


"Claude," Hannah acknowledged him with warmth, her lips curving into a smile.

Hannah's gaze flickered with a trace of astonishment. "Claude, why are you here today?"

Claude's grin broadened. "Weren't you supposed to help me review my dating options? It happens I've got a blind date tonight. It was arranged unexpectedly. Could you give me a hand?"

Hannah tilted her brow, faintly exasperated. "This is terribly sudden. I wasn't ready for it in the least."

Claude jumped in quickly, his tone casual and easy. "I've already made the arrangements. All that's left is for you to join me for dinner. Shall we head out together?"

Catching the sincerity in his expression, Hannah remembered her word and gave a nod."Alright. Wait a moment."

She turned her back and entered her room, changing into relaxed attire.

Claude caught sight of her outfit and his brow creased faintly, though he hid it with a gentle smile. "Hannah,maybe dress alittle sharper? It's quite an important evening, after all. First appearances matter, don't they?"

Hannah glanced down at herself, uncertain. "Why would I need to dress nicely for your date? I'm not the focus here.Wouldn't it make more sense to fade into the background?"

Claude faltered briefly but then laughed softly. His voice carried a gentle indulgence as he answered, "Fair enough, but dressed that way, she might assume you're only a coworker. That wouldn't feel right,would it?"

Hannah sighed."Fine."

She felt blind dates were nothing but troublesome.

She shifted into a modest yet refined pink dress reaching her knees, brushed on light makeup, and let her long hair cascade freely over her shoulders, giving her a fresh and graceful look. She glanced at Claude."How about this? More like your sister now?"
Claude's stare lingered a few moments, his throat tightening slightly. He ignored the "sister" remark, instead offering genuine praise. "You look beautiful. Let's head out."

***

Claude drove Hannah to a refined dining place. With no private room reserved, they took a booth by the window.

Hannah looked faintly perplexed. "Claude, should I arrange a private spot? It might help your talk and keep things quieter."

Claude slid out a chair for her, motioning for her to sit. "No need. This works wvell. It's open and bright,comfortable for chatting."

When seated, she lifted the menu, asking casually, "Claude, when is she meant to come? Did we arrive a bit too early?"

Claude raised his glass of water, concealing his face. "She'll be here shortly. Should we order a drink first?"

No sooner had he spoken than a young woman entered the room, scanning the space.

Claude's eyes gleamed briefly, and he inclined his head toward her.

The three of them settled at the table, the mood stiff at first.

Claude steered the talk, inquiring about the woman's work and pastimes.

Meanwhile, Hannah remained quiet, taking the stance of an attentive observer. Now and then, at Claude's light prompts, she added a question or two, her manner courteous yet distant.

The blind date ended with an air that was courteous, yet plainly formal.

At last, only Claude and Hannah remained at the table.

Hannah lifted her glass, asking, "Claude, how do you feel about her?"

Claude shifted slightly, letting his eyes drift toward a booth nearby where an elegantly dressed couple sat quietly, casting frequent looks their way. It was Claude's parents. The blind date was nothing but a cover. His true goal was to place Hannah before his parents. He knew her well enough to understand that had he invited her directly to meet them, she would have refused outright. Only with the excuse of needing her opinion for his date could he draw her out -and ensure she appeared before his parents as herself, unguarded. He wanted his parents to witness the woman he had chosen.

Hannah stayed completely oblivious to the design.
###Chapter 478 The Woman He Chose


Hienuelh cpserved thet Chande gae wo tatly assumuina he uuig/wt wot wave carradwt ter moids so she rebereied herself," Cemdie, Ivoror dio yomn ruane thea ladyo"

Claude absorbed her umpertial and reasoned opinion unsettled by mixed sentiments. It was not the response he had wislved for.

He lifted his cup of coffee to veil his feelings and then artfully transitionod the subject toivard his underlying goal."Hmm, I'll keep it in nund Speaking of which, there's an elite chanty gala coming up, quite a grand affair, with many distinguished attendees How about I bring you along? It'll provide valuable exposure and an excellent chance to introduce you to several contacts, which could broaden your network for your profession."

His voice carried an effortless air, as though the suggestion had just surfaced.
29Hannah arched her brow faintly. "Alright, it'Il be valuable exposure."

Claude's mouth curved into a faint smile. His parents would also be at the ggala.

He intended to publicly present Hannah to them before the notable audience, signaling that she was tho woman he had chosen.


**8

Within the charity gala, Claude guided Hannah across the gathering with composure, acquainting her with respected corporate figures and admired personalities in culture. Hannah maintained elegance and poise.

Claude smiled slyly. The crucial introductions were completed. He swept the hall with his eyes and noticed his mother and father conversing with longtime acquaintances. He drew in a steadying breath and brought Hannah toward them.

"Mom, Dad," Claude greeted them with a tender smile. "This is Hannah Scott, the young lady I've often spoken of."

Terrell Hobbes and Evelyn Hobbes pivoted toward them.

Terrell retained his stern presence, granting only a minimal nod while his piercing eyes measured Hannah carefully.

Evelyn displayed a gracious smile, her tone warm and polished. "Greetings, Ms.Scott."

"Greetings, Mr. and Mrs. Hobbes." Hannah inclined her head lightly, her smile composed.

Following the exchange, the mood grew somewhat strained.

Terrell and Evelyn refrained from deepening the dialogue, simply maintaining courtesy.

Then, an energetic feminine voice suddenly lifted the tension, "Mr. and Mrs. Hobbes, you've come as well!"

Lindsay arrived, clad in a refined pink cocktail gown, gleefully hurrying over.

Evelyn's expression brightened instantly upon spotting Lindsay. She extended her hand with affection,clasping Lindsay's fingers. Her tone carried unmistakable warmth, "Lindsay, such joy to see you. And look,Claude is present too!"

Lindsay addressed them with polite civility,"Hello,Claude,and Ms. Scott."

Evelyn kept hold of Lindsay's hand, gazing upon her with fond admiration. "Lindsay, are you acquainted with Ms.Scott?"

Lindsay's lips curved sweetly. "We've crossed paths briefly."

Lindsay's father had cleverly shifted attention by confronting Nikolas at the fencing arena to conceal her misconduct. Without that, the Hobbes household would never have embraced her so favorably. Her presence at the gala was arranged through Elvin's probing efforts.

Evelyn continued her lively conversation with Lindsay, openly neglecting Hannah, who remained beside them.

Terrell, though less verbose, directed a kind regard toward Lindsay, occasionally adding comments,blending into an easy and natural rapport with her.

Together, the three formed an intimate circle, treating Hannah and Claude as though unseen.

Hannah lingered quietly at the edge, unfazed by their disregard, even finding comfort in the seclusion.

Claude's composure faltered. He had not foreseen his parents being so indifferent, plainly showing a preference for Lindsay while overlooking Hannah.He turned toward Hannah, murmuring contritely, "Forgive me, Hannah. They just need more time with you. Things will improve once familiarity grows. Don't let it trouble you."

Hannah faced him with a calm smile."1"alright, Claude." Her eyes were steady and luminous, free of complaint or resentment.

Claude observed her tranquil and unwavering demeanor, only feeling more frustrated within.

Across the opposite side of the banquet chamber, Bobby spotted Hannah alongside Claude's parents while he engaged with acquaintances. He deliberated briefly and chose to place a call to Vincent.
###Chapter 479 You Find It Distinctive


The phone call linked almost instantly.

Vincent was occupied with work. "What is it?"

Bobby laughed under his breath. "Guess who I just spotted here?"

Vincent's expression tightened subtly. "Who?"

Bobby rattled off quickly, "Hannah! That scoundrel Claude escorted her to the charity auction gala to introduce her to his parents. The scene was quite a spectacle!"

Abruptly, the line on the opposite side dropped into absolute quiet. Bobby could even catch the sound of Vincent's breath growing heavier and restrained.

Moments later, Vincent's reply cut through, each syllable cold and precise."Where are you?"

Bobby immediately forwarded him the location.

***

Inside the charity auction gala, every guest was obligated to contribute a personal belonging for bidding.The full revenue would be donated.

The auction proceeded in a structured sequence, the mood becoming steadily more spirited.

Piece after piece, glittering gems, masterworks, and heirlooms appeared before the crowd, sparking waves of offers from attendees.

Lindsay stayed closely linked with Evelyn's arm, occasionally leaning in to murmur remarks about the pieces, her voice steeped in condescension.

Hannah remained composed beside Claude.

The auctioneer's commanding tone carried over the audience. "Next up-a retro mechanical wristwatch,
provided by an unnamed contributor. Starting bid: one million."

Under the glaring lights, the men's mechanical timepiece appeared plain, almost obsolete, clashing with the radiant ornaments and renowned canvases.

"Ha-" Lindsay's derisive giggle shattered the hush. She covered her lips as though faced with something absurd."Oh dear, who would submit such a pitiful item here? Nowadays, an old battered watch marked at a million? Who could possibly want it? It's laughable!"

While sneering, Lindsay purposely angled her head toward Evelyn, fishing for support.

Yet, the anticipated agreement never arrived. The three members of the Hobbes household stayed strangely muted.

Terrell's countenance darkened swiftly, his eyes edged with irritation and slight insult.

Evelyn's smile stiffened midway; she discreetly tugged Lindsay's sleeve, urging her to hold her tongue.

Claude's forehead creased even more.

Hannah interjected, breaking the weight of silence, "I believe this piece is rather distinctive."

Terrell swiveled toward Hannah abruptly, traces of surprise flashing. "Oh? Ms. Scott, you find it distinctive?For what reason?"

"This watch, though outdated in design... the face is tinted, and the strap bears marks of wear..." Hannah hesitated briefly, her gaze locking back onto the piece. "It's been carefully preserved. Judging by its condition and the steady ticking, it must have been treasured deeply. Likely/ gifted by someone important,bearing sentimental worth beyond its price. That's why I findit distinctive."

Terrell looked into Hannah's clear eyes, feeling a tremendous wave of emotion. That timepiece had indeed been his late father's graduation gift. It never bore any luxury label, but it had been bought with hard-earned savings. It had stayed with him through the harshest early struggles of his career, among his dearest keepsakes. He submitted it to the auction intending to quietly support charity. He never imagined this young woman could discern its story so swiftly.
Terrell paused for several seconds and then inclined his head. "You have remarkable insight, Ms. Scott." His manner softened at once, his eyes on Hannah filled with respect.

Claude, standing nearby, could not hide a satisfied grin.

Lindsay, watching the Hobbes family's attention rest on Hannah, sulked with irritation. It was nothing but a shabby trinket; what could be so noteworthy?

At that moment, the auctioneer smoothly picked up again. "Opening bid: one million. Commence bidding!"

Still, the hall remained hushed. Most present failed to recognize the value or dismissed it as irrelevant.

Lindsay looked all the more scornful.

Terrell was about to raise his paddle to bid on the watch when Hannah beat him to it.

"One million," the auctioneer declared, pointing to Hannah.

No further voices joined in.

Hannah claimed the timepiece at the initial figure without resistance.

Lindsay eyed Hannah and broke into another laugh. "Ms. Scott, you seriously purchased it? Wasting a million on something so unworthy of this venue? You certainly have peculiar judgment! Whoever contributed that piece, even if it's charity, ought to have provided something fitting, not something worthless, and yet dared to label it at a million."

Claude murmured with amusement,"Idiot."

The Hobbes family turned their eyes toward Lindsay with clear disapproval.

Lindsay felt their stares and asked in bafflement,"Why are you watching me like that? I haven't said anything wrong."
###Chapter 480 Caused Trouble


Hannah paid no attention to Lindsay's scornful words. She rose from her seat and moved directly to the display table. Lifting the carefully wrapped vintage watch, she turned around and walked toward Terrell.

Cradling the box with both hands, Hannah earnestly addressed Terrell, "Mr. Hobbes, you're its rightful owner. A present from a dear one cannot be measured in price. I merely stumbled upon a hidden gem."

"You..." Lindsay was completely stunned by the sight. She exclaimed, "How could you hand over such a roughly-looking thing to Mr. Hobbes? That's unbelievably insulting!"

Lindsay had no idea she had once again spoken out of turn.

This time, Evelyn grew truly alarmed. "Lindsay, that's enough!" She yanked Lindsay's arm with force,sharply halting Lindsay before she said something worse.

Terrell refrained from taking the box at once. His sharp eyes locked on Hannah. He asked, "Claude, were you the one who told her this belonged to me?"

Lindsay stood dumbfounded. Could that actually be Terrell's possession? How was it possible? He has vast wealth. How could he own such a worthless trinket?

Claude shook his head without hesitation, his voice firm. "No. I've never spoken of this watch to her."

Hannah met Terrell's piercing gaze and replied with composure, "Mr. Hobbes, I guessed."

A spark lit up in Terrell's eyes. "Explain your deduction."

Hannah gave a faint smile, her tone soft. "It wasn't dificult. When the auctioneer introduced this item, your demeanor shifted. I guessed it might be yours then. But the strongest clue came when Ms. Cortez ridiculed it-you looked offended, which told me the item mattered to you deeply. Moreover, you submitted the piece yet chose not to reveal your identity, proving it carried intimate meaning. So I concluded it was yours, and that it held immense significance." Hannah's precise, thoughtful reasoning drew the full attention of everyone, especially Terrell. The last flicker of suspicion disappeared from his eyes, replaced with open admiration.

Terrell extended his hands solemnly and accepted the small box. "Ms. Scott, your observations are remarkable."

Lindsay's complexion drained at once. She finally grasped the gravity of her blunder. She had ridiculed what turned out to be Terrell's most treasured item. Frightened, she hurried forward, tears shaking her voice. "Mr.Hobbes, I didn't intend that. I had no idea it belonged to you. If I'd known, I would never have spoken those words."

Terrell ignored Lindsay completely. HHe quietly placed the box inside his suit pocket. His unbroken silence cut Lindsay deeper and shamed her more than any harsh rebuke could.

Lindsay turned desperately to Evelyn, pleading, "Mrs. Hobbes, I truly didn't mean it. Please trust me!"

Evelyn studied Lindsay's frantic look, her heart weighed down with both disappointment and dismay. She let out a sigh and softly tapped Lindsay's hand. "That's enough. Lindsay, say no more. Let's pay attention to the following auction pieces now."

Evelyn withdrew her hand and directed her focus back toward the auction platform, refusing to look at Lindsay again.

Lindsay remained motionless, terror threatening to consume her entirely. She noticed Terrell lean slightly and murmur something to Evelyn.

Terrell's voice was low. "I could see through Lindsay's true color. Clearly, she's someone who curries favor with the powerful while looking down on those without any connection. But Ms. Scott has left me genuinely impressed."

Lindsay heard every word. The statement shattered her completely. She had utterly forfeited Terrell's favor and perhaps Evelyn's regard as well. She placed all the blame on Hannah.

Lindsay's eyes burned with bitter hatred and fury.

Claude also had caught Terrell's words. Beaming, he turned toward Hannah, speaking with warmth."Why did you bid for the watch earlier? Was it for me?"
###Chapter 481 The Only One In The World


Claude turned his gaze toward Hannah at his side, eager for what she might say.

Hannah's eyes flicked to Lindsay, who stood not far away, forcing a grin while enduring an uneasy exchange with Evelyn.

The corners of Hannah's mouth curved playfully.′′Amixture, really. At first, I planned to stay silent, but Lindsay's endless arrogance was downright intolerable."

Hannah leaned slightly toward Claude, mischief glimmering in her stare. "She tried so hard to charm your parents, yet it blew up spectacularly. I suspect your father has already written her off as Hobbes' potential in-law material. She must be unraveling over it."

Claude let out a low laugh, warmth softening his expression. "You always catch the subtleties. For a moment, I almost thought you were chasing that watch yourself."

Hannah lifted the champagne glass, her voice composed. "I don't snatch away what others fancy."

Pleasing elders and reading moments were second nature to Hannah. How else could she, hailing from an ordinary family background, endure within a wealthy household? These instincts were honed after she became Vincent's wife.

Claude studied Hannah, his chest tightening faintly.11|there any piece here that appeals to you? I'd gladly secure it as thanks for what you did earlier."

Hannah's eyes skimmed across the display table, and she gave a faint shake of her head. "Nothing for now,but | appreciate it, Claude."

Just then, the auctioneer's lively voice filled the air."Next comes an exceptionally rare gemstone necklace,titled 'Ember Star', provided by Ms. Cortez."

Under the lights, a sapphire-laden necklace shimmered with dazzling brilliance. The auctioneer spoke with mounting enthusiasm. "Ladies and gentlemen, 'Ember Star' is the work of a premier jewelry artisan, crafted over years. Its centerpiece is the exceedingly rare 'Deep Sea Eye' sapphire,fashioned with a distinctive cut. More importantly, it is singular-no duplicate exists anywhere! Ms. Cortez has shown remarkable generosity and goodwill. The bidding will open at fifteen million dollars!"

The crowd instantly broke into gasps and admiration.

"Heavens, how exquisite! Ms. Cortez's generosity is unmatched."

"So magnanimous! She truly embodies the spirit of the Cortez heiress!"

The earlier commotion involving Lindsay/and Terrell faded away entirely, eclipsed by awe for the jewel.

Evelyn glanced at Lindsay in astonishment, her expression glowing with satisfaction. "Lindsay, your kindness shines through. You've given up something so precious."

Lindsay's lips curved proudly, her chin tited upward as she basked in the recognition."It's only right, Mrs.Hobbes. True charity demands sincerity. Wealth is nothing more than material."

But at Claude's side, Hannah's brow knit deeply when her eyes landed on the necklace. She recognized it all too well. Because she possessed the same so-called singular piece. That was a gift from Vincent after their marriage.

Lindsay, blind to anything beyond the acclaim, rose to her feet, unable to suppress herself. With pride radiating and her voice deliberately loud, she proclaimed, "This necklace is my treasured jewel. The auctioneer has already stated its uniqueness-one of a kind werldwide. Fifteen million dollars is hardly much. I hope you will all bid freely for charity's sake. Thank you."

Her words ignited an even fiercer frenzy. The numbers climbed swiftly, until the hall erupted when a call of "one hundred million" rang out.

Even Lindsay gasped, her hand covering her lips in disbelief. She had never dreamed the necklace would command such an astronomical value. It was a triumph both in reputation and fortune.

The auctioneer's voice quavered with exhilaration."One hundred million, first call! One hundred million,second call! One hundred million,thi−′′ Just before the gavel fell, Hannah cut across the room."Wait!"
###Chapter 482 Stopping The Auction


The auctioneer's gesture stopped abruptly in the air.He hesitated in surprise, directing a puzzled look toward Hannah. "Ms. Scott, did you just submit a higher bid? One hundred and ten million dollars?"

His immediate thought was that Hannah had entered the bidding.

Lindsay's expression, previously glowing with triumph, shifted into one tinged with ridicule. She let out a cold laugh. "Ms. Scott, no matter how much you admire this necklace, you should weigh whether you're capable of affording it before becoming too eager. One hundred million dollars isn't a trivial figure."

Claude narrowed his eyes, speaking in a firm,resonant tone. "If she places a bid, I cover it. Is that an issue?"

Both Terrell and Evelyn fixed their attention on
Claude,faint displeasure flashing in their gaze.

Claude prepared to lift his paddle to signal.

Yet, Hannah extended her hand to restrain him,giving a slight shake of her head. She faced the auctioneer and declared, "Apologies, I didn't raise my paddle just now. I wasn't placing a bid. What I intended was to announce a suspension of the auction."

A suspension of the auction? The hall burst into startled murmurs, all eyes swinging toward Hannah in disbelief.

Lindsay sprang up in fury, her voice sharp and cutting. "Is this how you conduct matters? The deal was nearly complete, and we were close to raising one hundred million for charity. What do you mean by 'stopping it? Are you sabotaging this deliberately to oppose me?"

Hannah responded to Lindsay's accusations with composed poise. "Why get so worked up, Ms.Cortez? I'm merely calling for a proper halt. I just
realized that the necklace you brought may be a forgery."

Her statement instantly ignited a storm of chatter throughout the venue.

Lindsay raised her tone higher, hurling accusations at Hannah. "We're both women. Can't you stop singling me out? Fine-you're claiming the necklace is counterfeit? Produce your proof. Anyone can fling reckless words!"

Hannah stepped closer, moving toward the display table and carefully examining the jewelry. "The evidence is straightforward. First, the authentic 'Ember Star' necklace's centerpiece is 15 carats.This stone is at most 10. Second, the real 'Ember Star' shines flawlessly under strong illumination with ·uniform fiery brilliance. Everyone, please look closely at this one-it shows a yellow tint and visible flaws.That suffices to confirm it as an imitation."

"Absurd!" Lindsay screeched. "You must have rehearsed that little speech in advance."
Guests nearby began to whisper among themselves.

"The piece is owned by Ms. Cortez. Surely she would know better than anyone."

"Exactly-Ms. Cortez has been surrounded by extravagance all her life. How could she possibly own something false? That lady must be inventing lies out of envy."

Hearing the crowd lean toward her side, Lindsay regained her confidence, a trace of victory returning to her expression. She urged the auctioneer, "Sir,continue as planned. Pay her no mind."

"The sale cannot proceed under suspicion of fraud,"Hannah cut in firmly once again. "According to the regulations for charity auctions, if the item proves false later, the pledged donations could be revoked.That would tarnish the charity's credibility and cause loss to all donors. Ms. Cortez, can you shoulder that responsibility?"

Lindsay faltered at Hannah's pressing words,stepping back while still protesting. "This was a
birthday present from my father last year. There's no way it's fake!"

Hannah seized upon the crucial point. "What a coincidence. Last year, I also received a necklace called 'Ember Star.'"

The room roared with astonishment once again.

"What? Two of the same piece?"

"Weren't there supposed to be only one in existence?"

Lindsay snapped back instantly. "Then yours must be the forgery!"

Hannah locked eyes with her, gaze unwavering. "It's impossible that mine is counterfeit."

·Because that was bestowed by Vincent. With his flawless integrity, it was unthinkable that he would ever present her with something false.

Lindsay curled her lips in scorn, her contempt plain.
"Why not? Who do you believe yourself to be,
declaring it genuine simply because you said so?"

Neither woman yielded, their confrontation unshaken.

Claude stepped in, breaking the deadlock with steady authority. "Ms. Cortez, what point is there in disputing endlessly? Let a professional assessor make a clear judgment."

He addressed the auctioneer, "Please bring in an expert appraiser immediately."

Then, Vincent's deep, commanding voice rolled through the hall's entrance. "She speaks the truth."
###Chapter 483 Defending Her


Since Vincent's words came right after hers, Lindsay naturally assumed he was supporting her claim. She instantly puffed up with pride, that smug smile returning to paint her features. "Mr. Jones, thank you. Finally, someone with sense speaks up for me.I knew Hannah's necklace had to be counterfeit."

But Vincent didn't even acknowledge her existence.His.commanding presence moved straight toward Hannah instead. Positioning himself protectively at her side, his cold gaze swept across the gathered crowd. "What I meant was that Ms. Scott is absolutely correct. Her necklace isn't fake!"

·Shocked gasps rippled through the room like wildfire.Vincent's forceful statement hit Lindsay like a physical blow.

Lindsay's victorious expression crumbled, morphing into something ugly and bitter. "Vincent, just
because Hannah is your ex-wife doesn't mean you should defend her so blindly! You're leaning toward her while ignoring the facts!"

Lindsay had already investigated thoroughly through her own channels. Following their last encounter at the fencing club, she'd sensed Vincent's unwavering support for Hannah. Deeper investigation had revealed the stunning truth. Former husband and wife, divorced and separated. To think Claude chose a divorcee over her was a slap in the face for her.And thus, her jealousy and hatred toward Hannah burned with the intensity of molten lava.

Lindsay's bombshell revelation ignited the room like gasoline meeting flame. The announcement particularly stunned the businessmen, who prioritized commerce over gossip.

Terrell and Evelyn wore expressions of visible disgust, rage and disappointment coursing through them as. they thought of Claude's inexplicable fascination with Hannah. Their son was pursuing a divorced woman? Absolutely unacceptable!
"Lindsay, shut your mouth!" Claude's face darkened with murderous fury as he delivered the sharp rebuke.

But Lindsay stubbornly stood her ground, jabbing her finger toward Hannah with venomous mockery. "I'm stating facts! Hannah did divorce Mr. Jones; that's undeniable reality! So Mr. Jones, your words defending your ex-wife carry no credibility. Everyone should think twice before swallowing everything they hear!"

She desperately tried to destroy Vincent's credibility by hammering home the "ex-wife" angle.

Vincent's presence turned so glacial that the entire room seemed to plummet several degrees. His lips barely moved as he delivered the killing blow."Because Ms. Scott's 'Ember Star' necklace was my personal gift to her. Crystal clear?"

"A gift from Mr. Jones? Which means Miss Cortez's must be the counterfeit?"
present someone with a fake. On the flip side, Miss Cortez's is clearly the imitation."

"Thank heaven this came to light before the auction concluded! Can you imagine the catastrophe of someone spending one hundred million on a fake?The charity's reputation would be destroyed!"

Chaos erupted among the guests, particularly from the billionaire who'd placed the hundred-million bid.He frantically wiped cold perspiration from his brow,weak with relief.

Contemptuous and furious stares converged on Lindsay from every direction.

Lindsay's entire frame shook with violent tremors.She clung to her denial with desperate fervor."I refuse to believe this! Unless you produce the actual "'Ember Star' for comparison, you're fabricating lies to protect Hannah! You're both conspiring to deceive everyone here!"

Vincent observed her pitiful thrashing with pure revulsion and scorn. "A fool."
Dismissing her completely, Vincent turned toward Hannah, his voice softening to velvet. "Derek's already on his way to collect it. It will be here soon."

Hannah held his gaze with unshakeable composure."Okay."

A brief hesitation crossed her features before she asked, "What brought you here so unexpectedly?"

Vincent's lips curved in quiet amusement. "Naturally,I'm here to contribute to a worthy cause."

His attention drifted casually toward Terrell and Evelyn standing in the distance.

Claude lingered nearby, his face etched with barely concealed tension.

.After a while, Derek made his entrance. He carried an elegant velvet jewelry case, accompanied by a distinguished middle-aged gentleman who was a celebrated jewelry expert in the field.

Vincent gave a subtle nod of acknowledgment.

Derek advanced purposefully, opening the jewelry box with ceremonial precision as every eye fixed upon him.

The moment it opened, the assembled crowd gasped at the necklace's sheer magnificence and artistry. It was absolutely stunning.

Vincent's icy stare locked onto Lindsay's ashen face as his words cut through the air like steel. "To eliminate any chance of Miss Cortez's denial, l've brought along a certified appraiser. The evaluation can commence immediately."
###Chapter 484 Competing For Her

With fury in her eyes, Lindsay lunged ahead and yanked her submitted necklace from the stand. "No, I won't allow the appraisal! I'm pulling it out-I refuse to auction it!"

Lindsay was consumed by unease. The moment the two pieces lay side by side, the difference was undeniable-the counterfeit was glaring. If the appraisal continued, humiliation would be her only outcome.

Whispers erupted, swelling into harsh condemnation.

"She's just terrified of the truth, backing out before the test.Pathetic!"

"Imagine daring to parade a fake necklace at an auction-Ms.Cortez has no shame!"

Each cutting remark sliced through Lindsay's composure. Her chest tightened, and unable to withstand the barrage, she Lowered her head and stumbled out of the auction hall.

Vincent let his gaze follow her retreat only briefly before shifting back to Hannah. He gestured toward the authentic Ember Star necklace Derek had just delivered. "Want me to put it on you?"

Hannah's eyes remained steady, devoid of any longing. "Let's give it to charity instead." Her words landed sharp and unyielding, her tone as cool as glass.

Vincent gave her a subtle nod. "Alright. That one is last year's creation. I'll make sure you have a new one later."

Respecting her choice, he gestured for Derek to pass the
Respecting her choice, he gestured for Derek to pass the jewelry box to the auctioneer.

The auctioneer accepted it with barely contained excitement,and the hall erupted into cheers and applause.

As the final hammer fell and the auction wrapped up smoothly,guests began filing out in clusters, their voices buzzing with speculation.

Claude lingered, his gaze snagging on the quiet understanding that seemed to flow between Vincent and Hannah. A sharp pang twisted through him. Drawing a steadying breath,he forced down the storm in his chest and stepped forward. "Anna,let me take you home," he offered, his voice carrying more weight than he intended.

Vincent's words cut in-firm, unyielding. "Don't bother. I'll take her myself."

Claude locked eyes with Vincent, refusing to back down. "Mr.Jones, what makes you so sure she'll leave with you? Keep in mind, the two of you are already divorced."

He deliberately leaned on the word divorced, cutting a sharp line between Vincent and Hannah.

Vincent's gaze narrowed, shadows flickering in his stormy eyes."I'm not sure," he admitted evenly. "I'm competing."

His blunt honesty made it unmistakable-he wanted Hannah,and he wasn't embarrassed to declare it.

"Competing?" Claude gave a low laugh, the sound edged with amusement. "Now that's interesting."

"Shouldn't you ask what I think?" Hannah's cool voice sliced through the tension, halting the wordless clash between the two men. Her brows knit together as she surveyed them both,her gaze sharp and unflinching.
"Who gets to take me home is up to me." Her tone carried a crisp finality, leaving no room for argument.

Claude leaned toward her, his expression laced with sincerity."Anna, I brought you here, so I should be the one to make sure you get back safely."

Vincent's eyes followed her just as intently."I'm heading back to Sterling Heights. Come with me-it's along the way."

Claude's brow furrowed, baffled at when Vincent had taken up residence there.

Hannah lowered her gaze to her phone, her fingers brushing across the screen as if a message had caught her attention.Then,with sudden resolve, she lifted her head. "No. Neither of you needs to take me. I'll get back on my own."

Without another glance, she stepped past them, lifted a hand,and hailed the first taxi that slowed at the curb. Behind her,the door clicked firmly into place.

Claude watched the retreating taillights, his lips pulling into a bitter half-smile. "Seems like we both lost this round."

Vincent's eyes lingered on the road where she had vanished,his tone low and steady. "She's not something to win or lose."

Just then, Terrell and Evelyn strode over, their faces stern.

Evelyn's voice cut sharply through the night. "Claude.Come with us." Her tone brooked no refusal.

Claude's brows drew together, a faint crease deepening between them as he cast a look at Vincent.
Vincent answered with the barest nod, lips pressed shut, and pivoted away, his measured stride carrying him toward his car.
Inside a quiet side lounge, Evelyn pushed the door closed with deliberate force, her expression more severe than he had ever
deliberate force, her expression more severe than he had ever seen. "Claude, listen to me. I don't care what you say-I cannot,and will not, approve of that Hannah."

Her words rang out, clipped and uncompromising.

Frustration flared in Claude's chest, and he tried to reason with her. "Mom, you saw her yourself. She's sharp, she's steady under pressure, and she just saved everyone from taking a huge loss. How can that not count for anything?"

Evelyn's frown tightened, her tone turning cold and merciless."All that means nothing! Letting a divorcee join our family still disgraces us! We are the Hobbes family, a name with standing and reputation. How can you expect us to accept a divorced woman as your wife? The moment people find out, what will they say about us? About you?"
###Chapter 485 Twice The Asking Price
Evelyn turned to Terrell, who had remained silent throughout the exchange. "Come on, Terrell, speak up!"
Terrell finally broke his silence, adding his voice to the persuasion. "Claude, I'll admit that Ms. Scott does command my admiration. Her vision and courage are truly extraordinary."
His tone shifted, growing stern. "But that doesn't mean she's suitable to be your wife! Listen to your mother. This matter isn't open for discussion."
Evelyn immediately seized the moment, her voice taking on a coaxing tone. "Be reasonable, Claude! Marriage is a significant family affair that can't be treated lightly. It must be between equals,respectable and fitting!"
A chill settled in Claude's heart, defiance blazing in his eyes.Looking at his father, his voice carried a probing edge. "What if I only want to marry Hannah,and no one else?"
Terrell's gaze sharpened like a blade. "Then we might have to reconsider your position as heir to the Hobbes family. Are you certain you want to sacrifice the entire family business for just one woman? Abandon everything you've worked so hard to achieve all these years? Give up all that's within your grasp?And if you surrender all of this, how can you be sure Hannah is willing to face life's hardships alongside you?"

Evelyn rushed forward, her fingers digging into Claude's arm as desperation crept into her voice. "Yes, Claude, she's just a woman! Why surrender everything over her? At worst, marry someone suitable and keep her as your mistress afterward. We won't say a word! Why fall out with your family over her? She's simply not worth it!"

Listening to Evelyn's "generous" proposal, bitter irony flooded Claude's chest like poison. These were his biological parents,the very people whose bloodline he carried. This was the "family love" he'd gained after reconnecting with them years back.When money and the sacred "family reputation" were at stake, his heart and dreams became disposable trash. They casually demanded he discard the woman who owned his soul and then magnanimously permitted him to keep her as a secret plaything after marriage. How ironic!

Claude's eyes drifted shut. When they opened again, every trace of struggle, defiance, and rage had been swept away like dust in the wind. His voice emerged flat and hollow, stripped of all emotion. "Understood. I'll comply with your wishes."

"That's my good son!" Evelyn's face transformed instantly,blooming with triumphant relief as though she'd just solved the world's greatest crisis!

Terrell gave a curt nod, satisfaction gleaming in his calculating eyes.

Claude's expression remained carved from stone. So this was his reward for reconnecting with his biological family. Complete submission to their every whim! Step out of line, and they'd dangle his inheritance like a carrot before a starving horse.These suffocating days made his time with the Scott family feel like paradise lost.



Hannah skipped the taxi ride home, choosing instead to visit a private art gallery. She settled quietly on the second floor,observing the scene unfolding below.

Erica was here as well. She lingered before an Impressionist masterpiece, weighing whether it might capture Sharon's approval.

After considerable deliberation, Erica reached her decision.
 After considerable deliberation, Erica reached her decision.Beckoning the gallery owner over, she gestured toward the canvas. "I'll take this piece. Please have it wrapped for me."

The gallery owner, a polished middle-aged gentleman named Gibson Shaw, appeared genuinely troubled. Regret flickered across his refined features. "I'm terribly sorry,but this painting has already been claimed."

Hannah and Gibson were longtime acquaintances. She'd warned him that whatever caught this particular woman's eye should be declared unavailable.

If Hannah hadn't given the heads-up, Gibson might have gasped, even thinking they were the same woman. Their resemblance was truly striking.

Erica's brow creased with irritation. "So soon? I just set my eyés on it, and it's already sold?"

Gibson offered a respectful bow. "My sincere apologies, but another customer secured it first. We're preparing to package it now."

At his subtle gesture, staff members began wrapping the artwork.

Erica's teeth found her lower lip, her voice rising with entitled demand. "I'll pay twice the asking price. Sell it to me instead!"

Gibson maintained his professional composure. "Miss, integrity forms the foundation of all business dealings. That simply isn't possible."

After a calculated pause, his tone shifted subtly. "However, the buyer is actually here today, relaxing upstairs. Why don't you speak with her directly? Maybe she'll be willing to part with it?"

Weighing her chances of securing the painting and earning Sharon's favor, Erica gave a sharp nod. "Fine. Where is she?"

"Right this way, please." Gibson gracefully stepped aside to guide her path.

The moment Erica climbed to the second floor and spotted Hannah lounging comfortably on the sofa, completely at ease,she froze mid-step. Her expression soured instantly. "Why are you here?"
###Chapter 486 He Will Never Marry You

Hannah placed her mug down with a delicate chime.Lifting her gaze slowly, she locked eyes with Erica, a mischievous smile dancing across her features. "I'm here for artwork. What's so strange about that?"

Gibson presented the painting to Hannah, who made a show of studying it carefully. While pretending to admire the brushwork,she discreetly attached a small bug to the frame before casually setting it aside.

Erica loomed over her, voice razor-sharp with accusation."A coincidence, huh? The exact painting I desired, you happen to want too? You're obviously targeting me deliberately!"

Hannah sank deeper into the plush sofa, her posture becoming even more leisurely. "Does my intent really matter? The painting belongs to me now. And no one could steal it away from me, regardless of the tactics applied."

Her words carried layers of hidden meaning. Her gaze lingered meaningfully on Erica's face, which bore a striking resemblance to her own.

Erica bristled with barely contained fury,fighting to control her rage. "Name your price. I need this painting! What will it take for you to part with it?"

Hannah's smile widened, cold calculation gleaming in her dark eyes. "Miss Gilbert, you appear remarkably well-funded. Hardly the appearance of someone fresh from jail."

Panic flickered briefly in Erica's gaze before she masked it with forced confidence.′′My/stepfather is wealthy, so what? That's none of your concern."
Hannah's soft laughter carried a cutting edge,her stare turning predatory. "Stepfather? If my memory serves, you two barely tolerate each other. Why would he suddenly become so generous with his wallet and allow such frivolous expenditures?"

"You!" Erica's composure shattered, her voice becoming a harsh screech. "Enough games. Are you selling it or not?"

Witnessing her complete meltdown, Hannah's face twisted wvith undisguised contempt. She gracefully lifted her mug,breathing softly across the rising steam of the coffee. "Of course,I'm willing to part with it. Simpy tack on two hundred thousand to the listed price."

Murderous hatred blazed in Erica's stare. Yet, understanding how crucial this painting was for winning Sharon's approval, she swallowed her rage. Yanking a card from her purse, she slammed it onto the table."Fine."

She snatched the wrapped artwork and spun toward the exit.

As Erica retreated, Hannah's voice cut through the air like ice."Miss Gilbert, do your sins ever keep you awake at night? After all the darkness you've spread, does your conscience ever find peace?"

Erica's footsteps froze, her entire frame shaking violently.Without turning or uttering a word, she fled down the staircase.

Outside,torrential rain had trapped numerous patrons under the gallery's awning.

Erica clutched the painting protectively while frantically calling for transportation.

Hannah had slipped downstairs unnoticed and now stood silently at Erica's side.

A passerby, struck by their uncanny similarity, burst out in amazement. "Wow! Are you two twins? The resemblance is
amazement. "Wow! Are you two twins? The resemblance is absolutely stunning!"

Hannah gave a subtle shake of her head. "No."

Catching the stranger's comment and spotting Hannah nearby,Erica's lips twisted into a mocking sneer. "Ms. Scott, don't you have countless admirers at your beck and call? Both Claude and Vincent worship the ground you walk on! So what's wrong?With this downpour, nobody's rushing to your rescue? Perhaps they've finally grown weary of your charms and simply forgotten you exist?"

Meeting Erica's taunting stare head-on,Hannah's mouth curved into an arctic smile. "What about you? Miss Gilbert, won't you and that precious painting get completely soaked?"

"You!" Erica shot back immediately, smugness creeping into her tone. "Who claims I'm stranded here alone? Danica absolutely adores me! The moment she heard about the storm,she dispatched the driver to collect me! She should arrive any moment now!"

Hannah's laughter rang with cruel amusement. "Really? Unable to capture her son's heart, so you're desperately courting his mother's favor instead? Truly pitiful."

"What right do you have to mock me?" Erica's composure exploded completely, words tumbling out in a venomous rush."You're nothing but discarded goods! Do you honestly believe Vincent will ever marry you again? He's simply amusing himself with you temporarily! Once the novelty wears off,you'll be absolutely nothing!"

Hannah's expression remained perfectly serene. "Whether he marries me or not, I don't know. But I know with absolute certainty he'll never marry you. Never."

"You!" Erica felt those words pierce straight through her heart,fury consuming every shred of rational thought. Her hand flew
fury consuming every shred of rational thought. Her hand flew up in a vicious arc, aimed directly at Hannah's cheek.

But Hannah moved like lightning, her fingers clamping around Erica's wrist with iron strength. Ice filled her gaze as her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "We're surrounded by witnesses. Control yourself."

Hannah released Erica's trembling hand with deliberate slowness. Then, she checked her watch, a knowing smile ghosting across her features. "Oh, and I'm not without a ride.If my calculations are correct, he should arrive any second."
###Chapter 487 Can You Do
Me Another Favor

Hannah had sent a message to Vincent thirty minutes earlier,telling him to come fetch her.

While her thoughts lingered on that, a black Rolls-Royce Phantom glided effortlessly to a stop in front of the gallery.

The door swung outward, and Vincent, carrying a black umbrella, strode toward the gallery doors.

Hannah's grin widened as she saw his silhouette nearing.She inclined toward Erica, murmuring so only Erica could catch it,"How unbearable it must be-the man you ache for has only ever had eyes for me. Always has been, always will be. You will never have him-not even a glimpse."

"You wretch!" Erica shrieked with a piercing cry, her eyes blazing red as she suddenly lunged forward and shoved Hannah hard."Burn in hell!"

Hannah had foreseen this and allowed herself to collapse backward. She screamed in mock alarm, arranging her fall so she looked messy but took no harm.

Vincent entered precisely in time to see everything unfold. His eyes narrowed instantly as he dashed forward and lifted Hannah from the ground. Then, he pivoted sharply, his stare cutting into Erica, his tone erupting, "What do you think you're doing?"

Erica quivered beneath Vincent's glare, her complexion drained of all color. She flailed her hands wildly. "I barely touched her!She staged the fall on purpose!"

Right then, Danica rushed inside, clutching her umbrella.
Right then, Danica rushed inside, clutching her umbrella."What's going on? Vincent, don't be too harsh on Brinley!Please calm yourself!"

Vincent sliced a cold look at Danica, his tone edged with warning. "Keep her in check!"

He dismissed them and turned his attention to Hannah in his hold, his words tight. "Are you alright? Did you get hurt?"

Hannah knitted her brows slightly, answering feebly, "I think I hurt my backside."

Vincent's features grew grim. He bent down, sliding one arm beneath Hannah's legs and the other around her back, hoisting her securely.

The driver stepped up immediately, raising the umbrella above them.

Hannah curled her arms around Vincent's neck, angling her face to peer past his shoulder, catching Erica's stare. A taunting curve touched her lips as their eyes locked.

Erica staggered, gasping for air as her chest constricted.

Danica steadied her quickly, whispering reassurance, "Brinley,maybe you should give up on Vincent. I despise Hannah as much as you, but Vincent has chosen her. There's nothing I can do."

Erica's gaze clung to their retreating figures. For her to give up on Vincent? No fucking way!

Inside the car, Vincent's brows pressed together."We'll head to the hospital for an examination!"

Hannah straightened,her face settling back to composure. "No need. I was faking it."

Vincent's frown deepened.
Disregarding the flicker of emotion across his expression,Hannah retrieved her phone, swiftly activating the tiny bug she had hidden inside the frame of the painting Erica bought.Within moments, Erica's and Danica's clear voices flowed through her earphones.

Hannah listened carefully, her brows furrowing more as time passed. The dialogue amounted only to complaints, missing the critical clues she wanted.

"Nothing but worthless chatter..." Hannah muttered in dissatisfaction, pulling the earphones away.

When Hannah lifted her head, Vincent's gaze was fixed upon her.

"What is it?" Hannah asked evenly.

Vincent's Adam's apple bobbed slightly. "You used me again."

Hannah held his stare, admitting openly,"Yes."

After a moment's pause, she added, "Could you do me another favor?"

Vincent's forehead creased faintly.

Hannah's eyes locked on him, her tone deliberate. "Try to win Erica over and make her reveal the truth."

Vincent stayed wordless, a chill radiating from him.

"You don't want to? Then forget it!" Hannah shifted quickly."Help me with something else instead. Go home later and tell your grandma not to accept that painting from Erica. Is that okay?"

Vincent offered no reply, his gaze lingering,while silence filled the car.

The vehicle slid quietly into the underground garage of Sterling
The vehicle slid quietly into the underground·garage of Sterling Heights.

Neither spoke during the ride.

Vincent escorted her all the way to her door.

As Hannah entered, Vincent stepped after her, slamming the door shut behind them. Without warning, he seized her wrist,yanking her hard against the door.

Caught unprepared, Hannah was pinned against the wooden panel.

Vincent loomed above her, one hand clamped on her wrist, the other pressed against the door by her ear. He leaned close,his breath searing and edged with fury, as he demanded,"Hannah!How could you say something like that?"
###Chapter 488 | Want You

Hannah tilted her head ever so slightly, her eyes wide with feigned innocence. "What did I say?"

She was playing the fool, pretending not to understand.

"The part where you told me to seduce Erica. Are you trying to push me toward her?" Vincent seized her hand and pressed it against his chest, where his breath rose and fell like storm-tossed waves.

His voice was grave, his gaze unwaveing. "Can't you feel it?My heart is beating only for you!"

Beneath her palm, his chest burned like a furnace, his heartbeat thundering like a war drum.

Hannah's hand was trapped in his firm grasp, impossible to pull away. Her fingertips curled ever so slightly, and for a fleeting instant, a ripple flickered in her eyes-only to vanish, hidden beneath a calm surface.

Looking up, she met his deep stare, and with a playful lilt,she countered, "With your heart racing like that, are you sure it isn't just anger?"

Her words carried a note of mockery, a shield against the truth she refused to face.

"It's your act of ignorance that fuels my anger. You know I love you." Vincent's warm breath brushed her cheek,leaving her no escape.

Back in that hospital room, when she had once placed her hand over his heart, she had already known the truth.

Now, the entryway was wrapped in a silence so heavy that it
Now, the entryway was wrapped in a silence so heavy that it seemed to weigh upon them, broken only by their uneven,hurried breaths.

Hannah kept her silence for a while, her gaze shifting with a tide of emotions before settling into a calm that was bottomless. When she finally spoke, her tone was measured,almost detached. "Vincent, if you had said that line in the first years of our marriage, I would have been overjoyed."

That way, she would not have spent years doubting his love,only to suffer disappointment time after time until their marriage withered.

Vincent's heart sank like a stone in deep water. "And now?"

Hannah met his eyes, her voice flat as a blade. "Now, it means nothing to me."

Even faced with his confession of love, her heart remained unmoved.

To Vincent, it felt as though a dagger had pierced him, pain clouding his eyes. "I've done so much for you, yet you don't see any of it?" His stare searched her face, desperate to find a crack.

But Hannah's eyes stayed steady, unruffled. "It was nothing more than a few meals and a helping hand. Didn't I already thank you?"

She brushed off his efforts as though they were leaves in the wind,carrying no weight.

"I don't want your thanks. I want you!" Vincent's voice rumbled low, like thunder rolling in his chest. He yanked her closer,his fiery chest nearly pressing against hers.

Hannah leaned back a fraction, her lips curling with a teasing smile. "Didn't you already have me not too long ago?"
With her free hand, she traced his tense jawline, her touch both playful and dangerous. Her tone dripped with flirtation, clearly reminding him of their intimacy a few days back.

Vincent froze for a heartbeat, and in that moment she slipped free.

But as she turned, he caught her from behind, his arms locking her in a fierce embrace. His lips hovered close to her ear,burning hot. "Hannah, you know exactly what I mean. Stop pretending!"

Held tight, she could not move. For a moment she was silent,her eyes clouded with thought.

Then, she turned in his arms, her hand rising to caress his cheek gently. "Vincent, do you truly want me?"

Her words came soft as a sigh.

His eyes, unwavering, held no hesitation. "Yes. Only you.Always you."

"Then prove it. Show me your sincerity." Rising slightly on her toes,her lips brushed near his throat.

His Adam's apple bobbed, his body jolting as though struck by lightning."What do you mean?"

Hannah stepped back just enough to breathe, her eyes locked on him. "I want you to win me over! Pursue me with the same fire I once had for you-chase me without restraint, without fear."

Her words struck him hard, his heart trembling under their weight. He swore, "You have my word!"

A smile curved Hannah's lips, deepening like ripples in still water. "But I'm not so easy to claim, not after the woundsI′Vborne."
Her tone grew serious. "So I have two conditions. First, you must be at my side whenever I call. Second, no matter what I do,you mustn't ask why."

Vincent frowned, troubled, but answered with resolve. "P'll do my best."

Hannah nodded with quiet satisfaction and then shifted her gaze. "And as it happens, I do need your help with something."

Suspicion flashed in Vincent's eyes, his voice hard with refusal."Don't even think about asking me to seduce Erica!"

"Why would I ask you that?" Hannah chuckled softly."I asked you to pursue me-how could I possibly want you to seduce her? I'm not willing to share what's mine. Rest assured, it's just a small favor."
###Chapter 489 Behave Yourself And Don't Caus...

Hannah asked Vincent to persuade Sharon not to accept the painting from Erica. Only if Sharon rejected the painting would the bug have its chance.

Vincent agreed without hesitation.

Hannah's eyes brightened with a playful smile as she urged,"You should head over now. If you delay, your grandmother will already be in bed."

Vincent reached the door, then turned back and looked at her."Tomorrow, I'll drive you to work."

Meeting his gaze, Hannah gave a gentle nod."Alright."

It was the very first time she consented to let him take her.Vincent's lips involuntarily curved into a smile.

Meanwhile, in the living room of the Jones family estate,Sharon, wearing her reading glasses, was carefully examining the painting still wrapped with care. Clearly, she had accepted Erica's gift and seemed rather fond of it.

"Grandma." Vincent's voice came from the doorway.

Sharon looked up, and when she saw Vincent, her smile deepened. "Vincent, come and look at this painting Brinley gave me. Isn't it marvelous?"
Vincent cast a glance at it before sitting beside the sofa. "Yes,it is quite nice," he said casually and then shifted his tone with quiet concern. "But Grandma, isn't this painting rather valuable?"

Sharon nodded. "Indeed. Brinley is so thoughtful-she must have spent quite a bit on it."
Vincent's eyes darkened with meaning. "Strange, isn't it? She has no place to turn to and has to live with us. Her employment isn't stable. Where would she find such money?"

And there he stopped.

As matriarch of the Jones family, Sharon surely caught his drift.His words made her realize that accepting the painting so readily was not wise. If the money had come from questionable hands, the Jones family's reputation could be dragged through the mud-and that, above all, she would not allow.

Sharon's smile faded. Her brows drew together, and without a second thought,she ordered a servant to return the painting to "Brinley:"

Vincent lifted his glass, sipping calmly, his expression as steady as a mountain.

Elsewhere,Erica sat before her vanity, a smug smile curling her lips. Sharon liked the painting-of that she was sure. Already,she was weaving dreams of using the gift, along with endless flattery, to win Sharon's trust, anchor herself in the Jones family, and step by step seize everything she believed should be hers.

Then came a knock at the door.

"Who is it?" Erica asked, still in high spirits.

A servant's respectful voice answered from outside, "Miss Gilbert, Mrs. Jones asked me to return the painting to you.She said she's too old to enjoy something so costly and hopes you will keep it yourself."

The smile froze on Erica's face. She leapt up, rushed to the door,and flung it open. In the servant's hands lay the painting she had bought from Hannah at an inflated price,thinking it would please Sharon. Her expression darkened as she snatched it back coldly. How could this be? Returned-just like that?
"Why are you still here?" Erica snapped, her glare sharp, as though the servant were mocking her.

The servant hesitated and then spoke softly. "Mr. Jones asked me to remind you not to send such expensive gifts again. The Jones family lacks nothing. He hopes you'll behave yourself and not cause trouble, and above all, avoid provoking Ms.Scott."

Before the servant finished, Erica slammed the door with a crack of thunder. She hurled the painting aside and began tossing everything within reach. Not a single item on the vanity escaped her fury. A low, guttural growl escaped her throat.Why was Vincent always shielding Hannah? "That wretch!" she spat, cursing furiously.

At the same moment, Hannah, with headphones on, listened closely as Erica's room reverberated with muffled roars. Her own face remained calmn, almost serene. Was Erica truly this enraged simply because her gift had been returned? This was only the first stone cast into the pond.

Erica's troubles were only beginning, and Hannah intended to let them unfold at their own pace.
###Chapter 490 I'll Be Spending The Night With Him

For several weeks, Vincent had made it a habit to appear at the Luminara Group building,personally ferrying Hannah to and from work,rain or shine.

That evening, the car glided smoothly back toward Sterling Heights.

Hannah, gazing at the scenery flashing past the window,suddenly broke the silence. "Do you have any special plans this weekend?"

Vincent cast her a glance. "I might be tied up.Why do you ask?"

He left his words dangling, clearly waiting for her to finish the thought.

Turning her head, Hannah studied the clean lines of his profile,a playful spark flickering in her eyes."Oh, nothing serious.I booked a presidential suite, thinking we could spend some time together. But if you're busy, then forget it."

Her tone carried a trace of disappointment, as if she were letting a balloon slip from her hand.

Vincent felt a sudden stir in his chest, as though something had been gently nudged awake.

He was on the verge of agreeing when Hannah's voice sliced in again, laced with a sigh of helplessness. "I suppose I'll just have to find someone else."

Vincent's smile faltered, freezing in place. Without warning,he braked, bringing the car to a neat stop at the red light. He turned sharply to her. "And who exactly are you planning to
turned sharply to her. "And who exactly are you planning to take to that suite?"

Hannah let out a sly chuckle. "Are you jealous?"

Her question floated back to him as lightly as a feather.

Vincent pressed his lips together, his jawline hardening. He gave no answer.

A heavy silence settled over the car, thick as fog.

Hannah appeared completely unfazed. She shifted her attention away, leisurely fishing out her phone, fingers gliding with ease across the screen.

Vincent tried to disguise his rising fury, stealing what seemed a casual glance at her phone. That one glance made his pupils contract. Her screen displayed photos and videos of striking,handsome young men. Was she seriously picking someone else -and giving it thought?

The last thread of his restraint snapped. He reached out and snatched the phone from her hand. His voice was iron-clad."You can't choose anyone else! l'll go!"

Hannah's lips curved slowly into a triumphant smile. "You're such a darling." Leaning slightly closer, she pressed a feather-light kiss on his cheek. "That's your reward."

The warmth of her lips sent a jolt through him, like a live current racing under his skin. He held his silence, yet the flush in his ears betrayed him.

In the days that followed, Vincent compressed his entire workload into the weekdays, determined to keep the weekend free. The lights in the Jones Group CEO's office burned late into the night.

Meanwhile, Hannah seemed"very busy" herself. For several days straight, Vincent didn't see her at Sterling Heights.
days straight, Vincent didn't see her at·Sterling Heights.Whenever he called, she replied calmly that she was tied up with a project. A blend of disappointment and unease crept over him. But when he thought of their promised weekend,he buriedthe doubts deep down and threw himself into work with renewed resolve.

At last, the weekend came. Vincent rose early, carefully selecting his attire and taking unusual care with his hair,even fastening a new set of cufflinks. A rare smile surfaced as he caught sight of himself in the mirror.

Yet, when he reached for his phone to call Hannah, he couldn't get through. After several failed attempts, the line finally connected."Why didn't you answer?" His voice betrayed a shade of urgency.

On the other end, Hannah sounded languid. "I had Derek deliver the key card to you. Didn't you get it?"

She clearly assumed that was the reason for his call.

"I got it. But where are you? Should I come pick you up?"Vincent presed to the heart of the matter.

Hannah's voice carried a playful complaint. "I'm getting ready for our night. I want to look nice. Is that an issue with you?"

Her faintly coquettish tone melted the tightness in his chest.His voice, unconsciously indulgent, softened. "Of course,it's fine with me. I'll come get you. Just tell me where."

"No need." Her voice was low and enticing. "Meet me at the hotel. Wait for me in the room. I want to surprise you."
Vincent's pulse quickened. She was clearly taking pains for this evening. Without hesitation, he agreed. "Alright. I'lwait for you."

"See you soon." With that, Hannah ended the call.

Hannah set her phone aside and turned her gaze toward Erica,
Hannah set her phone aside and turned her gaze toward Erica,whose eyes burned with undisguised hostility in the mirror. The two of them were seated in a high-end private beauty salon-Hannah's deliberate choice.

Hannah had already known Erica had booked her hair appointment here today. So she had arranged hers at the same time.

The stylist stood stiffly nearby, hardly daring to breathe. The two women-so alike in looks yet worlds apart in bearing-had charged the air with tension from the moment they walked in.

Ignoring Erica's venomous glare, Hannah rose gracefully,adjusting the fall of her dazzling red velvet gown in the mirror.She turned her head just slightly, catching Erica's reflection,and her lips curled into a mocking smile. "Did you hear that?I'll be spending the night with Vincent, just the two of us."
###Chapter 491 Getting The Key Card

Erica pressed her hands into fists, the sharp edges of her nails biting against her skin. Fighting down the storm of envy and fury, she spat out between her teeth, "I already heard you!Don't bother repeating it!"

Hannah gave a faint laugh. "Word is, Sharon dismissed your painting. Such a pity. Tell me, how long do you think you can cling to the Jones family, living off Danica's insignificant sympathy?"

Erica jerked her chin upward, defiance blazing in her gaze."As long as Danica remains, I'll stay as long as I please!"

Hannah leaned closer, her lips almost brushing Erica's ear."Don't be so sure. Once I become Vincent's wife, I'll have the final say in the Jones family. Vincent listens to me! Do you actually believe Danica will still shield you then?"

"You!" Erica's whole body quivered in rage. "Save your boasting until you've truly entered the Jones family! Vincent will never even choose you!"

Straightening with poise, Hannah's smile gleamed brighter."Relax, you'll certainly receive a wedding invitation. After all,without your interference, Vincent and I wouldn't have grown this close so quickly. I owe you my thanks."

Hannah paused slightly, her eyes sweeping across Erica's features-so eerily similar to her own, though now distorted by wrath. With a soft laugh, she added, "I'm done here. Do as you wish.Mimicking others will only make you the object of ridicule."

Gathering her elegant purse, Hannah pivoted with elegance and strode out.
Erica's chest rose and fell violently before she snatched the comb from the table and flung it at the mirror.

The stylist flinched, scarcely daring to breathe.

Later, as the stylist arranged the scattered items, she suddenly gasped,"Oh no! That lady forgot her room key here."

Clutched in the stylist's hand was a gold key card Hannah had "carelessly" left on the vanity, and she began to panic. "What should I do? I don't even have her contact details!"

Erica's eyes instantly locked on the key. Forcing a "kind" smile,she extended her hand toward the stylist. "Give it to me. I know her,and I can return it on her behalf."

The stylist, having overheard their earlier confrontation,believed they were indeed acquainted.

Seeing Erica's face-so uncannily lie Hannah's-the stylist sensed an odd tension but dismissed it. Relieved, she passed the card over. "Thank you very much!"

Erica seized the key, holding it firmly. A dangerous idea sprouted, spreading swiftly through her mind. This was her chance.


Vincent was already waiting inside the presidential suite.He had arranged for the room to be adorned with yellow roses,Hannah's cherished flowers.

"Beep-" The electronic lock clicked open.

Vincent turned eagerly, ready to greet the woman dearest to him. But the figure stepping inside froze his smile instantly. It was Erica, not Hannah!

"Why are you here?" Vincent's tone cut like ice, his presence exuding menace. "What have you done to Hannah?"
Erica's pulse stumbled under his penetrating stare. Still, she smothered her dread, striving to appear steady. She even curved her lips into a smile-an imitation of Hannah's detached elegance. "What are you talking about? I am Hannah."

"Stop pretending." Vincent's expression revealed unhidden contempt.

Erica's eyes flickered, sweeping over the sea of bright yellow roses, jealousy flooding her chest. She approached the table,plucked a bloom, and lifted it to her face, feigning delight in its fragrance. "You remembered my fondness for roses, how sweet of you."

"Put that down! It wasn't meant for you." Vincent's tone was cutting. His eyes turned glacial. "Leave at once, or I'll call security!"

He drew out his phone, his thumb poised above the call button.

Erica's mask finally fractured completely. She hurled the rose to the floor, her voice contorted with wild fury. "Why? Even though I look exactly like Hannah, wy can you tell the difference? Why do you see only her? What does she have that I lack?"

Her composure collapsed, sobs wracking her body, streaks of makeup running down her tear-stained cheeks.

Vincent's gaze remained frigid, untouched by sympathy,weighted only with disdain. "I won't repeat myself. Get out."

The final thread of Erica's sanity snapped. Darkness overtook her entirely. She jerked her head up, a twisted smile distorting her face. "Do you want to know what happened to Hannah?Fine-I killed her! You'll never lay eyes on her again."
###Chapter 492 Steal My Boyfriend

Vincent felt a sharp jolt in his chest, as though his very heart had been pierced by a blade. In an instant, he lunged forward,clamping Erica's throat in his grip. His voice was hoarse with fury, like thunder muffled in a storm. "If anything happens to Hannah,you'll go down with her! Now speak-where is she?"

Erica's breath faltered beneath his hold, her face shifting from red to purple as air abandoned her lungs. And yet, when her eyes met the tempest of anguish and madness blazing in Vincent's gaze-madness boorn for Hannah-twisted satisfaction bloomed inside her like a poisonous flower.

With the last scraps of strength, Erica curved her lips into a crooked smile. Her voice rasped and cracked. "Ha... You'll never see her again. From today, only I will wear this face..."

Vincent's expression darkened. She had already stepped across the line where reason ends. At this moment, the priority was to send people to find Hannah.

Vincent's bloodshot eyes burned into her before, at last, he let go. Erica collapsed to the floor, hacking violently, sucking in air as though each breath were borrowed time.

He did not spare her a second glance. Snatching his phone, his tone cut like sharpened steel. "Find Hannah! Mobilize everyone -search high and low. I don't care what it takes. Just find her.Now!"

On the other end, Derek froze at the desperation in V/incent's voice, his tone edged with disbelief. "Mr. Jones, isn't Ms. Scott supposed to meet you at the hotel? What's going on?"

"No questions. Just find her!" Vincent snapped, ending the call
No questions. Just find her!" Vincent snapped,ending the call abruptly.

His bloodshot gaze fell on Erica again, sprawled on the floor,her lips twisted into a smug smile. The look he gave her was like he was gazing at a corpse rather than a living being.

She savored the bitterness of her revenge. Struggling upright,she let her words drip like poison. "Look at you-so frantic, so lost. I've hidden Hannah well. You'll never see her again. Unless


Her cracked lips curled as madness flickered in her eyes. "If you hold me close tonight, the way you would do to Hannah,I might just tell you where she is."

Every word was a deliberate trap. She hadn't actually sent anyone after Hannah. All this scheming was meant to rattle Vincent-corner him into intimacy so that, when Hannah returned, she would stumble into the perfect scene of betrayal.

But Vincent's fury was colder than stone. "Threaten me? You're not qualified!" His voice carried the chill of final judgment.

He reached for his phone again, prepared to order his men to restrain Erica.

Just then, the door creaked open. For a heartbeat, his pulse leapt-he thought it was Hannah. He was about to rush forward when,instead,a crowd poured in. To be exact, it was a pack of reporters. They surged into the room with hungry eagerness,cameras flashing and microphones thrust forward.

Meanwhile, Hannah lingered in the shadows of the corner,silently drinking in the spectacle before her. She had, with careful intent, left her room card behind for Erica to discover.And as expected, Erica had swallowed the bait whole.

The reporters, too, had been summoned by Hannah to immortalize this very moment. Now, the stage was set, and it was her cue to step forward.

Feigning bewilderment, Hannah's voice floated from the edge of the press crowd. "Why are there so many people here?"

The noisy swarm of reporters stilled for a heartbeat, then parted like the Red Sea to clear a path for her.

Hannah entered with steady composure. Her gaze traveled across the chaos, before fixing sharply on Erica-pale, shaken,and slumped on the floor. With a furrowed brow, she demanded, "Brinley? What exactly are you doing here with my boyfriend?"

Vincent's heart, stretched taut with fear, finally eased when Hannah appeared unharmed before his eyes. A wave of relief engulfed him. And yet, almost at once, suspicion crept in its wake.Why had she chosen this exact moment to appear-right as the reporters stormed in, when the scene brimmed with scandal? Was it mere chance, or a plan too neat to be dismissed?

Erica's thoughts scattered like dust in the wind as she watched Hannah effortlessly seize command of both the room and the reporters.

In the next breath, chaos exploded. The cameras crackled,shutters snapping wildly as they captured the uncanny sight of two women, mirror images of each other, in the same room.

"Oh my God! Two women,identical!"

"Is Mr. Jones entangled with twins? No-one is real, the other a counterfeit!"

"Who's the mistress? This is a scandal straight from a stage play! Keep filming!"

Hannah paid no mind to the flashing lights or the whispers swirling around her. Taking a deliberate step forward,her eyes brimmed with calculated disbelief, her voice pitched to carry through the crowd. "Brinley, it's one thing to alter your face to
through the crowd. "Brinley, it's one thing to alter your face to look like mine, but now you dare to steal my boyfriend? You even turn up in the suite he reserved? What's next? Did you swipe my room card so you could crawl into my boyfriend's bed while wearing my face?"
###Chapter 493 You Set This Up

Hannah drew in a long, dramatic breath, her expression dripping with mock sorrow as she gazed at Erica. "Vincent never gave a damn about you! Why the hell are you still hanging off him like a leech? Doesn't it feel pathetic?"

The crowd of reporters erupted, microphones flashing toward Erica.

"This is front-page material! A woman, madly in love, went under the knife to look like her rival, and the CEO still turned her away. Absolutely deranged! Her brain's gotta be scrambled beyond repair!"

"I can't help but wonder what her real face looked like before.What kind of person willingly carves themselves into someone else's image? Doesn't it creep her out every time she looks in the mirror?"

"Haven't you heard? She only did it to steal Mr. Jones!Thought she could claw her way up by changing her face,but it backfired-now she's sneaking into his bed with a stolen room key!"

The flood of malicious gossip slammed into Erica, each word like another stone thrown. Camera flashes burst in her eyes,capturing her disgrace in cruel, frozen fragments.

Erica's hands balled into fists, nails biting into her skin until they drew blood. She jerked her head up, fury blazing in her gaze as it landed on Hannah's too-sweet smile. All the fragments fused into a clear picture in her head. The room key, the swarm of reporters, the perfect timing-it all snapped into place. This wasn't bad luck-it was Hannah's damn scheme. Hannah had dropped the key deliberately, lured her into the snare, and
dropped the key deliberately, lured her into the snare, and planted the waiting reporters-every detail designed to destroy her.

"It's you!" Erica sprang upright, her whole bodytrembling as she jabbed a finger at Hannah. Her voice sliced through the clamor, shrill with rage. "You set me up-you wanted me destroyed, you conniving bitch!"

Vincent's gaze stayed flat and unreadable, his silence heavy as stone.

Hannah met Erica's fury with a calm tilt of her chin, her eyes sharp. Her voice rang out, steady and deliberate. "How could you say that? Did I force you to alter your face into mine with countless plastic surgeries? Did I make you go crawling after my boyfriend? Did I push you to check into a hotel room with him?"

Her words cut through the air lie glass. She let the silence hang just long enough and then swept her gaze across the ring of reporters, every eye glued to her. When she spoke again,her voice was low, deliberate, and edged with frost."Watch your tongue. Without evidence, what you're spouting is slander -and the fallout won't land on me."

The chill in Hannah's retort lit the press like a spark to tinder.

Reporters pounced on Erica at once, their voices colliding in a chaotic storm.

"Do you have proof that Ms. Scott set you up?"

"Did you really undergo plastic surgeries to look like her just to get close to Mr. Jones? Weren't your intentions manipulative from the start?"

Microphones pressed in from every angle, cameras flashing mercilessly as the questions grew sharper, more merciless with each passing second,leaving Erica nowhere to breathe.

Erica stumbled backward, shoving at shoulders and arms in a
Erica stumbled backward, shoving at shoulders and arms in a frantic attempt to carve out an escape.

The reporters only pressed in tighter, their cameras flashing,their questions cutting off every direction she turned.

A bold reporter, unwilling to relent, even lunged toward Vincent with his microphone.

Vincent's cold eyes swept over them like a blade, a silent warning that froze that bold reporter mid-stride and sent him instinctively retreating.

Without wasting another second, Vincent clamped his hand around Hannah's wrist and pulled her forward. His stride was sharp, deliberate, slicing through the mob as he dragged her toward the elevator.

Though Hannah staggered under his force, her expression stayed unnervingly composed, her lips curving with the faintest hint of control.

Right before they stepped into the waiting elevator, she turned her head.Through the chaos, her gaze pinned Erica, who was still trapped in the reporters' ring. The shadow of a smile flickered at the edge of her mouth. Erica had brought this downfall on herself.

With the gossip surging like wildfire, the scandal over Erica's plastic surgery would soon detonate, and once someone traced it back to the clinic where she had gotten her procedure, there would be no denying her true identity.

That certainty hardened Hannah's gaze, leaving her eyes like shards of ice.

The elevator continued its descent, the metallic hum echoing in the tense silence.

Vincent's hand clamped firmly around Hannah's wrist, his grip unrelenting.
Hannah could hear the ragged cadence of his breathing-harsh,restrained, but betraying the storm beneath his calm exterior.

The moment the doors opened on the ground floor, he kept his silence, hauling her through the sprawling, vacant lobby toward the waiting vehicle.

Hannah slipped into the passenger seat, yet he made no move to start the engine. His hand, still clamped around her wrist,refused to let go.

Only when the pressure became unbearable did Hannah twist free with a sharp tug.

A heavy silence settled over the car, stretching thin between them.

Breath ragged and chest heaving, Vincent finally turned toward her, his stare unflinching. "What's wrong? Why so quiet now?Funny how you never shut up when the reporters were there."
###Chapter 494 You Don't Belong To Me

Hannah studied Vincent's face, forcing lightness into her voice."So, where shall we head next? Perhaps we could find somewhere to eat? I'm actually quite hungry."

Vincent's stare pierced through her like a blade. "That's your response? After everything that just unfolded back there, food is what occupies your thoughts?"

Hannah held his blazing gaze without flinching. "What else do you expect me to say? The matter is concluded, isn't it?"

Vincent nearly erupted with bitter laughter at her casual dismissal. He planted his hands on either side of her seat,trapping her completely. "You dragged me into your elaborate game today, manipulated me like some chess piece, exploited every ounce of trust I offered you-and now you believe you can simply wave it all away? Just casually suggest we 'find somewhere to eat' and pretend nothing happened?"

Hannah's composure wavered for just an instant before settling back into place. She averted her gaze, her tone growing distant. "Game? I don't follow. You're seething with anger right now,too agitated for rational thought. We both need space to regain our composure."

She moved to unfasten her seatbelt, preparing to exit the vehicle.

"You're not walking away!" Vincent's fingers closed around her wrist like a vise, leaning even closer. "Look at me! Wasn't today all a setup for Erica? You planned every detail from the instant you suggested this weekend outing, didn't you? You exploited my emotions, my vulnerability, and turned me into the perfect weapon for your revenge plot, didn't you?"

Hannah found herself pinned beneath his scorching gaze, his grip cutting painfully into her delicate wrist.

Silence stretched between them for several heartbeats, her lashes trembling almost imperceptibly. "Yes. It was absolutely my scheme-calculated from the very instant I suggested this outing."

She abandoned all pretense. "But you care for me, don't you?Why are you so unwilling to do me this small favor? You lost nothing in the process-merely played your part alongside me.I achieved what I wanted... I was happy... Weren't you?"

Her tone suggested she was discussing something perfectly ordinary, utterly inconsequential.

Crushing disappointment and rage swirled in Vincent's dark eyes. "If you intended to orchestrate this entire charade,couldn't you have at least confided in me? Do you have any idea how much I valued today? I crammed every ounce of work into weekdays, burned through countless late nights-all to free this single day for you. And what about you? Nothing but deception! Did my feelings ever cross your mind?"

Witnessing the rawv anguish in his expression, Hannah felt something sharp pierce her chest. She turned away, her voice dropping to barely above a whisper. "Can't we simply consider what transpired a minor detour? There's still plenty of time-we can still go on our date."

She was deflecting desperately, attempting to salvage the situation by proposing they proceed with their date.

Vincent watched her frantic efforts to dismiss everything, his fury gradually dissolving into profound exhaustion. He released her wrist and sank back against the leather seat, weariness coating every word. "You're missing the entire point. What l crave is transparency-genuine openness between us. I need you to understand that I'll always stand in your corner.Whatever battles you choose to fight, I'll support you
Whatever battles you choose to fight, I'll support you completely. But you consistently keep shutting me out."

Hannah maintained her silence, her gaze fixed on the world beyond the glass.

Vincent shifted toward her, his eyes searching hers as he spoke with deliberate care. "The next time you devise a strategy,will you include me in the conversation rather than treating me like some chess piece you can manipulate at your convenience?"

After an extended pause, Hannah finally broke her silence."I apologize... I did exploit you. But... "

Her tone transformed as she locked eyes with him. "I cannot bring myself to share everything with you at this moment.These are personal vendettas, private wars I must wage alone.There's no reason to entangle you in such darkness. You don't belong to me."

Her frigid, detached declaration cut through Vincent's chest like a blade, flooding him with overwhelming despair and powerlessness. He turned away wordlessly, directing his attention back toward the window, offering no response.

Hannah observed his rigid, silent silhouette, complex emotions stirring within her chest. She shifted closer, her voice growing uncertain. "Didn't we establish boundaries earlier? No questions asked, yet you persist in your interrogations."

He remained silent.

She leaned even nearer, pressing a gentle kiss against his firmly sealed lips. "Stop overthinking. Isn't what we have now good enough?"
###Chapter 495 A Naked Invitation
Hannah tried to ease the tension with a kiss.

The sudden trill of Vincent's phone shattered the fragile quiet inside the car. Derek's name flashed across the screen.

Vincent answered without hesitation. "Speak."

On the other end, Derek's voice rushed out, tight with urgency."Mr. Jones, we've searched everywhere Ms. Scott might have gone-her office, her apartment, even the clubs she usually visits-but she's nowhere! Her phone's been off this whole time.Do you want me to involve the police?"

Hannah caught every word. For a heartbeat, she sat frozen,breath caught in her throat. In that moment, everything clicked into place. Vincent's earlier fury hadn't just come from pride or suspicion-it had been the panic from the assumpotion that she was in danger. He had mobilized everyone, desperately scouring the city for her.

Her gaze lifted to Vincent, eyes wide with astonishment, a faint tremor of emotion rippling across her face.

Vincent held the phone in a tense grip, his voice low and worn."Don't bother. She's with me now, and she's not in any danger."

Relief rushed through Derek's reply. "Understood, Mr. Jones!"

The line went dead, and the car sank back into silence.

Warm,tangled emotions welled up in Hannah's chest."50you were worried about me," she remarked, her eyes glinting with quiet satisfaction.

Vincent kept his gaze fixed ahead, his tone flat and restrained
Vincent kept his gaze fixed ahead, his tone flat and restrained."I'll drive you back."

He was about to turn the key when Hannah's hand slid over and caught his, halting him.

Her eyes lingered on the sharp lines of his face,a reckless spark igniting inside her. "Don't take me back yet," she insisted.

With a flicker of confusion in his eyes, he glanced her way.

Hannah met his eyes and then leaned forward, pressing her lips to his with sudden heat. She pressed her palm against his chest,tugging wildly at the buttons as if every layer between them was unbearable.

"Let's do it here," she murmured, her voice husky, carrying a raw and deliberate invitation.

Vincent's shoulders went rigid, his whole frame tense. He didn't return the kiss, nor did he stop her wandering hand as it worked at his shirt buttons.

But by the time she reached the second one, he caught her wrist, his grip steady but unyielding, and pushed her gently aside.

Bewilderment flashed across Hannah's gaze as she studied him.

Without meeting her gaze, Vincent turned the key in the ignition and the engine hummed to life. "Let's head back," he said flatly.

Hannah's breath caught, her shock edged with rage. Had he just rejected her?

The car rolled away in smooth silence, carrying them back toward Sterling Heights.

Neither of them spoke for the entire drive.

They stepped out into the hallway together and made their
They stepped out into the hallway together and made their way to the elevator, walking shoulder to shoulder.
The elevator climbed smoothly, numbers flickering upward one after another.
He strode out first, pressed his finger to the lock, and pushed the door open without so much as a glance back.

"Not planning to head home?" His voice carried a sharp edge as he leaned against the frame, blocking her way.

"Just came to hang out at your place. Am I not welcome?" She tilted her chin, slipped neatly beneath his arm, and crossed the doorway.

"You're not worried I might keep you here?" he remarked, the door clicking shut behind them.

"Worried? Not a bit." She turned toward him, lips curved in a teasing smile, her gaze lingering boldly on him. "What are you gonna do,tear me apart?"

His gaze broke away from hers, and he strode to the island in the open kitchen, filled a glass with ice water, and drained most of it in one breath as if the chill could smother the blaze pounding in his chest.

The liquid slid past his parched lips and down the sharp line of his throat, his Adam's apple shifting with every swallow.

"Tour's done. Go home." He set the glass down with a flat clink,his voice still cutting.

She didn't back away. Instead, she stepped closer, her gaze lingering on the damp corner of his mouth. "Did it taste good?"

His lips pressed into a thin line, silence his only answer.

"Then maybe I'll try it for myself." Before he could move, she rose on tiptoe, her tongue flicking across the droplets clinging
)
rose on tiptoe, her tongue flicking across the droplets clinging to his lips.

A surge of heat ripped through him, crackling down his spine like raw voltage.

He recoiled a step, chest tight with conflict and then strode to the sofa and dropped onto it, putting as much space between them as the room allowed. "What are you playing at?"

"I'm trying to soothe you. Didn't you feel it?" She closed the distance between them, stopping just before him.

"No need." He angled his head away, refusing to meet her burning stare. "Weren't you the one who told me to calm down?Then leave."

"I wasn't thinking straight earlier," she murmured, her voice dropping low.

A sharp, icy chuckle slipped from him as he shot back.′′nsuddenly you've regained clarity?"

She faltered for a moment and then the unexpected question spilled out. "Did you send Derek to locate me because you thought something had happened to me?"

He jerked his head up, eyes blazing like a tempest of shadows."What do you think? Erica strolled into your suite with your keycard-how the hell was I supposed to stay calm?"

Even recalling it made the bones in his fists creak from the pressure.

Bracing her palms against the back of the sofa, she bent closer,their breaths tangling in the narrow space."So you really were that worried?"

His throat bobbed hard, but he kept his silence, jaw locked in place, carrying a rigid edge, as he turned away again.
Without hesitation, she shifted into his lap, settling over him with deliberate intent.

Her body pressed against his, every inchof him locking up as blood pounded to his head. "Get off!" he hissed through clenched teeth.
###Chapter 496 Kiss You

Hannah looped her arms behind Vincent's neck, defiance shimmering in her gaze. "I won't get off."

"If you refuse, I'll be forced to rob you of a kiss!" Vincent warned, his stare predatory.

"And how are you certain I feel like kissing you right now?" She laughed softly, lowering herself to capture his lips wvith gentle intent.

She pried his lips apart without hesitation.

He stiffened briefly and then pressed firmly on her shoulders to shove her away. His breathing faltered, annoyance rising "What game are you playing?!"

"Kiss you." Her eyes were misty with longing as she leaned forward once again, unshaken.

This time, his frame braced with expectation. He commanded himself to stay unmoved, to appear detached. His hand,hanging loosely at his side, coiled into a fist, veins ridging across the back.

Until her cool fingers closed around his tightened fist, guiding it,clasp by clasp, to unfasten her silk blouse, his final trace of restraint dissolved entirely.

All his composure and control were scattered like ashes. The last spark of clarity in his gaze drowned beneath a flood of want. He kissed her with unrestrained force.

He ceased being still, meeting her with consuming fervor. His tongue drove in harshly, robbing her of breath, his broad palm cradling her head, forbidding escape.
He abruptly rolled her beneath him, pinning her into the plush couch. Their bodies pressed close. The warmth of their skin burned through the thin fabric.

The kiss flared hotter and deeper.

He lifted her into his arms, intending to take her to the bedroom. But she clung to him tightly, her eyes faintly reddened. "Let's do it here."

She couldn't suppress it anymore. For the first time since their divorce, she'd unleashed her desires without caution. It was likewise the first moment she realized being fussed over and cared for wasn't unpleasant. She even savored it faintly.

Vincent answered her directly with his deeds. He sealed her mouth again, claiming her with reckless hunger.

The couch ended up in disarray. They forgot time completely,their final memory of Hannah lingering in the bathroom.

She had meant to stop, but Vincent insisted on taking her inside.

At dawn, she awoke, her body sore and strangely tender.

Vincent had risen earlier. He had prepared breakfast for them both.

She entered the dining room, noting his ever-serious expression. "You're still upset," she said as she sat down.

Vincent simply slid a small piece of omelet onto her plate, his tone flat. "Eat first."

The room lapsed into silence once more.

He finished swiftly, then waited for her to end her meal quietly.

After a while, his calm gaze fixed on her. "Are you finished eating?"
"Yes," she responded, holding his eyes.

He leaned back against the chair, fingers interlaced on the table, prepared for a serious talk. "I sayed awake all night,focused on one matter."

Her fingertips tightened slightly.

Vincent studied her, missing no flicker of change on her face."Last night, you started everything. You came with me, kept provoking me. Why?"

Her tone remained airy. "I was trying to appease you."

"Why the sudden urge to appease me?" he pressed, refusing to let her evade.

A faint gleam of amusement touched her eyes. "Because I figured, as a pursuer, you're not terrible."

He leaned closer, elbows resting forward on the table,narrowing the space between them. "In the future, if something occurs, if you plan something,will you tell me?"

He added after a short pause, "I don't want a repeat of last night."

She lowered her eyes, absently pushing at her food with a fork,quiet for a spell. "I'll try," she whispered gently. She was accustomed to deciding and acting alone. Abruptly needing to explain her movements and reasons to another person required adjustment.

He saw her reluctance. He decided to yield slightly but marked his boundary. "Alright. You don't need to inform me of everything. I only want to know if a date is involved in your plan, so I should know ahead of time. Because I don't like the feeling of being let down."

Hannah's lips curved faintly, trying to lighten the heavy mood."But I had already made it up to you last night. Even though it
"But I had already made it up to you last night. Even though it wasn't the hotel we arranged, you still enjoyed yourself,didn't you?"

He scowled. "That's not the same."

"Why not? Is the hotel more thrilling?" She cocked her head,her gaze trailing across his features. "Then we can attempt it next time."

He regarded her in silence.

She chuckled softly, pressing on. "Or do you prefer it at home?"

He lifted the glass from the table, drank slowly, his Adam's apple shifting. After a stretch, as though he'd pondered carefully, he replied in a low voice,"We can try."

Her face brightened with satisfaction.

He rose, beginning to clear the dishes wordlessly.

She,however, moved into the living room,pulling a small white pill bottle from her purse left on the couch.

He finished tidying up quickly, ready to take her to the office.As he stepped into the living room, he caught her tipping her head back, swallowing several pills. There had been no condoms in the house the night before, and they hadn't taken precautions.

Vincent's face clouded dark instantly. He strode forward,snatched the white bottle from her grasp, his tone frigid as steel. "Why are you taking contracepotive pills again?"
###Chapter 497| Can't Conceive

Hannah stiffened briefly, startled by Vincent's sudden outburst and rough movements. She replied evenly, "These aren't birth control pils."

Only at that point did Vincent calm down a bit, lowering his gaze to inspect the bottle clutched in his hand-it was vitamins.His rigid frame eased faintly, yet his voice stayed sharp. "Still,don't take birth control pills."

Fixing his stare on hers, he stressed each syllable. "If a child exists, you'll deliver it.I'll accept responsibility."

Hannah took the bottle back, her voice light. "Calm down.I won't use birth control pills."

He studied her composed, steady expression, assuming it signaled a new silent accord, proof their bond was progressing.His severe features softened, his taut nerves loosening,and he was ready to suggest driving her to work.

Yet before he could, she remarked softly, "Because I can't conceive."

The room froze,

Every gesture, everyline of Vincent's face turned stiff. It was as if the words had passed unheard, and at once as if they had slammed directly into him-his breath faltered. His pupils contracted as he searched her eerily placid features, hunting for even the faintest sign of mockery or malice.

After a long silence, he forced out sound from deep within,his tone nearly cracking. "What did you just say?"

Hannah averted her gaze, her voice calm as though naming something minor. "Exactly what it sounds like."

She paused, her lashes quivering faintly, then added, "I was pregnant once. During the miscarriage, the bleeding was so severe that the doctors declared my uterus too damaged-l can never conceive again."

"You miscarried?" Vincent lunged forward suddenly, his voice trembling. "When did that happen? Why didn't I know? Why hide it from me?"

Hannah finally turned toward him, a faint smile curving her lips."Do you truly think I never tried to tell you? Back then, you never gave me the chance, did you?"

Those wounds hidden by time, though never closed,seemed to tear wide again, spilling raw pain.

She drew a steadying breath. "Even the day I miscarried-when the bleeding began suddenly and terror shook me-I dialed you twenty-nine times, and not a single one connected."

Vincent's chest tightened. He recalled those twenty-nine calls.At the time, he had been overseas, consumed by a critical merger,rushing between unending conferences under crushing demands. When he noticed calls from her, he'd assumed they were trivial, even despised her for disturbing him at such a vital stage-and dismissed them repeatedly in annoyance.

When the calls kept coming, unsettlig him to the core, he'd even powered his phone off. When the deal concluded and he switched it back on, the twenty-nine missed calls had stirred a flicker of unease, but it had drowned quickly in endless banquets and obligations.

He'd only called back once. When she failed to answer, he'd dismissed it, assuming she was pouting.

He'd never considered that, at that moment, she was enduring
He'd never considered that, at that moment, she was enduring such torment alone. A surge of shame and regret clamped around his heart like an unseen grip, suffocating every breath.He was nothing but a bastard. A complete piece of trash.

"I'm sorry." Of all the words available, only those three surfaced-feeble,hollow, and far too late.

A faint curve brushed Hannah's mouth, though her eyes remained cold. "Not being able to conceive isn't such a great burden,honestly. For me, everything-pleasant or painful-I've already made peace with."

Vincent's stare was a storm of turmoil-shock, guilt, and deep sorrow.

Hannah shifted uneasily beneath his heavy gaze. Reflexively,she braced herself, covering it with a joking tone to shatter the oppressive air. "Why keep watching me like that? Want another round?"

Vincent abruptly seized her slender fingers, clasping them tightly in his grip. His eyes glistened with anguish and regret."I mean it-I'm truly sorry."

Hannah tore her hand back, her voice turning frosty,sharp with unmistakable detachment. "Enough. Honestly, Vincent, your apology now is meaningless. I can't return to the woman I was then, whisper'it's fine'-and accept it."
###Chapter 498 Something's Going On

Vincent swallowed hard, his Adam's apple jerking with the effort, the weight of unspoken words burning in his chest.

In a sudden surge, he stepped in and crushed her against him,his arms unyielding. "I'm sorry." His face sank into the curve of her neck, his breath hot against her skin, his voice low and ragged. "I had no idea how much you carried alone. If I'd realized earlier..."

If he had known, he would never have missed that call, never would have been absent when she needed him most, never would have let his pride twist them apart until divorce papers sat between them. He wished he could go back and beat that reckless, arrogant version of himself out into the open and beat him to death.

Hannah stiffened in his arms, a flash of resistance trembling through her. Yet she didn't push him away. She felt the faint quiver of remorse trembling through his hold. It wasn't a performance.It was real.

After a long while, they pulled themselves together, smoothing out their disheveled clothes before heading off. Vincent slid behind the wheel and personally drove Hannah back to her company.

The gleaming car-and the magnetic man at the helm-once again drew hushed gasps and sidelong stares from the receptionists and early staffers.

"Did you catch that? Ms. Scott's been getting out of that same car again. It's been going on for close to half a month,hasn't it?There's no way it's just coincidence."

"I heard a rumor-supposedly the one chasing after her is the head of Jones Group himself!"

"No way, Vincent Jones? That's insane! He looks even more striking in person than in those glossy magazine spreads."

Hannah strode into the building with practiced composure,letting the waves of gossip and curious stares roll off her back.Her spine stayed perfectly straight as she stepped into her private elevator and rose smoothly to her top-floor office.

At her desk, she sank into the chair, only to find her thoughts drifting-Vincent's warmth still ghosting against her shoulder like a memory she couldn't quite shake. With a brisk shake of her head, she forced the haze away and buried herself in work,tackling several urgent documents in quick succession.

When the last file was closed, habit pulled her cursor to a news site. Just as expected, Erica's name had already shot onto the trending list. The internet's reach was merciless; rumor and speculation spilled out in endless streams, netizens gleefully digging through her trail of "new faces" and guessing which clinics had crafted them.

Hannah read with cool precision, her eyes slicing through the articles as she marked out the hospitals and directors most frequently named-the ones drowning in suspicion. She lifted her phone, compiled the essentials into a terse message, and sent it off:"Mr. Jones, with your connections, can you dig*into this for me?"

Vincent's reply came almost instantly. "Already checked the top three-messy backgrounds, but nothing solid on Erica.I'll have my people comb through the rest right away."

Her response was brief. "Appreciate it."

He sent back a curt acknowledgment."Mm."

That should have ended the exchange, but his next message
That should have ended the exchange, but his next message flashed across her screen."I've arranged some supplements for you-sent to both your office and your place,"

Her brows knitted at the sudden shift. She tapped out a single word."What?"

As if on cue, her assistant slipped into the office carrying several ornate gift boxes. One by one, they were set on the coffee table in the lounge area until the corner looked as though it belonged to a boutique shop.

With steady steps, she approached the boxes and flipped them open,revealing high-end items-collagen powder,royal jelly,cranberry extract, plus imported vitamins and herbal blends all marketed for women's health.

With a practiced flick, her phone caught the image and fired it off to Vincent. "Mr. Jones, are you planning to ditch finance and start a health-supplement business?"

His call came through almost instantly. "These are all good for women-nourishing. Make sure you take those regularly."

Lifting the cranberry extract, Hannah rolled the jar between her palms, her tone even. "What made you put all of this together out of nowhere?"

For several seconds the line stayed quiet, then his deep voice finally broke through. "All I wanted was to help you regain your strength."

Hannah caught the weight beneath his words, recognizing his underlying concern. She chose not to point it out and only replied lightly, "Alright then. Thanks."

After a short stretch of casual talk, she put the phone down.Her gaze fell on the stack of items, and a weight pressed down on her chest, nameless yet suffocating.

When work finally wrapped, Vincent's car was already waiting
When work finally wrapped, Vincent's car was already waiting by the curb.

Sliding into the passenger seat, Hannah casually mentioned a restaurant.

Instead of following her lead, Vincent steered the car elsewhere.

Familiar streets slipped past the window in the wrong order,making her brows knit. She turned, puzzled. "This isn't the way I told you. Weren't we going out to eat? Where exactly are you taking me?"
###Chapter 499 Full Check-up

Vincent's hands flexed tighter on the wheel, his knuckles pale against the leather. He kept his gaze fixed on the road, his tone steady but clipped. "We're not going to dinner. I have somewhere else I need to take you."

When the car rolled to a stop in front of the city's most exclusive private hospital, Hannah's expression darkened. She lingered in her seat, sharp eyes cutting toward him. "And you decided to drag me to a hospital without saying a word?"

Unclipping his seatbelt, Vincent froze briefly under her stare before trying to soften his voice. "Don't overthink it. I only booked a full exam for you. VIP service-it'll be quick."

Her brows arched, her voice cool and unreadable."A check-up?What exactly are they planning to check?"

His gaze locked on her, raw concern flickering in his eyes."I read up on it. A miscarriage-especially with heavy blood loss -can leave hidden damage. Recovery isn't just rest; it needs ongoing monitoring. I just want to be sure you're truly alright."

Hannah held his gaze for a long ten seconds, her silence heavy before she finally spoke. "A check-up is fine. But tell me honestly-did you bring me here because you don't believe what I told you yesterday? You think I just made up the part about not being able to have kids?"

"Absolutely not!" Vincent's voice broke out, urgent and raw. "I never once doubted you. What I regret is not standing beside you when you needed me most, leaving you to shoulder it all alone. All I want now is to make it right-to do whatever I can to keep you healthy. It's not about trust in you. It's about the harm I caused your condition back then."

The explanation spilled from him without hesitation, his eyes bright with worry, the tension in his features betraying just how real his concern was.

Hannah's expression softened only slightly, though her words carried an edge. "Vincent, good intentions or not, you should've spoken to me first. You don't get to blindside me and haul me into a hospital. I'm not something you own. Only I get to decide when my body needs care."

Vincent lowered his head and admitted quickly, "You're absolutely right. I was rash, overbearing, and I didn't consider your feelings. I promise it won't happen again."

His apology came out careful and sincere, almost tentative.

"See that it doesn't repeat," Hannah said at last, relenting as she pushed the door open and stepped out.

The VIP service lived up to its name: a team of doctors and nurses awaited her arrival, moving her smoothly through a private series of tests that were both thorough and efficient.

The final report confirmed Hannah's body was in good shape.Other than a stretch of fatigue and some mild sub-health signs,nothing serious showed up.

Vincent, however, still couldn't rest easy. With the report clutched in his hand, he leaned toward the doctor. "She went through a miscarriage before, with heavy bleeding. Could that leave lingering damage? What should I be careful about? Will she need any particular kind of care?"

The doctor pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and spoke with calm certainty."Mr. Jones, the tests indicate Mrs.Jones has recovered very well. That procedure didn't leave behind any lasting health risks. There's truly no need for you to worry."

Vincent finally let out a long breath, shoulders easing as the

Vincent finally let out a long breath, shoulders easing as the tension slipped away.

The doctor, catching his unease, gave a teasing smile. "Funny,it's usually the wife who's more nervous. Don't stress-medicine's advanced a lot. Having trouble conceiving doesn't mean it's hopeless-IVF is always an option if it comes to that ..."

Hannah's cool voice cut across his words. "We're not married."

Almost overlapping her tone, Vincent replied with calm certainty, "We will be." His gaze locked on hers, unwavering,almost like a vow etched in silence.

Then, turning back to the doctor, Vincent added firmly, "If children aren't part of our future, then so be it. What matters most is her health."

The doctor faltered for a heartbeat before offering a smile and dropping the subject.

They left the consultation room together, their footsteps echoing down the wide VIP corridor, faintly perfumed with disinfectant.

Partway along, Hannah came to an abrupt stop and looked up at Vincent, her expression tangled with unspoken thoughts."Vincent, I remember how much you used to love kids."

The memory rushed back to her clearly. Once upon a time,when they still dreamed of a family, he had cradled a friend's little girl with such tender care, saying he wanted a daughter just as sweet and beautiful, that nothing could make him happier.

Vincent halted in his tracks and swung around to meet her eyes.His voice came low but unshakably firm. "That was in the past.Now, and from here on, the only one I care about is you.Hannah, whether we ever have children or not, it changes nothing. You are all that matters."
###Chapter 500 Let's End This

Hannah's eyes flickered with surprise and doubt. "You really don't want children?"

Vincent's answer came without pause. "No."

Her breath hitched, caught off guard by/his blunt certainty.She frowned,pressing the reality he couldn't sidestep. "But the Jones Group-it needs an heir. It's a massive empire..."

Vincent cut her off, "The Jones Group can groom an heir from a branch family. That's no issue."

He spoke as if steering a corporate titan and selecting its successor were mere trifles.

Hannah shook her head, her gaze piercing. "Will your grandmother agree? Your mother? They won't stand by and watch the Jones bloodline fade. You'll face more than just business pressure."

"That's my burden," Vincent said, brows knitting, his tone resolute. "I'll handle it."

He was trying to shield her, crafting a future free of weight for her. But as his eyes met hers, a sharp realization struck him. He stepped closer, his gaze pinning her. "Is this why you keep pushing me away and dodging me?"

His voice lowered, cutting through her defenses with grim precision. "Because you can't have children, you never planned to start over with me. Telling me to chase you-was that just a ploy to string me along? So you could claim we're not suited and walk away for good when the time's right?"

Hannah's breath faltered. She turned her head, evading his searing gaze, her voice unsteady. "I just think we're not right
searing gaze, her voice unsteady. "I just think we're not right for each other."

Meeting his eyes again, her tone hardened, cold and clinical."Vincent, you can find someone better-someone who can give you children. You'll be happier with her."

"But she wouldn't be you," Vincent rasped, grabbing her wrist,his voice thick with restrained pain.

Hannah winced, tugging against his grip, her voice icy to maintain controL. "I'm talking reality seriously. Stop pulling it back to sentiment."

"I'm serious too." His hold tightened, eyes burning into hers."Hannah, look at me. Tell me about your concerns. Is not having children truly a matter?"

Hannah steeled herself, resolved to crush his hopes with every harsh truth. She met his gaze, her words slow and deliberate."Fine. Let's say we ignore everything, pretend the problems don't exist, and get back together.Then what?"

Her voice carried grim certainty. "You won't withstand your mother and grandmother's relentless pressure-their complaints, their tears. Maybe you'll take it all on yourself,never blaming me. But me? I'll end up believing it's my fault,that I caused this. Every day, I'll think-if we hadn't reunited,you wouldn't be trapped and at odds with your family.All we'd have left is reproach, resentment, and growing distance until we repeat our past mistake and divorce again. Is that what you want?"

Vincent recoiled at the bleak picture she painted, refusing to accept it as their future. Pain and frustration flared in his eyes."Why can't you trust me, just once? Trust I can fix this? I won't let you face it alone!"

Hannah's lips curled into a bitter smile. "Fix it how? By standing between me and your family, tearing your home apart? That's
between me and your famnily, tearing your home apart? That's not fixing-it's brewing a bigger disaster we could never resolve.Tell me,how long would we lastin that mess?"

Vincent fell silent. He opened his mouth, but her brutal logic left his arguments hollow.

Hannah's gaze held his, her heart growing colder,harder,with each moment. She forced his clenched hand open, her voice detached. "So yes, asking you to pursue me was just a spur-of -the-moment excuse to pacify you. Let's end this now."

She turned, avoiding his eyes. "You said it yourself-feelings fade. In time, you'll love someone else, someone truly right for you. I'll have my own life too."

As she stepped away, Vincent's hoarse voice broke through."What about when we made love, Hannah? If you don't love me,why did you let me into your bed?"
###Chapter 501 His Determination

Hannah's smile bordered on cruel, her tone deliberately casual."It was just a few nights in bed. We're adults-satisfying needs,releasing tension. No big deal. Don't make it sound so serious."

With that, she turned, striding briskly toward the elevator without a backward glance. She hailed a cab at the hospital entrance, and during the ride to Sterling Heights, a sudden downpour erupted.

She gazed at the rain pounding the window, her mind wandering.She'd acted rashly regarding Erica. She shouldn't have dragged Vincent into it just to provoke Erica in a fit of impulse. Even alone, collecting evidence bit by bit to send Erica to prison was only a matter of time. Why hadn't she stayed composed? Now, she was tangled in a mess of debts and obligations she couldn't unravel.

And then there was this lingering unrest-and that faint,unwelcome stir in her heart. She despised the feeling.

On the hospital's VIP floor, Vincent stood in the hallway's end,staring at the storm outside. This couldn't go on. He couldn't lose Hannah again. Absolutely not.

A bold idea gripped him suddenly. He spun around, his steps firm as he returned to the examination room. He met the doctor's eyes, unflinching. "Schedule a surgery for me."

...
At Sterling Heights, Hannah took a hot shower, washing away the day's fatigue and chaos, and then slipped into bed early.

The rain outside pounded relentlessly, its steady rhythm a
The rain outside pounded relentlessly, its steady rhythm a soothing hum.

She forced herself to sleep, but her rest was fitful.

After what seemed like forever, urgent knocks jolted her from shallow slumber. Her heart raced as she checked the clock-1:30 a.m.. Who could it be now?

She pulled on her robe and approached the door cautiously,peering through the peephole. Her breath caught, and she flung the door open.

Vincent stood there, drenched to the skin. His face was pale,but his eyes fixed on her with intense focus.

Hannah, stunned, reached instinctively to pull him inside. "In this storm, you..."

Vincent seemed unfazed by the cold, even flashing a faint smile, his voice oddly light. "Traffic was jammed for miles in the rain, and I couldn't wait. So I ran partway here."

Ran? In this torrent? Hannah stared at him, soaked yet eyes gleaming,utterly confused. "What's so urgent?"

A vague unease fluttered in her chest.

Vincent seemed to recall his purpose, fumbling in his suit's inner pocket for a paper, only to pull out a sodden, unreadable sheet.

Hannah eyed the ruined document. "Is that for me?"

"The paper doesn't matter now." Vincent's gaze burned into hers, his tone solemn."What I came to say is-l can't have children either. That was my vasectomy report. I had it done today."

The words hit Hannah like a bolt. Her head snapped up,disbelief flooding her. Her voice rose, trembling with shock and
disbelief flooding her. Her voice rose, trembling with shock and anger. "Vincent Jones! Do you even understand what you've done? Have you gone mad?"

"Never been saner." Vincent's voice remained eerilysteady,his resolve unshaken. "I wanted you to see my commitment,Hannah. I want to be with you-fully, desperately, with everything I have. No barriers, no fears-just us."

He stepped closer, utterly earnest. "This wasn't impulsive. All I know is, if I don't do this, I'll regret it for the rest of my life.I've lived that regret once-l won't again."

Hannah stared at him, every sharp retort dying in her throat. At last,she said, "I don't know what to say."

Was she touched? A bit maybe? No woman could stay indifferent to such unwavering devotion. But to her, it felt less like romance and more like an overwhelming burden. How could he go this far for her?

Sensing the shadow of retreat in her eyes, Vincent spoke quickly, his voice gentle, almost pleading. "Hannah, listen-you don't have to bear any of this. I didn't do it to pressure you,or guilt you, or demand an answer right now."

His gaze held hers, steady and unyielding. "I just wanted to show you my heart, to clear every doubt clouding your mind.Whatever comes-children or not-the one I choose, the only one I want, has always been you. Nothing else."
###Chapter 502 Fever


Vincent halted briefly, retreating a fraction. His voice turned gentler. "Alright, I've spoken all that was on my mind. I'll be going now. Rest properly."

When his words ended, he cast Hannah a lingering stare. The conflicted expression pierced Hannah's chest with pain. Then, he firmly pivoted and walked away.

The door stayed ajar, letting the icy draft rush in,making Hannah tremble. She stayed rooted, her mind in turmoil, like a tempest crashing within. Rest properly? How could she possibly rest properly now?

In the days that followed, it felt like Vincent had entirely disappeared from Hannah's existence. No sudden phone calls, no familiar car idling below at the usual hour.

Initially, Hannah welcomed the calm. She simply required solitude to untangle her conflicted feelings.
Yet, after only a couple of days, unease began gnawing at her.

That night, just as she prepared to bathe, her phone buzzed.It was Derek.

"Ms. Scott, forgive me for disturbing you. Have you happened to see Mr. Jones these past few days?"Derek's tone carried unmistakable worry.

Hannah's pulse stuttered, but she kept her voice calm. "No, I haven't. What's wrong?"

"Apparently, Mr. Jones was drenched in the rain several days ago and has suffered a persistent fever since. It rises and falls, and today he didn't even appear at the office. His phone goes unanswered.I'm really alarmed. I bought medication and went to his residence, but nobody opened the door." Derek's voice grew increasingly tense. "He's unwell. Where could he have gone?"

At once, Hannah remembered that dawn when he stood outside her entrance, soaked to the skin. Her chest constricted, and she exclaimed, "Why is he
wandering around while ill?"

Derek responded, "I honestly don't know! Ms. Scott,if you might..."

"I get it. I'll search for him too!" Hannah cut in,ending the call.

Almost without thinking, she rushed to the doorway and flung it wide. Abruptly, a fever-ridden figure collapsed forward against her. She lunged forward,and his forehead came to rest against her shoulder.His heated breath brushed her skin. Vincent was outside her doorway? When had he arrived?

Her phone chimed again; Derek was calling. She fumbled to answer with one hand."I've found him."

Derek sighed in relief. "That's wonderful! Is Mr.Jones alright? I still have the medicine..."

"Just leave it for now. I'll see that he takes it later,"Hannah said with a sigh.

"Thank you kindly, Ms. Scott!" Derek expressed his gratitude.

Once the call ended, Hannah struggled to drag Vincent inside her place and eased him down onto the couch. He mumbled something incoherent, his brow furrowed in discomfort.

She brought water and fever tablets, carefully propping him up. "Vincent, swallow this medicine."

Though his eyes remained closed, he dutifully consumed the medicine with her help.

Seeing him in this rare moment ofvulnerability,her heart softened briefly, but she still insisted, "Once the fever drops, you're leaving."

With that, she left him behind and stepped away to bathe.

Once she was gone, the man who was supposed to be asleep on the sofa opened his eyes slowly.Despite the redness from his illness, his gaze was clear now.

After her bath, Hannah returned carrying a damp cloth to cool Vincent's fever. She noticed him
appeared to slumber deeply, his breathing steadier.

Leaning over, she intended to feel his forehead for fever. But the moment her hand touched his blazing skin, her wrist was abruptly captured by his fevered grip.

The next moment, her world spun. She let out a startled cry as she was pulled down heavily onto the sofa.

Vincent's feverish frame pressed against her, pinning her beneath.

"You..." Hannah gasped with fury and shock,struggling as she met his gaze. He no longer seemed frail or stricken.

"Your fever's subsided?" she demanded,breathless.

His heated mouth hovered by her ear, his breath searing, making her quiver. "My fever's eased a bit,"he murmured. He clasped her hand and pressed it to his chest. "'But the fire inside won't settle. Hannah, I need to know how you truly feel."
Before she could utter a word, his fevered lips stifled every protest and cry.
###Chapter 503 You Have Feelings For Me
Hannah fought desperately against Vincent, her fists hammering against his shoulder as she struggled to break free. "Let go of me..."

Yet, her resistance only seemed to ignite something deeper within Vincent, making his kisses grów more passionate and demanding.

Slowly, her defiant strength began to fade, her rigid body gradually melting beneath the intensity of his touch.

Sensing her surrender, Vincent drew back slightly,pressing his forehead against hers while breathing heavily. "I knew it...You have feelings for me..."

His fingertips brushed across her slightly swollen lips before trailing downward. "Look at yourself... You've completely given in now."
Hannah jerked back as if burned, shoving him away with sudden force. "Get a hold of yourself!" Her breathing remained ragged, her cheeks still blazing with color, yet she managed to summon a fierce glare. "You're still burning up with fever-stop spouting delirious nonsense!"

Even after being pushed back, Vincent stayed positioned on one knee, effectively blocking her escape route. "My mind is crystal clear. Don't try to deflect," he said roughly. "You absolutely have feelings for me."

Hannah refused to meet his penetrating stare and tried to stand. "We'll discuss this once your fever breaks."

"Let's settle this right now," he insisted, his fingers closing around her wrist. "Haven't I made myself clear? I'd tear down every barrier to be with you. Yet,days have passed in silence from your end. Could you tell me what's really going through your mind?"

Hannah hesitated for a long moment before posing a question, which seemed unrelated. "Does your

grandmother know your decision?"

Vincent frowned, clearly displeased with her bringing this up at such a moment. "This is just between us."

Hannah shook her head, her gaze becoming sharp and focused. "If you're only seeking a casual relationship, then yes, it concerns just us. But Vincent, if you're contemplating something deeper than simple dating-like marriage-then both our families become involved. You cannot keep this hidden from them indefinitely."

Vincent's previously troubled and intense expression melted away at her words. He leaned in abruptly,their noses nearly touching. "So, you're thinking long-term? Have you been considering remarrying me?"

Hannah immediately backtracked, turning away to avoid his searching gaze. "I'm simply being practical about possibilities. Don't read more into it than necessary."

"Since you're awake now, you should go." She

wrenched herself free from his grasp, rose to her feet, and created deliberate space between them,her tone growing cold and detached once more.

Vincent sank back against the sofa cushions, liftig a hand to his forehead. His brow creased with apparent pain as his voice became instantly weak."I'm so dizzy... My entire body feels drained. I can't possibly walk."

He embodied the picture of stubborn defiance.

Hannah observed his theatrical display of weakness,caught between exasperation and amusement,yet finding herself genuinely unable to abandon a sick man. Finally, she released a weary sigh. "Fine, have it your way then."

Turning her back on him, she walked toward her bedroom without another glance.

Just as her hand reached for the door handle,Vincent's muffled voice drifted from behind her."Hannah, trust me... We won't repeat our past mistakes."
Hannah froze momentarily at the threshold, feeling the weight of his intense gaze burning into her spine.
She offered no reply and refused to turn around.

The door closed with a gentle click.

Leaning against the cool wood panel, her thoughts swirled in chaotic spirals.

The following morning, Hannah awakened to find the sofa completely vacant.

Soon afterward, her phone screen illuminated with a message from Vincent. "The evidence points to two plastic surgery clinics-Elegance Surgical Arts and DreamFace Cosmetic Surgery; they maintain the strongest connections to Erica. She's already flown abroad these past couple days, apparently for revision surgery. My people are already on it."

She typed back quickly. "Understood. Thank you."

Meanwhile, the mood at the Jones family estate had turned completely somber.

This morning, upon returning home, Vincent had
delivered shocking news to Sharon and Danica: he could never father children.

"That's absolutely ridiculous!" Sharon's cane crashed against the marble floor, her face draining of color as she fixed Vincent with a withering stare."You've maintained perfect health your entire life.I've reviewed your medical reports annually. How could such a condition suddenly manifest? Which hospital conducted this examination? A bunch of quacks!"

Danica quickly chimed in, "We cannot accept such devastating news without verification! There has to be some mistake. We'll consult the finest fertility specialists and demand comprehensive testing-we must have absolute certainty!"

Vincent's expression remained granite-hard, his tone brooking no argument. "Additional examinations are unnecessary. This is a fact. I've confirmed it thoroughly. Therefore, concerning the company's succession, I'll identify a qualified candidate from our extended family and commence their training
immediately."

"You!" Sharon trembled with rage, yet seeing Vincent's face completely devoid of humor, doubt crept into her certainty. She forced her fury down,attempting rational persuasion. "You don't have to rush into anything just yet! You're still in your prime-with proper treatment, the prospects remain hopeful.The succession matter can certainly be delayed."

Hearing this exchange, Danica, who had initially appeared stunned, felt a flicker of something complicated cross her features. She lowered her gaze,quietly lifting her mug as if carefully calculating her next move. 
###Chapter 504 A Sudden Invitation


At the Luminara Group, Hannah had just wrapped up a meeting when her phone rang. She glanced at the screen and saw Evelyn's name-Claude's mother.

Evelyn's voice carried a warm friendliness. "Ms.Scott, are you free for lunch today? I'd like to invite you to a meal."

Hannah was a little taken aback. They'd only met once before. Why the sudden lunch invitation?

"I'd like to have a casual chat with you." Evelyn paused, her tone softening even more. "But let's keep this between us for now-don't let Claude know."
Hannah tightened her grip on the phone. Instinct told her this lunch was anything but casual. After a brief hesitation, she agreed politely. "Alright, Mrs. Hobbes.
Please send me the location."
At noon, Hannah arrived right on time at the restaurant Evelyn had chosen. By the window, Evelyn was already seated with a young woman Hannah didn't recognize.

The moment Evelyn spotted Hannah, her face lit up with a smile. She waved warmly. "Ms. Scott,come sit here."

Evelyn took Hannáh's hand with practiced affection and gestured to the woman beside her. "Let me introduce you. This is Bonnie Sandoval."

Turning to Bonnie, Evelyn added, "Bonnie, this is Hannah-the Ms. Scott I've often mentioned."

A flicker of surprise crossed Hannah's expression,but she quickly masked it with a courteous smile and nodded politely. "Hello, Miss Sandoval."

Bonnie returned the smile gracefully.

"Not sure what you like, so I ordered a few of the restaurant's signature dishes," Evelyn said as she gently pushed the menu toward Hannah. "See if they

suit your taste?"

Without glancing at the menu, Hannah replied with an easy smile, "It's fine, Mrs. Hobbes. I'm not picky.Whatever you ordered will be wonderful, I'm sure."

Evelyn nodded in approval, her gaze kind yet calculating as she shifted the conversation. "You know, I've always been grateful to the Scott family.If it weren't for your parents taking Claude in and caring for him all these years, I can't imagine how he would have turned out. Your family raised him so well -we've never forgotten that kindness."

Hannah inclined her head modestly. "You're too generous, Mrs. Hobbes. Claude has always been sensible. My parents often said he was easier to raise than I was. He never gave them any headache."

Evelyn smiled, though her eyes continued to scrutinize Hannah's expression. Casually, she steered the conversation toward a sharper point."Oh, look at me, getting carried away in conversation and forgetting to formally tell you. Bonnie is the match my family has chosen for Claude. The two

families are already in talks. Ms. Scott, what do you think of Bonnie?"

The Hobbes family had long since given up on Lindsay, so Bonnie was their new candidate.

Bonnie's smile faltered ever so slightly. She lifted her coffee cup and took a slow sip, hiding her awkwardness.

Hannah found the question awkward-it felt impolite to judge someone sitting right there. So,she chose the safest reply, offering a polite smile. "She's very beautiful and has a lovely demeanor."

Evelyn seemed dissatisfied with this answer, or perhaps intentionally so, as her smile grew more meaningful, her tone gaining a slightly testing edge."What if she becomes Claude's wife? How would you feel about that?"

Bonnie's composure wavered again, her expression tight with embarrassment, but she kept quiet.

Hannah frowned slightly. Evelyn's question felt

unusually blunt and strange. Assuming Evelyn was genuinely seeking her input, she kept her answer diplomatic. "Marriage is a major decision, and Claude's opinion matters most. Since it concerns him, wouldn't it be better if he were here to talk about it himself?"

Her response was purely out of respect for Claude and a matter-of-fact approach.

However, Evelyn interpreted it differently. The warmth drained from her smile, her eyes sharpening with suspicion. To her, Hannah's words sounded like an excuse-evidence that she disapproved of the match and even harbored feelings toward Claude.

Evelyn sat in silence for a few beats before turning to Bonnie with a sudden, almost forced smile. "Bonnie,I just remembered a pastry shop nearby that sells wonderful tarts. I'm craving them-could you pick some up for me?"

Catching the cue, Bonnie rose immediately. "Of course, Mrs. Hobbes. I'll go now."

She gave Hannah a polite nod before walking out.

Once Bonnie was gone, the air at the table shifted.The warmth evaporated, leaving behind a heavy,charged tension.

Evelyn's smile disappeared completely. She dabbed at her lips with a napkin and then lifted her head.Her eyes were cold and sharp as glass. "Ms. Scott, I don't like beating around the bush, so l'll be straightforward."
###Chapter 505 Her Son Seemed Almost Obsessed


Alarm bells rang in Hannah's mind, and she instinctively straightened in her seat.

Evelyn's voice carried a sharp edge of irritation. "1never expected you to harbor such inappropriate thoughts about Claude. I always thought you were a sensible and discreet young woman. It seems I was mistaken."

Hannah could hardly believe her ears.

Evelyn reached into her handbag, pulling out a check she had clearly prepared in advance. She pushed it across the table. "Here's five million. Take it and leave Claude for good. Sever all ties with him from now on."

A sudden heaviness filled the air.

Anger surged through Hannah, though she forced

herself to take a steady breath. She tried to remain calm as she explained, "Mrs. Hobbes, I think there's been a misunderstanding. Between Claude and me..."

She wanted to clarify that nothing improper had ever happened between them, but Evelyn cut her off with a cold sneer. Her eyes brimmed with disdain and impatience. "A misunderstanding? Please. I've already seen enough to know the truth. Why keep pretending? Hannah, as a woman,you should at least be honest and direct. I detest those who act innocent while plotting behind the scenes."

Evelyn's words were pointed, filled with years of pent-up resentment. It was as if she saw in Hannah those women of the same kind who had once entangled themselves with Terrell, causing her immense pain.

If Terrell hadn't fathered an illegitimate child that threatened both her status and her son's inheritance,she would never have sent young Claude away.

Later, when Claude suddenly vanished, she'd traveled back and forth in desperation until she

confirmed that the Scott family had taken him in.Only then had she felt a measure of relief. But she'd left him there while she returned home, locked in a bitter battle with her husband's mistress.

It wasn't until shne'd finally defeated the mistress that she brought Claude home. Thus, she swore never to allow anyone-or anything-to jeopardize Claude's rightful claim to the Hobbes family legacy. To her,this seemingly virtuous Hannah was a dangerous threat, someone who mnight sway her son's heart and make him turn his back on the marriage alliance carefully arranged for him. That was something she was determined to stop with her own hands.

Hannah's expression cooled as she listened to the baseless accusations. Straightening her back, she met Evelyn's gaze head-on. "There is nothing between Claude and me. You've gravely misunderstood, and I see no reason to continue this meal.Goodbye."

She pushed her chair back, ready to stand.

"Nothing between you two?" Evelyn scoffed. She

pulled out a photograph and tossed it onto the table as though it were something filthy. "Then explain this."

Hannah's eyes flicked down instinctively, and in that instant, it felt as though her blood turned to ice. The photo had been taken from an odd angle,like a shot caught by a hidden surveillance camera. In the image, Claude's head was slightly tilted, nestled in the crook of her neck. From the perspective, it looked far too intimate-as if they were caught in a kiss.

Hannah's eyes widened in shock, her mind suddenly blank. When had this happened? No matter how hard she tried, she had no memory of such a moment.She believed she hadn't crossed the line with Claude.

Evelyn noticed the pallor washing over Hannah's face and curled her lips into a satisfied smile. Her tone grew even sharper. "What do you have to say now?Haven't you already shared a bed with him? lf l hadn't uncovered this, just how long did you plan to keep clinging to him?"

The initial shock gave way to a rush of violation and disgust. Lifting her head abruptly, Hannah tore her gaze from the disturbing image and fixed her eyes on Evelyn instead. Her voice trembled with suppressed fury. "Where did you get this photo?"

Evelyn hadn't expected Hannah's first reaction to be questioning the photo's origin rather than defending herself. For a brief second, she faltered before lifting her chin with arrogance. "Does it matter?"

Of course, Evelyn would never admit she had found it in a hidden room inside Claude's residence. After the auction, she had grown suspicious of her son's demeanor toward Hannah and began visiting his residence frequently under various excuses. By sheer chance, she had stumbled upon the hidden room lined with photos of Hannah-candid shots,portraits, distant glimpses, and close-ups. Her son seemed almost obsessed.

Determined to solve this, Evelyn had carefully orchestrated this lunch as both a warning and a test -to drive Hannah away once and for all.
"How can it not matter?" Hannah's voice cut sharply,loud enough to draw curious glances from nearby tables. "As the person involved, I was completely unaware. I don't even remember this happening. Let me make one thing clear: this photograph violates my right to privacy and my right to publicity. I have every right to report it to the police."
###Chapter 506 Discovery Of The Video


Evelyn stood frozen in complete shock. The way events unfolded had completely deviated from her expectations. It should have been her holding damning evidence, prepared to condemn Hannah,who tried to attach herself to her son. Instead, she found herself under interrogation, potentially facing serious legal consequences.

Hannah's composed yet razor-sharp presence in that moment made Evelyn, despite her extensive experience with confrontation, feel genuine unease.

"I discovered it at Claude's residence.How could you possibly be unaware?" Evelyn struggled to project confidence, though her voice betrayed her rising panic.

At Claude's house? Hannah's stomach dropped like a stone. Since reuniting with Claude, she'd visited his residence only once-when he had a flare-up of his
stomach issues. That evening had run late, forcing her to stay overnight where she'd fallen into exhausted sleep. She retained no memory whatsoever of anything resembling the scene captured in that photograph.

As Hannah forced herself to remember, one detail suddenly crystallized. The following morning after that day, while exploring Claude's residence, she'd wandered toward a firmly sealed door. Curiosity had compelled her to reach for the handle, but Claude had abruptly materialized behind her, gently steering her toward breakfast instead. Could that room be where Evelyn claimed to have found the photograph?

The possibility sent ice racing through Hannah's veins.Overwhelmed,she shot to her feet.

"Where exactly do you think you're going without offering any explanation?" Seeing Hannah rise without warning, Evelyn's anxiety transformed into indignation as she attempted to assert authority."Did you absorb a single word I spoke? Your behavior is absolutely disgraceful!"

But Hannah appeared completely deaf to Evelyn's scolding. Without a backward glance, she strode swiftly from the restaurant.

Once behind the wheel, Hannah immediately fired the engine, yanked the steering wheel around, and raced toward Claude's residence at dangerous speed.

She arrived soon enough. The butler recognized her.Though surprised by her unexpected appearance,he maintained perfect respectful composure as he welcomed her inside.

"Ms. Scott, may I offer you some coffee?" the butler suggested, his manner impeccably courteous.

Hannah suppressed the turmoil churning within her chest, maintaining appropriate social grace. "That's very kind. I need to speak with Claude about something urgent. Do you have any idea when he might return?"

"I'll contact Mr. Hobbes immediately to verify," the butler replied without hesitation.

"Alright. Take your time. I'll browse around while waiting for him. It's been ages since I came here,"Hannah said with easy grace, her tone relaxed and natural, as if she were truly just visiting a friend.

Seeing her composed manner, the butler harbored no suspicions. Bowing respectfully, he replied,"Please make yourself at home."

Hannah began wandering, feigning interest in the elaborate paintings adorning the walls.

The moment the butler disappeared into the study to place his call, she abandoned her casual pace.Drawing on fragmented memories, she navigated toward the room that had piqued her curiosity during her previous visit.

The door stood sealed tight, protected by an electronic lock.

Taking a steadying breath, she input Claude's birthday-access denied.

Next, she tried several number combinations he
frequently used-still incorrect.

Her pulse hammered against her ribs as perspiration beaded on her brow. Then, she remembered it:Claude's lucky number, the one he'd shared with her in confidence.

A soft electronic chime echoed through the hallway.

Hannah's heart nearly burst from her chest as she carefully pushed the door open and slipped inside,sealing it behind her.

What she discovered made her world tilt on its axis.This wasn't just any room. Every inch of wall space displayed photographs of her. Different angles,different moments, different Chapters of her life.Pictures of her beaming in graduation robes during college, listening intently at post-wedding celebrations, even a lonely silhouette wandering the streets after her divorce...

Countless images of her, blown up and mounted like trophies, transforming the walls into a shrine.
What made her blood turn to ice was the central monitor dominating the room. It displayed surveillance footage on endless repeat, clearly capturing the guest room where she'd stayed during her last visit.

The footage captured that deep in the night,she lay motionless on the bed, lost in sleep. Then, the door crept open, revealing Claude's silhouette. He stood beside the bed, watching her for what felt like eternity before climbing onto the mattress. Slowly,deliberately, he moved closer, pressing his lips against her neck.

Hannah froze. So Evelyn's damning photograph wasn't fabricated after all. It had genuinely happened. Yet, she'd slept through the entire violation, completely oblivious? How was such deep unconsciousness even possible? Even exhausted beyond measure, wouldn't she sense a man's presence beside her? Unless she'd been deliberately sedated?
###Chapter 507 A Talk In That Hidden Room
Hannah resisted letting her thoughts wander further.Her fingers quivered as she pulled out her phone,snapping shots of the screen and the photographs plastered across the wall.

Right after she captured the last image ánd was about to slip out, the butler's uneasy voice sounded from beyond the door. He seemed to be questioning the maid, "Where's Ms. Scott? How on earth could she vanish without a single trace?"

The timid maid murmured back, "I've checked both upstairs and downstairs. Might she be in that hidden room? That's the only place left unchecked..."

Suddenly, the sound of approaching footsteps rang out.

Hannah refused to conceal herself. Drawing in a
steadying breath, she yanked the door open from inside before the butler could input the password.

The butler jolted at the sight of Hannah standing there, his complexion blanching as cold sweat gathered instantly. "Ms. Scott, what... What are you doing here? This section is restricted; Mr. Hobbes explicitly banned entry!"

His tone shook with fear.

Hannah remained in the doorway, her face bloodless yet her eyes glacial. She shifted slightly aside,motioning toward the photographs covering the room. "Restricted? This place is filled with my photographs. Why shouldn't I step in? Has Claude come back?"

Overwhelmed by the icy sharpness in her eyes, the butler stammered, "M-Mr. Hobbes is already heading here. He'll arrive shortly. Ms. Scott, please... Please leave this room now."

"I'll wait here," Hannah declared, turning and sitting down in the room filled with her photos.
The butler dared not restrain her, hurrying away to call Claude, his voice trembling. "Mr. Hobbes, there's a problem! Ms. Scott went into that room!"

On the opposite end, Claude held silence for several seconds, the air turning rigid. When he finally spoke,his tone carried absolutely no warmth. "Explain."

"I-I looked away only briefly... I'm sorry, Mr.Hobbes..." the butler stuttered, his voice breaking with near tears.

Claude ended the call without another word.

Soon, his vehicle rolled into the courtyard.

Claude stepped out briskly, his expression black as a thunderstorm. "Where is she?" His tone cut like ice.

The butler edged closer nervously. "She's... still inside that room. She said she's waiting there for you..."

Claude didn't spare him a glance, only leaving a curt "Don't follow."
The room's door stood wide open.

Claude advanced toward the threshold and saw Hannah in the center of the room, her chin slightly raised, studying the photographs on the walls with deliberate intensity.

Her profile appeared extraordinarily serene, so serene that it unsettled Claude. He drew a breath,softened his tread, and approached, muttering cautiously, "Hannah."

Hannah didn't turn around; her gaze stayed fixed on the photographs, her voice airy and detached."Claude, have we ever truly been apart? You've preserved photographs of me across time, even moments I myself forgot."

At this point, Claude knew he could no longer hide the truth. He met her eyes, which carried no revulsion or panic as he had expected, only stillness,which unsettled him further.

Abandoning denial, he confessed, his voice low and hoarse, "Yes, we've never been apart."
He stepped forward, his eyes devouring her outline."After my birth parents took me away, I missed you terribly. At first, Ioften sent others to photograph you and deliver them to me. Later, when I grew older, I gained the means to travel back and forth myself.Some images came from my own secret visits."

His gaze softened with faraway tenderness. "I always observed you quietly and carried you in thought.Many times, I witnessed you laughing joyfully with friends, so lighthearted, and I yearned to suddenly appear beside you, to surprise you. But..." He gave a bitter smile. "I restrained myself."

Hannah shook her head, disbelief written on her face. "I don't understand. Claude, you missed me and my parents, and you could have visited us openly.Why resort to secretly watching?"

"The Hobbes family rules are rigid, the household dynamics complicated." Claude's expression dimmed with buried pain. "I didn't want them to find you and deliver a warning, nor did I want them to tear you entirely from me. At that time, I lacked the power to
guard you, and they were capable of anything."

His voice dripped with dread and bitterness toward the Hobbes family.

Hannah's tone turned glacial. "So you chose this way? Secretly taking my images, storing and assembling them one by one, constructing an imagined version of me in this hidden room?Is that it?"

"Yes," Claude admitted, his gaze revealing raw obsession. "Only in this way could I feel you were still with me, that I hadn't wholly lost you."

Abruptly, Hannah remembered that so-called chance meeting at the golf course. She fixed her stare on him. "That golf course encounter was planned by you, wasn't it?"
###Chapter 508 Forget The Brother-Sister Bond
"Yes," Claude admitted without hesitation, his gaze sharp with ambition. "I clawed my way up, step by step, putting every ounce of myself into the fight until that illegitimate child died. I wrestled with family storms to claim my place as heir of the Hobbes family. Only then did I feel I had both the right and the strength to face you. That's why I carefully staged our reunion."

At that instant, all the fragments fell into place,forming a truth Hannah wanted to deny yet could no longer ignore. A chill rippled down her spine, her heart tightening like a knot. "You went to such extremes because you harbor feelings for me?Feelings not of a brother, but of a man toward a woman?"

Claude's eyes locked on hers, carrying the weight of
emotions buried for years. With absolute certainty,he uttered each word like a stone dropping into still water, "Yes. I love you, Anna. It's long escalated from the kind of love a brother has for a sister."

The revelation struck Hannah like a blow. She recoiled, stumbling until her back met the photo wall.Several pictures fluttered down around her like fallen leaves. Her head shook in disbelief, her face a portrait of shock. "This is absurd, Claude. We are siblings. We grew up under the same roof. How could you..."

His gaze darkened, carrying a sorrow long bottled up. He stepped forward, pressing his truth. "We are not bound by blood. We share no lineage. Why should I be forbidden to love you? Hannah,why must my feelings be a crime?"

"But I have always seen you as my brother!" Hannah protested, trapped with no retreat. "That bond was forged long ago. How am I supposed to change my perspective on it now?"

"You can change it now!" Claude's voice rose, his emotions boiling over as he closed in, trying to engulf her in his presence. His eyes burned like firebrands."Forget the brother-sister bond! Look at me. I am a man-a man who loves you, a man who knows you better than anyone else, a man who can give you more support than anyone else!"

His breathing grew heavy, dragged down by memories that weighed like chains. "Do you know what went through me when I heard you were marrying Vincent? I wanted to crash the wedding right then and there. In fact, I did go. I slipped unnoticed among the guests."

He let out a bitter laugh at himself. "I saw you in your wedding dress, smiling at Vincent with a joy that pierced me like a dagger. I watched so long that the moment I thought was perfect to claim you slipped through my fingers. I could only stand there,helpless, as you became another man's bride."

He pressed on, his voice raw. "After you married,I fought to keep you from my thoughts, refusing to ask
about your life. I feared that hearing you were happy would tear me apart, and hearing you weren't would ruin me just the same. Yet, I couldn't stop myself!Anna, I couldn't stop! So I swore I would rise higher than anyone, become the best, and then come before you in honor, to take you back."

"Then you divorced..." His eyes lit up, joy bursting through. "You cannot imagine how that news thrilled me. At last, my chance had come! At the golf course,I rehearsed endlessly before the mirror-how-to greet you,how to smile, how to win your gaze once more...Anna, I like you. I have liked you for more than ten years, down to the marrow of my being."

His confession carried such weight that it pressed the air from Hannah's chest. She felt suffocated,gripped by terror and powerless against it.

Skirting past Claude, Hannah moved toward the screen, steadying her voice though it quivered beneath the surface. "Claude, I won't deny that you've helped me-both in the past and now-and for that, I am grateful. I can also understand the

bitterness of loving without return. But if it were just these photos, perhaps I wouldn't be so shaken. But how do you explain this surveillance footage? You even set it to loop! This is no longer affection-it's obsession. And to be frank, it frightens me."

Claude followed her gaze to the screen, his voice slipping into a murmur, half to her, half to himself."So,you discovered this too..."

Then, he began to move, each step weighted,closing in on Hannah. She found herself backed agáinst the screen, no way out.

Claude braced his arms against the table, caging her within his reach, his presence shutting out all escape.

"What are you planning to do?" Hannah's voice shook despite her effort, her hands curling into tight fists, her body tense like a soldier bracing against an unseen enemy.
###Chapter 509 She Doesn't Agree


Claude lifted his hand-not to harm Hannah-but to reach for the monitor, cutting off the looping playback with a decisive press.

The screen went dark at once, casting back only their hazy reflections, two figures locked in confrontation.

Claude noticed how Hannah's body stiffened, her eyes sharp with fear and guardedness. She was left with only defensiveness. That realization pierced him to the core.

Leaning closer, his breath almost grazing her skin,
Claude asked quietly, "Are you afraid of me?" His fist clenched until the knuckles blanched. "Why would you fear me? Let the whole world tremble if it must-but not you!"

Hannah steadied her breath, forcing her fear down.
She dared not provoke him; she had to keep the

balance on this razor's edge. Summoning calm, she replied, "I'm not afraid of you, Claude. I just need a little time to take it all in..."

Claude gazed intently into her eyes, fearing he might truly scare her. Pushing too hard could backfire.Therefore, he stifled the obsession brewing beneath the surface, softening his tone with a hint of coaxing."Alright, I won't pressure you. Take the time you need. But I want you to see me-not as a brother,but as a man you could truly date and trust. Do you understand?"

"Okay," Hannah answered vaguely, her words chosen only to keep him calm.

Claude seemed somewhat pleased with her response, a meaningful smile curling at his lips. "hope this time, we can turn pretense into reality."

He was referring to their past, when they had acted as lovers to navigate social occasions.

"I'll think about it carefully," Hannah replied, weighing each syllable.

"Don't leave. How about you stay the night here?"Claude's tone thickened with pressure as he stepped closer. "Your room has always been ready, cleaned every day."

"No." Hannah refused instantly, her voice firm. "need to go back. Something awaits me at home."

Claude's brows drew tight, clear discontent flashing through his face. His words turned harder. "What could keep you there? Your mother is abroad. You live alone. What could be so urgent? Just stay here with me."

His persistence pressed like a tightening net, but Hannah dared not yield. Her mind raced, and she shifted the subject firmly. "Claude, let's not dwell on this. I actually came to discuss something else. It almost slipped my mind."

Claude studied her closely, reining in his control streak for the moment. "Go on."

"Let's move," Hannah suggested, walking toward the dining room, trying to sound casual. "I'm feeling a
little thirsty."

They entered the vast dining room.

The servants quietly brought two glasses of water and then melted away without a sound.

Hannah clasped the cool glass, steadying her
thoughts. "Today,your mother invited me for lunch."Claude's eyes chilled instantly. "What did she want?""She gave me a check." Hannah looked up, meeting his gaze. "Five million. The condition-she wants me
gone, cut off from you completely."

A flicker of anger flared across Claude's face. "Ignore her.Pay no heed to a word she said."

"Claude," Hannah said gently, placing the glass down, her words slow to stall for time. "You ask me to see you as my man, but I can't ignore your family.You're the heir of the Hobbes family. Your marriage will always be tied to interests, not entirely your own choice. That's the stark reality between us." Claude's brows knitted tight, clear displeasure brimming at her insistence. "Once I take full control of the family's empire, none of this will bind us.Believe me-three years, and I'll hold it all."

"And after that?" Hannah pressed. "Can we be together without any concerns then? Will your parents, especially your mother, simply step aside?"

"You've thought it through," Claude answered,convinced Hannah was already preparing for the challenges ahead. "Yes, my parents will be our greatest obstacle."

To continue stalling, Hannah intended to ask how he planned to resolve this.

But before she could speak, Claude proposed a bold plan. "So, we can start with a hidden marriage."

His voice carried a feverish excitement. "We'll register quietly, husband and wife in the eyes of the law. When the time is right, when power entirely rests in my hands, we'll tell my parents everything. But this means you might have to endure.Because until then, I might have to keep going on arranged dates openly and perhaps even agree to a formal engagement to keep my family pacified."

Hannah was so shocked by his outrageous plan that her words failed her. She could hardly comprehend Claude's train of thought.

Just then, a cold, cutting voice shattered the heavy air from the dining room entrance. "She doesn't agree."

Hannah turned to see Vincent's tall and commanding figure. Her taut nerves loosened at once. He finally came.
###Chapter 510 Suspicions


Earlier, while trapped in that suffocating room waiting for Claude's return, Hannah had discreetly sent her location and a desperate plea for help to Vincent,her instincts screaming danger. She'd been buying time,praying Vincent would come. And he'd arrived at the perfect moment.

The instant Vincent stepped through the doorway,Claude's expression twisted into something feral."Who authorized your entry? Marco Fuller!"

The butler, Marco Fuller, stumbled forward, his complexion ashen and voice quaking. "Mr. Hobbes,Mr. Jones brought multiple bodyguards and forced his way in. We were powerless to stop him..."

Claude's stare could have frozen hellfire, his words slicing through the air like ice shards. "Mr. Jones,what do you want? Trespassing?"

"Escorting Hannah to safety." Vincent's response was clipped and absolute.

Almost in the same breath, Hannah spoke with crystalline clarity. "I called him here."

Their synchronized declaration left Claude visibly shaken. Disbelief and anguish warred in his eyes as he stared at Hannah. "Why did you do that? You stil can't let him go? Have you forgotten how he had harmed you?"

Hannah held his gaze without wavering, her voice rock-steady. "I simply dislike being in a vulnerable position."

She delivered the truth without embellishment. When fear had cornered her and isolation threatened to suffocate her, she'd needed someone she could trust with her very existence. Vincent had been her first choice.

Drawing a fortifying breath, she wrestled control of the conversation back into her hands. "Claude,there's something I need to confirm with you. You claim to adore me, that you'd sacrifice everything for my sake. Is that genuine? Would you truly do anything l asked?"

Claude's response came without a heartbeat's hesitation, 'his eyes blazing with fervent conviction."Absolutely! For you, I'd mnove mountains! Even if you demanded my life, I'd surrender it gladly!"

"Enough with the pretty speeches!" Hannah cut through his declaration like a blade, her stare boring into his soul. "I want you to answer my question with complete honesty."

Her steely composure compelled Vincent to study Claude with equally grave intensity.

Hannah then voiced the terrifying suspicion that had been clawing at her consciousness, each word deliberate and cutting, "The car accident that killed my dad and harmed my mom... Did you have anything to do with it?"

Those disturbing photographs plastering the walls,the eerie surveillance footage, Claude's ruthless methods in pursuing his obsessions, and his undeniable ties to Erica... All these clues intertwined,making it impossible to dismiss her suspicions about his involvement in her parents' accident. With Vincent standing guard beside her, escape was guaranteed. She finally had the courage to confront the truth.

Claude stumbled backward, his face crumpling under the weight of being suspected by the woman he treasured above all else. Clutching his chest as if physically wounded, he whispered, "I thought you'd recognize my devotion. Even if you couldn't return it,I expected you would be shocked. Never did I imagine you'd respond with terror and mistrust."

His head shook in anguish, tears threatening to spill."Hannah, you're breaking my heart..."

"Answer me!" Hannah stood like granite, her stare unwavering and relentless in its demand for truth.

Claude suppressed the tumultuous emotions within him, meeting her eyes with raw honesty and speaking with absolute conviction. "No! Absolutely not! We shared a childhood; your parents welcomed me into their home and loved me as their own son.They were my family! Even if I were the vilest creature alive, I would never repay such kindness with betrayal and murder! I would never sink that low!"

Sensing his defense needed reinforcement, he pressed on desperately. "And have you forgotten?During that time, I was orchestrating a surprise celebration for their wedding anniversary. The venue,the timeline, the guest list-I'd nearly finalized every detail! How could I be planning their joy moment while orchestrating their death at the same time? It doesn't make any sense."

Suffocating silence descended upon the dining room, broken only by the ragged breathing of its occupants.

After an eternity, Hannah's rigid posture softened fractionally, and the tears she'd fiercely contained finally broke free, tracing silver paths down her cheek. She brushed them away hastily, her voice breaking. "You'd better be telling the truth. Otherwise, my father's soul will never know rest..."
###Chapter 511 The Truth About The Car Crash
A conflicted expression crossed Claude's face.

Spotting the tear trailing down Hannah's cheek,Vincent stepped forward and assertively grasped her hand, pulling her close to his side. His voice carried unwavering authority. "Let's go."

Hannah offered no resistance, nodding with quiet compliance."Okay."

Vincent refused to spare Claude even a glance.
Protectively shielding Hannah, he turned and strode away with purposeful steps.

Claude remained frozen in place, making no move to stop their departure. His gaze followed their retreating forms, fingers intertwined, until they disappeared from sight completely.

Slowly, Claude's eyes drifted shut as he drew in a
 

steadying breath. When they reopened, every trace of emotion had been swept away, replaced by an impenetrable coldness. Raising one hand, he gestured to Marco who had been maintaining a respectful distance.

Marco hurried over with a practiced bow. "Mr.Hobbes."

Claude's tone remained perfectly controlled, yet something in it made the air turn frigid. "Was that video cleaned up?"

Marco paused, momentarily confused. "Are you referring to the footage where we uncovered Miss Stanton's involvement?"

Not a flicker of emotion colored Claude's response."Yes."

That video remained burned into his memory with painful clarity. Originally, fearing Erica might harm Hannah, he'd arranged for discrete surveillance of her activities. What they discovered instead was Erica orchestrating a plot to cause a fatal car crash

 
targeting Hannah's parents.

Upon viewing the evidence, his immediate instinct had been fury and an overwhelming urge to intervene. The Scott family had raised him as their own son. Standing idle was unthinkable. Yet, just as he prepared to act, a poisonous thought crept into his consciousness.

During that period, Hannah and Vincent had been spending increasing amounts of time together, their paths crossing repeatedly.

Powerless to intervene, Claude had found himself drowning in jealousy. Night after night,he watched the woman he loved grow closer to her former husband. The agony of frustration and burning jealousy consumed him relentlessly. A dark, twisted notion began taking root. What if tragedy actually befell Hannah's parents?

Drowning in profound grief, Hannah would become vulnerable and lost, with only one person she could trust completely-him, the "brother" who'd shared her childhood. How could Vincent, a mere outsider,

 
truly comprehend the depths of her anguish? In her darkest hour, she would naturally pull away from Vincent and seek comfort in his arms instead.

Once this corrupted thought took hold, it had infected Claude's reasoning like a spreading poison.Ultimately, he'd chosen the path of silence. The vital video evidence that could have exposed Erica was deliberately destroyed, leaving him a passive observer.

Claude had told himself this was merely a temporary measure to draw Hannah back to his side.He would never truly allow harm to befall her parents-he would maintain control over the situation.

But fate had other plans entirely. Never could he have foreseen the car crash spiraling so catastrophically beyond his control. Raymond had died instantly, while Margaret lay gravely injured and unconscious.

This outcome had far exceeded his expectations.Shock and remorse crashed over him. Yet, buried deep within his heart,  a twisted satisfaction confirmed his darkest beliefs. Drowning in overwhelming grief, Hannah had indeed clung to him like a lifeline, severing all ties with Vincent completely.

Now, Hannah's growing suspicion cut through him like a blade. Though she hadn't uncovered the full truth, it filled him with an unprecedented sense of crisis. All obstacles needed to be eliminated more swiftly.

Drawing in a measured breath, Claude túrned to Marco, his voice resuming its characteristic composure while carrying unmistakable authority."Arrange surveillance on Hannah. Every movement she makes, I want documented."

A chill ran down Marco's spine as he nodded. "Yes,Mr.Hobbes."

Claude's attention shifted toward the window, his expression sharpening with calculated ambition."Also, inform my mother that l've accepted the proposal of the strategic marriage alliance. Tell her to expedite the arrangements immediately."

 
Surprise flickered briefly across Marco's features before he lowered his gaze once more."Understood."

A cruel smile played at the corners of Claude's mouth. A strategic marriage alliance? Nothing mnore than a convenient stepping stone to seize absolute control. His intention was to claim complete dominion over the Hobbes family empire as rapidly as possible. Once he wielded unshakeable power,who would possess the audacity to question his choices? He could marry anyone he desired!Hannah... After years of patient waiting and observation, she could only belong to him.

Meanwhile, Vincent's black sedan maintained steady progress along the return route. Hannah's vehicle had been retrieved by one of Vincent's security personnel.

Vincent cast a sideways glance at Hannah, breaking the car's heavy silence. "You look exhausted. Close your eyes and rest for a while, okay?"

Hannah shook her head gently, her voice carrying a
 

distant quality, "I'm not tired. How's the situation with Erica?"

"My team is already retrieving her complete cosmetic surgery records and documentation," Vincent responded evenly. "Once they return from overseas,we'll have concrete evidence."

"Hmm." Hannah's soft acknowledgment hung in the air for several moments before she spoke again,quietly. "Thank you for today."

"There's no need for gratitude," Vincent replied,detecting the heaviness weighing on her words."How about I take you somewhere?"
###Chapter 512 Memories Stirred


Hannah instinctively denied it. "I'm not upset."

Vincent chose not to expose her lie. Instead, he spoke with quiet gentleness. "Close your eyes and take a little nap. I'll wake you when we get there."

Hannah asked no more. She leaned her head lightly against the seat back, her eyes drifting to the scenery outside the window, and little by little, the tension in her chest eased.

In time,Vincent's car rolled to a stop on a deserted stretch of coastline.

The sun was sinking, half-buried in the sea, casting the sky in fading gold.

When Hannah opened the car door, she was momentarily dazed, overwhelmed by the vast horizon before her. She turned to Vincent, her voice soft."Why did you bring me here?"


 
Vincent did not look at her right away. His eyes were fixed on the restless sea. "When you're unhappy,isn't this the place you always run to-the seaside,where the breeze carries your worries away?"

He paused, as if lost in old memories. "Back then,you told me that whenever life tangled your thoughts,you'd come here, watch the waves, and somehow things felt lighter."

He was speaking of days long past. Those were the times when she had pursued him with awkward persistence and burning fervor.

Back then, Vincent had found her presence troublesome-too constant, too clinging, too much like a shadow he couldn't shake. But one day, the girl who was always in his sight suddenly vanished. She didn't appear for several days.

Vincent had surprisingly felt unsettled, an emptiness he couldn't explain gnawing at his routine. For the first time, he'd swallowed his pride and asked her roommates about her whereabouts.


 
But unexpectedly, what he'd received instead was a handful of sharp remarks. They offered no clue about Hannah's whereabouts, only vicious descriptions that painted her as "spoiled," "unsociable," and "desperate."

At that moment, something inside Vincent had snapped cold. Frustration surged, sharp and unnamed.

It was then he'd first resorted to tracing her phone's location. The signal led him to a secluded beach outside the city.
He'd driven there in haste,his heart pounding faster than the tires on the road. And when he finally found her-barefoot, dashing across the sand, calling out to the waves with laughter-she looked utterly carefree.

He had been displeased then, even annoyed,thinking himself a fool for worrying so much. Yet, as he approached, stern-faced, and she noticed him,the sudden radiance in her smile was like sunlight breaking through clouds, striking directly into his chest.
She'd run toward him like a bird freed from its cage,flinging herself into his arms without hesitation.

And in that instant, Vincent had felt his heart collide with something fierce, beating out of control. A wave of panic and vulnerability consumed him-an odd paradox of feeling both elated and flustered.

Almost instinctively, he'd shoved her away, rough and abrupt. The instant he did, regret pierced him because her bright eyes dimmed at once, tears flooding in as though a dam had burst, brimming with grievance.

Vincent had stood frozen, unsure what to do with his hands. He had never seen Hannah cry so bitterly-and all because of him.

On impulse, he'd reached out, clumsy in his attempt to wipe her tears. But she only cried harder, pressing into his chest, soaking his shirt with grief.

Later, he had finally learned why she had disappeared. Her roommates' exclusion, along with his own constant rejection, had left her wounded, so she had slipped away to the seaside to mend her heart.

She'd said that coming here lifted her spirits somewhat, and seeing him made her happier still.But she hadn't expected him to push her away-and so,she broke down.

If Vincent hadn't spoken of it now, Hannah would have nearly forgotten that episode. Those memories,once sweet yet laced with sorrow, had long been buried beneath the struggles of their marriage.

Hannah was momentarily taken aback, and then a faint, nostalgic smile curved her lips. "I didn't expect you to remember all this."

Vincent turned toward her, his gaze deep, the sea breeze ruffling his hair. "I remember everything you say."

Hannah said nothing more. She drifted toward the shoreline, sat down, wrapped her arms around her knees, and fixed her eyes on the far horizon where sea and sky became one.

 
As the waves whispered, her thoughts wandered to another memory that stung. Her voice was soft,almost as if speaking to herself, yet it was also meant for Vincent. "I remember that, after we got married,we had a fight. I was so furious thatI left home and came here, to the sea."

A faint, bitter laugh slipped from her. "But that time,you didn't come. I sat here for hours, from dawn to dusk, feeling as though the sky was collapsing, as if the world itself had abandoned me. Looking back now, I almost laugh at how dramatic | was-crying over a man..."

Vincent, seated beside her, frowned at her words.His voice, low and steady, cut through with certainty."You're mistaken."

Hannah lifted her head, startled.
Vincent's gaze was unwavering, calm yet firm. "I did come to find you. In fact, I was the first to find you."
###Chapter 513 His Perspectives Of The Story
The sea breeze swept past with a bitter chill, sending loose strands of hair dancing around Hannah's face.

Vincent's revelation had unleashed chaos within Hannah's chest. Confusion clouded her expression."That can't be possible. My memory is crystal clear.Rena was the one who found me first."

According to her recollection, she and Vincent had engaged in a vicious argument. Acting on pure impulse, she'd hastily packed her belongings and stormed away from their home, swearing never to return.

Afterward, she'd found herself alone at the coastline,purchasing numerous bottles of beer before settling on the sand to drink herself into oblivion. Upon awakening, she'd discovered herself tucked into a hotel bed with Rena seated beside her, providing

 
gentle care.

Vincent's brow furrowed deeply, his voice carrying absolute conviction. "That's completely wrong.Following our argument, the household staff came running to inform me of your disappearance. Your phone remained unreachable, sending everyone into a panic. Without hesitation, I cancelled every important meeting on my schedule and rushed out to search for you."

The memory of that frantic anxiety flickered through his eyes. "I scoured every location you frequented-shopping centers, coffee shops, even your closest friend's apartment-but found nothing. Eventually,the seaside occurred to me."

Vincent's gaze held hers steadily. "I recalled you mentioning once that whenever sadness overwhelmed you, the ocean called to you. So,l drove there straight away. When I finally located you,several empty beer bottles surrounded your spot on the sand, and alcohol had clearly taken its toll. Rather than showing relief at seeing me, you erupted in fury,

 
shouting that I was a 'heartless bastard' and an 'unfeeling monster,' accusing me of 'complete indifference' toward you."

Pausing, he added, "Recognizing your intoxicated state, I avoided escalating the confrontation and attempted to escort you to a nearby hotel for proper rest. Yet, you fought against me with desperate determination, ultimately shoving me from the room and securing the door against my entry."

Vincent released a weary sigh, the frustration of that moment still vivid. "Left with no alternatives, I contacted Rena to provide the care you needed,since your drunken hostility made my presence impossible. Has all of this truly vanished from your memory?"

Hannah stared in stunned disbelief, her mind frantically searching through her recollections yet finding absolutely nothing. Those heated confrontations, his desperate search, his genuine concern for her safety... All those memories had been drowned beneath waves of alcohol, leaving

 
behind only the comfort of Rena's presence and the crushing loneliness that greeted her awakening.

Hannah's voice carried uncertainty and doubts."Then why wasn't I able to see you the following morning?"

"Just before sunrise, an emergency call came through. A critical overseas business arrangement was collapsing, requiring my immediate flight to salvage the situation." Vincent's explanation held a somber weight. "Since you appeared to bé resting peacefully under Rena's watchful care, I departed.My intention was to have a proper conversation once you'd recovered. However, when I returned several days later, you never brought up the incident again."

Hannah's smile turned bitter. "Of course... That makes perfect sense."

From her viewpoint, it represented yet another Chapter of disappointment and abandonment.Vincent's absence always seemed to coincide with her moments of greatest need. This pattern of neglect had woven itself throughout the fabric of

 
 their entire marriage.

"I was..." Vincent began, intending to elaborate on that deal's crucial importance to the company and the impossibility of being present in multiple locations simultaneously. Yet, his explanation shifted into something far more vulnerable. "Work was consuming everything at the time. But my feelings for you, Hannah, run deeper than you could possibly fathom.That incident won't happen again."

Both promise and personal vow colored his declaration.

Hannah redirected her attention toward the endless expanse of ocean. Wind played through her flowing hair as silence stretched between them. Eventually,she released a quiet laugh. "Our interpretations exist in completely different universes."

Her tone grew gentle. "From my perspective, this marriage was something I essentially forced upon you from the very beginning. You consented to wed me because circumstances left you without alternatives, didn't you? Throughout our entire

 
wedding ceremony,tension never left your features-not even a trace of joy appeared. I've always believed you resented having to marry me. Our union felt like something you grudgingly granted as a favor."

Vincent felt the breath leave his lungs at Hannah's revelation. His gaze fixed on her profile while a tempest of emotions raged within him.

Several heartbeats passed before Vincent collected himself enough to respond. "Unhappiness had nothing to do with it. What you witnessed was pure nervousness."

"Nervous?" Hannah swiveled toward Vincent with genuine surprise, as though encountering an entirely foreign concept. The notion seemed impossible-Vincent experiencing nervousness?
###Chapter 514 It Was | Who Needed You
"Yes, I was nervous," Vincent confessed with rare embarrassment, his voice muffled as he turned his face aside."That was your first wedding. Were you not nervous yourself?"

"Of course, I was nervous," Hannah admitted at once, her mind drifting back to that day. "But I was more thrilled than flustered, because I was marrying the man I had loved for so long.And you? You looked as though you had been dragged to some dreadful duty. You didn't smile once. Your brow was furrowed from start to finish."

The memory was crystal clear in her mind. Their friends had teased that Vincent resembled a man marching toward a funeral rather than a wedding.

Vincent pressed his lips together with frustration and remarked in a low tone, "Alright, it seems there were

 
many misunderstandings between us."

"Indeed," Hannah answered softly, her sigh carried away by the sea breeze, tinged with wistful melancholy.

"It's alright," Vincent said with quiet earnestness,gazing into the vast horizon of the sea. "From this moment on, I'll speak my heart plainly. I'll tell you what I think and what I feel. No more silent guessing,no more misinterpretation."

The wind moved gently, and Hannah listened in silence.

They sat side by side on the sand, cherishing a rare pocket of peace.

Hannah rested her head lightly upon her knees and murmured, "Whenever I see the ocean, it feels like a breath of fresh air. The waves sweep away my restless thoughts, leaving my heart as calm as still water."

Vincent studied the serenity of her profile,recalling

 
the disarray of that drunken night. He turned toward her and asked quietly, "If the sea brings you calm,then why did you drink so heavily after running here due to our quarrel? Shouldn't the ocean alone be enough to lift your spirits?"

At his words, Hannah's arms instinctively tightened around her knees. She fell silent, her gaze distant, as though searching for forgotten feelings buried in time.

The wind tangled her hair, and her voice,thoúgh soft,struck Vincent's heart with piercing force. "Because watching the sea didn't help then. I couldn't find calm. I sat there, staring at the waves crashing endlessly, and one thought circled in my mind-should I give up on you? Only half a year into our marriage, and it felt as though all my expectations and hopes had crumbled. Everything was unlike what I had imagined. I wasn't happy at all."

She exhaled lightly, as if releasing a weight she had carried too long.

Vincent, however, felt frozen by her words. Just six months into marriage, she had already considered leaving him? She sat by the very sea he thought would heal her, and instead, she pondered ending everything.

A delayed shock gripped his chest, sharp pain spreading like a blade. His Adam's apple moved violently as he tried to speak, yet words lodged in his throat, leaving only a cold dread running down his spine.

At last, his voice emerged hoarse. "Back then, you already considered divorcing me?"

It hadn't been a rash outburst from their first quarrel.For Hannah, it had been a carefully weighed escape.

"Yes," Hannah admitted frankly, with no attempt to dodge. "More than once, I resolved to end it, feeling l couldn't hold on. But every time you apologized-even if it was just a half-hearted 'sorry' or a softened tone-I would foolishly hesitate again."

She turned her gaze toward Vincent and continued,"And then there were my parents. I had insisted on
 
 marrying you and refused to yield even when things faltered. I couIdn't bear the thought of them seeing me divorced so soon after marriage. I didn't want them to think they had misjudged you, and I certainly didn't want to prove their concerns right. So l convinced myself, again and again, to endure a little longer."

Every word was like a needle, pricking Vincent's heart one after another. His throat tightened, a sour ache rising to the corners of his eyes. After a long silence, he managed to press out a heavy whisper. "I have failed you too deeply."

"Yes," Hannah replied, half in jest yet wholly honest."I foolishly endured you for far too long. Looking back, I should have been decisive, divorced you then and there. I wouldn't have wasted so many of my best years. I could have traveled, explored, and perhaps even lived more as myself."

Vincent's heart contracted tightly. "Yes, you're right,"he said, swallowing hard, his voice stripped of all pretense. "You're the most vibrant soul l've ever known, like a resilient plant thriving wherever it takes root."

And for the first time, Vincent had confessed, "All along, it wasn't you who needed me-it was I who needed you."

Hannah turned to him, her eyes wide with surprise.
###Chapter 515 Fireworks For Her


Vincent fixed his eyes on Hannah and said, "It was an entire year after you departed from Dorbarrow that l finally came to fully understand that it had always been I needed you, not the other way around. The sensation became undeniable."

Hannah's gaze drifted away, seemingly wandering through recollections of that year of freedom. "That year, I truly lived a fulfilling life. I journeyed to countless destinations alone and accomplished countless things. Although exhausting, my spirit felt unbound and joyful."

Vincent's mouth curved into a sorrowful grin. "By contrast, that year was the bleakest for me. Each day seemed like I was simply going through routines.The company kept functioning, contracts were signed,profit accumulated... yet inwardly, I felt utterly vacant.Returning from work to a vacant home, the emptiness added to the void inside me." A heavy stillness lingered between them. There came only the sound of waves breaking against the coastline.

"This is the first time I've ever heard you reveal such feelings." Hannah finally broke the silence with a shade of emotion.

"Yeah," Vincent answered, sharing the same weight of emotion and introspection. "We truly lost so much."

Their failed marriage lacked comprehension and effective communication, and worse, was devoid of the proper response and presence when the other needed it the most.

The ocean wind carried a sting as the evening thickened.

Hannah rose, dusting the grains from her trousers."I feel a lot lighter now. Darkness is falling; let's return."

Vincent rose likewise. "What do you plan to do about Claude?"
"Let it settle," Hannah responded evenly. "To me,he's like an elder brother who matured alongside me.Nothing more. Yet, the things he did, especially that video, crossed the line."

"Video? What video?" Vincent swiftly caught the crucial term in her statement, his chest tightening faintly, brows knitting. What even worse things had Claude done?

Plainly reluctant to elaborate, Hannah vaguely said,"Nothing much, just a video he creepily filmed without my consent."

She refused to dwell on the surveillance footage from the dim chamber at that instant, since it sickened her.

As she turned to depart, her wrist was softly held by him.

"Hold on." Vincent's tone carried from behind her.

Hannah paused and faced him. "What is it?"

"I've got something for you." Vincent's tone bore a

 

trace of nervousness and anticipation.

"What is it?" Hannah inquired, mildly astonished.

Vincent advanced a step, the ocean wind ruffling the strands upon his brow. He gazed at her, his look steady and intent. "Shut your eyes."

Instinctively, Hannah closed her eyes.

Abruptly, there came a crisp snap of fingers and then several shrill bursts tearing through the nocturnal air.

Her eyes shot open instantly. Radiant fireworks blossomed across the meeting line of sea and sky ahead of her. One after another flared, illuminating the profound night.

Her lips parted slightly; she even forgot to inhale for an instant. "When did you prepare this?" she whispered, her voice tinged with the tremor of surprise.

Vincent stood beside her, his gaze never leaving her profile. "On the way here."


 
He paused and softly asked, "Does this delight you?"Hannah gazed at the fireworks and nodded eagerly."Extremely delighted... I always carried a particular affection for fireworks."

Vincent knew it. Back when they still dated, she had once dragged him through throngs to watch fireworks, laughing more brightly than the fireworks themselves. Yet, after marriage, he'd sunk into endless duties and disregarded her likes, occupied enough to repeatedly forfeit the chance to see fireworks with her.

The magnificent fireworks display before them had been secretly arranged by him a month earlier. Each shape displayed her initials in singular calligraphy, all carefully chosen by him. Initially, it was meant as part of a declaration of his feelings toward her. But at this instant, he just hoped she was happy.

Hannah lifted her eyes to the heavens, while Vincent quietly studied her. Her gaze glittered brighter than the fireworks.


 
:
It was uncertain how long it lasted before the fireworks concluded. The brilliance yielded to stillness.

Hannah exhaled lightly, her words tinged with soft sorrow, "Each time after watching fireworks, a slight grief remains. Regardless of how stunning anything may be, it is merely a passing instant, unable to be seized or held."

"But what matters is the journey, not the finish. Isn't that true?" Vincent's tone rose beside her, firm and unwavering. "At the very least, the fireworks we observed together were stunning."

Hannah shifted toward him, teasing, "This hardly resembles something you'd say."

"And what do you think I would utter?" Vincent arched his brow.

"For example, you'd remark, what's so impressive about fireworks?" Hannah's eyes gleamed with mischief.

 

Vincent appeared faintly doubtful. "Would I really be such a downer?"

"You once were." Hannah's grin broadened.

The two carried on with playful teasing, as though some unspoken change had occurred between them.
###Chapter 516 Records Changed


Several days passed before Erica's flight touched down. The moment she cleared customs, the comprehensive documentation Vincent had arranged to collect was already in his possession.

Vincent wasted no time scheduling a private meeting with Hannah at an inconspicuous café. Placing a substantial envelope on the table between them, he slid it toward Hannah with unmistakable gravity etched across his features. "I've already reviewed everything inside. Brace yourself before you check it out."

Hannah caught the unusual seriousness in his demeanor, immediately sensing something was terribly wrong. Carefully opening the envelope, she extracted the enclosed documents.

Initially, she encountered a series of before-and-after surgical photographs. Her eyes widened in stunned

 
recognition as she studied the familiar features captured in the images. This wasn't Erica at all. The person documented in these photos was unmistakably Brinley.

A slight tremor ran through Hannah's hands. Yet, she steadied herself, forcing analytical clarity to override her shock. "So Erica's sudden overseas departure wasn't merely for revision surgeries. Her true objective was to seize the opportunity to substitute authentic records linked to 'Erica' at the surgical facility. She's completely assumed Brinley's identity.What an ingenious strategy."

She couldn't deny the sophisticated cunning behind Erica's maneuver.

"Indeed." Vincent's response carried an icy edge."She's committed substantial resources to this endeavor, requiring considerable financial investment."

His fingers drummed against the table surface as his expression darkened. "What intrigues me more is the source of such enormous funding. This amount

 

exceeds anything she could have accessed independently. Something far more complex lies beneath the surface, and we need to uncover the truth."

Hannah put the documents down on the table and massaged her temples thoughtfully. "Perhaps we should abandon our focus on determining 'her actual identity.' Since she's done such a thorough job, she's probably already erased most traceable evidence.We need to pursue a different approach."

"Agreed." Vincent nodded decisively. "I'll deploy my team to investigate her financial networks and every social connection she maintains. We'll find a way."

Without delay, he dispatched instructions to mobilize every available resource for a comprehensive investigation into all domestic and international assets, plus account transactions linked to Erica's name or potentially connected aliases.

After wrapping up their discussion, Hannah paused uncertainly before speaking. "Vincent, there's something I need to ask..,"

 
"Go ahead." Vincent immediately turned his attention to her.

"Would it be possible to lend me one of your bodyguards? Just one would suffice." Pauusing,she added, "While I could arrange private security myself, I don't really trust the people from those security companies. Their backgrounds remain unclear. Your bodyguards are both professional and dependable."

Vincent's agreement came instantly. "Absolutely.Take however many you require. I'll make the arrangements immediately."

However, something in her request triggered his concern, causing his brow to furrow. "What's prompted this sudden need for protection? Has something happened?"

Tension crept into his voice immediately.

Not wanting him to overreact, Hannah kept her voice calm. "It's nothing major. Lately, I just have this feeling that someone may be tracking my

 
movements. Perhaps it's merely paranoia, though it could be illegitimate surveillance. Regardless, the uncertainty makes me uncomfortable."

Vincent's expression grew thunderous. "Is Claude responsible?"

"I'm not sure." Hannah shook her head. "There's no concrete evidence, just a feeling."

"I'm going to confront him!" Vincent began rising from his seat, fury blazing in his eyes.

"Stop!" Hannah's hand shot out to grasp his wrist."Don't act rashly. Right now, my priority is simply ensuring my personal security remains intact.Besides, if someone is genuinely following me, I want to discover their ultimate intentions."

Throughout it all, she maintained her composure.

Vincent grasped her hand in return. "I'm assigning my elite protection team to you!"

"There's no reason to create such a spectacle."Hannah's smile held resigned amusement, "One bodyguard suffices. One bodyguard draws less attention and won't tip off potential observers."

"Two at minimum!" Vincent's tone brooked no argument. "One operating openly, another working covertly,providing mutual backup."

"Just one will do." Hannah shook her head.

Vincent didn't budge. "Trust my judgment. Two."

Recognizing the genuine concern and stubborn determination reflected in his gaze, Hannah eventually exhaled in surrender. "Fine, go with your decision.Just ensure they remain inconspicuous."

Only then did Vincent's tension ease slightly, though his voice carried a stern caution. "The moment anything feels amiss, press the emergency button on your wristband immediately, and I'll reach you in no time."

"Understood. I will." Hannah acknowledged with a nod.

Throughout the following days, two discrete

 
bodyguards seamlessly wove themselves into Hannah's daily routine, maintaining precisely the right distance to guarantee her protection.

Normalcy appeared to return, and that unsettling sensation of being monitored vanished entirely.Everything felt blissfully peaceful.

Yet, that particular afternoon, Hannah's phone erupted suddenly, the name illuminating her screen causing her pulse to stutter. Claude was calling. She wrestled with uncertainty for several moments before answering, her response deliberately distant and frigid."Hello?"

Claude's voice flowed through the line with its characteristic warmth. "Are you available for dinner this evening? There's a matter I need to discuss with you face to face."
###Chapter 517 About Becoming Mine


Hannah's instinct was immediate refusal. "I believe we've already said everything that needed to be said last time. Another meeting serves no purpose."

Claude's soft laughter carried an undercurrent of coercion. "It's just a meal. What's the harm in agreeing to it?"

"Phone conversations work perfectly fine for whatever you need to discuss," Hannah responded,her voice maintaining icy firmness.

Claude fell silent for several heartbeats. When he spoke again, his tone preserved its gentle quality, yet his words sent ice coursing through Hannah's veins,"Hannah, surely you wouldn't want me to bother your mother during her overseas recovery, would you? Her health remains fragile. I bet she'd certainly wish to know about your current circumstances, wouldn't she?"


 
The threat hung unmistakably in the air.

Hannah's breathing faltered momentarily. Claude understood exactly how deeply she cherished her mother and her desperate desire to spare her mother any additional worry. Should he actually approach her mother with malicious lies... Her grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles whitened.

From the other end, Claude waited with patient confidence, clearly certain of her eventually givingin.

Following an agonizing stretch of silence, Hannah practically forced the word through clenched teeth."Fine."

Claude's voice immediately sparkled with triumphant satisfaction. "Excellent, I'll text you the location momentarily.See you tonight."

Seven o'clock sharp found Hannah arriving first at Cloudtop Restaurant. She strategically chose an interior table offering clear sightlines, while her two bodyguards positioned themselves at appropriate distances, maintaining casual appearances while remaining within protective range without drawing undue attention.

Claude appeared shortly after her arrival. Settling into the seat opposite hers, a subtle smile curved his lips. "I half expected Vincent to accompany you tonight."

Hannah lifted her water glass for a measured sip,her response perfectly controlled. "I don't require his constant companionship."

She appeared composed.

"Is that so?" Claude smiled meaningfully, not pressing the point. Surveillance photos from his operatives clearly documented Vincent's frequent presence in her life.

Casually retrieving the menu, he extended it toward her while speaking as though no bitter history existed between them. "See if there's anything you want? Or shall I order your usual preferences?"

Hannah refused even a cursory glance at the offered

 

menu, sliding it away dismissively. "I have no appetite. Just tell me what you need to say in person." She possessed zero interest in engaging with meaningless pleasantries and desired only to conclude this encounter swiftly.

Claude didn't push the matter, setting the menu aside and settling back slightly while studying her intently. "You remain completely unchanged, still so perpetually impatient."

"This has always been my nature." Hannah held his stare without flinching. "You claim to know me thoroughly, don't you? So why does this seem to catch you off guard?"

Claude released a chuckle, his attention growing laser-focused and penetrating. "Indeed, I understand you better than anyone."

Leaning forward to close the space separating them,his voice dropped to serious, intimate tones. "I've provided you with ample time for careful consideration. So,have you reached a decision?"
Hannah's heart plummeted as dread washed over her. She recognized exactly what he referred to, yet deliberately chose to play ignorant. "A decision about what? I don't understand what you're talking about."

"About becoming mine," Claude stated with crystal clarity, his gaze imprisoning hers and eliminating any possibility of evasion. "Give me an answer, Hannah."

Hannah attempted to appeal to his rationality."Claude, think about it rationally. What exactly do you like about me? We've shared our entire childhood, creating bonds that run incredibly deep.Isn't it possible that what you interpret as romantic love is actually protective, brotherly devotion that you've misidentified?"

Claude regarded her with unwavering intensity. "How could | possibly confuse familial affection with romantic love? Initially, yes, I viewed you as my sister,but somewhere along the way, those feelings transformed entirely. I love you, Hannah, with the desire a man feels for a woman. I want to embrace you, kiss you, claim you completely as mine, and

 
share my life with you."

His raw confession drained all color from Hannah's face instantly, nausea rising in her throat. She shot to her feet abruptly, her voice cutting like winter air."Absolutely impossible. I won't be your woman."

Her decisive rejection and desperate attempt to establish boundaries pierced Claude like a blade. The tenderness in his expression vanished immediately,replaced by consuming darkness as long-suppressed jealousy and rage erupted to the surface. "Impossible? Yet with Vincent, it's possible,right? Have you already slept together? Despite your divorce and the claim that you've moved past him,you still find yourself beneath him in a bed, don't you? Tell me exactly how many times you've slept together?"
###Chapter 518 Engagement Celebration Invitation


Claude's words spilled out unchecked-sharp as knives, cutting the air and drawing curious glances from nearby tables.

Hannah trembled with fury, her fingertips numbed as though her anger itself had frozen her blóod. She stared at the man before her, menace etched in his features, and felt as if she were facing both a stranger and a nightmare. "Claude,you really are...It's as if I don't know you anymore."

With that, she turned to leave, decisive and firm,every second of lingering suffocating her.

"Wait!" Claude's voice cracked with urgency, his earlier outburst shoved beneath a veneer of control.

He strode forward-not to block her path, but to draw an ornate invitation card from his suit pocket,


 

 extending it to her. "Look at this. After seeing it, are you still going to leave?"

Hannah froze mid-step, hesitantly took the card, and unfolded it. Inside were the names of Claude and Bonnie, with an engagement ceremony marked for the coming week.

She closed it, her brows knitting together as she studied him, her gaze riddled with scrutiny and doubt. "You're getting engaged?"

The revelation struck like thunder-too sudden, too jarring, especially after his fiery confession of feelings for her only moments earlier.

"Yes." Claude's eyes darkened with complexity."The date is set for next week."

He paused, his voice dropping to a murmur as he tried to rationalize his earlier outburst. "Now you see why I was so agitated? My plan was simple-if you had agreed to be with me tonight, I'd have torn that invitation to shreds and ended the engagement at once."


 
A bitter laugh escaped him, steeped in disappointment and unwilling surrender. "But you...You were resolute. So resolute that you left me no room for fantasy and slim hope. So resolute that all I can do now-paradoxically-is give up."

He pressed hard on the words "give up," watching her face for any flicker of emotion.

Hannah stayed silent, weighing the news and his words like a stone pressing against her chest. At last,she calmly returned the invitation to him, her voice polite yet distant. "Congratulations."

Claude didn't take it. Instead, his gaze pierced hers,searching, pressing. "Will you come to my engagement ceremony?"

Hannah looked away, her response deliberately vague. "Depends on my schedule. We'll see."

"I'll be waiting for you to come." His tone hardened,stubborn as iron, edged with an unspoken threat."If you don't come, the ceremony won't begin."

 
:
Hannah frowned deeply, unsettled by his obsession.

Sensing he might be excessive again, Claude's voice softened. "Hannah, could we not make our relationship so unpleasant? Ifyou still think of me as family..."

Her eyes shifted, her guard wavering. She finally relented. "Your mother would never want me there."

"I've spoken to her already," Claude replied quickly,his tone firm. "I told her plainly-I only view you as family.She won't trouble you again."

Hannah picked up her bag and turned to leave. "If I am not busy that day, I'll try to come over."

Claude pressed once more, unwilling to let go."Can we still be like before?"

Hannah paused but didn't look back. Her voice was gentle, yet final. "Claude, as your family, I truly wish you happiness."

With that, she didn't linger a heartbeat longer and walked swiftly out of the restaurant.

 
The warmth drained from Claude's face, leaving only a bitter smile and storm clouds gathering in his eyes.His carefully staged revelation, even the threat of delaying the ceremony, had won him nothing more than her distant courtesy.

Hannah was ruthless-ruthless in the way she drew lines. She could enjoy fireworks and relax by the seaside with Vincent, even considering the offer of a second chance. Yet with him, she showed no softness, no hesitation, not even the shadow of it.Fine. So be it. If tenderness couldn't sway her, then he would have to use sharper means to bind her by his side.

First, he had to secure the Hobbes family's throne fast. Once the engagement was sealed and Evelyn's promised shares delivered, he would push Terrell into retirement, stripping him of all power. And then-the Hobbes empire would be his to command. No one could stop him then.
Meanwhile, Hannah stepped into the evening air, the breeze loosening the knot in her chest little by little.  She was heading toward her car when her eyes caught a familiar Bentley parked at the roadside.

Vincent leaned against the car door, waiting. The moment he saw her, he straightened and pulled open the passenger door.

Hannah approached, a flicker of surprise in her tone."What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 519 Just Like You Did To Me In Front Of Erica
Hannah slipped into the car and buckled her seatbelt. "Was it the bodyguards who told you?"

"Yeah." Vincent slid into the driver's seat, and his hands clenched a little tighter on the wheel. "What exactly did Claude say to you? Mind sharing it with me?"

He worked hard to keep the question from sounding like an interrogation.

Hannah's gaze lingered on the streets behind glass,her voicesteady. "Not much. Only that he's getting engaged, the date is set for next week, and he invited me to witness the ceremony."

Vincent's brows knited in a heartbeat, and he cast her a sharp glance. "Did you say yes?"

"Yeah," Hannah admitted softly. "I think I'll go. After

 
 all, in my parents' eyes, he was always like a son."In her heart, she felt she ought to stand in for her late father and her sick mother, still in recovery.

Vincent held his tongue for a moment. Though the thought soured him, he respected her decision."Even though I don't fancy the idea of you showing up at his celebration, if you feel you must, then go.But promise me-take the bodyguards and stay in touch."

Hannah turned to him, a teasing curve tugging at her lips. "Mr. Jones, why do you sound as though we're already an item? If memory serves, you haven't actually won me over yet, have you?"

Her words stole Vincent's breath for a second. He was about to reply when his eyes caught Claude at the restaurant entrance-fury etched across his face,glaring straight at them.

Vincent's eyes chilled like ice on steel. Instead of answering Hannah, he lowered her window in one swift motion, cupped the back of her head, and  pressed his mouth to hers in a fierce, unannounced kiss.

It was a kiss of claim, a banner raised in open declaration.

Hannah froze, startled, her hands braced against his chest,but he held her closer, unwilling to let go.

Only after a long moment did Vincent finally release her, his thumb brushing over her slightly swollen lips as he gave a roguish smile. "Just like you did to me in front of Erica."

Following his gaze, Hannah turned her head toward the window. Claude stood rooted there, face twisted with rage as he stared at them. In that instant,she understood the reason behind Vincent's sudden boldness.

Vincent no longer spared Claude a glance.He rolled the window back up and steered the car smoothly into traffic.

Hannah leaned back in her seat, silent, her mind still
processing everything that had just happened.

Vincent stole a look at her more than once, his grip on the wheel tightening with each glance. He assumed her silence was born of displeasure over the unexpected kiss.

After a hesitant beat, he spoke first. "Sorry. I acted on impulse. I shouldn't have kissed you without your consent. Please don't be angry with me."

His voice pulled her back from her thoughts. She blinked, surprised, and turned to him, her eyes a little unfocused. "What did you just say?"

Vincent's chest sank like a stone, and he repeated earnestly, "I said I shouldn't have kissed you without your consent. I hope you're not upset with me."

Hannah finally understood, shaking her head wvith a faint, rueful smile. "You think that's what on my mind?"

Vincent's eyes flickered in surprise. "Isn't it?" Seeing her earlier silence, he had assumed she was mad at him.

"I was only thinking about Claude's engagement celebration and wondering whether I should bring you along," Hannah sighed, her brows tightening.

Claude's murderous glare from just now still haunted her. Something in her gut warned her that going alone might mean higher possibilities of facing danger.

Vincent's attention sharpened at once, his eyes glimmering with a sudden light. "So, you're not mad at me?"

Seeing his hopeful look, she felt the heaviness Claude had cast over her heart quietly ease. Turning to face forward, her voice was calm but steady."No."

That single word cut the rope of tension inside Vincent, and relief swept over him, carrying a rush of joy with it. Almost without thinking, he flicked on the indicator and slowly pulled the car to the side of the road. Hannah blinked at him in puzzlement. "What's wrong?"

Vincent unbuckled his seatbelt, turned fully to her,his gaze steady and unwavering. "Then can I have another kiss?"
###Chapter 520 Schemes Are Festering


Vincent leaned in closer as he spoke.

Hannah instantly pressed against his chest, her glare sharp with mild annoyance. "Drive! I want to go home; I'm a bit tired."

Though her words were stern, her ears betrayed her with a faint blush.

Vincent caught sight of her reddened cheeks, noting her struggle to keep composure, and a chuckle escaped him. Fastening his seatbelt, he started the car and said in a gentle tone, "Alright."


***

Meanwhile,Erica was weathering a storm of her own.Irritated beyond measure, she hung up on yet another debt collector, her fury so fierce that she nearly flung the phone against the wall.

A few days back, she had gone abroad with hopes pinned on revision surgery, but her trail had been uncovered, and Vincent's men were onto her.Panicked, she'd altered her plans overnight, bribing the cosmetic clinic with a small fortune to alter her records under Brinley's name. It had been a close call.

But to pull it off, she had drained nearly all her liquid assets, paying only the deposit, with a promise to settle the hefty balance upon returning home.

Lately, however, the shady factories she ran had been bleeding money, and her cash flow was stretched thinner than paper.

The clinic, relentless as a hound on a scent, had hounded her with calls day and night, their voices sharp with impatience, threatening to expose the fraudulent record alteration unless she paid up. It was enough to drive her to the edge of madness.

And as her finances unraveled, so too did her romantic illusions. Vincent now despised her profoundly. Cloaked in Brinley's identity, she had not the faintest chance of ever drawing near to him again.

Losing both money and love, her disappointment festered, her frustration burned, and the weight of it nearly tipped her into insanity.

Her last thread of fantasy about Vincent snapped,replaced by a venomous hatred and smoldering resentment. Why should she sink into ruin, while Hannah remained untouched, perhaps even on the verge of reconciling with Vincent?

A reckless and daring scheme started brewing in her mind. After all, seated close at hand was Logan-a man who bore Vincent's very likeness. If Vincent could somehow be locked up, and Logan trained as her puppet, then the colossal Jones Group would lie within her grasp, provided every step was planned and carried out to perfection.

By then, money, power, and even Vincent himself-everything would bend to her will. The mere thought made her tremble with anticipation. Yet, she wasn't blind to the risks. Vincent was ever wary, surrounded by bodyguards like an iron fortress.To strike at him would be like trying to pluck the stars from the sky. Her plan needed to be crafted with precision and carried out with flawless timing.

At the same time, in a secluded side hall of the Jones estate, Danica hunched over her phone, her tone calm yet calculating. "Coyle, make sure you visit Vincent more often from now on. Earn his favor! For all you know, the future head of theJones Group might be you."

On the other end, Coyle Hopkins-her nephew-sounded utterly taken aback. "Danica, what are you suggesting? Vincent, he..."

Danica cut in firmly. "I am quite certain he can't have children. Mark my words-gain his trust and make him value you! This is a golden chance, not to be squandered."

Whether Vincent was truly childless or not hardly mattered to Danica. Her eyes were fixed only on the prize-the inheritance of the Jones Group. If her nephew Coyle could one day claim that mantle,perhaps her imprisoned brother might find a chance to get out sooner.

For her family's gain, Danica schemed tirelessly,burdened with neither shame nor hesitation.

A few days later, the listening device Hannah had planted on Erica's painting finally bore fruit. Bryant Greville, the surveillance expert she had hired,reported after days of quiet monitoring.

"Ms. Scott, the target received several debt collection calls today. She grew highly agitated and quarreled with the callers. Moreover, she seemed to be jotting or sketching something, murmuring words like 'plan' and 'replacement.' The context, however, is unclear."

Hannah's alertness sharpened at once. "Good.Keep listening. If anything unusual arises, inform me immediately."

Once she ended the call, she relayed everything straight to Vincent. He had just returned to the Jones estate. Upon hearing, his gaze turned icy sharp. "I'll have the maids enter her room under the guise of cleaning. They'll search it thoroughly
###Chapter 521 Danica's Plan


Vincent wasted no time in giving a sharp command.

A servant, operating under the guise of ordinary cleaning, entered Erica's room.

With practiced hands, the servant searched swiftly yet carefully, and before long uncovered several crumpled scraps buried deep within the trash can.

Each paper was littered with chaotic scribbles, whole lines scratched out again and again, the handwriting echoing frustration that nearly bled through the ink.

Yet, amid the mess, a few words stood out-circled heavily, ringed with arrows and question marks that stabbed like accusations. Most striking among them was a single name-Logan Grant.

The moment Vincent learned of this, he snapped a photo and forwarded it to Hannah. Hannah, eyes fixed on the circled name, knit her brows so tightly that they almost touched. "Logan Grant... Could he be Erica's new financial backer? Or perhaps the linchpin she's relying on?"

Vincent's expression hardened, a chill settling over his features. "Whoever he is, since Erica places such weight on him, there must be something unusual. I'll have someone dig into every corner of his past and the web of his connections."

Once the matter was settled, Vincent turned to retire for the night. This was the day of the weekly family dinner at the estate, and he had chosen, as usual,to stay over.

Just as he was about to climb the stairs, Danica appeared, holding a glass of warm milk that gave off gentle steam. "Vincent, are you heading to bed already?" she asked, her face softened by a smile as she held the glass toward him. "No matter how busy your work keeps you, you must still look after your health. Here, drink this milk before sleeping-it will soothe you." The tenderness in her eyes made Vincent pause,suspicion flickering like a shadow across his mind.Yet, he brushed it aside, chalking it up as unusual rather than threatening.
Not wishing to stir conflict over such a trivial offering,he accepted the glass and dutifully drank a few sips.

"Well? How does it taste?" Danica prodded, her gaze locked on him with smiling insistence.

"Not bad," Vincent replied evenly, setting the glass back on the tray.

Her smile brightened, more eager now. "Actually,this milk wasn't from me. It was prepared by your cousin,Coyle. He's been concerned about you, hearing how hard you've been working. He made sure the milk was delivered especially for you-he truly cares."

As she spoke, her hand gestured toward the door.

From outside, Coyle shuffled in, head bowed, a stiff smile tugging at his lips. "Vincent..."

Vincent's gaze shifted between his mother and his cousin, the puzzle fitting together in an instant. Their little game was clear as day. The softness in his features vanished, replaced by cold steel. "Enough circling around. Just say what it is you really want."

For a moment, Danica's smile faltered, but she quickly rallied, playfully chiding, "How can you speak like that? We're family-what could I possibly want?It's only that Coyle is getting older, and idleness won't do. I thought perhaps he could find a place in the Jones Group. Working under you would give him experience."

Vincent held his silence, his eyes glacial as they landed on Coyle, whose hunched shoulders betrayed his lack of confidence.

Sensing the tension thickening, Danica nudged Coyle,urging him on.

Mustering a shaky breath, Coyle finally blurted,"Vincent, could I... Could I get the position of a vice president at the Jones Group?"

The words, once out, seemed to stun even Coyle himself. His face burned as he lowered his head,ashamed by the absurdity of his own request.

The room sank into a heavy silence.

Vincent's lips curled in a cold, mocking arc, as though he had just heard the punchline to a cruel joke. "Vice president? Coyle, do you even grasp what that means? Do you know your own measure? A college dropout, empty-handed in knowledge, dares to dream of sitting in that chair?"

Coyle's face turned deathly pale; his head drooped further, as if he wished the floor might swallow him whole.

Danica's expression had soured with barely contained anger. Struggling to keep her composure,she said, "Must you speak to your cousin like that?He can learn! He's still young, with time enough ahead. Why not give him a chance to grow? You've often said you want to groom a successor,haven't you?I believe Coyle is suitable. If not for him, then at least for my sake-"
"Your 'sake' has never weighed much with me,"Vincent cut her off, his eyes flashing as they bore into he r. "When have you ever shown me such kindness? Since childhood, you've known only how to demand, to press, to scold. When was it ever your habit to bring me milk or speak a gentle word? At times, I truly wonder whether I am your son at all."
###Chapter 522 | Have Only You And Grandma


Vincent felt a hollow ache inside, laced with bitter irony. He could never father children, yet his mother had already chosen someone else to take his throne. It was exactly the sort of ruthless arrangement Danica excelled at.

Vincent's icy skepticism cut across Danica's polished composure like a blade, stripping away the mask she worked so hard to maintain. She snapped back, her voice sharp with indignation, "Who fed you the notion that you're not my flesh and blood? I nearly died giving birth to you, and you dare throw such words at me?Is it that you no longer wish to recognize me as your mother?"

Her outburst left him drowning once more in that same emptiness and bitter irony. His mouth curved into a cold, almost vicious smile. "If I had the choice, I'd rather you never brought me into this world.Oh-how could I forget? How exactly did you claw your way into the Jones family? You plotted against Dad and schemed your way up the ladder. Without giving him a son, would you ever have secured such a smooth path to wealth?"

"You!" Danica's whole body trembled, her son's merciless words ripping open her most shameful scars. Her composure shattered, and with a sharp crack, her palm struck across Vincent's face.

The resounding slap echoed through the wide, pristine living room.

Nearby, Coyle froze in fright, shrinking against the wall, hardly daring to breathe.

Vincent's head tilted from the blow, a livid handprint blooming swiftly across his cheek. Yet, he showed no anger, no reaction beyond pressing his tongue to the numbed inside of his mouth. He didn't so much as glance at Danica again, his gaze turning to ice. Saying nothing more, he spun around and walked out of the Jones house.

Only after the door closed did Coyle dare approach Danica, his voice shaking. "Danica, did you and Vincent really fall out? If that's the case, then l've got even less of a shot at entering the Jones Group-let alone inheriting it."
Danica's chest rose and fell violently. She clenched her teeth, fury roughening her tone. "Absolutely not. As long as I'm his mother, he wouldn't dare go against me. And if he tries, I'll crush that defiance and make damn sure you get into the Jones Group."

The idea of Vincent truly opposing her was something she refused to accept.



Instead of heading back to the office or Sterling Heights, Vincent drove straight to a discreet, members-only bar. The only thing he craved was alcohol strong enough to quiet the storm in his chest.

Glass after glass of liquor scorched its way down his throat, but the icy hollowness inside him remained untouched. He lost track of how much he had poured back.

Then, a shadow slid into the booth beside him-a familiar figure settling into the seat at his side.

"Why are you here drinking by yourself?" Hannah's voice carried a thread of worry as she stepped closer.Too much time had passed without hearing from him, so in her unease, she called Derek, only to uncover that Vincent was holed up here.

Vincent raised his bloodshot gaze to her in silence before tipping his glass back for another swallow.

Before he could pour again, Hannah laid her hand gently over his, stopping the bottle. "Rough night?" she asked softly.

For a moment, Vincent said nothing. Then, he turned his head, his voice low and gravelly. "Hannah,I only have you and Grandma."

His words were quiet, slurred at the edges, but she caught every syllable. Her chest tightened, an ache pressing beneath her ribs. Something terrible must have erupted at the Jones house-she felt it instinctively.

Instead of prying, she lifted another glass, poured herself a measure of liquor, and tapped it gently against his. "Then I'll drink with you."

Half lost in the haze of alcohol, Vincent let fragments of his heart slip free. "After you left, I hardly went back to the Jones house. I just wanted to stay out of her way. Tonight, when she gave me a glass of warm milk,I actually thought maybe-just maybe-she finally cared."

His laugh came out rough, edged with bitterness. "Turns out it was nothing more than a ploy. She wanted me to give her useless nephew the role of vice president, to groom him as the future heir. Tell me, isn't that the most pathetc joke you've ever heard?"

Hannah understood at once that by"her,"Vincent meant Danica. "So this is where you've come to drown the ache in your chest?" Her words carried a soft edge of concern.

"Not at all." Vincent shook his head, and though his words were slurred, his eyes carried a strange, bitter clarity. "I'm glad. Glad I finally see her for who she really is, and I've stopped fooling myself."

From now on, that mother of his would never wound him again.

When Vincent reached for the wine bottle again, Hannah caught his wrist and pushed it down with quiet insistence."Enough already. You're done for tonight. I'm taking you home."

She slipped an arm under his and half-guided, half-dragged him out of the dim bar, struggling against his unsteady weight all the way back to Sterling Heights.

Once there, Vincent stubbornly refused to head into his own apartment. Instead, he trailed after her,insisting on climbing the stairs to her apartment.

At her door, Hannah turned, exasperated but trying to reason with him. "Vincent, we're not even officially together yet,and you're already trying to move in with me? What exactly are you trying to say by that?"
###Chapter 523 Do You Want To Be With Me


Vincent slouched against the doorframe, his alcohol-brightened eyes fixed on Hannah with raw intensity."If you agree, we wouldn't just be dating-we could even remarry."

He paused, voice falling to a low, almost pleading rumble."My place feels like a hollow box, cold and empty.Can I spend the night here instead?"

Hannah's chest tightened, and after a beat, she stepped aside, murmuring,"Alright."

Once Vincent crossed the threshold, he quickly added, "I'll take the couch."

Hannah arched a brow, her tone light. "Okay. Crash wherever you lke."

His gaze locked on her, testing limits with a crooked half-smile. "Then maybe I stay in your bed?"

Hannah shot him down without hesitation, her voice cool and steady. "Not happening. Anywhere but beside me."

Vincent's expression flickered with disappointment, a shadow crossing his face before he quickly masked it.

Noticing that trace of vulnerability, Hannah felt a sudden pang of sympathy. Just as she was about to retreat to her own room, she stopped and turned around, her steps deliberate as she walked toward him. Lifting her gaze to meet his slightly bloodshot eyes, she spoke with quiet firmness. "Vincent, it isn't just me and your grandmother you have. You also have yourself."

Her voice steadied, each word deliberate. "I believe a person must first be whole within themselves-grounded and strong-before they can truly hold on to anything else. Perhaps today, I finally understand why you've been so aloof. Maybe it's because you lost your father too early, your mother never gave you the love you needed, and you had to build walls around yourself just to protect yourself."

A mix of gentleness and resolve threaded through her voice as she continued, "You should be proud of yourself, Vincent. You endured so much and still grew into someone strong and remarkable. You never strayed. Honestly, if I had lived through what you did, I doubt I could've been as strong." Vincent's gaze lingered on her, her words cutting straight through the fog of liquor, as if all the buried pain and bitterness finally had a voice. In a sudden motion, he pulled her into his arms, clutching her tightly, as though desperate to draw every ounce of her warmth and understanding into his hollow chest.

For a long while, Hannah remained still in his embrace, letting him hold her. Only when she felt a faint dampness against her neck did she shift slightly and murmur, her tone soft as a sigh, "Vincent, are you crying?"

Vincent buried his face deeper into the crook of her neck, his words muffled and stubborn. "I don't cry. Not ever."

Hannah let out a quiet, amused laugh, her voice soft but sure. "Liar. You're crying right now."

Easing back from his embrace, she cradled his face between her palms. His brooding eyes were rimmed in red, and a lone tear slipped down his cheek.

On impulse, Hannah rose on her toes and kissed the salty tear away.

Vincent went rigid, the haze of alcohol evaporating in an instant. His pupils widened, shock flashing in his gaze as he stared at her.

When she drew back, she tilted her head, her lips curving into a radiant, mischievous smile. Her voice was clear, almost playful. "Vincent, do you want to be with me-for real?"

He stood frozen, eyes glistening redder than before, barely daring to breathe, terrified even the smallest sound might shatter the fragile, dreamlike moment.

Hannah caught the stunned look in his eyes and, with a playful tilt of her chin, forced her expression into mock severity as she made to step away. "Don't want it? Fine then-pretend I never said a word."

Her teasing lilt barely had time to fade before Vincent jolted back to himself. "No!" He clutched her wrist with desperate urgency, tugging her toward him as though afraid she might vanish. His voice wavered with pent-up excitement. "I couldn't want it more! I've waited so long to hear this from you."

Drawing in a steadying breath, he lowered his gaze, the weight of his sincerity pressing through every word."Hannah, let's seriously and properly have a relationship, okay? No more misunderstandings, no more
secrets. Just us, the way it was when you first showed interest in me. This time, let me love you the way you deserve."

The armor around her heart, hardened for years, crumbled at his earnest plea. Her lips curved into a faint smile."Okay."

That single word broke the dam inside him, unleashing everything he had tried so hard to contain.He could no longer restrain himself; he bent down and captured her lips in a kiss.

This time, it carried none of the old hints of possession or claim, but brimmed with gentleness, quiet joy,and a vow of what was to come.

Every press of his mouth was tender yet fervent, as though he tried to convey all his love and determination through this kiss.

Hannah responded without hesitation, her arms sliding firmly around his neck as she drew him closer.

They had weathered so much together, and she couldn't decide if her yes came from a softened heart in this moment or from love that had never truly faded. Either way, she no longer trembled at the thought of choosing him again.

Uncertaintylingered, but she believed the road ahead would hold its own beauty. She was not the fragile girl she had once been. Strength had taken root in her, enough to face the weight of any choice-even the risk of loving again.
###Chapter 524 Being Taken Away Inside The Underground Garage


From that night on, Hannah and Vincent started spending time as a couple.

Fortune seemed to favor Hannah since then. Both her personal life and her career flourished unexpectedly.

Driven by her unwavering and strategic leadership, the Luminara Group's performance skyrocketed,continuously shattering revenue records. Her seat as CEO grew ever more unshakable, her reputation increasingly respected across the industry.

On this particular afternoon, Hannah wrapped up her tasks with brisk efficiency and made her way to the underground garage, her steps light with cheer.

While making her way toward the car, she slipped on a hands-free device, her lips curving into a relaxed smile while chatting with Vincent. "Alright, I know you're tied up. Aren't you working overtime for a meeting?No need to pick me up. I drove today-I can head home on my own."

From the other end came Vincent's voice, tinged with a hint of playful accusation."We're still in the early days of our relationship, aren't we? Why are you treating your boyfriend so coldly, not even giving me a chance to pick you up?"

Amused by his sudden clinginess, Hannah let out a laugh and flicked her eyes to her watch. "Let me remind you that it's been less than eight hours since we parted this morning."

With a drop in tone, Vincent spoke in sudden solemnity. "Is that so? It feels like forever."

With a soft giggle, she remarked, "Wow, I don't expect you to be this clingy."

"Clingy?" Vincent shot back with faint indignation. "All I want is a little more time with you by my side."

"Alright, alright." Hannah laughed, trying to soothe him. "Now go on. You've got a meeting to run. I'm on my way to meet a client for business discussions."

"A client?" His voice sharpened, tinged with jealousy. "So, in your eyes, that client matters more than I do?" With a light lilt in her tone, Hannah teased,′′Of course. Clients bring me business deals. What about you-can you?"

Her carefree jab left Vincent briefly speechless before he muttered with a trace of exasperation,"A∥you can think about is money."

"Exactly," Hannah replied, cheerful and unbothered. "You nailed it perfectly."

Unable to argue with her, Vincent let out a sot sigh. His tone steadied into something earnest. "My meeting's about to begin. Go see your client, but if you need anything at all, reach out. I'll be there."

Warmth flickered in her chest, though she chose to keep teasing. "Since when did you become so agreeable? You're practically turning into my personal hotline."

"For you," Vincent replied, his voice low and unwavering through the receiver."Only for you."

He had more to say, but before the words could leave him, the line broke into a busy signal.

Suddenly, Vincent's gentle look hardened, his brow drawing into a sharp crease. Something was off.Hannah would never cut the call like that.

He backed out of the call screen and swiftly pulled up her location through the wristband linked to his phone. The upgraded model required no manual input-just the connection to his device was enough to pinpoint her whereabouts.

On the map, her signal hovered in the company's underground garage, then began to drift-but not toward the restaurant she'd mentioned. Instead, it moved steadily toward the city's edge.

A cold weight settled in Vincent's chest. His gut tightened with the certainty that something had gone wrong.

At that moment, Derek stepped into the office, ready to remind Vincent of the upcoming meeting.

Vincent's tone was clipped and urgent. "Push it back. I'm heading out."

Without sparing another word of explanation, Vincent seized his car keys and strode from the office. Inside the underground garage, Hannah had barely touched her car door when a hand ripped her phone from her grasp. Her heart jolted-before she could react, another hand clamped a damp cloth over her nose and mouth. The cloth reeked of a sharp, chemical stench that burned her throat.

She thrashed instinctively, but her strength bled away in seconds. Her vision swam, the world spinning into a haze.

Through the fog, she dimly registered being hauled off the ground, cradled like a parcel, and shoved into the backseat of a wide, leather-lined vehicle.

The engine purred to life, and the car rolled out of the garage with unnerving smoothness.

A hand grazed over her cheek, fingers lingering in a way that made her stomach twist, but she no longer had the strength to fight it. Her eyelids grew impossibly heavy, her consciousness slipping deeper into darkness.

The black limousine slid soundlessly onto the road, carrying her away toward the desolate outskirts.

From the back seat, Claude kept Hannah's head nestled gently on his lap. His gaze clung obsessively to her sleeping face, fingertips gliding over the soft arcs of her brows, brushing her closed eyes, tracing the bridge of her nose before finally pausing at her lips.

Bending closer, he breathed in the delicate fragrance of her hair, his expression twisting with a sickly blend of satisfaction and possessive hunger.

"Mr.Hobbes, we're nearly there," the bodyguard murmured from the front seat.

Claude straightened reluctantly, a flicker of irritation and regret darkening his eyes. The drive was too fast. If only this road could stretch into eternity-just Hannah and him, without any interruptions.

"Fine," Claude said at last, his tone calm, his hand pulling back as his usual mask of composure returned."Go straight to the dressing room. Have everything ready."
###Chapter 525 Force Her To Marry Him


Hannah stirred awake, roused by a disorienting tugging and the murmur of unfamiliar voices.

When her heavy eyelids finally lifted, she found herself ringed by strange women. They bustled about,fussing over her hair and face as if preparing a porcelain doll.

It took a moment for her senses to align, but then, she realized she was seated before a large makeup mirror. The same business suit she had worn from work still clung to her body, though half her makeup had been scrubbed away.

"Where am I? Who are you?" Hannah demanded sharply, pushing to rise-only to discover her limbs were weak, as though chained by invisible weights.

The lead stylist, noticing her struggle, gave a polished professional smile.′′Ms. Scott, you're awake. This is the makeup room for the engagement celebration. We're here to prepare you for the event."

"Engagement celebration?" Hannah's heart dropped like a stone, dread rising in her chest. "Whose engagement celebration?"

The stylist blinked, surprised at the question, yet answered dutifully, "It's Mr. Hobbes' engagement celebration."

At that moment, a stylist assistant entered carrying an exquisite white wedding dress. She spoke softly,almost reverently. "Ms. Scott, your makeup and hairstyle are nearly finished. It's time to change into the wedding gown."

"Wedding gown?" Hannah's gaze froze on the dazzling fabric, her voice trembling with barely contained fury."Why on earth should I wear a wedding gown?"

She forced herself to steady her breath, though her mind raced like a wheel out of control. She must have been drugged and dragged here by Claude. But wasn't this supposed to be his engagement with Bonnie?Could it be that he intended to force her into this ceremony instead? Doubts and suspicions flooded in like a storm tide, and Hannah's face drained of color.

Several stylists moved forward, trying to drape the luxurious gown onto Hannah's shoulders.

But Hannah fought like a cornered bird, scratching one stylist assistant's arm with her nails in desperation."Let go of me! I won't wear it! Get away from me!" Her voice cut the room like glass.

With a crash, the door burst open. Claude strode in, his sharp gaze sweeping across the chaos before fixing on Hannah. His brow creased. "What's happening? Why isn't she in the wedding gown yet?"

The moment Hannah saw him, her fury found its mark. "Claude, have you lost your mind? What on earth are you trying to do?" Her whole body shook with rage. "This is abduction-illegal confinement! I'll call the police and have you thrown in jail!"

Claude, as if hearing a child's wild claim, gave a soft chuckle and walked toward her. He schooled his expression into a mix of grievance and false innocence. "Call the police? Abduction? Anna, I sent you an invitation. Today is my engagement celebration. Yet, you ignored me and refused even a reply. I had no choice but to fetch you myself. How could that be kidnapping?".

He spread his hands with a hint of smugness. "Besides, who would believe it? I erased the garage surveillance. When the police arrive, all they'll hear is my version-that you came of your own accord and simply changed your mind."

Hannah's heart plummeted. His calm confidence told her exactly why he dared act so boldly. She forced herself to think clearly. Her safety wristband was still fastened to her wrist, and Vincent had her location.Her only hope was that he would come quickly.

Her silence emboldened Claude, who mistook it for reluctant surrender. He stepped closer, pressing both hands on her shoulders and pushing her back into the makeup chair. Leaning down, he studied her exquisitely painted face through the mirror. "Be good, Anna. I won't harm you. I only want you to attend my engagement celebration."

Hannah's glare seared back at him from the mirror. "Attend your engagement? Claude, don't twist words!You're forcing them to put me in a wedding gown! If I'm right, this so-called engagement is actually meant for me. You want to force me into it, don't you?" For a fleeting moment, excitement and regret danced in his eyes. He laughed softly, tracing a finger along her cheek. "Clever as always. Yes, I dream of turning this dull engagement into our wedding this very instant."

But then, his voice shifted, restrained by cold reason. "Sadly, I can't. The risk is too great. So, for now,rest easy. All I ask is that you wear the gown and stand at my side during the celebration."

Hannah's disbelief burned through her calm façade. "If it's just attendance, then why the wedding gown?Why all this grandeur?"

Claude's gaze turned feverish as his fingers caressed the hem of the gown. "Because I want to see you in it.You must look like a bride-my bride. Nothing less will do."

Claude was determined to see Hannah in a wedding gown for him, even if it was at his engagement celebration with another woman.
###Chapter 526 You Belong To Me Alone


Claude lowered his voice, his words carrying a fervent weight. "And today, I want everyone here to see, to grasp without a shadow of doubt that you, Hannah, are the only one who matters to me, Claude. Even that soon-to-be fiancée of mine cannot shake your place by so much as an inch."

Hannah tried to reason with him, her tone steady but troubled. "Don't you fear that Bonnie will see me like this and grow jealous? Wouldn't that ruin your own engagement party?"

At her words, Claude's lips curved into a cold, arrogant smile. "What reason does she have to be jealous?You attend my engagement ceremony merely as family. I've already made it clear to the Sandoval family-l have a sisterly figure who grew up by my side, someone dear to me, and I want her present to witness my happiness. They agreed. If Bonnie cannot endure such a bond, it only proves her immature, unworthy of joining the Hobbes family."

"You're insane.. Utterly out of your mind!" Hannah felt a chill rising from her feet to her chest.

"Insane?" Claude's eyes darkened, menacing and bottomless. He leaned close, his breath brushing her ear."If I were truly insane, I'd drive out every guest this very moment, tear apart this engagement, and turn it into our wedding instead. Anna, you're right. I am half-mad... But I'm still holding back. So don't test me.Prepare yourself. I'll be waiting for you."

As he spoke, his sharp gaze landed on Hannah's wrist. Seizing her moment of distraction, he swiftly tore the security wristband from her.

"Give that back!" Hannah's face drained of color as she lunged for it.

Claude sidestepped easily, clenching the security wristband in his hand, his smile sharp as frost."I know you sent your location to Vincent. This little trinket, I'll be keeping it. Don't place your hopes on him saving you. Today,you belong to me alone."

He allowed no room for protest, signaling to the stylists nearby.
The stylists came forward at once, ignoring Hannah's frantic resistance. They pressed her into a custom-fitted, figure-hugging mermaid wedding dress, fastening every clasp, every zip, smoothing each detail until it clung perfectly to her frame.

When at last they finished, the mirror reflected Hannah draped in bridal white, her face like a sheet of ice.

Claude's eyes shone with admiration and satisfaction. "Beautiful," he said with genuine praise before gesturing to his assistants. "Take her to the ceremony."

Two bodyguards in black suits "escorted" Hannah-almost by force-out of the dressing room and toward the grand hall already brimming with guests.

Just as they turned a corner in the corridor, Hannah suddenly came face to face with another figurein a wedding dress-Bonnie.

In that instant, both women froze.

Hannah's eyes widened, disbelief washing over her as she saw Bonnie wearing the exact same wedding gown. The style, the fabric, the details-every stitch was identical.

Yet, the dress, clearly tailored for Hannah's figure, sagged and gaped on Bonnie. The bust hung loose, the waist misaligned, making her seem like a child awkwardly swallowed in her mother's clothes, exuding only discomfort and embarrassment.

Bonnie, too, looked at Hannah. Her face paled for a fleeting moment, but she quickly forced back her composure.

And then, Hannah understood it all. Claude's plan was laid bare-he wanted not only her presence, but Bonnie's public humiliation. Before all the guests, he meant to declare his obsession with her without disguise.

Claude seemed deaf to the murmurs spreading through the crowd, blind to the strange, questioning stares.With a faint smile of twisted delight, he strode to Hannah, slipping her arm into his with force, locking her in place. "Be good, Anna. It's only ceremony, nothing more. Soon, it will pass. Now smile-it's supposed to be the happiest day of my life."
###Chapter 527 Go On Stage Arm In Arm


The guests below craned their necks as Claude led Hannah forward, and instantly, the hall erupted in a storm of whispers.

The murmurs, once suppressed, now spilled out like water breaking through a dam.

"What on earth is happening? Two identical wedding gowns? Is Claude really planning to marry two women?"

"Heavens above! Poor Ms. Sandoval, what disgrace! What kind of fiancé flaunts another woman at his own engagement party, and that woman dressed exactly like his soon-to-be fiancée?"

"I can't make sense of this. Who is Claude truly getting engaged to? Who is that woman at his side? I've never seen her before. This is sheer madness! The Hobbes family will be the butt of every joke!"

Dragged forward under the spotlight, Hannah felt the heat of countless stares pressing down on her,and her chest swelled with anger. Lowering her voice, she hissed, "Claude, is this truly what you want? To make your own family a laughingstock? Do you really find such folly amusing?"

Claude turned toward her, a twisted smile curling with satisfaction. "Let them gape and comment. Their laughter means nothing to me. Anna, as long as you're by my side, I'm content."

He had stepped clean out of the realm of reason. Realizing words would only fall on deaf ears, Hannah pressed her lips tight, enduring as he dragged her to the center of the stage like a trophy.

On stage, the Hobbes family members had faces dark as thunderclouds.

Evelyn trembled with rage, finally losing her composure. She strode forward, her voice sharp yet low."Claude, this is outrageous! Take her off the stage at once!" Her finger stabbed toward Hannah, her eyes a storm of disdain and alarm.

Claude,however, turned to his mother with a calculatedly innocent expression, his voice even tinged with measured grievance. "Mom, I only wanted my sister Anna close by, to witness my moment of joy. Is that truly ao wrong? Plus, didn't you already agree with her presence?"

It was true-Evelyn had once consented to Hannah's attendance. But never, not in her worst imaginings,had she thought it would spiral into such an absurd scene. Claude had put Hannah in the same gown as his soon-to-be flancée and dragged her onto the stage in front of everyone. If word spread, both the Hobbes and Sandoval families would be ridiculed beyond repair.

"You've stalled this entire ceremony just to wait for her? Just so she could don this gown?" Evelyn's voice shook like a bowstring pulled too tight.

Claude dodged her fury, turning instead to the pale, trembling Bonnie beside him. In a voice dressed in false gentleness, he asked, "Bonnie, you agreed to this as well, didn't you? I said I wished Anna could bless us up close. You agreed, didn't you?"

Bonnie bit her lip until it nearly bled, her voice shrinking to a whisper. "Yes... Claude asked me, and l...agreed."

Bonnie dared not oppose Claude. His grip on her family's future was a chain she could not break.

Beside them, Terrell's face burned red with humiliation. He could bear no more of this circus. Waving impatiently, he barked, "Enough! End this nonsense! Haven't we lost enough face already? Officiant,begin the ceremony!"

Hannah seized the moment like a lifeline. Forcing a polite smile, she nodded slightly toward Claude and Bonnie.Her voice rang clear."My congratulations to you both. I've witnessed this precious moment with my own eyes. May you share harmony and long years together. I shall return to my seat and watch from the audience."

With that, she turned to leave.

But Claude's hand clamped firmly around her arm, holding her in place. His smile was soft, but his voice brooked no refusal. "Why the hurry, Anna? The most.important part has yet to come-the exchange of engagement rings. And as my 'family,' how could you possibly miss it?"

Hannah swallowed down her anger and the sting of humiliation, speaking as calmly as she could to draw the line. "Claude, this is your engagement with Ms. Sandoval. I'm only here to witness it. The ceremony is
complete. I'll sit below; there's no need for me to witness up close further."

Yet, Claude acted as if her words were carried away by the wind. Still clinging to her arm, he insisted, "No, I want you here until the very end. For I have something prepared for you, too."

His gaze flicked toward an assistant waiting nearby, who immediately stepped forward, presenting a velvet box with both hands.

At that instant, a spark lit in Hannah's mind. She snatched the microphone from the officiant's hand.

Her action drew every eye in the hall.

Steadying herself with a forced smile, Hannah announced, "It seems my brother is so overwhelmed with excitement that his words have grown incoherent. So, while we have the chance,allow me-as his sister-to guide the next part as host."

By becoming the officiant, she could wrest back control of the scene.
###Chapter 528 Her Ex-husband Here To Take Her Away


Hannah cut Claude off before he could react, her voice carrying across the hall like a bell. "Now, let's give a warm round of applause and welcome tonight's stars-Mr. Claude Hobbes and Ms. Bonnie Sandoval-to exchange their engagement rings. May their love stand the test of time and their hearts remain steadfast."

With that single move, Hannah skillfully steered everyone's attention back to the ceremony.

Claude's face clouded at once. Yet, with so many eyes fixed on him, he swallowed the fury rising in his chest. He could not afford to lose control here-his alliance with the Sandoval family was the lynchpin of his grand design.

Jaw clenched, Claude accepted the ring box from his assistant, pulled out the diamond ring meant for Bonnie, and slipped it onto her finger with rigid formality.

Bonnie responded in kind, her movements stiff, her eyes hollow.

The exchange felt icy, less a celebration of love than a bargain struck under duress.

The moment it ended, Hannah lifted the microphone again. "Well then, I declare the engagement ceremony of Mr. Claude Hobbes and Ms. Bonnie Sandoval complete."

"Not so fast." Claude broke in, snatching the microphone from her grasp and tossing it back to the officiant.

He gazed at Hannah, and from his assistant's hands, took another ring box-far more ornate than the first.Opening it, he revealed a ring unlike any other.

Presenting it with deliberate gravity, Claude announced, "Anna, this is the ring I prepared for you."

Gasps rippled through the hall like a sudden storm. A ring for his sister, at his own engagement, no less.This was beyond absurd!

Hannah's eyes locked on the dazzling ring, a chill searing up her spine. "Claude, have you lost your mind?Why are you giving me a ring?" Claude forced a strained smile, his words cloaked in a flimsy excuse."|t′Sonly a token-symbolizing our unbreakable sibling bond."

"She doesn't want it." A cold, commanding voice rang out from the entrance.

Every head turned. The double doors of the banquet hall swung wide as two bodyguards in black pushed through.

Vincent entered, clad in a dark coat, his expression stern and unyielding. He strode forward with an aura so forceful that guests instinctively turned their heads, whispers crackling like fire in his wake.

"Mr. Jones? What is he doing here?"

"Don't you know? That so-called 'sister' Claude is holding on stage is actually Mr. Jones' ex-wife,Hannah Scott!"

"My goodness! Is her ex-husband hereto take her away? What a spectacle!"

The instant Vincent appeared, Hannah felt her tightly coiled nerves loosen. Her first instinct was to wrench free from Claude and run to Vincent.

But Claude's grip on Hannah's wrist tightened cruelly, pain shooting through her bones. He yanked her back, forcing a smile as he addressed the approaching Vincent, "Mr. Jones! What an unexpected honor.Welcome to my engagement ceremony."

Vincent halted just steps away from them, his eyes darting from Claude's crushing hold on Hannah to her strained face. He ignored Claude's hollow greeting and spoke with a blade-like clarity. "Who ever said I came to witness your engagement?" His gaze sharpened, each word striking like a hammer. "I came to take my girlfriend home."

"Girlfriend?" Claude echoed with mock surprise, though the frost in his eyes betrayed him. "Since when did you have a girlfriend? Why has no one heard of this?"

"Since days ago." Vincent's reply was clipped, leaving no room for doubt.

Then, without hesitation, he stepped forward, seized Hannah's other arm, and with one swift motion, tore her free. The movement was clean, sharp, unstoppable-freeing Hannah from Claude's grasp and securely shielding her behind him.

Claude's hand grasped at air, his expression souring by the second.

Vincent stood before Hannah like a wall, his eyes narrowing on the mermaid wedding gown that clung to her form. His face hardened, his presence dark as a gathering storm. "Did he make you wear this?"
###Chapter 529 More Obedient Than Her


The tension in the air was so sharp that it could have cut glass, and the temperature in the room seemed to plummet.

Sensing the storm within Vincent, Hannah gently pressed down on his arm. She gave a slight shake of her head, her eyes calm yet resolute. "Let me handle this."

Stepping out from Vincent's shadow, Hannah's gaze swept the room and landed on a glass of champagne resting on a waiter's tray. Without the faintest hesitation, she seized it and, with a sharp flick of her wrist,flung the icy liquid straight across Claude's face.

Golden drops streamed dowvn from Claude's well-groomed hair to his cheeks, soaking into the pristine white of his suit. The man who prided himself on elegance now stood in utter disarray.

A hushed silence fell across the room; no one dared even breathe.

Hannah casually discarded the empty glass, her eyes glacial as they locked onto Claude. Her voice, laced with warning, cut through the stillness. "Claude, for the sake of our childhood friendship, I'll only splash you a glass of wine this time. But if you dare try such vile tricks to forcefully take me away again, you won't get off so lighly."

Her fury burned cold, her eyes gleaming with unyielding determination.

Then, without waiting for Claude's reply, she did something that left the crowd even more stunned.With both hands, she clutched the ornate hem of her wedding gown-and tore it in one fierce motion.

The sharp rip of fabric echoed through the hall.

The gown that once swept the floor in luxury was now stripped to a knee-length dress, its grandeur discarded.

She tossed the torn fabric aside as if casting away refuse. Turning, she seized Vincent's hand, her voice steady and commanding. "Let's go." Vincent's fingers tightened around hers, his gaze sweeping coldly across the hall.

At Vincent's silent cue, his bodyguards stepped forward, cutting off any who might block their way.

Hannah and Vincent strode toward the exit, hand in hand, never sparing a backward glance at the chaos or the Hobbes family's darkened faces.

The bodyguards cleared a path for them like blades through undergrowth. The sight was like a pair of warriors breaking their chains, bold and resolute.

Back in the banquet hall, champagne dripped from Claude's cheeks. He licked the remnants from his lips,and instead of fury, a wild light of excitement flickered in his eyes. This was Hannah, the woman he loved.She was thorned, never yielding. Even cornered, she found the strength to strike back. The process of conquering her would make his blood boil.

Evelyn and Terrell swallowed their humiliation, busy soothing guests, desperate to salvage a shred of dignity for the Hlobbes family.

Bonnie drew in a deep breath, fighting for composure. She 'stepped forward, slipped her trembling hand through Claude's arm, and forced a fragile smile. "Claude, shall we... Shall we toast the guests?"

She tried, against all odds, to stitch this farce back together.

Claude turned, his gaze sweeping over her pale, compliant face. A smile curved his lips, but it carried no warmth."Alright."

He lifted his hand and patted Bonnie's head, his tone filled with faint approval. "You've been very obedient today."

He inwardly commented that Bonnie was much more obedient than Hannah.

Bonnie's body flinched with fear, but Claude didn't give a damn.


******

Outside, the night air was cool, brushing away the suffocating tension of the hall. Vincent clasped Hannah's hand firmly, his stride quick and unrelenting.

Only when they were well away from the building did he stop, pulling her into his arms. His embrace was iron-strong, his voice trembling with a hint of lingering fear he could not hide. "I never should have listened to you and sent the two bodyguards to book that restaurant."

Vincent's stomach churned with remorse. It was Hannah's decision to dismiss her bodyguards to reserve the restaurant for the client meeting. Alone, she had been vulnerable-easy prey for abduction. Had the bodyguards been at her side, the whole kidnapping incident would never have happened.

Hannah could feel Vincent's heart hammering in his chest, each beat carrying his terror. Gently, she patted his back, her voice calm as still water. "It's over now. Look at me-I'm safe, not even a scratch."

Slowly, Vincent loosened his hold. His hands cupped her face, searching for the smallest trace of harm,and finally sighed in relief when finding none. Yet, his brow remained deeply furrowed. "He took your security wristband and shut it off. The tracking signal went dead. I almost turned the entire city upside down looking for you."

His voice rasped, hoarse from strain. "I barged into several places that might be hosting events before finally finding this one. Yet, I was still late."

He dreaded to imagine what would have happened if he'd come even a minute later. Who knew what madness that lunatic might have tried?

Hannah saw the red veins threading Vincent's eyes, his anxious face laid bare. Her heart softened. She shook her head gently. "Honestly, even if you hadn't arrived, Claude wouldn't have dared harm me. At most,he'd use those maddening tricks to force me to bend to his will, feeding that twisted need for control."

By saying so, she wanted to stop Vincent from drowningin self-reproach.

But Vincent caught the subtle undertone of her words, and his brows drew even tighter."You didn't want me to come?"
###Chapter 530 Let's Live Together


Hannah slowly shook her head, her eyes locked on Vincent's with quiet sincerity. "That's not what I mean.I had been waiting for you to come. I'm truly grateful you came."

At her earnest reply, the taut lines on Vincent's face softened, his eyes revealing both relief and a trace of joy. His gaze drifted again to the wedding gown draped on her, and with undisguised disdain, he muttered,"This dress is hideous."

Hannah looked down at the tattered fabric and allowed herself a playful jest.′′|st? I think once it's torn, it looks rather one-of-a-kind. Maybe I was meant to dabble in fashion design?"

But Vincent could not force even the ghost of a smile. He reached out, pinched a bit of the frayed cloth between his fingers, and his eyes darkened. "What I can't bear is seeing you in something that came from Claude."

The thought that Claude had specifically prepared this for Hannah was like a thorn lodged in Vincent's heart, stirring up a storm of discomfort and resentment.

"Are you jealous?" Hannah lifted a brow at him.

"A little," Vincent confessed without hesitation, his tone edged with sulkiness.

Hannah sighed."Well,you'll have to put up with it for now. Until I reach home and change, this is all I have."

Before her words had even settled, Vincent drew her closer, turning her to face him. Without a moment's pause,he stripped off his black coat and wrapped it firmly over her shoulders.

The oversized garment swallowed her frame, cloaking the glaring wedding dress entirely.

"There," he said with a confident air, satisfaction threading through his voice, "much better."

Once back at Hannah's residence in Sterling Heights, Vincent busied himself in the kitchen to whip up a simple bowl of noodles. Later, watching Hannah sit in fresh home clothes after a shower, eating quietly, Vincent felt the day's knots inside him finally loosen. His gaze never left her, as if he could never get enough of looking at her.

A bit shy under his steady eyes, Hannah laughed softly."Why are you staring at me? Is there something on my face?"

Vincent's reply was plain, yet brimming with tenderness. "You're beautiful. I simply can't look away."

A gentle warmth surged in Hannah's chest. Glancing at the clock on the wall, she gently reminded him,"|t′S late. You should go home now. After such a nerve-wracking day, we both need rest."

Vincent frowned. "That's my line. I should be saying that to you." After all, it was Hannah who had borne the brunt of everything, startled and tossed into the storm.

Yet, Hannah only shook her head, her tone calm, almost matter-of-fact. "I've been through worse.Compared to that, tonight is nothing.I can handle it."

For a fleeting moment, a flash of sympathy passed through Vincent's eyes.

When Hannah finished her noodles, she placed the bowl aside. "I really need some sleep. Aren't you heading home?"

She once again made it clear he should leave.

Vincent remained silent for a while, as though weighing something heavy. Then, in a voice low and solemn,he said, "Hannah, let's live together."

Hannah, who was about to tidy up the table, paused, turning toward him in surprise. "Why bring this up so suddenly?"

He rose, walked over to her, his expression filled with urgency and sincerity. "I just want more time with you.To protect you better. We can have separate rooms, or if you prefer, you can move into my place."

The fear from what could have happened in today's incident still gnawed at him; the thought of Claude trying something even more reckless next time was unbearable. What if he failed to reach her in time?

Hannah saw the raw concern in his eyes and understood his intent, yet the proposal struck her as abrupt."I understand your worry. But don't you think it's too soon? We've only just started again."

"It's alright to say no," Vincent said quckly, softening his tone so as not to press her. "I'm not forcing you.Just think about it. When you feel ready, let me know. I only wanted to put it out there."

Hannah nodded lightly. "Alright, I'll consider it."

Her words were not a refusal, and that alone gave Vincent some peace of mind. He didn't linger. After a few final reminders, he left her home.


******

Elsewhere, Erica's days grew bleaker by the hour.

To cover the crushing debt from the cosmetic surgery hospital, she had milked hundreds of thousands from Danica with the excuse of investing in a new project. But it was a drop in the ocean.

Driven to desperation, Erica had even ordered some thugs from her shadowy factories to try to stalk or abduct Vincent-foolishly imagining she could lock him up and use Logan as a pawn to command the Jones Group. Yet, Vincent's bodyguards were veterans, sharp as blades. Those thugs were taken down in an instant and handed over to the police before they even neared him.

Therefore, her harebrained scheme collapsed before it could breathe.

As the final debt deadline from the cosmetic surgery hospital loomed, her phone rang with menacing calls,voices threatening to reveal her forged documents and fraud.

Pushed to the brink, Erica had no choice but to secretly sell off portions of her shady factories, scraping together enough money to temporarily settle the enormous debt.

But what she never foresaw was that in trying to liquidate assets and raise such a sum, she would draw the watchful eye of an underworld boss.
###Chapter 531 Weakness


Deep into the night, Erica had just returned from outside when a cluster of expressionless figures in black surrounded her porch. In eerie silence, they cloaked her head in dark fabric and forcefully hurled her into a waiting vehicle, transporting her to an isolated and exclusive establishment.

The fabric was yanked off violently.

Drenched in dread, Erica realized she was kneeling in a suffocating chamber, eyes locking with a chillingly composed young man seated in authority. This man was Brixton Ward, the underground boss overseeing the illegal deals across the district. He had been expanding his operations abroad but had returned recently.

Erica trembled, her thoughts scrambling wildly.

Brixton twisted a razor-sharp blade between his fingers, his voice smooth but threatening. "You've changed your appearance quite thoroughly, but why has your brain become stupid? What gave you the nerve to sell off my operations?"

Terror overtaking her, Erica sobbed out broken pleas, "Mr. Ward! Please forgive me! I truly know my mistake!Allow me another opportunity! I swear! I'll push the remaining plants to higher profits. And I'll repay the losses tenfold, a hundredfold! Just let me prove myself!"

"Prove yourself?" Brixton echoed darkly, like someone hearing a joke too absurd to comprehend. He flicked his wrist, letting the blade's flat edge graze her cheek coldly, his words frozen. "I picked you back then because you showed brains, boldness, and managerial instinct. That's why I left you in charge. But while I have been abroad these two years, what have you accomplished? Which project turned a gain? Hmm?The cosmetic overhaul you went through drained the blood, sweat, and tears from those factory crews!"

Erica reeled in disbelief-how could he know these details? Weren't those plant supervisors her handpicked loyalists?

Brixton's smirk deepened, cruelty twinkling at the corners of his mouth, as if he'd plucked the thought from her skull. "Shocked? You believed managing the factories made the crew your men? That you have their loyalty? How naïve. From the day you took over, youur every move has been under my watch!"

A wave of despair drowned Erica. She collapsed forward, begging with her head low, "Mr. Ward, I was wrong! I won't repeat it! I swear! Please-give me just thirty days! I'll revive the remaining factories! Please,I'm begging you!"

But Brixton's glare stayed razor-edged, steeped in frost and murderous silence. He slowly rose to his feet,looming above her like judgment personified. "Regrettably for you, no more chances remain."

His fingers waved once, and the men nearby-who had watched Erica like predators waiting to pounce-stepped forward with wicked, lecherous laughter.

"She's all yours," Brixton said with chilling detachment.′′When you're done, ensure she learns regret like it's carved in bone."

"Understood!" came their enthusiastic chorus, as restless hands stretched forward and tore at Erica's clothing.

"No! Please, stop!" Erica shrieked, thrashing wildly, consumed by raw terror.

And then, just before her clothes were ripped, she wailed with all the strength in her lungs, "Vincent Jones!Mr.Ward! I swear I'm Vincent's aunt! Vincent, the CEO of the Jones Group! He'll give you money! Lots and lots of it! Enough to fix everything!"

She desperately clung to this, hoping it could save her from this nightmare.

Brixton, who was already moving toward the exit, halted mid-step. He lifted his arm, signaling those men to stop.

Silence took over the room-except for Erica's heavy breathing and sobbing.

Brixton retraced his steps, stopped in front of her, crouched down, and nudged her tear-soaked face upward with the butt of his blade, a sliver of mocking curiosity flickering in his stare. "So? You finally mention Vincent?"

He had known long ago-but had waited for her to bring it up, hoping she'd toss it out when she was desperate enough.

Erica shuddered once more; he knew that too? She no longer dared to conceal a thing, desperately trying to increase her worth in his eyes. "Yes! I'm his aunt! You've heard of the Jones Group, right? They're richer than some nations! Let me go, and I'll make sure he pays an enormous amount! Enough to cover all the losses and even more! Money that never stops flowing!"

Brixton let out a low laugh, but his eyes stayed skeptical. "Sure, the Jones Group is a giant-but you? Just an aunt in name, no real blood, not even included in the family inner circle. Do you think your influence is worth anything? You think he'd cough up real cash because of you?"

Erica's chest thudded with dread; she knew this was the most critical moment. And she had to throw out the most weighty bargaining chip. She looked up, her expression turning fierce with raw urgency. "He has a weakness, Mr. Ward! One that could destroy him!"

###Chapter 532 The Hidden Bug


Brixton arched an eyebrow, finally betraying a trace of interest. "Let's hear it."

With a casual flick of his hand, the two men restraining Erica eased their grip a little.

Erica sucked in a trembling breath and blurted out, "Hannah Scott! She's Vincent's ex-wife-and the woman he's completely besotted with right now! He'd walk through fire for her! If we take Hannah as a hostage,there's no way he won't bend, no way he won't pay! He'll hand over whatever we demand!"

Brixton paused, weighing her words carefully. He'd caught murmurings of Hannah, and word on the street claimed Vincent was completely tied up with her.

Brixton's thoughts never strayed far from money, and if seizing one woman could turn into a fortune, it was a gamble worth weighing.

"Just one woman? You really believe he'd pay such a heavy price for her?" Brixton asked, his gaze sharp as a hawk circling its prey, searching Erica's face for any hint of deception.

Erica pressed on, her voice unsteady yet desperate. "As long as it involves Hannah! He will, I swear it!|swear on my life!"

Brixton scrutinized her for several heartbeats, his mind turning the risk and the payoff over like two sides of a coin. In the end, greed tipped the balance. He rose to his feet and gestured toward a man nearby."Scorpio, take a few men and follow her lead for now. Remember-the money is all that matters. Keep it neat -no bloodshed."

A scar-faced mnan with a glint of ice in his eyes gave a curt nod. "Understood."

Brixton cast Erica one last frigid glance. "Erica, this is your final chance. Screw it up again and you know what awaits you."

Relief washed over Erica like air to a drowning soul. She nodded frantically. "Thank you, Mr. Ward! Thank you! I won't disappoint you! I'll deliver Hannah to you and get Vincent's money!" As Brixton walked out, Erica collapsed onto the floor, gasping for breath.

Once she slipped out of the club, she made straight for the Jones estate. Inside her room, she bolted the door and sank against it, her frame quivering beyond her control. The terror lingered... Everything she had just endured felt like a nightmare given flesh. She could still feel those rough hands pawing at her, those ravenous eyes crawling over her as though she were prey already caught.

Once, when fortune in the underworld stilsmiled on her, she had been treated like royalty-untouchable,above fear, spared every humiliation. Now, she was nothing more than hunted prey, cornered and trembling -one step away from being gang-raped.

She rushed into the bathroom, turned the water to searing hot, and scoured her skin again and again until it burned red and raw.

But dread's cold grip and disgust's foul scent seeped into her very bones, beyond the reach of soap or steam.

She needed money. A mountain of it. If the plan with Hannah's kidnapping collapsed, or if Brixton's patience snapped, she had to secure a way out-enough to vanish and begin anew somewhere.

Still dripping, Erica staggered barefoot from the bathroom and tore through her belongings in a frenzy,searching for anything of worth. Her jewelry, her luxury bags... Even the painting she had intended for Sharon but rejected.

As she lifted the painting to wrap it, a small black object slipped from a hidden gap in the frame and landed softly on the carpet.

At first, Erica thought it was just a loose clip or a splintered piece of the frame. She bent instinctively to pick it up.

But the moment it rested in her palm, her heart missed a beat. This was no part of the frame. The shape, the wiring-it was a miniature bugging device.

The truth struck her like a bolt from the blue. That day at the gallery-Hannah had appeared from nowhere and "happened" to bid against her for this very painting! Could it be that Hannah had never wanted the painting at all but had planted this bug inside it?
###Chapter 533 Found The Shady Factories


Erica's pupils widened. So that was why Hannah always seemed one step ahead of her. It turned out she had been under Hannah's monitor all along without even realizing it.

A chill of fury ran through Erica, as though ice had seeped into her veins. She had been tricked,monitored like prey, and the realization burned.

Her first impulse was simple and raw-to toss the tiny device straight into the toilet and flush it away,erasing the insult in an instant.

But just as her hand rose, a darker thought crept in, sharper than her anger.

She halted, staring at the little listening device resting in her palm. A cold smile, cruel and twisted, slowly stretched across her lips. Throwing it away? That would be far too easy for Hannah. This little bug might yet serve a purpose.

Erica's mind began to spin with schemes. She would not discard it-she would turn it into bait, a trap to lure Hannah into.

******

Meanwhile, Erica's sudden decision to sell off her factories and amass a great deal of cash had not gone unnoticed. Vincent's team had been carefully tracking her financial moves and thus immediately flagged the activity.

They wasted no time in reporting their findings. Vincent, grim-faced, carried the preliminary gathered information on Erica's suspicious factories straight to Hannah for review.

Hannah carefully examined the documents: accounts that looked normal at first glance, yet carried contradictions and financial oddities; blurred surveillance photos that seemed ordinary but hinted at mnore beneath the surface. At last, the truth struck her. "So all that money Erica squandered-on plastic surgeries,on bribes, on her reckless whims-comes from these shady factories?"
"Exactly," Vincent replied, his tone as cold as steel. "And according to the trail we've pieced together, the factory where we previously found evidence of Alice being schemed against is likely one of Erica's assets,which is operating under her orders."

Hannah laid the papers down with deliberate calm, though her eyes shone with resolve. "Then we can't waste another moment. Erica must face justice. I'll organize this evidence and send it to Gavin. He can launch a formal investigation and move to have her arrested."

"I'm already ahead of you," Vincent said, his voice steady but carrying a weight of urgency. "The data has been encrypted and sent to Gavin. He's treating this matter with utmost seriousness. He's already dispatched people to dig into it. But there's a problem-the factories mask themselves as legitimate businesses. On paper, their daily operations are spotless. Direct evidence will be hard to come by. Gavin is considering sending someone undercover to collect proof. So don't be anxious. It's only a matter of time."

Hannah exhaled slowly, a sigh that carried both relief and patience. "Alright, having a direction is a good start. As long as we can prove beyond doubt that Erica masterminded these illegal factories, framed Alice,and profited through the illegal operations, justice will prevail."

"Justice will prevail," Vincent echoed, but the firmness in his voice could not hide a flicker of unease.Something gnawed at him. The path ahead might not go as smoothly. After all, Erica was cornered now. A cornered beast might strike with fangs bared. She might choose desperation over defeat.

Turning to Hannah, he spoke with stern finality."Starting tomorrow, your protection will be doubled.From now on, you will not step outside with fewer than five bodyguards."

Hannah's brows drew together in protest. "Five? Isn't that excessive? I hardly go anywhere but the office and home: Do I truly need that many?"

"Trust me," Vincent urged, his gaze unwavering, heavy with concern. "Erica is reckless and could pose a threat. We can't gamble with this. Only when she is captured will I breathe easy."

The deep worry in his eyes left Hannah speechless for a moment. At last, she gave a quiet nod, conceding to his will. "Alright, I'll listen to you."

A few days later, Bryant, who was keeping close watch over Erica's movements through the listening device, sent in fresh intelligence. Erica had made her next move.
###Chapter 534 Trap


Bryant came rushing in with news he had just intercepted, his tone urgent as he addressed Hannah, "Ms.Scott, Erica is planning to flee the country because she can't repay her massive debts! At exactly 2 p.m.,she'll be at Dock 3 in Dorbarrow, waiting for a private vessel!"

The words sent Hannah into a cold wave of panic. She couldn't let Erica escape. If she disappeared across the border, equipped with a fresh identity and safely transferred assets, every shred of evidence they had tied her to commercial sabotage and illegal operations would collapse in court. Justice would vanish with her.

Hannah's first instinct was to call the police. She did. Yet, the moment unfolded exactly as she feared-the surveillance recording was too vague, too poorly sourced to justify an official intervention. Legally, Erica could spin the whole situation as a routine trip for business or even a vacation.

Hannah pressed the options in her mind, weighing consequences, searching for any alternative. Her conclusion was stark. If Erica was to be stopped, she had to be the one to do it.

Hannah composed a quick message to Vincent, who was on a business trip, explaining the situation before gearing up for action.

For protection, she gathered the five bodyguards Vincent had placed under her care. Together,they left swiftly for the port at Dorbarrow.

Meanwhile, inside her room at the Jones family estate, Erica was performing with chilling precision. She had discovered the listening device hidden in the painting frame-the one planted by Hannah-and now staged a flawless act for Hannah. She had played the part of someone desperate and preparing to flee in panic.

Erica calculated the timing carefully, confident that Hannah would have heard the message and would take action.

With a cold smile, Erica switched off the listening device, cutting off the transmission From another encrypted phone, she dialed Scorpio. "Scorpio, get your men. Move to Dock 3 in Dorbarrow and prepare to take Hannah Scott alive."

Scorpio's voice carried hesitation. "You're certain she'll show? Is the intel solid? I don't want to drag my crew on a useless chase."

Erica snapped with an edge of fury, "Brixton didn't send you to question my command. You're here to follow orders.Do what I said."

For a brief moment, Scorpio paused, his voice tinged with practical worry. "I don't wvant my team to go through all this effort just to end up empty-handed, wasting precious time."

Erica's lips curled into a confident grin as she toyed with the tiny listening device between her fingers, her demeanor radiating certainty. "Don't worry. It won't be a pointless trip. This time, I'm pretty sure we'll make it. Stay out of sight and wait for my cue then."


***

At Dorbarrow's Dock 3, the air was thick with the briny tang of the ocean breeze.

Erica arrived well ahead of schedule, clutching a compact suitcase and feigning nervous anticipation for a vessel, though her sharp gaze repeatedly darted toward the dock's entrance.

Soon,a convoy of sleek black vehicles roared into view, screeching to a halt nearby.

Hannah emerged, flanked by five highly skilled security operatives. The group swiftly fanned out, encircling Erica, who appeared alone and vulnerable.

Hidden in the darkness, Scorpio and his crew froze in shock at the sight of Hannah.

How could this woman bear such an uncanny resemblance to Erica?

Erica, putting on a display of outrage and disbelief, confronted Hannah. "Hannah, what's the meaning of this? Why are you boxing me in with all these people?"

Hannah's stare was cold and unyielding,her voice resolute."Isn't it clear? You're not slipping away today,Erica." A flicker of genuine surprise crossed Erica's face, her eyes narrowing subtly. "When did you figure it out?"She was alluding to her true identity as Erica.

Hannah's lps twisted into a scornful smirk. "We've known since you tried to strike a deal with my staff after plagiarizing my company's game."

Erica hadn't anticipated that Hannah's suspicions went back that far."SO1it started that early... You've been playing me all along, making me look like a fool?"

"Making you look like a fool?" Hannah's gaze was piercing."We were gathering evidence by the book to send you, the mastermind behind all those schemes and shady operations, to prison!"

"Prison?" Erica let out a mocking laugh, her expression morphing into one of eerie triumph. "Hannah, do you honestly believe I'd let you have that opportunity? The one trapped here today is you!"

Abruptly, she raised her voice, calling out to the seemingly deserted dock, "What are you waiting for? Show yourselves!"

Before her words could fully fade, the muffled cracks of silenced gunfire pierced the air.

In a heartbeat, before they could respond, the five expertly trained guards Hannah had brought collapsed,their blood pooling across the dock's surface.

The attack was sudden and ruthless.

Hannah's stomach dropped. She realized too late that she'd walked intoa meticulously crafted trap. The so-called "escape" was nothing but a lure to draw her here.

Desperate, she spun toward the nearest car, hoping to flee.

But a figure emerged from the shadows, striking her neck with a brutal blow.

A wave of pain and vertigo overwhelmed Hannah. Her vision darkened, and she crumpled to the ground,unconscious.
###Chapter 535 Demanded A Ransom


Hannah stirred with effort, uncertain how long she had been out, only to realize she was in an unfamiliar place. Her wrists were bound behind her, a black cloth covered her eyes, and a gag pressed against her mouth.

She steadied her thoughts, straining to interpret the noises nearby.

Erica's tone, dripping with eager praise and desperate to impress, echoed close by, filled with excitement.
"Mr. Ward, see! This is Hannah, the woman Vincent treasures most! I delivered her to you."

Brixton's voice came evenly, laced with faint amusement. "Oh? So..." He halted, his gaze flicking between Hannah and Erica. "You went to such extremes merely to impersonate her and approach Vincent?"

His words hit a sore spot, and her voice turned awkward and flustered."Yes."

Brixton scoffed. "Idiot. You endured all that torment to alter your face, yet still failed to capture a single man? How pathetic."

Erica attempted to defend herself. "Mr. Ward, Vincent is too shrewd and guarded..."

"Enough!" Brixton snapped sharply, cutting her off. "I have no patience for excuses. I only care about results. Now that you've brought her here, do you need me to teach you what to do next?"

Erica answered with deference, "Understood! I'll send a message to Vincent right away, demanding a ransom!"

She understood perfectly that Brixton's identity had to remain in the shadows, while she took the forefront for extortion.

Brixton, content, gave a slight nod and lazily waved her away with faint irritation, signaling she should leave.

However, Erica lingered and then hesitantly said,"Mr.Ward..."

Brixton's voice turned icy."What now?" The atmosphere thickened, pressing heavily on the room.

Summoning her nerve, Erica carefully ventured, "Regarding the remaining factories, may I continue overseeing them? I swear this time, I'll..."

Before she could finish, Brixton advanced a few steps, drawing a small knife and pressing it against her neck. "Are you questioning my authority?"

Erica's tone quivered with fright. "I wouldn't dare, Mr. Ward! I only want to make up for my errors and help you run the operation well."

Brixton snorted, withdrawing the blade. "Focus on handling this ransom first. Then we'll revisit this talk,understood?"

"Understood!" Erica replied like someone spared from doom, retreating in haste.

Afterwad, Scorpio came forward with an inquiry, pointing at Hannah. "Mr. Ward, what shall we do with this woman?"

Brixton's voice turned lax again, carrying its lazy cadence. "Keep her apart from other captives of ours and place a pair of sharp guards over her. Ensure she remains unharmed before her man pays up, but don't let her grow too comfortable."

"Yes!" Scorpio answered.

Hannah assessed her perilous predicament. It seemed this"Mr. Ward" was the real power behind the scenes, while Erica was merely a disposable underling. Their reason for abducting her was obvious. They aimed to squeeze ransom from Vincent. Yet, was it truly only about money?

Feigning unconsciousness, Hannah offered no resistance as two figures heaved her up roughly. They dragged her away before flinging her into another place.

Once the heavy iron door shut and locked, silence wrapped around her.

Realizing she was briefly safe, Hannah strained to sit upright. She found herself tied again to a cold pillar,though this time, her arms weren't bound behind her. The rope was harshly fastened, yet her wrists could shift just enough for her fingers to brush against the blindfold's edge.

With grueling effort, Hannah scraped away the cloth and swiftly scanned the area. Only one exit existed-the door.

She attempted to pull free, but the knotting was skillfully done, making brute force worthless.

Compelling herself to remain composed, Hannah scoured every corner for some object she might use. But there was nothing.

Her eyes returned to the cord restraining her hands. She observed that though it was firm, it seemed tied with a slipknot. Maybe the abductors, thinking she was unconscious, grew careless and didn't bother with a dead knot.

Hope flared inside her. She bent forward, sinking her teeth into the rope's end, chewing and tugging with painstaking patience.

The ordeal was agonizing, her jaw aching from the coarse fiber, but she persevered.

She had no idea how long it took, but at last, she felt the knot give way.

Yet,she didn't instantly free herself. She realized the key was forcing the captors to open the door from the outside.

Collecting her breath, Hannah yelled, "Hey, I need the restroom. I really have to go. Open up the door!"

Irritated voices barked from beyond. "Shut it! Stay quiet!"

Hannah raised her volume. "I'm serious. I need to go. Open it now!"

The guards, fed up with the racket, muttered curses under their breath.

Moments later, Hannah caught the jingle of keys sliding into the lock.
###Chapter 536 A Failed Attempt To Break Free


The iron gate clanged open, and a man with a fierce scowl stormed in, muttering curses under his breath,"Damn it all, what a nuisance! Move it, now."

An icy glint flickered across Hannah's eyes. The moment had come.

Just as the man drew near, reaching out to seize her, Hannah tore free from the ropes. With sudden force,she struck-a sharp sweep aimed at his lower body, swift and merciless.

The man never expected resistance from the woman he had bound. His cry echoed as his legs buckled, and he crashed heavily to the floor.

Hearing the commotion, another man standing guard rushed in from outside.

Hannah spun, driving her elbow hard into him, and then swept his legs out in one fluid motion. With a grunt,he too collapsed at her feet.

Without wasting a heartbeat, Hannah darted from the cell.

Yet, the moment she stepped outside, her heart sank. This was no ordinary place-it was a sprawling,labyrinthine fortress. Narrow stone passages wound like tangled threads, linking countless identical low buildings, and in the distance loomed a watchtower.

Trusting only her instincts, Hannah picked a direction and ran with all her might.

But her dash for freedom quickly stirred the hornet's nest. Whistles split the air, sharp and piercing, as more guards in black poured from every corner, closing in on her.

She tried to weave through the passages, but her unfamiliarity betrayed her, and she soon found herself at a dead end.

Behind her, footsteps echoed-slow, deliberate, almost mocking.

Pressing against the cold stone wall, Hannah gasped for breath as Brixton appeared from the passage's mouth, his entourage shadowing him like wolves at dusk.

Brixton's gaze fell on Hannah, defiant and fierce, surprise flickering across his features. "You actually broke out on your own? I misjudged you." He smirked, his eyes gleaming as though sizing up a rare prize.′′NO wonder-Vincent's woman is far more interesting than I thought."


******

When Hannah's brief message reached him, Vincent had been out of town, attending a crucial signing ceremony in another city. She spoke of Erica's possible escape-and her own plan to intercept.

Every word in that message unsettled him. Without hesitation, he abandoned all arrangements and headed straight for the airport, seizing a private flight to return to Dorbarrow as fast as the skies would allow.

The instant the plane touched down, he refused to wait for the steps to be lowered. Striding down impatiently, he leapt into the waiting car.

"To Dock 3-hurry!" Vincent barked, his voice taut with urgency and edged with raw concerns.

All the way there, he kept calling Hannah, but the line never connected. He tried the bodyguards he had assigned to protect her, but every call ended in silence.

A shadow of foreboding loomed larger with every passing minute.

"Faster!" he pressed the driver, watching the scenery blur past the window, though no speed could ease the storm in his chest.

At last, the car screeched to a halt outside Dock 3-and Vincent's heart sank like a stone.

Police lights blazed red and blue, casting harsh shadows. Yellow tape cordoned off wide stretches of the dock, the entire place tense and heavy with tragedy.

"What happened here?" Vincent staggered from the car, nearly stumbling as he grabbed a nearby officer.His voice cracked with dread.

Before the officer could answer, Derek came running. His face was pale, his voice grim and rushed. "Mr.Jones, it's bad-terribly bad! There was a shooting at the port. The bodies we found... All of them are our men. The five bodyguards assigned to protect Ms. Scott are dead."

The words struck Vincent like a bolt from a clear sky. His vision blurred, his body wavered, and only Derek's quick grip kept him upright.

A single thought pounded in Vincent's mind-all the bodyguards were gone, but what about Hannah? She must have been with the bodyguards at the time.
###Chapter 537 Shall We Meet


A chilling notion seized Vincent, wrapping around his chest like an iron chain and nearly choking the breath out of him.

Vincent shoved Derek aside, straining to surge past the police barricade, yet several officers held him back with unyielding force. "Sir, this is a crime scene! You can't cross!"

Vincent's eyes blazed with desperation, his breath coming in frantic bursts. Gripping one officer's arm with trembling hands, he pleaded, his voice quaking, "Officer, among the dead... Tell me, is there... Is there a woman? A woman named Hannah? Is she there?"

The officer, shaken by the raw heartbreak in Vincent's tone, hesitated before giving a grave nod. "There is a female victim. The scene... It is quite tragic."

Darkness clouded Vincent's sight; his knees almost gave way, but Derek caught him in time.

The officer, with practiced calm, gestured toward the row of white-shrouded forms nearby. "The bodies are there. If you need to identify someone, please go there to confirm."

Breaking free from Derek's support, Vincent staggered toward the place pointed out.

Summoning what little strength he had left, he lifted the sheet covering a woman's form-his hands shaking like leaves in the wind. A stranger's unfamiliar face stared back at him. It wasn't her.

A single tear slipped from the corner of Vincent's eye. His chest heaved, a sheen of cold sweat covering him. Thank heaven-it wasn't her.

But relief was quickly eclipsed by an even sharper terror. If Hannah wasn't among the dead, then where was she? All five bodyguards lay slain. What had she endured?

Forcing himself to think, Vincent pulled out his phnone, opening the tracking program linked to Hannah's security wristband. But her signal had vanished into a void, smothered as though by some powerful interference. Just as panic threatened to overtake him, his phone chimed with a new message. The sender was Erica."Shall we meet,Vincent?"

Attached was a location.

Vincent recognized the address immediately. It was the abandoned factory where Erica had once staged her own death, setting fire to her escape.

His eyes narrowed like blades. Erica had set a trap to ensnare Hannah. But the real prey was him.

Vincent turned sharply to Derek. "Gather everyone at our disposal. Follow me!"

"Yes,Mr.Jones!"

***

Inside the deserted factory, Erica glanced at her watch, a sly smile tugging at her lips as Vincent arrived."Faster than I expected, Vincent."

Vincent stormed in with Derek and several guards, his voice thunderous. "Where's Hannah? What have you done to her?"

Erica laughed, savoring his frantic edge. "Why get so worked up, Vincent? I'm still your aunt in name, aren't I? Shouldn't we catch up first?"

"Catching up?" His eyes burned with fire. Striding forward, he seized Erica by the throat, slamming her against the cold wall. His voice was low and lethal. "I'll ask you once more-where is Hannah?"

Erica gasped for air, her face reddening, yet her eyes glittered with defiance. Through strained breaths,she forced words out. "Go ahead. Strangle me. Kill me if you dare. But if I die, you'll never find her. She'll never...return to your side.."

Her words struck like icy water, dousing the blaze of his fury. His grip slackened, and she collapsed into a fit of violent coughing.

When she finally steadied herself, she leaned against the wall and erupted into a bitter laugh-shrill,haunting, and hollow. "Ha-ha, Vincent! So it's true-you care for her to the very marrow of your bones!" The laughter cut off, and venom replaced it. Her eyes burned with jealousy and bitterness as she gestured to her face. "But look at me! I became her reflection, wearing a face almost identical to hers. Why can't you see me for once? Do you have any idea what I sacrificed to wear this face? Do you know how I suffered through that endless year-my face hidden in bandages, sleepless nights gnawed by fear and pain, unable even to face a mirror?"

Pausing, she added, "I endured it all, believing that once healed, this face would mean you might treat me better. But no! You remain colder than stone,despising me still!"

Her words cracked into a desperate wail. "I love you... I've loved you for more than ten years, and yet you and Hannah intend to cast me into prison? Tell me, what sin have I committed? What crime deserves this cruelty?"
###Chapter 538 Did You Ever Shed A Single Tear For Me


Vincent fixed his eyes on Erica, yet his expression carried not a trace of feeling. "You've committed murder and engaged in unlawful dealings. Whether compelled by conscience or guided by the sake of social stability, I have to uphold justice and send you to jail."

"Uphold justice? Ha-ha! What a noble act!" Erica sneered through strained laughter, tears of outrage shimmering in her gaze. "After alI these years of affection, all these seasons of loyalty and patience, the only reward I get is your icy declaration of upholding justice? Vincent, you are something else. You are merciless!"

Vincent's restraint reached its limit. He reiterated his single demand, his tone heavy with insistence."Let′S put the past behind us. Where is Hannah?"

The finalfragment of hope inside Erica's chest splintered apart. She lifted her palm and harshly brushed away the moisture from her face.

A frigid curve tugged at her lips, her cadence shifting into a clipped, transactional rhythm. "Produce one billion in currency. Old notes, without tracking. Also, a chartered jet stocked with fuel, stationed at the deserted terminal on the western edge of the city. Bring no guards; you must appear alone."

She withdrew her phone and hastily typed a message. "Exact coordinates and timing-await further word.If you obey, you'll see your beloved one soon."

Vincent's device instantly buzzed with a location alert. He opened it, his forehead creasing severely-the marker pinpointed a distant nation overseas. How had they succeeded in transferring Hannah abroad in so little time? The influence and efficiency backing this group exceeded every measure of his predictions.

"I need assurance of Hannah's well-being first," Vincent asserted with firm bargaining weight. "A billion is far from trivial. I have the right to confirm she's safe now. You must provide certainty, or I won't simply hand over the money."

Erica's pupils flickered faintly, not refusing outright. "I'll need to evaluate that request." She produced another device and began tapping, clearly requesting approval from those orchestrating events behind her.

Vincent observed her movements intently, growing more convinced that she was not the one in charge.

After a while, Erica lifted her head and offered a middle ground, saying, "Here's the deal: when you bring the money to the final location I provide, you'll be shown a recording of Hannah proving she remains alive."

Vincent realized pressing harder would yield no results and could even provoke risk, placing Hannah in jeopardy. He finally declared with a grave timbre, "I'll prepare immediately. But if I don't see her or if she's harmed in any way, Erica, you comprehend the consequences."

He pivoted to depart without granting her another look.

"Vincent!" Erica suddenly cried after him.′′One last question... When you believed I perished in the blaze,did you ever shed a single tear for me?"

Vincent's stride never faltered, nor did he glance back."No."

Erica stood rooted, her lips twisting into a smile more painful than tears. Her decade-long humble infatuation ended in such a complete failure, leaving her completely undone.

Rather than return to the Jones family manor, she drifted to her secluded apartment, drowning in despair.

For the first occasion, she hadn't come to torment Logan, who remained confined in the guest room.Instead, she walked into his room, threw herself into his embrace as he sat by the window, sunk in reflection, and clutched him with desperation, sobbing uncontrollably. "Logan, you're all that's left for me now...I truly only have you..."

Logan froze, his frame rigid, a glimmer of conflicted dread flashing across his stare. He wavered briefly before finally lifting his hand, awkwardly patting her shoulder without speaking.


***

Meanwhile, within the stronghold of Brixton, since Hannah's failed escape and subsequent recapture, her treatment appeared to have undergone subtle changes. She was no longer restrained or confined to the windowless chamber but permitted to remain within the primary residence where Brixton stayed. Though still under restriction, she possessed slightly broader freedom.

Brixton had even ordered that she be kept in his presence, supervised personally by him.

Hannah hadn't given up. She attempted escape on several more occasions, yet every effort, no matter how carefully devised, was swiftly foiled by Brixton's men.

This time, she was once again brought before Brixton.

Brixton did not display fury but instead a mocking delight. Reclining indolently on the vast sofa, he idly spun a blade, a taunting grin curling his mouth. "Do you understand why I no longer shackle you? Because I'm certain you cannot slip beyond my hold. This island is your cage. You can only remain obediently at my side,so abandon those wasted struggles."
###Chapter 539 Pervert


Hannah drew in ragged breaths, yet her voice carried unyielding steel. "As long as I live, as long as I draw breath, I'll never stop seeking a way out!"

"Hah, quite the backbone you've got." Brixton's tone carried amusement. He rose, crossed the space, and with the cold kiss of his dagger's tip, tilted her chin upward. "Alright then, let's make this a game with rules.From now on, every time you attempt an escape, I'll carve a mark on that pretty arm of yours. Fair trade,don't you think?"

He paused, as though lost in recollection. "Let me think... You've tried three times already. That means three cuts you owe me."

Before the echo of his words faded, his wrist flicked, and the blade danced. In the blink of an eye, three swift slashes seared across Hannah's left arm.

The motion was too quick for her to resist. Agonizing pain struck, and crimson welled immediately.

Hannah bit hard on her lower lip and swallowed her cries, refusing to give him the satisfaction of a scream.

Leaning closer, Brixton drew the blade to his tongue, tasting the blood with eyes grown darker still. A low chuckle slipped from him. "Tsk... Sweet as honey."

"Pervert!" Hannah hurled the word like a dagger of her own, teeth clenched.

Yet, Brixton wore the insult as though it were a crown, his grin widening with delight. "I like that."

He gestured lazily to the man at his side. "Take her away. Patch her up. Don't let her bleed to death."

Hannah was led to a chamber on the second floor of the main building, just a wall apart from Brixton's own quarters. Compared to the suffocating cell before, this room was a world apart-there was even a window that opened toward the restless sea.

Her arm received a crude rinse and a gauze wrap. It wasn't the touch of a healer, but it stopped the bleeding.

Standing by the window, Hannah's thoughts sharpened like glass. Running around aimlessly, apart from angering that perverted Brixton and getting herself hurt repeatedly, was utterly meaningless and a waste of time. Brixton was the undisputed master of this island and the organization that thrived here. Her security wristband's signal was completely blocked. Even if Vincent had the skill enough to move mountains,locating her swiftly would be nearly impossible. No-she had only herself to rely on.

To truly walk free, brute force alone would not open her cage. She needed another path. She had to earn Brixton's trust-at least, a shadow of it.

That very day, while her gaze wandered over the horizon of waves, the door suddenly flung open without the slightest knock.

Brixton strode in, his mood lifted, eyes roaming over her with a mischievous gleam. His lips curled. "Not plotting your escape today? Changed your tune?"

Hannah turned, her face carved into stillness, her tone flat as a board. "I'm afraid of pain."

"Afraid of pain?" Brixton chuckled, amused by her reply.

In an instant, his hand seized her injured arm, fingers pressing deliberately against the tender wound beneath the gauze.

A sharp wave of pain shot through her, draining the color from her face. She gasped but held the sound in her throat, cursing silently, "You wretched fiend!"

Brixton's eyes gleamed as he watched her tremble yet endure without a single cry. His brow arched. "If you fear pain, then why stay silent when I cut you?"

Hannah resisted the urge to jerk free. She lifted her gaze, mockery lacing her voice. "I held back. If I screamed too loudly, it might sour your mood. And then you'd carve deeper, wouldn't you? That would be a greater loss for me-not worth the price."

For a heartbeat, Brixton looked taken aback. Then, as though the logic tickled him, he let out a booming laugh,releasing her arm. "Ha-ha! Clever woman! You increasingly amuse me by the day!"
His laughter still hanging in the air, he suddenly nodded to his subordinate at the door. "Bring me my phone."

Hannah's heart clenched. Wariness shadowed her eyes as she watched,uncertain of his intent.

The subordinate returned quickly, placing an encrypted phone into Brixton's hands.

Brixton unlocked the phone, lifted it, and to her shock, began recording a video of her.

Stunned, Hannah instinctively stepped back. "What are you doing?"

A sly smile curved Brixton's lips as he looked at her, mood buoyant. "Relax. I'm in a good mood today. Your Mr. Jones is moving quicker than I expected. Seems your time here will end sooner than you think."
###Chapter 540 Noted She Was Injured


Hannah's heart skipped a beat. Vincent? Had he already made contact with these people? She clenched her fists, steadying herself, and with a show of casual indifference, she asked, "What do you want Vincent to do?"

Brixton studied Hannah, as if he had stumbled upon a new source of amusement, and leaned in deliberately."Already flustered? Then he must weigh heavily on your heart."

Realizing her response had been too intense, Hannah drew back a few steps and turned her head,her voice calm. "I was only curious."

Brixton's smile carried knowing amusement, yet he didn't push further. He merely waved his phone at her."Don't try anything foolish. If you attempt escape again..." His eyes turned cold as steel."Next time, it won't be mere cuts."

With that, he turned and strode away, his mood oddly lightened.

Meanwhile, at a hidden airstrip along a lonely stretch of coast, Vincent stood by himself. Behind him lay a sealed box stuffed with a billion in cash, and nearby, a private jet waited with engines humming.

From the distance, a car rolled closer and stopped. Erica stepped out first, two hulking men dispatched by Brixton flanking her like shadows.

Erica walked toward Vincent and held out her phone, showing him a freshly sent video. "Look closely. She's alive, unharmed. Now, could you come with us without worry?"

Vincent's eyes locked onto the phone screen. In the clip, Hannah stood by a window with an unfamiliar sea behind her. Her face seemed pale, but what stabbed at him was the bandage wrapped tight around her left arm.

The air around Vincent chilled to ice. He seized Erica by the throat, his voice low and deadly. "What happened to Hannah's arm? Who did this to her? I said no harm must come to her!" Erica's breath hitched, her face flushing crimson as she clawed at his grip. "How would I know? I never gave that order! Why vent your rage on me?"

At once, the two men shifted, hands drifting to their waists, tension hanging like a blade in the air.

But Erica raised a hand quickly to halt them, forcing a bitter smile. "Stand down. He wouldn't dare harm me.After all, he needs me to find his beoved woman."

Vincent's eyes blazed with fury, but at last, he let go.

Erica stumbled back, coughing hard, gathering her breath again. Her glare was edged with ice. "Board the plane. Don't you want to see Hannah sooner?"

Vincent's gaze sharpened. "She isn't here?"

"Heh." A sneer curled Erica's lips. "You thought we'd let you waltz into our base? Faced with a man like you,caution is life itself. This is only a transit stop. We'll use your jet to reach where she's truly kept. Better safe than sorry-we can't afford to hand you our hideout on a silver platter."

Swallowing his rising anxiety, Vincent said nothing more and boarded first.

Erica and the two men followed close behind.

Once in the air, Vincent realized the journey was more twisted than he had imagined.

The plane never flew straight; instead, it hopped from one temporary strip to another, pausing, sometimes even swapping out crew before lifting off again.

This dance went on for two full days, time wasted in endless circles.

"Are you toying with me?" Vincent's patience frayed thin.

Across from him, Erica sipped her water with deliberate leisure. "Toying with you? There's a billion in cash by your side. Why would we? Be patient-we're almost there. In our line of work, caution is a must."

Her tone was calm, but deep within, unease gnawed. It had been far too long since Brixton's last contact,and silence often boded ill. On the third day, the plane at last ceased its restless landings and flew steadily toward a fixed coordinate.

As descent began, Erica exhaled a secret sigh of relief, pulling out an encrypted phone to reach those on the island. But just then, the device vibrated sharply in her palm. A message appeared, draining the color from her face. "Base compromised! Situation unclear! Do not return to the island!"

"What happened?" Vincent's keen eyes caught her panic instantly, his voice dropping heavy

Erica's lips trembled. "For now, we can't go there!"

Vincent's heart plunged. "Explain!"

###Chapter 541 Was Looking For You


Erica's voice cracked with terror. "Enemies infiltrated our base, chaos erupted, and we've lost all contact with the boss!"

Vincent shot upright, gripping her shoulders tightly. "What about Hannah? Tell me where she is!"

"I... I have no idea! The message gave no details!"Erica was consumed by panic, her thoughts a storm of confusion. "But since the message didn't confirm her state, she must still be alive,right? You can only hold out until more word arrives."

"Hold out?" Vincent's eyes burned red. "I refuse to hold out! Tell me her location this instant!"

"I truly don't knowv! I don't have the faintest clue about the situation there. There's nothing I can do!" Erica cried,her composure collapsing completely.

Witnessing her in such frantic disarray, Vincent considered the grim chance that Hannah was in severe peril.The final restraint in his reasoning tore apart. Acting without delay, he delivered a decisive blow to the back of Erica's neck, knocking her out cold.

The two bulking men nearby reacted instantly, reaching for weapons, yet Vincent moved first. With several rapid strikes, both men collapsed to the floor, unconscious.

With all obstacles cleared, Vincent sprinted toward the cockpit. He overpowered the pilot with ease and took control, skillfully operating the instrument panel. His fascination with aviation had once earned him a pilot's license, though he had rarely flown in person. Now, that skill came in handy.

Vincent redirected the aircraft, accelerating straight toward Dorbarrow. He refused to wait for uncertain news. He needed to return at once, to force from Erica the precise location where Hannah might be confined, whatever it required. He would bring Hannah back.


******

Gunfire thundered throughout Brixton's fortress. With the majority of Brixton's fighters reassigned and being undermined by an undercover from the enemy gang Black Dragons, Brixton's handful of faithful men were quickly overwhelmed by the gang's ruthless charge.

Brixton took a bullet to the stomach, yet his expression revealed neither agony nor dread; instead, he appeared almostecstatic in the chaos of blood and smoke.

Hannah crouched behind cover, heart racing. This was her one chance to slip away. Seizing the moment,she darted toward a narrow side passage.

But a man from the Black Dragons, eyes filled with menace, lunged with a wicked grin, seizing her arm."Running off, darling? Stay here and amuse me!"

Hannah countered swiftly, using her judo training to resist and strike back.

Yet, the man's bulk and strength dwarfed hers, dragging her close, his foul breath flooding her senses."1enjoy a woman who fights!"

Bang! A sharp shot cracked past her ear. The man stiffened, a crimson hole splitting his forehead as he toppled backward.

Stunned, Hannah turned and saw Brixton standing behind her, weapon smoking, muzzle lowered. His gaze blazed coldly, amusement flickering. "And where exactly were you planning to go?"

Hannah's mind raced. Forcing calm, she met his stare. "I was searching for you! Are you wounded?"

Brixton let out a dark laugh, unimpressed. "Searching for me?"

As he spoke, he casually fired behind him, taking down an enemy attempting to ambush him from the side.His marksmanship was terrifyingly precise.

"Yes!" Hannah insisted. "The turmoil here is unbearable! I'm safest by your side!"

"Oh?" Brixton arched a brow, seemingly entertained by her claim. "You're right."

Without warning, he yanked her behind him, firing twice that struck down two more attackers.
"Stay close!" he commanded, pulling her toward a weak breach in the enemy's assault, his movements swift and a ggressive, showing no signs of the bullet wound-as if the pain and blood loss only fueled his intensity.

Hannah stumbled along, barely able to keep up, her breathing ragged.

Suddenly, Brixton halted, drawing a metallic device from his pocket, his grin manic. "Do you know what this is?"

Hannah instinctively shook her head.

"A delightful toy," Brixton sneered wider.

He turned sharply, hurling it toward the largest cluster of enemies in pursuit.

Boom! The blast roared violently, fire erupting, waves of force ripping through the air, screams snuffed out instantly. Half a dozen men were annihilated in the explosion.

Hannah, crouched behind cover from the shockwave, turned pale as she realized it had been an explosive.
This man was deranged!

Brixton's tongue flicked across his lips with excitement, his fist pumping in savage triumph.

Yet, a moment later, cold steel pressed firmly to the back of his head.
###Chapter 542 You Know How To Shoot
A mocking voice drifted from behind. "Brixton, it's been a while.Still enjoy using explosives, are we?"

Brixton turned his head slowly. When he saw who it was,he didn't flinch. On the contrary, his smile deepened,dripping with disdain and arrogance.

Brixton straightened his back, as if the gun pointed at his forehead was no more than a toy. "Well, well... I wondered who it could be. Turns out it's my defeated foe. Dewitt,what is it? You didn't get enough of a beating last time and came back for more?"

The man aiming at Brixton was indeed his sworn enemy, Dewitt Marquez-one of the key players in this ambush.

A jagged scar cut across Dewitt's face,twisting cruelly as he sneered, "Even standing at death's door,you never shut that arrogant mouth. I've already crushed your base; your men are either corpses or scattered like frightened birds. Now, tell me -who's worse off? And with that bullet festering in your stomach, where exactly do you think you could run to?"

Hannah held her breath, quietly observing the situation. She quickly realized Dewitt had approached alone; his men must have been locked in the front-line assault or busy hunting down stragglers.

Not far from her lay a corpse, and by its side-an abandoned handgun. Her pulse quickened. This was her moment.

She dropped low, moving silently, and while Brixton and Dewitt squared off, she slipped forward and snatched the weapon,tucking it behind her back.
Dewitt was so busy gloating that he didn't notice Hannah's careful maneuver.

Hannah's palms sweated as she clutched the gun, her heart racing like a drumbeat. Forcing her breath steady,she.weighed the distance, the angle, the chance.

Then, she raised the weapon, aimed straight at Dewitt, and fired without a flicker of hesitation.

Bang! The shot cracked the air. Dewitt's body jolted,blood bursting from his shoulder like a cruel blossom.

Dewitt spun toward Hannah, shock and fury carved into his eyes. "You... You witch!"

Brixton blinked once in surprise and then erupted in wild laughter. "Ha-ha! Now this is a twist! Who would've guessed you knew how to shoot? Shame though-your aim strayed.Not a killing blow."

Brixton's laughter barely echoed before his face hardened.Without pause, he squeezed his own trigger.

Bang! Bang! Bang! A volley of gunfire rang out. Dewitt dropped,this time never to rise again.

"Move!" Brixton barked. He spared not a glance at Dewitt's corpse, yanked the stunned Hannah by the wrist, and dragged her along the escape route.

"Over there! They killed Dewitt!" A furious cry rose in the distance, followed by another storm of bullets.

Lead whistled through the air.

Brixton, quick as lightning, hurled two-then three-explosives over his shoulder.

Boom! Boom! Boom! The chain of blasts thundered,slowing their pursuers.

With Hannah in tow, Brixton kept running. His pace was ruthless,and Hannah-exhausted, lungs burning-stumbled again and again.

"You're lagging," Brixton taunted, though his own face had paled ghostly white from blood loss.

"I... I can't run anymore," Hannah panted, vision swimming."They're after you. Go on without me."

Brixton's grip crushed her wrist like iron. "Really? You want to stop here? Then stay-and see for yourself. Dewitt's men are wolves,far more vicious than I'll ever be. If they catch you,there's only one end-gang-raped to death. Is that what you want? To test your fate?"

His words struck her like a slap. Survival surged back into her veins. She clenched her teeth. "Then we run!"

With every ounce of strength, they tore through the fortress's rear gate and burst onto the shoreline.

Here was the dock where they usually boarded a boat.

"What now? Planning to swim?" Hannah asked,voice trembling as her gaze fell on the black water.

Brixton gave no instant reply. His eyes swept the sea, sharp as a hawk's, searching. Suddenly, his expression lit. "Don't you see?"

Their yacht was approaching.

Hannah followed his gaze but saw nothing on the waves.

Gunfire cracked again behind them, mingled with the shouts of enemies drawing closer.

"Damn it!" Brixton cursed. He glanced once at their pursuers-then something fierce and reckless flashed in his eyes.

Without warning, he shoved Hannah hard into the sea.
###Chapter 543 She'll Do It

The freezing seawater swallowed Hannah in a single gulp, the salty brine rushing into her mouth and nose until she was choking and gasping like a fish thrown on land.

Somewhere through the roar in her ears, she faintly caught Brixton's voice. "We can only swim now."

Inwardly,she cursed him as nothing short of a lunatic.

Her survival instinct flared, urging her arms to thrash desperately, but her strength was draining away as fast as sand through an hourglass.

Just then, a medium-sized yacht surged toward them, cutting through the waves.

Brixton was hauled aboard first by his men. He was panting hard,his abdominal wound looking even more ghastly, blood seeping out with relentless persistence.

Wiping the seawater from his face, Brxton scanned the surface and quickly realized Hannah hadn't been pulled up.

Scorpio instantly volunteered. "Mr. Ward, I'll get her!"

But Brixton's brow creased, his mutter sharper than the wind."What a pain!"

Before the last syllable left his lips, he was already in motion -quicker than Scorpio's reflexes-diving back into the sea,slicing through the waves toward Hannah.

Brixton reached the semi-conscious Hannah in moments,slipped an arm around her waist, and dragged her toward the yacht.

With the crew lending their strength, both were finally hauled
With the crew lending their strength, both were finally hauled onto the deck.

Hannah collapsed onto the wet planks, coughing up mouthfuls of seawater,her entire figure a portrait of ruin.

Beside her, Brixton stood heaving for breath as well, yet his face carried a disturbing excitement. He leaned down,a crooked smile tugging at his lips. "How was that? Exhilarating,wasn't it?"

Hannah lacked even the strength to glare. She simply shut her eyes, struggling for breath. This was the kind of thrill one would rather die without.

Meanwhile, Scorpio finished a quick headcount and reported,"Mr. Ward, most of our men are out, but a handful are still stuck inside. Dewitt's forces are clearing the fortress. Should we seize this chance to strike back and catch them off guard?"

Brixton waved him off, a sty smile playing across his face. "No need. If my calculations are right, the clock's just about there."

He began a countdown. "Three... Two... One..."

On the last number, he shaped his lips into a playful bang!

At that exact heartbeat, a deafening explosion split the air from the direction of the island fortress. Even across the distance,fire and smoke clawed their way to the sky.

It was plain that Brixton had hidden enough explosives in the fortress's core to reduce it to ash, leaving his enemies nothing but rubble.

The crew stood dumbfounded and then broke into fervent admiration."Mr. Ward, you're a genius!"

The blast startled Hannah. She opened her eyes to the inferno in the distance, her heart clenching in horror. Brixton was truly deranged.
)

Brixton, satisfied with his fiery masterpiece, turned his gaze on Hannah. "Sorry, looks like you won't be seeing your Vincent anytime soon."

Hannah looked away, refusing to waste words. She had foreseen such an end; ever since falling into Brixton's hands,she'd abandoned any illusion of an easy escape.

Her resignation seemed to amuse him. He crouched, hooked a finger under her chin, and forced her to meet his gaze. "By the way, that shooting of yours earlier didn't look like a beginner's.Who trained you?"

Hannah jerked her head aside, dodging his touch. Her voice came cool and flat. "No one. Just figured it out after watching you shoot a few times."

The lie slipped out easily, little more than an attempt to brush him off.

But Brixton's curiosity only sharpened, his chuckle low and drawn-out. "You learned just by watching? Hah... You grow more fascinating by the moment. I'm beginning to see why Vincent's spellbound."

Hannah sealed her lips, retreating into silence.

Brixton's eyes dropped to the blood soaking his abdomen.Then,almost casually, he asked, "Ever taken out a bullet?"

Hannah eyed himwarily."Of course not!"

"Perfect." His smile widened like a boy handed a new toy."Because you're going to dig this one out of me."

Hannah's eyes flew wide. "You've lost your mind! Isn't there a doctor on board?"

"Doctor?" Brixton scoffed, casting a glance around the yacht,which was clearly built only for escape. "Do you really think this vessel carries one?"
Her voice turned icy. "Aren't you worried I might drive the blade in deeper and finish you off?"

Brixton met her gaze, arrogance gleaming in his eyes. "Then do it. If I die at your hand, it only proves I lacked the skill to survive-l'd accept that fate."

Scorpio went pale, alarm etched on his face. He rushed forward."Mr. Ward, this is madness! Let me do it! She's an outsider. She can't be trusted!"

But Brixton didn't waver, his eyes locked on Hannah. "No.She'll do it."
###Chapter 544 You Were Testing Her
Hannah and Brixton stepped into a cabin within the yacht.

Brixton rested on the mattress, his torso uncovered, a gunshot injury on his abdomen gaping outward, flesh torn with blood steadily leaking.

Scorpio arranged a crude collection of surgical instruments across the nearby table. He retreated to the doorway, wordless and alert, prepared to step in if Hannah attempted to harm Brixton.

Hannah stared at the selection of tools, her fingers trembling violently as she reached for the forceps. She tried aiming at the wound, but her grip faltered uncontrollably.

With a loud clink, she hurled the forceps back onto the tray,her voice breaking. "I can't. I've never performed something like this!"

Brixton observed her distress and let out a faint laugh. The chuckle pulled at his injury, forcing him to grimace. "You had the nerve to fire at people, yet you falter at pulling a bullet out of skin? Hannah, how does your bravery crumble so easily?"

"This isn't the same!" Hannah answered in haste,her voice quivering. "Squeezing the trigger lasts a second, but this... This demands..."

"What difference is there?" Brixton cut her short."|t′SCstill bullets involved. Quit stalling and get on with it. I'm losing blood fast."

"And if I decline?" Hannah clenched her jaw, pushing back one last time.

Brixton's gaze turned icy at once, his words calm but edged."Then step outside, leap into the sea, and serve as food for fish. Scorpio will gladly help you overboard."

Hannah's chest tightened. She realized this lunatic meant every word. At last, she yielded, her eyes shutting briefly. With a dry tone, she asked, "What about anesthetic? At least give me some anesthetic?"

Before Scorpio could respond, Brixton cut him off sharply. "We don't have any. None at all. Stop stalling and get on with it."

Hannah felt her spirit sink. Shaking, she seized a bottle of alcohol and poured it liberally across Brixton's stomach injury to sterilize it.

Brixton's frame stiffened, a muted groan forced through his lips, yet he clamped his jaw, refusing to cry out.

Hannah's trembling worsened. She forced her focus away from Brixton, lifted the forceps, inhaled deeply, and slid them into the bloodied gash, searching for the bullet.

The sensation of metal navigating torn flesh made her scalp prickle and her stomach twist.

The seconds dragged unbearably.

Finally, the tip struck something solid.

Her chest tightened as she latched onto the bullet and began dragging it outward with care.

A few seconds later, the bullet emerged.

Hannah felt drained, staggering back before rushing out of the cabin to vomit violently over the railing.

Inside the cabin, Brixton nearly collapsed on the bedding,soaked in cold perspiration.

Scorpio moved near at once, lowering his tone with confusion."Mr.Ward, we did have anesthetic. Why refuse..."

Brixton lifted a weak hand, stopping him. "What thrill lies in that? The only real test is seeing her true nature at·a critical moment like this."

Forcing Hannah to extract the bullet wasn't Brixton's real purpose; it wvas to confirm if she was the infiltrator. In that vulnerable state, he couldn't afford unconsciousness due to the anesthetic.

Scorpio caught on, his stare sharpening. "Mr. Ward,you were testing her? You suspect she's..."

"Quiet..." Brixton warned, his eyes hardening. "Until the traitor is exposed, suspicion falls on everyone. Especially her-she appeared suddenly, the most suspicious."

Brixton paused, calculation flickering in his expression. "Later,find some excuse to leave. Let her stay as the one tending me.With my state this fragile, will she resist taking advantage?"

Scorpio nodded firmly. "Understood! Leave it with me,Mr.Ward! I'll handle it!"

Scorpio slipped back to the doorway.

Moments later, Hannah returned, her complexion pale, nausea still clawing at her.

Scorpio, stationed at the door, barked sternly, "You, inside! Mr.Ward is your responsibility now! Fail him, and I'll throw you into the sea!"

Hannah cast him a weary look, inwardly scoffing at their predictable threats. But with no energy to argue, she pushed the cabin door open and stepped in again.

Inside, Brixton drifted between faintness and pain, his eyes shut,breaths shallow. The wound bled on, unattended.

A dagger rested on the small surface beside him.
Hannah froze mid-step. After a silent moment of thought,she finally extended her hand and took the dagger from the table.
###Chapter 545 Physical Contact
Hannah crept closer to the bed, her gaze fixed on Brixton's seemingly defenseless figure. With each step, her grip on the knife tightened, as if she were holding both her courage and her fear in the same hand.

At last, she summoned her resolve and swung the blade, aiming not at flesh but at the hem of his cleaner shirt, intending to slice off a strip.

Almost at once, a hand shot out like lightning, clamping her wrist with such force that it seemed her bones might splinter.

Brixton-supposedly unconscious-snapped his eyes open,sharp and unyielding. "What do you think you're doing?"

The sudden movement jolted Hannah, pain flashing up her wrist like fire racing along a fuse.

She steadied herself, voice calm though her heart pounded."Your wound's still bleeding. I thought I'd tear some fabric from your shirt to use as a bandage."

She held up the strip she'd managed to cut, proof of her intent.

Brixton's eyes stayed guarded, suspicion lingering like a shadow."That's it?"

"What else would it be?" Hannah retorted, her tone crisp.

Yet, something gnawed at her. She replayed the scene in her mind-the knife left carelessly within reach, his overt suspicion -and then the truth struck like a bell.

Her lips curved into a mocking smile. "So this was a trap? You planted the knife there just to see if I'd try to finish you while
planted the knife there just to see if I'd try to finish you while you were down?"

Brixton didn't waste words denying it. He released her wrist,though his gaze lingered on her, tinged now with quiet amusement. "Quick mind. Not bad."

Hannah rubbed her reddened wrist, a bitter laugh escaping."If I wanted you dead, don't you think I'd have done it already?Back at the fortress, in the middle of that gunfight-I could've put a bullet in your back instead of helping you drop Dewitt.I saved your life!"

Brixton scoffed, brushing off her claim like dust. "Don't flatter yourself.I would've managed without you."

"But you can't deny I was the one who shot Dewitt, giving you the opening to finish him!" Hannah fired back, her glare sharp as daggers.

For a moment, Brixton stayed silent. And silence, in its way,was as close to admission as words could be.

Done with the argument, Hannah flung the knife to the floor with a metallic thud and started toward the door.

But at the threshold, she halted. Her eyes flicked back to the blood seeping steadily from Brixton's stomach. With a weary sigh, she turned back. "What, are you planning to just bleed out?" she mocked.

Brixton arched a brow at her return, sarcasm dripping from his voice. "And what remedy do you propose?"

Hannah bent down, retrieved the knife, and snapped,"Tear up your clothes and use them as bandages!"

Brixton frowned. "Why ruin my clothes when there's gauze right there?"

He tilted his head toward a half-open medical kit in the corner.
Hannah followed his gaze and spotted the neat roll of clean gauze. Her hands froze, fury flaring hot as she realized he had been playing with her all along.

With a sharp clatter, she drove the knife into the floorboards and hissed through clenched teeth, "You could've said that earlier!"

Brixton looked positively entertained. Lounging back against the pillow, he drawled in a way that made her want to strangle him,"You didn't ask."

Hannah inhaled deeply, reminding herself that losing her temper with this man was like pouring oil on a fire. Without another word, she snatched the gauze and began to bandage his wound in brisk silence.

Her movements were efficient, almost clinical, careful to avoid unnecessary touch.

But when she had to wrap the gauze around his back,she had no choice but to lean close.

Her breath skimmed the side of his neck, feather-light.

Brixton stiffened at once, as though unaccustomed to any woman drawing so near. Abruptly,he shoved Hannah away,his movements harsh and abrupt. "That's enough! I'll finish it myself."

Hannah stepped back without protest, grateful for the space between them. She crossed to the table, sank into a chair, and turned her back on him.

Relief washed over her, though it carried with it the weight of exhaustion and blood loss. She meant only toclose her eyes for a moment, but her lids grew heavy, and soon her breathing evened out. In that dim cabin, without knowing, she slipped into sleep.
When Brixton finished tying the bandage, he lifted his head and saw her slumped over, fast asleep. Her careless, unguarded slumber stirred something uneasy in him. No woman had ever dared to sleep so peacefully in his presence-not after betrayal, not after blood.

His expression darkened, and he called for Scorpio.
###Chapter 546 You Don't Deserve It
Scorpio burst through the door immediately, his attention drawn straight to the blade lying on the floor. He misread the scene entirely, his expression turning menacing. "Mr. Ward, that woman actually attempted an attack. Don't worry. I'll have her thrown into the sea this instant!"
Brixton's brow creased deeply, his tone carrying clear irritation."When did I issue orders to dispose of her overboard?"
Scorpio faltered,clearly bewildered. "What? Didn't she attempt to murder you?" He gestured toward the weapon on the floor.
"No," Brixton responded with icy composure. "She didn't try anything."
Scorpio grew even more perplexed and ventured carefully,"Then what are your instructions, Mr.Ward?"
Brixton's gaze returned to Hannah's peaceful sleeping form. He dismissed the matter with an impatient wave. "Transfer her to a different cabin for rest. Her presence here is disruptive to my sleep."

Scorpio instinctively observed Hannah-she lay in tranquil slumber, producing no sound whatsoever. Yet, he dared not challenge his superior's directive and responded respectfully,"Understood, I'll relocate her immediately."

******

Within a shadowy room in Dorbarrow, Erica remained bound to a chair, her features displaying a volatile mixture of terror and rage. "Vincent! Have you completely lost your sanity? What exactly do you think you're doing? This constitutes unlawful
exactly do you think you're doing? This constitutes unlawful imprisonment!"

She fought against her restraints in vain.

Vincent maintained his position before her with complete stoicism, his eyes radiating coldness. "Where is Hannah? Unless you provide that information, you'll never leave this place."

"This violates the law!" Erica attempted using legal intimidation as leverage.

"Violates the law?" Vincent appeared to find this enormously amusing, a frigid smile touching his lips. "Who possesses evidence of wrongdoing? You initiated the kidnapping.Considering I haven't harmed you physically and am simply accommodating you as my 'guest' here, I'd suggest my treatment remains remarkably civilized."

His investigative team had returned from the island with troubling reports. The island had endured a catastrophic explosion that destroyed the whole fortress. Only blackened debris and unrecognizable remains persisted, yielding no useful intelligence. This pushed his worry and exasperation to unbearable levels.

His attention was fixed on the encrypted device confiscated from Erica. "Is this how you communicate with them?"

Erica pressed her lips together firmly, refusing to respond.

"The password," Vincent demanded, his voice completely stripped of any warmth.

Erica maintained her stubborn silence, attempting resistance through non-cooperation.

Vincent's remaining patience evaporated as he seized her throat with crushing force.

The pressure proved so intense that breathing became
The pressure proved so intense that breathing became impossible, her complexion shifting from deep crimson to an alarming purple shade.
"The password!" Vincent repeated, the lethal intent blazing in his eyes becoming almost palpable.
Erica gasped desperately, "I'll reveal it! I'll reveal it!" Death's proximity finally shattered her psychological barriers. She managed to force several digits past her constricted throat.
Vincent released his grip, picked up the phone, and swiftly entered the provided code to unlock the device. He navigated directly to the contact directory and asked, "Which one issued orders to you? Point it out!"
Struggling to draw breath, Erica trembled violently as she indicated the uppermost number in the list, which bore no saved name. "The first one."
Vincent immediately dialed the number, but the number was out of service. His expression grew thunderous. Spinning around,he seized Erica by the collar, his voice quaking with barely restrained fury. "Are you toying with me?"
"I'm not! Why would I dare to lie to you when I'm in this situation?" Erica shrieked in terror. "That's simply how their system operates! They can only contact me. I cannot reach them directly! I explained this before-you must wait! Wait for them to make contact. There's absolutely nothing else within my power."

"I cannot wait" Vincent's foot connected violently with the nearby table, sending it crashing to the floor. He remained completely reactive while possessing zero intelligence about his adversary's location.

"Didn't they want money? I've assembled one billion in cash!Why haven't they reached out to you yet?" he bellowed,desperately seeking some rational explanation within the
desperately seeking somne rational explanation within the madness.

Erica cowered at his explosive behavior. "I'm uncertain. Perhaps some complication arose on their side..."

"Some complication?" Vincent's eyes burned with bloodshot intensity. "Erica, you'd better pray for Hannah's well-being!Should any harm befall her, I guarantee you'll curse the day you were born!"

He snatched her phone and marched toward the exit.

Just as he grasped the door handle, Erica suddenly screamed,"Vincent, aren't you concerned about Sharon learning of this?You're treating me this way! I'm her cherished adopted daughter! If she learned how you've handled me, imagine her devastation!"

Vincent's steps halted. Without turning back, his voice carried unwavering determination. "You forfeit any right to invoke her name. When you orchestrated your fake death and vanished,did you ever stop to consider how she might react? Following your supposed death, I told her you had an accidental death.She became physically ill from mourning and required months to recover gradually. I will never reveal your existence to her,nor allow her to witness your current state. Because you don't deserve it. You would only taint the sincere feelings she had for you!"

With that declaration, he slammed the door shut and departed without a backward glance.
###Chapter 547 The Price For Betrayal
The cruise ship drifted endlessly across the waters,directionless and silent.

Within the cabin, Hannah stirred from her deep sleep, startled to find Brixton's face hovering inches away.

A jolt of panic coursed through her as she recoiled, her body colliding harshly with the icy surface of the cabin wall. Her voice trembled as she demanded, "What are you doing?"

Brixton rose with deliberate ease, studying the alarm in her expression. A faintly mocking tone laced his words."You sleep so soundly that it's almost charming-another moment and you might have drooled."

Her hand instinctively brushed the edge of her lips, relieved to discover them dry, realizing she'd been teased. Annoyance flared, and she shot him a sharp glare. "What else can a hostage do except sleep? Shouldn't a wounded man like you be in bed instead of creeping around watching others? Tell me,who's more abnormal here?"

Instead of offense, Brixton found her defiance amusing. A low laugh rumbled from his throat. "Interesting... I'll take it as a compliment on my resilience."

Suddenly,Hannah's stomach betrayed her, the loud growl echoing in the still air and reminding her of the hunger gnawing at her insides. She asked evenly,′′|a hostage allowed to eat?"

Weakness pressed heavily on her frame-she truly felt she might collapse from starvation.

Brixton lifted a brow, clearly savoring her forced composure,
Brixton lifted a brow, clearly savoring her forced composure,his voice deliberately taunting. "And what if I refuse?"

Rolling her eyes, she abandoned resistance and turned her back on him, sinking once more onto the bunk. "Then I won't eat. I'll just rest until I regain my strength. We can talk after-or never.It's up to you."

Her reaction seemed to delight him further. A chuckle escaped."Alright. Get up and come along."

Hannah rose and trailed him out of the cabin.

Night had swallowed the sky by the time they emerged on deck.

But the moment she stepped outside, the pungent scent of blood struck her senses, twisting her stomach.

Her gaze darted toward the crew, who scrubbed furiously with hoses and stiff brushes, their spray a grotesque mixture of seawater and human blood.

Not far off, Scorpio barked orders, overseeing two men as they strung up a corpse against the mast.

The sight froze her blood. Her body revolted, and she stumbled to the railing, retching violently. With nothing in her stomach, only bitter bile escaped.

Pale and trembling, she turned to Brixton's impassive figure."What's happening? Why is there a dead body hanging here?"

Brixton turned his head, observing her stricken face, lips curling into a cruel smile. "Why? You mean you truly don't know?"

Her brows knitted tightly. "What is it I should know?"

His words were casual, almost conversational. "While you slept we uncovered a traitor. The purge got messy-blood spilled,lives lost."
He tilted his head, a smirk tugging at his mouth. "You're fortunate. Had you wandered out, you might have been mistaken for the enemy and cut down. You could say I saved you once again."
Her thoughts snapped together in clarity. So that was why he had commented on her peaceful slumber earlier.He hadn't merely been idly watching her-he had been eliminating disloyalty. Even during her rest, Brixton had enforced his dominance with ruthless efficiency.
Brixton's eyes shifted toward the dangling body, his lips curving upward. "See that? "That's the price for betrayal."
Hannah forced her gaze away, seething inwardly. This monster treated life as if it were nothing.
Desperate to escape the scene, she muttered, "Could we...Could we eat now?"

Lingering any longer, she feared she would faint from revulsion.

Brixton arched a brow at her reply. "After all that, you still want food?"
Her lips curved in a stiff smile, her tone hollow. "Here, death can strike at any moment. I'd rather face it on a full stomach."

His quiet laugh betrayed amusement, his eyes gleaming with interest. "You carry a curious sort of optimism."

Inside, Hannah felt the bitter twist of irony. If she lost that optimism, madness would claim her. Over and over,she reminded herself of one truth: she still had value. Brixton required her alive for negotiations with Vincent. That was the thread keeping her from being discarded and wiped out.

Luckily, after the purge confirmed her harmlessness-or perhaps from Brixton's belief she couldn't escape-her movements weren't heavily restricted. Within days, she mapped
movements weren't heavily restricted. Within days, she mapped much of the ship's modest structure.

Unwilling to tolerate the greasy, tasteless meals from the cook,Hannah had begun borrowing the galley to prepare her own food.

Unexpectedly,Brixton and Scorpio occasionally ate her food as well.Scorpio mostly consumed her food as a food taster for Brixton.

One evening over a shared meal, Brixton gazed at Hannah and asked idly, "So, do you often cook for Vincent?"
###Chapter 548 Don't Want To Release Her
Hannah kept her eyes lowered, her focus fixed on the plate before her. She had no interest in small talk and offored a clipped response. "No, I rarely cook. Most times, it's either Vincent handling it or the chef on his payroll."

Brixton leaned in, clearly intrigued. "They say a man's heart is won through his stomach, yeah? Don't you worry that he might drift if you don't cook for him?"

Hannah lacked the patience for such intrusive questions, but given the circumstances, she calmly replied, "If he ever decides to walk away, it won't be because I don't cook. It'll be because I wasn't enough to make him stay."

Inside,she felt certain-Vincent cherished her for who she was,not for her kitchen skills. Besides, she despised the greasy haze of cooking fumes, and he never pressured her to cook. The only reason she was cooking here was survival-and her selective palate demanded it.

Across the table, Brixton began asking calculated questions about her and Vincent. Hannah answered vaguely, never offering anything revealing.

Maybe it was the few days of tension-free coexistence-or maybe Brixton genuinely liked her food-but the air tonight lacked its usual hostility.

Eventually, Hannah decided to test the waters. She looked up and asked carefully, "Have you managed to reach Vincent?"

Brixton met her gaze, eyes narrowing. "Getting anxious? Missing him?"
She didn't pretend otherwise. "Yes. I miss him."

His expression darkened slightly, but his voice remained flat."Then you'll be disappointed. The ship's comms got busted during the cleanup a few days ago. No one's reachable right now."

Her chest tightened. "How long will we be stuck out here?"

The days had blurred together. She no longer knew how long she'd been aboard, how long she'd been their prisoner.

"That's not something you need to worry about as a hostage,"Brixton replied coldly. "When the time comes, you'll see him."

Understanding that the conversation had reached its limit,Hannah said nothing more. She placed her utensils down,rose from her seat, and muttered, "I'm done. Enjoy your meal."

Without glancing back, she exited the dining room.

Scorpio watched her go and leaned toward Brixton. "Mr. Ward,she seemed pissed. As a hostage, she should act like one.I could have someone remind her of her place."

Brixton stabbed another bite with his fork, eyes unreadable."No need."

Scorpio hesitated and then added under his breath, "Mr. Ward,the comms aren't entirely dead. The satellite line's still working.Why-"

A sharp look from Brixton froze him mid-sentence.

"Why the hurry?" Brixton said quietly, setting his fork down."Have you forgotten? We're after more than just Vincent's money. Handing over Hannah for a ransom now would be too easy on him. The timing isn't right. Let him spiral for a while-lost, frantic, out of options. I want him to become a headless chicken. The more restless he becomes, the more it plays into our hands."

Realization flickered in Scorpio's eyes. "Right, right! You're wise!You're always ten steps ahead."

But Brixton said nothing more. That wasn't the whole story.There was another reason, one he hadn't voiced-not even to himself. He didn't actually want to release Hannah. Not yet.Something was captivating about her-the way she kept her cool,the flash of stubbornness behind those eyes, the softness she tried to hide. Plus, she cooked well.

He rarely felt anything but irritation around women,but Hannah?She was... different. That alone made her worth keeping around for a while.

"She's not bad in the kitchen," Brixton said aloud, his tone detached. "With the transfer to the new vessel coming up, she can handle the banquet."

Scorpio blinked, caught off guard, and then quickly nodded."Understood! I'll get it sorted."

What neither man realized was that Hannah hadn't gone far.She stood just beyond the dining room, hidden in the hallway's curve, having overheard every word that followed her exit.
###Chapter 549 You're Going To Love It

Hannah slipped away from the dining room doorway without a sound and rushed back to her cabin.

Behind the closed door, she tried to process everything she'd just overheard. It turned out that the communication devices weren't broken after all. They could contact Vincent whenever they wanted. Instead, they were stalling on purpose, letting Vincent drown in anxiety and despair to gain leverage in whatever negotiations or deals lay ahead.

It seemed that Brixton's desire extended far beyond mere money. But what else could he possibly want from Vincent?More troubling still was their plan to switch ships in just a few days. What had sparked this sudden change? Come to think of it,why hadn't they docked anywhere yet?

Each question felt like another stone dropping into her chest,weighing her heart down. Her situation couldn't be more passive. Brixton held complete control over her fate.

The only bright spot, if it could even be called that, was Brixton's growing satisfaction with her cooking. Perhaps this tiny crack in his armor was her only chance at finding a way out.

Taking a steadying breath, Hannah forced her fraying nerves to calm. A larger cruise ship would definitely come equipped with lifeboats. Maybe she could steal one for her escape.

Yet, she quickly abandoned the notion. Out on the endless,unpredictable sea, piloting a small boat alone without proper supplies would be nothing short of suicide. Her best hope lay in exploiting Brixton's increasing trust in her.

She had to find a way to access the communication equipment.
 She had to find a way to access the communication equipment.Vincent's phone number was burned into her memory. Even a few seconds of contact might be enough to turn everything around.

A few days later, Brixton indeed ordered a change of ship.

Slowly, a magnificent white cruise ship approached them across the water, far larger and more luxurious than their current vessel.

Standing on deck, Brixton watched the approaching ship with barely contained excitement dancing across his features.

Hannah swallowed her rising panic and made her way to the ship's railing. Gripping the metal with trembling hands, she let her face go pale and retched dryly several times, playing up her supposed seasickness. Furrowing her brow, she managed a weak complaint. "Can't we just make port somewhere? All this constant rocking is making me miserable. I may be your hostage,but shouldn't you treat me a bit more nicely?"

Brixton glanced over at her, amusement and mockery glinting in his eyes. "Dock somewhere? What makes you think we'd need to do that? That beautiful ship is going to serve as our home and new base for a long while. How do you like it?"

A new base? Cold horror shot through her veins as the implications hit home. They might not make port for a long time,perhaps forever, completely isolating themselves from the world. Without Brixton actively reaching out,Vincent would have no way of tracking her down.

Watching her expression crumble, Brixton's amusement only grew. He stepped closer, his voice deliberately taunting."What's wrong? You look unhappy."

Hannah lowered her gaze, masking the shock in her eyes while keeping up her act. "If you were seasick for so many days in a row, you wouldn't be happy either.

Brixton's laughter boomed across the deck as he gave her shoulder a patronizing pat. "Relax! That cruise ship is rock solid,a hundred times more comfortable than this floating junkyard we're leaving behind. Besides, there's all sorts of entertainment waiting for you on board. Trust me, you're going to love it!"

Hannah's blood ran cold at his enthusiasm. Whatever Brixton considered entertaining was bound to be anything but pleasant.

Soon, everyone began to board the luxurious cruise ship.

The vessel truly was spectacular, featuring three sprawling decks decorated with opulent detail.

Yet, the moment Hannah set foot on the first deck, she froze in disbelief at what greeted her.

This wasn't some elegant lounge. Thick smoke choked the air of a bustling casino. Crowds pressed around gaming tables of every variety. Victory cheers mixed with bitter curses as fortunes rose and fell, creating an atmosphere of manic desperation.

Surveying his domain with obvious pride, Brixton called out loudly, "Everyone, enjoy yourselves to the fullest! Food and drinks are on the house! Our casino never closes!"

Hannah trailed silently behind him, watching the gamblers cycle between wild euphoria and crushing despair, her stomach turning with revulsion.

Just as she thought the first deck was shocking enough, what awaited her on the second deck made her blood turn to ice. 
###Chapter 550
Brixton followed, leisurely watching her disheveled state, even reaching out to pat her back.

Hannah recoiled instantly, as if his hand carried venom,dodging his touch and wiping her mouth roughly with her sleeve.

Brixton showed no irritation; instead, he smiled and gestured toward a large suite on the third deck. "This will be your room.Well? Much better than the cramped little cabin you had before,isn't it?"

Hannah ignored his comment about the room. Lifting her chin,her eyes sharp and unwavering, she asked, "I want to leave.When will you let me go?"

Everything around her-casinos, organ trafficking, human trading-was suffocating. Every extra second here was sheer torment.

Brixton's smile faded. For a few moments, he was silent. Then,he said slowly, "Not yet."

Hannah's heart sank like a stone into deep water. She realized Brixton wasn't merely using her to squeeze money out of Vincent. He was savoring the process of control, delighting in watching both her and Vincent writhe in despair.

She said nothing more, turned away, and fell into a silence as heavy as death.

Her first night aboard the luxury cruise was restless beyond words. Again and again she jolted awake from nightmares,catching only fragments of sleep until dawn finally broke.

The morning sun had barely risen when someone knocked brusquely on her door.

Scorpio's cold voice rang out. "Up! From now on, you'll prepare meals for Mr. Ward and me. The kitchen's on the lower deck.Breakfast-now."
Hannah opened her eyes wearily, pressing down her disgust and frustration. She rose in silence. She knew resistance would be like throwing eggs at a stone-it would only shatter her further.For now, the only path was to play the obedient chef,carefully maintaining Brixton's fragile trust while waiting for even the smallest chance.

In the days that followed, she spent most of her time in the kitchen. She forced herself to focus on chopping and seasoning,shutting out the inferno above her.

More than once, she noticed Scorpio leave an encrypted phone either on the kitchen counter or clipped to his belt. That phone glimmered before her eyes like forbidden fruit.

She knew it was her only hope of reaching the outside world.But she also knew that if she failed, the price would be unbearable. She would have to wait for the one chance that left no room for error.

Then one day,the atmosphere on the ship shifted sharply.

A line of bodyguards in black took up positionsat every entrance, standing like statues. The usually noisy casino was emptied,leaving only the central hall where a tense gathering of men created an atmosphere thick enough to cut with a knife.

Scorpio strode into the kitchen, face dark. "Today's guest is no ordinary man. Rodger Pearce-the Black Dragons' leader. He's here to settle old scores with Mr. Ward. Prepare lunch and deliver it yourself to the casino. Hurry."

Hannah froze. Rodger Pearce from the Black Dragons? She vaguely remembered Brixton once saying the men who raided the island fortress were from Black Dragons. Blood was bound to stain the decks before this day ended.

Not daring to waste a moment, Hannah quickly prepared the dishes, arranged them neatly on a tray, and followed Scorpio down to the first deck.

In the middle of the casino, Brixton sat across from a middle-aged man with eyes sharp as blades. Behind each stood their followers, hard-faced and silent, the tension heavy as thunderclouds.

Hannah kept her head down, wanting only to set the tray in place and slip out before trouble exploded.

But just as she turned to leave, Brixton's voice rang out."Wait."

Hannah stopped, dread crawling up her spine.

Brixton turned to Rodger, a grin stretching across his face as he gestured toward Hannah. "Rodger, what's the fun in plain negotiations? Why not spice it up with a wager? And for the dealer..."

His gaze locked on Hannah, a smirk curling at his lips. "Let her do it."
###Chapter 551 Forced To Be The Dealer

Hannah's heart plummeted like a stone dropped into deep water. She shook her head at once, refusing firmly. "Mr. Ward,I've never done this before, and I don't even know the rules.You already have professional dealers in your casino-let them handle it. I truly can't."

Brixton let out a low chuckle, laced with a sinister amusement."Ah,you didn't know that my charming female dealers have all been wiped out by Rodger." His words sounded casual, yet the undertone was colder than ice. "Take a look over there-they've already been tossed into the sea."

Hannah followed the gesture, and through the porthole,she saw men hurling lifeless women overboard, their bodies swallowed by the waves. Her eyes swept across the gambling hall once more. Aside from herself, not a single woman remained. A chill ran from the soles of her feet up her spine,leaving her skin crawling.

Rodger, evidently impatient, slammed his palm on the table with a thunderous crack. His glare was as sharp as daggers."What are you stalling for? Keep babbling and I'll kill you right now!"

Hannah's face drained of color, her fingers turning icy cold.She turned to Brixton, clinging to the fragile hope. "If I refuse, will I die?"

Brixton met her haunted gaze, his smile never wavering, though his voice cut like a blade. "Of course. Rodger won't spare you,and I won't tolerate a woman who dares to disobey. Fish food would be mercy compared to what awaits you."

Her heart sank into a pit of despair. There was no way out
Her heart sank into a pit of despair. There was no way out.Drawing in a deep breath, she swallowed her fear. "Give me a few minutes."

Leaning toward a man beside her, clearly a veteran gambler,she whispered in a rush, firing off questions about shuffling methods and the dealer's routine. Her thoughts raced at lightning speed, locking every word into memory with fierce determination.

Brixton, tapping his fingers idly against the table, watched her with quiet amusement, not urging her.

Rodger,on the other hand, burst out in impatience, "Enough!Hurry it up! Do you think I won't kill her this instant?"

Brixton lifted a hand smoothly, smiling as if soothing a child."Rodger, calm down. She's a valuable hostage with powerful connections. You can't just kill her. And besides, even a flower needs a little time to bloom. What's a few minutes?"

At last, Hannah lifted her head. Though herface remained pale,her eyes no longer wavered. She stepped to the center of the table, facing the two gang leaders, and said through taut breath,"I'm ready."

Brixton's lips curved with satisfaction. He turned to Rodger."Rodger, it's settled then-one round to determine the winner.The simplest rule-high card wins. If you lose, you and your men walk off my ship, and every debt is erased."

Rodger sneered, his eyes gleaming with greed and malice,"Fine!But if you lose, Brixton, your ship is mine. Do you dare?"

Brixton arched a brow, his tone smooth as silk. "Quite the appetite, Rodger. But aren't you afraid it'll be too much for you?"Leaning forward slightly, his gaze hardened. "Let's begin."

Every eye in the hall fixed upon Hannah.

Her palms grew slick with cold sweat, but she steadied her
Her palms grew slick with cold sweat, but she steadied her breathing, refusing to falter. She gathered the deck,recalling each step she had just learned, and though her motions were clumsy, they carried a desperate precision. She shuffled, cut,and placed the cards in the center, offering the final cut to the players.

Rodger gave a dismissive snort and sliced the deck carelessly.

Brixton, in contrast, merely tapped the stack with easy elegance, signaling he was content to leave it as it was. His gaze lingered with mock amusement on Hannah's strained profile.

Hannah drew in another breath and began dealing.

By the simplest rule, each player received two cards face down and then revealed them for comparison.

Card after card was dealt, landing in front of Brixton and Rodger.

"One more," Rodger said, tapping the table. He peeked at his pair of cards, clearly displeased.

Without hesitation, Hannah slid a third card his way.

Brixton chuckled and tapped lightly as well. "I'll take one too."

Brixton's eyes stayed locked on Rodger's.

Then, Brixton leaned back, his gesture almost polite. "Reveal your cards."
###Chapter 552 Win The Bet

Rodger's gaze gleamed with dark amusement, a wicked curl tugging at his mouth as he snapped his wrist to unveil the three cards clutched between his fingers.

It revealed a two of spades, a nine of hearts, and the freshly placed card-the nine of diamonds.

"Twenty points!" one of Rodger's loyal men barked in triumph,their restrained cheer rumbling low across the table.

Rodger slouched back in his seat with the air of a king savoring a reachable win, his lips curling in smug pleasure as his eyes locked on Brixton with a deliberately taunting spark.

In this pared-down but ruthless game, twenty points stood as a formidable hand, the kind that could all but guarantee victory.

Every gaze in the room swung toward Brixton.

Brixton's smile, steady and faintly playful, had not budged. With deliberate calm, he lifted his cards one by one.

First, the ten of clubs. Then, the two of diamonds. The sum was a mere twelve.

Rodger's smirk deepened, his certainty swelling, convinced that triumph was already his.

Just as Brixton's hand brushed the last card to overturn it,Hannah felt her breath falter and her pulse jolt violently in her chest.

Only moments earlier, Hannah's flawless memories of the deck's progression had revealed the grim truth-if the cards followed their natural sequence, Brixton's last draw would be the three of clubs. That meant fifteen points, a hand doomed
the three of clubs. That meant fifteen points, a hand doomed to collapse against Rodger's.

So when she dealt the third card, with a flick so subtle that it could have been mistaken for chance, she'd slid the three of clubs away, concealing it within the folds of her sleeve. In its place, she'd finessed a nine of spades, stolen clean from the bottom of the deck, and laid it before Brixton.

The gamble was madness-if uncovered, it would spell her death. Yet, her conviction burned. If her calculation was precise,Brixton would not lose the game.

Right now, Hannah's chest thundered as her eyes fastened on Brixton's final card.

With an unhurried motion, Brixton revealed it. A nine of spades.Together, his hand rose to a flawless twenty-one.

Hannah's pulse hammered, though her face betrayed nothing.Her voice rang clear and steady. "Twenty-one against twenty.Brixton claims the win."

Rodger's smug mask cracked apart, freezing into disbelief before twisting into raw fury. "Impossible-you cheated!" he thundered, slamming his palm down and launching to his feet.His finger jabbed at Hannah with venom. "No hand hits twenty -one so clean! You rigged it for him! You conniving whore!"

Rodger's men bristled instantly, metal flashing as guns leapt into their hands.

Brixton's men, equally unyielding, answered in kind, raising their own weapons.

The room locked into a deadly equilibrium, the air thick with the promise of blood.

"Still can't handle losing, can you, Rodger?" Brixton said calmly,his tone cool and edged with mockery. "The rules are binding,and the dealer's verdict is final. What? Planning to renege?"
The ice in his stare cut sharper than his words.

Rodger's complexion flamed. "You dare mock me? You and that woman are conspiring to rob me blind! I'll see this vessel burn for your audacity in tricking me!"

Rodger's hand twitched, his crew's fingers tightening around their triggers.

Then, a single shot cracked, muffled and close. It came from beneath the table.

Rodger froze, eyes widening in disbelief as he glanced down at a bloodstain spreading fast across his chest. His lips moved,forming words that never came. His body buckled, crashing backward, lifeless before he hit the floor.

The casino drowned in silence. The shock was palpable, no one daring to breathe.

Brixton's hand slid calmly from beneath the table, a compact pistol gleaming in his grip. His expression carried no pity, only cool dismissal. "A man who can't stomach defeat isn't worth the air he breathes." His eyes swept across Rodger's shaken subordinates. "Who else wishes to follow him in death?"

Fear rippled through Rodger's men. Their weapons faltered and then lowered, their courage collapsing as they stared at the corpse of their leader.

Brixton's lips curved with easy satisfaction. He gave a careless wave, as though brushing aside an inconvenience. "Alright,since the eyesore's gone, let's keep the fun going. Drinks are on me. Have a blast, everyone!"

The music struck up. Shock softened into uneasy laughter, and soon the revelry returned, urged on by Brixton's men until the crowd willingly drowned itself in pleasure once more.

Rodger's body was carried away, his blood erased from the
Rodger's body was carried away, his blood erased from the polished floor, the hall returning to its decadent mask of sin.

In the midst of the chaos, Hannah's sharp eyes caught Scorpio -he was entirely preoccupied with keeping his men moving,barking orders to steady the shaken room. The satellite phone at his waist had slipped out during the commotion.

Her opportunity came! Her breath surged as she let herself stumble forward, clutching the edge of the table as if dizzy from the aftermath. Step by step, she brushed past Scorpio's back.

Her hand darted, swift and practiced. A whisper of contact, and the device slid seamlessly into her sleeve.

The theft was over before a heartbeat passed.

Hannah steadied herself, pressing her hand to her chest,feigning tremors of shock. She backed intothe corner with the crowd, her expression innocent.

But inside, her triumph rang clear-she had it. She had succeeded.
###Chapter 553 Divert Suspicion
Hannah ducked her head and sprinted for the third deck,her pulse hammering in her ears.

The phone in her grip blessedly didn't need a password-she jabbed in Vincent's number with shaking fingers. Silence answered.

Tension gripped her frame, every nerve on edge as she listened intently for movement from downstairs.

At last, the line clicked and Vincent's voice came through-right as footsteps rang sharply from the stairwell.

Her blood went cold. Without a second thought, she flung the phone overboard, the splash swallowed by the sea.

Gripping the railing, she bent forward, feigning nausea,her hair falling like a curtain around her face.

A voice cut through the air. "What's got you bolting up here?Something so fascinating on the third deck?"

It was Brixton who actualy had come up.

A shiver ran down Hannah's spine as cold sweat dampened her back. Forcing a mask of frailty, she hunched over, clutching her chest as if in discomfort. "I couldn't endure it anymore. I had to come up here to throw up. The stench down there..."Her voice cracked. "I couldn't stand it."

Her act was convincing enough to pass.

Brixton strolled closer at a lazy pace, the corners of his mouth curved in a mocking half-smile.′′|sthat all? Just came up here to puke? I assumed you came running up here for something
to puke? I assumed you came running up here for something special."

The teasing edge in his voice carried a sharper note of doubt.

Hannah's heart thudded so hard that it nearly drowned out her thoughts-he was suspicious. She gritted her teeth, silently ordering herself not to panic.

Hannah jerked her head up, fury flashing in her eyes as her voice sharpened. "Something special? Brixton, what do you take me for? I had a gun in my face-cards I'd never dealt shoved into my hands-and you slaughtered a man right in front of me. Blood everywhere. I was scared out of my mind!Now that it's finally over, I'm sick to my stomach and just wanted to catch my breath and throw up. Is that a crime? Or do you think even the way I breathe is suspicious? What exactly are you accusing me of?"

Her rapid-fire questions slammed into him, slightly easing the suspicion in his eyes. His eyes narrowed, amusement curling at the edges, as though he found her furious outburst more entertaining than threatening.

Brixton's unblinking stare lingered on Hannah, the silence pressing down until her chest ached.

Summoning what little courage she had, she squared her shoulders and snapped, "What the hell are you staring at?You've treated me like a criminal and suspected me. Am I not allowed to be upset? Aren't you the one in charge here?There's chaos downstairs-shouldn't you be dealing with that instead of hovering over a hostage who's about to pass out from vomiting?"

A low laugh slipped from Brixton as he stepped closer,his voice dipping into a taunting drawl. "But why do you look so uneasy?"

Hannah's mouth tightened, the fight seemingly draining from
Hannah's mouth tightened, the fight seemingly draining from her. "Go ahead and think whatever you want. No matter what I do, I'm guilty in your eyes."

Brixton's stare was cold and unyielding. "Scorpio just noticed his phone's gone missing. Funny how it disappeared right after the gambling round-right in the middle of the chaos."

Her hunch was right. He did come for the phone. Her stomach knotted, but she forced her features into wide-eyed confusion."His phone's missing? Then go find it. What's that got to do with me?"

Brixton's mouth curved into a glacial smile. "That's exactly what I'm doing-starting with you."

Before she could react, his hand shot out, patting her down without ceremony.

Her whole body went rigid. He really did suspect her. Thank goodness she'd hurled the phone into the sea earlier, or she'd be finished.

Brixton's search turned up nothing in Hannah's pockets, but when his hand slid down her sleeve, his fingers brushed something solid. It wasn't the size or shape of a phone.

Surprise flickered through Brixton's gaze when he pulled the thing out, revealing a single card: the three of clubs.

It was the same card Hannah had secretly swapped out in play.

He asked, shocked and confused, "Why are you carrying this?"

Hannah noted that the question seemed to divert his attention.She seized the chance and lunged, making it look like she tried to snatch the card back. "What do you think? You wouldn't have won half as easily if I hadn't pulled that off."

Brixton raised the card out of her reach. A sharp thought struck him, and his gaze turned cutting. "So you rigged that round?"
Hannah gave a tense nod, deliberately letting fear flicker in her eyes. "Yeah..." She lowered her head, her voice dropping to a near whisper. "It was too urgent. I was afraid that if you lost,we'd both be dead. I had to do something, so I swapped in a card I knew."

She turned her confession into an act of desperate survival,even making it sound like she'd done it for him.

Brixton studied her for a long moment before throwing back his head in sudden laughter. "Unbelievable! So that explains why you were so on edge. You've got nerve, Hannah. Do you even realize what would've happened if Rodger had caught the slightest slip?"

"It's already over! What's the damn use of bringing it up now?"she retorted sharply, feigning fright as she edged back, though a thread of defiance laced her tone. "And besides, isn't he gone?"

Brixton threw his head back and laughed harder, thrilled by her audacity. "So what you're saying is I won the game, put that old rival down for good, and it's all thanks to you, my clever little hostage?"
###Chapter 554 Evaporated Into Thin Air
Hannah immediately ducked her head and adopted a servile tone, though internally, she was fighting the urge to roll her eyes. "I wouldn't dare. You were the one who'd shot decisively."

She didn't dare take credit.

Brixton's mood had clearly improved dramatically as he kept fondling that three of clubs. "I'm keeping this card as a memento."

Hannah's mind reeled with disbelief. His twisted collecting obsession was really baffling. Outwardly, she remained perfectly compliant. "Whatever pleases you. Everything on this ship belongs to you anyway."

She seized the moment to make her reqquest. "I'm absolutely exhausted and feeling sick right now. I need to go back and rest. Please don't disturb me tonight. Even hostages deserve adequate sleep."

Brixton appeared to lose all interest in her activities and dismissed her with a casual wave. "Go on then."

Relief flooded through Hannah as she immediately spun around and hurried toward her cabin.

The instant she shut the door behind her, her knees buckled and she slumped against it, desperately trying to catch her breath. She'd actually pulled it off. One simple playing card had successfully deflected Brixton's suspicions about the missing phone.

Once Hannah departed, Scorpio quickly reported to Brixton."Mr.Ward, the majority of Rodger's crew has agreed to switch
"Mr. Ward, the majority of Rodger's crew has agreed to switch sides and join us."

Brixton's response came flatand emotionless. "Good. Any luck finding your phone?"

Scorpio shook his head grimly. "Still nothing. We've torn this place apart but haven't located it anywhere."

Brixton didn't seem too concerned. "Forget it. It's just a phone.Make sure to remotely wipe all the encrypted data for security purposes."

Scorpio nodded briskly. "Consider it done. I'll take care of it immediately."

Meanwhile, in Dorbarrow, Vincent paced inside the executive suite atop the Jones Group tower.

Days had crawled by painfully. Hannah had been missing for several days despite their relentless search.

Erica kept refusing to yield any useful information, offering nothing but that infuriating mantra: "Wait for them to make contact."

Vincent had thrown every resource at his disposal into the search, both legitimate and underground, dangling an enormous bounty, yet it was like shouting into an abyss with no echo returning. Whoever had taken Hannah had vanished completely, leaving no trace behind.

This frustration and loss of control were slowly driving Vincent toward the brink of madness. His eyes burned red with exhaustion and fury, radiating such dangerous energy that everyone instinctively gave him wide berth.

Even Derek, his most loyal assistant, barely dared to breathe when delivering updates.
"Mr. Jones, we've hit another dead end. We've combed through every piece of surveillance footage from the ports,highways, and airports multiple times, but there's absolutely no trace of suspicious vehicles or individuals leaving with Ms. Scott.She seemed to have evaporated into thin air." Exhaustion and defeat weighed heavily in Derek's voice.

Vincent's eyes blazed with barely contained fury, his voice coming out as a ragged whisper. "Evaporated into thin air?People don't just vanish like magic tricks."

Suddenly,Vincent's private phone buzzed against the desk surface. The screen flashed to life, showing an unknown number with no location data attached.

Vincent's pulse spiked as a strong gut feeling seized him.His private line was locked down tight, known only to a handful of trusted contacts. Random calls were virtually impossible. Could this be some sick joke? A scam?Or...

Just as the call was about to roll to voicemail, he lunged forward and snatched up the phone. "Hello?" Wariness crept into his tone.

Nothing but silence greeted him from the other end.

The connection felt hollow, as though someone had dialed by accident or the signal was barely functioning.

Then, the line went dead.

The entire call had lasted less than three seconds.

Vincent stood completely motionless. The next instant, he bellowed at Derek, "Track that number's signal right now.Move!Throw every resource we have at this, cost be damned. I need to know exactly where that call originated!"

The Jones Group's elite technical squad sprang into action.Every tracking tool at their disposal-satellites, cell towers,
Every tracking tool at their disposal-satellites, cell towers.everything-went online immediately.

Vincent couldn't stop pacing around his office. Those three fleeting seconds replayed endlessly in his mind like a broken record. He felt certain it had been Hannah trying to reach him.

Minutes ticked by before Derek burst back through the door,his expression caught between triumph and concern. "Mr.Jones, we've got something. We managed to catch the signal,but..."

"But what?" Vincent froze mid-step, his stare cutting through Derek like a blade.

"The signal's incredibly weak and keeps fluctuating, like they're using some kind of military-grade encryption and anti-tracking technology. The location data is all over the place." The technical supervisor's voice crackled through Derek's speakerphone. "We only managed to grab a brief signal burst,with the approximate location somewhere in international waters. But we can't nail down the exact coordinates. The signal just vanished completely, like something jammed it or cut the connection instantly."
###Chapter 555 Looking For Hannah
International waters? A jolt of realization pierced Vincent's mind.No wonder every lead in Dorbarrow and across the entire country had collapsed into nothingness. The truth struck him like a blow-those who had taken Hannah away were never on land to begin with.

And then fury and dread rose within him like a violent tide,surging uncontrollably. International waters... It meant lawlessness-a boundless gulf where restraint vanished, and illegitimate activities could unfold unchecked.

Vincent's voice cut like steel as he commanded, "Summon the swiftest private yacht, gather every available vessel we control,and outfit them with the most advanced tracking and communication gear we possess. We depart for international waters at once!"

"Yes, Mr. Jones!" Derek answered briskly, already pivoting to set everything in motion.

"Wait!" Vincent's voice cracked through the air, halting Derek.His gaze hardened into lethal frost. "Notify Gavin of our suspicions. Demand international maritime coordination and support. Tell him | suspect a massive transnational crime network is operating aboard that ship. The kidnappings and detentions are nothing more than the surface of something far darker."

Vincent resolved to leave no stone unturned in that vast stretch of sea. He would bring Hannah home, no matter what.

Vincent continued, his tone edged with unyielding resolve,"One more thing, arm our people. Should resistance arise, they have clearance to act with absolute force."
Derek felt a chill in his heart. "Understood!"

Vincent strode to the window, his fists locked tight, knuckles blanching. His lips moved in a silent vow to rescue Hannah.

******

Above the rolling expanse of international waters, Vincent stood on the deck of the Windchaser, his private yacht. The sea air whipped around him, but his brow remained furrowed beneath the crushing weight of determination and restless anxiety.

These past few days, whenever they encountered an unfamiliar ship,they had boarded it for inspection. Yet, all inspections had ended with empty holds and disappointment. He had ceased counting the endless days drifting in futility.

"Mr. Jones, we've spotted another cruise ship up ahead. It's quite large and brightly lit," a subordinate reported quietly.

Vincent's eyes sharpened to slits. Without hesitation, he commanded, "Close in. Standard procedure-four of us,blending in as tourists."

"Understood."

Soon,they boarded the cruise ship.

The moment Vincent's feet touched the deck, he sensed something amiss. A casino glittered before him, sprawling and ostentatious. It was the first true large-scale floating casino he had encountered in all these days at sea.

Vincent and his men dispersed, dissolving into the raucous crowd.

Vincent drifted through the throng, outwardly idle, but every glance was a blade, carving through the scene in search of one face. But Hannah wasn't there. The women here were scarce -powdered, painted, draped across gamblers like ornaments
 -powdered, painted, draped across gamblers like ornaments.None of them was Hannah.

It seemed it was another hollow pursuit. He was becoming numb to the torment-hope flickering alive, only to be snuffed out cruelly each time.

Vincent was about to signal his men to retreat when voices at a nearby gambling table drifted into his ears.

"Brixton's luck that night was unreal-the Black Dragons 'leader lost his temper."

"Quiet down! But honestly, do you think Brixton's win was genuine or rigged?"

"Of course, it was genuine. He's the one calling the shots here.He doesn't need tricks."

"I'm not saying he cheated-I meant that stunning dealer. Her hands... They're uncanny. Do you think-"

"Stop it! Brixton seems to value her quite a bit. Don't run your mouth unless you want trouble. But no one has seen her for days. Has something happened to her?"

"Doubt it. Word is, she spends most of her time below deck,preparing Brixton's meals, rarely stepping into the casino.Anyway,place your bets."

Vincent caught the key information-there was a woman on the lower deck. His gaze snapped toward the staircase descending below. Could Hannah be imprisoned there?

Vincent moved instinctively, drawn toward the entrance, but just as he neared, a shadow loomed across his path.

It was Scorpio.

"Apologies, sir. This area is restricted. No guests allowed below,"Scorpio said, his eyes wary.

Vincent halted at once. With immense self-control, he suppressed the emotions boiling within him. He couldn't force his way in; he couldn't alert them. If Hannah were really trapped down there, any reckless attempt would spell catastrophe.

Vincent's features shifted seamlessly into embarrassment. He let out a dry laugh, muttering, "Forgive me, I thought the bathrooms were below."

Scorpio pointed impassively in another direction. "Facilities are that way."

"Much obliged." Vincent nodded, noting in the corner of his vision that Scorpio's vigilance remained unbroken, his gaze tracking him relentlessly.

Vincent strode to the indicated restroom, lingered inside,splashed icy water across his face, and forced his pulse back into rhythm. When he reemerged, he played the part flawlessly -ambling back to the tables, sliding chips across the felt,wagering small sums like a careless gambler.

As he lifted a chip between his fingers, the door to the lower deck creaked open, and someone emerged.
###Chapter 556 You'd Better Take lt
Vincent raised his eyes, but a bustling crowd blocked his view.All he caught was the fleeting hem of a dress, yet he was certain a woman had just ascended the stairs.

Vincent battled the overwhelming impulse to pursue her and confirm his suspicions. Upstairs... The cruise ship boasted several decks above. What if Hannah was truly here? No way!A chilling inner voice sliced through his thoughts. She'd better not be here.

This ship was a perilous place; every second she spent here would be fraught with danger and torment. He'd prefer she were anywhere else-somewhere safer. Hope and fear waged war within him.

Ultimately, Vincent pushed his chips across the table, rising from the gambling table with an impassive expression, as though merely bored. His men trailed him as he exited.

Once back aboard the Windchaser, Vincent issued a sharp command. "Scrutinize that ship. I want its blueprints, crew roster, and activity logs-especially for the lower deck and every upper guest cabin. I need all details as quickly as possible."

In the control room, the technical supervisor projected the compiled data onto a large screen. "Mr. Jones, we've investigated. That ship, named the Odin, isn't just a gambling hub-it's a front for smuggling, money laundering, and human trafficking, run by an international crime syndicate. Its security is exceptional, armed with heavy weaponry."

One of Vincent's subordinates at the back whispered to his colleague, eyes fixed on the screen, "If Ms. Scott is really in a nlace like that, I fear..."
He trailed off, but the implication was unmistakable. In such a treacherous den, a beautiful woman likely faced only two grim fates: becoming a tortured plaything or being dismantled and sold like countless others.

Though the subordinate's voice was hushed, it reached Vincent's ears. HHis gaze turned cold, pinning the subordinate with a menacing stare that drained the subordinate's face of color.

"I-I am sorry, Mr. Jones! I spoke out of turn!" the subordinate stammered,bowing his head in a frantic apology.

Vincent remained silent for a moment, his cold stare on the subordinate, before he finally spoke. "Tomorrow, he's no longer needed here. Send him away."

"Understood," replied Nate Duncan, Vincent's trusted assistant,who promptly signaled for the subordinate to be escorted out.

A heavy silence enveloped the control room, the air thick with tension as no one dared to breathe too loudly.

Vincent's eyes returned to the Odin's blueprint, his jaw clenched tightly. How could he not understand the implication?Every lead suggesting Hannah meeting a tragic fate felt like a smoldering ember in his chest. Yet, he refused to let such uncertainty consume his rationality. He had to see for himself,if only to eliminate the possibility she wasn't there. Without witnessing it with his own eyes, he'd never give up his efforts.

"Nate," Vincent's voice was low, resolute.

"Mr. Jones," Nate responded, bowing his head.

"Two days. I want everyone to memorize Odin's layout down to the last detail. Then, on the third day, we'll board as gangsters,arming ourselves to the teeth and donning disguises-beards and altered appearance." Vincent issued his orders with precision. "No one acts without my command. Our only goal is
precision. "No one acts without my command. Our only goal is to confirm if Hannah is on board. Before boarding Odin,monitor any news about it in the coming days."

"Understood. I'll arrange it immediately," Nate replied, turning to execute the plan.

Meanwhile, on Odin's third deck, Hannah stood gazing over the railing. She'd been making subtle moves lately; perhaps in a few days, Brixton would have no choice but to let her disembark.

Just then, steady footsteps approached from behind. Without turning, she knew it was Brixton.

Brixton stood beside her, silent for a moment before speaking."You've been awfully quiet lately."

Hannah kept her eyes on the horizon. "The more I say, the more guilty I am in your eyes. I'd rather stay silent."

Brixton let out a soft chuckle. "That doesn't sound like the Hannah I know."

In his memory, she was vibrant, but recently, she'd grown unnervingly quiet.

"This is the real me," Hannah replied evenly.

A brief silence settled between them.

Abruptly, Brixton said, "You haven't mentioned wanting to leave in a while." His gaze narrowed to search her face.

Hannah's heart skipped a beat, though her face remained impassive. She even managed a wry smile. "I'm just a hostage here. Do I really get a say? Whether I want to or not, does it change anything?"

Brixton laughed, amused by her response. "You clearly know your place."

Hannah resisted the urge to roll her eyes, maintaining her
)
Hannah resisted the urge to roll her eyes, maintaining her composed facade.

Suddenly, Brixton pulled something from his pocket and held it out to her-a peacock-shaped hairpin studded with red gemstones.

Hannah's brow furrowed in confusion. "What's this?"

"Scorpio took it from a woman on the second deck," Brixton said casually. "You're the only woman on the third deck, so it's yours."

Hannah's mind flashed to the horrors of the second deck that day, her stomach twisting. The hairpin likely belonged to a woman who'd met a gruesome end. She stepped back instinctively, shaking her head. "I don't want it."

Brixton's smnile vanished, his eyes turning cold as ice. "I have this little rule-when I say something, you'd better take it.Otherwise, I don't mind spilling blood for sport."
###Chapter 557 Reluctant To Let Her Go
Brixton advanced,leaving Hannah no room to refuse again.With a swvift motion, he pinned the peacock hairpin into her hair,its cold metal grazing her scalp.

A shiver ran through Hannah, urging her to tear it out immediately.

"Don't remove it," Brixton ordered, his voice cold, as if he'd read her thoughts.

Reluctantly, Hannah left the hairpin in place. She turned back to the sea,swallowing the nausea and dread roiling inside her. Her heart ached for home, for Vincent, more fiercely than ever,but she knew patience was her only ally. If her plan worked,escape was within reach.

Brixton lingered beside her, his eyes drifting to her repeatedly.As he watched her, a twisted sense of satisfaction and possessiveness bloomed within him. Keeping a sharp-witted,beautiful woman like her as a captive, forcing her compliance,was proving more captivating than striking a deal with Vincent.He found himself reluctant to let her go.

Over the next two days, Brixton seemed to uncover a new source of amusement. He started to task Scorpio with collecting lavish items-elegant dresses, glittering jewelry, and more.

Each time, Brixton would claim they were "found" on the second deck and then demand that Hannah wear them to show him. Any hint of hesitation from Hannah's end would spark his displeasure, leaving her no choice but to obey.

Thus, Hannah became an enigma-a hostage draped in
Thus, Hannah became an enigma-a hostage draped in luxurious gowns and adorned with priceless jewels. Her true identity remained a mystery to most, but all knew Brixton quite valued her.

Rumors spread like wildfire, painting her as his "trophy companion." Some even spun tales of her arrogance, claiming she demanded extravagant jewelry and fine clothes.

Hannah found the rumors laughable, almost absurd. She knew Brixton's actions weren't favor but a perverse method of control, treating her like a puppet for his amusement.

Rumors held a dangerous power.

Scorpio, fiercely loyal to Brixton, grew bitter watching his leader lavish attention on a mere hostage-a woman who appeared ungrateful and aloof. His resentment simmered,manifesting in increasingly hostile behavior toward her.

When their paths crossed in thecorridors, he'd block Hannah's way or nitpick her actions, like when she served meals.

Hannah,avoiding conflict, confined herself to her third-deck cabin,venturing to the lower deck only when necessary.

She counted the days in silence; one or two more, and her chance could come.

That evening, after a modest dinner, a sharp knock jolted her cabin door.

Scorpio stood outside, his face etched with impatience and agitation."You! Come with me!" he barked.

Hannah's brow creased. "What's going on?"

"Mr. Ward is sick-high fever, won't break," Scorpio said gruffly."Got any way to help?"

Hannah nearly laughed. "You need a doctor, not me.What can
Hannah nearly laughed. "You need a doctor, not me. What can
I do?"

She was a captive,not a medic.

Scorpio's expression darkened, his voice low. "We don't trust doctors easily. Anyway, he's asking for you specifically.You're responsible for bringing his fever down." He stepped closer,his threat unmistakable. "If anything happens to him, you'll be the first to pay-with a bullet."

Before Hannah could protest, Scorpio dragged her to Brixton's cabin.

Inside, Brixton lay on the bed, drenched in sweat, his face flushed with fever. Even in his delirium, his fingers rested near his waist, clutching at a weapon's outline.

Scorpio shoved her inside, shooting her a venomous glare before retreating.

Hannah muttered curses under her breath and then approached Brixton. She soaked a towel in cool water and pressed it to his forehead to ease his fever.

Deciding to leave him to rest, she moved to the door-only to find it locked. Damn it! Scorpio had locked the door.
###Chapter 558 Why Was She Here
"Damn it!" Hannah muttered under her breath, her foot slamming against the cabin door so hard that the frame quivered like a startled bird.

She spun around, stealing a guarded glance at the man stretched out on the bed. If Brixton really breathed his last,that madman Scorpio would pin the blame on her without blinking, and then her own goose would be cooked.

So, time and again, Hannah pressed the damp towel against Brixton's burning forehead, steady hands hiding her storm of unease.

Time limped forward until Brixton stirred. His eyes cracked open,immediately latching onto the fact that someone else was in the room. His gaze fastened on Hannah, perched tensely on the sofa.

As if by reflex, he lurched forward, his fingers clamping around her wrist like iron shackles. His fever-roughened voice rasped out,"Who let you in?"

Pain shot up her arm. Hannah gasped, twisting to break free,"Who else? Your oh-so-brilliant subordinate, Scorpio! Do you think I'd have the nerve to walk in uninvited?"

Brixton froze, shards of memory before his collapse flickering back. His grip slackened, only slightly.

Hannah snatched her hand back, rubbing the angry red mark,her lips tightening at the pain.

Brixton's eyes fell on the red mark on her wrist, and his brow furrowed unconsciously. How could this woman be so delicate?
furrowed unconsciously. How could this woman be so delicate?Just a touch, and the skin blossomed red.

He looked away, his voice still edged. "Why aren't you leaving?"

Hannah jabbed a finger toward the door, annoyance flaring."I want to leave, but your genius subordinate bolted it from the outside. Do you expect me to walk through walls?"

Brixton's frown deepened, apparently displeased with Scorpio's audacity. But at the moment, his mind was hazy with fever,and he lacked the energy to pursue the matter further.

He slumped back onto the bed, closed his eyes, and tried to sleep. But Hannah's very presence-her quiet breathing, her unmoving form-gnawed at him like sand in a wound.Discomfort welled up, sharp and relentless. His eyes flew open,irritation boiling over. "Can you stop making noise?"

Hannah blinked, caught off guard. "Noise? I haven't said a word.I haven't even moved."

Her calm defiance only stoked his fever-fed temper. He pushed himself upright, hand slipping beneath his pillow to draw a gun.

Hannah's heart leapt into her throat. What was he going to do?Would he really shoot her over a quarrel that wasn't even a quarrel? She fought to steady her breath. "Brixton, calm down!You're still burning with fever!"

His finger hovered taut on the trigger, chest heaving with rage he could neither contain nor release.

The moment stretched, a knife's edge between danger and restraint.Then, with a violent slam, he threw the gun onto the bedside table. He collapsed back onto the bed, turning his back to her, and growled, "Shut up! Go to sleep!"

Hannah rolled her eyes skyward, frustration bubbling over.What kind of lunatic had she been saddled with?
The night trudged on. The morning came.

At last, the rattle of a key outside shattered the silence. The door swung open, and Hannah slipped past Scorpio in a heartbeat,fleeing back to her cabin without a backward glance.

Inside, Brixton was already sitting upright, fever burned away,expression unreadable as he watched Hannah's hasty retreat.

"Mr. Ward, your fever's gone! Thank heavens-I was worried sick!" Scorpio blurted, his relief genuine.

Brixton's gaze cut to him, voice like frost. "Why was she here?"

Scorpio blinked. "Wait... Didn't you tell me to fetch her? Last night, half-delirious, you kept muttering you wanted her here."

His voice trailed as Brixton's expression darkened, shadows gathering across his features.

"When did I ever say that?" Brixton's tone was cold steel.

Scorpio's heart dropped. He bowed hastily. "I misunderstood!Forgive me, MAr. Ward. You should rest-I'll handle matters downstairs."

With that, Scorpio nearly bolted from the room.

Back in her own quarters, Hannah shut the door, locked it,and leaned against the wood, drawing long breaths to steady herself. She washed up quickly before heading to the kitchen,as though nothing had happened.

There, Hannah began preparing ingredients as usual,chatting lightly with the others, especially head chef Kayce Pearson."Mr. Ward just recovered from a fever. His appetite won't be strong, soI'll make porridge and a few lighter dishes."

Her statement was flawless. No one raised suspicion.

But midway,Hannah let out a loud gasp. "What in the world?

But midway, Hannah let out a loud gasp. "What in the world?How did these vegetables and this meat become so much less?"

All heads snapped toward her. An assistant cookand a servant hurried over, alarm rising.

"That's impossible!" Doug Holden, keeper of the stores, pushed forward,eyes widening at the sight of the noticeably emptier storage shelves. "I counted everything just yesterday afternoon -there was enough to last half a month!"

Hannah hid her sly smile behind a mask of worry and anxiety.The night before, she had sneaked down to the lower deck,hiding vegetables and meat in forgotten ventilation shafts and empty crates-meticulously staging a theft.

"What do we do now? If Mr. Ward discovers this, we'll be in for it!" Hannah cried, her display of fear perfectly timed, every look and gesture convincing.
###Chapter 559 Triggered Allergic Reaction


Kayce's brow tightened into a severe scowl, shadow darkening his features, though his tone stayed even."What's with the alarm? Just file the report the usual way. It isn't rare for supply logs to be off during long voyages. A tally might have been wrong, or certain perishables could've spoiled and been tossed out without anyone notingit."

He paused briefly, turning the matter over in his head. "I'll inform Mr. Ward later and request permission to dock nearby or arrange for a skiff to fetch what we need."

His eyes shifted to the young assistant cook at his side."As usual, Alfredo will come with me."

Hannah lifted her gaze slightly. Alfredo Clarke was Kayce's young kitchen aide. She had to find a way to prevent Alfredo from going.

Masking her thoughts, Hannah acted quickly while Kayce drafted the provisions list, setting to work on Brixton's meal.

Once she had wrapped up Brixton's meal, she deliberately did some cleaning, waiting until Kayce moved upstairs with the paper in hand. Then, she followed with the tray of food.

She timed it perfectly. As she reached the third deck, Kayce's voice drifted from the slightly ajar door of Brixton's cabin. "Mr. Ward, the vegetables and meat are used up faster than expected. Stocks are running thin-we'll need a resupply soon."

Brixton's tone edged with skepticism. "Already? We restocked not long ago."

Kayce answered exactly as Hannah had hoped, "Some vegetables may have spoiled from poor storage. And with all the extra tourists lately, usage has climbed higher than expected."

Uninterested in getting bogged down by such trivial details, Brixton brushed the matter off with a wave."Fine, see to it as you always do. Take a speedboat with a sailor and bring along a kitchen boy. Just be sure the list is complete."
"Understood," Kayce replied crisply.

"Dismissed."

Hannah stepped through the doorway at that moment, meal in hand, feigning perfect coincidonce.

She lowered her head, placed the tray gently on the table, and began to withdraw.

"Wait," Brixton commanded, his gaze locking on her, "Sit. Eat with me."

Hannah kept her eyes lowered. "My portion is in the kitchen."

"I said eat with me," Brixton repeated, this time with firm authority

"Alright." Hannah reluctantly sank into a chair.
Brixton hardly touched his plate, stopping after a few bites. His eyes drifted over her wrist, a faint crease forming on his brow. Then, with a trace of awkwardness, he muttered, "About last night... I'm sorry."

The words startled Hannah, leaving her almost doubting her ears. He actually offered an apology?

Before she could gather a response, Brixton pulled a small tube of ointment from his drawer and placed it in front of her, still stiff in his manner. "Use this."

Without another word, he stood and left the cabin.
Hannah stared at the ointment, confusion swirling, though her mind quickly slipped back to strategy. Her concern wasn't the ointment. Her concern was ensuring Alfredo never stepped off the ship with Kayce.

Then, an idea struck. Alfredo was still a boy-around fourteen, perhaps fifteen-with a weakness for treats.And it appeared that he was allergic to seafood.

A while later, in the kitchen on the lower deck, Hannah carefully baked a batch of seafood pastries. She casually placed them on the counter.

As expected, Alfredo soon wandered in, nose leading him. "Hannah, what's this? Smells incredible!" His mouth watered as he spoke.
Hannah smiled sweetly, sliding the plate toward him. "Freshly made. You can have one. The rest are reserved."

She had measured the portion carefully, enough to spark a mild allergic reaction, nothing life-threatening.

Alfredo beamed, snatched a piece, and devoured it eagerly, mumbling through his mouthful, "So good!"

But his delight faded fast. Moments later, itching consumed him, rashes spreading across his face and neck.He clawed at his skin, squirming.

"Alfredo! What's happening?" Hannah gasped in feigned alarm.

The ruckus drew Kayce at once. His expression turned grim when he saw the rash. His eyes flicked from the pastries to Hannah. "You gave him that?"

Hannah's voice carried innocent regret. "He can't eat seafood? I didn't know, Kayce..."

Kayce's brow furrowed deeply. "He's allegic to seafood! Alfredo, how many times must I tell you not to just eat anything?"

The rebuke ended with a glare at Alfredo.

Then, Kayce barked an order to a crewman nearby. "Keep him under close watch-don't let him scratch himself raw. I'll go for supplies immediately and pick up some allergy medicine for him!"

Hannah stepped forward quickly. "Kayce, Alfredo's condition is my fault. Let me take his place and go with you."

Kayce's eyes narrowed, incredulous. "Are you out of your mind? Do you think this is a game? Mr. Ward will never authorize you to leave. Since Alfredo can't go, I'll do it alone."

Hannah steeled herself. Even though she wasn't confident, she insisted, "Alfredo's reaction is my responsibility. I can't sit back and do nothing. I'll go request permission from Mr. Ward. Wait for me."

Before Kayce could respond, she spun and hurried upstairs, heart hammering, urgency drowning every other thought. She flung open Brixton's door. But what she saw inside chilled her blood to the marrow.
###Chapter 560 Secured Brixton's Consent


At the center of the room stood Brixton, with a lifeless body sprawled at his feet.

Smoke curled lazily from the muzzle of Brixton's gun, the metallic tang of gunpowder still clinging to the air.His expression remained flat, as though he'd simply crushed a bothersome insect.

No matter how many times Hannah saw Brixton take a life, she found herself unable to grow numb to the carnage.

At her sudden appearance, Brixton arched a brow and, unusually, offered a dry explanation. "He asked for death, and I simply granted his wish."

Forcing down a lump in her throat, Hannah steadied her features into a blank mask. More pressing matters at hand demanded her focus. Fighting to ignore the sharp bite of blood in the air, she let her words tumble out fast. "Could I go with Kayce to restock the supplies?"

Brixton calmly polished his weapon, not even glancing up."No."

"I swear | won't run-just trust me!" Hannah blurted, her voice tight with urgency. She lunged forward and grabbed Brixton's gun-wielding wrist.

She deliberately/ displayed panic and guilt as she rushed out the words. "I gave seafood to a kid by mistake -he's gone into a severe allergic reaction! There's no medicine on board, and if I don't do something, he might not make it... I can't just stand by and watch him die. Please, let me go get medicine."

Her breath hitched before she quickly offered a bargain. "Send Scorpio to watch over me if that puts your mind at ease! And-don't you love beef? I'll cook it for you every day once I'm back from the grocery shopping. Or tell me what you want-I'll make it. Anything."

Brixton's gaze shifted from her anxious face to the hand holding his wrist. Her touch was light, almost hesitant, yet it warmed his skin in a way that made him pause.

Hannah misinterpreted his reaction as displeasure and quickly let go of his wrist. To her surprise, Brixton let out a low chuckle, his dark gaze locking with hers. "This is the first time you've ever begged me. Tell me, is one small life really worth that much to you?"

"It means everything to me," Hannah declared without wavering.

A faint smile played on Brixton's lips as he stepped closer, his shadow falling over her. "And if one day, it's me lying on death's door, would you panic for me the same way?"

"Yes, I would," she answered without a beat of hesitation.

That seemed to please him, softening the edge of his expression. His mouth curved into a soft, dangerous smile. "Alright, go with Kayce then."

The next second, his expression cooled, voice dropping to a warning edge. "And don't entertain any thoughts you shouldn't while you're out there."

"You can trust me on this." Hannah tried to suppress the wild beating of her heart, ensuring her expression appeared sincere.

His tone lightened again, almost playful. "And when you get back, I expect that beef dish you promised."

Hannah finally broke into a genuine smile, her eyes sparkling. "Okay, wait for me!"

The brightness of her smile caught Brixton off guard, and he turned his head, as if it were too much to take in.Somehow, the words′′wait for me" kept replaying in his thoughts, gentle yet comforting.

Not long after she left, Scorpio stepped out of the shadows, brows knit. "Mr. Ward, are you really letting her leave like that?"

Brixton rubbed the spot where Hannah's hand had been, his voice flat. "Kayce's with her, isn't he? When he decides to be, he's far more ruthless than you. No matter how desperate she is to run, Kayce won't let her get far."

Scorpio pictured Kayce's brutal efficiency and gave a slow nod. "Fair point."

Meanwhile, after securing Brixton's consent, Hannah wasted no time tracking Kayce down. Kayce's brows rose at her news, a flicker of surprise crossing his face. "Didn't think you'd actually get Brixton to agree. Guess you really have a way with words."

Hannah dismissed the remark with a shake of her head, urgently asking, "When do we leave?"

"Now." Kayce didn't waste another second-he barked an order to a trusted sailor, and the three of them made for the speedboat hanging at the ship's edge.

Hannah fought to keep her pulse steady, her steps quick as she followed close behind.

They were on the verge of boarding the speedboat when, almost at the same moment, Vincent and his men boarded the Odin again.

The two groups passed within moments of each other-close enough that it felt like fate was holding its breath.
###Chapter 561 You Can't Escape


The speedboat slid into the harbor of a modest coastal settlement, its hull knocking gently against the wooden pier.

The sailor remained behind, stationed watchfully at the vessel, while Kayce guided Hannah along the stone-laid walkway that led up from the dock.

The little seaside town stretched in simple lines along the shore, its inhabitants dressed with unadorned plainness.

The first stop Kayce made was at a narrow-fronted pharmacy, where he purchased medicine intended to ease allergic reactions.

Hannah trailed a few steps after him, her eyes darting restlessly, marking the direction of alleyways and hidden turns. She forced her breathing steady,scanning for any opening that could grant her a chance to escape. Once they secured the medication for allergies, they continued to walk ahead.

Pausing deliberately before a vendor's stall stacked with bright fruits and crisp vegetables, Hannah plucked up a bunch of leafy greens, feigning fascination. "These look so fresh!" she declared with forced enthusiasm.

Kayce cast her an indifferent glance, grunted in response, and pressed onward without halting his stride.

Hannah's pulse thundered with nervous urgency. Her eyes followed Kayce's broad shoulders as he pushed into the gathering crowd, never once turning to confirm she remained behind him.

The moment had arrived. She tossed the bundle back upon the stall and slipped sideways into a narrow, shadowed passage, sprinting the other way with desperate speed. Her mind shrieked a single command, "Run!"

Yet, just as she rounded the next corner, heart leaping at the thought of freedom, she crashed straight into Kayce. "Planning to slip away?" His voice was unnervingly composed, smooth as still water.

Color drained from Hannah's face. Forcing herself into steadiness, she stepped back, shaking her head vehemently. "No, not at all! I only thought perhaps the vegetables were cheaper over there, so I wanted to compare."

Kayce's derisive snort cut through her excuse."Save your lies.You think I don't know Alfredo's allergy was your doing?"

Hannah's chest seized in startled panic, yet she shot back with heated denial, "That's not true!"

"Still denying?" Kayce's eyes hardened into steel."Seafood never runs short aboard, but in those patties you whipped up, the shrimp were scarcely present-yet somehow, just enough to spark his reaction. That wasn't chance. It was deliberate calculation." Hannah felt stripped bare, every defense crumbling,cold perspiration spreading across her spine. Her gaze flickered instinctively to a jagged stone lying near her feet, mind racing through the odds of seizing it and fighting her way free.

Kayce's sharp eyes caught her subtle eye movement,and he allowed her no chance. With sudden force, he brought his heel down upon the stone, shattering it into fine powder with a violent crack.

Hannah froze, horror widening her eyes, icy dread curling up her body. That strength-no human should possess it.

"You cannot flee," Kayce said evenly, withdrawing his foot as if the act meant nothing.

Cornered, Hannah shifted tactics. HHer eyes welled instantly, her voice trembling as she pleaded through tears, "Kayce, I beg you-let me go! I can pay you.Once I'm free, I'll transfer you more than enough to live in ease all your life."

A sardonic curl touched his lips. "Money? What is that supposed to be? It means nothing to me."

"Then what do you want? Power? Influence?Something else? If it lies within my reach, I'll secure it for you-just look the other way, please! Pretend you never saw me." Her desperation cracked through every word.

Kayce's head tilted slightly, pity glinting faintly beneath his stern expression. "And if I release you,do you think Brixton will spare me? He does not care how the task is carried out-only that it is finished.Losing you would seal my fate in death."

Hannah brushed her tears aside, regaining her composure. "So there's no path left? None at all?"

Kayce studied her sorrow in silence before his voice shifted unexpectedly. "Brixton hasn't treated you badly. In fact, he favors you above the rest. Why are you so bent on fleeing?"

Her reply rang with unyielding clarity. "Because I refuse to live under chains, tossed about with no control! I want to go home! I want to be with the one l love!"

"Home..." Kayce echoed, his eyes dimming with a faraway haze. Upon his battle-worn, indifferent features, a fleeting loneliness surfaced. "It's been years since I heard that word."

Sensing his vulnerability, Hannah's tone softened,almost coaxing. "Don't you long for home too?"

The moment shattered as his gaze hardened once more. "I have no such thing."

Silence fell between them.

After some time, Kayce shifted the conversation.
"You carry some compassion for Alfredo."

Hannah nodded with candor. "He's still a child, pure and kind. I couldn't harm him outright. But yes-l used him." She felt guilty toward Alfredo's allergic reactions.

Conflicted shadows crossed Kayce's face, as though he wrestled with a decision too heavy to speak aloud.Lowering his tone to a murmur only she could hear, he asked, "Do you truly crave escape that badly?"
Without hesitation, Hannah answered, "Yes."

His gaze drilled into her. "Then give me one promise.
If you break free, take another with you."

Her breath caught. "Who?"

"Alfredo."
###Chapter 562 Alfredo's Origins


Kayce's reply struck Hannah like a bolt from the blue.She gazed up at him, eyes wide with astonishment."Okay! But if I escape with Alfredo, what about you?Aren't you coming along? I can tell he leans on you,almost as though you were a father to him."

"A father?" Kayce's face twitched, the word cutting him like a knife. A pained smile bent his lips. "I've no right to that title. I assaulted Alfredo's mother, and that's how Alfredo came into this world."

Hannah's breath caught, her gaze riveted in disbelief.

Kayce seemed lost in painful memories as he continued, "In time, I grew attached to her. But fate played its cruel hand-she died before Alfredo's very eyes, there on that cruise ship. Since then, Alfredo's mind has remained frozen, trapped in the fragile years of fourteen. I begged Brixton to look the other way, to let Alfredo linger as an assistant in the kitchen.I thought-perhaps foolishly-that this small shelter of Alfredo might serve as my penance."
The remorse in his tone seemed bottomless. "But Alfredo can't stay there any longer. He has to leave."

The truth rattled Hannah to her core. She steadied herself before asking, "Why now? Because you saw I wanted to escape?"

"Partly," Kayce confessed, his expression suddenly grave. "But the greater danger is that Alfredo's secret is about to be unmasked."

"What would be unmasked?" Hannah asked,bewildered.

Kayce met her eyes head-on and dropped a revelation heavier than thunder. "Alfredo is actually a girl."

Hannah was rooted to the spot, stunned beyond measure. At once, she understood Kayce's urgency.On that ship, once Alfredo's real gender as a girl came to light, what awaited her would be a dark
future-condemnation to the iron cages on the second deck, doomed to exploitation and trafficking.

Drawing a deep breath, Hannah's eyes hardened with resolve. "I see. If I manage to escape, I'll find a way to take Alfredo with me."

Kayce read the fire in her gaze, and some of the tension in his own eased. "Thank you. I won't tell anyone about your escape attempt today. But you must return to that ship with me now. The escape demands patience and an elaborate plan-we'll wait for the next supply run."

"Alright." Hannah gave a firm nod. Breaking free by force was pointless; only a well-laid plan could hold water.

Kayce warned, "And no more tricks-like hiding food.Next time, Brixton's suspicions won't end with a frown."

"I understand." Casting a glance at the sky, Kayce urged, "Let's head
back."

But Hannah recalled Brixton's request. "We still haven't bought the beef. Brixton said he wanted it."

Kayce frowned, irritation crossing his face, yet he relented. "Then be quick. It's hard to navigate the sea after dark."

They hastened to purchase beef and a few other goods before returning to the speedboat, arms burdened with bags.

The sailor, impatient from the long wait, grumbled,"What took you so long?"

Kayce hurled the bags aboard, his voice cool and steady. "Brixton asked for beef-it wasn't easy to find."

The excuse rang sound enough. The sailor complained under his breath but pressed no further,starting the boat toward the Odin.

Meanwhile,aboard the Odin, Vincent and his men donned their disguises to alter their appearance and

played the part of wealthy buyers, prowling as though in search of something extraordinary.

Nate swaggered forward to deal with Scorpio, his voice edged with arrogance. "I hear you keep fine stock here-women, I mean. Yet, all I see are gambling dens."

A sly light flickered in Scorpio's eyes. At once, he masked it with a fawning smile. "Sir, of course, we have what you want. The price, however..." He rubbed his fingers together in the age-old gesture.

Vincent gave a subtle nod. Nate cracked open a briefcase, letting a glimpse of neatly stacked bills catch the light.

"This is only the deposit," Vincent declared,his will unshakable.

Scorpio's eyes gleamed at the sight, his tone turning honey-sweet. "Ah, a generous man! Please, come this way."

Scorpio led them down the stairs to the second deck. The sight that awaited made Vincent's chest tighten like a vice.

Cages lined the dim hall, each one holding women clad in tatters, their eyes hollow, stripped of hope.The grim tableau mirrored the horrors of the infamous Doreline Chemical Factory.

Vincent's pulse thundered. Terror warred with fury as he scoured the faces, dreading Hannah's among them. No...She wasn't there.

Relief washed through him, yet it carried no joy. Her absence meant only that she lay hidden elsewhere-perhaps in deeper peril.

Scorpio, ever watchful, tilted his head. "What is it,sir? None of these meet your taste?"

Vincent curbed the storm within, answering coldly "Don't you keep anything rarer?" His gaze flicked,seemingly unintentional, toward the stairway leading to the third deck.

And at that very moment, Brixton appeared at the top of the stairs.
###Chapter 563 She Is With Me


Brixton's piercing stare swept over the disguised Vincent and his crew from his position. Like a shard of winter, his voice sliced through the air. "The third deck's all men. There's no woman you're looking for."

Vincent assessed the situation, quickly concluding there was no reason for this man to lie.

Nate instantly played his part, plastering on a rueful look. "What a shame. My boss is picky-guess he's got nowhere to spend his cash tonight."

Vincent played along, shaking his head with mock disappointment before turning away. He led his men down the stairs.

For a moment, Vincent nearly let go of the hope gnawing at him. Maybe Hannah really wasn't here.

Then, just as he and his crew stepped onto the first deck and prepared to leave, Vincent's head tilted up. A speedboat glided toward the yacht, the night air thick with engine fumes. Several figures jumped ashore.

Vincent's stare locked in place. The person in the center walked with her head slightly bowed,a bag clutched close to her body. There was no mistaking that silhouette. It was Hannah.

A rush of wild elation tore through Vincent, nearly cracking the mask of calm he wore. His jaw locked hard as he fought the overwhelming urge to sprint forward and sweep Hannah away.

Thoughts raced through his mind, and in that moment, he made a bold decision. Pivoting sharply,he threw a searing glance at Hannah and deliberately let arrogance drip from his voice. "Hold it! This one looks interesting. I'll take her."

Vincent flicked a signal to Nate, who snapped open the case he carried, followed by the four trailing guards revealing neat stacks of crisp dollars.

"Five cases up front," Vincent announced with practiced swagger, his tone carrying an edge of command. "She's coming with me tonight."

Vincent's gaze locked on Hannah's, burning with a message he hoped she'd understand.

At first, Hannah failed to recognize Vincent-his beard and altered demeanor made him look like a stranger. Panic flashed through her, a rush of dread that she'd stumbled into even more danger. But then he spoke, and the sound of his voice pierced straight through her fear. Recognition hit like a lightning strike, nearly bringing tears to her eyes.

She dropped her gaze at once, digging her nails into her palm until it hurt, forcing herself to stay composed. Not here. Not now. If she so much as flinched, Brixton would notice-she couldn't risk it.

Scorpio gawked, stunned speechless by Vincent's grand gesture. His instinctive glance darted to Brixton for direction.

Brixton's expression had turned thunderous, his eyes carrying a dangerous edge. Moving deliberately down the steps, his presence radiated threat, his voice cuutting like ice. "She isn't for sale-no matter the price."

Determined not to falter, Vincent held Brixton's glare without flinching. "So what's the problem-money not enough for you?" He tossed the words out like bait, hoping cash would open a door.

"It's not about the money." Cold and precise,Brixton's voice cut through, each word clipped."She's with me."

Vincent's mouth curved into a cold smile. "Doesn't look that way from here." His gaze slid past Brixton,locking on Hannah with a deliberate spark of provocation. "Hey, gorgeous. How about you tell me yourself-want to walk out of here with me?"

Vincent closed the distance with a bold step forward.That was the last straw for Brixton.

A shot cracked through the air, the deafening sound ringing across the deck. The bullet clipped Vincent's armn before embedding in the planks at his feet.

With a furious snarl, Brixton snapped, "Back the hell off!"

Vincent reacted on instinct, yanking HHannah aside just as the shot went off.

Chaos erupted in an instant-bodyguards on both sides had their guns out, fingers tense on the triggers.

Taking advantage of the noise, Vincent bent close to Hannah, his breath brushing her ear. "I'll get you out of here," he murmured urgently.

Hannah's pulse pounded, but her mind stayed razor-sharp. "Not now," she whispered, barely moving her lips. "Did you notice what's happening on the second deck?"

"I saw," Vincent confirmed with a sharp nod.

"I can't just think about myself," Hannah said quickly,voice low but steady. "We need to get every woman off this ship. Now that you're here, I have confidence!"
###Chapter 564 Did That Man Kiss You


"This is too risky. My only priority is keeping you out of harm's way." Vincent's grip on Hannah's waist tightened, his heart aching with the urge to spirit her away from danger immediately.

"Trust me. I've come through unscathed, and I'm capable of ensuring my own safety." Hannah's eyes held steady, radiating determination. "I really want to rescue those women locked up in the second dock.Think of it as helping me, okay?"

Vincent gazed at Hannah, fully aware that her resolve was unshakable. His chest tightened with worry,but he ultimately chose to place his faith in her. Leaning close, he pressed a soft kiss to her lips. "Stay safe,please."

"Got it!" Hannah gave a resolute nod. In an instant,she gently pushed Vincent back. "Act like you're taking me hostage."
Vincent caught on immediately. His face hardened into a menacing scowl as he yanked her back into his embrace with a rough tug. With his arm clamped around her throat and a pistol pressed to her temple,he bellowed at Brixton, "Stay back, or she's done for!"

Brixton's expression darkened, his voice low and tense."Release her, and I'll let you walk away."

"She stays with us until we're on the boat." Vincent,keeping Hannah in his grip, inched toward the waiting motorboat, step by cautious step.

His crew covered their retreat, eyes sharp and weapons ready.

Brixton's men twitched, eager to act, but Brixton halted them with a raised hand.

When backing away, Vincent leaned in, his voice a hushed whisper in Hannah's ear. "I'm fighting every instinct to turn back, rally my team, and take those scum out right now so I can drag you to safety."

His squad was well-armed, more than capable of launching a fierce counterattack.Hannah whispered softly, "I know. I can feel how desperately you want to pull me out of this."

She paused and then continued, "When you showed up, it hit me-I'm not in this alone anymore. Knowing you're here, backing me up, washed away the fear and dread that has been choking me. I figure I won't have nightmares tonight, because you've got my back."

Her words soothed the raw edge of Vincent's anxiety, if only slightly.

"That's why," Hannah added, her voice steady and firm, "I need to keep my head clear, and you need to do the same even more. Ever since I learned that the women were held captives on the second dock,saving them has consumed my thoughts. With you here, I'm more confident and determined. I'm not just getting out of here-I'm bringing them all with me.But we need a solid plan. Rushing in recklessly could put them in greater danger."Vincent knew she was right. A head-on attack might secure Hannah's safety, but those women trapped in cages could end up as collateral damage in the chaos.

"Alright," Vincent finally said, his voice low and steady, regaining its usual calm resolve. "I'm with you. Wait for my signal. Keep yourself safe."

"You too."

With a gentle nudge, Vincent pushed Hannah toward the cruise ship's deck before leaping onto the motorboat. The engine roared to life, and the vessel sped off across the water.

Hannah stumbled onto the deck, caught by Brixton's quick hands.

Brixton's eyes scanned her carefully. "Are you hurt?"Hannah shook her head, avoiding his gaze. "I'm fine."His eyes narrowed as he noticed the faint redness around her eyes. "Why do you look like you've been crying?"He reached out, intending to touch the corner of her eye.

Hannah turned away, dodging his touch, her eyes lowered to mask her true feelings. "I was terrified."

It was a plausible excuse.

Brixton studied her, his gaze intense. After a long pause, he asked, "Did that man kiss you?"

Hannah's pulse quickened. He'd seen it! She met his eyes, her face flashing with a deliberate mix of anger and revulsion from being offended. She scrubbed at her lips with the back of her hand, as if erasing something vile. "He forced himself on me!"

Her voice trembled with a calculated blend of fear and relief. "Thank God you acted fast, or who knows what could've happened... I need to get the beef to the kitchen below before it spoils."

Without waiting for a response, she turned and hurried toward the stairs leading to the lower deck.

Brixton stood rooted in place, watching her

disappear, his face an unreadable mask. After a long moment, he turned to Scorpio, his voice cold as ice."Find Kayce. I need to speak with him."

"Right away, Mr. Ward!" Scorpio, sensing the storm in Brixton's mood, moved quickly to obey.
###Chapter 565 You Need To Prepare ItNow
Kayce arrived swiftly on the third-floor deck, his footsteps echoing against the wooden planks. "Mr.Ward,you called for me?" His posture straightened as he stood respectfully, head tilted downward in deference.

Silence stretched between them before Brixton finally spoke, his voice carrying an unsettling calm."When you went to purchase supplies today, did anything unusual happen along the way?"

Cold dread washed over Kayce. As expected, Brixton got suspicious.

Maintaining his composed facade, Kayce pretended to search his memory carefully before responding with measured hesitation, "Nothing major. Everything went pretty smoothly."He paused and added, as if suddenly remembering something, "Oh, right, there was a minor issue."

"Go on." Brixton's stare cut through him like steel.

"It was just that when we were buying groceries in town, which was bustling with people, I got separated from Hannah for a little while." Kayce's voice remained monotone, as if recounting the most mundane details. "Panic shot through me, thinking she might be trying to escape, so l quickly went back to look for her."

Pausing, he added, "However, I didn't have to search far before I spotted her returning on her own. She was carrying a bag of beef. She explained that the beef on the outside stalls didn't look fresh, and the best cuts were tucked away in the deeper corners, so she'd spent considerable time hunting for quality meat."

Kayce let bewilderment creep across his features. "I assumed she was being overly meticulous. Once stored on the ship, the beef will lose its freshness in a few days anyway. It really didn't seem worthspending so much effort finding the perfect cut.I assumed she was trying to escape, so my words came out harsher than intended. I'm not sure if I ended up scaring her."

His fabricated explanation attributed Hannah's brief disappearance to her search for fresher beef,seamlessly concealing the truth.

Just as Kayce had hoped, Brixton's attention shifted.Brixton asked, "She was really that selective about the beef?"

"Absolutely." Kayce nodded, allowing puzzlement to color his voice. "It struck me as odd. She seemed utterly committed to finding the finest quality."

Brixton fell into contemplative silence. Something utterly foreign and peculiar began stirring within him,quiet and insidious. Never before had anyone taken his offhand remarks to heart with such genuine earnestness. This sensation felt so alien that he found himself momentarily paralyzed, unsure how to respond.Brixton waved his hand dismissively, his tone softening slightly. "Very well, I understand the situation. You can go now."

"Yes, Mr. Ward." Kayce bowed with respect. Only when he'd descended the stairs could he finally release the breath he'd been holding, his shirt clinging to his sweat-soaked back.

As Kayce reached the first basement floor, he encountered Hannah, who was heading upstairs to rest. "Did you whip up the beef pasta?" he inquired.

Exhaustion was etched clearly across Hannah's features. "I didn't. I'm completely drained today.I'll prepare it tomorrow instead. Given all the chaos tonight, I doubt Brixton will have much of an appetite anyway."

Kayce's expression darkened instantly as he spoke with urgent intensity, his voice low. "Absolutely not!You need to prepare it right now and bring it to him immediately!"

Hannah stared at him in confusion."Why?""He's suspicious of you! He just summoned me upstairs and questioned whether anything unusual happened during our shopping trip today." Kayce's words tumbled out rapidly. "You don't fully understand Brixton's nature. Once he starts asking questions, you can never claim nothing happened, or it will only fuel his suspicions further."

Kayce continued, "So, following our backup plan,1told him I thought you were attempting to escape,but in reality, you had wandered off to find fresher beef. You absolutely must make the beef pasta now and bring it to him to support this story. If he asks,just tell him it's because you assumed he'd want to try it."

Understanding crashed over Hannah like a wave, her chest tightening as she nodded frantically. "I understand! How's Alfredo doing?"

"Much better after the medicine. He's resting peacefully. Don't worry about him right now. Start cooking!" Kayce urged, already moving toward the stove. "I'll help you."Hannah lifted the tray and climbed back up to the third-floor deck. When she knocked and entered Brixton's cabin, she found him standing by the window, staring pensively at the moonlit sea.

"This late in the evening. You actually made the beef pasta?" Brixton turned around, his gaze settling on the tray with what seemed like genuine surprise.

Hannah set the tray carefully on the table, managing a tentative smile as she repeated Kayce's coached response. "Yes, the beef is exceptionally fresh.It took considerable effort to locate the finest cut, and if left until morning, it won't taste nearly as good. The flavor would definitely deteriorate."

Brixton narrowed his gaze. Her explanation mirrored Kayce's account almost word for word. He offered no response, simply moving to the table and settling into his chair.

Hannah felt a wave of relief wash through her as shewhispered, "Please enjoy your meal. I'll return to my quarters now."

She was desperate to escape the suffocating atmosphere of the room.

Just as she reached the door and turned the handle,Brixton's voice stopped her cold. "Hold on a moment."
###Chapter 566 Starting To Develop Feelings For Her
Hannah paused, her heart skipped a beat. She wondered what Brixton was about to say-did he still harbor suspicions about her grocery run?

Drawing in a slow breath, Hannah turned and smoothed her expression, forcing calm into her voice."Was there something you wanted to tell me?"

Brixton didn't meet her eyes at first. He quietly scooped another bite of beef pasta and then finally spoke with deliberate slowness. "I was clearing my head when an interesting idea struck me."

Hannah tensed, wariness curling in her gut. "What is it?"
His gaze finally settled on her, sharp and unblinking."People say Vincent is madly in love with you, willing to pay any price to have you." A sardonic grin tugged 
 at his mouth while he spoke, slow and deliberate. "So tell me-why hasn't he tried to reach out and bargain with me, or even bothered to come searching for you after all these days?"

Hannah's laugh was laced with ice as she laid out the facts for him. "I'm your hostage. If anyone should make the first move, it's you. You should be the one sending him terms and a meeting point so he can come get me. How else could he possibly track me down in the middle of the sea?"

Deep down, she held onto the secret that Vincent already had. She pressed the thought firmly into the back of her mind and kept her expression unreadable.

A glint of malice danced in his smile as he added,twisting the moment deeper with every line, "Or maybe there's another explanation. Maybe Vincent doesn't value you half as much as you imagine.Maybe he's been busy enjoying someone else's company-why else hasn't he located you yet? Let's face it-men like him never have to lift a finger.Women practically line up to be at his feet."

His mouth curved into a cruel smirk. "Spending ten billion and giving up those treasures just to reclaim an old flame-maybe he's decided you're not worth the trouble."

Hannah's chest tightened with fury, though she swallowed it down, forcing herself to meet his gaze with composure. "What are you really getting at?"she asked, her voice steady despite the fire in her veins.

Brixton took two unhurried steps closer, his shadow falling over her as his eyes studied every line of her face. The question came so casually that it almost felt like a passing thought. "What about staying by my side for good?"

The words hit Hannah like a slap, leaving her stunned. Had she misheard? Was this man insane?Did he actually plan to keep his hostage as some twisted trophy? Or was he seriously starting to develop feelings for her? That'd be pathetic!She shut down the thought as soon as it surfaced.A man like Brixton, cold as stone, couldn't possibly grasp the idea of affection. To him, she was probably nothing more than an intriguing diversion, a prize he wasn't ready to relinquish.

Brixton's misreading of her silence made him uncharacteristically explain, his tone almost casual."Don't get the wrong idea. I just figured it might not be the worst thing to have a woman stick around for the long haul. You're the first woman who's-actually taken my offhand words seriously-tracking ddown the freshest beef for me. That's pretty interesting."

Hannah's lips curled in bitter amusement. Her frantic attempt at survival had somehow turned into a display of loyalty in his eyes. She shot back, her voice sharp as a whip, "Your subordinates also follow your every order-some would even kill if you told them to. In the end, isn't that just survival? What makes me any different?"

Besides, all of this was just part of her ruse to gain his trust to pull off her escape.Brixton didn't flare up at her jab; instead, a chuckle slipped past his lips, as though her defiance entertained him. "You've got a point," he mused lightly. "They take lives for me, so they get power and wealth in return. You make sure my meals are perfect-naturally, you stay close, and I'll give you privileges. I am good to the people who serve me-l don't screw them over."

His words carried a blunt, chillingly straightforward logic.

Hannah grasped that reasoning with Brixton was utterly useless; his logic was flawed. Choosing to keep her mouth shut, she sat perfectly still, aware that one wrong word might set him off.

To him, though, her silence felt like agreement, and his mood seemed to lift as if a trivial problem had just been solved.

Moving with deliberate ease, he pulled a phone from his pocket and dangled it carelessly. "This is the only device to reach Vincent." It was the only line of contact he routed through Erica whenever he wanted to pass along a message.

Without hesitation, Brixton flung the phone through the porthole, letting it vanish into the waves. Turning back with a lazy smile, he said lightly, "Well, that's it.Now, no one can find you now. You're stuck here forever."

The wind howled through the open porthole,whipping Hannah's hair and sending an icy shiver straight down her spine.

Hannah stayed quiet, her face unreadable, though inside her resolve hardened to steel, and a dangerous calm settled over her. "No. You've got it all wrong. Vincent has already found down," she sneered inwardly.

Afterwards, Brixton said nothing more. Hannah seized the moment, muttering a flimsy excuse before slipping away.

The following day, Brixton gathered all his core subordinates in the main hall on the third-floor deck.Low murmurs rippled through the crowd as everyone speculated about the reason for the sudden assembly.

Drawn by the noise, Hannah kept to the very edge of the gathering, shoulders tense, trying to remain unnoticed. A faint sense of dread gnawed at her.Whatever Brixton had planned, it couldn't be good.

At the front, Brixton lounged in an armchair, his long fingers drumming lazily against the armrest. When the last of his subordinates arrived, he rose slowly.

The hall fell silent, dozens of eyes fixed on him.

Brixton's lips curved faintly as he said, voice smooth and deliberate, "I've called you all here today for one reason-there's something you need to hear."
###Chapter 567 My Woman


The hall buzzed with a taut, unspoken tension.

Yet, Brixton made no move to speak right away. His eyes roamed over the gathering, assessing every face before finally stopping on Hannah, who lingered near the corner like she wanted to disappear. He lifted his hand, crooking a single finger, in her direction. "Hey, you-step over here."

Heads turned in unison, every gaze locking on Hannah.

The weight of their surprise, curiosity, and scrutiny felt like a thousand needles pricking Hannah's skin.Her chest tightened until it hurt. With so many eyes on her, refusing wasn't an option.

Hannah swallowed down the panic and smoothed her expression into something neutral before stepping forward, weaving through the narrow aisle that had opened for her like a gauntlet. The weight of every stare prickled across her back, setting her nerves on edge. Scorpio's eyes were as cold as a drawn blade.

Hannah halted in front of Brixton, lowering her gaze just slightly.

Brixton lifted his hand, gesturing lazily in her direction as his voice rolled through the hall. "From this moment, she's living on the third floor. She's no longer a hostage." A slow, satisfied curl touched his lips before he added, "She's my woman now."

The hall went still until Scorpio broke the silence, his jaw tight with fury. "Mr. Ward, please reconsider.If she's no longer our hostage, what happens to the deal we made with Vincent? Are we really giving up a billion in cash?"

Brixton didn't even glance up, his voice flat and cold."With what we've raked in from the casino and our current turnover, we've already cleared more than that. Why bother with Vincent's money?"

Scorpio's composure cracked. "But we're not after Vincent's money! What we want from him is...""Scorpio." Brixton's tone sliced through the room like a whip, his sharp look warning Scorpio to shut his mouth.

The color drained from Scorpio's face. He bit back the rest of his words, realizing how close he'd come to spilling everything. This was not the place for that discussion.

Hannah's stomach sank as the implication settled over her. Her suspicion proved correct-Brixton wasn't interested in Vincent's fortune at all. She couldn't stop herself from wondering what Brixton really wanted from Vincent. Possibilities raced through her mind one after another, leaving her unsettled.

Scorpio bit his lip, forcing down his agitation before speaking, trying to persuade Brixton using another angle. "Alright, let's set Vincent aside for the moment. Mr. Ward, I believe you're giving Hannah far too much weight. She's just an ordinary woman.Sure, she's attractive, but the world isn't short on beautiful women. I don't see why you prize her so highly.Are you actually thinking of marrying her?"

Brixton's icy stare pinned Scorpio in place, his presence alone enough to make the air heavy. "Did I give you permission to meddle in my affairs? Step back."

"Mr. Ward!" Scorpio's protest came sharp, almost pleading.

"| said step back." Brixton's words were quiet yet incisive, wielding a powerful authority that permitted no resistance.

Scorpio's chest rose and fell in quick bursts before he finally swallowed his anger, clamping his jaw shut.He shot Hannah a venomous glare and then reluctantly withdrew to the edge of the gathering.

Brixton's focus slid back to Hannah. He leaned forward, his shadow falling across her face, his tone deceptively calm. "Do you agree to be my woman?"

A bitter laugh threatened to escape Hannah's throat.As if she really had a choice. Brixton never cared for consent-only for power, for control, for the assurance that those around him would bow without question.

Brixton didn't really want to hear her answer. Before a single word left her lips, he straightened to his full height, his tone clipped and absolute. "You don't have to answer. Like it or not, on this yacht,you belong to me."

He turned toward the men gathered in the hall and made a dismissive wave. "That's all I havé to say.Clear out, all of you. If you have any objections,keep them to yourselves!"
The place fell utterly silent under the weight of his words. No one dared to challenge him. They traded looks before filing out of the hall one after another.

Hannah was almost at the doorway when Brixton's voice cut through the quiet, firm and cold. "Scorpio,stay."
###Chapter 568 Being Picked On


Hannah unmistakably caught Brixton calling for Scorpio. She lingered by the door for a moment,yet the voices within were little more than whispers,impossible to decipher. Not wishing to stir suspicion,she slipped away swiftly.

Upon reaching the corridor on the second deck, her path was suddenly barred by a cluster of women.They were the newly hired casino dealers on the cruise, led by a woman named Luna Hammond.

"Well, if it isn't Mr. Ward's favorite girl," Luna sneered, arms folded, her words soaked in mockery."Where are you off to? Why aren't you enjoying the luxury on the third deck?"

Hannah had no patience to engage with them. With a cool tone, she replied, "To the kitchen."

"The kitchen?" Tina Olson, another dealer, burst into exaggerated laughter. "You can't be serious!Overnight, you've become Mr. Ward's girl, and you still need to cook? Who are you trying to fool?"

"If I don't cook, will you?" Hannah halted, her gaze steady as stone.

Something in that look unsettled Luna, though she tried to hold her ground. "You do have a sharp tongue."

The other dealers snickered.

"Looks like her sharpness isn't confined to her tongue. I bet she's sharper in bed.How else could she climb so fast?"

"Exactly! With her appearance, she must have bewitched Mr. Ward. Who knows what spell she cast?"

Hannah gave a derisive laugh. "I once thought every woman who survived aboard this ship had at least half a wit. Seems I overestimated you. You're nothing but fools."

"You!" Luna's face burned crimson, fury choking herwords, "How dare you insult us? Girls, let's put her in her place! Let's show her who really ought to bow their head!"

The moment they began to close in, Hannah's eyes turned cold as winter steel. "The last group of dealers who forgot their place-they are gone. You should know their fates better than I do. Rumor has it they were thrown overboard as fish food. If you'd like to join them, by all means, test your luck."

The words froze the cluster of dealers in their tracks,a flicker of fear darting across their faces.

But Luna, more vicious than cautious, shrieked, "Do you think you scare us? We're the casino's most popular dealers. The casino needs us. Why would the casino risk losing us over you? Girls, she's bluffing.Don't hold back! Even if we don't kill her, scratching up her face will be enough. Let's see how she seduces Mr.Ward then!"

With that, Luna lunged forward, her long nails aimed like claws for Hannah's face.Hannah's gaze sharpened, and she moved like lightning, seizing Luna's wrist and landing a slap.

The sharp crack echoed through the air.

Luna's head snapped sideways, a glaring red mark blooming across her cheek.

The other dealers shrieked in shock and pounced ferociously.

Just as Hannah braced herself for a full-on fight, a petite figure darted out from the side. Throwing her arms wide in front of Hannah, she shouted at the dealers, "Stop! I've already told Scorpio, and he's on his way with people. If you want to keep your jobs and avoid punishment, you'd better scatter now-while you still can!"

At the mention of Scorpio, dread flashed across the dealers' faces. They exchanged uneasy glances,hesitation gnawing at them. In the end, none dared advance, though they hurled venomous glares at Hannah.After muttering threats like, "Just you wait,"they retreated quickly.When the corridor cleared, the petite ggirl exhaled with relief, clasped Hannah's hand, and whispered urgently, "Come on, let's go! I was bluffing-Scorpio knows nothing of this!"

Hannah caught on at once, gripping her hand in return. "Thanks. Follow me."

Instead of heading back to the third deck, Hannah led the petite girl down into the storage passage on the first deck, a place seldom visited by others.

"Thank you for what you did earlier," Hannah said sincerely. "My name's Hannah Scott. And yours?"

The girl gave a shy smile, eyes sparkling. "I'm Aanya Chadwick. I just couldn't stomach watching them bully you."

Hannah studied her, feeling a quiet stir within. After a pause, she offered, "You helped me, so let me return the favor. How about I cook you something? The kitchen's on the lower deck. I'm a fair hand with food."At once, Aanya's eyes lit with delight. "Really? That sounds wonderful! I'm a bit of a foodie, you know!"

Hannah chuckled softly and guided her toward the kitchen below.

At this hour, the place was nearly deserted.

With nimble hands, Hannah gathered ingredients and quickly whipped up a few snacks.

One bite, and Aanya's eyes went wide. "Wow, this is delicious!"

Watching Aanya enjoy the food, Hannah felt her vague intentions take shape. Allies-she needed them.More hands, more hearts that could stand with her on this ship. And Aanya, simple on the surface yet kind at heart, might just be someone worth winning over.
###Chapter 569 Trust No One


Hannah made a point of introducing Aanya to Kayce,who was bent over the counter arranging ingredients. "Kayce, meet Aanya-she's the one who helped me out just now."

Kayce lifted his head, his gaze pausing on Aanya for a beat before he gave a short nod. Without another word, he turned back to his task.

When Aanya was gone, the brightness on Hannah's face dimmed. She drifted closer to Kayce, taking up a plate and making a move to rinse it while she whispered, her voice hushed, "Brixton made it public that I was his woman, putting me in a hard position."

Kayce kept his voice quiet, his hands still moving."You should've seen it coming. A man like him keeps what he wants within reach. That only paints a bigger target on your back.""I know." Hannah's eyes flashed with determination."That's why we need to move faster. While cooking Brixton's meals and lending a hand in the casino,l can quietly figure out the weakest point-when the guards swap shifts on the second deck. I'll also look for a way to grab a spare key or find any blind spots in the surveillance cameras."

She hesitated, lowering her voice to a whisper."Alfredo has to be ready the moment we get an opening. As soon as the timing's right, we make a run for it."

Kayce stayed silent for several beats before finally asking, his tone low and wary, "Why the focus on the second deck? How does that connect to the escape?"
Hannah answered honestly, her voice steady, "I want to free those women being held on the second deck."

Kayce shot back, eyes wide, "Areyou out of your mind? You won't be able to get out."

Hannah didn't flinch. "I've already made contact withmy people. With their help, we have a real shot."

Kayce's knife froze mid-chop, and then he looked up sharply, suspicion flashing in his eyes. "When did you manage that? How exactly did you reach them? Can you even trust them?"

"Earned my total trust." Hannah met his gaze, her expression fierce. "His people are already on this ship."

Kayce's pupils narrowed, tension flickering across his face as he shot out a question. "They're already on this ship? How many of them, and what are they doing on board?"

His gaze darted instinctively toward the kitchen door,checking that no one was lurking nearby to eavesdrop.

"His people don't stay here full-time." Hannah clarified, her voice low but steady. "My contact was the same man from last time-the one who claimed he wanted to buy me. That was him."Recognition lit Kayce's eyes, quickly followed by a jolt of shock. "So it was him. But how did you manage to reach him?"

"When he staged that little charade of taking me away, we had just enough time to talk." Hannah's words tumbled out. "He told me that from that day forward, he'd send a different person every day-posing as gamblers-to slip aboard the ship and keep a one-way line of contact with me. They would carry this mark..."

She traced a quick, simple "L" across the wet countertop with her fingertip. "Anyone with this mark is one of ours. When I need to pass a message, I'll find a way to approach them."

Kayce's brows knitted as he thought it over and then said gravely, "It's a risky plan. This ship is crawling with spies, and Scorpio watches you more closely than anyone. And the idea of freeing the women on the second deck-it's too risky. A lost cause. I can't agree to it."

Hannah pressed her point, her voice quiet butinsistent. "Kayce, those women don't deserve this.And you wouldn't want Alfredo's fate to repeat,right?"

The words struck home. Kayce stilled, jaw tight, and then finally spoke. "The east corridor cameras on the second deck have been malfunctioning for days. No one's fixed them. Between two and two-thirty in the morning, the guards are at their sloppiest-it's peak gambling time. As for the key..." His gaze hardened."I'll find a way."

"Thanks, Kayce." Hannah gave a solemn nod and added, "That girl Aanya from earlier-she seems a bit naive. Maybe she could pass along minor intel without even realizing its importance. If we're going to pull the escape off, we need every pair of eyes and ears we can get-even the unsuspecting ones."

Kayce didn't answer right away, but his dark eyes held hers with unsettling intensity. "Here's the fundamental rule for surviving on this ship-trust no one." He let the words hang before adding,voice flat and merciless, "Not even me."A cold weight settled in Hannah's chest.

Kayce continued, his tone sharp as a blade, "I'm only helping you because I want Alfredo out of this nightmare. But if it ever comes down to saving you or saving Alfredo, I won't hesitate to trade you for his life."

Hannah held his gaze. "So, are you going to betray me?"

Kayce answered without a moment's hesitation, "I want Alfredo to get out safely."

It wasn't a straight answer, but its underlying messages were clear.Alfredo was the only line Kayce refused to cross, the center of every decision he made. As long as Alfredo stayed safe, Kayce might keep his word-but if Alfredo's life was ever threatened, he would sacrifice Hannah without a second thought.

Hannah stayed quiet for a beat before giving a small nod. "I get it." The bluntness of the deal,the clear lines he had drawn, felt more real to her than anycomforting lie.

After a pause, Kayce's expression shifted, as if something had just come to mind. He lowered his voice and changed the topic. "In a few days,the casino onboard will close for a day."

Hannah's brows lifted. "Close? The daily turnover here can reach millions of dollars. What could be more important than making money?"
###Chapter 570 Over Something So Insignificant
"A banquet for important guests," Kayce explained with measured precision. "It's about carving up the spoils.Tell me-does that sound important enough?"

When fortunes shifted hands, astronomical sums flowed like rivers, and those treacherous waters bred the fiercest conflicts.

Hannah's pulse quickened as understanding crystallized. "For a banquet of this caliber, Brixton needs a woman at his side, doesn't he? Just to project power and social standing."

Kayce's stare on her intensified, shadows flickering behind his eyes. "No woman has ever graced his side at formal gatherings. You've broken unprecedented ground as his acknowledged companion."

A harsh laugh escaped Hannah's throat. "Strange how you make it sound like some coveted prize."

"I'm delivering cold reality." Kayce's words cut like winter wind. "An unsolicited advice? Don't let the illusion of being Brixton's chosen one cloud your judgment. His world revolves around profit margins;women exist as ornaments or instruments."

"I understand." Hannah's voice rang with steely resolve. "From the moment I was dragged aboard this floating prison, my goal never wavered.Freedom. Complete escape back to the life stolen from me. Everything happening here, including Brixton's so-called privileges, boils down to calculated survival, not romance."

Something shifted in Kayce's expression as he regarded her. "You're nothing like the other women trapped on this vessel."

Hannah's head tilted with philosophical calm. "That comparison isn't fair, Kayce. Circumstances shape survival strategies. What you might judge as weakness represents their best attempt at staying alive." Luna's face materialized in her thoughts. "TakeLuna-she understands exactly what she needs.Protection from powerful men. Her mistake was targeting the wrong rival with clumsy tactics."

Surprise flickered across Kayce's features. "No bitterness toward her for giving you trouble?"

"None whatsoever." Hannah's tone held unwavering certainty. "We're just in different positions." Her eyes suddenly sharpened with suspicion. "Wait-how do you know Luna gave me trouble?"

Meaningful intensity danced across Kayce's face as his hands worked the ingredients with fluid precision."Information flows freely on this ship when you know the right channels."

Cold dread prickled Hannah's skin, though her thoughts remained fixed on the approaching "money-splitting" banquet. Her mind churned through possibilities-would Brixton demand her presence? Even without the companion role, he might insist she handle the banquet preparations as his "personal chef."  Those gatherings where interests got divided always turned volatile when someone felt shortchanged. If tensions exploded into open conflict, she could fan those flames into full chaos. During that mayhem,she and her allies might finally break free with every woman imprisoned on the second deck.

The days that followed saw Hannah and Aanya's relationship blossom into something unexpectedly deep.

Aanya's apparently pure spirit, fearless loyálty, and protective instincts stirred feelings Hannah thought she'd buried forever.

Several times,when Aanya threw herself into harm's way to confront those troublesome dealers,Hannah's heart nearly cracked open enough to spill her secrets. But each time, at that crucial moment,Kayce's arctic warning sliced through her thoughts -"Trust no one, not even me."

In the end, Hannah said nothing, instead showering Aanya with increased affection while shielding her more fiercely from Luna's vindictive circle. Out of this protective instinct and to spend more time with Aanya, Hannah summoned her nerve to face Brixton. "Could Aanya possibly join me in the kitchen? She'd help prepare your meals. She has quick hands and is quite attentive."

This marked Hannah's first plea since being branded Brixton's possession.

Brixton lounged back, fingers drumming a lazy rhythm against polished wood while his predatory gaze dissected Hannah's expression. Eventually,calculating that having his own spy monitor her movements might prove useful, he casually nodded with a faint smile."Sure."

Hannah's breath caught before pure elation transformed her features. "Truly? Thank you!"

She swept Aanya into a fierce embrace.

Aanya squeezed back with bubbling excitement.
"Thank you,Hannah!"

Brixton found himself studying Hannah's radiant expression, something shifting behind his eyes.Rarely had he witnessed her unguarded like this-no forced calm or strategic obedience, just raw,unfiltered happiness. And just over something so insignificant? His voice cut through their excitement."This small thing makes you glow like that?"

Hannah reined in her smile slightly, though her eyes and expression still sparkled with residual joy. "Yes,thank you."

Brixton studied her face, and then his voice dropped to something more possessive. "No need to thank me. Since you're already my woman, you can ask me for anything."

His words dangled like bait, yet the underlying threat of ownership made her skin crawl.

Hannah felt ice creep up her spine and refused to take that conversation further, simply dropping her gaze. "If there's nothing else, I'll go prepare dinner."

"Wait!" Brixton's command stopped her mid-step."I'm not in a good mood. Tell me a joke to lift my spirits."

Hannah widened her eyes in surprise. How could he possibly feel sour? Didn't he just laugh a moment ago?
###Chapter 571 True Colors Revealed


Hannah's mind reeled, scarcely able to process the words she just heard. For a fleeting instant, she questioned if Brixton genuinely wanted her to amuse him with jokes of all things. Her back stiffened as she answered in clipped tones, "I don't know any jokes."

An uncomfortable silence fell, thick and immediate,like a veil draped over the room.

It was then that Aanya, who had been quietly tucked away to the side, broke through the silence with hesitant courage. "Mr. Ward, I know some jokes.Would you like to hear one?"

Brixton shifted his attention toward her, his eyes narrowing with the faintest glimmer of interest,a subtle nod granting permission.

Without delay, Aanya offered a joke. It wasn't sharp or particularly witty, yet the way she delivered it brimmed with energy and girlish charm. Hannah let out a burst of laughter, partly to soften the tension in the air, and partly because Aanya's earnest attempt genuinely struck her as amusing.

Brixton's gaze lingered upon Hannah's profile,studying her laughter with an unreadable calm. His lips curved faintly as he remarked, "You seem to have attracted a rather entertaining follower."

Hannah inclined her head in acknowledgment,gently taking Aanya's hand. "Aanya is delightful. We'll be heading down now."

At Brixton's comment, a flush of red spread across Aanya's cheeks. She glanced back at him, her eyes filled with fascination, even as Hannah tugged her along.

Once outside Brixton's cabin, Aanya could barely contain her excitement. She whispered with trembling glee, "Hannah, did you see? Mr. Ward's smile-it's so handsome!"

Hannah thought back to Brixton's expression,answering with honesty, "Is that so? To me, he only
stirs unease. Whenever I look at him, fear follows."

But Aanya, dreamy-eyed, cupped her cheeks with both hands and breathed out as though lost in a fantasy, "No... He's so handsome. I love watching handsome men!"

Then, almost as if struck by inspiration, she added quickly, "And pretty women too. You're the prettiest,Hannah! Could I join you tomorrow to bring Mr.Ward his meals?"

"Of course," Hannah agreed warmly, though she couldn't help but notice that Aanya's enthusiasm for Brixton bordered on obsession. Still, she reasoned it wasn't strange. A young girl could easily be captivated by a man as commanding and striking as Brixton. She chose not to dwell on it.

From that day onward, Aanya gradually became the one engaging with Brixton during each meal delivery.She always had some lively tale to share, some trivial yet entertaining detail from life on the ship, coaxing faint smiles from Brixton more often than not.


Meanwhile,Hannah found unexpected peace in retreating to the background, speaking only when Brixton addressed her.

Watching Aanya's joy bloom brighter with each exchange, Hannah's unsettled feelings were momentarily quieted. She even thought the situation worked to her advantage. Perhaps if Brixton's interest shifted, her chances of slipping away might improve.

That evening, Aanya approached Hannah, claiming there was a leak in the bathroom and urging her to come inspect it.

Hannah, trusting Aanya without hesitation, followed her inside.

The instant they crossed the threshold, the door slammed shut behind them.

Before Hannah could react, several women surged forward from either side, their hands gripping her arms with merciless force. They dragged her down,forcing her knees against the cold tiles. Pain shot through Hannah's legs, and she winced,struggling to lift her head-only to see Luna standing there, arms folded, eyes brimming with disdain.

"Pathetic," Luna sneered, her voice dripping with contempt. "Did you really believe anyone here truly cared for you? It was nothing but an act."

Aanya slowly emerged from behind Luna, stepping in front of Hannah. Gone was her innocent demeanor;in its place rested a cruel mask. Her head tilted slightly, a sweet smile playing on her lips while her tone rang icy. "Hello, Hannah."

The truth struck Hannah like a blow. Everything fell into place. But instead of breaking, she summoned her composure, choosing not to fight with skills honed from her martial training. Her gaze hardened on Aanya as she said evenly, "So, you're with them."

"Exactly!" Aanya's laughter was bright with cruelty."Every kindness I showed you was nothing but a show. I just wanted to get close to you. My dear friends had performed their roles wonderfully to echo my acting." "You're after Brixton?" Hannah pressed, her voice slicing straight to the heart of it.

Aanya didn't bother to deny it. "Yes! I went to great lengths and gave up so much just to step onto this yacht for him! But before I could reach him, you appeared, taking the place that should have been mine!" Bitterness edged her tone, though smugness soon followed. "Still, I ought to thank you. You were so trusting, so foolishly kind. You drew me closer to Brixton-let me tell him jokes and chat with him."

She leaned closer, her voice dripping with malice."And it made me see clearly. He doesn't truly value you,does he? He enjoys my company more, doesn't he? Perhaps soon, he won't want you around anymore. Just having me is enough for him. Don't you think?"

Hannah studied Aanya's arrogant face and then said,"Come closer."

Believing Hannah had finally yielded-or that she might reveal a desperate secret-Aanya leaned down, smug triumph glinting in her eyes, her earnearing Hannah's lips.

But in the next heartbeat, Hannah summoned every ounce of strength and spat straight onto Aanya's face.
###Chapter 572 Nothing But A Helpless Captive


Shock paralyzed Aanya's entire body. Heat flooded her cheeks as humiliation and fury twisted her delicate features. Her palm flew upward before cracking across Hánnah's face with vicious intent.

Hannah could have easily deflected the strike with her trained reflexes or delivered a crushing counter-blow, yet she remained perfectly still. The slap connected with her cheek, sharp and stinging.Every second had been calculated.

"You're nothing but a helpless captive!" Aanya hissed, flexing her burning fingers with savage satisfaction. "A prisoner with no escape still dares to be arrogant! Starting today, you'll waste away in this forgotten bathroom. Management marked it broken months ago, so no soul will venture here. Eventually,you'll decay in complete isolation, forgotten and

rotting."

Smugness dripped from every word as her eyes gleamed with anticipation. "Meanwhile,I will take your place, becoming Brixton's one and only woman!"

Luna and the other dealers swarmed around Aanya instantly, pouring out honeyed praise, desperate to curry favor.

Only Hannah kept her gaze lowered, releasing a soft,mocking chuckle.

"What's so amusing?" Aanya's voice turned razor-sharp.

Hannah's head lifted slowly. "I'm laughing at you, for not understanding Brixton at all. With that pathetic act and shallow mind of yours, I doubt you'd even last half a day in front of him."

Aanya's voice climbed to a shriek. "Who exactly are you trying to intimidate? I've seen through your tricks to get close to Brixton these past few days. Nothing

but blind obedience, sugary whispers, and cooking his favorite dishes, all to scheme your way into his bed. Everything you do, I can execute flawlessly!"

"Scheming into his bed?" Hannah's laugh held pure disdain. "You think it's that simple? Your naivety really astonishes me. What kind of man do you think Brixton truly is? Do you honestly believe he lacks women throwing themselves at him? I was being generous when I said half a day-a self-righteous fool like you would be lucky to last two hours around him. Surviving even that long in his company would qualify as miraculous."

"Shut the fuck up!" Aanya barked, her face burning with embarrassment and rage. "You're merely a trapped prisoner awaiting death in this place. Speak all you wish! Continue your delusions. We're leaving!"

Aanya refused to hear another word from Hannah and commanded Luna and the others, "Seal this place tight. Nobody releases her without my explicit authorization!"

Luna and her companions nodded eagerly, trailing

<behind Aanya as she marched out of the bathroom with triumphant steps, securing the heavy door from outside.

Silence settled as their footsteps disappeared down the corridor,leaving Hannah completely alone.

Hannah rose gracefully, massaging her throbbing cheek while a calculating glint of victory sparked in her dark eyes. Those dealers were utterly foolish,rushing headlong into danger without knowing that this bathroom, marked as damaged, concealed a secret known only to veteran crew members.

Behind an ordinary wall tile lay a cramped passageway connecting to a forgotten storage room next door. Kayce had shared this detail during their discussions about the ship's hidden blueprint.

Her decision to avoid using combat skills earlier,even deliberately baiting Aanya into delivering that stinging slap, had been purely strategic theater.Every humiliating moment served to make this imprisonment appear more convincing, setting the stage for her eventual vanishing.

This entire plan had crystallized the moment she'd discovered Aanya's true intentions. Since Aanya desperately wanted her position, she would exploit this opportunity to finally escape this floating prison.

Hannah slipped into the abandoned storage room.While she was relatively secure, time remained her enemy.She needed to send a message quickly.

Tearing fabric from her shirt, she pierced her fingertip with her teeth and scrawled urgent words in crimson, racing against precious seconds. "Monitor the ship's course closely over the coming days.I might be dumped at sea. Rescue urgently needed."

This desperate plea was meant for Vincent's network within the casino.

While Hannah doubted her value to Brixton, she understood her current status as his claimed property. Should she go missing, he would undoubtedly launch a search. Anticipating suspicion,Aanya and her accomplices would likely eliminate all evidence, with the sea providing the most convenient disposal method under cover of darkness. If Vincent's operatives maintained vigilant surveillance of the waters and intervened swiftly, her chances of survival remained viable.

Hannah folded the bloodstained fabric with meticulous care before sliding it into her sleeve. Her moving freely through the casino would immediately attract unwanted attention, particularly from Luna and her fellow dealers, so she placed her trust in Kayce's assistance.

Kayce executed the message delivery with flawless efficiency.

Now, she just had to wait.

Meanwhile, within Brixton's luxurious cabin on the third deck, Scorpio delivered his report in hushed tones, "Mr. Ward, following your orders, we've established contact with Vincent."

Brixton reclined in his leather chair wvith casual authority. "Has the delivery been completed?"

"Successfully," Scorpio confirmed with a sharp nod.


"We located a woman matching Hannah's physical description and hair color, disfigured her face, and then arranged the scene to suggest death during violent struggle. Our operatives have presented the body to Vincent."

This elaborate deception had been orchestrated immediately after Brixton's public declaration of Hannah as his woman. The fabricated corpse would terminate Vincent's relentless search while simultaneously providing valuable negotiating leverage...

Brixton's expression remained utterly unreadable."Did he believe it?"
###Chapter 573 Only Want Dishes FromHannah
A flicker of thought crossed Scorpio's eyes before he finally said, "It's hard to say whether Vincent believed that corpse was Hannah. He's unpredictable. Still, he got back to us." He leaned closer, lowering his voice. "He wants to meet with you personally,Mr.Ward."

A dangerous spark lit up in Brixton's gaze, cold and calculated. "Good. A face-to-face is long overdue.
Time to settle this." His tone hardened, carrying an icy edge. "Don't take your eyes off Hannah-not for a second. I won't tolerate any mistakes while I'm dealing with Vincent. And above all-don't let them meet."

"Understood!" Scorpio straightened, determined."I'll double the men guarding her."

Brixton's gaze drifted toward the window, catching

the deepening night sky. His brows drew together as he queried, "It's already dark. Why on earth hasn't Hannah brought dinner?"

Normally speaking, by this time, Hannah would have already appeared with the evening meal.

Scorpio froze for a beat before replying, "I'll check it out right now."

Before he could move, a soft knock echoed at the door.

Scorpio pulled it open to find Aanya standing there,balancing a tray in her hands.

A shadow crossed Scorpio's face as his brows drew together in a frown. "Why is it you? Where's Hannah?"

Stepping inside with quiet composure, Aanya set the tray down and spoke gently to Brixton. "Mr. Ward,Hannah suddenly felt sick. It seemed she had eaten something that upset her stomach, and she is resting in her room now. She insisted | bring your dinner

 instead."

Brixton's gaze fixed sharply on her. "She's sick?"

"That's right," Aanya replied calmly. "But it doesn't seem serious. A bit of rest should do the trick. Go on and have your dinner, Mr. Ward. It's at its best while it's still hot."

Brixton only flickered his hand in a dismissive gesture. "Just leave it right there."

"Of course." Aanya stepped forward and carefully set the tray on the table, but her feet lingered. She stole a quick look at his face and then drew a steadying breath. "Mr. Ward, would you like to hear a joke before dinner? Something to lighten the mood?"

Brixton's voice came out low and firm. "No need.Without Hannah, what's the point of jokes?"

He wanted laughter-Hannah's laughter-because it softened the edges of his world.
Picking up his fork, he tasted the first bite. His brows knitted instantly, and he spat the food back onto the


plate with visible irritation. "Hannah didn't cook this,did she?"

Aanya's stomach dropped, her polite smile faltering as she rushed to explain, "She wasn't feeling well tonight, so I prepared the meal myself. Is it not to your liking? Please-tell me what's wrong, and I'II make it right next time."

Brixton set his utensils down with a sharp clink, his icy gaze cutting across Aanya like a blade. "This is terrible. From now on, HHannah handles every meal of mine. If anyone else cooks, don't bother bringing it to me."

The command landed like a verdict, final and merciless. Aanya's face drained of color, resentment and hurt twisting in her chest. She hesitated before daring to protest, her voice almost pleading, "Is my cooking really so different from Hannah's, Mr.Ward?If there's something wrong, tell me-I can learn and improve."

A chill settled over Brixton's face, wiping away every trace of warmth. "Did you not understand what l

said?"

Aanya flinched, her shoulders curling inward. "N-no, I understand! I'll go right now!"

She turned on her heel, fleeing the room as if the very air had turned to ice.

Scorpio stood off to the side,his voice carrying a hint of warning. "Mr. Ward, Aanya's been acting bolder around you lately-reckless, even."

Brixton let out a cold, dismissive snort, offering no comment on this. Instead, he cut straight to business. "Why haven't you handled the task?"

His tone made it clear he meant checking on Hannah and delivering the medicine.

Scorpio faltered, momentarily taken aback by Brixton's sudden concern for Hannah's condition.After a pause, he couldn't help but speak up. "Since you care that much about Ms. Scott, why not go see her yourself?"

The words had barely left his mouth when Brixton's icy glare pinned him in place. "Seems you're growing bold as well."

A chill ran down Scorpio's spine. Realizing his slip, he quickly bowed. "Forgive me, I crossed the line-1'take care of it immediately!"

Without waiting for a response, Scorpio turned and hurried out.

Scorpio worked fast and came back with a grim look."Mr. Ward, there's a problem. I went to Ms, Scott's room-it's empty! She was supposed to be resting,wasn't she? She's vanished without a trace. I've checked with everyone-no one's laid eyes on her.Could she have taken the chance to slip away?"

The moment the words landed, a storm cloud swept across Brixton's face. He strode quickly toward Hannah's room. Left wide open, the doorway offered a view of the silent, empty space beyond.

Brixton's first thought was the same as Scorpio's.She had escaped! The seemingly meek and obedient woman had found the opportunity to run away.
###Chapter 574 Find Her


Brixton's expression turned thunderous as he barked out his orders, "Spread the word-find Hannah now!Lock down every exit and search the entire ship. Tear the place apart if you have to. There's no fucking way Hannah just disappeared into thin air in a place this small!"

"On it!" Scorpio snapped to attention and sprinted off, his team scattering like startled birds.

The hallway erupted with pounding footsteps and sharp voices as the frantic search spread through the ship.

Inside her hiding place, Hannah froze, pulse racing.The sudden chaos outside told her Brixton had discovered she was missing. She strained her ears,catching every distant shout and heavy bootstep.

Muffled steps broke the silence, frantic yet careful,closing in on the bathroom door like a storm in slow

motion.

A sudden shove sent the door swinging open in one swift motion.

Aanya rushed in with Luna and several other dealers,faces taut with urgency as they scanned the room.

Pretending to be startled, Hannah let out a shaky cry."W-what do you want?"

Aanya's gaze gleamed with cold malice. "Brixton has noticed you're missing. If he finds you now, we're finished.So there's only one way to keep this from blowing up-we make sure you vanish."

The women lunged, seizing Hannah by the arms with bruising force.

Hannah gave a convincing struggle, thrashing just enough to look desperate, her voice breaking as if in fear,while letting them drag her toward the porthole.

Aanya's lip curled as she snarled, "Don't look at me like that! I hadn't wanted to end you like this. Then again, blame yourself for getting in my way."

With a final, savage push, Aanya and Luna sent Hannah tumbling through the gaping porthole.

A sharp splash followed. The black sea swallowed Hannah instantly, the icy water clawing her downward.

As the current wrapped her tight, Hannah welcomed it with a sharp, silent satisfaction. Her plan pulled off.Now all that mattered was whether Vincent could reach her before it was too late.

Her body fought to stay awake, limbs thrashing weakly as she tried to claw her way to the surface.

Just when the last of her strength seemed ready to give out and the waves threatened to pull her under,a blinding beam of light cut across the water.

A sleek speedboat roared closer, slicing through the dark waves.

"There-she's there,go!"

That voice-she knew it. It was none other than Vincent.


Strong hands hauled her out of the freezing sea.A thick blanket cocooned her shivering body, but her eyelids refused to stay open. The world tilted and slipped into darkness.

Hannah had no idea how much time passed before her senses slowly returned. Her lashes fluttered,and she stirred, every muscle sore and heavy, her body still trembling with exhaustion.

Vincent, who had stayed glued to her side the entire time, instantly noticed her stirring and caught her hand, his voice hoarse with breathless relief, the edge of panic not yet gone. "Finally, you're awake.Are you alright?"

Seeing the worry in his eyes made Hannah's chest ache, and she gripped his hand with all the strength she could muster.

Without another word, Vincent wrapped her against him, holding her so tightly that it was as if he wanted to fuse her to his chest and never let go.

For a long moment, they clung to each other, hearts pounding, their relief and love after such a narrow escape magnified until it nearly hurt.

Only when their breathing had steadied did Vincent ease back. He carefully offered her a cup of water,waiting until she'd taken a few sips before speaking his expression grave. "I got the message you sent.Thank God I made it in time. How did you end up overboard?"

Hannah recounted everything that happened with Aanya, her voice still faint. Vincent's jaw tensed, his brows drawn in a fierce line. "You were far too reckless. What if I hadn't gotten there in time? Were you ready to just gamble with your life like that?"

The thought of how desperate she surely was mnade his voice rougher, the image clearly haunting him.

Hannah squeezed his hand gently, her voice soft but steady. "But I'm right here, aren't I? You found me in time."

After a pause, Vincent exhaled and shifted to the real reason he'd come. "Brixton sent me something a

while back."

Her brows drew together as she inquired, "What did he send?"

His expression hardened, eyes like steel. "A corpse-burned beyond recognition. He wanted me to think it was you."

A sharp pang clenched Hannah's chest, stealing her breath for a moment. "And you..."

"Of course, I didn't fall for it," Vincent cut in, his tone resolute. "But I played along. I set up a meeting and let him pick the time and place."

Her eyes widened as she caught on. "You're going to use that meeting as cover-to free those women on the second deck and get them off the yacht,aren't you?"

"That's right!" Vincent gave a firm nod. "This is the best shot we've got. Brixton's focus will be locked on the meeting, and most of his men will be tied up there. That should leave gaps in their security that

 we can exploit."

Hannah leaned forward, her voice quick and urgent."Kayce mentioned that in a few days, the Odin will shut down the casino for a private banquet-some big profit-sharing event. When that much money's involved, it's only a matter of time before conflicts occur. If we can stoke the flame and throw them into chaos, we'll have the perfect chance to extract those women."

Vincent's jaw tightened as heabsorbed every word,his eyes shadowed with worry. With a firm grip on her shoulders, he delivered his words with grave seriousness. "Anna, I'll plan this rescue down to the last detail and throw everything I have into it. But you, you're not going anywhere. Don't set foot outside this room, or I'll have someone send you straight back to Dorbarrow. I've already lost you once. With the Odin this dangerous, I won't gamble on losing you a second time."

Hannah's resolve didn't waver. She shook her head,her eyes clear. "No. I won't stay in this room. I have


to return to the Odin."

A crease formed between Vincent's brows,frustration and concern warring in his expression."That place is too dangerous. Just listen to me."

"I know the risk." She caught his hand and held it tight. "But I gave my word. I promised those women I'd help, and I swore to Kayce I'd get Alfredo out. I've seen what they are going through down there. Now that I have a real chance to help them, I can't turn my back on it. If I do, I'll never forgive myself."
###Chapter 575 Make Her Suffer Beyond Imagination
"But your safety is what matters most," Vincent insisted with raw desperation, his fingers digging into Hannah's shoulders as his eyes burned with pleading firmness."Please. Just this once, listen to me."

"No." Hannah's voice sliced through the tension like steel. "I can't just abandon those women and Alfredo."

The two faced each other in deadly silence, neither willing to bend.

Vincent stared into her blazing eyes, his jaw clenching as he realized no force on earth could sway her. A shuddering breath escaped him before he crushed her against his chest. "Fine, I'll agree to it. But you have to promise me-no matter what,you must protect yourself! Your safety comes first.Always!"
"I promise you!" Hannah melted into his embrace as she sealed the vow.

Vincent's throat worked against unsaid fears. "I've already reached out to Interpol, but they've made it clear that their authority is extremely limited in international waters. They can't provide direct assistance, and at most, they can take over after the whole incident concludes. So, this mission...Ultimately, it's only us."

His hands trembled slightly as he retrieved his tablet,the cold screen casting harsh light over the structural schematics and personnel deployment plans of the Odin.

Hannah's breath warmed his cheek as they bent over the rescue plan together.

Meanwhile, aboard the Odin, the massive search clawed through the midnight hours, boots thundering across decks as they gutted every corner of the cruise ship. But Hannah remained a phantom.

Brixton's face turned to granite. He sat motionless at

the table's head, watching Aanya tremble on her knees before him like prey before a predator.

The core members flanked Brixton with heads bowed, afraid their very breathing might provoke his wrath.

"Aren't you and Hannah close?" Brixton's voice dripped venom as he stared Aanya down. "I'll ask you one more time-where is Hannah?"

Blood drained from Aanya's cheeks, leaving her skin waxy and pale, but she forced the familiar lie through trembling lips. "Mr. Ward, I swear I don't know.Hannah complained about feeling sick, so she went back to her room to rest. We said goodnight, and I haven't seen her since. I spent the whole evening in the kitchen, preparing your dinner."

She tried to absolve herself of blame.

Just then, Kayce stepped forward from the corner shadows, his timing calculated to perfection. "Mr.Ward, forgive me for interrupting, but I believe l witnessed Aanya escorting Ms. Scott toward the

bathroom last night. They appeared to be moving with considerable urgency."

Each word struck like a hammer blow, sealing Aanya's fate.

Brixton's eyes hardened into twin daggers. He rose with lethal grace, his boots echoing against the floor like a funeral march as he stalked toward the bathroom.

Scorpio and the others followed closely behińd.

The instant Brixton crossed the threshold, every instinct in his body roared to life. Something was off.

Though Aanya and her crew had scrubbed frantically to erase the obvious traces, Brixton's razor-sharp senses detected what they couldn't hide-subtle drag marks etched into the corner tiles.

Brixton towered over Aanya, ice radiating from his stare as he spoke with deadly calm. "Someone has definitely been locked up here. This is your last chance.Where is Hannah?"

Aanya's composure shattered like glass, but she clung to her final desperate lie."I don't know. I really don't know..." The words broke apart between ragged sobs.

A subordinate appeared at Scorpio's shoulder,whispering urgently into his ear. Scorpio's face went ashen as he turned to face Brixton. "Mr. Ward, Luna and several other dealers have broken under questioning."

Brixton's head snapped toward him with predatory focus."What did they say?"

Scorpio swallowed hard, his voice barely steady."They said that Ms. Scott was thrown into the sea by Aanya."

What?" The word erupted from Brixton like a gunshot, his entire presence shifting into something murderous.

Aanya crumpled to the floor as if her bones had turned to water, her mind spinning with bitter curses.Luna and those worthless cowards couldn't endure "I promise you!" Hannah melted into his embrace as she sealed the vow.

Vincent's throat worked against unsaid fears. "I've already reached out to Interpol, but they've made it clear that their authority is extremely limited in international waters.

Scorpio swallowed hard, his voice barely steady."They said that Ms. Scott was thrown into the sea by Aanya."

What?" The word erupted from Brixton like a gunshot, his entire presence shifting into something murderous.

Aanya crumpled to the floor as if her bones had turned to water, her mind spinning with bitter curses.Luna and those worthless cowards couldn't endure even basic pressure. All her careful planning, all the risks she'd taken, all the money she'd paid for their cooperation had dissolved into nothing.

The metallic click of Brixton's gun chamber loading cut through the air as he aimed the barrel at Aanya's skull. His voice turned to gravel, each word dripping with barely contained rage. "Wasn't Hannah good to you? She specifically requested that I assign you to the kitchen! Why did you betray her? Tell me!"

Death's cold breath touched Aanya's neck, and her last shreds of control evaporated. Words poured from her lips in a desperate torrent. "Because I love you too much, Mr. Ward! I truly do. How could I stand watching someone else take your heart? I fought my way onto this ship just to be near you. What makes Hannah so special? How could she possibly deserve to be your woman?I..."

"You deserve to die!" Brixton's eyes blazed with murderous fire as his finger tightened on the trigger,knuckles white with rage.

"No! You can't kill me!" Aanya's scream tore through the air like a siren. "My father is Hudson Chadwick,the Minister of Economy in Agosphia. If you kill me,my father will hunt you to the ends of the earth."

Brixton's hand froze mid-squeeze, a shadow of cold calculation flickering across his features. Hudson was their honored guest for the banquet in just a few days.

Scorpio lunged forward and yanked Aanya away from the gun's deadly aim.

"Bang!" The bullet hit the door behind where Aanya had been standing.

"Mr. Ward, please control yourself!" Scorpio pressed Aanya down with iron hands, desperation coating his voice. "Aanya can't die right now! If she lives, we can use her as leverage in our negotiations with Hudson."

Brixton's chest rose and fell like a bellows as the killing fury slowly drained from his eyes. He slammed his gun back into its holster, his voice turning to arctic steel. "Then make her suffer beyond

 imagination. Keep her breathing, but ensure every moment is agony."

"Understood!" Scorpio signaled his men, who dragged the half-conscious Aanya away like a broken doll.

Brixton moved to the window, his silhouette dark against the endless black sea. The silence stretched like a wound before he spoke again. "Deploy the speedboats, expand the search radius, and comb every inch of these waters. If Hannah is still alive,bring her back no matter the cost. If she's dead,bring me her body."
###Chapter 576 We Have So Little Time Together
Scorpio's brows knitted in confusion. "Mr. Ward,is this truly necessary? Perhaps the sea has already swallowed Ms. Scott whole..."

Brixton cut in, his voice sliding back into its usual,measured calm. "We have a scheduled meefing with Vincent, haven't we? Suppose Hannah was indeed gone, and we find her body. If Vincent doesn't believe the corpse we sent was Hannah, then we'll show him her true corpse. That is a sharper card to play in this negotiation."

Enlightenment struck Scorpio like a light switching on. "I'll take care of it right away!"

He departed briskly, his footsteps echoing determination.

Brixton lingered alone, silence draping itself over him

 like a heavy cloak. After a long moment, he moved as if guided by impulse, drifting into the kitchen below deck.

Kayce, elbows deep in breakfast preparations,straightened respectfully. "Mr. Ward, what brings you here? Do you need something?"

Fixing his gaze on the barren stove, Brixton murmured, almost absently, "Prepare me a bowl of beef pasta."

Kayce blinked in surprise and then quickly responded, "Of course."

His hands worked swiftly, familiar as clockwork,chopping and stirring with practiced rhythm.

Soon, a steaming plate of beef pasta sat before Brixton,fragrant with warmth.

Brixton took a bite, chewed slowly, and set the fork down with quiet finality. "This isn't the same taste,"he whispered, an unfamiliar note of loss threading through his voice. It lacked the flavor Hannah used to

bring to life.

Without another glance, Brixton turned and walked out. He knew Scorpio spoke the bitter truth: once cast into the sea,how could Hannah still be alive?

A sharp, piercing ache surged within him-alien,unwelcome, yet undeniable. It was the strange discomfort of grief. He finally understood the weight of death, not as an abstract notion but as a blade drawn across his own chest. For the first time,someone else's absence had carved real pain into him.

Meanwhile, aboard the Windchaser, Vincent and Hannah had finalized their rescue plan.

The core idea was simple: Vincent would meet Brixton as scheduled the next day to draw attention away, while Hannah would lead the team Vincent left behind to slip aboard the Odin and carry out the rescue.

If that failed, they had a fallback. They would wait for the "division of spoils" banquet in a few days, sow  discord over how the spoils were split, and use the ensuing chaos as cover-Vincent's people either launching an external attack or slipping in amid the confusion for the rescue.

"Tomorrow, I'll meet him as planned," Vincent said,studying the nautical chart with a calm face.

Hannah watched the handful of men preparing to accompany him and worried aloud. "You're taking too few people. Brixton's side will be heavily guarded.What if-"

Vincent took her hand and stopped her. "I'm the decoy. I only need enough to draw their focus. Your team is the key. Penetrating deep into enemy territory for a rescue requires enough men and enough firepower. Don't worry. I'll read the situation and adapt."

Hannah knew the plan made sense, but her heart still tightened. "Promise me you won't get hurt."

"All right," Vincent said, looking at her with depth."You too. Protect yourself first. Safety comes before

everything."

He pulled her into a tight embrace, reluctance in his voice. "It took so much effort to finally be reunited,yet we have so little time together."

Hannah buried her face against his steady chest."Once this is over and we're safe, we'll have time-plenty of it."

A pause, and then Vincent spoke quietly,the words heavy. "Hannah, when we get back safely,-will you remarry me?"

She lifted her head,surprised."Hm?"

His gaze was earnest. "Being apart this time made me realize how close I came to losing you forever."

He hesitated, voice thickening. "If... If something happens to me and we aren't remarried, I fear I won't be able to die in peace. Even in death, I want to be known as 'Hannah's husband'" His eyes did not waver from hers.

Hannah's chest tightened. She covered his mouth with her hand. "Don't say that. Nothing will happen to us. We'll return safely, and after that we'll be together forever-never to be separated again."

Vincent's eyes flared with emotion. "Is that a promise?"

She met his look and nodded solemnly. "Yes. I promise."

Joy broke over Vincent's face, and he pulled her into his arms once more.
###Chapter 577 A Sudden Change


Vincent's request for a meeting was answered almost at once by Brixton.

The time was fixed at five in the evening, and the place-a lonely pier on the edge of town.

It was a choice that spoke volumes: secluded,watchful, a stage where Brixton could pull the strings to his liking.

Before stepping away, Vincent wrapped Hannah tightly in his arms, repeating the same reminder as though it were a prayer. "Whatever happens,your safety comes first."

Turning to his most trusted aide, Vincent commanded with a steel edge in his voice, "Nate,Ms. Scott's protection rests with you. No matter what,guard her well!"

Nate gave a solemn nod. "You have my word, Mr.

Jones. Unless I fall, no harm will ever touch Ms.Scott."

Hannah's gaze clung to Vincent, worry plain in her voice. "And you-don't push yourself. Don't let yourself be hurt."

"Alright." Vincent gave her one last profound look and then boarded the speedboat with his guards,cutting across the waters toward the pier.

From the deck, Hannah watched Vincent recede into the distance. She began to count the minutes silently, each tick of time pressing heavily against her heart.

When a speedboat appeared from Odin's direction,Hannah knew the curtain had risen. "Act now!" she ordered.

At once, Nate gathered a team of elite bodyguards,each disguised in plain clothing, and they slipped aboard another speedboat bound for Odin.

Their vessel blended among the glittering boats of

wealthy gamblers, gaining passage without raising suspicion.

Once aboard, Hannah noticed immediately-the guards were fewer than usual.

The casino itself still rang with noise and clinking glasses, yet mutters of complaint surfaced between the gamblers. "Strange. There are even fewer pretty dealers today."

"Yeah, the vibe is awful! Heard something háppened last night?"

"Word is, someone fell overboard. Caused a stir all right."

Hannah grasped the truth in a flash. Brixton had learned of her plunge into the sea, and he had likely traced the matter back to Aanya and the others.Brixton was already tightening his net, investigating and reshuffling.

Without delay, Hannah used her familiarity with the layout to slip past the main corridors, heading

straight toward the kitchen area. She had to make contact with Kayce first.

At the corner of a hushed hallway, she finally spotted Kayce. "Key to the second deck," she said firmly,hand outstretched, wasting no breath on greetings.

Kayce's eyes flickered with a swirl of feelings-shock and relief. "I thought you'd left, that you wouldn't come back."

"I keep my word," Hannah replied with unyielding calm."The key."

"It's not on me, I hid it in my cabin. I'll fetch it now!"Kayce promised quickly. "You get ready-I'll bring Alfredo to you at once, soyou can take her with you."

"Good.Hurry." Hannah gave a curt nod.

Kayce turned and rushed away.

Meanwhile, Hannah signaled to Nate and his men,scattered through the ship, to stand ready.

Moments later, the casino exploded into turmoil. Nate and his team struck with sudden force,seizing control of vital choke points. His voice rang out over the din: "Stay still! We're here for money, nothing else! If you value your lives, lie down and keep quiet!"

The gamblers, pale with terror, obeyed without hesitation.

But Brixton's men wasted no time. They drew their weapons, and in the blink of an eye, the casino was engulfed in gunfire.

Shots cracked through the air, mingled with panicked screams, until the whole hall shuddered with chaos.

Amid the uproar, Hannah stole toward the staircase leading to the second deck, her pulse quickening as she awaited Kayce and the key.

At last, Kayce appeared, dragging Alfredo with him through a side passage.

Frightened by the gunfire, Alfredo clutched Kaycee's shirt hem tightly, timid. "What's happening down there? Why is it so loud?"

Hannah quickly stepped forward to reassure Alfredo,"Don't be afraid, Alfredo. Everything will be fine. I'll get you out soon."

Kayce added his own words of comfort and then fished into his pocket. "Here, I've got the key. Let's go-"

The sentence was cut short. Just as Kayce handed the key over, Alfredo-who had seemed weak and trembling-suddenly revealed a chilling resolve in her eyes.

From the wide sleeve of her garment, Alfredo drew a sharp pair of scissors. With startling strength, she drove them deep into Kayce's back.

It happened in the blink of an eye. Hannah froze in disbelief.

Blood gushed as Alfredo wrenched the scissors free.

"Alfredo! What are you doing?" Hannah gasped,dropping to her knees beside Kayce, frantic to stanch the wound.
###Chapter 578 A Different Existence


Alfredo's fingers clenched the bloodstained scissors,her face carved from stone. Her eyes bore into Kayce, who lay sprawled across the floor, her expression twisted between years of buried anguish and savage satisfaction. "This day has been far too long in coming. The image of my mother's final moments burns in my memory still. Her death was all because of you!" The accusation tore from her throat.

Kayce's breath came in ragged gasps, crimson trickling from his lips. Meeting Alfredo's gaze, his mouth curved into a smile tinged with relief. "So you remember everything..."

"Every detail lives within me! Not one day has passed where I allowed myself to forget!" Tears carved paths down Alfredo's cheeks as her voice cracked."Tonight marks the first time you've dropped your defenses and turned your back to me. At last... At long last, I could strike you down. Mom's spirit can finally rest!"

The final words erupted from her like a battle cry.

Hannah's understanding dawned like a cold sunrise.
"Your mind was always clear."

"Crystal clear!" Alfredo whirled to face Hannah."The innocent act was my only shield. Playing the damaged child was the sole way to breathe beside such a beast. Through all these endless years,I've held my patience, waiting for the moment his blood would stain my hands. Tonight, fate delivered!"Madness danced across her features.

Kayce's lips curved into something deeper than mere acceptance. His voice barely rose above a whisper."Good... This ending is good..."

He even thought that Alfredo's blade hadn't pierced deep enough for swift death. Summoning his final strength, he pushed himself upright, wrapped his fingers around Alfredo's trembling hand, and drove the scissors deeper into his own flesh. A strangled sound escaped Kayce's throat as his vision began to blur. "Alfredo... find happiness in life... I'll beg your mother's forgiveness in whatever comes after..."

"No!" The words ignited Alfredo's fury. She lunged forward, fists hammering against his failing form."Leave my mom alone! You have no right to find her!You ruined her life, and now you seek redemption?Dream on. Hell's flames are your only destination!"

Hannah's instincts kicked into motion. Shé darted forward and wrapped her arms around Alfredo,dragging her back from Kayce's still form. "Alfredo,stop! Look at him! He's gone! It's over!"

Alfredo crumpled earthward, her breathing wild and desperate. Her hollow stare settled on Kayce's lifeless form while she whispered, "Death grants him mercy, far more than he deserved..."

When Hannah reached out to offer comfort, Alfredo recoiled with venom in her eyes. "Keep your hands away! You are close to him! The sight of you sickens me!" Hannah's outstretched hand hung frozen in midair.Reading the storm in Alfredo's expression, she spoke with quiet understanding. "My closeness to him served one purpose only. He begged me to help you escape this place."

"Stop painting him as noble!" Alfredo's voice cracked with fresh rage. "His desire to send me away stemmed from guilt alone! Every crime he committed haunted his conscience. He deserves a fate far worse than rotting in hell!"

Hannah's composure never wavered. "I won't speak in his defense. Your judgment rings true-he owed a debt that only suffering could repay." Her eyes locked onto Alfredo's with unwavering focus. "What matters now is your choice. Will you come with me?Leave this ship?"

Alfredo's laugh held no warmth, only bitter suspicion."Leave? After this bloodbath? Do you truly believe escape remains possible?"

"It is possible." Hannah's gaze was determined.

"Why should I trust you?" Alfredo's voice trembled with raw emotion. "What guarantee do I have that you won't become another Kayce? Wearing a mask of compassion while harboring darkness underneath? Every act of kindness feels like deception now."

"Because tonight's bloodshed unfolded exactly as l intended." Hannah met her gaze without wavering.I gambled everything to return for souls like you,imprisoned in this nightmare. Place your faith in me just this once, and beyond these walls awaits a completely different existence. Youth still flows in your veins. Countless possibilities stretch before you.You can start over."

"A different existence?" Alfredo echoed the words,hope and uncertainty dancing in her gaze. "Someone stained with blood like me can truly start over?"

"Absolutely!" Hannah caught that spark of vulnerability and pressed forward. Steel rang through her voice as she declared, "The choice lies entirely in your hands. Trust me just once!"

While Alfredo wavered in indecision, Hannah dropped to her knees beside Kayce's corpse. She soon found the crucial key to the second-deck cell.

"My word is my bond!" Hannah brandished the key before Alfredo's startled eyes. "Every prisoner walks free tonight!"

Suddenly, a furious voice exploded from the third-deck stairwell. "Hannah? You're not dead?"
###Chapter 579 No One Appreciates It


Hannah and Alfredo abruptly looked up, only to see Scorpio standing on the stairs, his face a mix of shock and dark suspicion as he watched them.

Scorpio had originally planned to go with Brixton for the negotiation, but Brixton had ordered him to stay behind-said someone needed to keep tormenting Aanya and her crew for scheming against Hannah.

With clear reluctance, Scorpio had obeyed. Moments earlier, he'd been in the bathroom, torturing Aanya on Brixton's orders, when the burst of gunfire rattled the walls. Curiosity and unease had dragged him out,and now he stood staring at the impossible: Hannah -who should have been swallowed by the sea-standing there alive, Alfredo at her side, and Kayce sprawled in a bloody heap.

They were currently standing at the topo of the stairs on the second deck. Hannah's pulse jolted, a curse flashing through her mind. Scorpio hadn't left with Brixton? Forcing her breathing steady, she slipped the key into her sleeve without letting her fingers tremble.

Then, Hannah stepped in front of Alfredo, subtly angling her body to shield her, her posture braced and ready. Locking eyes with Scorpio's piercing stare, she fought to hold her words steady."Someone rescued me."

Scorpio's eyes thinned as he descended the stairs,each step deliberate. "You really are lucky," he commented with unnerving calm. "So why come back?"

His gaze dropped to Kayce sprawled on the floor,blood pooling beneath him. "And Kayce-what happened to him?"

"I... I don't know." Hannah forced a tremor into her tone, layering calculated fear over every word."Everything erupted downstairs-gunfire, shouting.I panicked and tried to run to the third deck to hide.When I got to the second deck, I... I found Kayce

lying here. I didn't see who did it."

The suspicion in Scorpio's face didn't ease.His eyes flicked past Hannah to Alfredo. "Tell me the truth,Alfredo. What exactly happened here?"

Alfredo's shoulders quivered. She ducked her head,retreating into the blank, childlike persona she'd perfected. She muttered, voice airy and unfocused,"Do you have any goodies?I wanna eat."

"Fucking useless!" Scorpio snarled, spitting the word like venom before turning away from Alfredo.

Dropping into a crouch, Scorpio studied Kayce's wound, his frown digging deeper with every glance."One strike. Straight through the heart," he muttered,his voice sharp with disbelief. "For someone as quick and capable as Kayce, letting anyone close was unthinkable-being killed so neatly was nearly impossible. For someone to hit at this range..."

His head lifted, cold eyes darting between Hannah and Alfredo. A spark of doubt lit up his eyes."It had to be someone he trusted. That's why he never

fought back."

The malice in his expression deepened. Rising to his full height, he reached for the gun at his waist, intent clear-he meant to take them alive and drag the truth out of them.

Before he could draw, a gunshot cracked through the air.

The bullet tore past Scorpio, grazing his side and smashing into the wall behind with a sharp,splintering thud.

Scorpio hit the floor in one smooth motion, rolling until he was shielded by the nearest crate. A sheen of cold sweat broke out across his temples.

Nate was the one who'd pulledthe trigger. He and his men had advanced to the second deck exactly as planned-and they'd just caught Scorpio in the act of threatening Hannah. Without hesitation, Nate had fired a single warning shot.

"Son of a bitch!" Scorpio snarled, flattening himself behind cover, the chance to seize Hannah and Alfredo slipping through his fingers.

Hannah's pulse spiked, but she seized the moment.Forcing her voice into a false calm, she called out toward Scorpio, loud enough for Nate's team to hear,"Scorpio! What do we do now? Looks like they're about to break through!"

Pinned down by relentless fire, Scorpio hit the deck and scrambled for cover, sweat running down his temple. He jammed the radio to his mouth,barking through gritted teeth, "All of you,move! Follow my command and kill every single bastard!"

His first thought was survival, the second-holding the line. Snatching up his rifle, he charged down the stairs, signaling for his men to follow. If the first deck fell, their entire operation-and profit-would go with it.

With Scorpio distracted, Hannah spun around,fingers tight on the key hidden in her sleeve.Heart hammering, she dashed to the nearest cages and began unlocking them one by one. "Quick, come on!" she hissed, leaning close to the bars. "If you want to live,follow me!"

But instead of rushing to freedom, the women inside recoiled as if she'd struck them. They clung to each other desperately, their faces drained of all color,eyes stretched wide with unfiltered terror.

A gaunt woman's voice cracked as she shook her head violently. "Nó! I'm not going out there. They'll cut us open and sell our organs! You're lying! I won't fall for it!"

"Indeed-it's worse out there! In here, at least we're breathing for now."

"You're just trying to lure us out so you can sell us somewhere even worse. I know how people like you work."

"We won't go! We'd rather die here than take our chances outside!"

Years of living under fear and cruelty had warped their thinking. The cages had twisted into a grim kind

of refuge in their minds, a place where danger felt distant if only for a moment. The world beyond those bars loomed as an unknown,hostile place-one they believed would devour them the instant they stepped out.

Hannah gauged their terrified faces and softened her tone."Listen to me-I'm not here to hurt you. I came to get you out. My name's Hannah. Brixton caught me too, but I found a way to escape.I can get you off this ship and back to freedom."

Her plea met only silence.

The cage doors hung wide open, yet not a single woman dared to move.

Alfredo crossed her arms with a bitter little laugh."See? What's the point of all that effort? No one appreciates it."

The moment was shattered by a sudden lull in the firefight. Scorpio seized the opening, charging up to the second deck with several armed men at his back.

His gaze landed on the open cages, and his expression went dark as thunder. "Hannah!" he roared, his voice cutting through the chaos. "What the hell do you think you're doing?"
###Chapter 580 A Tense Meeting


Confronted by the women-battered, trembling, and unwilling to place their trust in her-Hannah realized instantly that there was no luxury of hesitation or facades. She could not remain passive; action was demanded of her.

Hannah pivoted and fixed her eyes on Scorpio."Can't you see? I'm here to take them out of this place."
"You're flirting with your own destruction!" Scorpio thundered, drawing a pistol and leveling it at Hannah.

The instant Scorpio brought the firearm up, Hannah moved with catlike speed, sliding sideways and surging forward; she used precise judo leverage to sweep close in, seize Scorpio's gun-wielding wrist,and hurl him forward over her shoulder with brutal force.

Scorpio struck the floor with a sickening impact, and the handgun skittered from his grip.

Simultaneously, Scorpio's subordinates sprang into action, raising their weapons and unleashing a barrage toward Hannah.

"Defend Ms. Scott!" Nate barked, and he, with his elite unit, immediately returned controlled, lethal fire.

The responding shots quickly neutralized several of Scorpio's men.

A violent firefight tore through the room.

Relying on the suppressing fire from Nate and his team, Hannah darted low and slid behind a makeshift barricade with agile precision.

Scorpio scrambled, snatching up the pistol that had fallen nearby; though struggling to his feet,he stubbornly fired in Hannah's direction.

Nate saw it, his gaze sharpening, and without a second thought, he squeezed the trigger.

"Bang!" The round struck Scorpio squarely in the

forehead as he attempted to pull himself upright.

Everything unfolded so fast that nobody had the time to alter their course.

The combat continued unabated.

Hannah sucked in air, pushed herself upright, and looked straight at the women confined inside the cages. "Do you believe me now? I am not your enemy -I came to free you."

Only a heavy, oppressive quiet met her plea.

A shadow passed over Hannah's face as disappointment and resolve settled in.

Meanwhile, in another tense theater, Vincent's parley with Brixton was underway, each moment steeped in unease.

Slippery and calculating, Brixton had repeatedly shifted the meeting location at the last minute, trying to disrupt any preparations Vincent might have orchestrated.

Outwardly,Vincent wore a composed mask, buying precious minutes for Hannah's extraction to unfold.

At last, in a deserted warehouse on the edge of a forgotten town, the two men faced each other. The air hung taut; both entourages watched with hawkish attention.

Brixton offered a cunning grin and said, "Mr. Jones,your reputation precedes you. A pleasure to finally meet you."

Vincent played along, deliberately stretching the exchange. "So you're the one above that incompetent Erica.How intriguing."

A curl of contempt crossed Brixton's face. "Had you not mentioned her, I might have let that name vanish from my thoughts."

Vincent answered with cool dismissal, "She kept her lips sealed and didn't disclose anything substantial.You have a loyal subordinate."

Brixton arched an eyebrow. "Odd. I had assumed your immediate priority would be the matter of your former wife, Hannah, rather than indulging in this small talk."

Vincent continued to stall, his voice even."Everything proceeds in order. With someone like you,haste would be foolish."

Brixton studied Vincent with narrowed eyes. "From where I sit, you give no impression of urgency. Don't you want to know about how Hannah died? And where her body might be?"

Vincent's expression hardened into an icy certainty."I don't believe for a second that she's dead."

Brixton shrugged. "I expected as much. But the reality is, she is deceased. Truly gone. What makes you so certain the corpse isn't hers?"

Suddenly, Vincent's anger exploded, and he crushed a cup on the table. Blood oozed out, but he paid it no heed.

Immediately, the bodyguards from the two sides raised their weapons and trained them on one another.

"I don't appreciate jokes," Vincent said, his tone low and dangerous.

Brixton enjoyed watching his loss of composure and smiled. "I'm not joking. The corpse is stored at my place, all chilled and ready. The only question is whether you're willing to make a deal, Mr. Jones."

Brixton's mind worked beneath the smile-they had not actually procured Hannah's corpse. He needed the illusion of control to dominate the conversation.

Vincent affected outrage. "You propose trading a cadaver with me? Is that meant to be an offer?"

Brixton leaned in, voice honeyed and coaxing. "A lifeless body carries little market value. But if it's Hannah, its worth to you would be beyond measure.She matters to you, does she not?"

Vincent kept up his charade. "If your ploy is to use her as bargaining leverage, why would you have

allowed her to perish?"

Brixton sighed theatrically. "Believe me, it grieved me too. But on a ship, accidents happen. Fate dealt her a cruel hand. You've searched tirelessly for her.I assume you would not wish her remains to be tossed into the sea for scavengers."

Vincent fell silent briefly, forcing his temper down. "A billion dollars in cash. Return her remains to me."

Brixton shook his head, eyes calculating. "If she were alive, I'd happily accept that sum. But for a corpse,that price is excessive. I will exchange Hannah's body for something else of value," he said, coldly confident. "Trust me-the trade will be worthwhile."
###Chapter 581 The Real Purpose


Vincent's gaze sharpened, a glint of menace in his eyes. "Oh? Let's hear it."

Brixton finally revealed his true purpose. "I want exclusive trading rights to the strategic deep-water port in Agosphia for the next ten years-along with half of the operational revenue."

An icy edge crept over Vincent's expression, chilling it further. "So that was your real aim from the start."Because of this port, Brixton had taken Hannah,leaving her to suffer all this time.

With a sharp lift of his eyebrow, Brixton's words carried firm determination. "Absolutely. The billion-dollar ransom was nothing but bait to get you here.Mr. Jones, we've had our eyes on that port for a long while."

He let the silence stretch before continuing in a drawl, "If Hoffman hadn't been such a fool-if he'd


been sharper, more capable-l wouldn't have had to get involved myself."

Vincent let out a bitter, humnorless laugh as the realization sank in-Hoffman had been working with Brixton all along. His mouth curved into a cold sneer."You're all the same-scheming in the shadows,too cowardly to face a man head-on. Women are the only ones you dare to harm."

Brixton only rolled a shrugged, his expression relaxed. "Well, your port is too tempting, Mr. Jones.In the end, only results matter-victory justifies everything." He tilted his head, eyes glinting with provocation. "So tell me-will you trade the port's rights for your woman's body?"

Vincent forced his features into a mask of thoughtfulness, stretching the silence to buy more time for Hannah. "Those trading rights aren't a toy.They involve countless partners and interests. I'll need time to wveigh the decision."

Brixton blinked, then threw back his head and laughed, the sound exaggerated and mocking."Hah! I thought you'd agree without hesitation. Looks like l overestimated how much Hannah means to you."

In that instant, one of Brixton's subordinates-Vulture -strode over and bent close, murmuring something urgent.

The carefree smile slipped from Brixton's face in a heartbeat. He stood abruptly and fixed Vincent with a sharp look. "Mr. Jones, you have three days to decide," he said coolly. "I expect to hear good news by then."

His tone dropped to a chilling edge as he added,"But let me remind you-Hannah's body won't be able to wait much longer."

Without another word, Brixton turned on his heel and stalked out of the warehouse, his entourage falling in behind him.

Vincent remained still, watching until their silhouettes disappeared into the night, his mind spinning with calculations.

A subordinate approached cautiously. "Mr. Jones,should we send a team to intercept them-to buy more time for Ms. Scott's sake?"

Vincent lifted a hand in a curt gesture. "No need. It's not time to rip the mask off just yet. Get word to Nate -tell them to pull back as planned and make sure everyone gets out safely."

"Understood!"

Soon, Brixton and his crew leapt onto the speedboat,the engine roaring to life.

Vulture hesitated, his brow furrowed, before he finally spoke. "Mr. Ward, if Vincent actually agrees to this deal, whose body are we giving him? We still haven't found Hannah's."

A lethal gleam settled in Brixton's eyes, sharp and unyielding. "What are you panicking for? When the time comes, we'll take care of Aanya-the one who dared to kill Hannah. We'll send her body instead.That should be enough." The one who truly ended Hannah's life-that would please Vincent greatly.

Brixton snapped back to the present, his tone sharp and edged with fury. "Step on it! I want to know who had the guts to mess with my place while I was away."

Aboard the Odin, the metallic air reeked of blood and gunpowder.

Nate got the retreat order and immediately began barking commands, pulling his team into formation.

Without a second thought, Hannah shoved Alfredo straight toward Nate.

With a jolt of shock, Alfredo staggered a step back."What are you doing?"

"He's getting you out of here," Hannah answered in a rush. "Nate, take her and go!"

Both Alfredo and Nate blurted out at once,"What about you?"

"I'm staying," Hannah replied, her tone cutting off any argument.


Nate's jaw tightened, panic flashing in his eyes. "No way-this is suicide! If Brixton comes back and sees this bloodbath, you'll be the first one he blames!"

"That's exactly why I can't leave." Hannah's words came fast, urgent. "If I run now and Brixton returns to find Scorpio dead and plenty of his men gone, he'll go mad-and these women will be the ones who suffer. If I stay, I can at least try to bargain with him and buy them a chance to live."

"But..." Nate began, but Hannah's sharp voiće sliced through his protest. "No buts! Time's running out.Get her out of here!"

Alfredo's gaze lingered on Hannah, her face twisted with conflict, before she snapped, "You think throwing your life away makes you some kind of saint? If you die here, Hannah, I won't mourn for you!"
Hannah's lips curved into a calm, almost defiant smile. "Relax, it'll take a lot more than this to kill me.Alfredo, walking out of this place means you get to start over. Let go of what happened here. If you have


a dream, a destination-find a man named Vincent Jones. Tell him the kind of life you want. He'll see you get the money, a place to stay, and protection."

Her words came fast, urgent, before she turned back to Nate, her tone turning firm. "Make sure nothing happens to her. That's not a request. It's an order!"
###Chapter 582 How Did You Manage To Survive
Tension carved deep lines across Nate's face as strain overtook his features. "Ms. Scott, if Mr. Jones finds out we've left you alone in this lion's den, he'll have our heads!"

Though Hannah's eyes softened for a heartbeat,her voice stayed firm. "He won't. If he's angry, tell him this was my call. Tell him I forced you to leave me behind. He'll understand."

She knew Vincent well enough to expect his fury, but ultimately, he would grasp the reasoning behind her choice.

Nate and his men exchanged uneasy glances,reluctance written across their faces.

"Get out of here, quick!" Hannah ordered,her voice taut with urgency. "If Brixton comes back with

backup, none of us will get out alive. Everyone will die. Take a few of the cash boxes with you. Make it look like a robbery. Otherwise, they are going to wonder why I'm the only one untouched."

Seeing the unshakable resolve in her eyes, Nate knew staying any longer would only endanger everyone. With fierce resolve burning in his voice,he bellowed, "Get moving!"

His men burst into motion, grabbing several money boxes, dragging a protesting Alfredo with them as they retreated swiftly along the escape route.

Watching them leave, Hannah sprang into action.She went down the row of cages, locking each one with quick, precise movements. Bending close, she hissed, "Listen carefully-nothing happened today.You didn't witness a damn thing, and you sure didn't hear one. One slip of the tongue, and I'll personally make sure it's the last thing you ever say.Got it?"

When coaxing and persuasion failed, she resorted to instilling fear.

 Her hard-edged threat struck home far better than her earlier persuasion ever had. The women shrank back, shaking so hard that their teeth nearly chattered, both hands clamped over their mouths as if afraid a single sound might doom them.

With that handled, Hannah hurried to check Scorpio and the fallen men nearby. A quick look brought her relief-they weren't breathing anymore.

In the distance, the low rumble of speedboat engines crept closer, cutting through the stillness. Brixton was on his way back.

Without missing a beat, Hannah moved with sharp precision. She smeared more of the dark, sticky blood from the floor onto her face and clothes,making herself look battered and desperate, and then dragged herself to a spot partially hidden from view. Curling up, she shut her eyes and went limp, as though she had fainted.

Moments later, Brixton and his men stormed aboard the Odin.

Brixton's piercing stare swept over the wreckage, his expression sharpening into something lethal.

"Damn it!" Vulture exploded when he caught sight of Scorpio's lifeless body. His fury was palpable as he barked, "Mr. Ward, I'll take a team to chase them!They can't have gotten far!"

Without waiting for Brixton's command, he bolted away with a team at his heels.

Brixton ignored Vulture. His cold gaze swept over the blood-spattered deck until it locked onto Hannah crouched in the corner. He closed the distance in measured strides, boots thudding against the floor.

At the perfect moment, Hannah let out a faint, pitiful groan. Her lashes fluttered as she feigned waking."Brixton? You're finally here."

She made a show of struggling to sit up, her arms trembling.

Shock flickered across Brixton's face as he said,"You're alive?"

His voice held a flicker of relief he himself hadn't even registered.

"I nearly didn't make it" she murmured, her voice shaking. "But someone saved me."

Inside, Hannah stayed razor-sharp, but on the surface, she kept her wide-eyed fear. Sticking to her story, she continued, "I barely made it back here when a gunfight suddenly erupted. Scorpio was fallen, your guys were taken out, and the cash vanished in the chaos."

She framed the blood-soaked chaos as a robbery,trying to steer Brixton's suspicions elsewhere.

But his attention didn't settle on the missing money.He crouched, his dark eyes drilling into hers, voice low and weighty. "How did you manage to survive?"

She forced a practiced tremor into her face, letting calculated fear and sorrow mingle. "I was terrified, so I hid. They didn't find me."

"You hid?" Brixton echoed, his tone edged with  doubt. "All those bodies, all that stolen money-and you only suffered a few scratches?"

His stare sent an icy shiver through her. She deflected quickly. "Maybe I found a really good hiding place. They were too busy grabbing the money to bother searching for me. Besides,Scorpio and his men shielded me."

She feigned a look of deep sorrow.

Brixton's gaze slid over her shaking shoulders."Why are you trembling?" he asked suddenly, his voice deceptively calm.
###Chapter 583 An Unexpected Twist


"Just now, it was too terrifying," Hannah murmured, her hand brushing away a tear with deliberate care."Scorpio, Kayce... They collapsed right in front of me, their blood spraying across the deck. I was certain I would be next."

Brixton studied her quietly, his stare weighted with suspicion, as though measuring whether her words could be trusted.

Rising from his chair, Brixton strode over to Scorpio's fallen form, crouched, and pressed his fingers against Scorpio's throat and chest, verifying the absence of both breath and pulse. Death was confirmed.

But then, a faint groan rippled through the silence-one of the wounded still clung to life a short distance away.

At the sound, Brixton moved toward him with steady, deliberate steps.

A jolt of dread shot through Hannah. That man was still conscious. If he spoke, would he unravel her entire lie?

Brixton knelt beside the bloodied figure, examining the grievous injuries.

Sensing Brixton's presence, the man forced his eyelids apart, his lips twitching faintly as though words were trapped inside his failing body...

The atmosphere on the upper deck tightened, thick and breathless, as though the air itself trembled.

Cold sweat drenched Hannah's palms in an instant. An idea struck, and she pointed in another direction,shifting Brixton's focus. "I heard something strange. While I was hiding, Scorpio said Kayce was betrayed and stabbed by someone close to him. And right after Scorpio revealed that, he was shot down."

She intentionally muddied the key information, successfully diverting Brixton's attention.

Brixton's expression darkened; he rose abruptly and crossed to Kayce's body, crouching low to examine the deep knife wound in his chest. His brows knit together, carrying the same weight of disbelief Scorpio had shown earlier. With Kayce's abilities, such a strike should have been avoided. Such a wound indeed suggested betrayal by someone trusted.

Brixton suddenly snapped his head up, his gaze sharp as steel, cutting straight into Hannah."SOyou truly saw nothing?"

Her stomach tightened, but she held her mask of confusion. "Nothing at all. I was terrified, hiding the whole time. I couldn't see-only the sounds reached me."

He searched her face for long, drawn seconds. At last, he appeared to accept the answer, at least for now.

Turning back to the groaning subordinate, Brixton approached and crouched down-only to discover that the man had exhaled his final breath, silenced forever before speaking.

Brixton's features grew grim, the shadows on his face deepening. He rose to his full height, his presence pressing down like a suffocating weight.

Below deck, the gamblers had long since fled when the gunfire broke out, leaving the ship heavy with emptiness, the silence unnatural.

It was then that Vulture stormed back with his men, fury and frustration written on his face. "Forgive me, Mr.Ward. I lost them! Couldn't catch them! Those bastards slipped away too fast, and the fog swallowed their tracks."

Brixton did not erupt. He stood still for a few beats before his voice emerged, cold as iron, more to himself than to Vulture. "Do you think it's a mere chance those raiders struck while I was gone, slaughtering and looting?"

Vulture hesitated, watching Brixton cautiously, and then muttered, "I would't presume..."

"Answer me!" Brixton snapped, his tone razor-sharp.

Vulture swallowed and steadied himself, forcing the words out. "Mr. Ward, the only name that makes sense is Hudson Chadwick. Aren't we planning a banquet for him in a few days? Maybe he wants a bigger cut or to keep it all for himself, so he sent his men over while you were away-took everything, spilled blood, showing his strength before negotiations."

The more he spoke, the firmer his voice became, until anger sharpened every word. "Mr. Ward, it has to be him. We can't let this slide! Since he struck us first, we should strike back-hit hard!"

Hannah lowered her head, quietly memorizing the name-Hudson Chadwick. So he was the honored guest for the upcoming banquet? And Brixton's men believed Hudson orchestrated the attack? What an unexpected twist. If Brixton accepted this story, suspicion would never turn toward Vincent.

Listening to Vulture's analysis, Brixton did not refute, seemingly agreeing with the possibility. He lifted a hand, cutting off Vulture's growing fury. "Patience. His daughter is still here. When he comes to the banquet, we'll settle both debts-past and present."

Vulture frowned, reluctant to drop the matter like this."Mr.Ward,but-"

"It's settled," Brixton declared, his tone unyielding. "Clean up the scene. Give Scorpio and the others a respectful farewell. See their families well provided for-double what we promised."

"Yes, Mr. Ward!" Vulture replied, immediately setting men into motion.

From the side, Hannah observed wordlessly. She noted that Brixton's idea of a respectful farewell involved cremating Scorpio's and the others' bodies right on the deck.

But amid the grim process, Vulture stiffened, eyes narrowing. After counting carefully, he stepped up to Brixton, his voice uneasy. "Mr. Ward, something's wrong. One body's missing. Alfredo isn't here. Could he have slipped away in the chaos? Or worse-was he working for Hudson all along?"
###Chapter 584 Can't Bear To Leave Me


Hannah's chest constricted, every muscle tightening as she strained to decipher the fragments of Brixton and Vulture's hushed exchange.

Brixton's stare hardened into a blade of ice. All of it stemmed from Alfredo-because of him, Kayce's vigilance faltered, and the ambush struck. His words landed like a verdict, confirming Vulture's suspicion."It seems to be the case. Kayce let his guard fall because of Alfredo. That bumbling display was never real-it was a mask, a performance meant to deceive." Then, his tone deepened, expression carved in stone.′′A cruelly clever design."

Vulture spat into the dirt, his fury venomous. "Kayce was blind! To be killed by the one he trusted the most...What a fucking pathetic way to go."

Brixton stood in silence, watching Kayce's ashes being collected into an urn, something unreadable flashing in his eyes like a ripple through steel. At last, his voice emerged, frigid with command. "Forget about preserving Kayce's ashes. Let the sea be his resting place. As for the others' ashes, their families can mourn them."

Vulture froze, startled at the pitiless dismissal of Kayce, who had stood beside Brixton for countless years.Yet,questioning was unthinkable. He swallowed his shock, convincing himself Brixton's cruelty burned only from rage at seeing Kayce's trust twisted into betrayal. With a quick bow, he murmured, "Understood."

Expression blank, Vulture cast Kayce's ashes intothe sea, the gray dust vanishing into endless water.

Hannah lingered at the edge, sorrow mingling with bitter irony as the sight pressed against her heart. Kayce,who had lived a life filled with misdeeds, had died under Alfredo's hand-the very one he tried so desperately to shield. Even in death, no rest found him, claimed instead by the merciless sea. Perhaps it was punishment long overdue.

Brixton lingered nearby, unmoving, silence sealing away his emotions.

Hannah shrank into herself, breath shallow, trying to blend into the shadows. Time dragged before Brixton finally turned toward Hannah, his voice cutting through the stillness."I expected you to question why I treated Kayce this way."

Hannah lowered her eyes. "Whatever decisions you make are guided by reasons I have no right to demand.Nor do I care to."
Brixton let out a faint sound, almost a laugh edged with scorn. "Kayce had no kin, no blood ties. The sea is his only home. Better to return him to its embrace than bury him in foreign soil where he doesn't belong."

Although Hannah rejected the reasoning in her mind, she conceded outwardly. "It seems you've considered it carefully."

He dropped the subject.

The silence that followed grew heavy, awkward, and unbroken.

Then, suddenly, Brixton shifted the current of conversation. "Speaking of the sea-you're remarkable. No one else has survived being cast into its depths and returned alive."

His eyes locked on her, the question he had restrained until now rising to the surface.

Hannah's pulse spiked, but she quickly schooled her face into lingering fear. She recited the tale she had polished in advance. "It must have been nothing but luck. I didn't want to die, so l clung to a driftwood plank for a full day and night, screaming until my throat bled before finally attracting a passing fishing boat.Without it, I'd be a corpse."

Brixton listened with that same chilling stillness. "If fate dragged you back from death, why return here?" He closed the distance, his presence smothering. "What? Can't bear to leave me?"

His words dripped mockery, suspicion laced into every syllable.

Hannah forced composure, raising her gaze to meet his. "I was afraid Vincent wouldn't be able to find me.I was penniless, trapped by a language I couldn't understand. I had nowhere to go. Here, at least, I might cling to a thread of hope, a chance of reaching home."

She paused, as if carefully weighing the situation. "And I bet that Vincent holds something you desire,that you'd allow me to return to him for it. This place is the only link I have to him."

In her mind, it was flawless: a tale of necessity and calculation, stripping away any hint of attachment,painting her return as pure survival.

But Brixton's brow darkened, his gaze sinking deeper, unreadable and sharp. He shook his head slowly, his tone low and threatening. "Hannah, this is your final chance. Speak. Why did you really come back?"

Her heart dropped like a stone. He still didn't believe her? Suppressing her panic, she raised her voice."I told you the truth already! If you don't believe me, throw me into the sea again and see if another miracle saves me!"

Words tumbled from her lips, layering measured desperation with detail. "Yes, I thought of running, of finding Vincent myself. But..."

Her expression twisted with calculated anger and humiliation."The fisherman who saved me tried to trap me. To him, I was nothing but a destitute stray woman, and he sought to chain me to his witless son through marriage! He locked me away, tried to force me, until I escaped. I had no choice but to come back here. At least here, no one demands I wed a fool."

Her breathing quickened as she finished, eyes fixed on Brixton to gauge the impact.

Yet, his silence remained, expression carved into unreadable stone, leaving her adrift in uncertainty,unable to discern if he believed a single word.
###Chapter 585 Her Husband


After an extended stretch of silence, Brixton finally broke it, his words laced with an icy sharpness that carried an almost lethal weight. "Which fisherman dares to act with such recklessness? Tell me who it is,and I'll see that his entire bloodline pays the price."

Hannah's chest tightened violently, her pulse hammering as she shook her head with urgency. "Please, that isn't necessary! I've already returned here, and I want nothing more to do with him. And besides-he did save my life. I won't repay kindness with cruelty."

Brixton's gaze lingered on her, and then a faint smirk twisted his lips. "You always flinch the moment killing is mentioned. It unsettles you more than anything else."

A chill raced through Hannah's body; beads of cold sweat slid down her spine. Forcing her voice steady, she replied firmly, "I just can't joke about such things."

Just then, Vulture approached, having settled the ashes-delivery to the dead's families, his demeanor suggesting he had something to report to Brixton.

Sensing her chance, Hannah lowered her eyes and murmured, "If you've nothing else for me, l'll return to my room."

She didn't wait for Brixton to answer. With hurried steps, she slipped away. Only once she was far from Brixton's sight did she press her weight against the cold wall, gasping unevenly for breath. Brixton's doubts hadn't vanished; he had simply chosen not to pursue them-at least for now. Every step she took from here on would have to be guided by the sharpest caution.

Meanwhile, aboard the Windchaser, tension hung over the deck like a storm cloud.

Vincent stood rigid at the railing, his eyes narrowing as Nate's speedboat drew near. When he saw the group climbing aboard, his heart sank-the one face he longed for wasn't among them.

The boat thudded against the side, and Nate came up quickly with his men, Alfredo walking in their midst. Vincent's piercing eyes swept over the arrivals. "Where is Hannah? She didn't come back with you?"

Nate's head dipped, unease etched across his features. "Ms. Scott insisted on remaining."

Vincent's voice erupted with raw urgency. "What madness is this? Doesn't she realize how grave the danger is now?"

Nate's tone was heavy with frustration. "We tried everything to sway her, but she wouldn't yield. She said she had her reasons, and that you would understand."

Vincent could almost picture Hannah's stubborn exporession as she said those words. He knew her better than anyone; once her resolve hardened, no one could undo it. His men couldn't sway her.He forced himself to calm-now was not the moment to dwell on anger or blame.

Vincent's attention shifted sharply to the unfamiliar young person standing behind Nate. "Who is this?" he asked, his frown deepening.

Nate stepped aside respectfully. "Mr. Jones, this is the girl Ms. Scott risked everything to rescue."

Realization dawned on Vincent instantly. "You're Alfredo?"

Vincent remembered Hannah's hidden notes, how she had spoken of this girl's plight and her hope for the girl to live a life free of chains.

Alfredo raised her chin and met Vincent's eyes without fear. "So Hannah told you about me? Then you must be Vincent."

"I am," he replied with a nod.

Alfredo scrutinized him, her tone direct and even a bit sharp. "And what exactly are you to Hannah?"

Vincent didn't hesitate. "Her husband."

Alfredo blinked, faintly surprised, before giving a half-smile. "Funny... You don't look like a married pair."

Vincent let her remark pass without reaction, his mind fixed on clarity and Hannah's safety. He cut to the point. "Hannah wants you to begin anew. What life do you dream of? Speak it, and I'll see it arranged. This sea is perilous-you'll be sent to the mainland immediately."

Confusion flickered in Alfredo's eyes. "I don't even know what I want. I don't know where I belong." She hesitated and then added, "Maybe I could stay and help. I don't want to remain in Hannah's debt."

Vincent shook his head at once. "She would rather you be safe. The truest repayment is to stay alive, away from this chaos."

Without further questions, he reached inside his jacket and withdrew a sleek black card. He extended it to her. "This card holds fifty million dollars, usable anywhere without a passwvord. Use it wherever you wish.Whether you build a new life or live in comfort, the choice is yours. Consider it your beginning."

Alfredo's throat tightened, her voice catching. "Why... Why would you do so much for me?"

Vincent's eyes locked with hers, unwavering. "Because Hannah asked it of me. She believes you're still young, with years ahead to reshape your fate. She wants to see you rise again, not broken, but full of life."

Then, from his pocket, he produced a business card and pressed it into her hand.
###Chapter 586 Becoming Ruthless


Alfredo took the card, studying the shiny gold letters and title etched across its surface. She couldn't recognize all the characters on it. "What is this?" she asked. Confusion clouded her expression as she tried to decipher the words.

"Luminara Group, Chairman and CEO, Hannah Scott," Vincent announced, pride threading through his voice. "Should you ever need help or face insurmountable challenges, go to any Luminara Group branch with this card. The employees there will assist you without question."

Alfredo's fingers trembled as she traced the embossed letters. Only now did she grasp Hannah's dazzling,formidable identity. Complex emotions tangled within her chest.

Noting her lingering uncertainty, Vincent offered the most practical advice. "If you don't have a clear plan yet, I suggest you enroll in school. Pursue quality education and discover what possibilities await you."

"School?" The word tumbled from Alfredo's lips, alien and impossibly distant.

Vincent added, "Yes, school. Learn something. Enrich your mind. One day, you might become someone as exceptional as Hannah-someone equally capable of steering your own destiny."

The statement ignited something within Alfredo, cutting through her uncertainty like a blade of light.Becoming someone like Hannah? The goal held a strong appeal for her. She made up her mind in an instant."I want school! I'll study in Agosphia." Agosphia was where her mother had once lived.

"Alright." Vincent's phone was already in hand, orders flowing smoothly from his lips.

Within minutes, he nodded at Alfredo. "Everything is arranged. A vessel will soon come to transport you directly to Agosphia. Your housing and education are taken care of, every need covered. Leave this Chapter buried here, and move forward with your eyes fixed ahead. That's Hannah's wish for you."

Alfredo studied the man who'd meticulously arranged everything for her, emotions churning beneath her ribs. Gripping the bank card and business card like lifelines, she said solemnly, "Thank you. And please thank Hannah for me."

Vincent's tone turned earnest. "Lead a good life. That's the only repayment Hannah would ever want."

Alfredo nodded, resolve hardening in her expression.

Minutes later, a speedboat arrived to collect Alfredo.

Vincent's unease didn't fade as he watched her silhouette disappear across the water. He turned sharply to Nate. "I'm still not at ease with Hannah staying there alone. Starting now, surveillance on the Odin runs around the clock. Our operatives continue to disguise themselves as gamblers. Use every resource to secure her safety and extract whatever intelligence surfaces."

"Understood! I'll mobilize them immediately!" Nate answered without hesitation.


******

Hannah slipped back into her established rhythm. She cooked Brixton's meals and made calculated appearances in the casino just to slip information to Vincent's operatives under the cover of routine.

But the fragile calm shattered soon enough.

Still seething from the ambush, Brixton's fury eventually redirected toward the women trapped on the second deck.

Vulture had already started negotiations with buyers, and within days, those women would be auctioned off in batches like livestock. Their fate was predictable-exploitation or harvested for organs.

When Vulture briefed Brixton on arrangements for those women, Hannah's chest constricted. She knew she had to act, even if only to steal a few more days. She cut into their conversation deliberately. "Since you're selling them, shouldn't you maximize profit? Right now, they're gaunt and hollow-eyed-they'll barely fetch baseline prices. Feed them properly for a few days and restore some color to their faces. That way, whether selling people or organs, the price could double. We're not pressed for time, are we?"

Her pulse hammered as the words left her mouth.

Vulture thought for a moment and agreed. "Mr. Ward, she's got a point. We're not racing against any deadline for handling those women since we haven't finalized things with Hudson. Besides, we can seize the opportunity to hint at finding a buyer for Aanya. Might shake that cunning Hudson loose!"

Brixton didn't answer right away. His piercing gaze swung toward Hannah, dissecting her in oppressive silence for ten full seconds.

Cold sweat drenched Hannah's spine.

Finally, Brixton's voice emerged, flat and emotionless. "This is the first time l've thought you truly belong on this ship."

Hannah's heart stumbled. "You think I've become ruthless?"
###Chapter 587 Enraging Aanya


"Almost," Brixton muttered with deliberate ease, the faintest suggestion of amusement curving at the corner of his mouth. "But that's a good thing. It shows you're beginning to adapt to this place."

Hannah bowed her head, refusing to answer. Inside, revulsion twisted through her, every word he spoke making her stomach churn with dread, yet outwardly, she allowed no trace of it to slip.

Brixton appeared to accept her silence as an agreement, and after a thoughtful pause, he adopted her suggestion. His tone sharpened as he commanded Vulture, "Follow her idea-keep those women alive for the moment. And make sure Hudson hears of us finding a buyer for Aanya. Let him fret for a bit."

Vulture replied without hesitation, "Understood!"

A faint breath of relief stirred in Hannah's chest. For the moment, she had managed to win those women a fragile reprieve. Later, she happened upon Vulture speaking in hushed tones with his subordinates, and what she overheard struck her with startling clarity. Aanya, shockingly, was revealed to be Hudson's daughter. Even more disturbingly, Aanya was locked in the same bathroom where she herself had once been confined.

Hannah's thoughts surged-Brixton had spared Aanya, not out of mercy, but because she was an asset still worth exploiting. He intended to wield Aanya as leverage, turning her into a pawn in his dealings with Hudson-both a weapon and a ransom demand that could tilt the negotiations in his favor. That revelation brought a new chance.

Days slipped by, and the mood aboard the Odin altered completely.

The casino was stripped bare, no outsiders admitted. Every corner was scrubbed and refitted, the security presence doubled.

Hannah understood exactly what this meant-Hudson himself was on his way. She had already passed the warning to Vincent; now everything hinged on his intervention. In the meantime, she had devised a new plan. When given a short respite from preparing the banquet dishes, she used her knowledge of the galley's layout to slip unnoticed into the concealed passage and return to the bathroom containing Aanya.

The air was staler than before, saturated with the metallic trace of blood and the sourness of damp.

In the corner, a frail shape quivered, shoulders drawn tight. Aanya lay in ruin, scarcely recognizable-her garments shredded, her skin discolored with bruises and open wounds.

At the sound of movement, Aanya recoiled, certain another round of torment was approaching. She folded in on herself, head buried deep, trembling like prey.

But as the steps drew nearer, unrelenting, she sensed something amiss. At last, she raised her gaze, and horror seized her at what she beheld.

"A ghost! A ghost-help me! Someone, help!" Aanya's cry split the room in hysteria.

In Aanya's mind, Hannah had been swallowed by the sea long ago. Her sudden presence could only mean she had clawed her way back as something unearthly.

Hannah advanced until she stood before Aanya, voice cool and measured. "It's been a while, Aanya."

Upon hearing the voice, Aanya's scream abruptly stopped. She gaped in stunned disbelief. "You're still alive? Impossible! I watched them throw you into the sea with my own eyes. How could you be standing here? Are you flesh, or a spirit?"

Crouching low, Hannah let a mocking smile lift her mouth. "I am still breathing. Upsetting, isn't it?" Her fingers caught a lock of Aanya's tangled, filthy hair, lifting it carelessly as she spoke with biting derision."Didn't you declare that my absence would clear the way for you to take my place at Brixton's side? And yet,here you are-broken and discarded.How pathetic."

Aanya shook with rage and humiliation. "Keep away from me, witch! You think this is a victory? You've no idea who my father is. Once he arrives, every one of you is finished! Even Brixton won't be able to protect himself!"

"Is that so?" Hannah's tone cut like a blade. With a sudden tug, she wrenched Aanya's head back, forcing her to face upward. "Look at yourself. Trussed up, helpless. Do you honestly believe your father can appear out of thin air and pluck you out of this?"

She dragged Aanya by the hair toward the porthole.

Beyond it, the endless sea stretched into infinity.

Hannah pressed Aanya's face toward the glass. "My turn for retribution," she whispered close, her words laced with venom. "Tell me, should I let you taste the sea too? Feel the water invade your lungs, robbing you of breath? Wouldn't that be justice?"

Terror cracked Aanya's defiance. "You-you wouldn't dare!"

"Why not?" Hannah's laugh was cruel. Her grip tightened as she leaned in. "This ship has already claimed enough bodies. One more means nothing. Do you think Brixton would mourn you? More likely, he'dthank me for removing the burden. Don't you agree?"
###Chapter 588 Striptease


Aanya's steady façade splintered; she let out a shrill, frantic cry, words tumbling from her lips with raw dread. "If I die, my father will hunt you down! He will gut you alive!"

"Is that the best you can muster? Hollow threats?" Hannah shot back, her tone like winter steel as she seized Aanya's jaw and forced those terrified eyes to lock with hers-eyes that burned with calculated cruelty. "Unfortunately for you, I'm the one holding the power of life and death now, not your father, who's miles away. The one who decides what becomes of you now is standing over you."

Hannah acted as if she were about to hurl Aanya into the sea. Aanya's scream split the air while she clawed and writhed, every muscle straining against the unseen edge.

"Afraid?" Hannah's voice held no mercy. "This is exactly how I felt when you threw me down. Taste that same panic now."

"Don't you dare-let me go! If you throw me, I'll haunt you from the grave!" Aanya wailed, sobs swallowing whatever pride she once wore.

"I have been through a brush with death already. Do you imagine a ghost terrifies me?" Hannah leaned closer, letting her words land like a blade. "By the way, your father is Hudson, right? I hear he's a VIP on this voyage today. Shame he will never know his darling daughter sits helplessly in this dark room."

With that, Hannah abruptly loosened her hold.

Aanya sagged by the window, lungs heaving, her expression a volatile blend of terror and hatred.

Hannah lowered herself until she was level with Aanya, saying leisurely,′′Calm yourself. I won't end you tonight. You don't deserve a swift death. What I crave is a slow unravelling, to savor your collapse."

She paused, as if recalling something. "And didn't you endlessly profess your devotion to Brixton?" she mused. "He told me that he wished you gone. Because his heart belongs only to me. The very sight of you sickens him." This revelation demolished the last of Aanya's defenses. She lifted her head, eyes alight with a poisonous fury.Retribution burned through her veins. Every single person who had ever mistreated her would pay with their lives.

Hannah observed Aanya's reaction, knowing she'd pushed far enough.

She rose, feigning retreat toward the concealed corridor. As she pivoted, a small dagger slid free from the sleeve and struck the floor near Aanya with a metallic ring.

Hannah seemed not to have noticed. Her silhouette melted into the darkness of the passageway.

The hidden door sighed shut behind her.

Huddled on the carpeting, Aanya inched herself forward, wrists raw and bound, fingers fumbling.

At last, her fingertips brushed the dagger's hilt, and she curled her hand around it like a lifeline. She began to saw at the cords with frenzied determination. Freedom. She needed to be free. She would make every person who had mistreated her pay.

Unbeknownst to Aanya, Hannah lingered just inside the passage, breath held tight, ears attuned to the whisper of fraying rope.

A smile ghosted across Hannah's face. Everything unfolded exactly as planned. The blade had been abandoned on purpose. Every cutting comment, every humiliation she had delivered had been arranged to ignite Aanya's fiercest rage.

Hannah had already discreetly moved the nearby patrols away temporarily. Everything was laid out for Aanya.Once Aanya broke loose, Brixton's grip over Hudson would crumble. And in her current state of blinding fury, Aanya would not flee meekly. At a crucial juncture, she might erupt, becoming an unpredictable force poised to wreck the evening and the negotiations.

Satisfied, Hannah did not tarry; she slipped further along the corridor and vanished.

Two hours later, the main salon on the first deck thrummed with gathered guests.

Hannah stood at the edge of the room, eyes on the entrance, certain the esteemed visitor was moments away.

A stir soon rose at the threshold.

Hudson had arrived.

Hannah cast a quiet glance upward and watched a man of middle years enter, flanked by an imposing security detail. His face carried the hard polish of authority and a gaze accustomed to appraisal. His escorts were notably more formidable than the usual contingent Brixton provided.

Brixton pasted on a genial expression and stepped forward to receivehim. "Mr. Chadwick, it is a privilege to have you aboard. Forgive me for not meeting you at the dock. It has been some time, hasn't it?"

Hudson returned the smile and offered his hand in a familiar shake. "Indeed, Mr. Ward. Months have passed since we last crossed paths. I'm eager to see the arrangements you have prepared."

He added with a hint of warning, "You had better make it worth my while."

Brixton's grin refused to falter as he motioned toward the honored place. "Of course. There will be delights to suit you. Please take your seat; dinner awaits."

Under Brixton's direction, Hudson settled into the seat reserved for him.

Brixton clapped his hands.

A procession of women, scantily clad and moving in measured single file, entered, led by Luna.

Only then did Hannah realize why Luna and her troupe had been absent recently-they had been groomed by Brixton for this very spectacle.

Music swelled, and Luna, with the others, launched into an alluring striptease, their gazes heavy with invitation, every motion crafted to entice Hudson.

Hudson watched, brow narrowing, fingertips drumming a steady rhythm on the tabletop; his face remained unreadable. After a stretch, he abruptly lifted a hand to cut the music and fixed his gaze on Brixton."What do you mean by this?"
###Chapter 589 Intense Negotiations


Brixton let out a low laugh, his tone dripping with mockery. "I've long known, Mr. Chadwick, that beauty is something you value highly. Consider this a gesture tailored especially for you-an amuse-bouche before the main course, a small delight meant to catch your interest."

Hudson's lips curved faintly, the shadow of a smirk breaking across his features."Ah, Mr. Ward, you've put a lot of thought into this," he muttered, his voice unhurried, every syllable drawn out as though savoring the taste of irony. "I'll make sure to enjoy it thoroughly."

The music swelled once more, the rhythm shifting, and the dancers pressed their movements into bolder,more provocative shapes.

When the performance concluded, Luna and the others lingered. They did not retreat but rather closed in on Hudson, whispering flirtatious phrases, their laughter airy and coaxing as they tried their best to entice him.

Hudson received them without hesitation, pulling the women close against him. His hands wandered unrestrained, roaming over silken fabric and warm skin, drawing bursts of coquettish giggles from their painted lips.

From her vantage point at the edge of the gathering, Hannah's disdain toward Hudson deepened.Everything unfolding before her only confirmed what she already believed-Hudson was a man enslaved by lust,predictable and shallow.

Brixton measured Hudson's every movement and interjected smoothly,"So, Mr. Chadwick, does this little gift satisfy your expectations?"

Hudson slowly released his hold on the women. Reachìng for a napkin, he wiped his hands with deliberate care, his smile cooling into detachment. He shook his head lightly, his voice carrying sharp dismissal."Tawdry. Cheap. Unworthy. They cannot compare to what you provided before. It seems, Mr. Ward, that your taste has declined.Wouldn't you agree?" For a fleeting instant, Brixton's fixed smile faltered. He dipped his head slightly, his tone suddenly stripped of warmth."So you find them lacking. Then they have no value here."

Turning his gaze aside, his voice became glacial. "Vulture."

"Mr. Ward!" Vulture stepped forward immediately.

"Didn't you hear Mr. Chadwick say he's not satisfied? Deal with it. Cleanly." Brixton's command rang flat,final.

"Understood!" Vulture responded without a flicker of hesitation. At once, several of his subordinates surged forward, seizing Luna and the others with brutal force.

It was only then that the women understood their fate. Their faces drained of color, terror stripping the playfulness from their eyes. Screams burst forth as they struggled wildly, clinging to survival, begging for mercy,casting frantic looks toward Hudson as though he might intervene.

But Hudson merely lifted his glass, savoring a leisurely sip of wine, his eyes never lifting, his expression one of indifferent detachment.

Vulture carried out the order with cold precision. The cries of the women were ignored, their resistance meaningless. They were dragged mercilessly to their doom. Moments later, their bodies disappeared into the dark sea.

The banquet hall froze, silence descending heavy and suffocating.

A chill ran down Hannah's spine, dampening her back with sweat. Her earlier assumptions were shattered.Hudson was not some gullible libertine. His crueIty and indifference surpassed even Brixton's. The entire spectacle had been nothing more than a test.

Hudson remained composed, as though no lives had just been erased. He picked up his napkin and dabbed his mouth with an air of elegance, turning his gaze back to Brixton with asolemn air. "The entertainment is over. Shall wNe now turn to the real matter at hand?"

With that, the mood within the grand hall shifted, taut as a drawn bowstring. Brixton kept his practiced smile, but the gleam in his eyes sharpened. "Mr. Chadwick, isn't that rather hasty of you? We haven't even touched the dishes, and the wine has only just breathed."

Hudson gave a smile that carried no warmth. His fingers tapped lightly against the table, a measured rhythm. "Peace at the table comes only once business is concluded. Otherwise, Mr. Ward, every bite will taste bitter. Don't you agree?"

Brixton inclined his head a fraction, conceding the point with restraint."Very well. How do you propose we proceed?"

He leaned forward slightly, adopting a seemingly conciliatory posture. "To demonstrate my sincerity, the cruise ship's revenue for the year will remain divided sixty to forty. You, of course, retain the forty percent share."

This had been their arrangement for years. Hudson had accepted it before, though reluctantly.

But at Brixton's words now, Hudson's pleasant facade collapsed. His voice cut sharply.′′Areyou joking with me? The majority of patrons onboard are here because of me. Without me, would your offshore casino business be this prosperous? Fairness dictates I take the sixty, and you the forty. That is the only logical split."

Hannah observed silently, realizing she didn't need to stir up any conflict. Greed alone would set these two men against each other, their alliance crumbling over how to split the revenue. When they finally turned their power inward, she and Vincent would seize the moment to free the women locked up on the second deck.

Brixton's eyes turned cold, his voice like steel. "Mr. Chadwick, you wound me with your words. Without me taking the risk to set up this offshore casino, providing the venue, security, and operations, no matter how many connections you have, the money wouldn't be flowing into your pocket. Forty-sixty is already the biggest concession I can make for the sake of our long-standing cooperation. You only provide for your household; I provide for every man risking his life aboard this vessel. Forty-sixty is just."

Hudson gave a derisive laugh, adjusting the cuff of his sleeve with leisurely disdain. "Forty-sixty may be just -but only if the roles are reversed. As a minister of the state, every time l introduce clients to you, l place my career and life on the line. Asking for sixty percent is a reasonable demand, a compensation for therisks I take."
Brixton's words turned to ice. "Your demand is unreasonable to me."

Hudson's expression darkened, final. "Then we have reached an impasse."
###Chapter 590 Vincent's Plan


Hudson lifted his hand with sudden force, and the guards at his back reacted instantly, their weapons drawn in unison, every barrel locking onto Brixton and the loyal men flanking him.

Almost at the same heartbeat, Vulture and his subordinates mirrored the gesture, steel gleaming in their grip as they braced for a violent clash.

The air thickened, charged with peril, the entire hall teetering on the brink of erupting into bloodshed.

Even under the menace of countless muzzles aimed at him, Brixton's composure never faltered. A faint,almost taunting smile curved his lips.′′Mrr. Chadwick, why escalate this into ruin? There's still room for discussion between us. After all..."

He paused deliberately, savoring the silence before dropping his barb."Your treasured daughter is currently a guest on my ship. Wouldn't you like to see her first?"

Hudson's face blanched and then contorted with fury."What? What vile thing have you done to my daughter?"

Brixton, satisfied by the eruption of fear and concern, lifted his hands in mock reassurance. "Calm yourself.She's safe. My men are looking after her well. But..."

His words grew icy, every syllable a threat. "Should you give the order to fire, I cannot assure her safety will last another breath."

Hudson's chest heaved with contained rage. "Hand my daughter over this instant!"

From the side, Hannah's pulse quickened, dread clawing at her. By now, Aanya should have already emerged, just as her plan dictated. Her anxious gaze swept the hall-no trace of Aanya.

At that precise moment, Vulture, his jaw set, leaned close to Brixton and hissed under his breath, "Mr. Ward,we've got a problem. Aanya's gone! She vanished from the bathroom!" The mask of calm shattered on Brixton's face, replaced with a storm-dark scowl. The single card that gave him leverage was snatched away at the critical instant.

Hudson's eyes, sharp as blades, caught the shift in Brixton's and Vulture's expressions. His voice cracked like a whip. "Where is my daughter? Where have you hidden her?"

Just then, a steady, commanding voice rolled through the grand hall from the doorway. "Mr. Chadwick,there's no need to search."

Every gaze snapped toward the entrance.

Vincent appeared at the doorway, advancing with deliberate steps, surrounded by a cordon of elite guards whose disciplined presence drew the room into his orbit. His voice carried calm authority."Your daughter is with me."

The delicate deadlock shattered in an instant with Vincent's arrival.

Hudson's shoulders sagged with a heavy breath of relief as he beheld Vincent.

In the days before, after Hannah's discreet message reached him, Vincent had mobilized every thread of his influence and intelligence to contact Hudson.

After careful probing and verification, Vincent had revealed to Hudson that Aanya was in Brixton's hands.

Though Hudson had carved a career as a ruthless statesman, Aanya, the only daughter he cherished above all, was his single soft spot. Believing her safely studying overseas, he had never conceived of her being caught in Brixton's hands.

Seizing the opportunity, Vincent had proposed a plan during a secret meeting with Hudson the day before the banquet. He'd urged Hudson to feign greed at the banquet and demand greater shares, deliberately provoking Brixton and creating chaos.

In return, Vincent had pledged every resource at his disposal to reclaim Aanya that very day.

Hudson, though burning with desperation to save his daughter, had tempered his response with political caution. He'd accepted, but imposed one stipulation. "I'll play my role, Mr. Jones. But once this ordeal concludes,you must promise me something. We'll settle details later."

Believing it to be a future negotiation of influence or wealth, Vincent had accepted without hesitation.

Vincent's deal with Hudson leaned heavily on unshakable trust in Hannah's ingenuity. He was certain she would contrive an opening to free Aanya amid the banquet's storm. Thus, he had his operatives hidden in the shadows near the Odin, weapons ready, their vigilance unwavering for the moment of Aanya's escape.

And events had unfolded precisely as Vincent had expected. With Hannah's calculated maneuvering, Aanya had slipped free from the bathroom. Once she reached the deck, Vincent's concealed team intercepted her at once. Within moments, she was spirited away under guard to Vincent's vessel, beyond Brixton's reach.

Now, hearing Vincent's declaration and seeing him step forth, Hannah pieced together the entire plan in a flash.

Brixton's eyes narrowed at the sight of Vincent, his brow knotted in displeasure. His scheduled talks with Vincent regarding the port were meant for the following day. His tone dripped with ice as he spat, "Mr.Jones, you're ahead of schedule. Our negotiations aren't until tomorrow."

Vincent met his glare with unflinching serenity. "I haven't got the day wrong. As for the port trade rights,hear me clearly-I refuse them. I will never strike a deal with you."

Brixton's expression soured into venomous rage. He saw instantly that Vincent's appearance was no accident of timing. His gaze flicked toward Hannah, his voice cutting like a blade. "Vulture, take her!"

Vulture lunged at Hannah without pause, his body a blur of violence.

But Hannah was braced for this very strike, having been on high alert. The moment Vulture's hand extended, she slipped aside, fluid as water.

With precise judo technique, Hannah twisted his momentum, redirecting his force and sending him staggering forward in a clumsy stumble. Without hesitation, she spun away and sprinted toward Vincent.

Vincent extended an arm with quiet protectiveness, drawing her safely behind him.

In that instant, Hannah stood beyond harm's reach.
###Chapter 591 That's An Order


Brixton's fury twisted into something so bitter that it nearly broke into a laugh, his stare on Vincent and Hannah heavy with shadow and menace. "Well, well. So you've been playing this game the entire time!Vincent,you knew Hannah wasn't gone!"

In that instant, clarity struck-Vincent's cold dismissal of that corpse, the orchestrated encounter, every subtle detail converging into one undeniable truth: Vincent had known Hannah was alive all along.

At that moment, Hudson surged forward, his glare searing into Brixton. "Brixton, how dare you lay a hand on my daughter! She is the core of my very existence!"

If not for Vincent's assistance and promises that Aanya would be delivered back safely, Hudson-ever the man to balance advantage against risk-might never have severed ties so decisively with Brixton. He might even have bent beneath pressure, conceding to a lopsided split of revenue in the end.

But now, with his daughter's safety assured and his rage stoked by Brixton's holding his daughter as a hostage, Hudson's stance hardened beyond compromise.

Right now, three factions, their forces bristling, were locked in a razor-edge stalemate.

Then, a sudden, jarring crack split the air-someone's finger had touched the trigger."Bang!"

The shot tore open the silence, and the battlefield erupted in flame and frenzy.

Chaos consumed the whole place as the three factions hurled themselves into a violent clash.

Through the storm of gunfire and shouts, Hannah did not hesitate. She cast Vincent a swift look; he caught it at once, rallying his finest fighters to cover her movements.

With precision and urgency, Hannah surged forward, guiding the team away from the blood-soaked fray,cutting straight for the ship's second deck where those women were caged.

Once more, Hannah stood before the long row of barred enclosures, the women inside shrinking back in trembling horror. "Smash the cage locks open!" she commanded without hesitation.

Her men immediately attacked the locks, forcing steel and iron to yield beneath their tools.

The cages swung wide one after another.

Yet, as before, the women did not pour out. Instead, they recoiled deeper into the shadows, clinging to one another, their faces warped with dread greater than ever before.

Hannah's eyes flicked over their terror-stricken forms. She knew that coaxing words were useless here.Drawing in a sharp breath, she hardened her features, her voice snapping like a whip. "Move now! If you hesitate, you'll be hauled out by force! Decide whether you leave on your own feet-or get dragged!"

Her tone dripped with steel and threat.

The women froze,paralyzed by terror, their widened eyes glassy, their bodies convulsing with trembling.

"Must I say it again?" Hannah ripped the dagger from her belt and slammed its blade against the bars, the clang ringing through the chamber.

Survival roared louder than the women's fear. In a surge of sobs and stumbling limbs, they poured from their cages, huddling close, still staring at Hannah with helpless, uncertain gazes.

A wave of relief brushed Hannah, though her face remained ice. She pointed sharply to Nate, who was carving the path ahead, her shout cutting over the din. "Follow him! Any straggler or deserter will pay for it dearly!"

The women obeyed, staggering forward, terror chaining their every step to submission. Inside, they clung to the bleak conviction that this was no rescue, merely another march into a different abyss. Obedience was the only currency they still possessed.

The escape line pressed forward at speed toward their appointed exit.

Hannah took the rearguard, watching every movement, refusing to let her guard drop.

But as they neared the staircase, a sudden cold presence pressed into her lower back. It was the muzzle of a gun. Hannah froze, her body rigid.

Brixton's breath brushed her ear, his voice low and venomous. "Hannah, you're quite capable, aren't you?Getting in touch with Vincent behind my back? Pulling off such a great act right in front of me? Even releasing Aanya? You've become quite the liar."

Silent as a shadow, he had slipped upon her without the faintest sound.

Nate caught the shift immediately. He whirled around, his weapon snapping up to aim at Brixton.

"Nate!" Hannah barked, her voice sharp, her head shaking violently, her eyes flashing urgency. "Take them away. That's an order!"

"But..." Nate's voice trembled with refusal, dread thick in his tone. How could he leave her alone to face Brixton?

"How many times must I repeat myself? Take them and go!" Hannah's words struck like iron, her gaze unyielding.

Nate's eyes darted between Hannah-gun barrel pressing against her-and the huddled mass of terrified women. Finally, gritting his teeth, he wrenched himself to obey, ushering the women down the stairway at a hurried pace.

Brixton did not interfere. His target had never been them. His eyes never left Hannah.
###Chapter 592 Let Her Go


Brixton shoved the barrel of the gun hard against Hannah's lower back, his tone cutting like ice. "You dismissed Vincent's men. Do you honestly believe I'd hesitate to harm you? Do you imagine I'll spare you out of mercy?"

Hannah steadied her breathing, forcing composure. She tried to shift hisfocus. "Brixton, surrender. Look around you-your men are barely standing. Hudson's forces and Vincent's have already locked the field against you."

"Surrender?" Brixton's lips twisted into a dark sneer. "That word has no place in my vocabulary."

"You won't escape today," Hannah replied evenly, her voice firm.

"Oh, I'll escape," Brixton hissed, yanking her closer, his arm clamped like iron as he dragged her toward the third deck. "And you'll be leaving with me. Picture Vincent watching helplessly while I take you away again.Wouldn't that be a sight worth remembering?"

His voice trembled with vindictive delight.

Hannah drew a slow breath, muscles tensing, preparing to use the judo Brixton never knew she practiced.

"Don't move." Brixton instantly caught her shift, shoving the muzzle harder into her lower back, his voice razor-sharp. "My finger's already on the trigger-faster than you'll ever move."

Then, colder still, he spat, "So, you've been hiding tricks. I never suspected you practiced judo."

"There's more about me than you'll ever know," Hannah answered frostily.

Brixton clamped his jaw, refusing further talk, and pulled her along with brutal force until they reached the third deck.

There, Vulture stood drenched in blood, flanked by battered men. A speedboat swung against the hull,ready for flight.
"Mr. Ward! The speedboat's set-we've got to go!" Vulture barked, relief cutting through urgency.His eyes narrowed when he spotted Hannah. "You're taking her? She'll only drag us down!"

"Shut your mouth!" Brixton snapped, the roar harsh and final. "Just carry out my orders!"

Just then, the sharp echo of boots came from behind.

Vincent and his men burst through, weapons raised, their advance unstoppable.

Vincent's gaze locked on Hannah, pressed to Brixton's gun.

"Release her!" Vincent leveled his weapon at Brixton, his stare lethal.

Brixton, still holding Hannah, turned slowly, his smirk mocking. "Mr. Jones-you never disappoint. Quicker than l expected."

Vincent held his fire, straining to rein in the urge to end it instantly. "This ship is under Hudson's control. You have no way out. Let her go, and I'll let you leave on the speedboat. This is your last chance."

Brixton threw his head back, laughter cutting the air like broken glass."Cornered? Me? Never. Threatened by you? Even less!"

He wrenched Hannah tighter, jamming the barrel against her temple."She's coming with me. Vincent, if you've got the guts, pull that trigger."

"If you so much as scratch her," Vincent growled, his knuckles white against the trigger, "I'll rip you apart piece by piece!"

Brixton's smirk deepened. "Empty words. My gun's already kissing her head. You won't risk it, not with her in my hands."

Hannah's mind whirled, her heartbeat pounding, yet her gaze found Vincent's and steadied. She inclined her head subtly and then shifted her eyes downward, signaling her intent.

Vincent caught it instantly. Barely moving his lips, he mouthed a silent order of her kneeling down, sharp as steel. In that split second, Vincent raised his gun and fired at Brixton's right shoulder. Almost simultaneously,receiving the signal, Hannah ducked down.

The bullet searing into his right shoulder, Brixton cried out, staggering, his grip shattered by pain. Hannah twisted free.

But before triumph could rejoice, Vulture lunged. Panic surged in him as he saw Brixton wounded-he shoved Hannah violently toward the open sea.

The force sent Hannah tumbling, her body breaking the water's surface with a splash.

Vincent's face blanched, shock seizing him. In a heartbeat, he dove after her.

"Idiot!" Brixton roared, clutching his shoulder. His fury lashed out. "Who told you to push her?"

Vulture faltered, his voice trembling. "Mr. Ward-the moment was desperate-I had to act! The assets and money are already loaded. If we don't leave now, we're finished!"

Other bloodied men shouted, "Mr. Ward, we have to retreat quickly!"

"Vulture was just panicking. Vincent's and Hudson's men are closing in!"

Brixton's eyes glared with savage fury, and reluctance to leave just yet warred in them. Finally, he ground his teeth and barked, "Retreat!"

His crew scrambled into the speedboat, engines roaring as they fled into the night.

Hudson stormed onto the deck seconds later, troops swarming behind him. His gaze landed on the departing speedboat, fury twisting his features. It was too late to stop Brixton and his crew.

In the freezing waves, Vincent broke the surface, clutching Hannah. She coughed up seawater, her body trembling uncontrollably, but her arms clung to him in desperation.

From a distance, Nate sped toward them in a boat."Mr. Jones! Ms. Scott! Over here-climb aboard!"

As Vincent steadied Hannah in his arms, guiding her carefully toward the approaching speedboat something happened. "Look out!" Nate's eyes tightened, his pupils shrinking sharply as his cry of alarm tore through the air.
###Chapter 593 Infection


Bullets poured down like a wild storm, the air torn apart in a furious frenzy.

In that heartbeat of chaos, Vincent acted without thought-his body became Hannah's shield, the bullet finding his back instead of hers.

A heavy thud followed as a stray bullet hit Vincent squarely in the back. His body convulsed, and blood streamed from the wound, curling red through the seawater.

Realizing something was terribly wrong, Hannah cried out, "Nate, hurry! Pull him up!"

Her arms fought to hold Vincent afloat, though his weight threatened to drag her under.

Even with veins standing out against his temple, Vincent forced a faint smile, as if to steady her heart."Don't worry. I'm fine."

But the weakness in his voice betrayed him.

At last, Nate's boat reached them.

With a surge of willpower, Vincent summoned his last reserves of strength, pushing Hannah onto the deck before himself.

But when his turn came, his arms gave way-blood loss and fatigue swallowed his strength whole. His forehead struck sharply against the boat's edge, and the world collapsed into blackness as his body fell back.

Hannah lunged forward, half her body spilling over the side, her grip tightening on his arm like a lifeline.

Nate bent quickly, catching Vincent's other arm, and together they dragged him aboard.

Once on deck, Vincent's arm instinctively circled Hannah, pulling her close. His whisper was faint but heavy with meaning. "Just now, I almost lost you again." Hannah clung to him, her voice breaking. "We won't be apart anymore."

But already she could feel his warmth fading, and panic pressed against her chest.

The boat carved across the waves, racing toward the Windchaser. The instant they reached the ship,Hannah checked him-his body limp, his forehead burning with fever. He was slipping fast. But no doctor stood among them.

Hudson, who had followed them back, examined Vincent's wounds with grave precision. "Mr. Jones is severely injured. He needs surgery and anti-infection treatment at once. The nearest hospital fit for this is in Agosphia. I can arrange the best specialists there immediately. The decision is yours. At our speed, we'll arrive by dawn."

Nate turned to Hannah, his voice steady but urgent. "Ms. Scott, shall we head for Agosphia?"

Hannah didn't hesitate. "Yes."

Later, Hudson took Aanya with him.

Hannah noticed the way Hudson's eyes flickered toward his daughter-no tenderness, only irritation, even disdain. And Aanya, on meeting his gaze, recoiled like a frightened bird, fear stronger than trust.

It struck Hannah as strange, yet she pushed the thought aside. She gathered her strength instead, working with Nate to properly settle the women rescued from the Odin-providing clean clothes,food,and shelter.

The long night passed with Hannah at Vincent's side, her hand tirelessly pressing a damp cloth to his fevered brow. Still, the fire in him raged on, his wound a constant reminder of the peril he faced.

Finally, dawn broke, and the Windchaser glided into Agosphia's port.

Hudson's contacts awaited them. Vincent was whisked into the capital's finest hospital and rushed into surgery.

As the doors of the operating room closed, Hannah's heart climbed into her throat. Her father had once gone into surgery and never returned-the memory haunted her, turning waiting into pure torment. She couldn't simply sit; idleness felt like a prison closing in. So she busied herself, pushing fear into the 
background.

She checked on the rescued women, pressing money into their hands, enough for a new beginning.

The women looked at her with disbelief, as if freedom itself were too heavy to grasp."You're...truly letting us go? And giving us money?" one timid voice broke the silence.

"Yes," Hannah replied firmly."Use it wisely-start fresh and learn a trade. One thing only: bury the past and live well."

She slipped them a paper with an address. "This is my branch office in Agosphia. If you're lost or need honest work, go there. Mention my name-Hannah Scott. Someone will arrange work for you."

The women were still struggling to process this.

One woman, Sandra Astley, stepped forward at last, having gathered courage. "But before, you threatened to sell us. Why treat us kindly now?"

Hannah's voice softened. "That was an act-to frighten you into following me, so I could get you off that ship. Don't place your trust so easily again. And never let anyone trick you onto a vessel like that."

Sandra's eyes glistened, tears spilling as she choked, "Thank you!"

Her words broke the dam, and the others followed, each offering gratitude.

Hannah said, "There's no need to thank me. I only wish you safety and peace."

When the women were seen off, Hannah returned swiftly to the hospital. The surgery was finished. The doctor informed her that the bullet had been removed, but Vincent's condition remained dire-blood loss and infection held him captive in unconsciousness.

A nurse took the tray that held the extracted bullet. Hannah stared at the cold piece of metal,her heart sinking like a stone into the depths.
###Chapter 594 His True Intentions


Hannah noted that the bullet's design was unlike anything used by Brixton's men or even Vincent's bodyguards. It was smaller, sleeker-almost as though it belonged to a class of its own. A thought struck her like a thunderclap.

At once, Hannah forced herself to recall every fragment from the chaos of the night before...

Once the bullet was securely wrapped, Hannah thanked the doctor and turned on her heel to leave. Her destination was Hudson's office.

A while later, Hudson looked mildly startled when Hannah appeared uninvited. He laid the document in his hand on the desk, leaning back in his chair with casual grace. "Ms. Scott, I expected you would be glued to Mr. Jones's bedside. A bullet wound is hardly child's play-and he suffered it while saving you."

Hannah stood before his desk, gaze unwavering, skipping over courtesy like a stone over water. "Some matters are best discussed face-to-face."

Hudson arched an eyebrow, his lips curving with a flicker of amusement. "Oh? Now you've stirred my curiosity. Ms. Scott, you arrived in such haste-what do you intend to say?"

Her eyes locked on his, and she asked, steady and sharp, "You agreed with Vincent to stage your quarrel with Brixton at the banquet, pretending to be dissatisfied with the profit split, all to provoke Brixton. But that performance had little to do with your daughter Aanya, did it?"

Hudson's smile froze for the briefest heartbeat and then returned as polished as before. His voice carried a hint of displeasure. "Ms. Scott, what are you implying? Aanya is my beloved daughter. She was abducted,tormented-wasn't my fury justified? Her safety remains my first and only concern!"

"Is that so?" Hannah countered with an icy laugh. "If you truly cared for her, why didn't you even show an ounce of concern for her injuries when you retrieved her last night? You never asked if she was in pain, or if she was frightened. Your eyes held nothing but impatience and scorn. And facing you, she was like a frightened doe staring down a hunter, her eyes wide with terror. Is that the bond of a father who genuinely cherishes his child?"

Hudson's expression clouded, his tone hard as iron. "That is simply the unique way I interact with my daughter. I owe no explanations to you. Besides, instead of keeping watch at your beloved's bedside while he clings to life, you come barging into my affairs. Is that not pointless? I have pressing matters to attend to.Please leave me."

"Why drive me to leave already? I've yet to finish." Hannah took a step forward. "It was precisely your cold indifference toward your daughter that aroused my suspicion-and from suspicion came clarity. I see now what you're truly after."

Hudson's jaw tightened, though he quickly smoothed it over, slipping back into the unflappable air of a statesman. He folded his hands on the desk, watching her leisurely. "My true intentions? Ms. Scott, you certainly have a vivid imagination. Pray tell-what could I, the dignified Minister of Economy of Agosphia,possibly be after? Besides, I merely offered assistance. Without my cooperation, could Mr. Jones have rescued you so cleanly and dismantled Brixton's fortress so thoroughly? Ms. Scott, one should have a conscience. Ingratitude is a poison to the soul." His gaze sharpened, fixed like a hawk upon her.

Hannah did not flinch. "You speak of conscience? Yours was swallowed whole by greed long ago.Your quarrel was never about Brixton's forty-sixty split. Your ambition stretches much farther than mere numbers."

She stepped forward, her voice firm as judgment. "Your true target is the Odin cruise ship itself! That is why you struck your bargain with Vincent-pretending it was for Aanya's sake, when in truth, you meant to use his strength to sweep Brixton aside. Once the path was cleared, you could lay claim to that floating empire of fortune. That was your real intention."
###Chapter 595 Are You Sure


Hudson's eyes flickered, betraying a momentary crack in his calm, yet he forced a scoffing laugh. "Don't be absurd, Ms. Scott! Accusations without proof are worth less than dust. Tell me then, what evidence do you have to tie me to that decrepit ship?"

"Evidence?" Hannah's lips curved into a cold sneer."I've already sent people to investigate. The Odin is now firmly in your grasp. Every guard on board has been replaced by your men. Even now, the ship is being redecorated, polished like a stage before its grandopening. Tonight, it is set to welcome business. Tell me I'm wrong, Mr. Chadwick."

Hudson's smile wavered and then vanished like mist in sunlight. For a few long seconds, silence weighed heavy between them. When he finally spoke, his voice cut like steel. "I see l've underestimated you.Vincent's woman is far from just a pretty face. But tell me-did you march in here merely to cast stones at me?"

"Of course not!" Hannah's voice rang sharp, like a blade striking flint. "If this were only about seizing a casino ship, I might dismiss you as just another greedy official. But this-" She slammed a small wrapped object onto the desk. "This bullet exposes you for what you are: a ruthless villain."

Her tone carried no tremor. "This bullet was extracted from Vincent's back. During last night's chaos, I thought Brixton's men had fired the shot. I even suspected the shot had been meant for me. But when l studied it carefully, the truth became clear. Its design proves it was no stray-this was aimed squarely at Vincent. And the shooter wasn't Brixton's man."

Her gaze sharpened, her words deliberate.

Hudson's eyes narrowed, his voice dropping to a dangerous hush. "If not Brixton, then who? Are you pointing that finger at me? Careful, Ms. Scott. Vincent and I are partners. Why would I ever raise a gun to him?"

"It was you!" Hannah's reply was firm, her stare unwavering. "This bullet is no ordinary round-it's custom-made. Brixton's people don't use this type, nor do Vincent's bodyguards. That leaves your men as the most likely culprits. Vincent holds something you covet-the trade rights at Agosphia's port. You knew he'd never hand them over willingly, so you hatched a scheme. First, you feigned alliance, borrowing his strength to crush Brixton. Then, in the turmoil, you struck, wounding Vincent gravely. And afterward, you tried to mask your snare as mercy, pressing to send him to a hospital of your choosing!"

Her words poured like rapid fire, precise and relentless. "You didn't push for Agosphia's hospital because it was the best option-you pushed for it because it was your domain, where every corridor answers to you.Here,you could keep Vincent's loyal guards at bay with one excuse after another, leaving him isolated. That wasn't treatment-it was captivity. You meant to chain him with weakness until he yielded the port rights.Am I right?"

The office sank into a silence so deep that it rang louder than thunder.

Hudson's mask of civility crumbled. Slowly, he began to clap. "Remarkable. Absolutely remarkable! Hannah,you're sharper than l imagined. You've nearly pieced the puzzle together."

Indeed, her guess was right-Vincent's trade rights were the treasure Hudson sought.

"The port of Agosphia belongs to my country," Hudson said, voice rising with conviction. "If not for Vincent's wealth, he never would have touched those trade rights. But I confess-l misjudged him. He proved shrewder than I thought, profiting well from what should never have been his. Naturally, I intend to reclaim the trade rights for my country."

His expression shifted, voice hardening with zeal. "I had thought of playing the long game-letting you stay at his side, watching him sink into despair, perhaps even coaxing him to yield willingly. But now?" He gave a dismissive laugh. "That won't be necessary. You're too clever by half. Keeping you close would be a danger don't intend to court."

His eyes swept over her with an unsettling leisure, as if she were something to be appraised."Still,you are striking. I've heard you once dealt cards with remarkable skill on Brixton's casino ship. Why not trade up and work for me on mine? I'Il offer you terms that make Brixton's look pitiful."

As he spoke, his hand drifted toward the call button on his desk, ready to summon his guards.

But Hannah did not recoil. She did not even flinch. Instead, she leaned forward, closing the distance, her gaze locking his with unnerving calm. Her words came soft but carried the weight of a final trump card.′′Are you sure?"

The steadiness in her voice struck like a paradox-quiet, yet thunderous; calm, yet dangerous.

Hudson froze, his hand suspended in mid-air.
###Chapter 596 She Laid Out Her Requests


Hudson drew his gaze into a thin, assessing slit, taking in the woman who stood before him.

Hannah chose each word with measured calm, as if weighing them on an invisible scale. "It has been twenty minutes since I left the hospital. In another twenty minutes-if Ididn't return unharmed-"

She paused deliberately, her eyes on Hudson's increasingly darkening face, and then continued without hurry, "Anonymously composed messages will wing their way to every prominent political figure across Agosphia and to the editors running the largest mainstream outlets.

Those emails will lay bare the long-standing association between you and the infamous underworld leader Brixton,detail how you have leveraged your position for his benefit, and reveal your shared control over that gambling enterprise-the Odin cruise."

She leaned in a fraction, the air between them charged."Dco you truly imagine you would remain Minister of Economics after that? It wouldn't just be about stepping down-you could find yourself in chains."

The last words carried a metallic edge, her features hardening into granite.

A humorless laugh escaped Hudson, brittle as winter glass. "And you think you alone can topple me? I doubt you possess the means-or the connections-to pull something so vast off."

He hardened his posture and pressed the call button on his desk.

The next second, the office door burst open and a phalanx of guards surged into the room, their stares locked on Hannah with the kind of practiced menace that waited for a single command from Hudson.

Hannah did not flinch; serenity threaded through her words. "Mr. Chadwick, doubt my capabilities as you wish, but you know Vincent's bodyguards-how they operate efficiently without question when given an order."

She paused to let the implication settle. "Before I came here, I told Nate to count down forty minutes.Whether I phone him or not, he will execute my instructions the moment the time elapses. Are you willing to gamble everything on that chance?"

Her statement struck precisely where Hudson's confidence was most brittle. He remembered the clinical efficiency and unerring obedience of Vincent's men.

Silence pooled in the room like oil.

Hudson's features clouded over. In the end, the enormous risk made him hesitate. With the weight of calculation plainly visible in his expression, he signaled his guards to step back.

The guards melted away in disciplined formation, closing the door behind them and restoring a fragile privacy to the space.

Hudson's glare on Hannah was a storm in miniature. "So you actually dare to threaten me?" he demanded,menace sharpening every vowel.

Hannah exhaled, an even, quiet breeze. HHer outward composure never wavered. "This is not a threat, Mr.Chadwick. It is a necessary maneuver to secure both my safety and Vincent's. With him unconscious, you might exploit the situation or resort to coercion-perhaps even to force my signature on papers I would never sign willingly."

She unfolded her conditions like a precise plan. "My requests are straightforward. First, withdraw every one of your operatives from the hospital at once-absolutely no one left behind. Once your people are cleared out, I will not leak the evidence I have collected."

Her eyes narrowed with pinpoint focus. "Second, I insist that the most reputable team of attending physicians of this country assume primary responsibility for Vincent's care. I do not trust the current doctors, who appear to report patient details to you-an arrangement that calls their professionalism into question. Should I learn that remains unchanged, I will return to confront you, Mr. Chadwick,without hesitation."

Hudson's pupils constricted-she had even discovered this? He tried to deny. "How could the doctors be under my influence?"

Hannah's reply was edged with insinuation."Spare me the lies. Before I came here, I overheard the attending physician in the stairwell on a phone call-reporting back to you, Mr. Chadwick. You're more meticulous than I thought, and your reach truly knows no bounds."

Her stare cooled into something that felt like winter sunlight-clear, sharp, unforgiving.

Hudson found himself without a ready retort; further denials would be ineffective. With a sullen expression,he picked up the internal phone and delivered a few curt instructions.

"As you wish." He placed the receiver down and fixed Hannah with a gaze that was all ice."My team will withdraw. The medical specialists will arrive for a consultation shortly. Are you satisfied now?"

"Yes." Hannah inclined her head. "Mr. Chadwick, you are more pragmatic than I expected. I will take my leave now."

She turned without looking back and exited the office. Only when she had stepped out onto the street did she allow herself to release the breath she had been holding. Her palms felt slick; her legs trembled with the aftershocks of adrenaline.

The reason behind her bold confrontation had been simple-she'd sensed danger. Vincent's unconsciousness was the vulnerability. Hudson could, at any moment, harm Vincent or use Vincent as a bargaining chip to force her signature on some documents. She had to act decisively, using a daring move to keep Hudson temporarily in check and secure a safer environment for Vincent. Even so, she knew the respite would not last. Hudson had suffered a significant setback today and would not let it slide easily.

While Hannah measured the fragile victory in her mind, her phone buzzed in her palm-Nate was calling."Ms. Scott! Are you all right? Time's nearly out!" His voice carried the raw edge of urgency.

Hannah answered with steady resolve, "I'm okay. Don't send those emails. Hudson has backed down for now-his people are leaving the hospital. Position yourself outside Vincent's ward to prevent anyone from gaining unauthorized entrance. Vet the new medical team as they arrive and confirm their credentials."

A breath of relief leaked through the line. "Understood, Ms. Scott. Please return quickly. If anything happens to you,we will all be in deep trouble when Mr. Jones regains consciousness."

"I'm on my way." Hannah ended the call, hailed a taxi, and sped back toward the hospital, every muscle primed for whatever came next. 
###Chapter 597 Surveillance


After Hannah's departure, a heavy silence descended on Hudson's office, thick and oppressive.

Baque Dury, Hudson's loyal aide, entered with silent steps.′′Mr. Chadwick, are you truly letting Ms. Scott walk away? She holds dangerous leverage over us."

Hudson's voice remained icy. "Let her go? Not a chance. No one threatens me-least of all her. This is Agosphia.My realm."

He issued orders with sharp precision. "Withdraw our operatives from the hospital where they're exposed.But stay vigilant-double the surveillance secretly. Secure every exit. The instant Vincent regains consciousness, lock the facility down. Not a whisper escapes."

He continued, his tone growing colder, "I doubt the vulnerable Vincent, confined to a hospital bed, dares challenge me then. He'll have no choice but to bend to my terms."

His voice darkened further. "Assign an operative to tail Hannah relentlessly. I want detailed reports-her every step, hercontacts,her schemes."

Baque inclined his head. "Understood. I'll see to it immediately."

Meanwhile, in the hospital room, Hannah stood vigil beside Vincent, who lay motionless on the bed, still lost to unconsciousness.

The doctor,having completed his assessment, delivered a sobering diagnosis. A postoperative infection had taken hold in Vincent's system, fueled by neglected wound care and seawater contamination.

"When will he wake?" Hannah asked, her voice edged with anxiety.

The doctor shook his head gravely. "It's uncertain. It hinges on his response to treatment. If we can curb the infection, if the fever subsides, and his vitals stabilize, he might wake. But there are no guarantees."

Hannah's heart sank as she pressed further. "Given his condition, could we transfer him to another

hospital?"

The doctor's brow creased with concern. "Transfer him? In his state? With an active infection,persistent fever, and the risk of aggravating his condition, it's reckless. Are you trying to save him or endanger him further?"

Hannah asked with measured care, "If the infection is under control, his vitals are stable, and he's improving, would a transfer be possible then?"

The doctor hesitated, weighing the question. "If the infection clears, his vitals remain steady, and he's accompanied by a skilled medical team with proper equipment to protect the wound, then theoretically,yes.But it's still risky, and I'd strongly advise against it."

"I understand. Thank you," Hannah said, storing his answer.

At that moment, Nate returned from his investigation. He reported in a low voice, expression grave. "Ms.Scott, it's confirmed. Unknown vehicles and personnel have been stationed around the hospital long-term,especially at the main entrances and exits. Surveillance is tight. Plainclothes, ordinary cars... Almost certainly Hudson's people. Hudson may have agreed to pull them back, but the hospital is effectively locked down."

Hannah's eyes hardened. "I expected as much. He won't give up so easily."

Nate's jaw tightened. "How about I take a few of our men, find Hudson's people's exact positions, and rough them up? Teach them a lesson-they'll fall in line."

Hannah shook her head, weighing the danger. "No. Hudson's operatives are elite. A frontal clash would alert him and give him a reason to retaliate. Vincent's safety and treatment come first. We can't add more complications."

She paused, resolve sharpening. "But I have a plan. Hudson has rivals in Agosphia's political arena."

She instructed Nate quietly, "Find a way to leak, discreetly and anonymously, pieces of the evidence we have linking Hudson to Brixton, the sea-casino operations, and his plot to detain Vincent just to seize the port-to his political enemy, Sullivan Prescott, the Minister of the Political Department. If Sullivan makes a move, Hudson will be distracted and have less bandwidth to monitor us."
Nate's eyes lit up. "Ms. Scott, that's brilliant. I'Il handle it right away."

"Wait," Hannah said, lowering her voice to reveal the final step. "When Sullivan acts and Hudson is overloaded, that's our window. Arrange a private plane and professional medical escort. Ensure they are ready to go at a moment's notice."

Nate frowned. "Are we transferring Mr. Jones? Didn't you say we must wait until he's stable?"

Hannah's gaze didn't waver. "We're not transferring him. We're taking him straight back to Dorbarrow.That's the safest place."
###Chapter 598 Lost All Memory Of Her


Hannah's tone carried sharp insistence as she pressed on with her reasoning. "We're in Agosphia.Hudson controls this territory. If we linger any longer, his reach will close around us. We must leave before it's too late!"

Nate instantly recognized the alarm in her voice, his expression tightening as he gave a firm nod. "Yes, Ms.Scott! I'll see to it at once!"

Once Nate departed, silence reclaimed the hospital room, leaving only Hannah seated in the stillness beside Vincent's unmoving form. She remained by his side, her hand lightly clasping his fever-warmed fingers,her gaze shadowed by relentless worry.

For days, Vincent had remained trapped in unconsciousness, the fire of his fever refusing to relent. At last,when night had settled thick and quiet, the heat began to ebb.

A faint quiver moved across his lashes before his eyelids gradually lifted. His sight was blurred at first,but little by little, the outlines of the unfamiliar room sharpened before him. Acting on instinct, he shifted, only to let out a groan as searing pain from the wound in his back pinned him down.

"Vincent-you're awake?" Hannah whispered, rousing from her uneasy rest at his side.

The instant she saw his eyes open, joy leapt across her face. She leaned toward him, ready to fold him into her arms in relief.

But before she could touch him, Vincent thrust her back. The abrupt movement tore at his injury, drawing a grimace of pain. His gaze turned guarded, his voice cutting cold. "Who are you?"

Hannah froze, her joy hardening into shock. Vincent no longer knew her?

The depths of his stare carried nothing but distance and dismissal. "I don't care who you are," he continued,his tone like ice. "Get out. Now."

The alien surroundings, the sharp ache in his body, and this unfamiliar woman leaning close all drove his
anger higher. He attempted to rise, but the stab of agony forced him down again, frustration twisting his face. "Did the Jones Group collapse? Why am I in a place like this?"

Watching him strain, Hannah pressed both hands to his shoulders, her voice strained with urgency."Don't move. You've been shot in the back."

Vincent jerked her hand away, his eyes glinting with irritation. "Since when is my life youur concern? Stay out of it!"

The contempt in his glare pierced through her chest, yet she held her ground at the edge of the bed,refusing to let him strain himself. "I said you cannot move!"

Even weakened, his sharp stare radiated a dominance that weighed heavily on the air.

Meeting those hostile eyes, Hannah felt a deep ache hollow her heart. She knew her words could not break through his wall of rejection. Reluctantly, she stepped back, her voice low but steady. "Fine. I won't touch you. But you can't move in this state. I'll fetch the doctor, okay? Just stay put."

Turning swiftly, she left the room at once.

Within moments, she returned, the attending doctor and several nurses following at her heels. They surrounded Vincent, carrying out examination after examination.

Though visibly impatient, Vincent complied, his eyes stayingicy and unreadable throughout.

When the procedures ended, the doctor drew Hannah aside, his expression heavy with concern. Lowering his voice, he said, "Ms. Scott, the symptoms suggest Mr. Jones may be suffering from memory loss."

Though Hannah had braced herself, the confirmation still hit her like a weight, sinking her stomach. Clinging to a fragile hope, she asked quietly, "If he doesn't recognize me, does that mean his memory is fixed eight years back, when he was twenty-three?"

That would have been before they had crossed paths-when his temperament was at its most defiant and unreachable.

The doctor inclined his head. "Considering his confusion about both setting and identity, that seems likely. He recalls being CEO) of the Jones Group, but nothing of the last eight years."

Hannah's brows furrowed. "But the wound was in his back. How could that cause brain injury and memory loss?"

The doctor probed gently, "Did he endure a strike to the head-perhaps a fall or a blow?"

At once, memory surged back-Vincent's head slamming against the sharp edge of the speedboat before he had fallen unconscious. Her voice quickened."Yes-he struck his head!"

"Well, that clarifies it," the doctor said gravely. "The scan shows minor cerebral bleeding. The hemorrhage presses against the memory center, producing selective amnesia."

Hannah's voice trembled with urgency. "Can it heal? Will the blood clear?"

The doctor let out a weighty sigh. "That is uncertain. Absorption differs for every patient. If the blood resolves quickly, his memory could return within one to three months. But if not, it may never return."

The possibility that his memory of her might be lost forever sent an icy chill coursing through Hannah,her entire body numbing.

In a haze, she walked back toward his hospital room-only to stop short. The bed was empty. Vincent was gone! Terror jolted through her chest like a knife. Where could he have vanished, still fever-weakened and wounded? Had Hudson's men already seized him?
###Chapter 599 Doubts


Hannah burst out of the hospital room in a rush, desperation tightening her every step as she seized upon the nurses in the corridor, her voice urgent and trembling. She pleaded to know if anyone had seen Vincent,but the bewildered faces and shaken heads around her offered nothing.

At that moment, Nate appeared, slightly breathless, as though he had hurried from another wing of the hospital. "Ms. Scott, I've finally managed to locate you."

Hannah clutched his arm with frantic force, her tone sharp and quivering with fear. "Nate, Vincent has vanished! You need to send people after him this instant. He just regained consciousness, he's injured, and we can't risk him wandering into danger!"

Nate raised a hand, striving to temper her panic. "Please, Ms. Scott, calm yourself. Mr. Jones hasn't gone missing."

Her brow furrowed in disbelief, her voice brittle with tension. "Then tell me where he went."

Nate's expression faltered, a mixture of frustration and confusion weighing on him. "After Mr. Jones woke up, he became strangely restless. The moment he realized he was in Agosphia, he seized the hospital room's telephone to contact his branch manager. He insisted on leaving immediately to handle urgent business negotiations, declaring he couldn't waste another moment."

Pausing, he continued, "The local staff, unaware of his condition, could not deny an order from the CEO.They prepared a vehicle for him without delay. By the time I reached the hospital room, the car had already departed.I stayed behind so you would not be left in the dark."

His tone dwindled into a hushed murmur as he finished.

Hannah's eyes narrowed in frustration, her mind racing. She understood in that instant-Vincent's memory was indeed frozen eight years ago, when he had only just inherited Jones Group, driving himself ruthlessly in pursuit of global expansion, fearless in risk and blind to consequence. But the present was no time for boardrooms or deals. Hudson's men lurked in the shadows like vultures circling prey. Going out so "This is madness!" Hannah exclaimed, her voice breaking with urgency and fury. "He's lost his memory and doesn't know how dangerous things are. We must bring him back at once."

Nate stood momentarily stunned, the words striking him like a blow. Vincent had lost his memory? The thought staggered him. But he caught himself quickly and answered with resolve, "Yes, Ms. Scott!"

Meanwhile, Vincent sat in the back of the branch car, his expression marred with impatience. He tugged irritably at the rough hospital gown clinging to him, his discomfort plain. Scowling, he barked an order at the bodyguard who had taken the wheel, "Forget the branch office. Take me to the nearest luxury tailor."

The bodyguard faltered, hesitant. "But, Mr. Jones, your wounds-"

"Do as I instructed!" Vincent cut in coldly, his voice low and commanding.

Even weakened, the authority radiating from him was undeniable, leaving the bodyguard no room to object.
With a quick nod, he turned the car toward the tailor.

At the boutique, Vincent grimaced with each motion, yet he moved decisively through the racks, selecting a tailored suit that spoke of power and poise.

Once dressed, the mirror reflected a man steadier, his pallor partially veiled beneath fine fabric.

But the act of dressing pulled sharply at the healing wounds across his back, leaving him stiff with pain and frustration.

Turning sharply to the bodyguard, Vincent's eyes narrowed like blades. "Explain these injuries. Who dared lay hands on me?"

The bodyguard stiffened, unnerved by the icy demand. "Mr. Jones, you don't recall? You sustained them protecting Ms. Scott."

"Ms. Scott?" Vincent's brow furrowed, his mind flashing to the woman who had approached him in the hospital room. "Hannah Scott?"

"Y-yes," the bodyguard stammered, unsettled by his employer's strange detachment. Vincent let out a derisive laugh. "Protect that woman? Why would I risk myself for such a thing?"

He had already been aloof, his attention solely on work, never on love life. He doubted he had any romantic feelings toward Hannah, let alone put his safety aside just to protect her.

The bodyguard swallowed nervously, baffled by Vincent's tone, yet too afraid to ask what was wrong."Because you've been pursuing Ms. Scott."

Vincent's head snapped toward the bodyguard, eyes blazing. "Pursuing her?" His voice dripped incredulity,sharpened with anger. "Utter nonsense."

The very thought was absurd. He, Vincent Jones, reduced to chasing after a woman? The notion was laughable,insulting.

The bodyguard, paling under the storm brewing in Vincent's gaze, scrambled to clarify, words tumbling clumsily. "Mr. Jones... Ms. Scott is not just anyone. She is your former wife. Since the divorce, you've been trying to win her back. When she was taken, you risked everything, even following her into the open sea.Everyone who witnessed it was deeply moved."

As the bodyguard's explanation faltered into uneasy silence, Vincent's face hardened into shadow.Ex-wife?That stranger from the hospital was his ex-wife? His tone dropped, cold and razor-sharp. "You'd better explain this clearly. What's going on?"

Vincent's mind recoiled. His memory offered nothing of marriage, let alone divorce. He had always been single-when would he have bound his life to someone else's?

The bodyguard, slick with sweat, wondered if he was being tested, his loyalty balanced on a knife's edge.With trembling hands, he dug out his phone, thrusting it forward. "Mr. Jones, I'm not lying... Look. These are news articles and photos about your marriage, divorce, and pursuit to win her back. They all confirm it."

Vincent seized the device, scanning rapidly. His sharp gaze landed on a headline above a familiar image:Jones Group CEO Vincent Honors Grandmother on Her 80th Birthday.
###Chapter 600 He Knew About His Memory Loss


Vincent's gaze contracted at the headline, shock rippling across his features. His grandmother-celebrating her eightieth birthday? Impossible. In the recesses of his recollections, she had only reached seventy-two.Eight years still stood between her and that milestone.

Then,his attention shifted to a picture-his grandmother arm in arm with a younger woman, her laughter frozen in the captured moment. That woman was Hannah. The two looked inseparable, their smiles radiating an almost familial intimacy.

Vincent's grip tightened imperceptibly around the phone, the expression on his face flickering through unsteady shades of emotion. The warmth between his grandmother and Hannah forced him to reckon with the bodyguard's statement-it might actually be true. And yet, his mind held no trace of it. There was only one possible conclusion. He had lost an entire eight years of memory.

In those vanished years, not only had he married Hannah and severed the bond, but here he was again,chasing after his former wife, recklessly enough to put his life on the line. The absurdity of it struck him as nearly comical, though no laughter escaped.

But Vincent's trained instincts, sharpened through years of ruthless business, quickly snapped back into place, steadying him as he sifted through the chaos. Eight years erased meant the landscape around him-alliances, enemies, personal ties-had turned into uncharted ground, bristling with danger.

Then,he caught sight of a formation of sleek black vehicles approaching. "Whose men are those outside?"he asked icily, his voice edged with readiness for confrontation.

The bodyguard glanced over, his demeanor instantly taut. "Mr. Jones, those men belong to Hudson Chadwick. He's been targeting the trade rights to the Agosphia port under your control. Ever since your injuries and hospitalization, they've been circling, waiting for you to wake up."

Vincent searched through the fragments of his intact memories. Eight years ago, the Agosphia port had barely reached the initial stages of development, negotiations still distant. Clearly, the project had expanded enormously in the interim, its stakes high enough to attract wolves. His expression hardened, sharp and glacial. No one would strip him of what was his.

Just then, the vehicles slowed to a stop before the entrance.

A figure emerged, surrounded by his entourage-it was Hudson. He ordered staff and customers out of the luxury boutique with ruthless efficiency, until only Vincent, his bodyguard, and Hudson's subordinates remained in the echoing space.

Vincent's bodyguard's hand lingered discreetly near his holster, his entire framerigid with vigilance.

Though memory loss clouded his mind, Vincent's authority in moments of peril remained untarnished,his presence commanding the air. With the faintest flick of his hand, he signaled the bodyguard.

Catching the meaning instantly, the bodyguard retreated a step, angling himself behind Vincent as he transmitted their coordinates to Nate using a specialized communicator.

Hudson feigned obliviousness, plastering on a smile too practiced to be genuine. "Mr. Jones, what a relief to see you awake! I've hardly slept these past days, worrying over you."

Vincent ignored Hudson, adjusting his suit cuffs with deliberate leisure, though there was nothing to smooth. Only after a long silence did he raise his head, eyes sweeping coldly over Hudson and the men flanking him. "Worried about me? You have a peculiar way of expressing concern. Gathering this crowd-do you fear I'll strike you, or intend to strike me yourself?"

Hudson's mask slipped briefly before he covered it with an easy laugh."Ah, Mr. Jones, you still have a sense of humor. More company, more energy, yes? It shows how seriously I take this."

He shifted to the main point. "We had an arrangement, didn't we? I help you deal with Brixton, and you promised to fulfill a condition for me afterward. A promise is a promise."

Vincent's mind held no memory of such terms, yet outwardly, he betrayed nothing, reclining slightly as his tone cooled. "Don't beat around the bush."

He meant to prompt Hudson to speak plainly.

Hudson chuckled stiffly, attempting to ease the edge. "Straightforward as ever-far less roundabout than your girlfriend, Ms. Scott."

Vincent's stare grew cold, ice radiating from the warning in his voice. "Leave irrelevant names out of this.Just state your demand."

Hudson dropped the polite veil, hunger in his eyes. "Very well. I want exclusive trading rights and a share of the profits from the deep-water port in my country-the one you command."

Vincent's lips curved in the faintest, disdainful smile. Even robbed of eight years of memory, he grasped the sheer weight of what Hudson sought. But he met the greed with calm precision, his tone smooth and cutting. "Mr. Chadwick, you certainly have a keen eye. Yet, what you ask for is far from modest."
###Chapter 601 Threat


Hudson assumed he might have a deal. Hopeful, he leaned forward. "Put a figure on the table. If it's fair, I won't haggle," he said, trying to sound casual.

Vincent shook his head, eyes narrowing with a predator's precision. "Don't bother naming a sum. Let's swap assets instead. I will bargain over the port's trade privileges-but what I ask for in exchange will cost you something that actually matters to you."

Hudson's voice turned guarded. "What are you asking for?"

Vincent answered with slow deliberation, "I want the exploitation rights to that large, newly discovered oil field in the north of Agosphia. In return, I'll hand over a share of the port's trade rights."

The color left Hudson's face in an instant. He had known Vincent wouldn't yield easily. Still, Vincent's audacity in demanding that oil field astonished him. That oil field wasn't just land and crude; it was a linchpin for his political future and a cornerstone of his long-term influence. He could not possibly let it go.

"Absolutely not," Hudson snapped, his voice hardening. "Vincent, you need to understand the situation.You're gravely wounded, and this place is my domain. It's my advantage here. You're allowed to remain here only because I'm willing to parley-otherwise, not only will you lose the port's trade rights, but you might not even make it out of Agosphia alive."

His words were a naked threat.

Vincent's stare chilled the air. "Threats have never been something I've tolerated," he said, voice like ice.

Hudson ignored the remark, snatching a prepared contract from a subordinate and slamming it onto the table. "Cut to the chase. Sign this transfer for the port's trade rights. I'll even sweeten it-fve hundred million dollars compensation. Walk away and keep your life; refuse, and don't dream of leaving."

Hudson flicked a glance, and his subordinates closed in, hands at their weapons.

Vincent didn't look at the contract. Earlier,while Hudson spoke, Vincent had retrieved a private phone and worked it with unnerving focus. A stark command interface flashed across the screen as he typed a compact sequence of instructions.

The whole transaction took a handful of seconds. Vincent set the device face down and put it away as if nothing had happened. He lifted his gaze and spoke with unruffled calm. "Mr. Chadwick, before you offered to negotiate like this, did you check the simplest of hazards?"

Hudson frowned. "What are you talking about?"

Vincent's tone dropped, steady and severe. "Did you really expect I'd sit idle and leave my fate to you?"

At that moment, a subordinate behind Hudson glanced at his own phone and went pale as paper. He nearly lunged toward Hudson, whispering hoarsely into his ear, "Mr. Chadwick, several of our overseas secret accounts are under attack-funds have been siphoned. The method matches techniques associated with the Jones Group."

Eyes wide with disbelief, Hudson stared at Vincent as if the floor had shifted beneath him.

Vincent adjusted his cufflinks with a faint,contemptuous smile. "Technology is really remarkable, you know?One precise instruction can short-circuit endless bureaucracy. The Jones Group holds some sway inside major banks worldwide. Our liquidity dwarfs the treasuries of many small nations."

He let his eyes rake over Hudson's blanched face, tightening the noose. "And don't forget the shell companies registered under your name for laundering, and the properties you've tucked away with your overseas mistress... Imagine all that information landing on Agosphia's Anti-Corruption Committee desk tomorrow-how long do you think your political life would survive?"

Each phrase made Hudson whiter; sweat gathered at his temples. He'd once been sure he had left no trace behind, his illegal dealings buried deep.

"But... How did you move so fast?" Hudson's voice broke, panic seeping in as he realized his miscalculation.Vincent was no lamb to be led.

Vincent regarded the now-frantic Hudson with absolute command. "Hudson, those who flirt with danger end up scorched." He plucked up the port transfer contract, tore it neatly in two, and tossed the pieces into the trash. "If you want the port," he said,bring real strength and meaningful leverage. These petty, underhanded maneuvers only underline how desperate you are."

Without another look at Hudson's ashen features, Vincent turned and walked away. His bodyguards stepped forward to clear his path.

Hudson watched Vincent's resolute back and then the steady stream of asset-freeze alerts scrolling across his phone. He forced himself into action. "Stop!" he barked, producing a concealed pistol with a practiced motion, the chamber clicking as he cocked it, and he leveled the weapon at Vincent.

"Since you refuse to yield, I won't let you leave Agosphia alive," Hudson declared. "A few foreign bodies won't raise eyebrows here. Once you're dead, the port will become ownerless, and I will take it."

With his back to Hudson, Vincent did notflinch. A lethal focus sat behind his eyes as he measured the distance, muscles tightening, prepared to disarm and respond.

But just as Vincent was about to act, a voice called out."Stop!"
It was Hannah, who'd just arrived at the doorway.
###Chapter 602 Saving Her Man


The crowd's attention shifted as Hannah stepped through the doorway, her movements deliberate, a small entourage trailing close behind.

Vincent froze mid-reach, his fingers hovering over the gun he'd been about to grab. He'd expected Nate storming in with the backup team-reinforcements.

But when the door creaked wider and Hannah's silhouette came into full view, a sharp frown cut across his face. A ripple of irritation coiled in his chest. Why Hannah, of all people? And what the hell did she think she was doing here? With only a handful of people around her, all looking completely ordinary, it seemed as though she'd walked straight into a death trap. Was she here to throw her life away? Utterly foolish.

In Vincent's eyes, women belonged far from danger-her sudden appearance now was nothing short of reckless interference.

Hudson blinked in surprise when he saw Hannah and then erupted into a mocking laugh. "Ha-ha, Hannah.What a touching sight-rushing here to die alongside your man. How romantic," he sneered, his voice dripping with malice. "Fine then, I'll grant your wish!"

With a sharp wave of his hand, he barked out the order, "Kill them!"

But his men stood motionless, ignoring his command as if they hadn't heard a word.

Rage flared in Hudson's eyes as he turned around and shouted, "Are you all deaf? I said kill them! Do you no longer care about the money I promised to pay you?"

Yet still, none of them lifted a finger. One by one, they slid their guns back into their holsters, stepped aside,and lowered their heads in silece.

Before Hudson could erupt again, a firm, authoritative voice rang out from behind Hannah. "Mr. Chadwick,are you disregarding even the President now?"

The words struck Hudson like thunder. His breath hitched as he whipped his head around-only to see his political adversary, Sullivan, entering the room alongside a composed, middle-aged man radiating power.

The middle-aged man was none other than Manas Fernandez-the president of Agosphia.

The President's presence explained why Hudson's men no longer obeyed him.

Cold sweat rolled down Hudson's temples as his voice faltered. "M-Mr. President... Sullivan... What brings you here?"

Hannah stepped forward, her expression calm yet unyielding. "I invited the President and Mr. Prescott."

When she'd received the emergency signal from the bodyguard, she hadn't wasted time rushing to the boutique. Instead, she'd told Nate to drive straight to Sullivan's residence.

The meeting had been tense-Sullivan, wary of a stranger showing up in the dead of night, had been openly skeptical.

But Hannah hadn't minced words. She'd laid her cards on the table right away: she wanted to join forces with him to bring down his rival, Hudson.

She'd discreetly revealed to Sullivan that the anonymous evidence exposing Hudson's collusion with Brixton had come from her. And in her possession, she held even more explosive proof-evidence so conclusive that it could bury Hudson completely.

The temptation of crushing a rival and gaining immense benefits had finally swayed Sullivan to her side.

Yet, Hannah had believed their plan lacked absolute certainty. Determined to seal every loophole, she pushed for a bolder move-urging Sullivan to leverage his influence and summon the President to the scene in person. Only the President's direct intervention could guarantee that nothing slipped through the cracks.

At the same time, Hannah had set a contingency plan in motion, reaching out through Sullivan's network and bringing in reporters from Agosphia's most reputable media outlets. So when she arrived just now, the people at her back weren't armed enforcers-they were reporters ready to expose the truth. Their mission was to use miniature cameras to stream the entire confrontation live to every household across Agosphia.

With a steady voice, Hannah faced the lens squarely and began her public exposé-laying bare Hudson's abuse of authority, his years of collusion with an underworld leader, and the illegal gambling ship, Odin,which he shielded while funneling clients to it and pocketing staggering profits.

"Hudson's corruption has dragged the name of the Agosphian government through the mud," HHannah declared with unwavering conviction."All of this is being broadcast live by these reporters. Every citizen in Agosphia is hearing the truth right now."

A sheen of cold sweat broke across Hudson's forehead. Panic twisted his features as he shouted hoarsely,"Lies! It's all lies!" Clinging to desperation, he turned to Manas. "Mr. President, don't trust her! She's working with Vincent-she made all this up just to save him! It's all lies!"

Hannah regarded his flailing protests with an unnerving calm. "If you're innocent, a quick audit of your accounts will show it-no unexplained transfers, no offshore deposits. And that gambling ship-who's its real owner now?" Her gaze sharpened. "Tell me, Hudson, do you think you can survive an investigation?"

Vincent's eyes lingered on Hannah's face, surprise flickering across his usually impassive expression. He'd underestimated her. Beneath the quiet composure, she clearly knew how to turn the game in her favor.

Before Hudson could recover, Manas stepped forward, his,voice hard as iron. "Hudson Chadwick," he demanded,"what do you have to say for yourself?"
###Chapter 603 Bringing Down Hudson


Hudson jerked his head upward and bellowed, his voice like a wild beast breaking free, "What fault lies in my actions? Every move I made was for the glory and endurance of Agosphia. Sacrificing a handful of lives is nothing when weighed against the nation's progress. Their deaths serve the country; it should be counted as their highest honor. It is you, with your obstinate defiance, who stand in the way of Agosphia's rise.You-you are at fault!"

Sullivan's complexion drained as fury overtook him, and with no interest in further debate, he snapped, "You wretched madman! Folks,take him!"

The instant the words "take him" were spoken, a hardened light flickered in Hudson's eyes.He thundered back, "Don't trouble yourselves. I'll finish this by my own hand."

Before the echoes of his vow could fade, he sprang with startling speed at a nearby subordinate, ripping the pistol straight from the subordinate's belt.

All who watched assumed he meant to shoot himself and end everything in one final act of repentance.

But in the very next heartbeat, the weapon swung sharply, barrel locking directly onto Manas.

Hatred ignited in Hudson's glare as he spat venom through clenched teeth, "It's you who deserves to die,Manas Fernandez! Worthless fool-you're unfit for that throne! Get out of my sight forever!"

He pulled hard on the trigger.

A thunderous crack split the air. Yet, the shot had not erupted from Hudson's weapon. The bullet had come from Vincent's bodyguard, faster than anyone else could react.

A burst of blood erupted from Hudson's wrist, the firearm clattering uselessly to the floor as his shriek of agony rang out.

From the very instant Hudson seized the weapon, Vincent had turned to his bodyguard and conveyed his silent order. The bodyguard had executed the command with ruthless precision. Cold perspiration broke across Sullivan's brow. He barked furiously,"Bind him! Restrain him at once!"

The guards swarmed like a tide, forcing Hudson to the floor and shackling him without mercy.

When the danger passed, Sullivan and Manas strode to Hannah, admiration written plainly across their faces.

"Ms. Scott," Sullivan declared with genuine reverence,"you faced peril without faltering and handled the situation with meticulous care. Truly commendable!"

Manas inclined his head, his voice softened with gratitude. "Ms. Scott, you have removed a grave threat from Agosphia and averted calamity. In the name of our government, I extend our deepest thanks."

Hannah received their accolades without the faintest arrogance. With a measured nod, she answered with cool restraint, "Your words are too kind. I merely acted as necessity required."

Manas shifted toward Vincent, whose stern silence held the room in check, and spoke with deliberate warmth. "Mr. Jones, you have endured an ordeal beyond words. Once this matter is resolved, we'll hold a banquet to properly express our gratitude to both you and Ms, Scott."

Recognizing refusal would only complicate the moment, Hannah spoke swiftly before Vincent could object."We are grateful for your generosity, Mr. President. Once peace returns, we shall be honored to attend."

With heavy responsibilities awaiting, Manas and Sullivan traded final courtesies with Hannah before departing with their retinues. The reporters, their broadcast concluded, also withdrew in orderly fashion.

The moment the crowd dispersed, Vincent pivoted toward Hannah, his tone edged with displeasure."Who permitted you to accept that invitation on my behalf?"

Hannah met his cutting stare without flinching, calmly countering, "I accepted it for us, not just for you."

She didn't linger on his objection. Stepping forward with brisk resolve, she extended her hand to reach for his. "This is no time for quarrels. We must leave immediately."

Vincent's brows knitted in a sharp frown. He shook her hand off with deliberate force, his gaze icy enough to wound. "Do not touch me." A pang stabbed through Hannah's chest, but she stilled her turmoil, answering softly,"Very well, I won't.Nate has already secured a private jet and medical team. Hudson may have fallen, but his loyalists will likely cause chaos.Agosphia is about to erupt-we must escape at once."

Vincent studied her, the frost in his expression thawing slightly, though suspicion lingered."My men-they seem to heed you now more than me."

Her reply was steady, patient. "They aren't obeying me, Vincent. They are prioritizing your safety. Leaving is the only logical course, and no one understands that better than you."

He did not argue further, though his tone remained clipped. "I may have lost fragments of memory, but my mind and judgment are intact."

He could not deny what he had seen. This woman had outmaneuvered an adversary with remarkable acuity,exposing weaknesses, bending power to her will, marshaling even the media and the presidency itself. In doing so, she had not merely dodged a bullet-she had utterly dismantled her enemy. Such quick thinking and fearless action belonged not to the ordinary, but to the exceptional.

Hannah hesitated as his awareness of his memory lapse dawned on her. She then urged swiftly,"Since you understand, let's hurry. Tonight, Agosphia will undoubtedly shatter into unrest. It's the best time for us to leave."

Vincent strode toward the exit, his steps unyielding. As he passed her, he did not stop and only delivered a detached remark. "Sharp mind, decisive hand. You would make an excellent team member in the field."

Hannah froze where she stood. Watching his retreating figure, cold and impersonal, business carved into every line, disappointment tore at her. She swiftly buried the ache deep and then hastened to close the distance between them. Her voice rang firm and unyielding. "But Vincent, I have no wish to be your team member."
###Chapter 604 Shall We Talk


Vincent froze mid-step, his eyes narrowing as an unmistakable frown darkened his features.

Hannah held his gaze with unwavering determination, her voice steady and deliberate."What I want is to be your wife."

His brow creased further, a hard chill settling into his expression as though a shadow had passed over his heart.Without exchanging another word, he turned and strode forward, each step long and purposeful.

Hannah stood rooted to the spot, her eyes fixed on his retreating form, a strange sense of déjà vu washing over her.

It reminded her painfully of the time, years ago, when she had first mustered the courage to chase after Vincent. Back then, she had been unrelentingly bold, impervious to his icy rejections, charging ahead with fearless resolve.

Perhaps it had been the vigor of youth, or the raw, untainted force of her love. The pain she felt then had been sharp, yet it was accompanied by a naïve courage that only grew stronger with each denial.

Now, though her bravery remained, it carried a weight-her heart ached, her resolve trembling under the strain of his indifference. She worried more deeply, feared with greater intensity that he might never reclaim memories of her again.

Yet, despite his lost memories and the cold barrier he maintained, her pulse still raced uncontrollably whenever their eyes met. She still loved him. That truth both bothered and emboldened her, stirring a quiet,resolute flame within her.

Without hesitation, she hurried after Vincent. What did it matter that his memories were gone? She would pursue him again, just as she had before. Only this time, she hoped the chase would not stretch endlessly.Eventually, Hannah, Vincent, and their companions reunited with Nate and boarded the sleek private jet.

The aircraf glided through the sky, yet inside the cabin, the air was thick with tension, suffocating in its

intensity.

Vincent closed his eyes, attempting rest, but the deep furrow between his brows betrayed the discomfort his back wound inflicted.

Hannah maintained a vigilant, quiet watch over him, her concern unspoken. After a moment, she broke the silence, her tone measured and businesslike as she checked the time. "It's time to change your bandages.Leaving them as they are could lead to infection."

She approached with the medical kit in hand, ready to help, but Vincent shifted away just as her fingers reached for him. His gaze seemed distant, almost detached, and his voice carried a flat, cold edge.-"Ifmy bodyguards aren't lying, we're divorced now, aren't we?"

A sharp pang shot through Hannah's chest, and she pressed her lips together before quietly admitting,"Yes."

His eyes swept over her with calculating detachment. "Then, as an ex-wife, shouldn't you maintain some distance? Is it really proper for you to get this close?"

Anger and pain bubbled inside her, but she clenched her jaw, swallowing her emotions, reminding herself that arguing with a patient-especially one suffering memory loss-would achieve nothing.

She handed the supplies to Nate, who tried his best to remain unobtrusive. Her voice hardened,commanding yet controlled. "Fine, we'll maintain distance. Nate, you handle his bandages. If his wound becomes infected, the consequences will be severe."

Nate took the items cautiously, as if holding a live ember, and braced himself.′′Mr.Jones,|-"

Before he could finish, Vincent's piercing glare cut him off."Nate, think carefully. Who employs you? Who signs your paychecks?"

Caught in an impossible position, Nate froze, sweat beading at his temple, questioning why he bore the brunt of Vincent's amnesia.

Hannah,witnessing Vincent's frigid demeanor, felt her own irritation flare. She crossed her arms, squared her shoulders, and confronted him with sharp conviction."Vincent, even if your memory has failed you, can't you distinguish right from wrong? Recklessly endangering yourself is childish."

Without warning, she leaned in, placing her hands firmly on the armrests of his seat and trapping him in a confined space. Her face hovered close, a playful glint in her eyes. "Or are you simply shy? Nervous about me looking at your back?"

The unexpected closeness caused Vincent to stiffen, his gaze flickering involuntarily to her lips as his Adam's apple shifted under the tension.

The next instant, as if burned, he pushed her back abruptly and shot to his feet, his voice edged with irritation. "Who gave you permission to get this close?"

Hannah,undeterred, straightened gracefully and raised an eyebrow."And who told you to make such a fuss over a bandage change? Are you always this difficult?"

She turned her gaze to Nate, silently signaling him to proceed with the bandage change.

Vincent finally sank back into his seat, a dark shadow crossing his features. He offered no refusal, though the room remained taut with tension.

Nate worked carefully, changing the bandages and applying the medicine to Vincent's back, aware of Vincent's icy, unyielding aura throughout the process.

Once finished, Nate withdrew with visible relief.

Hannah, observing Vincent's continued grim expression, spoke up gently yet firmly."Now,shall we talk?"
###Chapter 605 How Could You Fail To Protect Even A Baby
Vincent lifted his eyes to Hannah, his gaze deep,unreadable-like a locked chest that refused to reveal its contents. Oddly enough, he shared the same gnawing thought. Amnesia was a merciless thief; it stripped him of controI, and nothing unsettled him more than being at the mercy of uncertainty.There were answers he needed-fast-if he was to wrestle back command over his life.

He sat across from her, his very presence stretching across the space like an invisible wall of authority. He instinctively took charge of the conversation, his voice sharp as a gavel. "I'll ask, and you'll answer."

Hannah gave a small nod. "Alright.Go ahead."

His first question cut straight to the bone. "Why did we get married in the first place?" To him, marriage was a tiresome snare, a complication he would never willingly step into. He couldn't fathom why he had once chosen otherwise.

Hannah hesitated only a beat before replying,"Because you thought it was appropriate."

Vincent's brow tightened. That answer felt flimsy-almost absurd. He pressed on. "But from what l know, you only built up the Luminara Group after our divorce. And your parents... They're just high school teachers."

That much he'd gathered from his bodyguards.Nothing about her background fit his notion of "appropriate."

Hannah met his stare calmly and revealed the missing piece. "Because your grandmother liked me.You believed that marrying a woman your grandmother adored could make your life simpler.That was what made marrying me perfectly appropriate."

Her words struck true. They matched the weight his grandmother carried in his memory, and mirrored his own dislike for trouble, his craving for efficiency. His doubt thinned. He gave a small nod. That reasoning held water. Making concessions for his grandmother was exactly the sort of compromise he would make.

At once, another question rose in his mind-a sharper one, one that might explain why he had once clung so tightly to his ex-wife. He leaned forward."After all those years of marriage, did we have children?"

To him, the idea of a child made sense of everything.If there had been one, then his wish to reconcile was clear as day: he wanted to give that child a whole family.

The sudden question caught Hannah unprepared.Her body stiffened. A sorrow, raw and unhidden,flickered through her eyes. She lowered her lashes.After a pause heavy as stone, she whispered a single word,"Yes."
Vincent felt a flicker of hope creep into his eyes-an emotion he wasn't even awar e of. It aligned with his
 assumption. "A boy or a girl?" he asked.

Hannah raised her gaze, catching that fragile spark of anticipation in him. It gripped her heart like a cold hand, squeezing the air from her lungs. Her fist clenched. "The gender was unknown. I... I lost the pregnancy after just over a month."

Vincent's brows snapped together. "How could you fail to protect even a baby?"

The words pierced her like a blade twisted in an old wound. Her long-buried grief and fury broke their chains, rushing out all at once. She lifted her head.Her eyes burned red, tears threatening but refusing to fall.

She met his gaze, her voice sharp and quivering."I couldn't protect a baby? Vincent, why don't you ask yourself what kind of father you were? How useless you were? You didn't even know I was pregnant.When I lay at home, bleeding from a hemorrhage,drowning in my own calls for help-you were abroad.Not answering your phone, not replying to a single message, lost to me completely. It was your absence,
 assumption. "A boy or a girl?" he asked.

Hannah raised her gaze, catching that fragile spark of anticipation in him. It gripped her heart like a cold hand, squeezing the air from her lungs. Her fist clenched. "The gender was unknown. I... I lost the pregnancy after just over a month."

Vincent's brows snapped together. "How could you fail to protect even a baby?"

The words pierced her like a blade twisted in an old wound. Her long-buried grief and fury broke their chains, rushing out all at once. She lifted her head.Her eyes burned red, tears threatening but refusing to fall.

She met his gaze, her voice sharp and quivering."I couldn't protect a baby? Vincent, why don't you ask yourself what kind of father you were? How useless you were? You didn't even know I was pregnant.When I lay at home, bleeding from a hemorrhage,drowning in my own calls for help-you were abroad.Not answering your phone, not replying to a single message, lost to me completely. It was your absence,
your failure as a father, that cost us this child. How dare you put the blame on me?"

Her voice rose to a near shout, years of silence exploding into sound. The storm of emotion made her tremble.

Vincent's instinct was to fire back, but the sorrow etched in her eyes stopped him cold. He frowned,lips twitching, yet no words emerged. He turned his gaze aside instead.Silence was his refuge.

The cabin thickened with a chill, tension hanging like frost in the air.

Only after a long stretch of quiet did Vincent gather himself. When he finally spoke, his voice was as calm and detached as if continuing a report. "Did we ever try to have children again afterward?"
###Chapter 606 Let's Drop The Idea Of Remarrying
Hannah steadied her emotions, though her voice carried a faint edge of bitterness. "No. Because I can't have children anymore."

Vincent's brows drew together once more.

Hannah avoided his gaze, her tone flat and almost detached."Your mother never liked me. After we married, she secretly slipped infertility-inducing drugs into my meals over a long period. By the time I discovered it, the damage was done. Then came the miscarriage-the massive hemorrhage tore apart what little strength I had left. After that... I could never conceive again."

Vincent's hands tightened into fists without him realizing it. He had long been familiar with the games of power and manipulation in a family feud. It matched the picture he already carried of his mother's controlling nature. But hearing how it had played out directly against his ex-wife left him strangely unsettled.

Still,reason soon reined him in. The more he listened, the clearer it became-this marriage had been steeped in pain and regret from the beginning. Divorce, it seemed, had been not only inevitable but almost merciful.

Yet, one question gnawed at him, a riddle that refused to be solved. "Given all this-the hurt, the regret, even the cruelty from my mother-this marriage sounds barren of all worth.Then why, after the divorce, was I stillclinging to you? Why was I insistent on getting back together?"

He spoke with a certainty that bordered on coldness. "That doesn't align with how I handle things."
)
For him, an end was final. He was not one to linger at a burned bridge, much less try to rebuild it. Especially not with a relationship that had already collapsed.

The question struck Hannah like a bell. She looked at the man before her. Perhaps the Vincent before his amnesia-the man who had once given so much for her-would have allowed her to answer without hesitation that it was love. But now, faced with this rational, distant man who had no memories of even the shadow of their shared past, her confidence crumbled. She was no longer sure.

Her head lowered, long lashes trembling as they cast shadows on her cheeks. Her voice softened, tinged with frustration."I don't know. Perhaps you should be the one to answer that."

The reply left Vincent unsatisfied, yet he could not refute it.He leaned back thoughtfully, falling silent once more.

The cabin seemed wrapped in stillness, both of them locked in their own troubled world.

Time slipped away until the plane began its descent, preparing to touch down at Dorbarrow's airport.

Out of nowhere, Vincent spoke. "Let's drop the idea of remarrying."

Hannah's head lifted instantly, eyes fixed on him.

He met her gaze squarely, without evasion, his tone sharp with reason. "Since I've lost all memory of the past eight years,every feeling, every tie to you and this marriage, has vanished.To me, it's a blank page. The divorce was final in law and fact.Let's make sure our relationship ends as clearly-without dragging chains of attachment behind us."

His words were calm, clear, and merciless-like a blade slicing away the last thread.
Hannah's heart felt caught in a vice, the pressure suffocating.Yet, she forced herself into composure, locking eyes with him.
"Are you certain?"

"Certain." Vincent's reply came without pause.

Her voice trembled, yet she pressed on. "And if I refuse?"

His gaze turned cold, an edge of warning gleaming in it."Hannah, clinging to a past that only bleeds you dry is pointless.Beyond humiliating yourself and wasting both our time, there's nothing there. Sometimes, the bravest choice is to just walk away."

The words pierced her heart like iron. She did not argue. She only looked at the face-so familiar, yet now unbearably distant. He was right. She knew it. But knowing the truth and accepting it were two different battles. They had fought through storms and confirmed their feelings for each other,finally on the verge of remarrying. Was everything to be denied just because of an accidental amnesia?

Her chest ached as she studied his unyielding expression. Yet,beneath the ache, a spark of stubborn resolve stirred. She could not let go-not yet. In silence, she made her decision.Half a month. She would give herself half a month. If after that time his heart was still closed, if his stance remained as cold and unshakable, then she would yield-she would vanish from his life forever.

The jet touched down smoothly, the cabin door swinging open.

Vincent rose first. Without a glance back, he strode out.

Hannah buried her sorrow deep, stood,and followed.

As Vincent descended the steps, Derek-who had received Nate's message and had been waiting anxiously on the tarmac -rushed forward. His face was grave as he dropped a bombshell. "Mr. Jones, thank heavens you're back. Any longer,
bombshell. "Mr. Jones, thank heavens you're back. Any longer,and the company would have nearly fallen into someone else's hands!"
###Chapter 607 Confronted Erica
Vincent came to a sudden halt, his eyes blazing like steel."Explain.Now!"

Hannah, close behind, stiffened at Derek's words, her expression shadowed.

Derek spoke in a rush, each word landing with weight. "Mr.Jones,soon after you left the company to search for Ms. Scott at sea, Erica appeared with a man who could have been your reflection in a mirror. She declared that man was you,persuaded several board members and executives, and even had the impostor step in as CEO. They nearly managed to topple your position as chairman!"

Vincent's brow furrowed deeply, his gaze turning frost-cold.

Hannah stepped forward quickly; her voice calm but edged with conviction. "If I'm right, that impostor is Logan Grant. Erica has kept him around in the shadows for years. Her obsession with you has twisted into something dangerous. Since she couldn't claim you,she found someone with a passing resemblance and then forced him through multiple plastic surgeries until he became your double. That way, she could live out her fantasies and her hunger for control."

These were findings uncovered by Vincent's men before.

Vincent absorbed the information, his gaze revealing utter disgust.

Derek, his nerves tightening, pressed on. "Fortunately, you returned home when you did! This very afternoon, Erica and Logan are calling an emergency shareholder meeting. They're pushing a stock transfer through irregular channels, shifting the
pushing a stock transfer through irregular channels, shifting the stolen shares into Erica's name. Worse, they intend to sell some of the company's core projects to a foreign shell. If they succeed, the fallout will be catastrophic. Mr. Jones, you must take charge of the situation immediately!"

Hannah's voice cut in, solemn and clear. "There's one more thing-Erica had cosmetic surgery to look like me. Brace yourself when you see her."

Shock and revulsion flickered across Vincent's face. He steadied himself, forcing down the wave of nausea, and gave Hannah a sharp nod. His command to his men struck like thunder. "Back to Jones Group. At once!"

The air grew taut with his authority. Nate and the bodyguards moved without hesitation, shadows at his heels.

Derek hurried after them, but Hannah's hand caught his sleeve,halting him gently. Her tone dropped, firm and urgent. "Derek,you need to know-Vincent suffered an accident in Agosphia.His head injury cost him the last eight years of memory. At the meeting, he may not recognize recent projects or faces. You must stay close, remind him when needed, and cover for him so the meeting flows without a hitch."

Derek froze, eyes wide as disbelief struck him like lightning."Memory loss? Is it serious? Will Mr. Jones..."

His words faltered-he couldn't fathom how a CEO stripped of vital years of memories could handle the upcoming shareholder meeting.

Hannah met his gaze with unwavering resolve. "He's only lost part of his memory, not his intelligence or business acumen. He is still Vincent. You just need to feed him the missing details at the right time. Trust him with the rest."

Derek drew in a long breath, forcing the storm in his chest to still. At last, he nodded hard. "Understood, Ms. Scott. I'll stand
stil1. At last, he nodded hard. "Understood, Ms. Scott. I'll stand by him!"

He knew now wasn't the time to ask for details. But as he turned to catch up with Vincent, a thought nagged. He paused,asking, "Ms. Scott, you're not coming with us?"

Hannah's eyes sharpened, cold and decisive. "I won't be coming with you guys."

She had other business to take care of. Her reckoning with Erica had lingered too long-this time, the ledger would be closed.

She turned and strode away, her steps brisk and resolute.

******

The group soon arrived at Jones Group headquarters.

On the top floor, the conference roomn doors stood shut, the shareholder meeting already in progress.

With one swift kick, Vincent sent the doors slamming open, the sound crashing through the chamber.

All heads snapped toward the entrance.

At the head of the table sat Logan, so eerily like Vincent that the resemblance alone made the room shudder. His body trembled despite his effort to hold steady.

At the podium stood Erica. At the sudden noise, she spun around, panic flashing raw in her eyes when she saw Vincent framed in the doorway.She hadn't éxpected him to return alive,let alone so quickly.

Months ago, after Vincent left the place where Erica had been imprisoned, Logan had rescued her.

Once free and learned Vincent had abandoned everything to search for Hannah at sea, Erica had pounced on the
)
search for Hannah at sea, Erica had pounced on the opportunity. Carefully, she'd appeared at the Jones Group with Logan, now carved into Vincent's likeness by plastic surgeries.Exploiting the gap in information and leaning on the backing of several executives, she'd seized temporary control. For more than two months, no one had suspected a thing.

Now,though her heart skipped, Erica forced calm to her veins.This was Jones Group, now her domain. She had no reason to panic.

With practiced swiftness, Erica turned the tables, voice shrill with scorn as she pointed at Vincent. "Who are you? This is the highest-level shareholder meeting of Jones Group. No outsiders could just waltz in. Security! What are you waiting for?Throw him out!"
###Chapter 608 Controlling The Situation


Logan sank low in his chair, shoulders caving inward as if to make himself invisible, not daring to breathe too loudiy,much less speak.

The shareholders froze in disbelief when yet another"Vincent" crossed the threshold of the boardroom. A ripple of confusion spread across the table as glances darted back and forth, hushed murmurs swelling like a restless tide.

Vincent paid no attention to Erica's eruption. His eyes traveled with frosted detachment over the gathering before finally settling on her, the corners of his mouth curling with cruel amusement. "Erica, your audacity grows sharper with every passing day, I see."

Though Erica's pulse hammered wildly, she forced her voice to sound unyielding. "W/ho the hell are you?don't know you! Everyone, don't be deceived by this strange man!"

Vincent's laugh cracked the air, low and cold, as his gaze shifted toward the rows of shareholders."She doesn't know me? Then what of you-do none among you recognize Vincent standing before you?"

Most remained stiff and silent, their fear binding their tongues, while a handful-bribed by Erica's promises -rose hesitantly to challenge Vincent.

"Sir, you insist you are Mr. Jones. What evidence can you present?"

"Exactly! The man presiding at the head seat is theone we acknowledge as CEO!"

Grasping at their hesitant support, Erica's voice rang sharp. "Security! Are you all deaf to my command?"

Vincent regarded her theatrics as though watching a performer in a cheap play and then said calmly, "No need for summoning. Your security team no longer takes orders from you-they answer to me."

With the flick of his hand, the air shifted. Nate appeared almost instantly, leading a contingent of heavily trained guards. They sealed every exit and stationed themselves with imposing silence behind each shareholder, their presence a wall of menace that suffocated the room.
  
 
  
Nate advanced without hesitation, seizing the quaking Logan and discarding him from his chair like a rag doll.

Vincent moved forward with unhurried poise, his stride claiming the room until he reached the head of the table and seated himself with deliberate authority. His gaze swept over the chamber like a sovereign surveying subjects. "I have heard that while I was away, some individuals attempted to steal my role,transfer my shares, and dismantle the lifeblood of the Jones Group for scraps on the market?"

His voice sharpened with each syllable. "Was the plan to bleed the Jones Group dry and leave only bones?"

The sight of the guards obeying Vincent broke the last of Erica's bravado, forcing her mask to shatter.Desperation twisted her features as she screamed, "So what if I did?.Vincent, you think barging back in means you've triumphed? You're too late! The transfer agreements are already executed. The Jones Group belongs to menow! Even though you've returned, you've come back destitute. What power do you hold?"

"Oh?" Vincent's brow lifted in a cool arc as his gaze shifted toward the entrance.

Just then, Derek entered briskly, his tone steady with respect. "Mr. Jones, urgent news. All share transfers have been intercepted. Objections with full evidence have been filed with the Securities Regulatory Commission and the Administration for Industry and Commerce. The fraudulent transactions have been frozen, and no shares were successfully transferred under Ms. Stanton's name."

"What?" Erica's shriek was edged with disbelief, her fury whipping toward Lógan. "Useless fool! You swore nothing could go wrong!"

Logan lowered his head, mute with terror.

Vincent no longer wasted words on her. Instead, his gaze fixed upon the shareholders who had clung most tightly to Erica's schemes. "Since you stand so firmly with Erica, you clearly have no place in the vision ahead for the Jones Group. I will purchase your shares at ten percent above the current market value. Now,leave this building immediately."

The bodyguards moved without ceremony, driving those shareholders from the chamber like unwelcome guests.

Vincent's eyes swept the remaining assembly. "Now, does anyone here oppose my seat at this table?"
  ：
 
  
Silence blanketed the room, with no soul daring to speak.

Erica, trembling with rage, spat her venom at the shareholders,"Cowards! Every one of you! Didn't you pledge your support to me? Why are you mute now?"

"You've disrupted enough." Vincent's frown was slight, but his tone was stripped of warmth. "Remove her."

"Understood." Nate reached to seize her arm.

But before he could, the doors swung open with force.

Hannah strode in, flanked by uniformed officers, her eyes locking onto Erica like a hunter to prey. "Erica,"she said slowly, every word deliberate,"I promised, I'd see you in jail."

The officers stepped forward, unfolding an official warrant. "Erica Stanton, you are under suspicion for multiple serious crimes: homicide, corporate fraud, unlawful development of covert facilities, and orchestrating identity deception. You are formally placed under arrest. Come with us immediately."
###Chapter 609 Erica Was Disfigured


Vincent's expression shifted, surprise flashing across his features as Hannah entered, flanked by uniformed police officers. He had assumed she had walked away of her own accord, yet instead, she had reappeared at Jones Group accompanied by law enforcement.

The instant Erica's gaze collided with the officers, the color drained from her face,and terror carved deep across her rigid features. The weight of her crime pressed down-she had taken a life, and the shadow of prison loomed inevitable. That dread snapped something inside her, dragging her mind to the edge of unraveling.

With reckless ferocity, Erica shoved Logan into the officers' path and lunged for the box cutter lying on the polished conference table. She snapped open the blade in one swift motion, looping her arm around Hannah's neck and driving the knife against the tender artery beneath her skin.

"Don't move! Anyone comes closer, and she dies!" Erica's scream, frenzied and sharp, cut through the charged silence.

A faint crimson mark bloomed on Hannah's throat where the steel pressed.

The atmosphere fractured, panic tearing through the room.

The officers halted mid-step, taut and poised to strike.

Vincent's brow knit together, a grim awareness flashing in his mind-matters had just become infinitely more perilous.

Yet Hannah, even with cold steel biting her flesh, radiated unshaken composure. She exhaled slowly, her voice threaded with weary disdain. "Erica, you've committed countless blunders, but the dumbest one was taking me hostage."

Before the threat could fully settle, Hannah moved with precision.

The moment Erica's unstable emotions loosened the grip, Hannah drove her head sharply backward, the

  ：
 
  

blow slamming into Erica's nose with brutal accuracy. Simultaneously, her elbow rammed viciously into Erica's ribs.

"Ah!" Erica shrieked, flailing the box cutter wildly.

In the struggle, Hannah caught the blade, but the chaos turned against Erica herself-the edge raked savagely across her cheek, slicing a gaping linefrom cheekbone to jaw. Blood poured down in relentless streams.

In the same motion, Hannah wrenched free, her elbow unintentionally into Erica's nose.

A sickening crack echoed through the chamber. Erica's nose collapsed grotesquely, the surgical implant clearly jolted loose.

"My nose! My nose!" Erica's voice shredded into a howl, both furious and anguished, as she clutched her ruined face, blood smearing her fingers until she looked both monstrous and pitiable.

Every eye in the room turned, riveted by the ghastly spectacle. Horror rippled outward, but beneath it simmered raw contempt-the sight of Erica's mangled features drew nothing but revulsion.

Erica felt it, the weight of their disgust piercing her from every direction. Wildly, she tried to cover her face with trembling hands and strands of hair, frantic to vanish from their stares.

And then, in the midst of her degradation, Logan stirred. Wordless, he slid his jacket from his shoulders,crossed the distance quickly, and lowered it gently over Erica's head. The fabric shielded her, severing the searing gazes.

Then, Logan raised his eyes toward Officer Gavin.′′Officer, we'll comply. But could you cuff us together?"

Hannah faltered at his words, her breath catching. From her recollection of the investigation, Erica had trapped Logan in an apartment like a caged animal-denying him his own name, robbing him of freedom,and forcing him to exist as another man's imitation.

Hannah had believed Logan's hatred for Erica ran bone-deep. Yet here he was, requesting to be handcuffed at Erica's side. Had those twisted years warped into a grotesque form of devotion?
  
 
  
The answer remained outside Hannah's reach.

Gavin's brows drew together, but after a moment, he gave a short nod.

Two officers stepped forward, snapping cold steel around Erica's and Logan's wrists, locking them together.

Erica drifted in her delirium, mumbling incoherently as she leaned against Logan, her body guided by the police toward the exit.

At last, the volatile storm ebbed, the ordeal drawing to its end.

The conference room collapsed into stillness.

Vincent, seated at the head of the table, revealed nothing in his expression. He tapped his fingers lightly against the surface, drawing every gaze back to him. "Alright. Enough interruptions. The shareholders'meeting resumes now. Let's get down to business."

His gaze swept across the gathering with iron command."For two months, our company has endured some incidents. I expect a full account of our operations, updates on projects in motion, and strategies for the future. Begin with the ventures Erica was intent on selling."

From the doorway, Hannah lingered, watchingVincent handle the situation with effortless authority,reclaiming control with sharpened precision. Not a trace of his memory loss betrayed him, nor did it hinder his decisive leadership.

She exhaled softly, relief flowing through her chest, for she knew he no longer required her presence at his side.
###Chapter 610 Bringing Him A Meal


Hannah slipped out of the conference room, closing the door with quiet care. It was time to return to Luminara Group. Months away had left the company with its own thicket of challenges, waiting like unattended fires for her hand to tame.

Upon her arrival, she discovered that in her absence, the company had announced she was abroad for advanced studies.

Thus, her early reappearance surprised many employees, though it stirred no great commotion. They greeted her with courtesy, and she offered no explanations, instead plunging headlong into the stream of work.

Hannah convened a brief meeting with the company's core members-chief among them Adrian, the vice chairman-so she could swiftly gather an overview of key projects.

Thankfully, Adrian's keen mind and steady hand had kept the machinery running with precision, ensuring every venture moved forward in good order.

Hannah then immersed herself in the tasks at hand, the entire day consumed with clearing the mountain of documents and concluding decisions on vital projects.

Only after work hours did she allow herself a moment of pause.

Almost without thinking, her gaze fell to her phone. No messages from Vincent.

Instead,Claude, somehow aware of her return, had sent several texts filled with concern.

Hannah frowned, brushed them aside, and chose not to reply.

After a brief pause, she called Derek. "Derek, is Vincent still at the company?"

"Yes, Ms. Scott. Mr. Jones remnains in his office. He shows no sign of leaving," Derek answered, his voice weary.
"Has he eaten yet?"she asked.

"Not at all. I've tried to persuade him several times, bout he insists he'll eat only when the work is done,"Derek replied.

"I see." Hannah ended the call and drove directly to Vincent's favored restaurant. She chose several of his favorite dishes, gentle on the stomach, and brought them herself to Jones Group.

When she reached the CEO's office, Vincent was in the middle of a meeting with several executives.

Not wishing to interrupt, Hannah waited outside, food in hand. Through theglass,she saw his sharp profile,eyes fixed on the discussion, utterly unaware of her presence.

Minutes stretched, until the clock struck eight.

At last, deciding enough was enough, Hannah knocked.

The door opened, and she stepped in, slicing into the rhythm of the meeting. All heads turned toward her.

Vincent's brows knotted in displeasure. "Who told you to come here?" he asked, his tone like cold steel.

Ignoring the chill in his words, Hannah crossed to the table. "It's already eight. You should eat."

"Continue with the meeting," Vincent instructed; eyes never leaving the screen. His dismissal was as deliberate as it was cutting.

Hannah stepped closer, her voice low. "Vincent, you must eat. Your stomach is not strong. The doctor warned you-meals must be on time."

Yet, he acted as though she had spoken into the wind, his focus rooted in a project's risk assessment.

The executives exchanged glances, hunger gnawing at them, but none dared to speak.

Watching Vincent ignore her so completely, Hannah felt her patience fray. She fixed him with a steady gaze."Are you truly not going to eat?"

"No," Vincent replied flatly, a note of impatience tightening his voice as his eyes stayed buried in the documents.
Hannah said nothing more, only stood and watched him, her silence carrying weight.

Derek, sensing the shift in the air, felt a chill crawl across his back. He dared not break it.

The meeting paused for a brief recess.

But Vincent made no move to rest; instead, he picked up another document and pressed on, relentless as ever.

At last, Derek tried, "Mr. Jones, perhaps you should-"

Before he could finish, Hannah acted. With a sharp snap, she opened the food boxes. Turning to the executives, she announced, "You've worked long and hard. This meeting has stretched late, and you must be hungry. Please, have something to eat."

The executives froze, caught between temptation and terror, the aroma of the meal filling the room while Vincent's expression darkened further.

"Ms. Scott, isn't this meant for Mr. Jones?" one brave executive ventured.

"He refuses to eat," Hannah replied evenly. "But food should never be wasted. You labor day and night for this company; you shouldn't be left starving. Derek, you as well-come and eat."

Derek's eyes darted nervously between Hannah and Vincent. His voice trembled as he asked, "Mr. Jones,may l..."

Vincent glanced over, his gaze sharp and cold."Go."

As though pardoned, Derek hurried forward and began to eat.

At the sight, the executives could no longer suppress their hunger and gathered around the table,expressing their thanks to Hannah repeatedly.

"There's no need to thank me," Hannah said softly. "You should thank Mr. Jones. The meal was meant for him, but since he won't eat..."

Her words trailed, her eyes settling on Vincent, carrying both tenderness and unspoken reproach.
###Chapter 611 You Do Feel Something


Vincent caught every word clearly, and in his mind, Hannah was being insincere. She insisted all the dishes had been arranged for him, yet her impatience betrayed her claim.

After the meal, the meeting picked up again, though the air was heavy, taut like a bowstring readyto snap.

Vincent moved through the agenda with sharp precision, outlining the crux of each project and exposing hidden risks, as though the earlier episode had been erased from memory.

The executives scrambled to keep pace, their thoughts lagging behind their leader's swift reasoning.

At last, all matters were covered, and the clock had already struck half-past ten.

Closing the final file, Vincent declared evenly, "That will do for today. By tomorrow, I expect complete execution plans on my desk."

The executives and Derek, relieved as though they had been freed from an iron yoke, wasted no time in leaving.

Silence soon claimed the office, broken only by the low, steady hum of the air,conditioning.

Vincent pressed at his temples, weariness seeping in, and a dull discomfort stirred in his stomach. Just as he was preparing to gather his things to leave, he noticed Hannah hadn't gone. Curled on the sofa in the corner, she had drifted into sleep.

His brows drew together as he stepped toward her. Standing over the sofa, he studied her still form. After a brief hesitation, he reached down to rouse her."|fyou're tired, go sleep in your own place111he said,his tone far from tender.

The instant his hand brushed her shoulder, Hannah reacted instinctively. Her arms slipped around his neck,tugging him gently downward.

Caught off guard, Vincent lost his balance and instinctively braced himself against the sofa's backrest,

  ：
 
  
barely preventing himself from collapsing fully on top of her. Even so, their faces hovered only inches apart;her breath, warm and steady, reached him with startling clarity.

His first instinct was to draw back. Yet, her hold tightened, keeping him close, while she whispered plaintively, "Don't go."

Vincent froze. Was she awake, or merely speaking in a dream?

As he lingered in doubt, her voice wove through the quiet, trembling and sorrowful."We fought so hard to be together, and now you've forgotten it all... Do you know how much that tears at me? And you're so cold to me-it's breaking my heart."

Her words struck like fine needles, pricking his chest and spreading a strange ache that he swiftly tried to smother. Keeping his tone frosted, he muttered, "Since you're awake, get up and leave."

Yet, Hannah continued her monologue, lamenting his amnesia and indifference, her tone pitiful and aggrieved.

Vincent knew freeing himself would have been simple. She was not strong. But he didn't pry her arms away.He didn't why. Perhaps it was the fragile picture she made in her sleep, stirring a flicker of tenderness.Perhaps it was the sorrow in her words, seeping into his guarded heart. Or perhaps-just perhaps-it was the nearness itself that unsettled him.

In that heartbeat of his distraction, Hannah lifted her face, her lips brushing firmly against his.

Vincent's eyes widened, his mind emptied of thought. More startling still, Hannah pressed further, intent on deepening the kiss.

Sense crashed back into him. With sudden force, he shoved her away-so sharply that she struck against the sofa's back.

"Ouch!" she cried, pain flashing in her eyes as they snapped open. There was no drowsiness there.

Realization dawned swiftly. Straightening, Vincent adjusted his crumpled shirt, his expression dark as thunder."You were pretending to sleep?"
Rubbing her sore shoulder, Hannah's face nonetheless bloomed with a bright smile. She admitted openly,"Yes. The moment you came near, I woke. I only pretended because I wanted to test something."

Rising, she stepped forward deliberately, her movements driving him backward until his desk blocked his retreat.

"I wanted to find out whether, after losing your memory and forgetting me and everything between us..." Her gaze locked unflinchingly with his. "Whether your body-your instincts-would still respond to me."

Her smile deepened, edged with triumph. "And it seems they do. You do feel something."

Cornered against the desk, Vincent had nowhere left to move. His reply came cold, steady. "I'm a man. It's natural to have a physical reaction when a reasonably attractive woman makes advances. It proves nothing."

But Hannah, far from discouraged, laughed with even greater delight. Placing her hands firmly on the desk,she caged him in. Her eyes gleamed as she looked up. "So you admit it, then?"

Vincent frowned."Admit what?"
###Chapter 612 |Used To Like Her


"You admit I'm pretty," Hannah said, her smile blooming brighter, like a flame catching the wind.

"You're impossible," Vincent muttered, turning his face aside-yet the faint flush at his ears betrayed him.

Just then, a knock sounded at the office door.

Derek stepped in, half his frame still outside. "Mr. Jones, the car is waiting downstairs-"

He froze mid-sentence, his words strangled as his eyes fell upon Hannah and Vincent, their closeness far too telling.

Derek's heart gave a lurch. Had he stumbled in at precisely the wrong time?

Vincent quickly pushed Hannah's arm away, his voice clipped and cold."Okay."

Hannah stepped back with her smile intact. She said lightly to Vincent, "I'll be leaving too. See you,Mr.Jones."

She turned toward the door, but as she passed Derek, who stood stiff as a post, she halted. Slipping a small item from her pocket, she tucked it neatly into the breast pocket of his suit. With a gentle pat, she added,"Derek, you've worked hard today. Take this with you-it may come in handy."

The gesture was swift, unforced, and she vanished with a smile still curving her lips.

Vincent, watching from his spot, took in Hannah's familiar gesture with Derek. All trace of warmth he had felt from her kiss evaporated. In its place rose irritation, sharp and consuming. This woman seemed to scatter her charms like breadcrumbs before every man she crossed paths with. Utterly shameless. His opinion of Hannah plummeted, sinking to rock bottom.


******

The car slid smoothly into the night, silence pooling in the cabin.

  ：
 
  
Vincent leaned back, brow knitted tight and eyes closed, the slight queasiness in his stomach adding to his agitation.

From the front seat, Derek caught Vincent's stern profile in the rearview mirror. After a pause, he fished out a box of medicine from his pocket and handed it over.′′M1r.Jones, your stomach isn't well, is it? This should help ease it."

Vincent opened his eyes, glancing at the box without reaching for it. His tone was flat as stone. "You prepared this?"

Derek chuckled faintly, answering with candor, "I can't claim that much foresight. Ms. Scott handed it to me earlier. She just messaged me-said you hadn't eaten dinner, you were staying up late, and would probably get stomach pains. She wanted me to give this to you."

Vincent's gaze lingered on the medicine, recalling the fleeting moment at the doorway.′′SO,that's what she slipped you just now?"

"Yes, Mr. Jones." Derek nodded, studying Vincent's expression with care.

As Vincent's features grew darker, Derek's mind sparked with a reckless thought that leapt out of his mouth."Mr. Jones, were you jealous?" He had assumed Vincent's irritation stemmed from Hannah giving him something.

Vincent's eyes turned glacial, a clear warning lacing his voice. "Derek, you've always seemed to know your place."

Derek's heart jumped; he realized he had crossed the line. He hurried to apologize. "Forgive me, Mr. Jones, I spoke out of turn! I forgot-you're still dealing with amnesia, and you don't even like Ms. Scott now."

Vincent caught onto the underlying message, his frown deepening. "I used to like her?"

The thought seemed almost absurd. He found it difficult to imagine himself harboring feelings toward such a woman.

Derek answered earnestly, his voice carrying emotion, "More than just like, Mr. Jones-you were utterly taken with her. Even after the divorce, you wouldn't let go. You chased after her and refused to give up. It

  ：
 
  
was truly-"

"Enough!" Vincent cut in, his tone slicing the air. His face darkened even further. "I don't want the details."The picture Derek painted-a man so humbled and desperate-felt alien, almost repulsive. That could not have been him.

Derek shut his mouth instantly, not daring another word.

The car slipped back into silence.

After a long pause, Derek ventured cautiously,′′M.. Jones, shall we return to Sterling Heights?"

"Sterling Heights?" Vincent echoed, the name stirring not even the faintest memory.
###Chapter 613 Informed His Family Of His Amnesia


Derek suddenly remembered that Vincent's memories were stillfractured, and he hastily clarified, "Ah, that apartment in Sterling Heights was the one you purchased so you could pursue Ms. Scott more easily. It's directly beneath hers."

A shadow crossed Vincent's expression, the shift in his demeanor instant and chilling. "Take me back to the Jones estate," he commanded curtly.

"Yes!" Derek replied at once, his voice tight with nerves as he swerved the car around without another word.

By the time the vehicle glided through the grand iron gates of the Jones estate, it was already the wee hours.

When Vincent stepped through the familiar doorway, a strange calm descended upon him-an unspoken recognition stirring deep within, dulling the restlessness caused by his amnesia.

Once Vincent was settled, Derek lingered instead of leaving. He slipped into the kitchen and returned moments later with a bowl of steaming porridge, its faint aroma mild and comforting. "Mr. Jones, you skipped dinner, and your stomach's been acting up again. This will be gentle on it."

Vincent looked at the bowl but didn't reach for it. His gaze lifted, cool and probing. "Did Hannah tell you to do this?"

Derek's grin was unguarded. "Yes, Ms. Scott was worried sick. She even messaged me to make sure you got home safely. Once she learned you were at your family residence, she walked me through the recipe herself-every detail, even the timing and spice."

Vincent let out a brief, derisive exhale. "That wasn't necessary."

Seeing his indifference, Derek made a show of taking the porridge away.′′A|lright then, Mr. Jones. I'll take this back and let you rest,"

But before Derek could move another step, Vincent's voice-low and cold-cut through the quiet."Leave it."

  ：
 
  
A smile tugged at Derek's lips. He quickly replaced the bowl on the table."◯f course. Take your time. I'll see myself out."

Vincent said nothing further, and Derek wisely slipped from the room.

For a long moment, Vincent simply stared at the porridge as if studying a memory buried somewhere inside it. Eventually, he lifted the spoon and ate in silence. By the time the bowl was empty, the unease in his stomach had eased.

The next morning, Vincent descended to the breakfast room.

Sharon and Danica both froze, stunned at the sight of him back in the estate as if time had rolled backward.

Sharon immediately set her utensils aside, her tone trembling with a mix of relief and reproach. "Where on earth have you been for the past two months? Your phone was dead, you ignored every message-were you trying to give me a heart attack from worry?"

Vincent moved forward and gently helped his grandmother to sit, his tone measured but soft. "Grandma, I'm sorry. I was overseas dealing with urgent matters. It all came up suddenly, and I didn't have a moment to reach out."

Danica, sounding concerned, chimed in,"Vincent, you were out of touch for so long. Everyone was worried."Though their bond was strained, her motherly concern still flickered beneath the surface.

When Vincent finally took his seat, his face grew serious. "There's something important I need to tell you both."

A tense glance passed between Danica and Sharon.

Danica's heartbeat quickened, dread tightening in her chest. "What could possibly be that serious? Don't tell me you're thinking of remarrying that Hannah." The thought alone made her blood run cold.

Vincent's brows drew together instantly, his answer sharp and sure. "No. This has nothing to do with her."

Danica exhaled, visibly relieved. In her mind, Hannah had always been the cause of every fracture between her and Vincent.

  ：
 
  
Sharon, on the other hand, looked fainty disheartened but still asked, "Then what is this matter you want to talk about?"

Vincent's voice was even, his gaze unwavering."While I was abroad, I had an accident. I suffered a head injury. The doctors say I have selective amnesia-l've lost roughly eight years of memory."

"What?

Amnesia?"

The words tumbled out together, both women's disbelief mirrored in each other's eyes.

Sharon's face crumpled with concern. "What did the doctors say, Vincent? Is it dangerous? Does it interfere with your daily life? Will your memories ever come back?" Her only focus was his wellbeing.

Vincent reached across the table and gave her hand a light squeeze, his voice calm. "Don't worry, Grandma.It doesn't affect my day-to-day life. I can still work and handle business as usual. The doctors said the memories might resurface slowly, but there's no guarantee-they could be gone forever."

Sharon's eyes glistened with sorrow, worry etched deep in every line of her face.

Meanwhile, Danica's mind was already whirring behind her composed expression. Eight years erased... That meant Vincent had forgotten his marriage to Hannah entirely-and the reckless things he'd done afterward,just trying to reclaim her after their divorce...

Danica felt a spark of triumph flicker quietly within her. This could be the perfect chance she'd been waiting for.
###Chapter 614 Death


Danica quelled the surge of excitement threatening to spill over and arranged her features into a mask of concern. Her tone softened as she asked, "Vincent, are you saying you have no recollection of Hannah at all? What feelings do you hold toward her now?"

Her eyes remained fixed on Vincent, scrutinizing every subtle shift in his demeanor, searching for any trace of emotion.

Sharon, too, regarded Vincent with quiet attentiveness, waiting for his answer with a thoughtfufrown.

Vincent's expression barely changed-only a trace of detachment surfaced, as if he were discussing someone of no consequence whatsoever. "I feel nothing. She's become a stranger to me. Our marriage ended-legally and in every possible sense-and there's no reason for me to reopen that Chapter. I have no interest in unnecessary complications."

His words were stripped of sentiment, built entirely on reason and the fragments of memory he possessed.

Sharon's brows furrowed, ready to interject, but Danica swiftly stepped in before she could.

A bright, relieved smile bloomed across Danica's face as she nodded with unrestrained enthusiasm."That's exactly what I wanted to hear! I've always said that being entangled with Hannah would bring you nothing but heartache. Now that she's out of the picture and forgotten, everything can finally be peaceful again."

Sharon turned toward Danica with a reproachful glare. "How could you say that, Danica? Their marriage didn't fail out of hatred-it was a result of youth and misunderstandings. Didn't Vincent almost reconcile with Hannah before the accident? Things were improving between them! Maybe his memory loss is a chance for them to start anew, to find their way back to each other."

Danica answered immediately, her tone unwavering, "Sharon, that's not how it works. Once a marriage ends,it's proof enough that the two people weren't meant to be. Vincent forgetting her is the universe confirming what we already knew-they were never compatible. That's not tragedy, but destiny."

  ：
 
  
Sharon parted her lips to argue again, but Vincent's voice cut through, cold and resolute. "Mom's right.Hannah and I were never suitable for each other."

He rose from his seat, signaling an end to the conversation. "Grandma, please don't concern yourself with my private life. I'm not interested in Hannah anymore. My focus is on the company and my work-I won't be pursuing any romantic attachments for the time being. If you'll excuse me, I have business to attend to."

He gave them a polite nod before turning and walking out of the Jones estate, his steps steady and deliberate.

Sharon watched him go, her frustration spilling out in a helpless sigh. "When his memory returns and he recalls what he's said today, he'll regret every word!"

But Danica's lips curved in satisfaction, her mind already working quietly behind her calm mask. Vincent's amnesia had unfolded like a gift from fate. Now, at last, she could choose a refined, well-bred woman for him-someone graceful, loyal, and willing to align perfectly with her wishes.

With Hannah erased from Vincent's memories, Danica believed that any interference from her in his marital affairs would pose no threat to their mother-son bond. Without delay, she began compiling a list of eligible women she deemed worthy to become her daughter-in-law.




In the days that followed, Hannah cooperated closely with the police, attending repeated interrogations to recount, in painstaking detail, everything she knew about Erica's crimes.

The case progressed swiftly-evidence stacked against Erica was irrefutable, and the court wasted no time delivering judgment.

In the end, Erica was sentenced to death for multiple offenses.

Whispers spread that on the morning of Erica's execution, Logan went to claim her body. He buried her himself in a secluded cemetery, far from the noise of the city.

By the next day, grim news surfaced-Logan had been found lifeless in his rented apartment, a note left behind that no one dared to read aloud.

  ：
 
  
At her desk, Hannah sat motionless, her pen suspended above the paper as she tried to process both deaths. It wasn't triumph that filled her chest, but an aching blend of sorrow, exhaustion, and quiet disbelief.The poisonous love that had fueled so much pain had ended in ruin, leaving behind only the bitter echo of fate's cruelty.

She took a steadying breath, lifted her phone, and typed a single message to her mother. "Mom, I avenged Dad."

Then, she set out alone, driving through the outskirts until she reached the cemetery.

There, before her father's grave, Hannah knelt and brushed the dust from the carved letters, arranging fresh flowers with deliberate care. She didn't speak or cry-only stood.in silence, as if her heart could communicate what words could not.

When she finally turned to leave, her steps halted.

A familiar figure stood not far away-Vincent, dressed in black, holding a bouquet as he lingered before another gravestone.

Her heart gave a faint tremor before she realized the date-it was the anniversary of his father's death. No wonder she had encountered him here.

Vincent's gaze lifted, his brows drawing together as he noticed her presence. His tone was cold, edged with disdain. "Even when I come to pay my respects, you have to follow me? Hannah, I thought I made it clear-l don't like overly persistent women."

His words stung, but they also ignited a spark of resistance in her chest. Straightening her posture, she stepped closer and met his frosty eyes head-on.′′Mr. Jones," she said with a faint, defiant smile,"don't flatter yourself. What makes you think I came here for you?"
###Chapter 615 Have You Been Going On Blind Dates


Vincent let out a sharp, mocking laugh, the sound laced with disbelief, as though Hannah had just said something outrageously absurd. "At this hour, in this place, you just happen to bump into me? Come on,Hannah, that's hardly a coincidence."

Hannah observed the smug curve of his mouth, a flicker of amusement softening her expression. A laugh escaped her, though her eyes remained cool and detached. "Mr. Jones, let me make this clear-you are not the center of my world. I'm here for someone else entirely."

Vincent's expression hardened, the crease between his brows deepening.

Tilting her head slightly, her tone took on a teasing note. "What's wrong? Am I supposed to orbit around you?"

Her words threw Vincent off for a moment, but he quickly recovered, his smirk sharpening with ridicule."You cling to the memory of a dead man, yet you can't release me, your ex-husband. Hannah, you really know how to play your games, don't you?"

The venom in his voice struck like a lash, deliberate and unrelenting.

The faint, composed smile Hannah had worn faltered, her features darkening with wounded restraint."Vincent, that's enough. Don't twist this into something it's not. I came here for the same reason you did-to honor the deceased one."

Vincent's reply came clipped and cold. "Save the sentiment. We're divorced. You no longer need to pay respect to my dead father."

Her anger broke through her calm façade, heat flaring in her eyes. Without warning, she stepped forward,caught Vincent's wrist, and dragged him toward a nearby tombstone with sudden force.

Startled, Vincent stumbled after her, unprepared for the sudden movement.

She stopped before a weathered tombstone and pointed at the engraved inscription. "Read it, Vincent

  ：
 
  
-'Raymond Scott's Grave!' This is my father's resting place. That's whyI'm here."

Vincent's gaze fell on the unfamiliar name, and every biting retort he had prepared dissolved on his tongue.

A silence thick with awkwardness settled between them.

After a few seconds, he awkwardly pulled his hand back, straightened his suit, and said nothing.He turned,ready to leave.

"Wait," Hannah called out softly.

Vincent didn't stop, his voice cutting back with icy distance. "If this is about that misunderstanding, I'm not offering an apology."

He simply wasn't one to apologize.

"Who asked for your apology?" Hannah's tone steadied, though something curious lingered beneath."1just wanted to ask-have you been going on blind dates lately?"

Vincent paused but didn't look back. His answer came flat, devoid of emotion. "Yes." Danica had been arranging a series of introductions with affluent daughters she deemed suitable matches. He'd found the meetings dull, but he'd gone along, more to placate his mother than from genuine interest-anything to draw a line between himself and Hannah once and for all.

"Anyone you actually like?" she asked, her fingers tightening slightly at her sides.

Turning at last, Vincent locked eyes with her, his gaze detached and distant. "That's not something an ex-wife should concern herself with."

Hannah's chest tightened, but she forced an airy smile. "Fine. Don't tell me. It's not like I care."

She figured that if he moved on and found someone else, so would she. They could walk separate paths,untethered, unbothered. She would seal away their shared past, never pestering him again.

But as she began to turn away, a quiet, low voice drifted from behind her. "No."

Hannah froze, surprised, and turned, only to find Vincent was already walking away, his figure distant

  ：
 
  
against the gray expanse. Was that"no" in response to her question?

Vincent's stride quickened, as if eager to escape his own voice. Regret hit him instantly. He should have stayed silent, or better yet, left her standing there without another word. But the sight of her feigned indifference, her gaze lowered in brittle composure, had unsettled something deep inside him-a pulse of panic, sharp and inexplicable. It felt like if he didn't say something, he'd lose something irreplaceable. The thought clawed at him.

Agitated, Vincent strode briskly to his car, wrenched open the door, and slid in, his face carved in stormy tension.

From the driver's seat, Derek glanced nervously at Vincent through the rearview mirror and toward Hannah lingering by the cemetery gate."Mr. Jones," he ventured cautiously,′′aren't you leaving with Ms. Scott?"

Vincent's glare was swift and cutting. "Couldn't you just mind your own business?"

Derek shrank back but gestured toward the gate. "Mr. Jones, look-someone's bothering Ms. Scott."

Vincent's eyes followed his gesture immediately.

By the cemetery gate stood a man in a pressed suit, blocking her path with an overly eager smile. He reached for her arm, the gesture intrusive.

Hannah's face hardened with visible irritation as she pulled away.

Vincent's jaw tensed, his eyes darkening, every trace of composure vanishing. A chill radiated from him,dangerous and unreadable. "Who the hell is he?"
###Chapter 616 This Is The Men's Room


Derek replied at once, his voice steeped in derision, "That's Claude Hobbes. A persistent admirer of Ms.Scott. Word is, he's already engaged, yet he clings to her obsessively, like a mutt gnawing a bone."

His gaze flicked to the rearview mirror where Claude's desperate attempt to seize Hannah's arm played out,and with thinly veiled disgust, he added, "Ms. Scott's turned him down more times than I can count, but the man's thickas stone-utterly without shame."

Vincent's expression didn't shift. His eyes cut toward the commotion outside the car, cold and remote. He turned his attention away, his tone stripped of all inflection."Drive."

Derek blinked, surprised by the command.′′Mr. Jones, shouldn't we intervene? Claude's clearly harassing Ms.Scott!"

"I said drive." The words fell sharp, glacial.

One look at Vincent's face told Derek he'd pushed too far. With reluctant obedience, he shifted gears and pulled the car away.

Meanwhile, Claude reached for Hannah's hand again, desperation softening his features.′′Anna,where have you been? I searched everywhere for you."

Hannah sidestepped his hand, her voice chilled and measured. "I've been occupied with work."

Claude's brows drew together in doubts. "Just work? So busy that you couldn't send a single message?Anna, tell me the truth-is something wrong?"

Suppressing the irritation tightening her chest, Hannah forced her tone to remain steady. "First, I've indeed been buried in work. Second, Claude, you're an engaged man. We have no business crossing certain lines.Keeping distance is the least courtesy we owe your fiancée."
A shadow of sorrow swept across Claude's face as he tried to play upon nostalgia. "I know l'm engaged.But after all this time, can't we at least stay close friends? You were once like family to me, Anna. Now you don't

  ：
 
  
even want to see me-isn't that cruel?"

Complex emotions flickered briefly in his eyes.

"Family?" Hannah let out a faint, scornful laugh. "Claude, what once bound us as family twisted into something else long ago. Keeping our distance now is the most basic respect I can offer you and your fiancée.I refuse to be branded the woman meddling in someone else's relationship."

"You'd never be that," Claude argued, desperation creeping in. "No one would dare accuse you.I can explain..."

Hannah's patience snapped. "Stay far away from me, and only then will I truly avoid being unfairly accused.That's how I can avoid the gossip you pretend not to hear. Every time you approach me, you drag trouble to my door."

The unyielding coldness in her gaze struck him like a blow. Pain carved deep lines into his face as realization settled in-he had truly lost her.

Hannah didn't waver. "I have work to attend to," she said, her tone glacial. "Goodbye."

Before he could reply, she turned and strode to her car,leaving,the cemetery-and him-behind.

******

Back at her office, Hannah buried herself in paperwork until the clock announced evening. A business dinner awaited her.

She met the client at an elegant restaurant, its polished ambiance humming with quiet wealth.

As they approached their table, Hannah's eyes drifted unconsciously across the room-and froze. Vincent.He sat opposite a stylish woman, whom she didn't recognize, and they were both engaged in seemingly easy conversation.

The faint smile touching Vincent'slips sent an unexpected sting through Hannah's chest. An ache she didn't wish to name spread beneath her ribs.

Forcing a pleasant expression, Hannah offered her client an apologetic smile and subtly instructed the
  ：
 
  
waiter to seat them at a table close to Vincent's-close enough to overhear if she wished.

Once seated, she found herself glancing over more often than she wanted to admit. The quiet laughter Vincent shared with the woman across from him seemed to dull the rest of the restaurant's glow. Even the fine meal before her tasted of nothing.

When Vincent finally rose, appearing to head toward the restroom, impulse overrode reason. "Excuse me,"she said softly to her client and then followed Vincent.

She pushed through the door of the men's restroom without hesitation.

Vincent stood at the sink, water running over his hands. When their eyes met in the mirror, his movements stilled, and for a moment, surprise flashed beneath his composed exterior. He shut off the tap,turned, and regarded her with faint annoyance creasing his brow."This is the men's room."

Hannah leaned casually against the door, arms folded, calm and unapologetic."Of course,I'm aware."

Her voice carried a hint of challenge. Boundaries had never intimidated her-especially not when it came to pursuing him.

Once, during their university years, she had crossed a far bolder line. After PE class, when the rest of the students hurried through changing and scattered from the gym, Vincent, true to his obsession with cleanliness, had lingered for his habitual shower before dressing.

Hannah, reckless with curiosity and emboldened by infatuation, had slipped unnoticed into the men's locker room and concealed herself inside Vincent's personal locker.

The room had been utterly still-just the faint hum of the fluorescent lights above. She'd waited, heart hammering, until the echo of footsteps broke the silence. Vincent's. Each step drew closer, steady and unhurried. The sound of the locker door creaking open made her breath hitch...

The next moment, their gazes had collided.

Hannah could still recall that scene with startling clarity: Vincent, fresh from the shower, his torso bare and taut, a towel knotted loosely around his waist, droplets of water gliding down from his hair to his collarbone.

The sight had robbed her of thought.

For a heartbeat, Vincent had looked startled. Then, his composure returned, his brows knittingin sharp disapproval, voice low and cutting through the steam-filled air. "What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 617 Hiding In The Locker Together


At that time, the younger and bolder Hannah had failed to process a single syllable of Vincent's voice. Every fragment of her attention had clung to him alone.

Never before had she seen a man's physique in such unguarded nearness; the sight had made her face blaze crimson, her pulse thundered as though a drumline echoed within her chest, and one reckless thought overtook her entire being-she had to win him. Letting a man like him slip by without a moment of fiery romance would leave her haunted by regret throughout her college life.

Vincent had observed Hannah, her unbroken stare fixed on him while his question went unanswered, and a deep crease appeared between his brows. Abandoning his inquiry, he reached forward, clasped her by the arm, and tugged her out of the locker. "You should leave."

The cool firmness of his palm against her heated skin had jolted her sharply back into awareness. Yet,instead of obeying, she caught his wrist, looked up at him with bright eyes, and asked, "Why have you been avoiding me lately? I've been searching everywhere for you in vain-l had no choice but to wait here.Vincent, how about a movie tonight? There's a new release, and|−11

"I'm busy," Vincent had cut her off, his tone clipped, trying to pull his hand away.

But Hannah had refused to let go. "It's only two hours! Just the film, I promise. Afterward, I'll go home quietly without bothering you."

Her wide eyes had glimmered with anticipation.

Vincent hadn't uttered a word, but the chill in his silence had been its own rejection.

Hannah, however, had been stubborn by nature. Drawing in a shaky breath, she straightened her shoulders with quiet defiance. "If you don't agree, I'll stay right here!"

Vincent's lips had curved faintly, a flicker of amusement mingling with his irritation as he lifted an eyebrow."So you plan to stay and watch me change?"

  ：
 
  
A flush had tinted Hannah's face, but she didn't retreat. Instead, she glanced him over deliberately and murmured,"It's not as if I'd suffer any loss."

Patience had evaporated from Vincent's expression; he was just about to push her toward the door when sudden footsteps and hurried voices echoed beyond the changing room.

"Quickly, there's no one around-"

"Don't rush!"

Vincent had frozen. If Hannah stepped out now, she'd be bumping into those two outside. A girl emerging from the men's locker room would be enough to trigger scandalous rumors.

Vincent had frowned and then acted on instinct-he pulled Hannah back toward the lockers and shut them both inside.

The narrow compartment had forced their bodies close enough for her breath to brush his collarbone.

Hannah's heartbeat had stuttered. She knew Vincent hadn't done this because he had any interest in her,but because his nature recoiled from trouble. He simply wanted to steer clear of needless scandal, avoiding the slightest hint of gossip or misunderstanding. Hiding her was his way of avoiding a bigger mess. But to her,pressed so near the man she adored, every second felt like a dangerous dream.

Outside, the voices had grown clearer. They belonged unmistakably to Pete Freguson, the P.E. teacher, and Melody Harrison,the chemistry teacher.

"Relax, darling, it's been a while since class ended; there's absolutely no one here!" Peter's voice had drifted low and hurried.

Melody's reply had been softer, playful yet cautious. "Still, maybe we should look around first. What if someone's here?"

The word check had made Hannah's blood run cold. She instinctively clutched Vincent's arm tighter.If they opened the locker, she'd never live it down.

Peter had sounded impatient. "Why waste time checking? Why not check me instead? I've been dying to get
  ：
 
  

Melody's laughter had rippled faintly, followed by the unmistakable wet sound of kissing.

Already an adult then, Hannah had known exactly what was happening outside. Her cheeks flamed; her spine went rigid; her gaze lifted instinctively to Vincent. His hair was still damp from the shower, a droplet sliding down his temple as his jaw tensed liké stone.

In the confined locker, their bodies had been inevitably pressed together. The thin fabric between them did little to mask the quickening rhythm of their breaths or the heat radiating through their skin.

Outside, the teachers' passion had grown louder, their voices dissolving into breathy moans that seeped through the locker door.

Hannah's throat had gone dry, her skin prickling with unbearable warmth.

The movements outside had grown increasingly fervent until a careless shift sent a jolt against the locker that concealed Vincent and Hannah, producing a muted thump that echoed through the narrow space.

The teachers had continued right there, pressed against the very door behind which Vincent and Hannah hid.

Every sound, every sigh, every motion beyond the barrier had struck Hannah like a pulse in her veins. The world narrowed to the hammering of her own heart and the sound of Vincent's restrained breathing.

Her mind had emptied, thought dissolved, leaving only the charged air between them. Her eyes shifted to Vincent's lips-unmoving, tense, too close-and before reason could stop her, she surged forward and kissed him.
###Chapter 618 Don't You Want To Finish What We Started


Hannah's kiss had been awkward but daring, catching Vincent off guard.

Instinctively, Vincent had jerked his head to the side,trying to pull back, but the confined space trapped him, making it seem as though he welcomed her advance.

Sensing his reaction, Hannah's confidence had surged, her boldness igniting further. Her fingers, almost on their own,began exploring his chest and shoulders, tracing his form.

Vincent, regaining control, had gently grasped her wandering hands, nudging her back, his breath already uneven.

Undeterred, Hannah, exhilarated by the moment, had leaned closer, her lips grazing his ear as she murmured in a sultry whisper, "They're out there, caught up in their own encounter... Doesn't that stir something in you?"

"Quiet," Vincent had hissed, his voice rough and low. A tense heat coiled within him, particularly beneath the towel wrapped around his waist, betraying his efforts to stay composed.

Hannah had caught the strain in his tone, sensing his struggle to keep his calm. Acting on impulse, she began unfastening her blouse, one button at a time, revealing glimpses of her enticing figure.

She had pressed herself against him again, her lips brushing his throat. Boldly, she flicked her tongue against his skin, teasing him further. Then, in a daring move, her knee nudged lightly against the towel at his waist.

Vincent had stiffened instantly, his body rigid with tension. How could he possibly resist such temptation? In that moment, his restraint crumbled under the flood of raw desire. Abruptly, he leaned down, claiming her lips in a fierce, hungry kiss.

No longer passive, he'd taken charge, kissing her with an untamed intensity. His actions were unpolished but brimming with fervor.

  ：
 
  
In a bold move, he'd guided her hand beneath the towel, the heat of his skin drawing a soft gasp from her lips,while Vincent let out a low, stifled groan.

Just then, a voice from outside the locker-Melody's-had broken the moment, sounding confused. "Peter,did you hear that? I swear there's a noise coming from the locker."

Instantly, Hannah and Vincent had frozen, holding their breath in panic.

Hannah's heart had raced-if they were caught like this, Vincent's pride might never recover, and he could resent her forever.

Fortunately, Peter, lost in his own fervor, had dismissed it gruffly. "What noise? You're imagining things. That was just me. This feels amazing, Melody! Don't stop-come on, let's go again."

With that, his movements had grown more fervent. He and Melody had moved to somewhere else, yet the muffled rhythm of movement and breath beyond the door still echoed with unmistakable intensity.

Inside the locker, Vincent's breath had been heavy as he resumed with Hannah.

Time blurred until Vincent had finally let go of her hand, his eyes still locked on hers, smoldering with intensity.

Hannah's pulse had raced as she held his gaze. Then, with fearless abandon, she slipped off her underwear in front of him. Taking his hand, she guided it beneath her skirt, tilting her face up to kiss him again,whispering, "I want it too."

Vincent's hand had hesitated briefly before moving with growing eagerness.

Hannah had silently rejoiced in her choice of a skirt that day.

In the tight confines, their bodies had glistened with sweat.

Vincent's kisses had deepened, growing more fervent.

Hannah had bitten her lip to stifle her moans, though faint whimpers slipped out.

Eventually, the noises outside had faded, replaced by the rustle of fabric, soft chuckles, and retreating
  ：
 
  
footsteps.

Certain the coast was clear, Vincent had shoved the locker door open and stepped out.

Hannah had followed, her clothes disheveled, hair messy, cheeks flushed.

"Leave," Vincent had said sharply, his voice cold as he turned away, masking his inner conflict.

Hannah had hesitated, watching him. Then, with a decisive step, she crossed to the changing room door,locking it with a soft click. Turning back, she approached him and met his gaze with unwavering resolve,tiptoeing and wrapping her arms around his neck. "They're gone now. Don't you want to finish what we started?"
###Chapter 619 Their First Time


Vincent's chest had heaved, his breath heavy, his eyes locked on Hannah in silence.
Hannah had lost all patience with the waiting game. Bracing herself, she surged forward, shoving him down onto the bench behind him. "I'm done playing it safe, Vincent. I can't keep this bottled up anymore!"

Her bold move had shattered Vincent's restraint like glass. In a flash, he flipped the script, pinning her beneath him, his stare so fierce thatit could burn holes through her soul. "Hannah, you asked for this!"

And so, in that cramped changing room, without any defined relationship between them, Hannah and the man she'd always ached for, Vincent, had crossed a line they couldn't uncross.

That first time had been a wild, messy dance of youth-clumsy, impulsive, and ravenous.

Vincent had seemed innately skilled in this field, unrestrained, his desire raw and fierce.

They had been tangled up from the afternoon clear into the dead of night.

When Hannah finally stumbled out, her legs had been jelly, barely holding her up.

But the next day, when she tracked him down, the man who'd been all fire and heavy breaths the night before had gone. He was back to being Vincent, cold as ice.

Before she could get a word out, he'd pulled a check from his pocket, already filled out, and handed it to her. His voice was flat, like he was closing a deal. "Take this for last night."

Hannah had felt like she'd been doused with a bucket of cold water, chills running from head to toe. She grabbed the check and ripped it to shreds right in his face. "Vincent, we're grown-ups. We both wanted it.What? Did you take it seriously? You really think I need your money?" Her tone was deliberately casual.

Vincent had just stared at her, his eyes cóld as steel, not a flicker of feeling or explanation.

After that, Hannah had kept her distance, steering clear of him for a long stretch.

  ：
 
  

···
Hannah snapped out of her memories, her eyes locking back onto Vincent. His face was a mirror of that day after their first night together, when he'd handed her the check-distant, untouchable.

She looked at him and flashed a sudden grin. "Vincent, she's not as pretty as me."

Vincent's brow creased, thrown off by her words.

Hannah didn't let up, backing him up against the sink. "Mr. Jones, your taste in dates has taken a nosedive,hasn't it? Why not find someone better?"

It hit Vincent then-she thought he'd been on a date. Truth was, it was just a big-shot client, all business,no pleasure.But he wasn't about to clear the air. He sidestepped,ready to make his exit.

Hannah was quicker, darting to shut the men's room door from the inside. She stood firm, her back against the door, blocking his way out. "What, you can't stand a second alone with me now?"

Vincent's patience thinned, his voice sharp as a blade. "Can't you tell this is hardly the place for a private conversation? We're divorced, Hannah. This cingy act? It's desperate, and I find it utterly distasteful."

Hannah shot back, meeting his glare head-on,"I've pegged you as just as insufferable since you lost your memory."

"Feeling's mutual." Vincent wasn't in the mood to spar, trying again to push past her.

Hannah held her ground, keeping the door blocked, her voice abruptly softening like a breeze after a storm."I'm not trying to pull anything, Vincent. This isn't like the men's locker room back in college... I'm not going to do anything to you. Why are you bolting like I'm chasing you with a stick?"

Vincent froze at the mention of the locker room. What did she mean? Had something happened between them there?
Hannah caught the blank confusion in his eyes, and it stabbed at her heart like a splinter. Swallowing the flood of feelings, she got to the point. "Vincent, all I'm asking is for you to hit pause on dating for a bit."

She continued, "Just give me two weeks. If you still feel nothing for me and still can't stand the sight of me then, I swear, I'll vanish from your life for good. Gone, like I was never here.I mean it."

Vincent's face didn't soften one bit, a smirk tugging at his lips. "Who I date is my call, my right. You don't get to sway my decision."

Seeing him so firm, Hannah's frustration boiled over, her fist lightly punching his arm. "You can't grant me this one small favor? Not even for what we had-sleeping together and almost having a kid?"

"No." Vincent's tone left no room for negotiation.

Hannah's last spark of hope flickered out, her heart a tangled mess of hurt and anger. Without thinking,she kicked his shin. "Vincent, you're a complete jackass!"

Vincent flinched, pain flashing across his face, his eyes narrowing with irritation. "Stop being irrational."

He shoved her hand off the door, yanking the door open, and walking out without a backward glance.

Hannah reached for him, her fingers only grazing the edge of his jacket.

Watching his figure disappear down the hall, a bitter wave crashed over her, swallowing her heart whole. He didn't care about her anymore-not a shred of feeling left. All that love, the passion, the highs and lows-it was like they'd never happened. He really was a complete jackass.
###Chapter 620 Could That Man's Target Be Hannah


Vincent walked back into his table, his expression carved from stone, every line of his face tightened in controlled restraint. Before he could even lower himself into his chair, his sharp eyes caught a fleeting motion-a man at the next table discreetly dropping a small white pill into a glass of red wine.

Instinct flickered, but he quickly smothered it. He was not the sort who meddled in strangers' affairs. With practiced indifference, he took his seat, dismissing the matter from immediate thought.

Across the table, Amy Jimenez, the client he had kept waiting, leaned forward with a faint smile of curiosity."Mr. Jones, you were gone for quite some time. May I ask what delayed you?"

"Just a personal errand," Vincent replied smoothly, his tone calm and unreadable.′′Myapologies for your wait.Shall we continue?"

Yet, despite his outward composure, his focus fractured. From the corner of his eye, he caught sight of Hannah returning to the dining area. She slipped into a seat directly opposite the same man who had tampered with the wine moments earlier.

A muscle twitched in Vincent's jaw. Could that man's target be Hannah?

The thought sliced through him with unexpected force, stirring an irritation that he could neither explain nor suppress. How annoying.

Vincent's gaze darkened as he watched Hannah and that man raise their glasses. Whether through ignorance or misplaced trust, Hannah took several sips without hesitation. His fingers tightened against the table's edge, his frown deepening until his expression hardened completely.

Moments later, the brief meeting between Hannah and that man ended. After a short exchange, they rose and exited the restaurant together.
Vincent's face turned grim. He pulled out his phone and sent a message to Derek, who was waiting in the car. "Follow Hannah's car. Track her movements and ensure she's unharmed. Keep me updated every
Pushing aside his unease, Vincent turned back to the table, resuming the conversation with Amy.His responses were efficient, clipped, and professional. He finalized the cooperation details and signed the necessary documents without betraying distraction.

Once Amy departed, Vincent made his way to his car, where the heavy quiet pressed in as he waited for Derek's update. He told himself there was nothing to worry about. Derek was competent,cautious-there should be no cause for alarm.

But as minutes dragged into half an hour, and the silence stretched unbroken, a chill coiled tighter in Vincent's chest.

At last, his phone buzzed. He snatched it up, only for Derek's shaken voice to break through. "Mr. Jones-it's bad! We can't rush in. The man with Ms. Scott has influence-serious influence! He's taken her to the presidential suite on the top floor of the Parkview Hotel. From the looks of it, things might turn ugly. You might need to come personally!"

Vincent's jaw locked. "Useless," he hissed.

Logic told him to stay out of it. A clingy ex-wife was careless enough to drink from a glass tempered by a strange man. None of it warranted his interference.

But that cold reasoning was no match for the clawing dread beneath his ribs. A voice he couldn't silence warned him-if he didn't act now, he would regret it for the rest of his life.

The thought infuriated him, yet his body refused to obey his mind. "Keep watching them," he ordered curtly.
Then, without another word, he slammed the door of his car shut and sped toward the Parkview Hotel.

Within minutes, Vincent reached the top floor of the Parkview Hotel.

The corridor was lined with Derek and several bodyguards, their faces strained with tension.
"Mr. Jones!" Derek rushed to himn, speaking quickly and low. "The man who brougt Ms. Scott here is Rodney Griffin-the only son of Fred Griffin, chairman of Griffin Group. They're one of our main partners!"

  ：
 
  
He continued rapidly, "Rodney is notoriously lecherous. He's known for trapping female associates with drugs and coercion. Every victim's been ruined afterward. This hotel belongs to the Griffin family, and the top floor is reserved for him, with the staff answering to him. That's why we haven't dared storm in."

Vincent's expression darkened to something lethal. As he neared the room door, the muffled sound of coarse laughter seeped through the walls. A frigid fury radiated from him. "Break down the door."

Nate stepped forward to assess it, his tone grave. "Mr. Jones, this is a reinforced blast-proof door-custom-built. Normal tools won't work. To force it open, we'd need specialized gear and time."

Vincent's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Then find a way. I don't care what it takes-if you have to blast it apart, do it. Just get that door open-now."

"Understood!" Nate snapped, quickly mobilizing the team.

The hallway tensed under the sharp pressure of urgency.

Meanwhile, inside the suite's bedroom, Hannah groggily opened her eyes. Her head throbbed, and her body felt limp and powerless.

Her vision swam in and out of clarity before slowly sharpening, shapes and colors aligning into focus.

When awareness finally returned, terror struck her like a cold wave-there was a thin, wiry man leaning over her. As her sight steadied, recognition chilled her to the bone-it was Rodney, the very client she had been meeting with only hours ago to discuss business. Memory flared painfully clear: the car ride after dinner, the sudden fog in her mind, the dizzying heaviness pulling her under-and now, awakening here, in an unfamiliar hotel room.Realization struck like lightning. The drink had been drugged.

Now, she was sprawled across the bed, herlimbs weak, her wrists caught in the cruel grip of a red rope."Get off me!" she cried, mustering what strength she could, shoving at Rodney, but her body refused to obey.Her feeble attempts only seemed to inflame his excitement.

Rodney's lips twisted into a lewd grin as he pulled the rope tighter, his voice dripping with mockery. "Easy there, sweetheart. Let's get these hands tied first. Makes the game a little more interesting, don't you think?"
###Chapter 621 The Most Distinctive Woman


A lustful hunger blazed in Rodney's eyes as they traveled across Hannah's body.He nearly salivated."Your face, your figure... Ah, you are precisely my type! Don't fret, sweetheart, I'll take excellent care of you.l guarantee you'll have an incredible time." He smirked, creeping closer to her.

Unable to contain her revulsion, Hannah spat straight at his face.

Rather than becoming furious, Rodney appeared more aroused by her reaction. He actually protruded his tongue to taste the saliva from the edge of his mouth, breathing deeply as if relishing a delicacy. His face contorted into a perverted grin. "Wow, babe, even your saliva is delicious! Soon, I hope you'll be using that mouth for superior purposes."

With that, he forcefully seized Hannah's restrained hands, trying to direct them towards his towel-wrapped lower body.

Hannah's scalp prickled with repulsion, the disgust climbing to its zenith. Horrified and enraged, she recoiled sharply, yanking her hands free.

The drug's influence made her opposition weak, surges of vertigo washing over her. Frantically,she clamped down on her lower lip, exploiting the pain to grasp her final strand of consciousness.
Her thoughts whirled with horror and remorse. Who would have imagined that the man who had appeared so dignified, negotiating business contracts with her just hours earlier, was such a degenerate monster?

Her vision darted frantically around the room before ultimately fixing on the position of the bedroom door.She had to escape!

Compelling herself to stay composed, she suppressed the nausea and terror. "Restraining me is so tedious,Mr.Griffin. Don't you desire to experience something more thrilling?"
Rodney was clearly captivated by her suggestion, his leer becoming even more vile. "Something more thrilling? So you're drawn to that too? Well, you certainly understand how to tempt me! Tell me, what's more

  ：
 
  
thrilling?"

He paused his movements for an instant.

Hannah shifted her restrained wrists, giving them a gentle shake. "First, free my hands. With them bound,we can't explore all the options, can we?"

Rodney hesitated, a spark of suspicion in his eyes. "What if I untie you and you flee?"

Pretending a hazy expression, Hannah deliberately swayed her body."Look at me now, all feeble and limp,sensing heat and discomfort... I crave it too. Why would I flee? Furthermore..."

She motioned towards her feet, secured to the bed frame. "My legs are still restrained. I can't run away. If we're going to indulge, why not render it even more exhilarating?"

Utterly convinced by her compliant act, Rodney erupted into laughter. "Fascinating, very fascinating! You're the most distinctive woman I've ever encountered. Typically, those I lure into bed either weep and scream or just lie there like a corpse. But you're different. You don't weep or make a fuss, and you even grasp how to establish the atmosphere. This is going to be a very, very exhilarating experience! Perhaps we'll even have a second or third round."

As he uttered the vulgar words, he actually began to loosen the ropes on Hannah's wrists.

The instant her hands were freed, Hannah didn't waver. Despite her diminished state, she snatched a towel from the adjacent chair and rapidly blindfolded Rodney.

He stiffened for an instant and then grew even more excited. "Oh? Is this what you intended by more exhilarating?"
###Chapter 622 I'll Make You Pay


Hannah worked furiously at the knots biting into her ankles, her trembling fingers moving faster than her pulse. She forced her tone to stay calm, hiding her panic behind a brittle laugh."You don't understand-it's even more thrilling when you can't see a thing."

She needed Rodney to be unaware of her movement.

The instant the rope slipped free, she braced herself, muscles coiled, ready to spring from the bed and bolt for the door.

But Rodney, with that maddening grin stretching across his face, handed her a belt."Here, take this-let's make it rougher. Hit me with it."

Her stomach twisted, but she steadied her grip and swung. The belt cracked through the air like thunder,snapping against his bare back with brutal force.

A low,guttural moan rolled from Rodney's throat. "Yes! That's it-harder!"

Keeping her movements rhythmic, Hannah swung again and again, all the while shifting her weight toward the edge of the bed, inching closer to freedom.

At last, her fingertips brushed the cold metal of the door handle. She seized it, twisted hard-nothing.It rattled but refused to budge.

She turned again, desperate, but the mechanism wouldn't yield. A wave of hopelessness crashed over her.

Rodney, weary of the pretense, suddenly tore the blindfold from his eyes. When he saw her by the door,his grin only widened into a cruel sneer. "Trying to run off, huh? Cute-but pointless."

He rose unhurriedly, the towel around his waist falling to the floor as he stepped forward, shamelessly exposed. "This door's special. Without my voice command, it stays locked. So don't waste your energy."

A lewd laugh rippled from him as he advanced. "Forget the belt. Now, it's time to strip you."
  ：
 
  
Hannah backed away until her spine struck the wall.

Rodney reached out and tore the belt from her waist with a sharp yank."That's one piece gone," he announced triumphantly.

He ripped off her blazer next. "Two."

When his hands lunged for her shirt, her gaze darted toward the fruit knife glinting on the table. In a single motion, she lunged, seized the knife, and pointed its tip at Rodney, her voice trembling with rage."Don't take another step! I swNear, I'll gut you!"

Instead of fear, his eyes gleamed with perverse delight. He licked his lips and whispered darkly, "Blood?That makes it even better. I wonder if yours tastes as sweet as you look."

The drug coursing through Hannah's veins drained her strength. Her limbs felt heavy, her balance unsteady.She'd once trained in judo, but whatever power she had left wasn't enough to stop him. He deflected her attack with cruel ease.

Still, she gripped the knife tightly, her glare burning. "Rodney, you don't know who you're dealing with! I've never let anyone touch me against my will. If I have to die doingit, I'll take your manhood with me! Want to find out if I mean it?"

Her words were armor, stalling him, praying that Vincent might somehow sense she was in danger and come for her. But she quickly quashed that thought. How could he possibly come now? Having lost memories of her, he rather disliked her now. She made up her mind. If she couldn't flee,she'd make sure Rodney remembered her in pain.

Growing thrilled by her words, Rodney lunged."Let's see who wins-your knife or my desire."

His strength overwhelmed her. He grabbed her shoulders roughly, his breath hot against her face. "You drive me insane. Just the touch of you turns me on."

She gasped, twisting away, but he ripped at her shirt, tearing fabric and skin.

"Let go, you bastard!" Hannah screamed, stabbing desperately.
  ：
 
  
The blade plunged into his side, but didn't go far due to her weak arm.

Rodney winced, groaning. Blood welled up, bright and slick. He stared at it, then dipped a finger into the wound and licked it. "Tastes sweet enough."

He lunged again, ripping at her clothes with renewed fervor.

Hannah, trapped in panic and despair, swung the knife downward with a blind, savage motion.

A strangled howl tore from Rodney's throat-raw, piercing, agonized. He stumbled back, clutching his groin,eyes rolling with shock and pain.

Hannah seized the moment, staggering away. Her legs nearly gave out, and she caught herself against the wall, breathing in ragged gasps. Her vision swam, the room spinning like a carousel. Darkness crept at the edges of her sight.

She forced her teeth into her lip and, in a desperate act to stay conscious, gripped the blade itself.Pain lanced through her palm, blood dripping to the floor-but the sharpness snapped her back to reality. The knife trembled in her grip, bloodstained and cold, its tip pointed squarely at Rodney.

He writhed and then straightened with effort, rage twisting his face. "You filthy bitch, how dare you hurt me?I'll make you pay!"

Hannah pressed her back to the wall, whispering to herself through gritted teeth,"Stay awake... Don't black out now... Get out of here."

Just as Rodney's hand was about to grab her again, a deafening crash exploded from the suite's entrance.
###Chapter 623 Kissed By Her


The custom-built door burst apart with a deafening crash, fragments scattering across the floor.

From beyond the wreckage, a presence radiating raw menace crossed the threshold, the air itself seeming to contract in fear.

Vincent's expression was stormy, his gaze instantly locking onto Hannah. Without wasting a motion, he merely lifted his hand in a brief, deliberate gesture.

Nate and the bodyguards behind Vincent reacted instantly. Surging forward, they overpowered Rodney and forced him facedown with ease.

"Who the hell are you? Let go of me! Do you even know who my father is? The nerve of you treating me this way! He'll make you regret it!" Rodney roared, thrashing futilely under their grip.

"You're being too noisy," Vincent said, his tone laced with ice.

Catching the signal at once, Nate grabbed a towel from the floor and shoved it roughly into Rodney's mouth to silence him.

Vincent crouched beside Hannah. The reprimand that had risen to his lips died the instant he saw her disheveled state. Words deserted him entirely.

Recognition flickered in Hannah's eyes. The knife she had clutched so tightly slipped from her trembling fingers, clattering against the floor.

Then, her body collapsed forward, her forehead resting weakly against his shoulder as a faint murmur escaped her lips. "You finally came... I've been waiting for you."

The quiet statement struck directly at the most unguarded place in Vincent's heart. In that single moment,reason shattered-his fragmented memory, their failed marriage, the complications-all of it disintegrated.

For the first time, he had felt his heart dissolve into a vulnerable warmth under the weight of her trust. He

  ：
 
  
froze briefly and then instinctively drew her trembling frame into a careful embrace.

...

Vincent swiftly lifted Hannah and carried her to his car, laying her tenderly across the back seat. He noticed blood seeping from her palms, the cut clean and deep-a telltale sign that she had gripped the knife's edge on purpose.

He understood instantly. She had used pain as her last defense against the drug, fighting to remain conscious. A sharp ache tore through his chest at the realization.

Without hesitation, he yanked off his tie and wrapped it firmly around her injured hands to stop the bleeding.

IHannah's mind blurred further under the drug's influence, her strength waning. Fever heat rolled off her skin as she shifted restlessly in his arms, unable to stay still. Her fingers twitched upward unconsciously,trembling as she began to fumble with the buttons of his shirt.

Vincent caught her wrist firmly."Don't move."

"I'm not comfortable... It's burning..." she murmured, her voice trembling, tugging at her blouse.

Once again, he restrained her, his eyes darkening wvith turmoil. He could tell-the drug had taken full hold.Raising his head, he gave a curt order to the driver."Derek, faster."

"Yes, Mr. Jones!" Derek responded, flooring the accelerator as the car tore through the night.

Before long, they arrived at Sterling Heights.

Derek, reading the situation, chose not to follow them upstairs.

Vincent lifted Hannah, who clung desperately to him, whispering incoherent fragments that told him her apartment was on the twenty-second floor.

But when they reached the apartment door, it became clear she couldn't enter-she was far too dazed to speak the password, and even her fingerprints failed to unlock the sensor.

Hannah's gaze never left him. She held onto him tightly, lifting her face toward his in a feverish attempt to

  ：
 
  
kiss him, her focus utterly consumed by him.

Vincent's composure frayed as her soft body pressed against him, her warmth seeping through his restraint, leaving him with no clear escape from the chaos of desire and conscience.

Then, a flash of memory surfaced-Derek had once mentioned he owned an apartment here. He immediately pulled out his phone. "Derek, which floor is my unit at Sterling Heights?"

"Mr. Jones," Derek replied quickly, "it's right below Ms. Scott's-twenty-first floor, unit twenty-one-zero-one.The password should be the one you usually use."

Without another thought, Vincent turned and descended one floor, Hannah still in his arms. The door unlocked with a soft electronic tone as he entered the familiar code.

He walked inside but paused after a few steps, taking in the scene.

The apartment radiated warmth-a comforting simplicity touched with traces of femininity: patterned cushions on the couch, thriving plants by the window, and glossy fashion magazines scattered across the coffee table.

It didn't align with the austere, minimalist taste he thought was his own. Instead, it felt intimate, as though he had once shared it with someone he cherished.Could this place really be the home he'd prepared just to pursue Hannah?

The question had barely formed when Hannah, eyes clouded with longing, suddenly pushed him hard against the door. "I can't hold it back anymor111she whispered, standing on tiptoe as her palms framed his face,her gaze dazed and fervent.

Before he could react, her lips crashed against his-urgent, unrestrained, and burning with desperation.

Vincent froze, his thoughts scattering into silence.

Her kiss was wild, her tongue forcing its way past his parted lips, seeking him, tasting him, consuming the air between them.

His entire body went rigid; self-control wavered for a heartbeat, and against his will, he found himself
 
answering her kiss-helplessly, instinctively, drawn into the storm she had become.
###Chapter 624 Send Up A Male Escort For Me


The next second, Vincent turned his face sharply aside, his hand pushing Hannah away in a burst of remaining restraint. His tone came out ragged, threaded with irritation as he snapped, "Hannah, you've crossed a line!"

But Hannah wasn't listening to any of his words now. Whatever he said was drowned out by the pounding in her veins-an ache driven by instinct and raw need that silenced reason entirely.

In a feverish blur, Hannah began clawing at her clothes-heels flying off; buttons scattering across the tiles,her zipper sliding down with trembling haste-until each discarded piece of fabric littered the floor like fallen petals.

Just as her shaking fingers moved toward the last piece of clothing, Vincent lunged forward, swept her up effortlessly, and carried her straight toward the bathroom. Without hesitation, he set her down inside the bathtub, his movements firm, almost harsh.

Hannah blinked at him in dazed confusion, her mind too clouded to interpret his sudden intervention.

In the next heartbeat, Vincent seized the showerhead and twisted the handle. A rush of icy water burst forth, drenching her from head to toe.

Her startled cry echoed through the tiled room as the freezing cascade shocked her body into awareness,each droplet biting against her feverish skin.

She wiped her dripping face, eyes blinking rapidly toward Vincent, whose taut expression revealed both anger and unease. Though the chill cleared her thoughts slightly, the fire surging through her body refused to die. Her hand shot out suddenly,clutching his suit jacket with desperate force.

The unexpected pull threw him off balance, and before he could catch himself, he stumbled, falling straight into the wide tub beside her.

Leaning close, Hannah's breath fanned against his ear, still searingly hot. "I was drugged," she murmured

  ：
 
  
between gasps. "I can't take it anymore. Help me. Have sex with me."

Her tongue flicked teasingly along the curve of his earlobe, her every motion meant to unravel his control.

Vincent's throat tightened; his Adam's apple shifted visibly as her words and touch clawed at his composure. His voice came out strained, rough-edged. "Is this how reckless you always are?"

He leaned in, pressing her lightly yet firmly against the cold porcelain wall.

Hannah tilted her chin upward, her gaze shimmering between dreamlike haze and solemn intensity."Reckless?" she whispered. "No. It's only because it's you that I am willing to have-sex with."

She leaned closer, their lips separated by a mere breath."So, Vincent, what's your answer? Yes or no?"

For a split second, his eyes darkened, the battle within him dangerously close to surrender. But sheer self-restraint forced him back from the edge.

He rose abruptly, turning away, his soaked clothes clinging to him as he fished out his phone with rigid precision. "I'm calling a doctor," he said, steadying his tone with effort. "You need medical help."

He pressed a number and barked into the receiver, "Derek, find a reliable doctor-send him to my apartment immediately."

The words pierced through the haze clouding Hannah's senses. Her pulse faltered; the sting of rejection hit harder than the cold water. He didn't want her.

Watching his turned back, her eyes dimmed, the faint glimmer of hope collapsing into a quiet, bitter emptiness. Silently, she peeled off the last fragments of her clothing and tossed them beyond the rim of the tub, her movements slow, deliberate. Her voice came next-soft, unnervingly even. "Forget the doctor."

Vincent pivoted around in confusion, only to freeze mid-motion at the sight of her-bare, motionless beneath the running water.

His breath hitched sharply; he averted his gaze at once, anger cutting through the tension. "Hannah! What the hell do you think you're doing?"

Her tone remained chillingly calm. "I said no doctor. Just send up a male escort for me."
  ：
 
  
She paused briefly, her lips curving faintly with a hint of defiance. "Make sure he's good-looking. Maybe two.I'll pay."

The words landed like stones-both on Vincent and on Derek, who had heard everything through the line.

On the other end, Derek's shocked exhale filled the silence, his thoughts racing. Vincent really wasn't responding? She was practically begging, anid he was still unmoved?

Trying to provoke Vincent, Derek ventured carefully, "Mr. Jones, should I send two then?"

"Shut up!" Vincent snarled, slamming the phone shut with enough force to echo, Rage boiled in him-rage he couldn't explain, except that the idea of her wanting someone else tore through his restraint like flame through dry wood.

Seething,he turned toward the door, his words curt and furious. "Do whatever you damn well want."

But when Hannah realized he truly meant to leave, her own fury ignited. She raised her voice deliberately,every word sharp enough to wound. "Then tell Derek to hurry! I expect them waiting by the time I'm out of the bath!"
###Chapter 625 To Sleep With You


Vincent halted at the threshold of the bathroom, his pulse hammering so fiercely that the veins on his forehead stood out like cords.

Just when Hannah thought he had finally left, the door swung open, cutting through the quiet with a sudden thud.

Vincent reentered, his stride swift and purposeful as he crossed the tiles toward the bathtub.

Before Hannah could even gather her scattered thoughts, he leaned down abruptly, one hand rising to cradle her face with firm gentleness before his mouth captured hers in a fierce, consuming kiss.

There was punishment in that kiss-a wild, demanding heat that bordered on cruelty, stealing the breath from her lungs.

"Mmm-" The sound slipped from Hannah's lips as her head swam. When she finally tore herself free,her voice trembled with both confusion and disbelief."What are you trying to do?"

Vincent's eyes were shadowed, dark, and unwavering."To sleep with you."

He uttered the words lowly, and before Hannah could process them, his lips captured hers again, cutting off any thought, any protest, any escape.

But this time, the cold restraint that had once defined him was gone-replaced by raw, unfiltered longing.

As Hannah comprehended what was unfolding, a storm of feelings churned within her-confusion, anger,and a dizzying ache she couldn't name. Her fingers found the edge of his drenched shirt, clutching it with sudden resolve before tugging him downward into the bathtub.

In the narrow space, their bodies collided, tangled, and fused together, each breath feeding the flame that consumed them.

As their movements deepened, flashes of fractured memory jolted through Vincent's mind-familiar, vivid,

  ：
 
  
and alarmingly similar to another confined place where desire had stripped away reason and left nothing untouched.

Those images came in shards-heat, touch, hunger-and each fragment carried that same merciless pull.And in every echo of recollection, he was the one who was never satisfied, always craving more.

This realization drove him even more wild.

When they stumbled out of the bathroom, their fervor didn't fade-it spread, trailing across the living room,the dining table, and at last, the wide expanse of the bed, leaving a path of reckless intimacy behind them.

Vincent's need seemed endless; he marked every inch of Hannah's skin, branding her with the proof of his presence.

Blurred memories assaulted him again-it felt as though he had done this countless times before, taking her in various places, losing control the same way.

For the first time, Vincent had woken later than usual. The sunlight was already bright when he opened his eyes, and the space beside him was empty-Hannah was gone.

He pushed himself upright, pressing his hand against his temple, an ache of regret settling deep within him.How had he been the one to cross that line first? HHe, who always avoided attachments and detested emotional entanglement, had surrendered to impulse like a man possessed.

Last night, he hadn't just given in-he had devoured every restraint, burning until wee hours like someone half his age. It was entirely unlike him.

Maybe it was because she had provoked him, claiming to want another man with such careless defiance that something primal in him had snapped. He tried to rationalize it-to name it anger, not longing for her.

Frustrated, Vincent dragged a hand through his hair and reached for his phone. "Derek. What's on the agenda today?"

Derek's voice came crisp as he relayed the agenda. Then, he added, "Mr. Jones, nothing pressing at the company today. You could afford a few hours of rest and maybe even spend them with someone deservng of your attention?"

  ：
 
  
There was a knowing lilt beneath his polite tone.

Vincent's expression darkened. "Since when do mny private affairs require your suggestion?"

Derek instantly backtracked. "Of course not. I meant nothing of the sort."

A silence stretched between them before Vincent asked with feigned casualness, "And her?"Derek caught on immediately. "Ms. Scott? She's gone to see Rodney."

Vincent's brow furrowed at once, irritation flickering in his voice. "Rodney? What business does she have with that scum?"

"Mr. Jones, no need to be concerned," Derek rushed to assure him. "Rodney's under close watch by our men. Ms. Scott likely just wants a few answers. There's no danger."

"Who said I'm worried about her?" Vincent's tone snapped cold, yet his next words betrayed him. "Send me the address."

Derek was confused. "Huh? What address?"

"The place where Rodney's being held!" Vincent's voice sharpened, leaving no room for delay.

"Sending it right away!" Derek replied quickly, his lips curving in secret amusement.

Vincent could insist all he wanted, but Derek knew better-Vincent was anything but indifferent.Beneath the ice,he was terrified Hannah would get hurt.

Meanwhile, Hannah had already stepped into a soundproof conference room within one of the Jones Group's hotels.

Inside, Rodney sat bound tightly to a chair, his mouth gagged with a rough cloth, his muffled grunts the only sound in the room.

Nate stood by with several guards, and upon spotting Hannah, he immediately inclined his head respectfully."Ms. Scott."

Hannah's nod was slight, her gaze cutting to the disheveled figure of Rodney with icy composure.

  ：
 
  
At her signal, Nate motioned for one of the men to remove the gag.

The moment Rodney could speak, a crooked grin twisted across his face. "Ah, Ms. Scott. How nice of you to visit. How was the special treat I prepared for you last night? Wasn't it exhilarating? Tell me-was Vincent the lucky guy?"

Before another vile word could escape him, Hannah's hand struck sharply across his cheek.The sound cracked through the room as his head snapped to the side.
###Chapter 626 You Won't Get That Chance


Rodney's tongue slid across the corner of his mouth before his laughter deepened into something dark and obscene. "Heh, even your slap carries a sweet scent. Words mean nothing compared to touch. You're only turning me on, Hannah-every strike of yours just excites me more."

"Degenerate!" Hannah snapped, her voice dripping with disgust as she spat toward him.

"Ah, I'll take that as praise," Rodney replied, his grin warping into something even more vile.

Hannah straightened her posture, her disgust crystallizing into cold resolve. Her eyes cut away from Rodney's loathsome face as she gave a flat command to Nate, her tone frosted with contempt. "Beat him to a pulp. I don't want him dead, but don't hold back either."

"Yes, Ms. Scott!" Nate answered at once. The pent-up rage he'd long harbored toward Rodney burst loose as he signaled his men forward.

In seconds, fists crashed down like a storm. Rodney barked curses at first, but the defiance drained fast,replaced by desperate howls and broken pleas.

Before long,Rodney was nothing but a battered heap-his skin swvollen and bruised, blood seeping from the corner of his split lip.

"You... You'll regret this," Rodney gasped between ragged breaths, his eyes burning with venom as they swept the room. "You have no idea who you're dealing with. My family's reach goes beyond your imagination! I'll make sure every one of you pays!"

His gaze finally locked onto Hannah. "And you, Ms. Scott... I won't kill you. But I'll make sure every day of your life feels worse than death."

Hannah, seated gracefully on the sofa, gave a soft, derisive laugh."That sounds ambitious. Too bad you won't get the chance."

She pulled out her phone and spoke smoothly into it.′′Officer Mercer, you've received the restaurant surveillance footage I provided, along with the signed statements and medical records from the women he has drugged and assaulted before, correct? Good. You can come arrest him now-we've caught him."

Earlier this morning, Hannah had managed to obtain crystal-clear footage showing Rodney discreetly slipping drugs into her glass at the restaurant. Quietly, she had arranged for her team to reach out to the women he had preyed upon, gathering their testimonies and verified evidence. This time,there would be no escape for Rodney-every thread of proof was airtight.

Rodney froze for a beat at the mention of the police and then suddenly broke into mocking laughter."You called the cops? Ha-ha! Oh, Hannah, do you really think those women haven't reported me before? Every time,I walked out without a scratch. Want to know why?"

His voice rose with swaggering arrogance.′′Afew hours behind bars, that's all. Then, I'll be released again,doing exactly what I please. I'll continue to take whatever woman I want-including you. You'll see. I always get what I want."

Hannah's fury surged, her expression tightening with icy rage. "Rodney Griffin," she questioned, every syllable sharp with contempt, "are you truly unafraid of karma?"

"Karma?" Rodney threw his head back and laughed as if she'd told a joke. "Ha-ha! What hell? My family's influence protects me from any consequence!"

That final, twisted boast shattered the last remnant of Hannah's restraint. She rose abruptly, her heels clacking against the floor as she strode toward him. Without hesitation, she swung her leg and drove her heel savagely into his crotch.

"Ahhh-" Rodney's scream tore through the room, his body thrashing helplessly as the chair rocked under him.

Hannah inserted more strength into her foot until her breath quickened and her anger cooled slightly. Then,she stepped back, smoothing the loose strands of her hair.11SO1how does that feel? Not quite as thrilling now, is it? I'll make sure you never have the chance to hurt another woman again."

Her eyes flicked toward a nearby guard, spotting the dagger strapped to his belt. She plucked it free with deliberate calm. Rodney's bravado finally cracked. Panic flashed across his face."You... You can't do this to me! Hannah, this is murder! My father will destroy you if you touch me!"

"Oh?" Hannah tilted her head, lightly tracing the dagger's tip across his cheek with chilling amusement.′′SO1you can feel fear after all. What happened to that unshakable confidence earlier? | thought your family could shield you even in hell."

Her voice went cold. Without hesitation, she raised the blade and drove it downward toward his groin.

Rodney's scream was raw and guttural, echoing off the walls as the chair toppled backward, slamming to the floor.

His private parts, already injured by Hannah from the previous night and trampled by her heel today,couldn't stand the new agony of the knife driving in. He twisted his body into violent spasms as blood spread across his lower half.

Hannah dropped the stained dagger onto the floor with a dull clang, then calmly drew out a tissue and wiped her hands clean. "Let's see what you'll use to mistreat women now," she said, her voice cool and cutting.

Rodney lay trembling, his face ghostly pale. With what little strength remained, he croaked through clenched teeth, "H-Hannah... you'll rot in prison!"

Hannah looked down at him with a disdainful half-smile, as though regarding something filthy."I have money. Enough to bury any charge under lawyers and influence. You think prison frightens me?"

She crouched beside him, her tone dripping with icy cruelty. "But you... Even if you crawl out of that police cell later on, you'll be nothing but a pitiful shadow. Imagine how others will see you? A disgrace. A man in name only."

Just then, Vincent arrived, his eyes widening as he froze, having witnessed the entire ordeal unfold before him through the glass door.
###Chapter 627 An Unfamiliar Pull


Vincent halted at the threshold, resisting the urge to step inside. He lingered in the corridor instead, his figure still and silent, eyes carrying a weight that hinted at the storm beneath his composure.

Just now, Hannah had moved with startling precision, her every motion sharp and decisive, wasting neither thought nor second. The dagger had flashed in her grasp as she struck at Rodney-swift, merciless, and laced with a ferocity that shocked even the air around her.

Yet, as Vincent observed her, something inexplicable had coursed through him-a rush of adrenaline that was both disturbing and intoxicating.

A fragmented image flickered in his memory-dim surroundings, Hannah again clutching something metallic and glinting, her expression carved with desperation and fierce resolve, her gaze fixed on a man's lower body.

He faintly remembered he had surged forward, wrapping an arm around her from behind, shielding her sight with his palm while whispering close to her ear, "Don't look."

That recollection dissolved as soon as it surfaced, leaving behind nothing but the echo of ache and the lingering weight of protectiveness that gripped his heart.

His focus returned to Hannah before him, steady, unflinching, the edge of her profile lit with determination.He could feel his own pulse hammering uncontrollably, thudding against his ribs like a confession he couldn't voice.

At that instant, Vincent saw a side of her he'd never truly noticed before-a side that was dangerously magnetic, commanding, and alive with a dark kind of grace. Uncompromising. Fearless. Unforgiving. It dawned on him that this might be the first time he'd genuinely seen Hannah.

Derek stood nearby, frozen by what he'd witnessed. His breath caught as he sneaked a cautious glance toward Vincent. Vincent's face had become unreadable-calm to the point of menace, his eyes veiled beneath a chilling composure that revealed nothing. Unease tightened in Derek's chest. Panic began to creep in. Was Vincent displeased by Hannah's ruthlessness? Did he perhaps even fear her?

Trying to salvage the situation, Derek murmured hesitantly, "Mr. Jones, Ms. Scott usually isn't like this.She's actually very level-headed. Rodney just... He pushed her too far this time. She lost her temper, that's all."

Vincent said nothing. He didn't even glance at Derek-his attention fixed wholly on Hannah.

Seeing that Vincent remained silent, his expression still dark and unreadable, Derek surmised that Vincent was angry. He fell quiet, convinced that any further explanation might only make things worse.

Then, Derek's phone buzzed in his pocket. He glanced down, his face shifting slightly as he saw the name flashing on the screen. Stepping aside, he answered in haste. Moments later, he returned, lowering his voice as he reported, "Mr. Jones, Rodney's father-Fred Griffin, the chairman of Griffin Group-just called.He'd like to arrange a meeting with you about his son's situation."

Vincent finally tore his gaze from Hannah, turned smoothly, and began walking away. His tone was devoid of inflection as he replied, "Tell him to pick the location."

Derek blinked in surprise before rushing after him. "Mr. Jones, aren't you going to go inside and check on Ms. Scott before you go?" He'd assumed Vincent would at least speak to Hannah before leaving.

Without breaking stride, Vincent responded flatly, "I didn't come here for her."

But inside, his composure was unraveling. A confusing storm of emotion churned beneath the surface-desire, tension, and a rawN, unfamiliar pull that unsettled him deeply. He needed distance-space to think, to breathe, to regain control.

As Vincent's figure disappeared down the corridor, Derek exhaled a silent sigh. Things were spiraling.Whatever progress had been made the night before seemed to have dissolved completely, leaving behind nothing but strain and silence between Vincent and Hannah.


******

The meeting between Vincent and Fred was set in motion later that day, at an exclusive private club tucked discreetly behind a line of towering cypress trees.

Vincent arrived late, as if time itself bowed to his schedule.

Fred, who had been waiting nervously, rose the instant Vincent entered, his ingratiating smile already in place. "Mr. Jones, you're finally here. Please, make yourself comfortable."

Vincent took the seat at the head of the table, expression unreadable, his silence commanding the room far more effectively than words.

At Fred's clap, the door opened to reveal a group of young women, dressed proyocatively and smiling with feigned sweetness. They drifted toward Vincent, laughter delicate but hollow.

The air shifted instantly-tense, electric. Vincent's cold gaze sliced across the room before fixing on Fred.His voice, sharp and frigid, broke the silence, asking, "WVhat is the meaning of this, Mr. Griffin?"

Fred's grin faltered, panic flashing behind his eyes."Ah-Mr. Jones, you don't like them? I can have them replaced with someone more... suitable."

"Stop wasting my time," Vincent said, his tone cutting clean through the room's air. "Say what you came here to say. I don't indulge in theatrics."
###Chapter 628 His Wrath


Fred gave a hollow, almost mechanical laugh before forcing the conversation to its core. "Mr. Jones, you're straightforward, so let me be blunt. My son, Rodney-an endless source of frustration to his mother and me -seems to have provoked your anger last night and somehow ended up under your custody. I'd like to know when I can take him back from your hands. His mother's beside herself, and if I don't get him home soon,our household will erupt into chaos."

Vincent raised his teacup, gently blew on it, and replied in a voice that carried a faint amusement, "Your son,you say? I thought Rodney was just some unhinged stray-foaming at the mouth and snapping at anything that moved."

Fred's face fell with humiliation. He forced a grin that looked more like pain than politeness. "Ha... Mr. Jones,you surely know how to joke. He's our only child-spoiled, pampered, never learned restraint. He's always been a little wild, especially around women. But last night, he was only indulging in harmless fun at our own hotel. Wasn't it somewhat inappropriate for you to storm in with your men like that?"

Vincent's gaze sharpened, his eyes narrowing to a dangerous slit. He placed the cup down with deliberate calm and rose from his seat.

Crossing the space between them, Vincent reached for the cigarette pack on the table, drew one out,and struck a light. Before Fred could even register the movement, he pressed the glowing tip against the back of his exposed hand.

A soft sizzle broke the silence.

"Ah!" Fred's scream tore through the air. He yanked his hand back, the skin scorched and smoking.

Vincent looked down at Fred, his expression unreadable, his tone carrying the weight of cold authority.′′YOU think you can lecture me on what's proper? Let me make something clear, Fred. Your son didn't just misstep -he has crossed someone he shouldn't have. This time, neither your influence nor your money will shield him.And if you keep testing me, you won't survive it either." Vincent turned on his heel and strode toward the exit, the sound of his boots echoing in the stunned silence.

Derek immediately fell in behind him, his face pale.

Once they were outside and settled in the car, Vincent's voice cut through the tension with calm precision."Find out everything-every name, every ally backing the Griffin family. I want their entire foundation torn apart. The Griffin Group is finished."

A chill swept through Derek's chest. He straightened instantly. "Understood, Mr. Jones."

Derek sensed that this time, Vincent's wrath was absolute. Fred had stepped on the one nerve no one dared touch.

******

At the same time, Rodney had been officially taken in by the police for questioning.

Hannah directed Nate to prioritize the safety of the women who had come forward with medical records and signed statements-to ensure they and their families remained untouchable by any retaliation from the Griffins.

Once the crisis had been contained, she returned to her duties at Luminara Group, immersing herself completely in work.

She neither called Vincent nor received any message from him in the past two days. She focused all her attention on her work.

However, the uproar surrounding Rodney's case was far from over.

That day, a court summons landed on her desk-Fred was suing her for intentional assault.

To make matters worse, word of her private handling of Rodney somehow slipped into company channels,spreading like wildfire among Luminara Group's upper management.

A few executives who had long been dissatisfied with Hannah's leadership seized the moment to convene an emergency board meeting, citing "ethical misconduct" and"∈proper professional behavior." The atmosphere inside the conference room was razor-tight.

Seated around the table were the key figures of the company: Adrian, her trusted deputy; and Hodge Carman, the newly appointed vice chairman whose hostility toward Hannah was barely concealed.

Hodge was the first to strike. "Ms. Scott, what you did was reckless. Do you even realize the damage?Griffin Group is a major potential partner, and their distribution network is crucial for our next expansion phase!"

An executive quickly backed him. "Exactly! Our industry thrives on alliances, not conflict. By sending Rodney to the authorities and handling things so aggressively, you've burned a valuable bridge and jeopardized our strategic interests! You're ignoring the overall interests.of the company, lacking a sense of the bigger picture!"

"Indeed!" Hodge's tone grew sharper with every word."Our company is at a turning point, Ms. Scott. Every opportunity matters. Yet, you chose to ruin a partnership just to satisfy some personal grudge!"

Through their tirade, Hannah remained still, seated at the head of the table. Her expression was unreadable,her composure unnerving. Once they finished their statement, she let out a quiet, mirthless laugh. "That's easy for you to say."

Leaning forward slightly, she pinned Hodge with a piercing stare, her voice edged with cold amusement."SO let me get this straight-you think Rodney drugging me and trying to violate me was no biggie? Listening to you,one might almost think you're disappointed I didn't go through with it. Would that have made you feel better if I'd just traded my body to close the business deal?"
###Chapter 629 You're Dismissed


The instant Hannah's words cut through the air, the entire conference room froze into a heavy, stifling silence.

Several executives exchanged uneasy glances, their faces darkening with visible discomfort-her blunt words had struck too deep, too mercilessly.

Hodge's complexion turned crimson, an ugly blend of rage and embarrassment twisting his expression as he snapped, "Ms. Scott, please don't twist our words. That's not what any of us implied! What we're trying to say is that there were gentler, more diplomatic ways to resolve this issue. You were far too forceful, and that's exactly what dragged us into this crisis!"

"Oh? So, I got the wrong idea about what you mean?" Hannah's voice rose, clear and sharp. "Then enlighten me. Because what I heard was that since

Rodney didn't get his way with me, the project collapsed, and I'm the convenient culprit for the company's losses-isn't that what you're suggesting?"

Silence pressed in once more-no one dared breathe a word.

Hannah pushed back her chair and stood, both palms resting on the polished table. Her gaze swept over the room like a storm front. "Tell me, when did Luminara Group sink to the point where óur CEO must sell themselves and crawl into bed with degenerates just to close a deal? Doing business with filth like that is beneath us," she said, her voice edged with scorn.
Hodge's chest tightened beneaththe weight of her presence, yet his stubborn pride refused to yield. His eyes darted to the stock graph projected on the wall -its plummeting red line feeding his indignation.
Grinding his teeth, he shot back, "Ms. Scott, why get worked up? I didn't say anything wrong, did l? If you hadn't gone overboard and injured Rodney-and his

private parts-would you be staring down a law/suit right now? Take a look for yourself! The stock price has been dropping since yesterday! This entire mess is your fault!"

He jabbed a finger toward the graph, his tone rising in accusation. "And as if that wasn't enough, you've completely alienated the Griffin family's only son!The partnership we spent years securing is gone!Ever since your return, everything has been in disarray. Honestly, we would've been better off if you'd just stayed abroad and never come back!"

The words hit like daggers, branding Hannah as a burden.

Murmurs rippled through the room as the executives began whispering among themselves, their attention flitting nervously between Hodge and Hannah.

Hannah's expression cooled to ice. She could tolerate differing opinions, but not a selfish agenda dressed as reason. Hodge's intent to pin the blame on a victim, to imply she should have stayed away for daring to stand her ground, revealed what truly

 endangered the company-it was not her leadership,but his presence. Such a man, holding power,was the real liability.

With deliberate calm, she lowered herself back into her seat, her gaze no longer acknowledging Hodge.Instead, she addressed the room at large, her tone measured yet firm, "A temporary dip in stock value is hardly catastrophic. Losing the Griffin Group's channel is unfortunate, but not the end of the world.As for Mr. Carman..."

She paused, and when her eyes met Hodge's again,they were as sharp and cold as glass. "It seems you lack both the confidence and respect required for this company/'s future-and for me, as its CEO. Since you believe my return was a mnistake, I'll make things simple. You are no longer needed here. Effective immediately, you're dismissed. Gather your belongings and settle with Finance."

Her words cracked through the silence like thunder,reverberating off the walls.

  
  .
Hodge stiffened, disbelief etched across his face. His resentment toward Hannah's return-since it stripped him of authority-had fueled his rebellion today. He'd only meant to vent his anger, not lose everything in a single stroke. Panic flickered in his eyes. "Hannah Scott, you can't do this to me! I was only voicing valid concerns for the company's sake!And for that,you're firing me?"

His voice grew louder, trembling with desperation and fury. "Do you have any idea how much revenue I've generated these past two months? And how many major contracts l've secured? Without me,Luminara wouldn't even be where it is now! You can't just toss me aside like this! What gives you the right to run things like a dictator?"

Hannah's expression didn't waver. She didn't even glance in his direction. Her voice came out cool and detached."Security. Please escort Mr. Carman out."

The two guards stationed by the door immediately approached Hodge.
  
  .
Seeing them move, Hodge's outrage erupted. He slammed his fist against the table. "Don't you dare touch me! I'm the deputy chairman of this group!"

He turned sharply toward Hannah, glaring."You think this ends here? I'll call for a special shareholders'meeting! I refuse to believe you can dismiss a deputy chairman who's contributed this much without consequence. You don't have that kind of authority!"

His last words were a desperate attempt to claw back relevance, convinced that the shareholders would take his side.

At that moment, Adrian rose from his seat. Adjusting his glasses with a calm, almost pitying air, he said evenly, "Mr. Carman, perhaps you're unaware of the company's current equity structure."

He let the words hang for a beat before continuing,glancing around the entire board, "Ms. Scott is not merely the CEO. She also holds the largest individual stake in Luminara Group, granting her full control over company affairs. In other words-she is the chairperson."
###Chapter 630 Counterattack


Adrian's expression remained composed as he faced the stunned Hodge, his tone precise and merciless."Even if a shareholders' assembly is convened, Ms.Scott retains veto authority. Her judgment is final.There will he no anneal no neaotiation Neither the

The security team immediately stepped forward,seizing Hodge by the arms and dragging him from the room with brisk indifference.

The heavy doors shut behind them, sealing the air in a profound,echoing silence.

Hannah exhaled quietly and turned to her secretary."Display our contingency proposal," she instructed."The development initiative for self-operated distribution across the Southern Peninsula-put it on screen for everyone."

She had foreseen resistance from the Griffin Group and had crafted a parallel strategy well in advance.What she hadn't expected was to unveil it under such charged circumstances.

As the projection flickered to life, she surveyed the faces of those seated around the long table-executives frozen between awe and dread. Her voice carried a calm steeliness as she declared, "Luminara Group's destiny will never hinge on a tainted family's influence. We carve our own way forward."
Not a single person dared to meet her gaze. Heads lowered in unison, their silence spoke volumes.

Hannah's composure remained unshaken as she continued, her tone resuming its firm authority, "Now,does anyone have objections regarding my dealing with Rodney-or any aspect of my decision?"

The room remained void of response.

The meeting concluded under the oppressive hush of submission.

Back in her office, Hannah sank into her chair,rubbing her temples as the adrenaline ebbed away.Though she had stamped out dissent for now, the weight of the peding lawsuit and the continuing plunge in stock value pressed against her mind like an invisible vice.

Her phone rang suddenly-an unfamiliar number flashing across the screen.

When she answered, a composed male voice came through. "Ms. Scott, this is Lennon Brooks, chief legal advisor to Mr. Jones. I'm contacting you on his behalf regarding your lawsuit. Mr. Jones has instructed our firm to take over completely. Please be assured-Fred will not prevail. Also, Mr. Jones asked me to inform you that he is acquiring the dispersed shares and bonds of Griffin Group. Before long, the Griffin family will lose any leverage to trouble you."

For a long moment, Hannah remained still, the phone warm against her ear. Vincent had orchestrated all of this for her. Something stirred within her chest-a brief, delicate tremor of emotion she couldn't easily name.


Though the boardroom battle had ended in Hannah's favor, outward compliance was no guarantee of true loyalty.

Within hours, the company's lounges and private chat threads buzzed with murmurs of discontent.

"The stock keeps crashing, and Hannah is acting like it's nothing-just firing people to flex her authority?" "She dared to cross the Griffin Group, severed our biggest distribution link, and still believes she's justified?"

"Wait till the next shareholders' meeting.Chairwoman or not, she won't be untouchable for long. They'll find a way to oust her. Just watch."

The whispers inevitably reached Hannah's ears. Her only response was a faint, dismissive smile. A temporary decline in stock didn't frighten her-it was within her expectations. And, more importantly, it was reversible. Her preparations were already in motion.

Turning to her secretary, who had been standing patiently nearby, she asked coolly, "Did you reach out to the media outlets as instructed?"

The secretary handed over a tablet. "Yes, Ms. Scott.Every major publication has been contacted. Here are the draft articles derived from the evidence we provided. They focus on Rodney's long history of abusing his authority to harass women and portray your stand as both courageous and just. Each piece
  
emphasizes Luminara Group's ethical stance and refusal to align with corruption. Please review."

Hannah scrolled through several of the drafts,reading each headline and opening paragraph with sharp precision. The tone was correct-powerful,sympathetic, and direct. Satisfied, she returned the tablet and gave a crisp order. "Good. Inform them to release it immediately. I want this story to flood every major platform withinthe hour. Also, have our digital partners push the narrative-focus on Rodney's misconduct, minimize the corporate angle, and keep our official account's comment section tightly moderated."

"Understood, Ms. Scott." The secretary departed to carry out her command.

Hours later, as the campaign swept across social media, public sentiment flipped like a coin. The tide,once hostile and uncertain, now roared in Hannah's favor.
###Chapter 631 She Was So Indifferent To Him


"The Only Son of the Griffin Family Exposed as a Serial Offender" and "Luminara Group's CEO Hannah Scott's Bold Counterstrike" rocketed to the top of the trending charts, setting the internet ablaze.

Every sordid secret from Rodney's past surfaced in full detail, igniting a storm of public outrage that swept across the nation.

In sharp contrast, Hannah's fearless resolve and unwavering composure turned her into a symbol of resilience-earning her widespread admiration and sympathy from both the public and the media.

Consequently, the once-faltering shares of Luminara Group rebounded dramatically. The downward spiral halted and then reversed, soaring past critical resistance levels and climbing toward a record-breaking high.


  
  .
Before the glowing red trajectory displayed on the digital board, Hannah stood motionless, her face devoid of emotion. The steady rise reflected in her eyes, but her expression remained composed-cold,analytical, and absolute.

Without a word of celebration, she instructed her secretary to compile the updated market data and an assortment of positive media coverage and then deliver them to the desks of the senior executives who had been the loudest dissenters.

The secretary, calm and detached, relayed Hannah's message precisely. "Ms. Scott requests that everyone redirect their energy toward actual productivity rather than idle chatter and needless criticism. Luminara Group is not short of capable minds. If anyone feels unfit for their current role or unhappy within the company, you are free to tender your resignation. The door will not be barred behind you."

An uncomfortable silence followed. The executives'faces turned crimson with suppressed anger and
  
  .
humiliation, yet none dared speak. Their pride swallowed, they sat in stiff, uneasy quiet.

******

With the company's storm quelled for now, Hannah accepted the steaming cup of coffee her secretary offered.

She took a measured sip and then hesitated for a brief pause before reaching for her phone. She found Vincent's number and dialed it.

The line connected after a few rings. His deep,steady voice came through. "Hello?"

"It's me," she said softly, a faint tremor hidden in her composed tone. "I wanted to thank you for handling the Griffin Group situation for me."

A few seconds of silence lingered before Vincent replied, his voice cool and unreadable, "Did you cal just to say that?"

Hannah continued, her tone still polite but sincere, "I learned Rodney's being locked up went smoothly
  
  .
because of your intervention. Derek mentioned that without your pressure, his grandfather-the police chief-might've cleared him with a single word.I truly appreciate what you did."

Her gratitude sounded genuine, even gentle.

"Is that all?" Vincent asked, his tone flat, detached.

"Yes. I won't take more of your time." Before he could respond, she ended the call.

Inside the sleek glass-walled CEO office of the Jones Group, Vincent lowered his phone slowly. His gaze darkened, fruustration simmering just beneath the surface. She'd spoken to him as if nothing had ever happened-as if the night they had shared was just an illusion best forgotten. Fine by him!

Across the room, Vincent's private lawyer, Lennon,was organizing legal files per Vincent's earlier instructions.
The sudden trill of a phone broke the tension. Lennon glanced at the screen, his expression softening into a
  
  .
smile as he answered. "Hello, Ms. Scott."

The name hit Vincent like a strike. His eyes immediately shifted toward Lennon, sharp and dangerous.

Oblivious to the sudden shift in atmosphere, Lennon chuckled lightly. "Yes, Ms. Scott. Lunch today? I'm free...Perfect. I'll see you at noon."

When Lennon hung up, he looked up and froze.Vincent's glare could have turned the air to ice.Lennon blinked, uneasy. "Mr. Jones... Is there an issue with the documents?"

Vincent ignored the question entirely. His tone dropped several degrees colder. "Hannah called you?"

Lennon hesitated, caught off guard by his boss's cutting tone. "Yes. Ms. Scott just wanted to express her gratitude for our assistance on the Griffin case-and she invited me to lunch to discuss the follow-up work."

  
  .
Vincent's brow creased sharply. His jaw tightened,the faintest tremor of suppressed fury passing through him. The air in the office grew heavy,oppressive.

Lennon shifted uneasily under the weight of that silence, completely unsure what he had done wrong.

"You can leave now," Vincent said finally, voice like ice.

Relieved yet terrified, Lennon gathered his documents in haste and left without another word.

The instant the door shut behind Lennon, Vincent hurled his pen across the desk. It struck the far wall and fell, the sound sharp and final.

Irritation clawed at his chest. He couldn't believe Hannah could be so indifferent to him. Two days had passed since that night. Not a call from her. Not a message.Nothing.

And when she finally reached out, it was to talk business and thank him like she would a hired

  
consultant.

He clenched his jaw. To make it worse, she'd ended that very call, only to swiftly arrange lunch with his lawyer, of all people. A private lunch with his lawyer.What was she playing at? Did she treat him as if he were some disposable convenience? Did she think so little of him-that a mere lawyer deserved her time more than he did? Or worse-was she dissatisfied with his performance that night? Trying to see if another man could do better?

The thought burned through him, twisting his expression into something unreadable. He tugged at his tie, loosening it with a sharp jerk. His chest rose and fell, his breath uneven.

For the first time since the accident that stole his memories, Vincent had felt something raw and unfamiliar surging through him-a sharp,uncontrollable frustration, and it was born not from business or rivalry, but from Hannah.
###Chapter 632 Did | Say You Could Go
At that instant, Derek pushed open the office door,balancing an elegant lunch box in his hands. "Mr.Jones," he announced with a respectful smile, "I brought your meal. Would you like to have it now?"

Vincent, seated behind his desk, adjusted the cuffs of his tailored shirt with calm precision, his face unreadable. "I'll be eating out," he said flatly.

The words caught Derek off guard. He blinked,glancing uncertainly at the lunch box that suddenly seemed purposeless. "Then what should I do with this?"

"Give it to someone else," Vincent replied coolly,rising to his feet and heading for the door without another glance.

Startled, Derek hurriedly set the box down and rushed after him. "Yes, Mr. Jones! Should I take you to your usual restaurant?"
  
  .
"No need." Vincent's stride remained steady, but his voice carried a sharp undertone. After a brief pause,he added, "Find out where Lennon is having lunch."

Derek nearly stumbled mid-step. "Lennon?" he echoed, utterly baffled as to why a lawyer suddenly mattered in what seemed to be a simple meal decision. Still, he swallowed his questions and immediately reached for his phone.

Moments later, Derek received a reply and reported promptly, "Mr. Jones, Lennon is dining at the Gilded Restaurant."

Vincent's expression darkened, his eyes glinting like cold steel. "We're going to the Gilded Restaurant."

"Understood!" Derek answered swiftly, rushing to bring the car over.

The drive took only a short while, and soon, they pulled up before the grand entrance of the Gilded Restaurant.

Derek hurried inside to secure a private dining room.

  
  .
But when he turned around, Vincent wasn't behind him.

Instead, Vincent stood motionless in the lobby,scanning the restaurant's tables with a piercing gaze that cut through the crowd like a hawk tracking its prey.

"Mr. Jones," Derek called carefully as he jogged over,"the private room's ready. Are you... looking for someone? Lennon, perhaps?"

Vincent's eyes flicked away, his tone curt. "No."

Without further explanation, Vincent strode toward the reserved room, his steps sharp with unspoken irritation.

Sensing that something in his boss's mood was dangerously off, Derek hastily gestured for the waiter to serve the dishes, hoping the food might help smooth the tension radiating from Vincent's silence.

The plates arrived swiftly, steaming with rich aromas.

Yet, Vincent barely touched his cutlery. After a few
  
  
distracted pokes at his meal, he set it down, rose abruptly, and straightened his suit jacket.

"Mr. Jones, you're done already?" Derek ventured carefully, surprised.

"I've lost my appetite." Vincent's tone was clipped,his next words edged with frost. "Which dining room is Lennon in?"

Derek's stomach tightened. He immediately hurried to the front desk, returned moments later, and reported, "Mr. Jones, Lennon's on the second floor."

Without utering another word, Vincent turned and ascended the staircase, his expression stormy.

Derek trailed after him, practically half-running to keep up.

When they reached Lennon's private room, Vincent pushed the door open without knocking.

Inside, Hannah and Lennon looked up from their half-finished meal, startled by his sudden intrusion.
  
  .
"Vincent?" Hannah's brows knit together in surprise."What are you doing here?"

Vincent's gaze swept coldly over Lennon before settling on her. "I came to speak with my lawyer," he said, his voice distant, every syllable laced with tension. "Is that a problem?"

The edge in his tone caught Hannah off guard, but she quickly gathered herself, maintaining her composure. "I'm sorry if I've taken up Mr. Brooks'time," she replied smoothly. "It seems I've disrupted your business, Mr. Jones. I'll take my leave."

She started to rise, but Vincent's arm shot out,blocking her path with a firm, deliberate motion. "Did I say you could go?" His voice was low but commanding, his presence unmistakably forceful.

Hannah looked up at him, confusion flickering across her face. "Aren't you here to discuss work with Mr.Brooks? Wouldn't it be inappropriate for me to stay?"

For a brief moment, Vincent's composure faltered.He stared at her, saying nothing-his eyes carrying a
  
  .
weight that neither accusation nor reason could quite define.

Derek and Lennon exchanged uneasy glances. Both men recognized the unmistakable tension thickening the air but couldn't make sense of it.

Lennon silently mouthed to Derek. "What's going on?"

Derek could only grimace and mouth back. "How would I know?"

Sensing the brewing storm, Derek stepped forward quickly, tugging lightly at Lennon's sleeve and forcing an awkward smile toward Vincent. "Mr.Jones, we'll give you and Ms. Scott some privacy. We won't disturb you two any further."

Without waiting for a response, he ushered Lennon out of the room and gently closed the door behind them.

Out in the hallway, Lennon turned to Derek,bewildered. "What happened? Why did Mr. Jones
  
  .
barge in like that-and why did he look so furious?"

Derek exhaled deeply, rubbing the back of his neck."I was about to ask you! You could've told me you were having lunch with Ms. Scott."

Lennon frowned, genuinely puzzled. "She just invited me for a quick thank-you lunch and a follow-up discussion on the case. I didn't think I needed to report that to you."

The two men shared a resigned look, both sighing in unison.

Meanwhile, behind the closed door, silence hung heavy in the private room-just Vincent and Hannah,their unspoken emotions swirling like tension before a storm.
###Chapter 633 Bed Partners


Hannah and Vincent stood frozen in that charged silence, neither willing to yield, neither ready to break first. The air between them crackled with unspoken defiance.

At last, Hannah shattered the quiet. Her gaze lingered on the man before her-his expression carved from ice, his eyes sharp enough to wound."Did you come all the way here just to stand there,"she asked evenly, "or do you actually have something to say to me?"
Vincent offered no verbal reply. Instead, he drew a chair back with quiet deliberation and sat, one brow lifting in silent command for her to sit as well.
Hannah's wrist flicked slightly as she checked her watch, a faint line forming between her brows. "I have a crucial meeting at the office this afternoon."

"Oh?" The displeasure in Vincent's tone was
  
  .
unmistakable. "So urgent to leave already? Tell me,Hannah-do I make you that uncomfortable, or do you simply find no purpose in talking to me?"

Her eyes softened briefly in thought before locking onto his. A slow smile curved her lips. "Mr. Jones, are you keeping me here to discuss... our encounter the other night?"

His eyebrow twitched upward. He realized she was doing this deliberately-giving him the cold shoulder.His jaw tightened, that simmering fire in his chest flaring hotter. This woman was toying with him,teasing the boundaries of his restraint.

Forcing his tone into something controlled, Vincent said with deliberate calm, "Let me make one thing clear. I don't make a habit of walking away after spending the night with someone."

Hannah's eyes gleamed, the faintest spark of amusement flickering there. "Oh? Then what exactly are you trying to say, Mr. Jones? Are you here to..make amends?"

  
  .
Her words dripped with playful mischief.

He opened his mouth, but she raised a hand,cutting him off effortlessly. "Let's not dramatize it," she said lightly, her tone calm, detached, almost breezy."We're both adults. It was one night-two consenting people, each getting what they wanted. There's no reason to complicate something so simple. And that night, you did help me out of a tough situation."

Vincent's gaze deepened, his eyes dark as midnight.Her casual tone echoed in his memory-too familiar,too close to something he'd heard before-but the recollection slipped through his grasp before he could seize it.

"Each got what they wanted?" His voice suddenly hardened, sharp as glass. "Hannah, do you honestly think I'm the kind of man who needs to use a favor as currency to satisfy my needs?"

He leaned forward, eyes locked on hers. "That night had been the first time since I lost my memory.It wasn't meaningless to me."

  
  .
The words came out rough, strained-torn from somewhere deep inside him. For days, he'd been haunted by flashes of that night: her soft breathing,her trembling warmth, the way her touch seemed to echo even after she'd gone. And now, she stood before him pretending as if it had never happened.

Something flickered behind Hannah's calm exterior-a faint tremor, a hidden spark. "Then perhaps," she murmured, lips curving faintly, "I should compensate you for it?"

"Alright," Vincent said without hesitation, his voice low, eyesburning.

She faltered, taken aback for only a heartbeat, and then composed herself quickly. "Then tell me," she asked, voice dipping into something softer, more dangerous, "what does that make us now?"

"Bed partners." The words left his lips cold and clean, stripped of any emotion.
Something inside her recoiled at the bluntness of it.She rose slowly, crossing the narrow space between

 
them, every step measured, deliberate. Her gaze never wavered. "Bed partners?" she repeated quietly."Then why me, Vincent? You could have had anyone.Why insist on me?"

Since that night, she had intentionally kept her distance-not merely because of the chaos surrounding Rodney's scandal or the company's turmoil, but as a quiet experiment. She wanted to see whether his instincts-those faint threads of affection from before his memory loss-still reached for her without reason.

And his arrival today, no matter how abrupt, gave her the answer she wanted. He still cared. Back in their university years, Vincent had always held the reins.But not this time.

As she drew closer, her perfume enveloped him-subtle, intoxicating, unmistakably hers. His eyes fell to her lips, soft and moving slightly as shebreathed.
His throat tightened, and his Adam's apple bopped.Desire flared sharp and sudden. The impulse to pull her in and taste her again nearly overwhelmed him.
###Chapter 634 Kissing Her


A prick of impatience flared inside Vincent at the way Hannah probed him; impulse had always been his guide, and explaining himself had never been part of his habit. He seized her hand that jabbed at his chest, his eyes narrowing until they took on a hard edge. "You won't get explanations from me," he said,voice low and uncompromising.

For a moment, he admitted that her approach had achieved exactly what she intended. She had ensnared the full weight of his attention and the hunger that rode it.

Desire pushed ahead of restraint, and he closed the small distance between them with a sudden, decisive kiss. That kiss carried punishment and proclamation in equal measure-marked by possession and an urgent claim.

Hannah offered only a brief, half-hearted struggle

  
  .
that dissolved almost at once into yielding. She melted into the kiss and kissed him back.

Breaking the kiss, she breathed against his ear,breath quick and soft, "Vincent-you started it this time."

Her hands cupped his jaw, her gaze burning into him."Don't shut me out the way you did before."

She referred to their first time in the changing room at the university gym. She had made up her mind;whether Vincent's memory returned or not was beside the point. She intended, deliberately and patiently, to make him fall for her-piece by careful piece.

Vincent saw the brightness in her eyes and felt a stir in his chest; he was about to lean in for a deeper kiss when an untimely rap on the door fractured the moment.

A voice called from the corridor-Derek's, courteous and brisk. "Mr. Jones, you have visitors."
  
  .
Rodney's father, Fred, entered first, flanked by an elderly gentleman whose hair had gone silver at the temples. No guessing was necessary-the older man had to be Rodney's grandfather, the police chief,Arthur Griffin.

Hannah's chest tightened. They had come straight here with purpose spelled plainly on theirfaces:this would concern Rodney.

Vincent observed the two without the least flicker of surprise. He moved slowly, deliberately taking up the coffee pot and pouring himself another cup as if nothing urgent demanded his attention. After a measured sip, he lifted his eyelids and fixed his eyes on the visitors with a chill in his look. "What do you want?" he asked, curt and unwelcoming.

Fred supported the noticeably aged Arthur, his mouth curved into an almost ingratiating smile.

Arthur drew in a long breath. "Vincent, it's been a while, hasn't it?" he offered, though the courtesy felt thin.

  
  .
Vincent acted as if he hadn't heard, continuing to enjoy his coffee while giving them only the barest of looks.
Fred leaned in, voice hurried and urgent beneath the civility. "Dad, skip the niceties. Get to the point-if we waste time, the Griffin family could be finished!"

Though they kept their tones low, Hannah caught the phrase "Griffin family could be finished," and it sent a jolt through her. It became clear that Vincent's moves were faster and more far-reaching than she had imagined. The Griffin Group appeared to be on fragile ground; their options exhausted, they had come to beg or bargain.

Arthur's shoulders sank with a heavy exhale, the lines on his face seeming to deepen. Dropping any pretense, he cut to the chase. "Vincent, I'll be straightforward. My superiors suspended me pending an inquiry. Griffin Group stock has collapsed, and we face bankruptcy and liquidation.Several relatives in public office are under investigation and suspension-did you orchestrate
  
  .
this?"

Hannah's eyes widened in disbelief. Arthur had been suspended from his post... She hadn't anticipated that Vincent's campaign would spill into Arthur's official standing. His tactics wNere ruthlessly efficient.

Vincent set his cup on the table and raised his head,his stare icily fixed on Arthur. He answered without remorse,"Yes."

Arthur shook with fury and pointed an accusing finger. "Why? Our families have been intertwined for years, with countless deals between us. How could you be so merciless-driving the Griffin family to ruin?"

Vincent's expression did not soften; his voice was cold, distant, and cutting as he replied, "You crossed someone you should never have."
###Chapter 635 A Very Esteemed Guest
Vincent's words-the Griffin family crossed someone they should never have-pierced the air, and Hannah's pulse stuttered. Her eyes flicked instinctively toward Vincent, searching his expression for a hint of what he meant. Was he referring to her?

Arthur's face contorted with disbelief as his tone rose, frustration spilling through his words. "All this chaos-over a woman? Vincent, aren't you taking this too far? My foolish grandson made a mistake, yes,but he didn't even succeed! Haven't you punished us enough? Must the entire Griffin family be ruined over one woman?"

He was still clinging to his authority, attempting to downplay the incident and appeal to Vincent's reason-hoping the weight of his seniority might soften Vincent's fury.

But every word only added fuel to the fire.
  
  .
With a violent crash, Vincent flung his cup to the marble floor, shards scattering across the room. He rose to his full height, the temperature in the room plummeting beneath the oppressive force of his presence. His voice, low and glacial, rolled out like distant thunder. "If he had succeeded..." His gaze sliced through Arthur, every syllable edged with menace. "None of the Griffin family would still be breathing."

The statement detonated through the room like a thunderclap.

Even Vincent himself felt a flicker of surprise at the violence in his tone, his fingers curling unconsciously at his side. Hannah-she was the reason his emotions were spiraling beyond control.

Nearby, Derek felt his entire body stiffen, an icy tremor crawling up his spine.

No one in that room understood Vincent's retribution better than Derek did. He had witnessed firsthand how Vincent had driven the Griffin Group to the verge of collapse, unearthed Arthur's trail of
  
  .
corruption and embezzlement, and personally delivered the evidence to the disciplinary commission-an act that had led to Arthur's suspension. It was only a matter of time before prison walls replaced his office.

And the rest of the Griffin family members had not escaped Vincent's wrath. Those who had benefited from Arthur's influence were exposed one by one,stripped of their wealth, their jobs,their power-until the once-mighty Griffin family name became little more than ash in the wind.

Derek could only stare in awe. Amnesia or not,Vincent's instinct to shield the woman he cared for remained as ferocious as ever-perhaps even more merciless. For Hannah, he would tear the heavens apart.

Fred and Arthur stood ghost-pale, terror carved across their faces at the sheer ferocity of Vincent's ire.

Hannah,frozen beside Vincent, felt her chest tighten as his voice echoed in her ears. In that single
  
  .
moment, every doubt she had harbored-every anxious test, every confused speculation-was silenced. Even stripped of memory, even behind his cold indifference and distant words, Vincent was still the same man who would shield her in his domineering,absolute way.

Arthur's knees nearly buckled beneath him. He steadied himself on his cane, his son clutching his arm to keep him upright. His voice quavered with rage and disbelief. "Vincent... you're really going to destroy the Griffin family over a woman?"

Vincent offered no reply. Not even a glance. He simply reached for a fresh cup, liftedit to his lips,and drank as if nothing had happened. But his silence spoke louder than words-it was an admission.

Fred leaned close to Arthur, panic creeping into his voice. "Dad, he's serious. He won't back down. What do we do?"

A glint of ruthlessness and calculation flashed in Arthur's murky old eyes. He muttered, "Don't panic.I
  
  .
anticipated this brat might not cooperate, so I have a backup plan."

Before coming here, he had already found out Vincent's whereabouts and had quietly sent someone to fetch Sharon. Vincent might disregard him, but the young man would never dare dismiss his grandmother.

Arthur was confident that Sharon would intervene on his behalf for the sake of their long-standing friendship.

Vincent's patience, however, was wearing thin. A single cold glance toward Derek was all it took.

Understanding the silent command immediately,Derek stepped forward and said politely, "Mr. Jones has pressing business and can't entertain guests any longer.I'll have to ask you both to leave. Please..."

Arthur brushed Derek off with a dismissive wave, his chin lifting in challenge as he sank back into his seat."Why the rush to send us away, Mr. Jones? I've taken the liberty of inviting a very esteemed guest-one I'm
  
  .

certain you'll want to receive. Be patient for a few more minutes."

Vincent's brows drew together in irritation, his expression hardening with visible contempt. He had no intention of humoring them further. Rising to his feet, he gripped Hannah's wrist firmly. "I'm done here," he said coldly.

They were just turning to leave when a familiar voice drifted from the doorway.

Both Vincent and Hannah froze, their faces darkening.

"Well,well-what a lively gathering!" came the voice,warm yet commanding. "Arthur, I came as quickly as l could!"

It was Sharon.

At once, Arthur's relief was palpable. His entire face brightened with unrestrained joy as he rushed forward."Sharon! Finally! It's been ages since we last met."

 

Sharon smiled, her tone gentle but authoritative as she rested a hand on his arm. "Arthur, it really has been years. You've held up remarkably well."

Watching them, Vincent's and Hannah's expressions soured instantly. They hadn't imagined Arthur would stoop so low as to involve Sharon.

Derek, meanwhile, felt a shiver of grim satisfaction.Those two fools had just signed their own death warrants. Because if there was one thing Vincent despised above all else, it was having Sharon disturbed or used as leverage. And by doing exactly that, the Griffin family had just sealed their fate.
###Chapter 636 Accusations


Hannah's instincts kicked in at once, her face softening into a practiced warmth. With effortless grace, she approached Sharon and slipped her arm through Sharon's, her voice brimming with affection."Sharon! What a lovely surprise! I've missed you so much-it's been ages!"

Sharon's entire face brightened at the sight of Hannah.She drew Hannah into a cheerful embrace her tone both teasing and fond. "My dear Anna, I've missed you terribly! You've been back for so long,yet you never once thought to visit me!"

As Sharon laughed, her eyes wandered curiously around the room until they landed on Vincent,standing a short distance away. A satisfied gleam flashed in her gaze. The setting, the closeness-it all confirmed her happy suspicion that something more might be blossoming between Vincent and Hannah.

  
  .
Hannah responded in a sweet, apologetic tone, her smile perfectly measured, "Sharon, things have been quite chaotic at the company lately. But once everything settles, I swear I'll come to your place,and we'll talk for hours like before."

Sharon chuckled, tapping Hannah's nose affectionately. "You'd better mean that. I won't accept pretty words as payment this time."

The two women fell into lively chatter, their warmth drawing the spotlight entirely to themselves while Fred and Arthur stood awkwardly in the background,forgotten.

Unable to endure the exclusion any longer, Fred stepped forward, breaking the easy flow of conversation. "Mrs. Jones," he began nervously, "my father fetched you today because he has something urgent he needs your help with."

Sharon blinked, puzzled, and turned her attention back to Arthur. "Arthur, what's so urgent? You didn't mention any of this on the phone. I thought we were just having a friendly lunch to catch up."
  
  .

Sensing an opportunity, Hannah quickly guided Sharon to a seat beside Vincent, her movements graceful but deliberate-an elegant maneuver that neatly separated Sharon from the Griffins.

Arthur straightened his spine as Sharon settled into the chair, his confidence rekindled by her presence.His tone, however, carried a hard edge. "Sharon, you should ask your precious grandson what he's done.His behavior has gone far beyond disrespect-he's crossed every line imaginable! He's driving the Griffin family to ruin!"

The harshness in his voice only deepened Hannah's quiet revuulsion.

Sharon's brows knitted in confusion as she turned toward her grandson. "Vincent, what's going on here? Have you and Arthur had some sort of misunderstanding?"

Vincent's expression was carved from ice. He didn't even look in Arthur's direction. His words were calm but cold. "Grandma, it's nothing important-just some people stirring up trouble. The atmosphere
  
  .
here isn't good for you. I'll have Derek take you home."

He had no desire to let Sharon witness the ugliness of the situation-or the truth behind it.

At his quiet command, Derek stepped forward instantly. "Mrs. Jones, please follow me."

Derek knew well howN fiercely Vincent guarded Sharon's peace of mind. He'd even hidden the news of Erica's death to protect her frail health. What Arthur and his son had done today was nothing short of suicidal-they'd struck the one nerve Vincent would never allow anyone to touch.

When Fred saw Derek preparing to escort Sharon away, panic overtook him. His voice cracked as he pleaded, "Mrs. Jones, please don't leave! If you go now, the Griffin family is doomed! Dad, say something-explain everything to her!"

Sharon's face hardened at his desperation. She brushed aside Derek's assisting hand and demanded, "Enough! Someone had better start
  
  .
explaining.Vincent-talk to me!"

Arthur realized this was his last chance and immediately put on an aggrieved expression, his voice trembling with emotional weight. "Sharon,we've known each other for decades. I've always treated the Jones family generously. Whenever there's a good business opportunity, haven't I always thought of the Jones family first? But your grandson -he's turned on us completely. Not only does he forget old friendships, but he's also relentlessly pressing the Griffin family."

Tears welled in his eyes as he continued, his words spilling out in exaggerated emotions, "I've been suspended from my position without warning. Now,I'm under investigation. Griffin Group's shares are being bought out by hostile forces. Bankruptcy is right at our doorstep. Even our relatives working in government have been suspended for investigation and pushed aside. AIl of it-every bit of it-was orchestrated by Vincent. Tell me, Sharon, isn't that too cruel? How could he destroy us like this?"
###Chapter 637 Sharon Realized The Truth
Arthur dabbed at his eyes, voice breaking as he laid bare their predicament. "Sharon, truthfully, our household is floundering. We sold and pledged every asset within reach; still, the debts yawn like a chasm.If Vincent persists, we will be ruined. Today, I humbled myself and begged for mercy, but he remained stone-faced, utterly unmoved. I am at my limit, which is why I turned to you, Sharon. Please, for the sake of the friendship we've shared for decades,help the Griffin family. Give us a path back from this ruin."

Fred chimed in without delay, his voice thick with tears as he echoed the plea, "Mrs. Jones, please help us. Your grandson is being merciless. We're being driven to despair. Please intervene on our behalf."


  
  .
Vincent's forehead creased, a coId tension radiating from him.

Hannah listened as Fred's and Arthur's versions of events spilled out-twisted, selective, and nauseating to her core. Fred and Arthur had studiously avoided any mention of Rodney's crimes, painting themselves as victims and Vincent as the villain.

Unaware of the full story, Sharon's face hardened,and she turned to Vincent with a voice edged in rebuke. "Vincent, is what Arthur claimed true? Did you truly act this way? This is outrageous. Arthur has treated our family generously. Competing in business is one thing, but there are boundaries. The Jones family is far from destitute; why escalate to such extremes?"

Clearly, Sharon had been misled by Arthur and Fred,who fed her the notion that this was only ruthless commerce run amok.

Arthur and Fred exchanged a glance; hope flickered in their eyes like a small, relieved flame. They cared little for the particulars of Sharon's
  
=/Got a question? Ask it.
 misunderstanding, so long as she took their side and pressured Vincent.

Vincent watched his grandmother, angry from the deceptive description, his brow tightening further.Still, he refused to drag Rodney's vile behavior into the open-he would not force Hannah to relive those wounds nor burden Sharon with sordid details.In a low tone, he said, "Grandma, I know what I'm doing.This situation is too distressing for you; let Derek take you home to rest."

Sharon bristled. "How could I leave now? Arthur fetched me here to complain. Now that it has reached this point, I cannot simply walk away."

Seizing the opening, Arthur prostrated himself in gratitude. "Sharon, we owe you everything. In critical times, you're the one we can rely on! Your coming means more than words can say."
Watching Arthur's theatrical gratitude, Hannah felt a hot anger rise. She recognized Vincent's silence for what it was: protection for her, a refusal to expose her wounds. Yet, she could not stand by and watch
  
  .
Sharon be manipulated by the Griffins' lies.

Hannah stepped forward and, with a gentle firmness,took Sharon's hand. "Sharon, there's been a grievous misunderstanding. Vincent's conduct is not rooted in business dealings."

Sharon stared at Hannah, confusion and curiosity mixed on her features. "Not business? Then what explains it?"

Hannah met her eyes and said plainly, "It concerns me."

Vincent moved to stop Hannah. "You don't have to go into it."

But Hannah shook her head, the resolve in her look
unshakable. "I'm fine." She turned back to Sharon."You should witness the true nature of your old friends. We must not allow the innocent to suffer
while the guilty evade accountability."

Seeing the determination in Hannah's eyes, Vincent clamped his lips shut and, though pained, did not
  
  .
stop her again.

Sharon, bewildered by the sudden shift, pressed for clarity. "This involves Anna? Explain-what's happening? Be frank."

Hannah said slowly, choosing each word with care,"A few nights ago, I attended a business dinner. A client slipped something into my drink; I nearly-I was almost raped."

She paused for a beat and then continued, "The person who orchestrated it is Rodney-Arthur's grandson."

Shock rippled across Sharon's face as she gripped Hannah's hand tighter. She whirled her gaze toward Arthur and Fred; disbelief, disgust, and a trembling indignation warred across her countenance. Only then did the pieces fall into place-she now got why the normally composed Vincent had reacted so severely to the Griffin family. His actions had been retribution for what had happened to Hannah.

Arthur scrambled to defend himself, voice reeking of
  
  .
desperation. "It was my reckless grandson who erred -but he failed in his attempt, didn't he? Ms.Scott is unharmed! Rodney has already been punished; he faces life behind bars! And he was harmed by Ms.Scott and will never father children in the future! Isn't that sufficient as punishment?"

He tried to muddy the waters, shifting the focus."The remaining Griffins are blameless. What guilt do they bear? Why is the entire clan targeted? Vincent wants our entire lineage to pay the price. Sharon,do you think that's fair?"

Fred rushed to echo the piteous appeal. "Mrs. Jones,please reason with your grandson! We admit our wrongs; have mercy on us!"
###Chapter 638 Falling Out


Sharon absorbed Arthur's and Fred's unapologetic and even resentful excuses, breath coming in ragged pulls as emotion swelled beneath her ribs. Slowly,with deliberate care, she rose from her seat.

Hannah, alarmed by the change in Sharon's countenance, stepped forward without hesitation and moved to steady her.

Sharon crossed the small space to Arthur, fixing him with a look that cut through pretense-eyes heavy with disappointment. Her voice, tight and edged,broke the quiet. "Arthur, I feel profoundly let down.What you said just now sits very wrong with me."

Arthur, shrinking beneath that stern regard, fumbled for a defense even as the shame in his chest tried to surface. "What exactly is so wrong? Rodney didn't make it-nothing terrible happened to that woman,"he protested and pointed at Hannah.

  
  .
"Enough!" Sharon snapped, fury igniting at his cold reasoning. She lifted her cane and struck out at Arthur, the motion quick and fierce. "Your refusal to acknowledge your grandson's error is unforgivable."

Despite the weight of years, Arthur moved with surprising nimbleness and dodged the cane by instinct, his body betraying a reflex that belied his age. Outraged, he barked, "Sharon, why would you strike me?"

"I'm attacking you because you've proved yourself stubborn and unable to tell right from wrong, and you've failed utterly in teaching your grandson better," Sharon answered, her words trembling with rage as she readied herself for another strike.

Vincent watched from the edge of the room with a chill composure. Seeing his grandmother rise to Hannah's defense so vehemently stirred in him a blend of astonishment and dawning clarity.

It became clear why, before memory had deserted him, he had chosen to marry Hannah-in his grandmother's estimation, she was exactly the kind
  
  .
of partner she approved of.

Hannah, seeing Sharon on the verge of losing control, moved in swiftly and took Sharon's hand with a gentle but firm hold. "Sharon, chill out," she urged softly. "He's not worth putting yourself at risk."

But Sharon's ire lingered like a hot brand. "Anna don't stop me now! I must release this anger foryou today," she insisted.

Hannah tightened her grip on Sharon's hand."Vincent has already stood up for me-he did it properly. You don't have to soil your hands for my sake."

At Hannah's reassurance, Sharon's grip on the cane slackened. Her arm dropped slowly, the weapon lowering as her tempest cooled just a measure. She turned then and pressed a gentle hand to Hannah's cheek, affection and worry mingling on her face."Anna, you have endured so much; it pains me to see you suffer."

Arthur watched the exchange unraveling before him,
and somethinginside him-a bitterness long kept under wraps-surged forward. The collapse of his family's fortunes, the sense of being cornered by ruin, and resentments old and new swelled until restraint snapped. The harshness he had buried rose up unfiltered.

With Sharon's back turned and Hannah standing between them, Arthur-driven by a desperate,vindictive impulse-let malice loose. He raised his walking stick high and brought it down with a violent arc toward Sharon's unguarded back. "Sharon, you refused to help me and even struck me. I'm not going to take this lying down!" he cried, voice thick with fury.

"Sharon, watch out!" Hannah screamed, moving on instinct to throw herself between them and extend an arm to shield Sharon.

There was a dull, sickening thud as Arthur's stick connected with Hannah's arm.

A sharp gasp escaped Hannah; pain flared and quickly bloomed into a dark bruise beneath the skin. Everything collapsed into a thicket of action and noise.

Vincent, whose thoughts had been steadily circling his grandmother's fierce defense toward Hannah,was jolted into the present by the abrupt assault. He surged forward, hauling Hannah behind him like a shield. His eyes fell on the angry welt on her arm, and an unfamiliar, terrible rage flooded him.

Sharon reacted, panic and sorrow knitting together in her chest. Seeing Hannah struck while protecting her, she felt her heart clench with a tenderness laced with fear. She reached out to support Hannah. "Anna!Are you hurt? Are you in pain?" she asked,voice breaking.

Hannah, trying to steady herself andfight through the shock, forced a pale, stubborn shake of the head."Sharon, I'm fine."

Vincent's brow knitted into a hard line; his posture shifted into something imposing. How could she claim to be fine when her injury was this severe?Vincent turned to Derek with a sharp command."Derek, call the police! Arthur committed assault."

Derek snapped to attention and replied without delay, "Yes, Mr. Jones!"

Derek pulled his phone free and began dialing the authorities.

Arthur, driven past reason, laughed, a jagged,hysterical sound. "Call them if you must! Ha! What else do the Griffin family have to lose? Your grandmother struck me first! If anyone is to be punished, we'll all go down together. Do your worst!"
###Chapter 639 Does That Worry You


The sound of hurried footsteps echoed through the corridor before uniformed officers burst into the private room.

Without a moment's delay, the officers advanced straight toward Arthur and Fred, their movements firm and authoritative.

At the forefront, the leading officer produced his badge and a crisp warrant, his tone sharp and unwavering. "Arthur Griffin. Fred Griffin. You are hereby taken into custody under suspicion of multiple offenses, including affray and corruption.The evidence against you is substantial. You are required to come with us for further questioning."

The color drained from Arthur's and Fred's faces in an instant.

Fred, visibly shaken, jabbed an accusing finger toward Vincent and Hannah, his voice cracking with outrage as he questioned the leading officer, "Why are you only arresting us? What about them? They threw punches too! If you're making arrests, then arrest everyone involved!"

The leading officer's eyes turned glacial. "We follow procedure, not temper. The verified evidence implicates you two directly. Any other matters will be reviewed and determined through proper investigation. Now, please cooperate."

With a curt signal from the leading officer, two officers stepped forward, their cuffs clicking open with metallic finality as they prepared to restrain Arthur and Fred.

Arthur's composure shattered under the weight of humiliation and shock. His complexion shifted from flushed crimson to ashen white, his breathing shallow and erratic. He parted his lips, desperate to speak, but his throat failed him. His pupils rolled upward, and in the next second, his body crumpled heavily to the floor.

"Dad? Dad!" Fred's voice trembled as he dropped beside Arthur, panic flooding his expression."Somebody call an ambulance! My dad has high blood pressure-heart problems too! If anything happens to him, it's on you!"

The room erupted into confusion. The officers exchanged tense glances, frowns creasing their brows. A medical emergency in the midst of an arrest would complicate everything.

As uncertainty clouded the officers' decision, Sharon -who had been watching in composed silence-let out a weary sigh. She stepped forward, retrieved a small pillbox from her handbag, and handed it to the leading officer. Her voice was steady and clear. "This is a fast-acting antihypertensive. His collapse was likely triggered by a surge in blood pressure caused by emotional strain. Slip this under his tongue-it should stabilize him for now."

The leading officer assessed her calm explanation and then nodded to a subordinate to follow her direction.

Fred, however, refused the pill. His voice broke with desperation. "Medicine alone won't save him-we need to visit the hospital for a full check-up! You can't gamble with his life!"

All eyes were fixed on Arthur's unmoving body.

Hannah narrowed her eyes slightly. She caught a subtle motion-Arthur's fingers twitching faintly at his side. And more importantly, his eyelids fluttered,and his lashes trembled. Those weren't the signs of a man unconscious-they were tells of a man pretending.

A faint smirk curved her lips. This cunning old fox was trying to buy time by pretending to faint.

Without a word, she reached for the nearest cup of coffee with her uninjured left hand and flung its cold contents directly at Arthur's face.

Arthur flinched violently, letting out a startled,unmistakably conscious "Ah!" Instinctively,he raised his hand to wipe his drenched face, his eyes snapping open with fury at being exposed. Hannah regarded him coolly, her tone even as she turned to address the leading officer, "As you can see, he seems perfectly fine. You may proceed with your duties."

Annoyance flickered across the leading officer's face once he realized Arthur's ploy. His voice hardened."Enough of this farce. Take them away."

Two officers seized the still-pretending Arthur,forcing him to his feet and securing the cuffs with practiced precision.

Both Arthur and Fred stood defeated, all defiance drained from their expressions. As they were escorted past Hannah, Arthur shot her a venomous glare."Hannah, I truly misjudged you."

Her lips curved faintly in reply, though her eyes remained cold.

Once the policemen led the pair out, silence fell over the room like settling dust.

Vincent's gaze drifted to Hannah's wounded arm. A faint crease formed between his brows as he spoke in a low, uncertain tone. "You're awfully composed for someone hurt that badly. Doesn't it sting? And yet, you still found time to expose that old man's feigned faint."

He meant it as disbelief, but there was something uncertain-almost concerned-beneath his words.

Hannah, who had been watching the doorway,turned her head slowly. Realizing his remark was directed at her, she let her brows knit delicately, extending her injured arm with quiet poise. Her voice softened,touched with playfulness. "I didn't feel it earlier-l was too busy dealing with those fools. But now..."She paused, feigning a wince. "Now, it does hurt."

Her eyes met his, searching, almost teasing."Mr.Jones,does that worry you?"

Vincent's chest tightened at the sight of her outstretched arm, but his response came rough and sharp, as if to mask something unspoken. "If it hurts,that's your own fault. You could've avoided it, but you insisted on blocking with your arm. You brought that pain on yourself."

Even as he scolded, the image of her shielding his grandmother replayed in his mind-and with it came a surge of vexing emotion he couldn't quite name.
###Chapter 640 Just One Kiss And It Won't Hurt Anymore
Sharon quietly observed the subtle exchanges between Vincent and Hannah. Though Vincent's words carried a sting, his eyes told another story-one of genuine concern. A faint, knowing smile curved her lips. Even with his memories lost, it seemed his care for Hannah was carved deep into his bones, something no amnesia could erase.

Taking advantage of the moment, Hannah turned toward Sharon with a playful complaint, her tone touched with a soft, endearing whine. "Sharon, look at Vincent! I'm hurt, and he still talks to me like that."
Sharon chuckled, giving Hannah's uninjured hand a gentle pat. "All right, all right, Anna. You know how Vincent is-his words might be sharp, but his heart's probably bleeding for you. Give him some grace."

Sharon rubbed her temples, the fatigue of the long  day catching up with her. "Oh dear, this whole ordeal has truly worn me out. Vincent, I'll leave Anna to you.Make sure she gets to the hospital and has her bruises properly treated. I'll head home for some rest."

Vincent didn't argue this time. His tone was steady."Okay." He turned to Derek and instructed, "Derek,please take my grandma home and make sure she rests."
"Yes, Mr. Jones! Mrs. Jones, this way, please," Derek replied promptly, supporting Sharon as they exited.

And then, just Vincent and Hannah remained.

Without wasting a moment, Vincent escorted Hannah to the hospital.

The drive was swift.

Soon, the doctor began tending to the bruises on her arm.

When the ointment touched her swollen skin, a sharp, needle-like pain shot through her. Her brows  knit together, tiny beads of sweat dotting her forehead.

Almost on instinct, she reached out and clutched Vincent's wrist.

The warmth of her touch startled him. A strange sensation rippled through his chest. He should have pulled away-but didn't. He couldn'tsay why.

When the doctor pressed harder and Hannah let out a small cry of pain, Vincent's expression dárkened.His voice turned cold as frost as he said to the doctor, "Couldn't you be gentler?"

Startled by the sudden tension, the doctor quickly softened his touch and explained nervously, "Mr.Jones, the bruising here needs to be dispersed so the blood can circulate properly. Some pain during the process is... inevitable."

Vincent's frown deepened further.
Trying to catch her breath, Hannah forced a weak smile at the doctor. "It's all right. Do what you need to.I can handle it,"

She didn't want to appear too delicate.

By the time the treatment ended, her strength was spent. She slumped back in the chair, forehead slick with cold sweat.

Soon after, she was admitted into a VIP room-spacious, quiet, and almost as refined as a hotel suite.

Looking around, Hannah managed a faint laugh."Vincent, it's just a minor injury on my arm. Did you really need to get me a private room? Isn't this too much?"

Vincent met her gaze, his voice firmn but calm. "At a time like this, you still have the mind to worry about that?"

Hannah sighed softly, trying to lighten the air. "It's because it hurts so much that I have to distract myself somehow."
 
Vincent studied her face-her stubborn attempt to appear fine-and remained silent for a long moment before asking suddenly, "Are you afraid of pain?"

The question caught her off guard. Her eyes lit up with a flicker of hope. "Wait... Did you remember something?"

Vincent shook his head. "The doctor mentioned it earlier." Earlier, when he collected her prescription,the doctor had explained that Hannah might have a heightened sensitivity to pain-that her body reacted more strongly than most-and he should keep that in mind.

So, he hadn't reclaimed any memories after all.Swallowing her disappointment, Hannah managed a playful smile. "Yeah, and it's unbearable."

Vincent's eyes lingered on her face, his Adam's apple moving slightly. Then, in an awkward tone, he suggested, "Try closing your eyes for some rest.Once you're asleep, you won't feel the pain."
"I can't sleep," Hannah murmured, shaking her head.Then, as if a thought struck her, she turned toward  him, her eyes glimmering with mischief. "But... I do know another way to ease the pain."

"What way?" he asked without thinking.

Hannah leaned in a little closer, her tone soft and teasing. "How about a kiss?" Her lips curved into a playful smile. "Just one kiss, and it won't hurt anymore."

Vincent froze. Was she being serious-or just trying to charm him? In an instant, his ears turned crimson.Like someone scorched by sudden heat, he turned his face away, his voice slightly fluistered. "Don't be ridiculous."

A voice inside him warned him not to be swayed or lose his composure. This wasn't like him.

Seeing his reaction, Hannah quickly dropped her teasing act and pretended to be nonchalant. With her uninjured hand, she reached for her phone on the bedside table. "If you won't, that's fine. I'll find someone else to comfort me. After all, there are plenty of fish in the sea."

###Chapter 641| Forbid It


Hannah had scarcely finished her sentence when Vincent's face darkened so swiftly that it was as though thunderclouds had gathered behind his eyes.Without a word, he shot to his feet, seized her phone from her grasp, and spoke in a voice trembling with reined-in anger. "I forbid it."

The sudden vehemence of his action stunned Hannah, but she quickly steadied herself, arching an eyebrow as her gaze met his.

Vincent's stare locked onto her with an intensity that stripped the air of calm; his Adam's apple bobbed once in a sharp swallow. An unbidden surge of emotion swept through him, scattering every thread of restraint. He bent down, one hand braced against the bed beside her, the other lifting her chin with a firm gentleness, and before he could think better of it, his lips descended toward hers. Just as the space between them vanished, a sharp knock fractured the moment.

A nurse entered briskly, pushing a cart laden with medical instruments.

Hannah instinctively leaned back, a quiet laugh escaping her lips like a flicker of mischief.

Vincent's expression tightened in visible irritation,but he straightened himself, masking the turmoil beneath a rigid calm, and returned to his seát on the sofa.

Hannah turned toward the nurse, faint confusion stirring within her. Her wound had already been dressed-what else was there to do?

The nurse grumbled with open disapproval as she arranged the tools, "Kissing, really? Can't you see she's injured? What kind of husband behaves like that?" Her eyes flicked accusingly to Vincent, her meaning unmistakable.

Vincent's brows drew together, his gaze glacial, but he said nothing. He was not the kind of man who wasted breath on strangers.

Hannah found the nurse's indignation baffling-they had never met before. Politeness compelled her to clarify, "I think there's been a misunderstanding. I'm not his wife."

To Hannah's astonishment, the nurse's outrage only flared brighter. She straightened, voice rising with moral fervor. "Not his wife? You mean he refuses even to acknowledge your relationship? And you still stay by his side? A man like that doesn't deserve such loyalty!"

As the nurse spoke, her hands moved swiftly,tightening a tourniquet, wiping the crook of Hannah's arm with alcohol, and readying a needle.

Both Vincent and Hannah froze, exchanging bewildered glances.
Hannah, utterly perplexed, stared at the nurse and asked cautiously, "Excuse me, why are you drawing my blood? The doctor said nothing about any blood test when he treated me earlier."

The nurse stopped, confused, and looked at Hannah."Wait, you're not donating blood? Didn't this gentleman ask you to give some to his mistress? My colleague told me a man in VIP Room 1 requested his wife to donate blood for his mistress, since only his wife's blood type matched hers."

Hearing this, Hannah's eyebrows lifted in playfulness as she glanced at Vincent. "Oh? Another affair partner, Vincent? And now you need my blood to save her life?"

Vincent's eyes darkened to an iron hue. He turned toward the nurse, his tone freezing the air. "Are you sure you're not mistaken?"

The nurse faltered, shrinking a little under his severe presence, yet tried to hold her ground. "Mistaken? l-I don't think so. Isn't this VIP Room 1? I was specifically told to come here and draw the blood."

In truth, the nurse was new to the job, too easily swayed by gossip and indignant on behalf of the wronged wife, and her attempt at justice had clearly gone astray. Judging from the startled looks on their faces, she realized neither of them fit the story she had heard.

Sighing inwardly, Hannah decided to set things straight. "You've definitely come to the wrong room,"she said gently. "I only had a few bruises treated,nothing that requires a blood test-and certainly no affair partner waiting to be rescued. The people you're looking for must be next door."

The nurse froze in embarrassment, unsure what to say, when her phone began to ring. She hurriedly answered, listened, and her expression twisted in mortification. "What? Room 2? Holy shit! I'll be right there!"

Ending the call, the nurse flushed crimson, bowing repeatedly. "I'm terribly sorry! I really mixed it up. It's the husband next door-he's the one trying to make his wife donate blood for his mistress. Unwilling to donate blood, his wife ran away and locked herself in the VIP Room 2. I'll leave now. My sinc erest apologies for disturbing you both!"

In a fluster of movement, the nurse gathered her tools, nearly sprinted out, and gently pulled the door shut behind her.

Silence descended on the room once more, thicker than before, charged with awkward tension.

After a long pause, Vincent spoke, his tone low and edged with disbelief. "Did you just say I have another affair partner?" He caught onto the word liké a snare tightening. "'Another'-meaning what exactly? You're implying there was one before?"

Hannah blinked slowly, her voice intentionally vague and teasing. "Well,you could put it that way."

Her evasive answer only fueled his irritation. His gaze fixed on her, sharp and searching. "Explain. What do you mean, 'could put it that way'?"
Since the accident had stripped him of his memories,every fragment of his past was a shadow he couldn't reach. Anything hinting at betrayal-or pain he might have caused Hannah-stirred a deep, instinctive unease in him. He could endure many things, but not the possibility that the man he used to be had once wounded the woman sitting before him.
###Chapter 642 You Might Not Fully Understand Me
  Hannah met Vincent's gaze-those eyes brimming with persistent curiosity-and a fleeting thought crossed her mind. Ever since his memory loss, he seemed to have changed. The man who once kept his emotions locked behind a steel door now spoke his thoughts freely, as if the key to his heart had finally turned. When he had questions, he simply asked. Could that be the silver lining of his amnesia?Or perhaps it was just the inevitable result of his blank slate-he couldn't rely on memory, so he had no choice but to seek answers.

She sighed softly, a sound as light as mist. "You used to have a sisterly figure-Brinley. You treated her SO well that I once thought she was the woman you truly loved."Vincent's brows knit together as he caught the thread of her meaning. "So, Brinley was the reason we divorced?" He remembered Brinley-out of gratitude to her father, he had regarded her as a sister, nothing more.

Hannah shook her head, her expression tinged with bitter memories. "She was only part of the reason.The real issue was the lack of communication between us. You rarely shared what weighed on your mind, and over time, silence turned small misunderstandings into walls neither of us could climb."

She left it there, unwilling to reopen the wounds buried beneath those memories.
Vincent listened, frowning slightly. To him, such a reason seemed too fragile to tear a marriage apart.

He leaned closer, resting his hands on either side of the bed, his presence both steady and intense. His eyes searched hers as his voice deepened, carrying an uncommon sincerity. "Hannah," he said slowly,"I think you might not fully understand me. When I decide to marry a woman, it means I've given her  everything-heart, loyalty, and life. I don't share my devotion. Once I commit, I stand by it. Betrayal is simply not in my nature."

The firmness in his tone left no room for doubt.

Hannah watched him quietly. His words fell like solemn vows, stirring the tide of memories from the early days of their marriage-days painted in tenderness and quiet devotion. Yes, the promises he had once made sounded just like that.
She lowered her gaze, her lashes trembling. Her voice, soft yet cutting through the still air, broke the moment's calm. "But Vincent, we still got divorced."

Her simple words struck deeper than anyaccusation.He didn't move, still leaning forward, his silence filling the space between them.

After a long pause, he spoke again, his tone even,almost too rational. "I don't remember what happened after we married, so I can't speak for the past. But logically, if a marriage ends in divorce, it must mean some conflicts couldn't be resolved When two people reach that point, it's because something essential has broken beyond repair."

It was a cold, measured conclusion-precise,reasonable, and painfully in line with his nature.

Hannah lifted her gaze to him. If she had heard such words right after their divorce, they might have stung, but part of her would have agreed. Now,however, time had softened her bitterness. She no longer sought to weigh their love by logic or compare their hearts on scales of compatibility.

She heard his loyalty, yes-but beneath it, she also sensed his detachment. It wasn't what she wanted to hear.His rationality, like frost on glass, made all their suffering-every argument, every tear, every hard-won reconciliation-sound like a mere statistic.

The air between them thickened, heavy with unspoken thoughts.

Without their noticing, the warmth that had flickered earlier-the intimacy born of almost-kissed lips-quietly faded away.
###Chapter 643 Won't Your Fiancée Mind

A sudden wave of fatigue swept through Hannah,draining what little strength she had left. She tugged the blanket up to her shoulders, turned away, and murmured, "I need to rest. Please leave."

At her dismissal, Vincent's brows knitted together,his chest tightening as he stood still beside her bed.He could clearly sense her mood had taken a downturn. Was she upset? But why? What had he said that provoked this cold dismissal?

In his mind, his earlier words about loyalty in marriage and the inevitability of a divorce had been reasoned and honest, statements born from logic and principle, not emotion. They should have been beyond offense. Yet, her silence made him question everything.

As she lay turned away, cocooned beneath the blanket, her posture spoke volumes-shut off,unreachable, unwilling to continue the conversation.

Vincent lingered there, uncertain. Emotional subtleties had never been his strength, especially when it came to the woman who had once stirred the deepest corners of his heart. After a long pause, he said nothing. His eyes lingered on the faint outline of her back-fragile, quiet, yet filled with restrained emotion. Then, wordlessly, he turned and walked out.

The sharp click of the door latch echoed in the quiet ward, and the sound pierced Hannah's heart like a fine needle. He had really left-just like that. No question. No comfort. No attempt to stay.

Her chest felt as though it were being slowly twisted by invisible hands. The irritation wouldn't leave; it only grew tighter and more suffocating. She curled up under the blanket, a small, trembling shape swallowed by frustration.

She and Vincent were always like this-moving on different frequencies, missing each other at every turn. When she had finally stopped hoping and chosen to let him go, he had fought his way back into her life, desperate, relentless, almost mad with determination.

And now, when she had lowered her guard and started loving him again, fate had stripped him of his memories-their pain,their love, their reconciliation-all vanished, leaving behind the cold, indifferent man she had once known.

The dissonance between them felt endless, like two clocks that could never tick in time. Exhaustion settled deep into her bones, heavy and unshakable.


******

Several days passed before the official court summons arrived-Fred had filed a lawsuit, accusing Hannah of intentional assault.

On the morning of the hearing, Hannah walked into the courtroom with Lennon, her composure unbroken.

Her gaze instinctively swept the gallery, searching for a familiar figure. But Vincent was nowhere to be seen. Only Sharon sat among the attendees. He hadn't come...

A brief sting of disappointment flickered through her chest, but she quickly forced it down. This was not the moment for emotion. She straightened her back,her focus narrowing to the trial ahead.

Throughout the proceedings, Hannah remained calm and incisive. She presented the restaurant's surveillance footage and the records of Rodney's previous assaults on other women, proving beyond doubt that he had initiated the attack-and that her actions had been pure self-defense.

Lennon measuredly dismantled Fred's claims and rendered them collapsed under evidence and logic until the case was stripped bare.

The final verdict was decisive-Hannah's actions were ruled as legitimate self-defense. She bore no criminal responsibility.

Meanwhile, Rodney was sentenced to ten years in  prison for a string of offenses, including rape.

The victory was absolute.

When Hannah stepped out of the courthouse,the sunlight hit her face with blinding intensity. She shook Lennon's hand, expressing her gratitude for his flawless defense.

As she turned to leave, a flicker of movement caught her eye. Claude stood at the base of the courthouse steps, clutching a large bouquet of yellow róses. His gaze clung to her like a shadow.

Hannah's expression hardened. She instinctively veered to the side, intending to avoid Claude entirely,but he stepped forward swiftly, blocking her path.

"Anna," Claude greeted, forcing a strained smile,"congratulations.You won."

She halted, her eyes cold, her voice edged with disdain. "Claude, what exactly are you congratulating me for? A case of narrowly escaping a rape attempt?This isn't a victory-it's the bare minimum of what justice should deliver. If even this had failed, then there would truly be something broken in this country."

Claude's smile faltered, awkward and brittle. "That's not what I meant... I'm just happy for you-"

"Claude," she cut in sharply, her tone distant and unyielding, "I told you before-I don't want further contact with you. If your fiancée learns you came here for me, won't she mind?"

The mention of Bonnie made his eyes flicker, unease rippling through his composed mask. Only last night,after too much wine and too much family pressure,he had given in-slept with Bonnie to satisfy the Hobbes family's demand that he continue the bloodline.

The act had left him hollow, as though he had betrayed Hannah herself. And so, earlier this morning, driven by restless unease and longing,he had discreetly sought out Hannah's schedule-only to uncover the string of ordeals she had recently endured. "My engagement with her was never about love," he murmured, his voice low and raw. "It was just a business alliance. Even if she finds out, it won't matter." He was completely unconcerned about Bonnie's feelings.

He looked at Hannah, his composure crumbling into something close to pleading. "Anna, please. I just want to talk to you for a while. Everything has been chaos lately-I don't know what to do."

He reached out, instinctvely trying to take her hand.

Hannah recoiled, her eyes narrowing. As his sleeve slipped back, faint red welts crossed his wrist-marks of a whip. Her tone sharpened. "Your parents did this?"

She knew the Hobbes family's discipline was as severe as it was archaic.

Claude lowered his gaze, his face vulnerable."Yes...They've been furious with me. Nothing I do is ever right."
###Chapter 644 Starting To Care


When Hannah's eyes landed on the red, raw gashes marring Claude's wrist, a ripple of tenderness stirred within her chest-an echo from the days of scraped knees and laughter under sunlit trees. No matter how much she wanted to stay detached, that flicker of shared childhood made it impossible to walk away.

With a resigned sigh, she murmured, "I can spare ten minutes at most."

The gloom in Claude's face lifted instantly; joy flared in his eyes like the spark of a long-extinguished flame. "Ten minutes is plenty. There's a quiet caféjust down the street."

"Lead the way," she replied, her voice cool and measured.

They moved together down the narrow path toward the corner, their footsteps falling out of rhythm-Claude walking ahead with occasional backward glances, and Hannah keeping a careful distance to trail behind.

Across the road, beneath the wide shadow of an ancient tree, a sleek black Maybach stood parked in silence.

Inside, Vincent sat stone-still, the storm brewing behind his composed expression. His dark eyes were locked on Hannah's and Claude's departing figures until they vanished around the bend, leaving only a heavy stillness behind.

The air inside the car was thick enough to choke on.
Derek, watching the reflection of Vincent's face through the rearview mirror, hesitated before speaking. "Mr. Jones, should we follow them?"

Vincent's jaw tightened, the muscles flexing beneath his skin. His lips pressed into a hard line before he answered, voice clipped, "Back to the office."
"Yes, Mr. Jones." Derek didn't dare question Vincent.He started the engine, though his thoughts ran loose and mutinous. Vincent had abandoned a mountain of work to rush here, only to run into this... Ah, the situation between Vincent and Hannah was a tangled mess.

In Derek's mind, the solution was simple: if Vincent truly cared, he should have stepped out of the car,taken Hannah's hand, and asserted his dominance outright. But now-after the memory loss-Vincent's once-clear emotions were reduced to confusion and hesitation. The decisive man he'd been was gone,replaced by someone uncertain, fighting feelings he couldn't name.

As the Maybach pulled away from the courthouse,the traffic light ahead flicked to red, forcing the car to a stop. Derek's sharp eyes caught a familiar face on the curb-Lennon, hand raised, trying to hail a cab.

"Mr. Jones, Lennon is over there," Derek announced.Vincent's gaze shifted slightly, his voice low. "Pick him up."

"Understood." Derek eased the car to the side and rolled down the window to call out to Lennon.

Lennon blinked, surprised to see the luxury car. Still,he opened the door and slipped into the passenger seat. "Mr. Jones? What brings you here?"

Vincent ignored the question. "Did the case conclude smoothly?"

Lennon nodded. "Perfectly. The evidence was solid.Rodney received ten years for attempted rape and related offenses."

Vincent gave a curt nod. "Good."

Silence lingered-thick, uncomfortable.

Then, as though in passing, Vincent asked, "Did she...mention me?"

The question caught Lennon off guard. He instantly knew "she" meant Hannah. After a pause, he answered honestly, "No. Ms. Scott was focused on the case, completely immersed in the proceedings.
She didn't bring up anything personal." The moment the words left Lennon's mouth, Derek felt the temperature in the car drop several degrees.He was itchy to clamp a hand over Lennon's mouth.Lennon, the top attorney who could charm entire juries with his words, had unwittingly maddened Vincent by revealing the truth.

Vincent's face hardened, his eyes glinting with restrained emotion. He didn't reply-just turned toward the window, the city's reflections washing over his cold, chiseled profile.

Derek grumbled in his heart that Vincent's anger wasn't about the case or the day's events. It might be because he started to care for Hannah.

Sensing the sudden tension but confused by its trigger, Lennon shifted uneasily, fingers brushing his nose. He replayed his words in his head, trying to pinpoint which one had struck the wrong chord-but none seemed offensive. Inside the café, sunlight filtered through the tall windows, glinting off polished marble tables. Hannah sat stiffly across from Claude, ignoring the glass of juice he pushed toward her. Her tone was crisp,impatient. "Say what you came to say."

Claude's eyes lingered on her face-the same face that once smiled freely at him. A dull ache throbbed in his chest, but his voice remained calm. "Bonnie and I are getting married soon."

Her expression didn't shift an inch. The words washed over her like wind against stone. "Oh.Congratulations."

That hollow "congratulations" pierced deeper than any accusation. For a moment, Claude forgot how to breathe. She truly didn't care at all. He forced a crooked smile and rolled up his sleeves,revealing the raw, inflamed stripes along his arm. "Thank you. It's just... things at home have been rough lately."
Her brows drew together. The marks on his forearm looked brutal. "Your parents did that to you?" she asked, her tone softening just slightly despite herself. For all her irritation toward his persistence, her instinct to care refused to die.

Claude lowered his gaze. "They said it's part of the Hobbes family's... tradition. To inherit the family business, one must learn endurance-learn to give up what others cannot."

He let the lie slip easily between them, careful to keep his eyes downcast. The truth was far less noble.Those lashes were self-inflicted-his own desperate attempt to garner her sympathy. He knew her heart better than anyone. Hannah could turn away from love. But from pain-especially someone else's-she never could.
###Chapter 645 I'm Getting Married Soon
Hannah found the family tradition Claude had mentioned absurd. "Come on, Claude. You're old enough to know how to stand up for yourself. Family businesses matter, yes-but not at the cost of being treated like this."

"Are you worried about me?" A flicker of hope danced in Claude's eyes. She had fallen for it, just as he expected-her compassion had taken over.

"No," Hannah replied crisply, her tone cooling in an instant. "I'm just speaking from a place of common decency, nothing more."

The spark in Claude's eyes dimmed. He inhaled deeply, his voice tinged with what seemed to be contrition. "Anna, I know I frightened you before.I went too far and lost control. But I am really going to settle down and take up my responsibilities. I swear, from this day on, I'll never cross that line again. I'll treat you only as a little sister."

His words carried a quiet desperation. "Could we just go back to being what we were-ordinary siblings?You know my biological parents never cared for me.Only you and your mother treated me like family. The thought of losing you completely is unbearable. That would be worse than death."

Hannah said nothing at first. She studied him-the man who had once chased butterflies with her under the summer sun. A tide of emotion rose within her.Yet,beneath it all, that memory of betrayal-those secretly taken photos occupying the walls of that room-burned like an unhealed scar.

When she finally spoke, her voice was calm but laced with frost. "Claude, those photos in your house... You might've thought it showed your affection, but I only felt fear. Being watched without knowing, having every step recorded-that's not love. It's control.It's trespass. You're no longer the brother  I thought could trust."
Claude hurried to defend himself. "I'm sorry, truly! I already destroyed all of them, I swear! Anna, please-give me another chance. We can just be siblings again,I promise."

Hannah said nothing. Faced with her silence, he played his final card, the one he knew she couldn't easily dismiss. "I'm getting married soon," he said softly. "There's no way there could ever be anything between us now."

Hannah's eyes searched his, her face unreadable.

"I'd like you to come to my wedding," he continued,his tone imploring. "Please, Anna. It would mean the world to me. Without you there, I won't go through the ceremony. I want you to be there as a witness to the significant moment in my life." His words teetered between longing and emotional blackmail.

For a long moment, Hannah simply looked at him.Then, perhaps out of mercy-or fatigue-her heart relented. Maybe attending his wedding to see him settle down was the final thread she needed to cut.She exhaled quietly. "Fine. Send me the invitation when it's time."

A gleam of triumph flashed through Claude's eyes,though he masked it quickly with exaggerated gratitude. "Thank you,Anna! Thank you so much."

"I should go," she said, rising from her seat. "I've got work to do."

As Hannah's silhouette slipped through the cafédoor, the pleading mask on Claude's face fell away.In its place gleamed cold calculation. She was stil distant. But that was fine. The talk of their "brother-sister" relationship was merely a pretext to bridge.He couldn't risk falling apart from her now.

Once Bonnie gave him a child-his key to seizing the Hobbes family fortune-he would make sure Hannah would return to him, whether she wished it or not.They had all the time in the world.


******

Back at the company,Hannah wasted no time. She coordinated with the media, ensuring a thorough, transparent report on Rodney's case-laying out the timeline, the evidence, and the final verdict.

The piece painted the truh clearly: Hannah's courage as a victim, and Luminara Group's unwavering stand against corruption.

The tide of public opinion turned sharply in her favor once again. The company's stock soared, rising even higher than before.

Justice spoke at last. Those same executives who had once accused her of being reckless or short-sighted now had no words left. Facts had silenced them far more effectively than rebuke ever could.
###Chapter 646 Vera


Seizing the moment, Hannah called for a high-level meeting. Her tone carried both steel and authority as she sharply rebuked those hostile executives for their carelessremarks and indecisive conduct during the crisis. Punishments followed swiftly--salary deductions and temporary suspensions to reflect on their actions.

The storm of internal mistrust was, at last, brought to calm waters.

After setting things right, Hannah leaned back in her chair and pressed her fingers against her temples,feeling the weight of the day lift just slightly.

After a brief pause, she picked up her phone.Hesitation lingered for a heartbeat before she finally sent a message to Vincent. "The case is closed.Everything went smoothly. Do you want to have dinner together tonight?" She waited for what felt like an eternity, but the screen remained dark and silent-no reply came.

By the timne the clock struck the end of the workday,the message was still unanswered.

Perplexed, Hannah considered calling Derek to ask whether Vincent was tied up with work. But before she could, a notification flashed across her phone.

The headline was impossible to miss- "Exclusive:Famed Financier Vera Oliver Returns, Met by Vincent of Jones Group."

The caption below read, "Their manner seemed almost intimate, stirring whispers of a relationship."

Attached was a photograph taken at the airport-Vincent walking side by side with a woman dressed in a crisp, tailored suit. The camera angle made the two appear much closer than they probably were.

Hannah's grip tightened slightly around her phone,her expression unreadable. Was that a smile on Vincent's face? ******

Meanwhile, in the bustling arrivals hall of the international terminal, Vincent was indeed meeting Vera, his high school classmate. His memories of her were faint, like an old photograph left too long in the sun.

Their families had shared long-standing ties, yet the Oliver family had emigrated years ago, and contact had faded with time.

Vincent hadn't come to pick Vera up. He'd merely reached here to see off an important overseas client.But then, Danica had called, asking him to pick up Vera,who had just returned to the country.

The presence of media photographers at the airport was no coincidence. It had been arranged by Danica herself, clearly hoping to pair the two together.

Vera, pushing her luggage cart, approached Vincent with a teasing gleam in her eyes. "Vincent, it's been ages! You've grown even more dashing-and that commanding aura of yours hasn't faded one bit!" Her enthusiasm made Vincent uneasy. He merely nodded, polite but distant. All he wanted was to leave quickly.

Taking out his phone, Vincent began calling his driver while asking her in a measured tone, "Have you arranged somewhere to stay? I can have my driver take you there."

That was when he noticed Hannah's message inviting him to dinner. Almost without realizing it, a faint smile tugged at his lips-an unguarded softness rare for him.

Vera, watching him closely, caught it instantly. "Hey,what's got you smiling like that? Didn't even hear what I said!" she teased,leaning in with curiosity.

Vincent's poker face returned in an instant. He locked his phone and took a small step back, his tone cool and detached. "Miss Oliver," he said evenly,"you're overstepping."

Vera pouted, half in jest. "You're still the same as before-so cold! What's wrong with taking a peek?" Vincent ignored her, brushing aside the odd flicker of warmth that Hannah's message had sparked. He quickly typed a brief reply. "Busy."

Then, glancing at Vera, he asked,this time with clear impatience, "Which hotel are you staying at? I'll have the driver take you."

Vera's cheerful expression dimmed slightly as she stomped her foot in frustration. "I've told you several times! You weren't even listening. I haven't picked a place yet-and I'm not planning to stay in a hotel.Danica said I could stay at your family house." She took a step closer, eyes bright with mischief."You don't mind, do you?"

Vincent frowned faintly. The idea of a near-stranger staying under his roof didn't sit well with him, but arguing about it seemed pointless. Without further discussion, he turned to leave, saying only, "Hmm.Let's go back."
Vera tilted her head, watching him walk away,her thoughts spinning. Did that "hmm" mean yes or no?"Well,it hardly mattered. As long as she set foot in the Jones family house, she'd already gained a foothold.Vincent wouldn't turn her away, not in front of Danica. After all, both Danica and Sharon had adored her back in the day.

Soon, the car rolled into the Jones estate.

True to form, Danica was waiting eagerly outside.The moment she spotted Vera, she rushed forward with arms open. "Vera! You're finally back! I missed you so much!" she exclaimed.

Vera embraced Danica warmly, her voice syrupy and honeyed. "Danica, I missed you too! But most of all,I missed your cooking-it's still my favorite memory from home."

As a child with parents too busy to linger at home,Vera had often eaten her meals at the Jones household.
Now, slipping her arm through Danica's, Vera walked inside as if she were returning to her own house.

When they passed Vincent, Vera gave her suitcase a casual push toward him. "Vincent, I'll leave my luggage to you!" she said airily, flashing a charming smile before turning back.

Vincent paused, his gaze catching the curve of her backward glance. For a fleeting second, something stirred in his memory-an elusive sense of déjà vu that he couldn't quite place.
###Chapter 647 Vera Wanted To Get Close
A fleeting image stirred in Vincent's mind-a woman once turned to smile at him just like this, a smile so tender that it could melt iron. Back then, he hadn't resisted; he had pulled her close and kissed her.

Though the memory had blurred with time, he was almost certain that woman was Hannah.That brief recollection flickered across his face like a shadow passing over water.

Instead of lifting the suitcase himself, Vincent gave a quiet order to the nearby servant. "Take Mliss Oliver's luggage to the guest room."

Without sparing Vera or Danica another glance, he walked toward the living room.

For an instant, Vera's smile faltered, but Danica quickly filled the silence with bright chatter, linking arms with her as though nothing had happened.

Once inside the Jones family's living room, Vera's eyes roamed about before she exclaimed, a touch dramatically, "Wow! After all these years, nothing has changed! It's exactly like it was when I visited back in high school!"

Danica chuckled and gave her hand a fond pat."We've grown attached to this house. Every corner holds a story, so we can't bring ourselves to change a thing."

Vera sank into the main sofa as if reclaiming a throne."Even though it's been ages since I was last here,it still feels so familiar-like I never left!"

"Then make yourself at home," Danica said warmly."Stay as long as you'd like."

"Gladly! Thank you, Danica!" Vera replied in a cheery tone before turning toward Vincent, who stood quietly by the window. With a misplaced confidence, she strode to him, attempting to loop an arm around his neck. "Vincent,did you hear that? We'll be living together again!Doesn't it bring back memories of those high school days?"

She referred, of course, to the time when her parents had been away on business and she had stayed here for a while, days she clearly remembered more fondly than he did.

But before her fingers brushed him, Vincent shifted aside, avoiding her touch with a movement so smooth that it felt rehearsed. His gaze was frost itself when he said, "Miss Oliver, please mind our boundaries."

Her hand froze mid-air, awkwardness clouding her face like a passing storm. She pouted and turned to Danica,half-complaining. "Danica, look at him! After all these years, he's still so cold. He won't even let me touch him!"

Danica quickly stepped in, smoothing over the moment with a soft tone. "Vera, don't take it to heart.He's like that with everyone-it's nothing personal." Vera forced a laugh, feigning generosity. "Alright, For your sake, I'll let it slide."

Vincent had already tuned them out. He loosened his tie, irritation flashing briefly in his eyes. He still had a strong aversion to women who pushed boundaries and threw themselves at him. Yet, why was it that when Hannah drew near, even closer than this, he didn't recoil? Her touch didn't provoke annoyance;it kindled something entirely different. Desire.

He quickly shook off the thought. Now was not the right moment to dwell on it.

Just then, the sound of a cane echoed from the hallway, and Sharon appeared, moving with measured grace.

The moment Vera saw Sharon, her face lit up with delight. She rushed over and wrapped Sharon in a hug. "Sharon, I've missed you so much! Did you miss me?"

Sharon smiled and patted her back gently. "Of course, I did. Let me take a good look at you."  When Sharon pulled away, her eyes softened. "Still as pretty as ever-you haven't changed at all."

Vera straightened proudly, teasing, "Oh, but I have changed! I've grown taller-and these have grown bigger too!"

She made an exaggerated gesture toward her chest.

Traditional as Sharon was, her cheeks warmed with embarrassment. She lightly tapped Vera's arm. "A young lady shouldn't talk like that!"

Vera only laughed it off. "Come on, it's just us here!"Her gaze flickered toward Vincent, hoping he'd glance over.

But Vincent didn't. His attention was fixed on his phone, brows drawn slightly together as though waiting for something important.

Soon, a servant entered to announce that dinner was ready.

Vincent slipped his phone into his pocket. "You all go ahead," he said coolly. "I'll change first." He headed upstairs and took a quick shower. When he emerged, dressed in casual clothes and fastening his last button, the door suddenly swung open.

Vincent's expression hardened instantly. Standing there, uninvited, was Vera. His tone dropped to a glacial calm. "Has no one ever taught you to knock before entering someone else's room?"
###Chapter 648 The Master Bedroom

Vincent's gaze was sharp as a blade, and its chill made Vera's heart falter for a moment. Still, she clung to their shared past like a shield. "Why so serious, Vincent? Back in high school, I used to just enter your room whenever I wanted. Since when did you start enforcing all these rules?"

His expression didn't soften; if anything, it hardened further,the displeasure clear on his face.

Realizing he was genuinely angry, Vera reluctantly retreated to the doorway. She gave a light, exaggerated knock on the open door, her tone half defiant. "There, I've knocked. Satisfied now?"

Vincent didn't even glance her way. He turned slightly,adjusting his sleeves, his voice cool and distant. "What do you want?"

Vera straightened up, speaking as though her request were the most natural thing in the world. "I just saw the servant put my luggage in the guest room at the end of the third-floor hallway. The lighting there is awful, and I don't like it. I'd rather stay in the master bedroom on the second floor-the one with the big balcony and private study. Your grandma said it's your room and told me to ask if you'd let me have it."

She fluttered her lashes, clearly hoping Sharon's name would sway him.

Vincent didn't hesitate. His tone was firm and absolute. "No."

The single word hit her like a slap. Her face fell. "Why not?That room is bright and spacious, and I'd feel much more comfortable there! Besides, Sharon said you haven't used it since your memory loss. It's just collecting dust-why not let
since your memory loss. It's just collecting dust-why not let me stay in it?"

Vincent's reply came cold and final. "No particular reasons. I said no, and that's final. If the guest room feels too small, I can book you a presidential suite at a hotel. You'll have all the space you want."

That master bedroom was more than just a room to him. Back when he had first returned home after losing his memory, the master bedroom had been the place he instinctively went to.

But the moment he stepped inside and saw the traces of another's presence-the feminine touch in every detail-his head had started to pound. Fragments of heated arguments had flashed across his mind like lightning behind clouds,leaving him uneasy and restless.

Later, he had learned from the servants that it had been his and Hannah's room post marriage and that she had personally designed every corner of it.

From that day on, he had never crossed its threshold again.Everyone had assumed he simply disliked the décor. But deep down, he knew it was something else-a quiet rebellion of the heart,resisting the ghost of a memory that might awaken too much emotion.

Vera, stung by his rejection, gave a small huff. "Fine,I'll stay where I'm told. No need to bite my head off."

Her eyes then swept over him, noticing his attire, as though preparing to go out rather than retire for the night. "Heading out this late?" she asked.

"Yes." His answer was curt, offering no further explanation.

"Going out to unwind? Take me along. I've just gotten back and could use some fun," she said hopefully.

"It's business," he replied flatly.
"Oh." The disappointment in her tone was unmistakable.

Without another glance, Vincent moved toward the stairs.

But Vera wasn't finished. "Oh, right! Tomorrow night, I'm hosting a party at Westview Restaurant. You have to come!"

Vincent paused mid-step, frowning. "I'm busy. I won't make it."

Vera crossed her arms, refusing to give up. "I don't care-you have to come! If you don't, I'll move the entire party to the Jones Group's lobby! I mean it!"

She wasn't bluffing-she was just the sort of woman who would make good on such a threat.

Vincent's expression darkened, and she quickly softened her tone. "Come on, Vincent. I've invited lots of our old high school friends. We haven't all been together in years. Who knows-it might even help you recover some memories."
###Chapter 649 Just Passing By

Vera had just learned from Danica at the dinner table about Vincent's memory loss-how he had forgotten only the past eight years, as if someone had sliced out a single Chapterfrom his life's book.

Vincent stayed silent for a few seconds before replying vaguely,"I'll check my schedule." He neither accepted nor refused outright.

To Vera, that response was already half a promise. Not saying no was close enough to saying yes. Her face lit up with satisfaction. "Alright then. I'll see you there!"

Vincent didn't linger. Without a backward glance, he strode downstairs, ignoring his mother's call to have something to eat,and left the house straightaway. He didn't bother calling Derek.Instead,he drove himself, planning to drown his inexplicable irritation in an ocean of unfinished work at the company.

But just as he arrived at the Jones Group building,his phone lit up with a message from Hannah."Vincent, you slept with me,and now you're chasing other women. You jerk."

Before he could read the content, the message was retracted almost instantly. He frowned and sent back a single question mark.

He was about to get out of the car, to walk into the building and lose himself in paperwork, but his hand on the steering wheel seemed to act on its own. The next second, the engine roared back to life.

Before his mind caught up, the car was already turning,speeding toward Sterling Heights.

And by the time realization hit him, he was standing before

And by the time reslization hit him, he was standing before Hannah's apartment door

He raised his hand to knock-but stopped rudaiir. Vmat ori earth was he doing? It was nearly midnight. Here he was, like a lost fool, standing at his ex-vife's door under the cold stare of the hallway lights

Irritated at his own lack of control, he turned to leare

Just then, the door behind him clicked open.

A young man, bare-chested and wearing orily casual pants.poked his head out. Seeing Vincent, he blirked im confusion before muttering. "So, not the delivery guy."

Vincent's face darkened immnediately. Frorn inside the room.bursts of male laughter drifted out, confirming the man wasnr't alone.

The half-naked man looked Vincent up and dovm. and suddenly, his expression shifted into ane of playful understanding. "Ah, I get it!" he said. grinning "You'ne the new escort Ms. Scott ordered, right? Come on in-dorr't just stand there gawking!"

Vincent's expression turned as cold as steel Without a word,he strode in.

What rnet his eyes made his blood simmnem. Hamnah wias lounging lazily on a soft sofa, surrounded by several helf-dressed men. One was massaging her shoulders, another was holding a wine glass to her lips; a third was fumbling through a card trick, hoping to amuse her.

The moment Vincent stepped inside, the ar icself seered to freeze. His gaze, sharp and cald, swept across the room tke a blade.

The man at the door announced proudly, "Ms. Scott lood The new escort you ordered is herel"

Hannah,who had been resting with her eyes closed, opened them slowly. When she saw Vincent's storm-dark face,a flicker of surprise flashed in her eyes-but it vanished as quickly as it came. Her lips curved into a teasing smile."Vincent?What brings you here?"

His jaw tightened, and he forced out three clipped words. "Just passing by."

Hannah's smile deepened,laced with mockery. "Really? Passing by my doorstep at midnight?"

Vincent ignored her taunt, his gaze locked on her, unwavering.

Hannah, seeing his silence, only looked more amused. She waved casually at the male escorts. "Keep going. Don't stop."

She took a shallow sip from a glass handed over by the escort who whipped up the drink. She then plucked a bank card from the table, slipping it into the waistband of the escort's pants."This drink's pretty good," she said with a smirk. "I like it."

The escort grinned, emboldened by the tip, and leaned close to whisper in her ear, "Ms. Scott, I'm good at kissing. Want to test that too?"

Hannah's eyes, however, stayed fixed on Vincent's face-now darkened with restrained fury. Her lips curved again, drawing out the word like silk. "Sure..."

Something snapped inside Vincent. A blurred image flickered through his mind-Hannah in some dimly lit bar, putting on that same smile, teasing another man with the same careless charm.

A tide of emotion surged through Vincent, heavy and uncontrollable. Before he knew it, he had stepped forward,roughly shoving the escorts aside. He caught Hannah's wrist and yanked her up from the sofa.
###Chapter 650 Compensation

Hannah jerked in surprise, her voice rising in protest as she fought against Vincent's hold. "Vincent, release me right now!"

Vincent's response was to pull her closer. His other arm encircled her narrow waist, locking her firmly against his chest until barely any space remained between them. His words came out cold and sharp as he addressed the bewildered male escorts scattered throughout the room, "Everyone out. Now."

The escort who'd been leaning in to kiss Hannah retreated a step,clearly unnerved by Vincent's commanding presence. Yet,witnessing Hannah trapped in Vincent's grasp sparked defiance in him, and he challenged, "Who exactly do you think you are?She's the one who brought us here! We're all professionals in the same business-what makes you think you can monopolize her? Trying to claim everything for yourself?"

Vincent's voice dropped to something darker and more threatening. "Refusing to leave? Fine. I'll contact the police immediately. It's well past midnight, and you're creating a disturbance with all this noise. I'm curious how confidently you'll explain the exact nature of your 'professional services' to law enforcement."

Hannah remained trapped within Vincent's embrace, her struggles accomplishing nothing against his strength. She tilted her head back to study his furious expression, something unfamiliar stirring inside her chest.

With a resigned exhale, she addressed the male escorts,who were now exchanging uncertain looks among themselves,"Just leave. I'll pay for the entire evening. He's not making empty threats, so don't make this worse for yourselves."

The escorts, weighing Hannah's warning against Vincent's
The escorts, weighing Hannah's warning against Vincent's intimidating demeanor,reluctantly collected their things and filed out quickly.

The final escort pulled the door shut, leaving the spacious living room occupied by only the two of them.

Vincent's hold on her waist slackened somewhat as he poised to let her go.

But the instant his arms began to withdraw, Hannah rose onto her toes, her arms sliding around his neck as she eliminated the gap between them once more. She tilted her head back, a smile curving her lips as she murmured close to his ear, "Mr.Jones, you've disrupted my evening plans... Since you've spoiled my entertainment, how exactly do you intend to make it up to me?"

Vincent offered no response. Instead, he pried her arms from around his neck with deliberate force. In one swift motion,he pushed her, pressing her down into the plush sofa cushions.His arms braced on either side of her body, caging her completely beneath him. His voice emerged low and laced with anger."Will this suffice as compensation?"

Hannah flinched slightly at his aggressive approach, but recovered quickly,meeting his fierce stare with brazen defiance."Fine then, Mr. Jones. You'd better prove yourself tonight.I'll need performnance equivalent to at least eight men, or this won't come close to covering what I've lost."

Anger already simmered beneath her skin from witnessing him with that mysterious woman in the airport, and his current behavior only stoked her rebellious streak further. She reached up boldly, her fingers working at the buttons of his shirt.

Her movements were bold and unabashed. Watching her nimble fingers unfasten each button while remembering the room crowded with male escorts moments ago, Vincent felt rage flare hot inside him. He seized her wrist in a punishing grip
rage flare hot inside him. He seized her wrist in a punishing grip that made her flinch, his voice caustic with mockery. "Hannah,does any man who catches your eye end up in your bed? Do you have no regard whatsoever for your own dignity?"

Those final words struck Hannah like a blade straight to the heart. Her hands went still. She stared up at him, shock flooding her features. Was this truly his opinion of her? In his mind, was she really that sort of woman?

Fury ignited through her entire body, making her tremble as she shot back recklessly, "So what if I am? That's none of your concern!"

The atmosphere grew dense and suffocating, charged with unbearable tension.

Vincent's eyes turned glacial. "Eight men in a single night? Even if you don't find that revolting,I certainly do!"

He pushed himself off her abruptly, rising to his full height as he began restoring order to his rumpled shirt.

Hannah,incensed by the contempt radiating from him, pulled herself upright and released a harsh, bitter laugh. "Ha! What's so scandalous about multiple men in one evening? You appear to have forgotten I've ordered ten escorts for a night before!Haven't you always been aware of that?"

She layered her voice with theatrical emphasis as she continued,"Oh! I nearly forgot you've lost your memory." You can't recall any of it. No worries. Allow me to refresh your memory. I've always lived exactly as I pleased, treating romantic entanglements like fleeting fashion trends, here today,discarded tomorrow!"

Vincent's fingers stilled briefly on a shirt button, his eyes finding hers with an expression too complicated to decipher."And you claimed you wanted to pursue me again. Is this your idea of courtship?"


Hannah's thoughts swam in a haze of fury. desperate only to mflict maximum damage with her words. "Pursue you7 Ha...Surely,you can see I've never suffered from a shortage of menl That declaration before? I only said it because you looked so pathetic after losing your memory. I was simply toying with you!You didn't actually take it seriously, did you?"
###Chapter 651 Heated Argument

The remark sliced through Vincent like a blade drawn across bare skin. His gaze turned to ice-cold, unyielding,stripped of all warmth. "I shouldn't have come here in the first place," he muttered with biting mockery.

With deliberate movements, he fastened the final button of his shirt,straightened the stiff collar, and thought bitterly that only a fool with nothing better to do would show up in the dead of night just to be humiliated.

Hannah watched his aloof demeanor, eager to distance himself,her own chest heavy with a storm of anger and hurt. Unable to restrain herself, she prodded him with venomous sarcasm."What's this? Already leaving? Not staying to take things further?"

Vincent's eyes lowered, filled with disdain so sharp that it could cut. "Hannah," he said coolly, "is there truly nothing inside your head except sex?"

A bitter laugh escaped her, sharp and hollow. "Yes, that's all I think about," she spat. "I crave men endlessly and can't resist them. Is that what you wanted to hear?"

For a fleeting moment, Vincent regarded her as if he were seeing a stranger and then shook his head slowly. When he finally spoke, his tone was heavy with disappointment."Sometimes,I genuinely question how I ever ended up marrying you. It seems my judgment-before I lost my memory-was abysmal."

His words pierced through Hannah's chest, clean and deep like the twist of a knife. She swallowed the ache rising in her throat and forced out a cold, brittle laugh. "If that's true, then mv
and forced out a cold, brittle laugh. "If that's true,then my judgment was worse. I wasted eight years of my life on someone as heartless and self-centered as you."

Vincent offered no reply; exhaustion had dulled the sharpness of his anger. His face settled into calm detachment as he changed the subject, his voice distant and resolute. "The whole idea of bed partners is off the table. Considering how many men orbit around you, I wouldn't stand a chance anyway."

Without waiting for her reaction, he turned toward the door and walked away, his steps steady and final.

Hannah's vision blurred with rage. Watching his cold, retreating figure, all the resentment, humiliation, and pain she had buried deep came bursting forth. She seized a glass from the table and hurled it with all the strength in her trembling arm.

The glass struck Vincent squarely between the shoulders before bouncing onto the carpet, miraculously unbroken.

He froze, turned slowly, and touched the spot where it had landed. His gaze met hers-glacial, unreadable.

Hannah hadn't expected it to hit. A flash of panic crossed her face, but she refused to let it show. "You deserved it!" she snapped defiantly.

Vincent's expression remained inscrutable as he studied her in silence for a few long seconds. Then, in a voice so quiet that it carried more weight than a shout, he said, "Unbelievable,"

He turned again and exited, not sparing her a final glance.

The door slammed shut behind him.

Hannah's strength collapsed all at once. She sank onto the sofa,her heart pounding, her mind spinning. She had meant to ask him about the woman at the airport, but now, after this bitter exchange, it no longer mattered, All that remained between them was disappointment and exhaustion.
She sat in silence, tears threatening but unspilled, wondering if Vincent had been right all along. Perhaps they were simply never meant to be.



******

Downstairs, Vincent entered the apartment he had barely set foot in since that unexpected night between them.

However, sleep evaded him. The air felt thick with traces of Hannah's scent, an invisible presence clinging to every corner.

He lay restless in the dark, turning over every harsh word in his mind. He knew he'd gone too far. But watching her surrounded by men, hearing her deliberate provocations-something inside him had snapped. Logic had crumbled.

What was it about Hannah that unbalanced him so completely?Why did she have such a power to strip away his composure every time?

The hours bled away until dawn broke pale across the windows.He didn't have a wink of sleep the whole night. Without hesitation, he drove to the office.

He buried himself in endless work, hoping the mechanical rhythm of meetings and documents would drown out the noise in his chest.

As the evening settled, his phone began to vibrate relentlessly.

First came a cheerful message from Vera. "My party is about to start! Hurry up-everyone's waiting for you!"

Then, a text followed swiftly-this time from his mnother."Vincent, make sure you attend Vera's party. Don't make it difficult for me or disappoint her. You know the address."

He furrowed his brows. He flipped the phone facedown and returned to his paperwork, ignoring the buzzing that persisted across the table.
Moments later, the screen lit up with a call from his grandma.
He sighed, rubbing his temples before finally answering.

"Still busy, Vincent?" came Sharon's gentle yet firm voice from the other end.

"Yes, Grandma," he replied, his tone softening."Do you need something?"

"I know how you feel about crowded events," Sharon said kindly, "but this is Vera's first time back after so many years.She doesn't have much family here anymore, and our families have always been close. It's only right to show a bit of courtesy.I'm not asking you to stay long-just show up, greet everyone,spend around twenty minutes at most, and then leave if you must. How does that sound?"
###Chapter 652 | Can't Stand People Like Her
Sharon's words carried the weight of genuine concern and elder wisdom, making them impossible to dismiss.

Vincent had always held deep respect for his grandmother.After a long pause, he finally gave in with a quiet sigh. "Alright.r'ul be there."

"Good. That puts my mind at ease," Sharon said, her voice warm with satisfaction as she ended the call

Back at the Jones residence, Vera was getting ready with meticulous care. When she learned that Sharon had personally intervened and Vincent had agreed to come, she could barely contain her excitement. She beamed at Sharon with pure gratitude. "This is perfect! I knew if you asked him, he wouldn't refuse!"

Sharon reached out and patted her head affectionately."You're all alone here, Vera. Of course, we'll help however we can. Besides, it's just Vincent making an appearance. That's hardly asking much."

"Thank you so much, Sharon! You're absolutely wonderful!"Vera wrapped her arms around Sharon's in an affectionate embrace.

Sharon smiled warmly, giving Vera's hand a gentle pat before offering a few kind words and leaving the room.

Danica, who'd been helping Vera with her makeup, studied the stunning reflection in the mirror and spoke with genuine admiration. "Vera, you look absolutely radiant today! You'll be the most beautiful woman at the banquet tonight, without question!"
Watching Vera's graceful, poised demeanor, Danica felt a surge of satisfaction. This was exactly the kind of elegant, refined young woman her son deserved. She was determined to use Vincent's amnesia to her advantage, cutting all remaining threads between him and Hannah once and for all, and ensuring he ended up with Vera instead.

A delicate blush colored Vera's cheeks as she smiled shyly at Danica. "You're too kind! It's really because of the gorgeous dress and jewelry you picked out for me."

She hesitated for a moment and then turned to Danica with carefully measured curiosity. "Danica, would you mind telling me more about Vincent's ex-wife, Hannah? I've heard rumors that even after their divorce, things between them are still quite tangled?"

Vera's return to the country hadn't been purely sentimental.Her family abroad had been relentlessly pressuring her to get married, and the constant nagging had become suffocating.

Then, by chance, she'd run into Danica and discovered through their conversation that Vincent was divorced.

For Vera, this was an opportunity too good to pass up.Vincent's wealth, influence, and social standing were everything she'd ever wanted. Becoming Mrs. Jones would grant her prestige and freedom, letting her escape both her family's control and the isolation of life abroad.

With Danica and Sharon both clearly favoring her, Vera felt certain victory was within reach. The only real obstacle was Vincent's ex-wife,Hannah, who apparently refused to accept the divorce and kept finding excuses to insert herself back into his life.

The moment Vera brought up Hannah's name, disgust flashed across Danica's face. She squeezed Vera's hand,her voice dripping with scorn. "Don't waste your breath on that -hameless woman! They're divorced, yet she still haunts
shameless woman! They're divorced, yet she still haunts Vincent, constantly manufacturing reasons to stay in his orbit. If it weren't for her, Vincent never would have gotten into that accident and lost his memory. She's brought him nothing but misfortune!"

Danica's twisted telling transformed Hannah into a desperate,manipulative woman who couldn't let go after the divorce and had somehow caused Vincent's amnesia through her interference.

Danica conveniently erased any mention of Hannah's good qualities or the complex emotional entanglements between Hannah and Vincent, painting Hannah as solely responsible for everything that went wrong.

Understanding dawned in Vera's eyes, mixed with contempt.So,Hannah was one of those pathetic women who couldn't accept rejection. Her curiosity about Hannah only intensified. "The way you describe her makes me want to meet her even more."

Danica's frown deepened, irritation sharpening her words."What's there to see? She's just another ordinary woman who uses her face and cheap tactics to lure men in. I can't stand people like her!"

Danica's harsh words about Hannah masked something deeper,something she refused to acknowledge even to herself.Jealousy.

Both Danica and Hannah had married into families far above their original stations. After Hannah's divorce, Danica had expected her to fade into obscurity and struggle. Instead,Hannah had flourished. She'd built a successful business career,becoming a CEO people actually respected,living a life full of purpose and excitement, while Danica remained stuck in the family estate, her relationship with her son growing more strained by the day.

The gap between expectation and reality gnawed at Danica.
The gap between expectation and reality gnawed at Danica.Facing Hannah made her feel inferior and diminished somehow,and that was something she absolutely refused to tolerate. It only hardened her determination to keep Vincent and Hannah apart permanently.

Vera watched Danica's expression shift with careful attention.Her interest in Hannah intensified with every passing moment.She'd never been intimidated by competition. If anything, rivals made the game more entertaining. Besides, with Vincent's memory wiped clean of his marriage, she and Hannah were starting from the same place in his mind.

Precisely speaking, compared with Hannah, Vera surmnised that she had distinct advantages-she was favored by both Vincent's mother and his grandmother, while Vincent had no recollection of Hannah anymore. And not to mention the unmistakable disdain Danica harbored toward Hannah.

Vera couldn't wait to see what Hannah possibly had in her arsenal that could compete with all of that.
###Chapter 653 Met Danica

Vera paused before the glass, taking in every contour of her face as if cataloguing the effect of the evening's preparations;confidence slowly eased into a knowing curve at the corners of her mouth.

Tonight's occasion doubled as more than a mere homecoming celebration-it had been arranged with surgical precision to function as an elite financial networking soirée.

Her plan was sharp and unapologetic: to plant herself squarely in Vincent's thoughts as the ideal companion for his career trajectory. Tonight, she intended to cement, in plain sight, the superiority of her claim to the future title of Mrs. Jones.

Meanwhile, in the CEO's office at the Luminara Group,Hannah concluded a transcontinental video briefing and let the last virtual faces fade from her screen.

Meagan entered with a soft knock and the practiced poise of someone used to smoothing logistical edges. "Ms. Scott," she reported,"there's a private financial networking gathering tonight at 7 p.m. in the Westview Restaurant's top-floor banquet hall. Several senior figures and potential collaborators will show up. Would you like to attend?"

Hannah barely hesitated; she snapped the folder shut and nodded.Yesterday's clash with Vincent still nagged at the edges of her concentration, and she resolved to pour herself into work as a kind of remedy.

Meagan gave a slight nod. "Noted. This arrived from Mr. Kane Sampson, founder of KeenCrest Capital." She set the invitation card on Hannah's desk.

"I've prepared four gowns. Which one would you prefer?"
"I've prepared four gowns. Which one would you prefer?"Meagan said.

At Meagan's signal, attendants carried in four evening gowns,each cut in a distinct silhouette.

Hannah's eyes travelled across the selections before resting on a mist-blue gown. "That one." She glanced at her watch and added, "It's getting late. Have it packaged. I'll change at the hotel."

Meagan acknowledged the instruction and immediately set about arranging the garments.

Hannah bowed her head once more and skimmed the final pages that awaited her signature. Now and then, her gaze wandered involuntarily to her phone, where the last message from Vincent had stalled on a solitary question mark with no reply.

She forced her attention back to work, scrawled her name at the bottom of the documents, then gathered her clutch and car keys and departed the office.



The Westview Restaurant sat a considerable distance from the Luminara Group, and with the evening's congestion, Hannah arrived to find the networking event already in full swing.

She hurried toward the banquet hall entrance, only to be halted by an unexpected figure-Danica.

Having circulated among the attendees with a bright smile moments before, Danica's countenance had hardened the instant she spied Hannah. Excusing herself from her conversation, she had nearly rushed across the foyer.

Positioning herself in Hannah's path, Danica demanded with open hostility, "What are you doing here? You weren't invited -leave at once."

Hannah's face registered surprise at the sight of Danica. This was supposed to be a financial networking affair; why was Danica doing here?

Suppressing her astonishment, Hannah maintained poise and replied evenly, "Why would I be unwelcome? Do you own the place?"

Danica lifted her chin with insolent assurance. "Exactly.Westview Restaurant belongs to the Jones Group. Without an invitation, no one gains entry."

Convinced Hannah could not possibly possess an invite,Danica's voice sharpened. "Why aren't you leaving yet? Stop making a spectacle of yourself."

Unshaken, Hannah produced the invitation from her purse and handed it to the bewildered security guard. "Actually, I have been invited. Please verify it."

Danica's eyes widened in disbelief as she snatched the invitation from the guard and inspected it thoroughly.When she ascertained its validity, her expression soured.

As they verified the invitation, Hannah slipped past Danica and stepped inside the banquet hall.

Hannah took in the lavishly decorated room-a departure from the austere financial salons she typically attended. Without delay, she followed the directional signs toward the lounge to change into her gown.

Danica hustled over to Vera, who was engaged in light conversation and laughter with several guests, and pulled her aside to whisper urgently, "Vera, a problem-that Hannah somehow got in."

Vera's smile faltered; disbelief flickered across her face.′′HOW is that possible? I never sent her an invitation. How did she obtain one?"
Her meticulously planned evening could not tolerate an uninvited woman stealing her spotlight.

Danica frowned. "I don't know how she got the invitation,but I checked-it's genuine." Then, as if struck by a new tactic,she added with thin relish, "She arrived in a business suit, not an evening gown. We can use that to humiliate her publicly.Better yet, have her removed."
###Chapter 654 Grabbing The Spotlight
Vera's eyes sparkled with malicious delight, a cunning smile curving her lips. "Danica, you always know exactly what to do!I'm counting on you for this. Make certain Hannah learns some manners."

Vera's mind was already racing ahead, plotting her perfectly timed intervention with a pre-selected secondhand gown for Hannah, right after Danica had thoroughly humiliated Hannah.Among the elite, appearing in a secondhand dress carried far more shame than simply being underdressed.

Vera leaned toward her assistant, whispering urgent instructions to have the "special" gown prepared immediately.

Brimming with self-assurance, Danica rallied a cluster of privileged socialites known for their cruel games and marched off to publicly corner Hannah.

Yet, as they entered the hall, Hannah stepped out from the lounge.

For a moment, the buzz of conversation seemed to fade into silence.

Hannah had changed into the mist-blue gown. The elegantly understated dress draped her frame flawlessly, highlighting every graceful line and curve. Her mere presence commanded attention from several powerful industry titans and influential financial magnates scattered throughout the room.

Within moments, guests began gravitating toward her naturally,not just exchanging pleasantries but eagerly pressing business cards into her hand, hoping to secure her contact information.

Danica stood frozen, staring in utter disbelief at the unfolding scene. Every carefully rehearsed, harsh word she'd prepared to embarrass Hannah dissolved into nothing. The words burst from her lips before she could stop them. "Hannah, when did you even change clothes?"

Hannah had just wrapped up a pleasant exchange with a prominent banking executive. She turned to Danica with composed indifference. "Moments ago. Is there something you need?"

Her expression conveyed the unspoken question perfectly: since when did her wardrobe choices or the timing of changing require Danica's approval?

Danica found herself rendered speechless by Hannah's effortless dismissal, her face cycling through shades of crimson embarrassment and fury.

From her vantage point, Vera had been monitoring the situation closely and witnessed Hannah's breathtaking transformation firsthand.She could only watch in mounting frustration as the distinguished guests she'd personally invited, including several she'd been desperate to impress but hadn't yet approached,flocked to Hannah instead.

The spotlight that should have remained fixed on her as hostess had shifted dramatically. The carefully orchestrated "leading lady" aura she'd spent hours perfecting crumbled effortlessly in Hannah's presence.

Vera's fingers tightened around her champagne flute until her knuckles went white. Her gaze shot upward to the second floor balcony. Vincent had been there just minutes ago,casually sipping wine among his circle of friends. Now, the space stood vacant.

Panic seized her chest as her eyes swept frantically across the venue, finally landing on Vincent tucked away in a secluded first-floor corner. He'd descended without her noticing, wine
first-floor corner. He'd descended without her noticing,wine glass in hand, his attention unmistakably trained on Hannah's direction.

A vicious surge of jealousy ignited in Vera's veins. She refused to let her moment be eclipsed like this. Every eye in this room needed to return to her, where they belonged.

She thrust the secondhand dress at her assistant with barely concealed fury. "Dispose of it. Now!"

Steel glinted in her eyes as she rushed backstage for a pair of scissors.

When Vera swept back into the center of the ballroom several minutes later, she'd undergone a complete transformation. Her once-elegant evening gown now featured a plunging neckline slashed dangerously low, exposing expanses of bare skin and dramatic cleavage. The hemline had been hacked up to mid-thigh, transforming the refined dress into something provocatively daring.

At her signal, the DJ switched tracks, and a theatrical spotlight blazed down on her alone.

As a sultry, pulsing rhythm flooded the room, Vera launched into an uninhibited, seductive performance that demanded attention.

Every movement dripped with calculated sensuality, her body language leaving nothing to the imagination as she commanded the room's attention, sparking a chorus of appreciative whistles and raucous cheers.

Just as she'd predicted, every gaze snapped back to her provocative dance, the crowd surging forward to encircle her once again.

Satisfaction coursed through Vera as she reclaimed the spotlight mid-dance. She shot a provocative look toward Hannah, only to watch Hannah glance up with mild disinterest
Hannah,only to watch Hannah glance up with mild disinterest before returning seamlessly to her conversation with the guests surrounding her.

Frustration gnawed at Vera's satisfaction, and as her body continued moving to the rhythm, her eyes desperately sought out Vincent in that secluded corner, only to discover he'd vanished entirely.
###Chapter 655 You Fancy Her Too
Vera's eyes swept the bustling hall, anxiety flickering behind her composed smile-until her gaze finally caught Vincent's familiar silhouette. He was standing near the bar, a solitary figure with a drink in hand, his expression unreadable, yet his line of sight seemed to be directed toward her.

A soft, knowing smile curled across her lips. Of course.Men were creatures ruled by sight, and Vincent was no different.She had captured his attention exactly as she'd intended.

Her confidence surged, and with each beat of the music,her movements grew bolder-every turn, every sway of her hips executed to inflame his focus further.

At the bar, however, Vincent's attention wasn't on Vera at all.His gaze had been fixed, unblinking, on Hannah. He had been upstairs earlier when a glance across the railing revealed her below. For one fleeting second, he thought she had come in search of him, and that thought was enough to draw him downstairs.

But the moment he saw her laughing easily among a circle of men, charming each of them with effortless grace, that illusion had shattered. She wasn't here for him. The glass in his hand creaked under the pressure of his tightening grip. Watching her tilt her head back in laughter felt like a quiet knife twisting in his chest. He emptied his drink in one hard swallow, the burn doing little to quell the unease clawing at him.

"Vincent, what's with that face? You look like you've lost a fortune." The teasing voice came from beside him-Ansell Fowler, an old classmate from high school who'd shared a few pleasantries with him moments earlier.

Ansell plopped down beside Vincent at the counter, elbowing him in jest.

Vincent tore his gaze away from Hannah, his expression frostbitten. "Too loud in here." His tone was clipped,edged with irritation. The pounding bass and overlapping chatter made his temples throb. He felt incredibly agitated.

Ansell chuckled, following Vincent's line of sight toward the stage where Vera was still dancing. "Loud, yeah-but worth it.Look at her. Vera's on fire tonight! Can't say I mind the view."

Vincent said nothing, his features blank as he poured himself another drink.

Ansell rambled on without pause, his voice carrying a hintof mischief as his eyes drifted away from Vera's direction toward the far end of the hall. Suddenly, his face lit up with boyish excitement. "Vera's hot," he said, leaning closer to Vincent,"but check this out. I've found someone even more breathtaking. Over there,look!"

Vincent didn't bother responding. His posture remained composed, detached, uninterested. But Ansell was relentless.He nudged Vincent again with his elbow, lowering his tone to a whisper brimming with enthusiasm. "See that woman in the blue dress? The one talking to Mr. Sampson? I've had my eye on her all evening. She's on another level-class, beauty, that figure-like she walked straight off a movie set. I swear, she's the most stunning woman here. Shame she's surrounded by half the men in the room. But once they clear out, I'm definitely introducing myself."

Vincent had been tuning out Ansell's chatter-until his gaze followed Ansell's gesture. The moment his eyes landed on the woman in the blue dress-unmistakably Hannah, his voice came out low,measured, but razor-sharp. "You like her?"

Ansell, oblivious to the tension simmering beside him, gave a careless laugh and leaned back, grinning. "Like her? Hell yes
-
eless laugh and leaned back, grinning. "Like her? Hell yes.She's got that rare kind of beauty-tight waist, legs for days,the kind of woman who could ruin a man in the best way possible." He chuckled crudely, shaking his head. "If I could get her in bed and make her scream my name, I'd keep her in bed for ten days straight-"

The sound of glass slamming against wood cut through the noise like a gunshot. Vincent's tumbler shattered against the counter, his eyes, dark and fathomless, locked on Ansell with lethal stillness.

Every trace of emotion had drained from Vincent's face,leaving behind something far more dangerous. Nothing provoked him more than hearing another man fantasizing about Hannah in such a vulgar way.

Before Ansell could blink, Vincent's fist crashed into his jaw.

Ansell stumbled backward, catching himself on the bar as pain and fury flashed across his features. "What the hell is wrong with you? Why'd you hit me?"

Vincent straightened, flexing his wrist with unhurried precision.His tone was glacial, cutting through the thundering music."Be glad I held back. Now, get lost."

Ansell's pride flared despite the warning in Vincent's voice."What's your problem? What, you fancy her too? Damn, we can both admire her. She's just a woman..."

He never finished the sentence. Vincent's second punch came faster and heavier, cracking through the bassline that pulsed around them.

The fury radiating from Vincent was palpable, his entire presence turning frigid and suffocating. He glared down at Ansell as though staring at something filthy beneath his shoes.

Ansell's bravado collapsed instantly. Shaken, he clutched his bruised cheek, muttering under his breath as he backed away
bruised cheek, muttering under his breath as he backed away.Moments later, he disappeared into the crowd, eager to vanish from Vincent's sight.

The booming music and waves of laughter drowned the scene,concealing the brief violence as though it had never happened.

Up on stage, Vera's dance reached its feverish finale. Amid thunderous applause, she descended the platform, flushed and glowing under the stage lights. Her outfit-a daringly cut dress that left little to imagination-clung to her curves as she strutted toward Vincent.

Still, Vincent remained motionless, not even granting her the courtesy of a glance. His very presence radiated an unspoken warning-a cold, impenetrable aura that made it clear no one should dare draw closer.

Sliding onto the stool beside him, Vera leaned in with a playful tilt of her head, her voice syrup-sweet. "Vincent, did you see me dance? Tell me it was mesmerizing."

She cupped her face, pouting with deliberate charm, waiting for a trace of approval.

Vincent's jaw tightened, irritation flickering in his eyes. "How would I know?" he muttered, his tone flat, almost dismissive.

Her smile wavered, but she pressed on, masking her hurt behind forced playfulness."Come on, just a few words. I want to hear what you think."

Finally,hne lifted his gaze-cold, impassive, utterly devoid of warmth. "Didn't watch. So I can't comment."

The words struck her harder than she expected. Her composure cracked, her voice rising. "Didn't watch? That's not true! I saw you looking at me-you were watching!"
###Chapter 656 The Challenge
Vincent saw no point in engaging with Vera's theatrics. Rising to his feet, he said coolly, "Regardless, I didn't watch you. And don't start entertaining delusional notions about me. Not every man finds your style appoealing."

Without waiting for a response, he brushed past her, leaving her stunned expression behind as he crossed the room toward a quieter corner sofa.

From there, his eyes naturally found Hannah-composed and poised amid a circle of seasoned financiers.

Vera's gaze followed him, her jaw tightening as she caught sight of his unwavering attention fixed on Hannah. A slow,bitter fire burned in her chest. Every meticulous plan, every detail she'd arranged to grab the night's attention, had been rendered useless. Worse still, the man she had sought to impress didn't even spare her a second glance. And all of it-every ounce of humiliation-was because of Hannah.

No. She refused to let it end like this. This was her evening,her stage, and she would not let anyone steal it away.

Swallowing the sharp sting of envy, Vera drew in a steadying breath and composed herself. Her smile softened into one of flawless grace as she stepped briskly toward the center podium,her heels clicking with confident rhythm. With a crisp clap of her hands,she called out brightty, "Ladies and gentlemen-may I have your attention, please?"

The sudden sound of the microphone cut through the low hum of conversation, prompting Hannah to pause mid-sentence with the circle of seasoned financiers surrounding her.

Hannah's attention shifted toward the podium,where a woman
Hannah's attention shifted toward the podium, where a woman stood under the soft glare of the stage lights. There was something faintly familiar about her-the face, the poise-but Hannah couldn't quite summon a memory to match.

Kane's smooth introduction soon bridged the gap in Hannah's curiosity-the woman on stage was Vera, a financier who had taken the lead in organizing the evening's event.

The name stirred a faint echo in Hannah's mind, as though drawn from memories. Still, she brushed the thought aside.preferring instead to quietly observe from her seat.

Under the gleam of the spotlight, Vera shone like a performer in her prime. Her confidence radiated as she said, "I am deeply thankful for everyone's attendance tonight. To me, this isn't merely a celebration-it marks a new beginning as I return to the domestic financial world, eager to channel my full potential."

At her signal, an assistant queued a sleekly edited promotional reel that splashed across the giant screen behind her. The presentation unveiled Light of the Future, a tech innovation fund bursting with ambitious ideas and futuristic designs-concepts that made the crowd lean in with palpable intrigue.

"I will be representing my father, who is currently overseas,"Vera declared with fervor, her eyes alight with purpose."Alongside several keystrategic partners, we are launching with an initial capital of one billion to empower emerging companies that dare to redefine technology! This is not merely about profit-it is about contributing to the technological renaissance of our nation."

Thunderous applause swept through the hall. Guests whispered to one another with admiration, clearly enthralled by her drive and vision.

Hannah,however, remained detached. She lifted her glass and took a measured sip; the gleam of the stage reflected faintly in
)

took a measured sip; the gleam of the stage reflected faintly in her wine. The project stirred no spark of interest in her.

Danica, seated nearby, viewed the spectacle with quiet satisfaction. Her approving smile lingered as she studied Vera,thinking that this was precisely the kind of woman her son should be with-ambitious,refined, and formidable in presence.

Meanwhile, Vera basked in the glow of admiration. Her gaze drifted instinctively toward the far corner of the room, where she spotted Vincent, seated with his usual composed indifference yet seemingly attentive to the stage. The sight of him appearing to watch her ignited a flicker of pride within her chest.

Buoyed by that fleeting satisfaction, Vera chose to seize the moment. With deliberate grace, she smiled and announced,"To ensure the utmost credibility and expertise behind Light of the Future, we are privileged to welcome a distinguished honorary advisor-a luminary in finance-Mr. Kane Sampson!"

The declaration sent an immediate ripple through the audience.

Murmurs spread like wildfire. Kane's reputationwas synonymous with trust and prestige, and his involvement would instantly elevate the project's standing.

The spotlight shifted, catching Kane as he rose with composed elegance.He offered a polite nod to the crowd-nothing more.

The brief acknowledgment earned polite applause, yet something in the air subtly shifted.

Vera's triumphant moment faltered. She had anticipated a rousing endorsement, perhaps even a few generous words from Kane to cement her authority. Instead, he resumed his seat with calm detachment, his demeanor giving nothing away.

A few observant guests exchanged quiet glances, sensing the faint ripple beneath the polished surface.

Vera's composure wavered further when she noticed Kane leaning slightly toward Hannah, engaging her in low conversation. The casual ease between them struck her like a hidden blow.

Throughout the evening, Hannah had remained serenely composed, her face a mask of unbothered civility. Yet, when Kane spoke to her, she turned and smiled-polite, genuine,and effortlessly graceful.

The simplicityof that moment made something tighten inside Vera's chest. Determined to reclaim her footing, she steadied her breath and forced a confident smile, fixing her gaze directly on Hannah.

Her tone was sweet, but the challenge behind it was unmistakable. "Since my return, I've heard much about Ms.Scott of Luminara Group-a woman whose achievements in venture capital are truly remarkable. Tonight, I would like to take this opportunity to extend an official invitation to Ms.Scott and Luminara Group to join our Light of the Future initiative, in the spirit of collaboration and shared success."

It was a move as elegant as it was dangerous. Accepting would place Hannah under Vera's spotlight-acknowledging her lead and submitting, however subtly, to her stage. Refusing,on the other hand, risked making Hannah appear small-minded,unwilling to contribute to a noble cause.

As Vera's words faded into the expectant hush, every gaze in the room shifted toward Hannah,waiting to see how she would respond.
###Chapter 657 Kane Allied With Hannah
Hannah lowered her glass of wine with unhurried poise, the faint chime of crystal against the table announcing her decision to respond on her own terms. She first inclined her head toward Kane with measured courtesy before rising with a quiet elegance that drew the room's attention. When she finally spoke, her voice carried the composed strength of authority."I appreciate your kind invitation, Miss Oliver. The vision behind Light of the Future is certainly magnificent."

Her words floated with grace, yet she smoothly steered the conversation to firmer ground. "That said, when it comes to joint ventures, the Luminara Group adheres to its own rhythm and investment philosophy. We prefer initiatives that have completed their preliminary trials and demonstrate a clear potential for synergy with the Luminara Group's long-term strategy."

The phrasing was polished, but the undertone unmistakable-Vera's proposal, though dazzling in ambition, was premature and misaligned with Luminara Group's pace.

A flicker of strain crossed Vera's face despite her attempt to maintain a pleasant smile.

Then, Kane's deep, steady voice cut through the atmosphere,commanding the room's attention. "Ms. Scott raises an important point. Investment isn't about the magnitude of funds -it's about timing, precision, and understanding."

Though phrased diplomatically, his statement unmistakably sided with Hannah.
Kane's tone softened into that of an experienced mentor as his qaze settled on Vera. "Vera, your aspirations are admirable, and

gaze settled on Vera. "Vera, your aspirations are admirable, and your energy commendable. But in venture capital, having capital and ambition alone will never suffice. One needs profound industry insight, clear discernment, and a reliable team.These qualities are not acquired overnight. You're still young-there's no need to charge forward too soon."

His words landed like ice water over Vera's burning determination. The implication was unambiguous-he would not endorse her project, nor would he serve as her advisor.

Vera's lips stiffened into a brittle smile as her posture froze in place,humiliation creeping visibly across her features.

Kane, however, had already withdrawn his attention, turning toward Hannah with the ease of long-standing familiarity."Speaking of synergy," he continued smoothly, "the proposal you mentioned earlier about co-founding the Cornerstone Tech Innovation Fund struck me as particularly sound. We should move forward with it as soon as possible."

The subtle weight of his phrasing carried enormous meaning.

By saying co-founding, Kane positioned Hannah not as a subordinate partner but as an equal collaborator-something worlds apart fromn Vera's one-sided invitation.

The contrast couldn't have been sharper. Vera had expended all her effort seeking Kane's validation, only to face rejection.Meanwhile, Hannah stood beside Kane as a peer, co-architecting a new financial venture.

The distinction was plain to all-Hannah was the one deemed truly capable, the one recognized by the field's most authoritative figure.

Below the stage, the shift in mood rippled like a current. The spectators-seasoned investors and social elites alike-were quick to read the change in power. Their once-admiring looks toward Vera transformed into glances of pity, even quiet
toward Vera transformed into glances of pity, even quiet amusement. In a single exchange, Kane's words had reduced Vera's earlier triumph into a spectacle of irony.

Maintaining her composure, Hannah inclined her head toward Kane with quiet modesty. "Mr. Sampson, you're too generous with your praise. I'm merely following the wisdom you've shared with us. I'll finalize the proposal and deliver it to you shortly."

That courteous exchange, though brief, sent a wave of excitement through the hall.

Conversations erupted across the room like soft thunder.

Clusters of elegantly dressed women gathered in corners,whispering behind painted fans and glimmering wine glasses.

"Who would've thought? It's Ms. Scott from Luminara Group who ended up partnering with Mr. Sampson."

"Exactly. He didn't even bother sparing Miss Oliver any face.Everyone thought he'd be her supporter, but he's allied with someone else."

"All that fanfare, just to have the spotlight stolen in an instant -poor Vera, she rose high, only to fall harder."

The comments, murmured yet cutting, drifted toward Danica,who stood nearby. Her gaze followed the scene on stage-Vera's frozen smile and the visible strain beneath it.

The whispers of ridicule and sympathy around her fanned the embers of indignation until they flared. Her composure snapped.Turning sharply, she glared at the gossiping women, her voice slicing through the chatter. "You all think you know what happened, don't you? Mr. Sampson was charmed by Hannah's tactics! That woman's craftiness runs deep. There's nothing she won't do to get her way. If she can seduce someone of Mr.Sampson's stature, then tell me-what can't she do?"
The outburst hung in the air for a heartbeat before detonating into an uproar of murmurs and astonished whispers, feeding the room's already ravenous curiosity.
###Chapter 658 What Video Was She Talking About
Every head swiveled toward Danica with curiosity and surprised gazes, and someone immediately asked, "Mrs. Jones, what exactly are you implying? Do you have some kind of insider knowledge? Are you saying Ms. Scott actually used those kinds of tactics?"

Finding herself at the center of curious and doubtful stares,Danica didn't hesitate for a second. She grew bolder, as though destroying Hannah's reputation could somehow salvage her own and Vera's standing. Her voice climbed even higher, words tumbling out with reckless abandon as if she wanted every person in the venue to hear. "Of course, I know the truth!Hannah was my son's ex-wife! How could I possibly be ignorant of her sordid past?"

Revulsion twisted her features. "The only reason she wormed her way into our family was by seducing my son! Even after the wedding,she couldn't behave herself, using her looks to get involved with other men, betraying my son repeatedly!"

Her agitation mounted with each word, and she even waved her phone dramatically, making a show of searching through it."I'm telling you, I have video proof of her messing around with some random man! If it weren't for protecting the Jones family name, I would have..."

"Danica." An icy voice sliced through her venomous tirade.

All eyes tracked toward the sound, landing on Hannah standing calmly at the crowd's periphery.
Hannah's face was unreadable, severe, and the phone in her grip displayed an unmistakable recording screen. She advanced with measured steps. "I've captured every single word you just
)
with measured steps."I've captured every single word you just spoke."

Though Hannah's voice remained quiet, it carried an undeniable weight that rippled through the assembled guests. "Inventing lies from nothing, spreading vicious and damaging falsehoods,inflicting serious harm to my reputation. You can expect legal papers from the court. I'm curious what consequences you'll face for such reckless public slander and lawbreaking."

Terror sent tremors through Danica's hand, and she nearly fumbled the phone she'd been brandishing. She clutched it desperately, voice rising in stubborn defiance. "Who-who do you think you're trying to intimidate? I was only joking around,and it's not like you were physically harmed! Does this really warrant such dramatics?"

"Joking?" Hannah's laugh was sharp and humorless, her gaze cutting across the watching crowd."Weaponizing such vicious lies to destroy a woman's reputation is just a joke in your eyes?"

Before Danica could formulate a response through her panic,Hannah moved with startling speed, plucking the phone from Danica's white-knuckled grasp.

"What are you doing? Return that immediately!" Danica shrieked, throwing herself forward to reclaim it.

Hannah evaded effortlessly, her fingers flying across the phone's gallery with purpose, quickly locating the fabricated video that Brinley had forged during Sharon's birthday celebration. She remembered with perfect clarity how Vincent had explicitly prohibited any photography or recording,yet Danica had filmed it covertly anyway.

Hannah's tone dropped several degrees colder as she pressed on. "You haven't merely slandered me with words. You've been hoarding this falsified video all along, intending to circulate it as a weapon against my reputation. Danica, you're just digging yourself deeper!"
Hannah snapped a photo of the screen for evidence. Then, as Danica watched in horror, she raised the phone high and hurled it violently to the floor.

The sharp crack of impact echoed as the device skittered and bounced across the marble.

"Hannah,have you lost your mind? What right do you have to destroy my phone?" Danica seized on this new grievance,jabbing her finger accusingly toward Hannah while hurling insults.

Hannah gazed down at her with chilling composure. "I destroyed it because I chose to. Do I require your permission?The same way you spread lies without needing proof?"

Dismissing Danica entirely, Hannah pivoted to address the cluster of witnesses surrounding them, her voice ringing clear and authoritative, "You've all seen and heard what happened here. Every accusation Danica leveled against me was pure malicious invention. And that supposed video she referenced is completely fraudulent. If I catch wind of tonight's gossip spreading anywhere, I won't think twice about naming each of you as defendants and pursuing full legal recourse."

Her eyes swept the assembled crowd, and not a single person dared hold her gaze. Without another word, she turned on her heel to depart.

Just then, a commanding figure materialized in her path.Vincent. Nobody had noticed his arrival.

His expression was thunderous, having caught portions of the ugly exchange between Danica and Hannah. His eyes locked onto Danica with cutting intensity. "What forgery video is she talking about?"

Danica flinched under Vincent's glacial stare but recovered her composure almost immediately. Vincent had lost his memory.He couldn't possibly know what had really happened. She had
He couldn't possibly know what had really happened. She had absolutely no reason to be panic.

Moving quickly, she snatched her phone from the floor and clutched it protectively against her chest, stammering out an evasive response. "N-nothing at all! That deranged woman Hannah was just spouting complete nonsense. You see what she did? She has zero respect for me. She actually hurled my phone to the floor! Vincent, that woman is genuinely terrible."

Vincent's gaze remained fixed on Danica, unyielding, his voice taking on a steely edge of command. "I'm asking you again.What video was she talking about?"

His hand extended deliberately, palm up, making his demand for her phone absolutely clear.
###Chapter 659 He Defended Her
Danica faltered beneath the weight of Vincent's commanding aura, her voice trembling as she avoided his eyes, clutching the phone as though it were her last defense.

Vincent's patience had long since run dry; a shadow crossed his face, dark and unyielding. Without further ado, he pulled out his own phone, his tone turning glacial as he declared, "I'm calling security."

The words hit Danica like a whip. The mere thought of uniformed guards surrounding her in front of this crowd was unbearable-she had already humiliated herself enough for one night. Panic flickered across her face as she blurted out, "Fine!You win! You're really the first son I've seen treat his mother this way."

Grumbling bitterly, she extended her phone toward him, the cracked screen glinting beneath the chandelier.

Vincent snatched it from her grasp. His fingers swept across the damaged screen with practiced precision until a particular video in the gallery caught his eye.

He tapped it open. The footage began to play-grainy, angled from a concealed position-and immediately, Hannah's figure appeared on the screen. She was surrounded by men, her vulnerability glaring and cruelly exposed.

Vincent's eyes hardened. He knew, without hesitation, that this was no genuine recording. The composition, the motion, the unnatural lighting-it reeked of fabrication.

Yet,as the images flickered before him, an inexplicable sense of familiarity took hold. It was as if he had witnessed it
familiarity took hold. It was as if he had witnessed it firsthand.

Without warning, an agonizing pain surged through his skull. He staggered, one hand gripping the nearby wall for support, cold sweat dripping down his temples.

Disjointed flashes burst across his mind. A ballroom drenched in golden light. Hannah was standing before him at Sharon's birthday party, her eyes glistening with unspoken heartbreak.

His own voice, fervent and desperate, was trying to explain something she refused to hear. Her hand struck his away.

There seemed to be many onlookers around, whispering and pointing.

Then came the sharp sound of paper hitting his chest-Hannah's trembling hands thrusting forward a divorce agreement.

A crushing wave of grief and isolation swept over him,suffocating and relentless.

The chaotic images stopped surfacing. His vision blurred, and for a moment, he thought he might collapse. He gasped for air.Slowly,the stabbing pain receded,leaving behind only a hollow ache.

His face fell as he stared once more at the false video. A storm brewed behind his eyes-rage, confusion, and something deeper, rawer. The truth that flickered within those memories told him there had been more to their story-a grave misunderstanding and harm between him and Hannah.

Slowly regaining control, he exhaled, face composed into a mask of icy resolve. Then, with deliberate finality, he deleted the video.

From her spot nearby, Danica observed Vincent silently, Seeing the video erased and reading the cold authority in his
the video erased and reading the cold authority in his expression, she quickly recovered her composure. She knew he no longer remembered the past-an advantage she intended to exploit.

Applying a tone dripping with moral disdain, she scoffed,"That's for the best! Even I can't stomach such filth. Vincent,you saw it yourself-Hannah has no sense of decency.Promiscuous, unrestrained, disgraceful. Divorcing her was the smartest thing you have ever done. Don't let her fool you again."

Vincent lifted his head sharply. His eyes, glacial and penetrating,locked onto hers. "Mom," he said, his voice cutting through the air like tempered steel, "do you really take me for a fool? Do you believe my memory loss means I've lost my ability to see through a cheap forgery?"

The color drained from Danica's face. Her lips parted, but no sound emerged. Only then did she realize with alarm that the man before her might have forgotten fragments of his life, but his instincts, his insight, his quiet ferocity remained untouched.Worse still, even without memories of Hannah,his soul still shielded Hannah as if bound by something beyond memory.The cold doubt in his gaze pierced her composure, chilling her to the core.

Without another word, Vincent tossed the phone back to Danica. It landed in her hands with a dull thud. Then, turning on his heel, he walked away, his stride unyielding, his silence more condemning than any rebuke.

Meanwhile, across the opulent hall, another confrontation simmered.

Vera had cornered Kane near the exit, her practiced smile straining beneath the weight of frustration. "Mr. Sampson," she began, her voice trembling with grievance masked by poise,"what's the meaning of this? We were getting along perfectly earlier. Your presence at my event was a sign of support, was it
earlier. Your presence at my event was a sign of support,was it not? Yet, you publicly turn around and side with Hannah-do you realize what that does to my reputation?"

Kane regarded her with quiet restraint. The genial warmth he had displayed earlier dissolved, replaced by a measured sternness. "Vera," he said slowly, "I came here out of respect for your father and because you invited me to what you described as a professional exchange. But what have l witnessed tonight? Loud music, flashing lights, and endless chatter-not exactly the environment for serious discussion,is it?”

He paused, his gaze firm and edged with disappointment."Tell me-since I arrived, have you sought my counsel even once as one eager to learn something? Have you shown the humility or diligence this field demands? Hannah, on the other hand, has spoken with me all evening about tangible matters-market dynamics, fiscal discipline, project viability. That is professionalism. That is the kind of mind one partners with."

Leaning slightly closer, his voice deepened with quiet reproach."And one more thing-regarding your proposal, I said it was worth considering, nothing more. I made no promise, no endorsement. So, this indignation of yours, this attempt to hold me accountable for a decision I never made-Vera, that's not how business works. You've strayed far from the essence of professionalism."
###Chapter 660 Spoke For Kane
Vera was struck silent by the precision and authority in Kane's reasoning, her cheeks igniting with a deep, humiliating red.

Yet,her pride refused to let the matter die. She clutched at words like lifelines, her tone trembling between panic and pleading. "Mr. Sampson, please-pardon my poor manners earlier! But this project stands apart from my manners! You can't just dismiss my competence over something sO insignificant! I beg you, reconsider-surely we can revisit the terms!"

Kane's expression softened with a trace of pity as he regarded Vera, whose attempts to win a partnership had dissolved into a display of desperation and misplaced sentiment.

With a weary sigh, he prepared to refuse her outright-until a cool,steady voice interrupted.

"Miss Oliver," Hannah's composed tone cut cleanly through the tension. "Mr. Sampson is advanced in years and deserves a measure of peace. Wouldn't it be improper to press him so insistently?"

Hannah stepped forward without fanfare, taking her place beside Kane with quiet assurance. Her gaze met Vera's with an unspoken dominance that filled the space between them.

Vera,already simmering with humiliation, felt her anger surge higher at the sight of Hannah. Old resentment and new humiliation collided in a flash of bitterness as she snapped,"This is between Mr. Sampson and me. It's none of your concern,is it?"

Hannah's response came not with anger but with a faint smile
Hannah's response came not with anger but with a faint smile that curved her lips. "Oh, but it is my concern," she replied,her voice edged with calm precision. "First, Mr. Sampson is now my valued business partner, so his comfort and choices naturally matter to me."

She paused briefly and then continued with unmistakable clarity,"Second, you claim this is between you and Mr. Sampson, but moments ago, on that very stage, you sought to force a not-yet-finalized collaboration onto Mr. Sampson, leveraging his reputation to boost your own project. That made it a public spectacle. The second you turned it into an issue of professional ethics, it became fair ground for anyone to address. As a member of the same industry, I see no reason to stay silent."

Kane gave a faint nod, quietly endorsing her words. The surrounding guests, now fully aware of what had transpired,exchanged disdainful whispers, their glances toward Vera sharp with judgment.

Vera stood motionless, heat flooding her face as the weight of humiliation pressed down. Just as she struggled to steady herself, movement across the hall caught her eye-Vincent,making his way through the crowd. Relief flooded her like oxygen to a drowning soul.

Forcing a strained smile, she rushed to Vincent, calling softly,"Vincent! You came for me? I just need to wrap up a few things-it won't take long."

She leaned in, hoping to create a sense of intimacy. However,Vincent subtly shifted aside, preserving a courteous distance.His attention barely brushed her before sliding past-to Hannah,standing poised beside Kane.

At the sound of Vera's call, Hannah turned, her eyes settling on the pair. Recognition flickered in her mind like a spark catching flame.So that was why Vera looked familiar.

A faint. cold smile tugged at Hannah's lips as the memory surfaced: a financial headline featuring Vincent and Vera side by side, smiling for the cameras.

Bitterness traced the edges of Hannah's calm. For someone as absorbed in his work as Vincent, to personally fetch a woman -it must be something more than business. The thought darkened her mood before she could stop it, shadows crossing her otherwise composed expression.

By now, Vincent had reached Kane, his manner all respect and restraint."Mr.Sampson," he greeted warmly, "it's been a while.You look as vigorous as ever."

Kane's eyes lit with genuine pleasure. "Vincent! I didn't expect to see you here. It's been far too long!"

Kane studied Vincent for a moment and then glanced toward Hannah beside him, an idea forming with evident enthusiasm."Vincent,your Jones Group wields considerable influence.How about joining the new fund Hannah and I are developing?"

A smile touched his face as he continued, his tone brimming with approval, "This will be Hannah's first time leading such a venture, but she has built a strong foundation. Her insight and tenacity have been remarkable-far beyond her years."
###Chapter 661 Are You Afraid
Kane remained oblivious to the tangled past between Vincent and Hannah. His thoughts were consumed by the pursuit of a mutually advantageous deal-one that could bring prosperity to every party involved.

Meanwhile, Vera, positioned slightly to the side, grew increasingly restless. She had meticulously arranged this banquet to elevate her own standing, yet somehow, the spotlight had drifted toward Hannah, even drawing Vincent into her orbit.

Panic flickered behind Vera's smile as she abruptly cut into the conversation, her voice edged with feigned concern. "Mr.Sampson, it's getting rather late, isn't it? You must be exhausted. I've prepared a car to take you home so you can rest properly!"

Her eagerness to send Kane off was palpable.

Hannah's calm voice soon followed, smooth and unhurried. "Mr.Sampson, allow me to drive you home."

Vera's expression hardened instantly. "That won't be necessary,Ms. Scott," she interjected briskly, her tone sharp. "I've already arranged everything for Mr. Sampson's evening. You don't need to trouble yourself."

At her cue, the vehicle she had prepared earlier rolled up to the entrance.

Kane, weariness faintly showing through his composed demeanor, gave her a small nod. "Thank you, Vera," he said appreciatively.

Just as the exchange settled, Vincent took a step forward,bowing slightly with deliberate courtesy.′′Mr. Sampson," he
ing slightly with deliberate courtesy. "Mr. Sampson," he began evenly, "regarding the investment partnership you mentioned earlier-the Jones Group finds it very promising.However, such an endeavor requires detailed analysis and careful assessment. Perhaps in the near future, I can continue this discussion with you and Ms. Scott more thoroughly."

As he spoke, his gaze intentionally drifted toward Hannah,who stood a few steps away. His tone conveyed deference toward Kane,cautious enthusiasm for the proposal, and the measured restraint of a man who understood diplomacy-all seamlessly intertwined.

Kane's smile deepened. "Very well. We'll revisit it when the time comes."

Vincent inclined his head respectfully. "Safe travels, Mr.Sampson."

Hannah stepped forward, sincerity softening her features. "Mr.Sampson, thank you for your time today. Take care."

A faint look of approval crossed Kane's face before he turned away,his assistant trailing behind as they exited the hall.

Once Kane departed, a heavy stillness settled near the entrance. The shift in atmosphere was subtle yet unmistakable.

Vera's calculating mind immediately whirred into motion.Watching Vincent and Hannah standing close by, she composed herself and flashed a cordial smile. "Ms. Scott," she said pleasantly, "since it's your first time attending one of my events, consider us friends now. A few of us are having a relaxed little get-together in the back lounge after this-just drinks and chatter. Why don't you join us? It'll be a great chance to get to know Vincent and everyone better."

Her tone was sweet, but her intentions were razor-edged. She didn't mind losing a business point tonight if it meant reminding Hannah who truly stood closer to Vincent.
Hannah,unwilling to engage in such games, answered without hesitation, "Thank you for the invitation, Miss Oliver, but unlike you, I don't have the luxury of unwinding tonight. There's still plenty of work waiting at the company. I'll be taking my leave."

Vera's smile faltered for half a second before she smoothed it back into place. Hannah's composure stung far more than an insult.

Still, Vera swallowed her irritation-she had plenty of ways to make Hannah uncomfortable if she dared to join. No need to win a verbal spat now.

"Now,now, Ms. Scott," Vera replied, feigning warmth. "Even the busiest people need a break sometimes! It's nothing formal -just a few friends, some light drinks, maybe a couple of fun games."

As she spoke, she reached out, attempting to hook her arm through Vincent's in a gesture that oozed familiarity. "Right,Vincent? We used to hang out like this all the time in high school."

But before her hand could touch him, Vincent moved with quiet precision, stepping aside just far enough to avoid her.

"No,thank you," Hannah said coolly, declining once again.She had no interest in watching Vincent indulge another woman's attention.

She turned to leave, but Vincent's calm voice suddenly broke the silence. "Are you afraid?"

Hannah froze mid-step, turning to meet his gaze. "Afraid of what?" she asked, her tone edged with defiance.

His lips curved slightly. "Then come."

Without waiting for her response, he strode toward the lounge where the private gathering was being held.

Vera quickly hurried after him, matching his pace and glancing back at Hannah with thinly veiled triumpoh.

Watching Vincent's retreating figure, Hannah muttered a few curses under her breath. What was there to feel uneasy about?It was just a party.

Straightening her shoulders, she followed after them, her pace deliberate and unhurried.

The back lounge was a world apart from the grandeur of the main banquet hall. Dim lighting bathed the space in a relaxed glow, and clusters of young men and women lounged comfortably on leather sofas, their laughter mingling with the clinking of glasses.

When Vincent and Vera entered, a cheer erupted from the group.

"Vera, Mr. Jones, finally! We thought you two ditched us!"

"Mr. Jones, still as dashing as ever! Vera, you really outdid yourself bringing him here!"

Vera basked in their teasing admiration, pride gleaming in her eyes. She shot a smug glance at Hannah-who had just walked in-before tugging gently at Vincent's sleeve. "Come sit here,Vincent," she urged lightly. "This spot has the best view."

But Vincent acted as though he hadn't heard her. Instead,he settled onto a single-seat sofa nearby, comfortably detached from the crowd.

Vera's hand hung awkwadly midair before she retracted it,covering her discomfort with a polished smile as she took a seat on the sofa beside him.

It was only then that one of Vera's friends, a young man named It was only then that one of Vera's friends, a young man named Boyce Hughes, noticed Hannah standing near the entrance.He leaned forward curiously, eyes narrowing with interest. "Vera,who's that?" he asked, his tone openly inquisitive.
###Chapter 662 Pointed Question
Vera's smile widened as she gestured gracefully toward Hannah.
"Everyone, this is Ms. Scott,a new friend of mine."

With theatrical enthusiasm, Vera indicated the sole vacant spot on the lengthy sofa, positioned as far from Vincent as physically possible. She pressed Hannah with exaggerated hospitality. "Ms. Scott, no need to be shy! Please, make yourself comfortable right there!"

Hannah's lips curved in a polite but cool smile as she bypassed Vera's designated seat entirely. Her eyes swept the room with practiced efficiency before she crossed directly to a solitary armchair positioned opposite Vincent. The placement put her in his direct line of sight, perfectly parallel.

"This will do nicely, thank you," Hannah remarked with unruffled composure, smoothly plucking a wine glass from a server's passing tray.

Vera felt no particular concern. Hannah could sit wherever she pleased, provided it wasn't beside Vincent.

"Well, now that we're all gathered, simply drinking seems rather dull, doesn't it?" Vera's friend, Debby Robertson, let out a delighted laugh as she clapped her hands together to capture everyone's attention. "Why don't we play a game? I've brought some rather entertaining cards!"

The proposal met with eager approval from Vera and the rest of their circle. After all, this intimate gathering had been meticulously arranged to engineer interactions between Vera and Vincent.

Vincent reclined in his armchair, wine glass balanced loosely
Vincent reclined in his armchair, wine glass balanced loosely between his fingers, his features betraying neither interest nor objection, as though he were observing from some distant remove.

Hannah occupied her seat across from him with quiet poise,taking measured sips of her wine.

The game's mechanics were straightforward: spin an empty bottle placed at the table's center, and whoever faced the bottle's neck would select a card from the deck and fulfill whatever challenge it contained. These tasks ranged from answering personal questions to executing various dares.

During the initial rounds, the bottle consistently selected Vera's other companions. They pulled innocuous challenges and lighthearted forfeits that generated steady laughter and maintained the party's buoyant energy.

Then, after yet another spin, the bottle's mouth swung decisively toward Vincent. Conversation died immediately,every pair of eyes locking onto him.

Vera especially felt her pulse quicken with anticipation.

Vincent's expression remained utterly neutral as he reached toward the card deck with casualness, extracting a single card.

Debby snatched it eagerly from his fingers and announced in a gleeful voice, "Kiss the first person of the opposite sex sitting to your left!"

"Whoa-" The room exploded with excited whoops and encouraging whistles.

Seated directly to Vincent's left was Vera. Color flooded her cheeks instantly as she ducked her head with shyness, fingers knotting together nervously, though she couldn't resist shooting a victorious glance toward Hannah.

Hannah's grip on her wine glass tightened almost imperceptibly.
Hannah's grip on her wine glass tightened almost imperceptibly.Her expression gave nothing away as she tipped her head back and drained the remaining wine in one smooth motion. Then,she lifted her gaze, letting it settle squarely on Vincent. She wanted to see what he would do.

Vincent raised his eyes, and across the crowded room, his gaze locked with Hannah's with unmistakable intensity.

As the excited chatter swelled around them, Vincent held his silence for several weighted seconds.

What he did next caught everyone off guard. Instead of looking at Vera, he reached for the liquor bottle on the table,filled his empty glass, raised it to the crowd, and said, "I'll drink three shots as a forfeit."

Before anyone could protest, he threw back three consecutive shots of harsh liquor without flinching.

The celebratory noise died instantly, replaced by uncomfortable silence.

The color drained entirely from Vera's face. She'd never imagined Vincent would dismiss her so thoroughly, so publicly.During their high school years, he'd always singled her out for special attention. Humiliation and crushing disappointment tangled inside her chest.

Debby jumped in hastily. "Well then, no sense stopping now!Let's continue!"

The game limped forward with renewed reluctance, the earlier festive energy unmistakably diminished.

Several spins later, the bottle's neck swung toward Hannah,who'd maintained her quiet observation throughout. All attention shifted to her.

Hannah placed her glass aside with deliberate care, extended her hand with unhurried confidence, and selected a card from
her hand with unhurried confidence, and selected a card from the deck.

Before Hannah could examine the card herself, Vera lunged forward and seized it from her fingers.

"Allow me to read Ms. Scott's challenge aloud!" Vera announced with forced brightness, her eyes scanning the text rapidly.

The original question was innocuous enough:′′|there anyone present who makes your heart race?"

Malicious intent flickered across Vera's features as she deliberately rewrote the question on the spot. "Ms. Scott,the card wants to know if you divorced because you'd fallen for another man?"

The inflammatory question detonated like a bomb among the guests.

"Divorce? Wait, shewas married before?"

"Did she actually have an affair?"

Vera's circle erupted into scandalized murmuring, studying Hannah with expressions mixing voyeuristic fascination and open scorn.

Vera fixed Hannah with a triumphant stare, practically savoring the anticipated spectacle of her squirming with humiliation.

Yet, Hannah's response was nothing more than a tranquil,utterly composed smile. She didn't rush to answer. Instead, her eyes found Vincent's across the room first.

Vincent's features hardened visibly, his brow drawing together as his gaze sliced toward Vera with clear disapproval.

Hannah absorbed Vincent's reaction  with quiet acknowledgment before turning back to Vera, her tone
acknowledgment before turning back to Vera, her tone remaining measured but cutting like precision steel. "Miss Oliver, you appear remarkably knowledgeable about my personal affairs for someone I only met hours ago."
###Chapter 663 You'll Kneel Before Me And Serve Me...
Vera shifted slightly under Hannah's steady gaze but kept her expression light,forcing out a breezy smile. "Friends should get to know each other better, shouldn't they?"

Hannah's soft laugh cut through the tension. Her eyes swept across the gathered guests before settling deliberately on Vincent. She answered with complete clarity, "Yes, I'm divorced."Her voice remained steady and precise. "But there was no infidelity. Not in body, not in heart."

She held Vincent's gaze the entire time.

The directness of her response gave some of the judgmental onlookers pause, forcing them to reconsider their hasty conclusions.

But there were always people who fed on chaos.

Boyce was infamous in Vera's circle as a troublemaker who lived for spectacle. Nothing thrilled him more than being the instigator of drama. He sensed the simmering tension and pounced on it. His eyebrows shot up as he called out to Hannah with mock enthusiasm, "Ms. Scott, I've just thought of a more exciting challenge. Are you brave enough to try it?"

Hannah could feel the hostility radiating from this group,but she was curious to see how far they'd go. She replied with a note of defiance threading through her tone, "Really? Mr.Hughes, I'm dying to hear what you have in mind."

Vera couldn't hide her eagerness to watch Hannah squirm. She jumped in quickly. "Boyce always knows how to liven things up.Ms. Scott, you really should give it a shot. Consider it part of making new connections."
Boyce's grin turned predatory as he announced his vulgar proposal for everyone to hear, "It's incredibly simple! Ms. Scott,you need to call your ex-husband right this second and tell him this exactly-"

He paused for effect, letting his words hang in the air with deliberate crudeness, "You will say, 'I still can't stop thinking about how you felt in bed.' Then, ask him if he'd like to sleep with you again! What do you say? Thrilling, isn't it? Ha-ha!"

Vincent's face turned to stone. His glare at Boyce could have cut glass.

Completely absorbed in his own performance, Boyce threw his head back and roared with laughter. His equally obnoxious friends joined in with whistles and jeering applause.

"Boyce, that's absolutely genius!"

"Absolutely thrilling! Ms. Scott, are you up for it?"

Vera's smile faltered. She hadn't anticipated Boyce would suggest something this crude. Her eyes darted to Vincent. He was staring at Hannah, his jaw tight and his brow creased with tension.

Vera's hands curled into fists. She'd wanted to humiliate Hannah, yes, but not at the expense of dragging Vincent into this mess. She opened her mouth to stop this, but Boyce was too caught up in his own momentum. He even rose from his seat,ignoring her completely.

Hannah showed no trace of anger at the vulgar challenge.Instead, she studied Vincent's rigid expression and released a quiet laugh.

When Hannah smiled wordlessly, Boyce mistook it for fear. He pushed harder, his voice dripping with mockery. "What's the matter, Ms. Scott? Can't handle a little game?"

Hannah shifted her attention to Boyce at last, her voice unnervingly calm. "Fear has nothing to do with it." She tilted her head slighntly. "I'm simply curious about something. If I actually make this call and say exactly what you're demanding,what happens then?"

Boyce waved his hand carelessly. "Simple. I'll down three shots!Fair trade, wouldn't you say?"

Hannah shook her head slowly, amusement playing at the corners of her mouth. "Three shots? That's hardly worth mentioning. It doesn't do justice to the 'genius' game you've created."

Boyce blinked in confusion. "Then what do you want?"

Hannah leaned forward ever so slightly, her gaze pinning Boyce in place with suffocating intensity. Her words came out measured and clear, "What I'm asking for isn't complicated. If I follow through with your little game, you'll kneel before me and serve me wine. You'll keep pouring, glass after glass,until I'm satisfied. Until I say you can stop. Only then do you stand."

A dangerous smile curved her lips. "Now that's what I call fun.What do you say, Mr. Hughes?"
###Chapter 664 My Ex-husband Is Already Here
"You!" Boyce's face turned scarlet, his pride seared raw beneath the laughter surrounding him. "That's crossing the line!"

"Crossing the line?" Hannah echoed mockingly, her voice laced with a teasing bite. "Weren't we all just playing around for fun a moment ago? Why is it that when it's your turn,you suddenly can't handle it?"

"Who says I can't handle it!" His temper snapped like a live wire.In a flare of bravado, he barked, "Fine then! We'll do it your way! But this time, I'm raising the stakes!"

Driven by the need to reclaim his dignity, Boyce leaned forward,eyes flashing. "You won't just make the call-you'll have to get your ex-husband here! Then, right in front of all of us,you'll repeat those same words to him! That's the real dare! Do you have the guts?"

"Agreed." Hannah's reply came quick, calm, and cutting. Her gaze swept over the crowd like a blade. "You all heard him.Every one of you is a witness."

Vera's composure faltered instantly. With Vincent here, Boyce was bound to lose this game. A bitter unease twisted in her stomach. The last thing she wanted was Vincent getting entangled with Hannah again.

Hoping to quench the fire before it spread, Vera forced a shaky smile. "Come on, let's not go overboard. We're all friends-let's just laugh it off and have another drink, alright?"

But Boyce, still burning with humiliation and provoked by Hannah, refused to retreat. He leaned close to Vera, muttering under his breath, "Weren't you the one who told us to give her
der his breath, "Weren't you the one who told us to give her a hard time? What's with the sudden change of heart?"

Their whispered exchange was abruptly cut short. Hannah,having observed enough, pulled out her phone with unhurried grace. "I'm starting," she announced, her tone laced with calm defiance.

Vera's pulse spiked in panic. She reached out instinctively. "Ms.Scott,don't-please. It's just a silly game; there's no reason to take it this far."

But Hannah acted as if she hadn't heard Vera. Her fingers glided smoothly across the screen. When she lifted her gaze again, her eyes found Vincent, seated opposite her-silent,unreadable.

All attention shifted toward Hannah and the glowing phone set to speaker mode.

Vera's palms grew clammy. Boyce and his friends watched in tense anticipation, hungry for drama.

The ringing tone filled the air.

Every eye in the room was fixed on Hannah, waiting for her to stumble, to falter, to make a fool of herself.

Vera's focus,however, stayed on Vincent, clinging to a fragile strand of hope. Surely, he wouldn't indulge Hannah with this game. Surely, he wouldn't answer.

The phone kept ringing, and Vera felt somewhat steadied.He wasn't going to pick up.

But the next moment, before Vera could rejoice, the call connected.

Vera's face turned pale, noticing Vincent's phone screen light up. Everyone else was focused on Hannah and missed Vincent's actions.
Hannah's gaze locked on Vincent, unwavering.

Vincent's brows furrowed as he waited silently for her to speak.

Yet, Hannah didn't speak. Instead, she turned back to the others, her voice even. "The call connected. That covers Mr.Hughes' first condition."

With a light tap, she ended the call, the corners of her lips curving faintly.′′Asfor the second part," she continued, "that's done as well. My ex-husband is already here."

"What?" Boyce barked out a derisive laugh. He didn't even consider the possibility. To him, it was an empty boast. "What kind of nonsense is that? Your ex-husband is here already?What,does he have teleportation powers now? You're bluffing.You didn't dare go through with it, and now you're trying to save face. Isn't that right, everyone?"

With a smug look, he looked around for agreement.

His cronies echoed him instantly.

"Exactly! Who are you trying to fool?"

"Ms. Scott, you didn't even say a word before hanging up!That's guilt written all over you! Looks like you're the loser tonight!"

"Boyce, what's her punishment?"

Boyce stroked his jaw, his grin lewd and triumphant. "Ms. Scott,since you've lost, my demand's simple. You'll slip into a sexy maid outfit and serve me wine on your knees. Sounds fair,doesn't it? Ha-ha!"

The laughter curdled in Boyce's throat as Vincent's cold stare cut across the room-sharp,glacial, deadly. Their eyes met,and for an instant, Boyce felt the temperature drop. His smirk faltered,unease prickling down his spine.
"Boyce!"' Vera interjected sharply, her voice tight with alarm."That's enough-don't push it any further!"

But her words held no weight now. Boyce ignored her and called for a maid uniform, too lost in his self-convinced victory.

Through the ridicule and commotion, Hannah's expression remained placid, her faint smile exuding quiet control."Interesting choice," she said at last, her tone calm but edged with steel.′′Amaid uniform... I can accept that." Her eyes sharpened, her voice cutting through the noise like a blade."But the one wearing it won't be me. It'll be you, Mr. Hughes.Wearing the maid uniform, you'll be the one on your knees,pouring my drink until I say stop."

Boyce burst into loud laughter, the sound exaggerated and scornful. "You've lost your mind, Hannah! You failed to complete my dare, and yet you still expect me to take the punishment?"

His voice rose, brimming with mockery. "You made the call,sure-but where's your ex-husband? Where is he, huh? You clearly lost! Stop pretending otherwise!"
